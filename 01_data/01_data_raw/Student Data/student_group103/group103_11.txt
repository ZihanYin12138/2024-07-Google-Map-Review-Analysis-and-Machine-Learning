The preview on the copy machine looks good but in the printed out part of the text got cut off. Asked one of the staffs for help but got response that "there is no way to fix it". Thankfully I didn't print all the documents I planned to.</Text>

The assistant manager Andrew was professional, knowledgeable...and easy on the eyes. I was returning some rental books and after waiting 20min at the Amazon store, the guy tells me I needed the FedEx labels first. Andrew helped me get my labels after a few attempts.  Thank you!< /Text>

<review>Tom was very helpful, turning around our order very quickly at a very reasonable price. Not necessarily the closest print shop to me, but I'd make the trip back again. Everything you need in a good print shop- fast, reasonably priced, and a quality job.<//review>< UserId.>

I basically cannot go back to the USA simply because of their mistake! They have received my package but never told me until they have sent back my important document for me to re-enter the US. Then they tell me that it is not their fault that I didn’t get any notification, and told me check my spam folder, which of course I already checked everything. (WHY did you email me AFTER sending my stuff back to the sender?! Doesn’t make any sense)  their staff have awful attitude and kept telling me to come into the office and show them my ID, even though I told them I am literally in another country and I cannot even go back to the USA because of their mistake. They simply don’t care.<//text>

<Text>Worst costumer service you will ever experience. There is zero sense of urgency and the store completely lacks efficiency. Employees will literally stand around doing seemingly nothing and not at all acknowledge the costumers. Service is also very inconsistent. If going to another location was possible I would.< /Text>< time>

<review>I was the only customer in line and waited 20 minutes to mail a document. Rosa(Rose?) kept ignoring me and my friend for 20 MINUTES! Unbelievable! She walked around, chat with coworkers, picked up trash, walked around over and over and over again. She did everything except working and ignoring customers in line! Super disappointed! Thanks to another employee who cannot bear anymore and help us out.<//review>< pictures>

This place usually holds packages for a couple days just for fun I guess, but this month a new personal record was set. 11 days!!!!! My package was kept there for 11 days without being processed, I came and asked for it and they were rude even though they’re some of the worst workers in the village, just impressive the lack of care USC has shown the entire villages packages< /Review>

Picking up packages is always incredibly slow. Perpetually understaffed. Often lose things, and in shipping expensive equipment (computer), their improper packaging resulted in fatal damages, and their “guarantee” didn’t cover it.</Text>

Why does it take so long for a package to be processed for pickup? When a package arrives at FedEx, pick up notification should be sent the same day. Who is managing this place? Does FedEx Corp. know this?</Review>

Super disappointing experience, takes forever seemingly only because of inefficiency. Every time I’ve ever visited, it’s been a mess of long lines, while all of the employees huddle around single projects.  Maybe it’s been just a series of isolated, bad employee experiences, but it seems often like they really don’t want to help— they just want to get people out of there.</review>

I’ve had about one good experience here, but all the other ones are very slow. They need more than 2 people working, especially if one is in training. It’s frustrating to have to pick up a package and wait 20 mins.<//Text>

This place is terribly slow, I have been waiting the printing one sheet of paper for 30 minutes already, don’t know how much am I gonna wait still. Really disappointed. Looks like Lisabeth, staff member,  doesn’t care anything.</text>

(Translated by Google) Super bad. Very slow. It takes us two hours to print a dozen pages. Haha, why don't you just say you don't want to print it?

(Original)
超级烂。很慢很慢。打印十几页要我们等2小时。呵呵，干嘛不直接说不想印呢。< /Text>

<user_name>Ed Eddison< /user_name><time>1509827058430< /time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>My wife and I live in Oakland and came in today with our employee for an 8 hour CPR, AED, and first aid class. We initially wanted to renew our certification at a married couple's house who offer it in Alameda (much closer to us) - this was where we originally received our certification at. Fortunately they were full and we got to do the Adams Safety Training experience!

Training here at AST has been fun, informative, and engaging. Josh was our instructor. His energetic attitude made for a more pleasant time despite the long 8 hour timeframe. Many great questions were asked and Josh knew his stuff. The hands-on with the adult, child, and infant dummies was great as well!< /text>< pictures>

I took the CPR class with Izaak, he was very informative and I definitely finished off with way more information than I thought I’d be offered. He went above and beyond with the information he gave us, he used his own teaching style to make this class entertaining and fun. Very hands on training, super helpful!<//Review>

<review>I took the 8 hr CPR class with Izaak, he was very informative and  a great instructor. He made sure we knew we can ask questions and he would answer the best way he could. I learned so much information I thought I knew about but obviously not enough. He's very passionate about his job and you can tell he cares about us learning and that he is not just here because he has to be! Great class, great information, Totally recommend!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I had an 8 hour class with Izaak as the teacher, even though I was tired, his teaching style kept me able to stay engaged. Through the 8 hour class he broke things down into a digestible format, between talking, demonstrating, explaining, and taking all questions.
I would definitely take another class of his!< /Text>

I received pediatric cpr and first aid training with Izaak in San Jose. The training was very thorough and immersive! Izaak was a great teacher! Extensive knowledge and experience! Everyone and Anyone who has a kid or cares for kids should have this training! It should be common knowledge for the public! Class was fun and I look forward to more trainings in the future! Thank you!<//Review>

<review>Hi, I attended the Cpr class from 8:00am-4:00pm and must admit I enjoyed myself.  Not only did I enjoy myself but I actually learned the proper way, step by step of performing CPR on adults, a child & infants.  Our instructor  Mr. Izaak was very detailed & answered all questions correctly.  He was very intelligent & made the class very interesting.  Thank you so much for all the wonderful knowledge Mr. Izaak
I highly appreciate you!

<review>Adams Training is THE place to go for safety training! I have done many classes here and always use them for my CPR renewal. Izaak was the instructor for the latest training I took for Health and Safety and he was so awesome! Izaak is very knowledgeable and also made a long tedious class fun! He is very personable and that makes SUCH a difference when attending these long classes! I would highly recommend Adams Safety Training and if you’re lucky, you’ll get Izaak as your instructor!<//review>< Pics>

<gmapID>0x808ff2c450d2aa3b:0xfc20df97e24d8e0b< /gmapID><Text>Adams Safety is one of the few EMSA approved trainers for the health, safety, and nutrition course for child care providers and has a good number of options for classes and locations. I took the course in San Ramon during COVID. The class was small (so was the room) but there was space for social distancing. That said, I was a little surprised that temperatures weren’t taken at the start of class. The emails said to arrive 15min early to register, but having arrived 15min early, was told I should wait til class started. Marlena was the instructor and she clearly loves her job - great energy and enthusiasm. Due to COVID though, what sounds like would otherwise be an active hands-on class was largely just listening to a summary of the e-book for the class (you do not get a textbook, even though the email says you will). Breaks are built in, but licensing requires that you are in the class for the full 8hrs no matter what so be prepared to stay the full amount of time.</Text><Rating>4<//Rating><Pics>None< /Pics>< Date>

<text>This the 4th time I have taken the CPR and first aid training class at Adams Safety Training. All sessions were informative, current and worthwhile. This session taught by Izaak has been the best so far. He was very knowledgable and presented the information in a clear, concise way that was easy to understand and remember.</text>< pictures>

I took the pediatric CPR & first aid class at the San Jose Four Seasons location with Janae and she was a great teacher. The class was clear and informative. She made it interesting so it didn't feel like we were bored for 8 hours. I'm doing the San Ramon class with Izaak today and he is funny and personable. Both are very knowledgeable of the information.< /Text>

I’m in the middle of the class right now and it is unlike any other CPR class I have ever taken. The guy leading the class is teaching us in a simple and fun way where in the first half an hour I already learned more than I have in any other safety class. It’s really hands on and I feel as though in a situation where I would need to help I would be able to. I recommend!!< /text>

Awesome class. The best presentation of the material. Izaac’s experience was greatly appreciated. This class really lived up to the company’s motto of “Learning to saves lives made easy.” The simplifying of the content will help make it stick in individual’s minds, which is what the ultimate goal is in order for it to make a difference when it’s time to utilize the skills.<//Text>

< Review>
I took a 4 hour pediatric CPR class and for the million classes I’ve taken this one left the biggest impact on my knowledge. I feel so confident in giving CPR now . Josh was my instructor and he was so involved with the class, for an 8am class he kept it alive it didn’t even feel that early. It is as well one of the cheaper CPR classes i found. I highly recommend this class if training is needed!!< /Review>

<text>I took the 8 hour class at Adams Safety Training and really enjoyed it. I never expected it to be boring but I did not know it would be so much fun! The instructor Ray Adams is very good at explaining all the information and keeping the class informative and entertaining.
There are snacks and water available at the training, which was a big plus for me and especially useful since the class was 8 hours.
Overall this class was great and I would recommend it to anyone that is required to take it or interested in learning about CPR / First Aid.< /text>< Pics>

The Adams Safety Training class that I took with Izaac was so informative. It was detailed, and had a lot of practical information that is up to date with the times. The content and experiences are relatable, interesting and socially aware. I enjoyed the class, and wish more people had access .<//Review>

Adam’s Safety Training was extremely helpful. Ray used clear and effective  methods in order to help us retain the information. He was very kind and took the time to answer any questions that we brought up. He was extremely engaged and enthusiastic about the training that all the teachers, that were in attendance, became interested in the course as well. Overall, when the time comes I will definitely renew my certification with Adam’s Safety Training!< /Text>

<text>The instructor is very knowledgeable and patient. Although the class was crowed he remained calm and patient and quickly readjusted the room to accommodate the class. Izacck is very intune, experienced and well versed. This class comes highly recommended by me. Just be prepared for a full class which for me says something great about the instructor beyond the need to have CPR for work. Izacck was upbeat and responded without hesitation to all questions which were encouraged. Overall great class. He should be granted a larger space to aide in accommodating all in need.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<review>Ray was great. He has a very great understanding of what we need to know about  healthy and safety. Very friendly. Very approachable. He has alot of experience. Donuts, water, and candy available for your convenience. Arrive early to make the registration process faster. 5 min or so breaks every hour and a 30 minute lunch break. Very reasonable. 8 hour class does not feel like it. With the break up of breaks and video clips. Overall it's also a great environment to talk and learn from everyone else in the class. Their experiences and questions.</review>< userid>

<Text>I took the Preventative Health & Safety class with Ray, he is an amazing instructor and made everyone feel open to sharing their questions and concerns with any topics that came up. He went over the information very thoroughly to make sure we all understood before moving onto something else. I highly recommend this class, it is super easy, interesting, and you will definitely learn a few new things you didn't know you should even know. I look forward to taking the CPR class tomorrow and feel confident in taking what I learned out into the real world. 😊</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

It was interactive, straight forward, and to the point. I like the "green" aspect of the course and being given the opportunity to have electronic copies for us to download if we want it. The facility and room was easy to find and parking was available for free onsite. Our instructor Josh was personable and knowledgeable. He answered any and every question asked in class. The classroom was a comfortble temperature and perfect size for our group especially for an 8 hour course. I highly recommend Adams Safety Training.< /review>< Pictures>

Great class Mr.Adams is very clear when speaking gives multiple 10 minute breaks plus a 30 minute break. The class also provides donuts, candy, cold and room temperature water. Mr. Adams tell a lot about his personal life or friend experiences as related topics arrive. The health and training course is a flying 8 hours and is very enduring and easy to remember recent discussed topics.</text>

I was looking for a CPR class that met the requirements for my nursing school. My friend recommended this place and said she had a really great experience. The sign up was extremely easy, The instructor was helpful and made the class fun. I really enjoyed the atmosphere because it wasn't just about watching a boring video, but rather, very hands on! Nice Training class!< /review>

My 2nd time taking this class here and I actually like it. Great environment and teachers have been great. They even let me bring my son  and let him sit in the corner. I just brought his coloring books. Very affordable and they are American Association approved. I will cont to take my BLS here and I recommend this place.</Review>

I was glad to find the CPR/ First Aid training on infants, children, and adults provided by Adams Safety on Eventbrite held by Solano County Family and Child Services. Joshua was very informative and it was well worth my Saturday spent. If ever heavens forbids that I won’t have to use none of the training but glad to know I have the knowledge to perform in times of emergency:</review>

<review>This company is accessable and enjoyable. They can be found easily on the web and the hours available are varied with lots of choices for busy families or individuals. The prices are fair and they have kept up with possible local discounts or renumerations from your local county offices.
The classes themselves are interactive and informative, as well as considerate. They will make sure that, if you have any other needs  (queasy reaction to videos, medical needs, or just tired, etc.) that they can accommodate,  they will.
I highly recommend this program for all employees, from assistant teachers to CEO's.< /review><GmapID>0x808ff2c450d2aa3b:0xfc20df97e24d8e0b< /GmapID>< Resp>

Their lunch specials are a great price and perfect portion of food. My favorite is the yellow curry, papaya salad, and Thai tea. The larb once I've had was too spicy for level 1 heat, but everything else is exceptional. I'm always impressed with the food.</text>< Pics>

My first time to Siam I Am. The food was amazing! We got the Kung Prik Pao shrimp, pineapple fried rice, pad see ew with chicken and pa nang with beef.  Everything was very flavorful and authentic. We are definitely going back. The service was great as well! Thank you for a great experience.< /review>

< review>
There are quite a few Thai restaurants in the south bay, and I've tried at least a dozen of them. So ignore the 5, 4, 3 star reviews.  I'll start with - SLOW DELIVERY! Took an hour. I'm only 6-7 miles away. Portions - SMALLEST I've had from any Thai restaurant. Usually order entrees for family of 3 and we were still hungry. Didn't even finish because food tasted HORRIBLE.. Pad see ew -  broccoli had a sour, strange taste, definitely not fresh, fried tofu was chewy (previously frozen?), noodles were dry. Green curry - super WATERY, not creamy like coconut milk. Fried rice w/shrimp - NOTHING to write home about. Cross this place off your list. I AM!</review>

Very good authentic Burmese food at a good price. Service was on point. The tea leaf salad with dried shrimp was fantastic and very flavorful. Mango salad and chicken curry also very good. Always busy so arrive early.<//Review>

*The shrimp comes with 8, my family couldn't wait*
This place was one of those places we literally just dove right into, and so glad we did. Proudly displaying their grade A this small restaurant has such great food. This particular night we(two kids, two adults) ordered; Thai dumplings, fried shirmp, orange chicken, chicken curry, seafood combination chow mein, and mango lemonade. Everything was hot, seasoned, and cooked properly, well worth the money. We will most definitely be back.<//Text>

Just right for breaking weather...cold and rainy today. This little cozy cafe offers the great Thai taste in soups...and other dishes.
I had the coconut chicken soup. Very satisfying!
They also offer free delivery...great when you don't want to get out in it.
Very pleasant man greeted me...very accommodating.
Pricing is right.
I will difinantly go back.<//Text>

Called my order in in Saturday evening, the gentleman helping me was very kind and cool, I had literally parked outside to call order in, place is a bit on the small side but still cool spot! Popped in 10min later and food was ready. Also ordered a large Thai tea, which are always typically super sweet, so we just water it down and boom, now you have 2 Thai teas for price of one. And Healthier, who knew.  So recently coming from thailand, I can say that this was equivalent, if not better than out there, there coconut soup is The BEST! Paired with some white rice, boom. As you can tell from the pic, I devoured pad-sea-ew, which was a little overdone but still good! Come check them out! Later< /text>

It was very delicious!!! To drink i got the mango tea, i had no idea it was going to be that amazing, it had puree mango at the bottom to mix in and WOW the combination left me wanting way more. Give this place a try i will be coming again. Just heads up only 4 tables to seat so its small and cozy but 1000% worth it.<//Text>< pictures>

Love this spot for the lunch special. Also been back in the evening time - we really enjoyed it but it will probably be a one off thing since portions were not what we like. The lady who works there is very attentive & kind. It's a great place for a first date!</Review>

<Review>Juicy the owner is super sweet.
best prices lunch specials around
small family business with passion and delish food.
they now have duck and it's so tasty.
they enhanced their menu to offer tapas sized menu options as like a tasting menu which is awesome.
their pad Thai w/green beans is bomb.
only a few tables inside so they're mostly take out.
street parking in front.
South Redondo so a bit out of the way and completely worth it!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

For the price, we received almost no food and barely any meat. The meal was extremely salty and the food was old. Confused about the reviews. Maybe they've changed? Expected it to be great due to those reviews. Sadly disappointed and out 30 bucks /:</Text>

<Review>The joyous greeting was incredible and on that note alone I'll be back. The food is prepared with great care and has the authentic flavours I want in Thai cuisine. Prices matched portions and I am looking forward to going through the menu. Bon appetite.<//Review>< pics>

Just really bad food. Not fresh, no taste extremely disappointed. It had great reviews online but apparently nobody knows what real good Thai food taste like because this is probably the worst I’ve ever had in my life. I actually had to stop eating because I was concerned about getting sick. James Freeman< /review>

<review>Did not experience any problems...I am very picky and peculiar about where I get my food.  This small place did exceed my expectations. I ordered the beef salad and wontons so so yummy and delicious. I took my food to go this place rocks in prepping my to go bag.  When I got home everything that was packed was neat and tidy. The only thing that bothered me was the dining-in area needed some major cleaning and dusting. Overall I will definately go back but I won't be dining in that is for sure.</review>< pics>

The best yellow coconut curry I have had to date.  They have brown rice too, so extra star for that.  Their chicken is very lean and yummy.</Text>

I just take out my red curry and it's very small portion with no rice and only 3 pieces of chicken for $8.95. It's very close to my house so i ordered a few times but somehow their portions have been chanced. Never will go back.< /review>

This lil bodega is a good place to shop if you want to avoid the crowded supermarkets. They have a butcher on staff and can cut your meat right there and there.<//Review>

<review>Staff is so nice and they have a pretty good selecrion of things considering they size of the place. Much bigger than it looks from the outside. Bought some meat, it was fresh and good quality. Veggies looked fresh too. Everything was well priced.< /review>< user>

<user_name>Esmeralda Chavis<//user_name><Time>1613070615957< /Time><rate>1<//rate><Review>(Translated by Google) I have always liked to go shopping here although it makes me dear this time I felt disappointed. I went and bought meats to make beef broth (Beef soup) all the meat was fine except for the beef tail that I ordered and I realized until the soup (the broth) was cooked at the time of eating the beef tail It made a bad smell and a rather unpleasant taste and good, I just removed the glue from the broth but still it felt in the broth for not throwing it away we decided to eat it because I spent about 70 to make the broth and we all had stomach pain hehehe that's all . If they ask me if I would go there again, of course if I would give another chance, it may have been the first time and there will not be another second time.

(Original)
Siempre me a gustado ir a comprar aqui aunque se me hace carito esta vez me senti decepcionada. Fui y compre carnes para hacer caldo de res(Sopa de res)  toda la carne estaba bien ecepto la cola de res que pedi y me di cuenta asta que ya estaba cocida la sopa(el caldo) a la hora de comer la cola de res hechaba un mal olor y un gusto bastante desagradable  y bueno solo quite removi la cola de el caldo pero aun asi se sentia en el caldo por no tirarlo decidimos comerlo por que gaste como 70para hacer el caldo y resultamos todos con dolor estomacal hehehe eso es todo. Si me preguntan si volveria ir ahi, Claro si daria otra oportunidad puede que aya sido la primera vez y no haiga otra segunda vez.<//Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) It is good to come and get distracted and buy very Mexican things if you are looking for your molcajete or your metate and even zarape you will find ... Take a walk you will like it!

This is a decent mall to find items from shoes, clothes, jewelry, handbags, trolleys, etc. The price range is quite good. You don't have to worry because all the items are of good quality. It’s also an air-conditioned mall which is an added advantage. We really enjoyed our day so much because we bought a lot of things and the quality is super nice! Worth it!</review>

<text>I went to this mall yesterday morning, and I greatly loved the place, products, saleslady, cashiers, and stores, restaurants, etc., to the upper level. Honestly, I bought all the new clothes that I want for myself, and I was impressed by it, for it was of good quality. Next time, I needed to buy something for myself and hang out if I have free time, I will surely come back here. Thanks for the wonderful experience!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80d95693ac71dbc1:0x545683cd57caf787< /gmapID></record>

< Review>
A well-organized, spacious mall, a big food court.    Everything in here was impressive. They have a playroom, salon, spa,  and even an activity center for grown-ups.   On each floor, they had customer service. The parking was space can accommodate a lot of vehicles. The staves were very attentive and professional. What a lovely mall to shop with.</Review>

<Text>Crowded on a Saturday, but managed to find a parking spot to visit Amazing Nails for my 1st dip. Felt a bit rushed and came out looking 'thicker' than I expected (compared to gel), but maybe that's why they're supposed to last longer. Price was decent. $35 for dip on natural nails.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Food was different, but in a pleasant way.  Customer service was great with an atmosphere to match.  Definitely great hole-in-the wall dining to help dodge the fast food joints.  #ShopLocal<//Review>

I loved the atmosphere of this place! But I ordered 2 805 draft beers and it was $15.50!! I was afraid to order food after that. There were great sandwiches on the menu, giant soft pretzels ( 7 bucks) smoothies, all sorts of goodies but my wallet was feeling skinny that day.< /Text>

I love that The Beach has fresh and healthy options... especially thankful for the vegan options! I always seem to crave it when they're closed, but now and then, I catch them during business hours. Last time, I got a sandwich with hummus, cucumbers, sprouts, tomatoes. The bread was fresh and delicious. We also enjoyed a side of sliced vegetables with hummus and a Dole Whip to drink. It was more than I could eat in one meal, so I enjoyed some of it later.
I love to eat on the patio outside, enjoy the music, and someday, I'll get there for a live music performance (which they host regularly). Once, I watched a launch from the patio, great view and a comfortable seat!
One wish would be to offer vegan options for substitutes in the smoothies. Honey is a no go for me. I got a berry smoothie once but I was disappointed with no yogurt option and no sweetener... I got only berries, ice, and water :( but I know that it is only a matter of time and availability.
Thank you to the owner and employees for providing a much needed haven.</Text>

Not worth the money! Pizza was undercooked, the toppings on my prosciutto pizza were drenched in balsamic glaze giving it a sweet/acidic taste. The fresh juice is a rip off at $8 a glass.</text>

<Text>Best venue for a bite to eat, sipping wine or beer and listening to music. Last act was a "WOW" world class experience, in the little town of Lompoc.

Great ambience, friendly staff and customers, it's almost like being in another, friendlier country without the 13 hour flight. LOL</Text>< Pictures>

The Beach has great ambience, lilies adorn the tables and provide a tropical scent along with the beach/surf memorabilia. The smoothies are very good, I had the peanut butter banana smoothie and it was delicious! The wood fire pizzas take some time to make however, so if you're in a lunch rush, it might be better to get a sandwich or soup here instead. The pizzas are well worth the wait though. It's hard to beat the quality of a wood-fire pizza if you've never had one. They also have a list of yummy specials outside by the entrance.
There is outside seating in addition to beers and wines on tap! Though The Beach usually closes at 3pm, you can still have a righteous happy hour on Fridays as they're open till 9pm. They offer some local beverages, vegan dessert, and great choices between salads, sandwiches, and pizzas. Don't miss this hole-in-the-wall gem located in Old Town!<//Review>

<name>Stephen Salvatore<//name><time>1542698714165< /time><rating>2</rating><text>I want to like this place for the atmosphere but that is where it ends. while they have a creative and option robust menu, the staff are too young to pour you anything but water (which they don't). They consistently forget orders and under cook their wood fire pizzas. The soups, salads and sandwiches are great when they aren't 86'd. If you enjoy raw, Ash slathered, over priced pizza that claims to be gourmet, this is your spot. Staff was friendly, nervous and clearly unprepared. This place has a lot of potential, but fails to meet many basic food handling standards. If you're here for live music, eat before hand and enjoy the great selection of drinks they have, that you should be prepared to pour yourself.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>It was my 3rd.t try here.  Friday night was not the optimal time for food. Pizza was overcooked & under topped. The cost &.size  of the pizza should have allowed for more topping. Mine had a hole in the crust.  It seems Friday is all about the beer & the grunge crowd.  We did not get to listen to the music because we were getting squeezed out. It is best for a younger crowd that are between 18-22.<//Text><response>None<//response><time>1550240609603</time><gmapID>0x80ec1eeb31abf9e5:0x4f37f992ea928570<//gmapID><rating>2< /rating></record>

I was a bit disconcerted to see them put the big stainless steel bowl of flour on the floor but they did not place that bowl back on the counter while we were there ....  still a bit odd, really shouldn't be putting the foodstuffs on the floor!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I wouldn't rank this place as affordable especially based on the style of food sold (Sandwiches, salads and personal pizzas). But the quality is top notch, and the dining area's style is unbeatable. They're friendly and fastidious here- a worthwhile combination.</review>

The only thing worse than the food is the service. Also, might possibly be an illegal child labor sweat shop. Ordered a beer on tap and had to go behind the counter to pour my own. Of the five or more waitresses working at the time none were old enough to serve alcohol. Air Force brat / Teen hangout spot at best< /Review>

One hour wait for 2 subs, a smoothie, and a juice. We don’t blame the young lady making all the food; it was rush hour on a Saturday and she was the only staff member working. I’m very disappointed, however, that management of this facility allowed this situation to happen. We won’t be coming back.</Text>

My husband and I have conducted many successful business transactions here.
I highly recommend Ore Pawn should you need an honest pawnbroker.
I had to put my trust in these guys, and their integrity and business ethics are spot on.
We are so thankful we picked these guys over the other shops in the area.</Text>

I highly recommend this pawnshop, I’m from Sacramento and moved out here to Yuba City not to long ago and I have been doing business with all kinds of pawnshops for years and this one is most definitely in the top 3.. I went to prison and was worried I was going to lose my stuff I had put a loan on but they allowed my wife to make the payment for me until I got out.most pawnshops would have just kept my stuff but they didn’t so I recommend them for sure!< /Text>

If you are looking for beat up and broken musical instruments and would like to pay the full price, as if for a new item of the same model this is the place for you. Same for the tools on display, full new price for broken, damaged  and incomplete tools.<//Review>

Recommended In by a good friend of mine I came in looking for some jewelry for myself and a few surprises for the Family . I managed to get everything I came in for plus a few goodies on the side 😁 so much selection and my mind is indecisive but being educated on the items and detail which I love helped me take care of that making sure I had a smile on my face when I walked out the door and still ! Awesome folks and great selection ! Definite recommendation from our family to yours ! Thanks Kiana And The Family @ Oro Jewelry and Loan ! ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️</review>

<Time>1577146759196< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>If you are doing a gun transfer here, expect about an hour for original gun transfer, expect staff to ask you questions because they aren't sure what they are suppose to do while calling other stores for answers on how to do the trasnfer, wait your 10 day period by California's standard, then wait an additional 4-5 days for an employee who can finish the transfer to actually be at work (called 3 days in a row and no one was certfied to give me my gun), and when that worker is there, expect another 20-25 minutes to actually recieve the handgun.  Employees here do not know the process for transfering a gun and I cannot believe that only 1 person is certified to do the paperwork.  I would have/will be going somewhere to do any transfer with guns.  Also, staff does not know how to load/unload weapons properly.< /review>< pics>

My friend warned me about this place I was Sceptable when I first got thier to pawn a Item of mine. I pawned it oct 24 My Item.  lost the Receipt paper so I went in a month before my 3 month mark was over to ask how much how time I had before I had to pay the late fee for I wouldn’t of end up paying more then was needed too. They told feb 24. I came feb on the 8th thinking I was more then on time to get back.. that was not the case.. over all I tryed to Talke to the manager she kept talking over me trying too indicate that was lying or that I was wrong over all. I felt like got token advantage for them to make a quick buck!  I would not recommend this place anybody. I suggest to go to the Marysville pawnshop If I was able to give this place a half a star. I would be more appropriate. Thank you guys. Hope this helps to anyone that cares to see the reviews.</Text>

Gave me about 50 bucks for a ring with gold spot price value around 800 bucks. Wouldn't give my gf more that 75 dollar loan on a 24kt gold necklace worth around 1000 dollars.

They take advantage of people and give them horrible offers on their merchandise. Best collateral is a much better pawn shop</Text>

We drove over 450 miles to purchase a 2018 Flex from them. We did this because of the outstanding service Andrew gave us. He always answered our questions promptly, he took time to FaceTime with us and walk around the car so we could see it closer up and when we arrived at the dealership there were no surprises Everything! was as promised. Thank you Monarch Ford.<//Text>

The salesmen  were polite,did not pressure me at all. Had room to look around at the Ranger. Test drove it and went into office with salesman to get a very good deal on my new 2020 Ford Ranger. Very pleased with Ford and my new Ford Ranger.< /review>

I have been doing business with Monarch Ford for nearly three years now with no issues. The service and sales staff is always very friendly and eager to help. Its especially appreciated that they patiently explain the process of the service work so I know what to expect. They wont leave you in the dark in my experience. Sales has a clean feeling and is professional and hassle free. I absolutely recommend Monarch Ford. They are worth it.< /Text>

My wife and I saw a car we were interested in purchasing on Monarch Ford's website. We live about 45 miles away from the dealership but we decided to take the drive out there. We were very glad that we did. I can honestly say that our buying experience at Monarch Ford was one of the easiest, and fastest car buying experiences we have had in a long time. Our salesman Richard was a really nice guy. He wasn't obnoxious and didn't pressure us at all. He owned the same vehicle, that we ended up purchasing, so he was very knowledgeable about the vehicle's features and specifications. After we test drove the vehicle, my wife and I decided to buy it. Normally at this point in the car buying experience it becomes slow, and sometimes stressful. That wasn't the case at Monarch Ford. Our purchasing experience after the test drive was quick and smooth. I highly recommend Monarch Ford in Exeter and when we need another vehicle, my wife and I will definitely be going back there.<//Text>

Difficult electrical repair needed.  Called for appt and they worked around my schedule.  Had a problem and called me.  Kept me posted every step of the way.  It is FIXED where others had failed.  Not close to home for me but worth the drive.  FIVE STARS to service department.<//Review>

They even did work on my car that i had to pay for that didnt fix the issue so all together i paid them 1100 $ for them.not to fix my car. They replaced the heat sensor in a pipe and looked for a frayed wire behind the radio and nothing. The next step was to do the wire harness which was upward. Of a thousand. Dollars. So then they suggested i take it to a specialist cause they cant fix it and i said you are the ford dealership how much more special does it get. So then they suggested i get a new car which they couldnt help me with either. Horrible place to take your vehicle with such a bad experienc with ford in Visalia and ford in exeter.

Nice, friendly people. I can't say if it was fast work as I'd never had an engine replaced by professionals before. My truck runs great now and that is all that matters. They will give you a ride home or pick you up if needed. The key for my truck was out of stock so I had to go back. That time I made use of their waiting room for an hour. They have a TV and Coffee (Keurig)</Review>

Horrible experience: I wouldn’t buy a used car from these guys again. They told me they would fix the problems that I found while test driving the car. They said that the problems would be fixed before I took the car off the lot when I came to pickup the car. I paid for the car in full and took the car off the lot later. The problems came back and were not  taken care of. I called to complain and they said “sorry, as-is sale, it’s yours now, haha”. I guess I get to spend more money on getting the problems fixed myself. Super sad.< /text>

Took vehicle in under warranty and the mechanic didn't re-time the engine correctly. They kept fighting saying we need to keep driving the car and ended up finally listening to us and took the car in to inspect it. They said nothing was wrong and for us to keep driving to have the computer relearn the work done. After driving more and the car almost dying multiple times they re did their steps and found they didn't place the timing belt on the right tooth. So now we had the car running bad for a couple weeks and they seemed to not care about the incident. Maybe they will listen to the customer more often.<//text>

I had my 2008 F-150 serviced here. The problem was in the transmission and the recommended fix was a new transmission. This was no surprise to me since I'm very well-versed in the mechanics of vehicles and had already determined that myself. I just needed an approved shop to do the work in order for my warranty to cover the expense.

Monarch did not disappoint. I didn't lead on that I already knew what was wrong, I just let them do their thing. They did not try to lead me on at all. They communicated clearly and didn't hide any details. Any time the 'ball was in their court' during the warranty process, they worked very quickly; much faster than I anticipated. The process was effortless and painless.

If my vehicles require any work that I cannot complete myself, for whatever reason, Monarch will be my first call.

I think it goes without saying, but I will anyways, I am very VERY pleased with the customer service I received from Monarch's Service Department. Hopefully I get to purchase a vehicle from them sometime in the near future, once this truck is paid off.< /text>

My 2017 Ford broke down while traveling through California this past July 2018....yes I am slow at writing reviews.  However, Monarch Ford was not slow, they worked quickly and tried to meet our needs so that we did not miss any part of our vacation while they fixed our Ford.  Thank you to Glen Weaver, the service manager and all that work for him.  They are amazing and do great work, and yes I had even called other Ford dealerships in the area, but Monarch Ford was the only one who was able to fit our car repair into their service department.  Again, THANK YOU!!!!</Text>

We purchased our vehicle from Monarch Ford in Exeter and received great service from the sales department. From there we continued to take our vehicle to their shop for general maintenance and recall issues. We are very happy with the service they provide and have always received excellent customer service from their staff.< /Review>

While the purchase process was fairly fast and easy, I encountered other issues with this business. There were several defects with the truck that had not been fixed prior to the purchase. I was promised they would be fixed promptly as I signed the documents. I also discovered several other issues and reported these issues to the salesman as soon as I left the dealership. He promised he would deal with the issues along with those he already promised to fix. Took the truck back into the dealership and they refused to fix the other items I had reported. I spoke with the salesman and he refused to honor the agreement because I was no longer on the premises when I reported them. He also said they don't inspect the details of the trucks sold based on it takes too much time and they have a high turn over of volume. I would never purchase another vehicle from this dealership. They are dishonest and do not honor agreements. Be careful before shopping here.<//Text>< Time>

See edit below!!
This is the last time I will ever buy a car from Monarch Ford. They told my husband that they would fix the ac before we bought the car. They didnt... so now the car is stuck in the shop and I cant get it back. They dont know when they can fix it. They dont know the info for my extended warranty. They dont know if they will be comping the service fee. So in the meantime, I'm stuck without a car for who knows how long.
Update:
Terrible customer service. Terrible service department.. terrible sales.. Not only did they sell me a car that they said they repaired (husband noticed issues during test drive), but sold me a near useless extended warranty. I say near useless bc within the first year,, the transmission went out,, so at least that got fixed, after 30 days in the shop..
Every time I take it in, they have some excuse why they can't solve my other issues.
I even took it in on an insurance claim and they kept my car 30 days without even writing up an estimate. One of the big wigs, Glenn, even blamed ME for not having him handle the situation at the first sign of something being wrong. They supposedly worked on the car for 69 hours, but every time I asked what they did, they gave me the run around.
Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. Canceling my warranty bc its not worth the paper it's written on.
Currently dealing with 3 different shops to take care of the work that monarch couldn't handle. Oh... but they offered me a free detail. I told them not to touch my car ever again.
Every time I asked to speak to the owner, my request was denied.<//Text>

I like to take my F350 to Monarch Ford for service because of the staff in the service department. She is always very professional, accommodating, and friendly. I always feel confident with leaving my vehicle there because of her.<//Text>

<text>We purchased a brand new car here last week, got it home and noticed a rattling noise. Turns out the muffler was damaged and a bracket was missing making it rattle.  They also scratched the back of my car when they installed the paper dealer plates. I returned the car and they fixed the scratches, installed a bracket on the muffler but have said they will not replace the muffler, and while they had it to fix this stuff left a PEN mark on the leather center console. I have 4 children who have treated my car better than the service department at Monarch Ford. We will be taking our car elsewhere to have the damage fixed that Monarch Ford caused. Everytime they touch my new car they damage it further. We will not be purchasing anything else from this dealership from here forward and we will not be taking our car for services or any work at all. I was so pleased with the sales portion but this has been a disaster since we drove it off the lot. Shame on you Monarch Ford.</text><Name>Julia Thompson<//Name>< Rate>

< Review>
Just bought our fifth Ford at Monarch Ford in Exeter we were treated very well and got a great deal. Had the first oil change last week and all went well. The first oil change was almost  free so that was a pleasant surprise. Just had one of my customers tell me they just bought a Ford Edge at Monarch Ford for $1000 less than any other local dealer .<//Review>

Drove here from out of town and I am Extremely disappointed the dealer didn’t even bother to attempt to make a sale when I offered to pay in cash for a new vehicle the salesman was sarcastic almost like I was a liar and they made it seem like they didn’t want my business, they have almost zero selection of vehicles to choose from.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I really feel that this place overcharges. They don't have prices on anything, example the last time i went i bought 2lbs of meat which was $5.73 let's round it up to $6, $2 worth of limes 5 limes for $1 i grabbed 10 and 1 avocado for .99 cents and 4 tomatoes my total was $15 so you are telling me i paid $6 for those 4 tomatoes??? The meat weighted more than the tomatoes.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmaZGd4wds50f2bBI5rGXCBc-LRV8npG31AaKS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Always enjoy stopping here when I happen to find myself in Newman. Don't be fooled by the nonchalance of this place, the food is amazing and fresh. Try the pastor quesadilla with everything, you will not be disappointed.<//text>

Family owned, great service (the morning gentleman always greets and smiles at you when you walk into the market). You can place your meat order and will have it prepared for you to pick up. The food is great and on weekends the Menudo goes fast, so get there early.</Text>

Great cuts of meat at good prices, as well as snacks and some dairy. The people who work here are very nice, and care about the quality of their goods. It suffers from some cleanliness problems, though.< /text>

Everytime I go there the skinny guy the one that is always there in the meat section I think hector is his name has a nasty additude and besides that if he wants he sells if not he says he is out of what ever I need I have confirmed 100% that!! And the women from the kitchen always have a face and an attitude that seems like they don't want to sell and all of them they never give you a smile when serving or they are never polite with a thank you or you are welcome nothing always seem to be mad!!!I am soooo happy we now have more options with the other newman food center now I always shop there service is GREAT everybody is so much nicer in there i've been treated with so much respect I just love shopping there!!! And every time I go shop at newman food center I see more and more customers that used to go to carniceria dos aguas and they all say the same thing I do I feel happy for this newman food center they deserve to grow more they Know how to treat people with sooo much respect and the prices are better too! thank you newman food center!!! Carniceria dos aguas you guys should consider the service attitude you guys have with customers!!!!!</review>

<text>This was the only laundromat that had available washers and dryers! But it's one of my faves when I have to use a laundromat. Seems to be under new ownership /management since they were there cleaning and managing. The crowd is mostly Hispanic  (I am too so don't hate!) nowadays and there was no shortage of drama! There's a couple of 6 load washers, 4 loads and singles..and plenty of people to fight over them!< /text></record>

We finally had time to do our laundry near closing time, past the last wash. The owner was on sight and very helpful and friendly, she helped us pick the appropriate washers and dryers to get all our laundry done. The laundromat was the cleanest and bright and she was so nice. Thank you for being so kind and making us feel welcomed, like family, even past hours of operation. Next vacation you will be seeing us again.thanks again, Alvaro and Sheri

<review>This laundry facility is one of the cleanest I've ever been in, I notice the owner ( who is also very nice ) cleaning when I;m in there and taking ANY concerns very seriously with care. There's a fun little coin game you can play in there if someone isn't already playing. I come here every time I need to do laundry. The place across the street got shut down and lately there has been an influx in new customers who are kinda rude and act like they own the place, So if you see these people just ignore them! I will remain a happy customer.<//review><Name>Tyler Hull</Name></record>

<text>I like this place. I was going to Warner coin laundry forever. I went there today, and half their single load washers were broken , so I came here. Clean, quiet and working machines!  I found a new home to do laundry . Thank you Surf City  Laundromat!<//text>< Time>

The woman who works here is fantastic. She let me do laundry even after the cut off time and didn't chase me out. She just asked if I could find at home. Way cool. Also the prices are good. Dryers are $0.25 for 9 minutes and they have single load through 6 load machines. And they're always clean. Seriously. CLEAN. As I write this the woman who runs this place is wiping out the machines by hand.</Text>

I always thought this laundromat was old and dingy , it is in desperate need of an update to this century . We are 20 years into the 21st century and it looks like the last time this place was remodeled was 20 yrs before the 21st century started< /Review>

My experience at empire Nissan was the best experience I’ve ever had at a dealership. They have an amazing team at this store and I will never go anywhere else! My sales advisor manar is the absolute best along with Jimmy and the whole finance team. They really made me feel like family which made the buying process not feel like a headache but actually enjoyable. Thank you empire Nissan and to the wonderful GM who knows how to pick the best team! You guys rock!<//text>

I have taken my car here for a few routine maintenances and the staff from the front desk as well as the guys in the shop have been extremely helpful and quick. No complaints at all and would definitely recommend taking your car here<//Review>

<time>1619059224121<//time><Review>I have been going to Empire Nissan for service since the purchase of my 2015 Nissan Altima. I was sad to hear that Joe Avila was no longer working there on my last visit. Kevin greeted me and immediately assumed responsibility of my vehicle and gave exceptional customer service. Once the service was completed, I was happy to hear that I had accumulated reward points that covered the cost of the service done. Desire the cashier was very welcoming and her customer service met my expectations. Glad to see smiling faces during difficult times in society.< /Review>< Rating>

Whenever I come back to Empire Nissan they always take care of me and update me with everything my car needs. I sincerely recommend shopping here for your new car. If you plan on purchasing a new car I advise you to talk to Eduardo Martinez. He is by hands down one of the best car dealer associates I’ve ever met. He does not hassle you around, he lets you shop around, he is very patient and answers all of your questions.<//review>

Brought my vehicle in for maintenance and to service my power window.  Met with Cesar in the Service Department.  He was very helpful and considerate with keeping me informed with the progress of my vehicle.  I would definitely bring my vehicle back for service and would recommend considering Empire Nissan first when servicing your vehicle.</Text>

Had a great experience with Oscar in service. Took a vehicle in for repair he was very communicating through the repair process. The vehicle was done right when he said I did not have to call him once. It’s rare to have a service writer with this type of communication so I appreciate Oscar for that< /text>

Horrible service. I had an appointment at 7:30am, to which I arrived early at about 7:15-7:20am.
I was advised my service (brake change etc) would take approximately 2 hours. I was supposed to be done at 9:30am, it was now 10am with no update. After having to ask someone at the register to check on my service, they told me it would be another 30 mins. I did not leave until 11am!! HORRIBLE SERVICE.

What was even the point of making an appointment if they were just going to work on everyone else before you?

<Text>I am leaving a full 5 stars because of two people and that is Javier and Jay. If it wasn’t for them I probably wouldn’t rate the full 5 stars but 4. My family has been with Empire for yeaaaaaars so I have very high expectations. I only say that because from the moment I started coming here with my own car I've had to hunt down a service advisor. Some are kinda blind and don’t acknowledge your car..  until I met Javier he has been by far the quickest/welcoming advisor. I went to another advisor when I first bought my car but his attitude was not so welcoming so I really wish I could say the same about others but so far Javier has been the most reliable and caring when I’m having issues! He’s done so well.  He’s attentive to everything you tell him. I personally have had to bring my car a couple times because of minor stuff and he’s always managed to take care of it even when he’s really busy, he never says no.  I highly recommend him 100 percent if you want your car to be in good hands and cared for after you buy. Thank you Javi for all your care. Also thank you to Jay and the management staff for welcoming me to Empire Nissan and treating my family so well over the past years! I hope it stays this way. Overall I am very happy with this place but please make sure you acknowledge your customers when it comes to the service area even just asking if they’ve been helped you never know if you’re dealing with a long term loyal customer. 😉</Text>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I had an extremely positive new car buying experience with Empire Nissan. So much so that I was compelled to write my first-ever Google review!  This was by far my best traditional dealership experience. I would recommend Empire Nissan to any friend looking to purchase a new car.

I mainly interacted with Pervez Wasi and Ruel Bandoja, both of whom were very professional and pleasant.

Wasi provided me with a very competitive price through the Costco Auto Program over email. Other dealers were unable to match it. He also emailed me the out the door price! It was great to have the information ahead of time because I was able to come in and buy the car without any unpleasant surprises (more on that later). Ruel walked me through signing the purchase documents and made sure I was comfortable in my new car before driving home.

The process was very refreshingly straightforward and pleasant. The car I purchased was free of unwanted dealer add-ons and contained only upgrades that were directly from Nissan. There was also no pressure at all to purchase additional warranties or other add ons.

Having experienced these tactics at other dealerships, I can attest that buying from Empire Nissan is great for both your wallet and stress level!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I want highly appreciate sherif Hamad, he is extremely exceptional. I walked in the other day to purchase my very first car and couldn’t be more please with the welcoming I got from this young man. To say the least thanks to him and his hard working ability, that I was able to drive out with my new Nissan Sentra 2020. This place is wonderful, the whole staff is amazing also a special thanks to Adam as well. The whole team you guys are great!!< /Review>

Empire Nissan gave me a great deal on my Rogue. They have taken very good care of me since!  Because of that, when my Rogue wouldn’t start, we had it towed to Empire Nissan, right past Metro Nissan.  Thank you Gary & Christina!!</Review>

3 years ago I got a lease Nissan Sentra from this location and as my understanding the car was going to be under 2 people my dad's name and my name. When is was time to purchase my lease I was notify that my name was not on the lease. I never realize that my name was not on the lease. When the sales person that I wont not mention run my credit told me that I did not qualify that I needed a co signer. I had an appointment to purchase a new car but the second time he run my credit he called me to tell me that my credit was flagged and he needed a picture of my social security card. He wanted me to send a picture a number. I did not send anything, he called me again to asked for the picture. Over all the customer service is not the best, I had to called different people to get the information that I need to return my lease. I went to Honda and I qualify without a co signer. Not happy with their service.</Text>

I had service done on my Nissan Maxima and at first I wasn't too happy on the price of my service but after talking to my service specialist I had the cost of my service explained and he understood my concerns and took care of them. They do take care of their customers even if something is wrong. All it takes is some communication. I am definitely coming back for service and recommend Empire Nissan to my friends and family.<//Text>

This is hands down the best Nissan dealership I’ve ever been to.  I recently visited in 8/13/20 to have a transmission fluid change completed.  I was quoted 300-400 at other Nissan dealerships which I though was excessive to say the least.  Ontario Nissan had a special for $149.99 so I scheduled an appointment and they got me in that same day.  They said it’d be ready in 2 hours and to my surprise it was ready in exactly 2 hours which was awesome.  When I’ve been to other Nissan dealerships they say 2 hours and that turns into 3-4 hours but not at Ontario.  My service advisor Javier was very friendly and helpful.  It’s rare to find great customer service nowadays, Javiers customer service was excellent and I will definitely be returning to this dealership for all my service needs.  I live in corona about 15 miles away but I’ll drive the extra distance to come here from now on because of their great customer service and fair prices.<//Review>

The straightforward approach to to car sales was refreshing. No overpriced dealer installed add ons put in their vehicles, and all options including extended warranty options have their prices listed on Empire Nissan’s website. Ruel was the most honest salesperson I have ever dealt with, the price I was quoted was the price I paid with zero pressure to add any product or services to the deal.<//Review>

couple days a go me and my daughter went to look for a car for her, and i just wanted to say, that since the moment we got there, Juan Garcia and general manager John made us feel like we were the most important people for them, they took the time to listen for our need, and they help us on getting the best deal in our New Nissan Sentra 2020. I loved they spirit of kindness and humble people. if you are thinking on buy a new car, I really recommend you to go to Empire Nissan and ask for Juan Garcia. They are the number one on customer satisfaction. Blessings!<//Text>

I took my car in to have an oil change and to find  out why the service engine  light  was on.  Was there for approximately 2.5 hours.  I was never contacted by a mechanic on why the service engine light was on.  It  did say on the  invoice that I needed a new swirl control valve.  Gary brought this to my attention, while I was  picking  up my  car.

In addition on the invoice it states Customer DECLINED manufacturer recall on the airbag - this was NEVER  brought to my attention ( although I was aware of the recall) - and I never DECLINED the service.  I wouldn't  have time to  get the service done that day, but I never DECLINED or was asked about the service.<//Text>

Excellent experience every time with the sales & service team.  I purchased my Altima there in 2016 and bought a Pathfinder in 2018 at a different dealership because it was closer to home but regret not purchasing through Empire Nissan.  Luckily I have both cars serviced at empire Nissan and they're friendly,  professional and above all always on the up and up & I don't feel like I'm being oversold on services.  I appreciate their fast repair time,  prices and most of all their staff.  I recommend visiting this dealership even if it's a drive because the service is worth it.< /text>

and in a timely manner, never had any issues,  I live about 30 miles from the dealer, and their are closer Nissan dealers, but I have had HORRIBLE issues with Corona Nissan, but every time I go to Ontario Nissan it's been an absolute pleasure!!!!

I just want to say our family has bought many vehicles here and I was not really looking for a new truck. Dave Qy basically made a great deal and was straight forward from the time we talked. With everything going on I got the deal done over the phone and got upgraded from my previous titan! Flawless and efficient with no haggle the price was the price and everything I asked for was granted. Eddie offered to wash and put gas in my truck when I brought it back to put my tow package on the vehicle which came 1 week after I got my tuck 5/14/20! I am pleased and happy with Empire Nissan they have my business for life!< /review>

I asked to have my tires rotated and they weren't. So I need to return and get that done. I've moved from Raleigh NC, and had exceptionally good service there. Always had my alignment checked and tires rotated with every oil change. I asked for it and didn't get it addressed.
In the past 7 yrs, I have purchased many Nissan's for my family.< /review>

<Name>Robyn Holt<//Name><time>1605375377136<//time><rate>5</rate>< review>
First time buying a used car from a dealer, and Empire Nissan treated my sister and I Iike we bought a new car. The process was quick and painless, Wasi and the guys accepted my "much" lower offer and threw in 3 years of oil service just to be nice! Our car was washed, filled with gas and Wasi paired the boothtooth and made sure we were safe and ready to go before pulling off the lot. Great service would recommend and buy again from this dealer, thank you!<//review>

Where do I start... I've had several problems with my 2017 Maxima. What puts the cherry on top is this last time my problem was supposed to be fixed, my engine light came on the very next day. When I spoke the the service manager Jerry, he was VERY unprofessional. He told me "Just bring it back..." Like I said before, I've had several problems since I bought the. Jerry says they have been having ALOT of problems with 'THE NISSAN MAXIMA." He told me this time just leave it so we can figure out what is wrong with it. I left it and the same day they were done with it. Still not fixed. He says "there is about 500 things that could be wrong with the evap system!" "It can take 3, 4 or 5 times you bring it back until it will get fixed!" Wow ok so I have to keep taking my time out of work to JUST BRING IT BACK to get fixed! So very upset!</text>

<Review>I really love my 2017 Rogue and Empire Nissan has taken care of me.

But you need to stay on top of them.
**They "do" a several "Point" check of your car, for free, but then do not tell you the results!  I even mentioned my struts when dropping the car off and was informed they would look at them.
**If you wait for your vehicle, listen carefully, they only call your name once and not loudly.  I had my Rogue in for oil change and rotation of tires.  In their computer they had it under John, I'm Mary.  My 3 kids and I sat there for several hours.  They never called my name, which they should have entered for that day.  I had to go ask about it.  Sending a text to the owner that is sitting in the lounge or maybe was dropped off at work, that their vehicle is ready would be a fantastic feature!

Empire Nissan sales team is wonderful.  Service has room to improve.  The ball is in your court Empire Nissan!<//Review>< Resp>

I have done business with Empire Nissan since 2014 as I purchased my first vehicle. Since then I’ve purchased an additional vehicle and referred  my brother to purchase one as well. Wasi has been just excellent. In addition to the purchasing department, I only complete my maintenance at the dealership. Oscar, Jonathan and Christina in the service department are always a pleasure to work with. They go above and beyond to ensure my vehicle is running at its best.< /Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80c34aa0cff756fb:0xf665e2421214d023<//Gmap_id><text>This review is mostly for the service department, but the sales men are friendly, aren't to pushy and will give you space. Anyway, I usually bring my car to Empire Nissan for things I can't fix or would rather have them do... for example a CVT drain and fill or in this case I had code p0101. I made an appointment over the phone and came in the next day. I was dealing with Javier and told him the code and other symptoms I was having. Javier was a pleasure to deal with and took care of me quickly. My car was taken in and they fixed the p0101, with a throttle body cleaning and reprograming. And it was all covered by warranty,  which I thought I had run out of. But it wasnt all good news because come to find out I had a permanent code that they code not clear due to an issue with the transmission which explains the surge/vibration I was feeling. Javier also got this taken care of a few days later. Big thank you to Javier, and to Oscar for helping me out on my second visit. You guys are awesome.<//text><date>1597003072933< /date></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Empire Nissan is the Very Best Nissan Dealership.
The staff in the Service Dept are Friendly and Professional.
My contact there is Joe Avila, where he goes beyond to take care of any issues required.
He makes our family feel that we're in great hands with Empire Nissan.
I've been a customer of Empire Nissan for over 15 yrs and I wont go elsewhere.
I Highly Recommend Empire Nissan based off my personal  experience.<//Review>

<text>I absolutely recommend this dealership.  We originally went to Moss Brothers because they told us that they would give us 1500 to 2000 off of the used vehicle we were looking at.  When we went there, the vehicle had significant rear end damage and they reneged on their price cut.  On top of that they tried to add a few thousand dollars in dealership fees.  We left and went to Empire Nissan.  We only dealt with the internet manager Wasi.  The vehicle was in great shape and he didn't try to upsell us on anything.  He didn't add any extra fees (just the normal tax, title fees).  We didn't feel that we were getting swindled and absolutely felt respected.  I would go here again.< /text>< Response>

We have NEVER had a better experience purchasing a car than we did with Empire Nissan. The transaction was more than fair, the service was ABOVE AND BEYOND thanks to John Fakhoury, Valerie Romero, and Adel Rizk. Any way they could make it easy on us, they did! They drove the contract and car right to us, quickly changed the contract when we decided to change up the financing component, and truly made us feel like royalty! Couldn't be better! We will be lifelong clients. Thank you Empire Nissan! Just WOW!< /text>

<text>Came in to see if they had any good deals on cars. We were assisted by June. Definitely a great experience. He was super patient and had gave us several options that actually fit our needs. The numbers were perfect but he not had to run everything through his manager. I thought "Here we go!" He introduces us to Adam.
Adam was great to work with. I went in guys office "Ready to negotiate and would not deviate from my offer!" Well, there was no need for all that. Adam low balled me on the price I wanted to offer by a good amount and gave us an amazing interest rate. Did not expect what we got for the amount that was paid. 2020 Nissan Versa at a 2018 price!<//text>< pics>

Jonathan did a great job helping me. My expectations were surpassed because he sent me text and email information about the free vehicle inspection performed by the technician. In the past that information was provided on a hard copy, but I think it is a great idea to save paper. Thanks again, Jonathan. Great job!< /text>

< Review>
Empire Nissan will attempt to waste your time then rip you off on your trade in. This dealer printed out a KBB trade in value sheet and tried to offer me $1700 less than printed value. I kept the sheets to remind me to stay away in the future.  What a joke of a dealership. Stay away!</Review>

the service at empire nissan is great. All the people are very nice and welcoming. The   problem I have is with the product itself. Never in my life have I ever own a car or heard of anyone owning a car that the transmission fails before the factory brakes need to changed. I'm sorry that will never be purchasing a Nissan product its not the peoples fault it is corporate or engineering for making an inferior product.<//Text>

Richard is the best service advisor I’ve ever had... Toyota, Honda, and independent shops pale in comparison to the service I’ve received from Richard.  He doesn’t try and oversell, and works with my budget to prioritize the services/parts I do.  Nearly 200k miles on my 2013 Altima and 70k on my 2017 Armada... We drive a lot and depend on our cars, and Richard makes sure they don’t break down on us (without breaking the bank).  Thank you Richard!<//text>

So to start of I had an amazing experience at Empire Nissan . I am a first time buyer I got lucky to have Dave Ky as my salesman we first spoke over the phone, He understood I had my eyes on a certain used car and asked me to come in the afternoon to talk numbers . When I arrived Dave let me know what he came up with after running the numbers an then asked me if I'd be interested in a brand new car, we walked out to the lot to take a look . Any question I had about a car Dave gave me an answer . I ended up leaving with a brand new car thanks to Dave and all his help . After our experience we feel anytime we have a question or if a issue comes up we can always contact Dave . I just want to thank Dave for all his help with the full experience of buying my first car !<//text>

This is my first car and they made sure to give my parents the best deal that they could afford but also made sure that I received a car with lots of safety features.  This is the second car my parents have purchased from Empire, they will definitely purchase a car from them again.<//review>

Dave told me to come in next morning and he felt that he could beat the price with a much nicer car.
We drove down sunday morning and he looked at our trade went in and worked us up a price. Gave us some time and we bought the car. I saved over 600 dollars and bought a car that was 3000 dollars higher sticker price. Once we agreed on the price the paper work too about 45 min start to finish and we were driving to go get lunch on our way home.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1574275698146, 'text': "Thanks for the positive feedback, Warren.

John, General Manager, is amazing! I buy my cars from Empire because of John. Respectful, Knowledgable, a man of true Character! Also Jerry, Service Manager, is a wonderful man. I’m always met with a smile and called by name. He is beyond accommodation to my every need. From the minute I walked onto the lot to the minute I drove home, exceptional experience. I will only be buying cars from Nissan Empire. No one else, when you have two brilliant people caring for you, you stay with those brilliant people. I would be a fool to not return to Empire for my every Nissan need. Forth Nissan purchased by-the-way. Sentra and Quest sit in my driveway. We are a devout Empire Nissan Family!<//review>

I'm very glad I chose Empire Nissan to purchase my new Titan Platinum.  Jeff was absolutely amazing and very knowledgeable salesperson.  He really knows how to take good care of his customers and this was the main reason why I chose Empire.  The staff are very nice and the buying process was very easy.  Signing was extremely quick and hassle free.  Thanks again Jeff for the remarkable experience I had at Empire Nissan.  I will return again on my next Nissan purchase, perhaps the GTR.< /review>

Leased a Nissan Leaf from Empire.  Great experience.  Provided me the numbers via txt as a I shopped around.  All the paperwork was filled out ahead of time.  Came in to sign it and was in-out in less than a hour.  Most pleasant experience in a dealership.  Worked with Dave Ky.  Was extremely knowledge about the Leaf and didn't try to sell me more than what I wanted.<//text>

<review>SAL & NESTOR were A1!!!!!!!!!!
From beginning to end, very PROFESSIONAL, very HONEST, and very RESPECTFUL.... My family was put in a difficult situation currently dealing with transportation & SAL was recommended to us. SAL & NESTOR took good care of us & even though our current situation was tuff ,they left us with options!!👍🏿.
FYI: We recently relocated here from the south and we bought a brand new vehicle before moving here from a dealership we have alot of respect for because their process is smooth as well. The last vehicle we bought ,it took about 4hrs total. Which is not bad. SAL & NESTOR HAD US PULLING OFF IN 3.5HRS, not bad at all to say we had a few bumps in the road. THANK YOU GUYS. ME & MY FAMILY APPRECIATE IT.< /review>< userid>

I JUST HAD THE BEST CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE with SAM LEE!  He was completely friendly, honest and upfront, from beginning to end.  He made sure I understood the whole process and everything about the Altima.  Even took the time to entertained my rowdy kids!  Sam Lee will be my main contact anytime I or anyone I know needs a car.  YOU SHOULD ASK FOR SAM LEE FOR YOUR NEXT CAR PURCHASE, I will :)< /Review>

The purchase of my Titan XD was one of the most professional and structured experiences I’ve had when purchasing a vehicle. From the sales staff to the financing department the knowledge and professionalism far exceeded my expectation. I can’t say enough about the staff at Empire Nissan other than they will have a customer for years to come.<//review>

<Date>1490922862093<//Date><rate>5</rate><Review>Came here to purchase a 2017 Altima,ended up getting a super black midnight edition. Noticed a couple scratches before leaving the dealer we got it fixed with the detailing department. Well when I got home in direct sunlight the scratches and swirl marks were more noticeable. I had an appointment with the tint department Wednesday morning decided to make another appointment for the detailing department to get rid of the scratches that were there already. Well after a few hours of waiting for both services to be done my car is covered in even more noticeable scratches and swirl markings all over the hood. As mad as I was my husband and I left the dealer extremely upset not wanting to deal with anyone. When we got home we decided to call sales department and a couple other reps of Empire Nissan. We came upon a nice lady named Irma who helped us with the frustrations we had. She managed to speak to the general manager about our situation and both went that extra mile to help and get our issues resolved. After all I'm satisfied with the care and interest they have for their customers satisfaction. Definitely referring my friends and family here.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPR0vSF_0QjZxaLGoG7yOA-EuVum4p5-7p8O7GV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I’ve been a loyal Nissan customer for the last 8 years. I’ve always taken my vehicle to Nissan metro in Montclair.  Recently I’ve made an effort to look  for service that is affordable and genuine. After talking to my service advisor at Empire Nissan, I made the choice to take my vehicle in for service. As promised by the service advisor I received Great service on my vehicle and got a really good price. Both are important and Was what any customer looks for. I definitely will share my experience with fellow Nissan owners and will return for my next service appointment.<//Text>< Pictures>

EXCELLENT SERVICE! Sidney was AMAZING! He worked with me for months pricing different vehicles, working on different deals and being extremely patient while the purchase of my new home was waiting to close. He literally did everything he could to get me into the car I wanted at the payment I wanted. He stayed in constant contact with me, updating me with all the information every step of the way.

I am extremely happy with my new Rogue Sport and will be forever a Nissan customer because of Sidney!<//Review>

5 stars doesn’t even begin to justify the amazing experience I’ve had with John and his salesman, Manny. We got a very nice 2019 Sentra, Rogue, and a Titian with gap and warranty for a very responsible price. The entire buying experience was outstanding, customer service hands down the best. I recommend this car dealership to everyone (see John or Manny for your needs).< /Text>

This dealership (Empire Nissan) was top notch! Ruel Bandoja went above and beyond to make sure I purchased the right car for me and most comfortable with. He gave me suggestions and his advice, but was in no way pushy what-so-ever. After I decided on a car the process was absolutely painless. So quick and professional. I felt like family by the end of the whole process! I would recommend Ruel Bandoja to anyone who is looking for a new or used vehicle.</review>

I was taken care of by sales person Eduardo Martinez on my new 2020 Maxima. He is a wonderful sales person and made sure I had a great buying experience. Sales manager Jay Holley was also very attentive to my needs and made sure I got the payment I needed. Everyone there was very nice!! I was also lucky to meet the General Manager John Fakhoury who came over and introduced himself and asked if there was anything else they could do for me! Just AMAZING COURTEUOS SERVICE!!! I will be back and send everyone I know here!! Thanks guys!!</review>

He has arrange for vehicles to be delivered to my house so I never have to set foot in the dealership.  They are great.< /Review>< pics>

Overall a very positive experience. Salesman Gerardo (bilingual: English/Spanish) was patient and courteous, Even after test driving 4 vehicles. We never felt rushed.
We came in looking for a new car for my mom, after visiting Crown Toyota and being ditched by the sales man, we headed over to Empire Nissan. After test driving 4 different cars she finally settled on the new 2019 Nissan Rogue sport. Gerardo went above and beyond to make sure mom got everything she wanted in her new car!
Thanks Gerardo!!</text>

Sam Lee is the best!  He is a complete professional.  I was extremely difficult but Sam was patient, open and honest from beginning to end.  Sam Lee took the time to find out my needs and found the prefect car for me.  Every step was explained before we took it.  Even after I bought the car Sam would call to check in with me to see if I had any questions or problems.  If you want the best deal with great service make sure you ask for SAM LEE the INTERNET MANAGER!< /review>

Engine light was on, just had car sensor fixed 4 months ago. Place was busy and service guy came by to say it was going to take an hour before our car would be hooked up to have. It diagnose. Anyway we told the guy it was ok and we would wait. About an hour and half goes by I get a call on my phone service guy is on the line not only as he forget that I was waiting  also at no time he came to explain to me personally what was wrong with my car. I am so upset with the service that was given today.< /review>

I have always been very happy with the service provided by Empire Nissan. Unfortunately, when I had my 2009 Rogue serviced (oil change and new spark plugs), the oil change was not done correctly. I drove from the Empire Dealership to Lake Havasu City, AZ. The following day, I drove my mom to the drug store and discovered a large oil spill on the driveway. After running errands for my mom,  I took the car to the Lake Havasu City Nissan service dept. and found that the nut had not been tightened properly. Luckily, I still had enough oil, but the staff there had to clean the mess on my car, tighten the "crusher nut" properly, and check the oil level. I am lucky the nut did not come out as I drove across the desert.< /text>

I won't give this dealer a zero star because you can't.  Melissa Rodriguez is the worse person to deal with at this dealer.  The GM NEVER returns your phone calls.  He has the Sales Manager call for him.

NEVER BUY A CAR FROM THIS DEALER unless you want the worse possible experience ever with people that hang up on you and stall on doing their jobs.</Text>

In the last 16 years we have purchased four Nissan’s from Empire. We have no complaints whatsoever. Gary Worley, assistant service manager is awesome as is Joe Sartor, fleet manager.  Wouldn’t even consider going anywhere else even though there are 3 other Nissan dealer closer to our house.< /Text>

He was patient, professional and very knowledgeable. John the General Manager took the time out of his busy day to meet with both me and my husband to ensure that I was able to get the vehicle that I wanted. I would also like to thank Basel in the finance department for their hard work. I would recommend Empire Nissan to anyone for an exceptional experience with a dealership. I will continue to do business with Empire in the future.

GREAT SERVICE! I went looking for a car at the Mazda Dealership and was greeted right away and assisted me with my car shopping. Brian P. was very informative and helpful, he answered every question about the car, warranty, and etc. He went out of his way to help us out! Such a great experience! I love my new car Mazda 3 S grand touring! Thanks Guys!</review>

He was very patient and gave me a great deal and great price.  The paperwork was the part that I was afraid of but he helped me with it and the Internet Manager Edward Niebla showed us all of the special features that we did not know about.  He had the Versa delivered to our house too.  Please go see him first before you do anything.<//Text></record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>From the moment I arrived to the moment I went home, I received top notch Customer Service, received helpful assistance and was treated like family. Eid greeted me immediately as I started looking around at the Nissan Kicks. He started to tell me information about each style of Kicks going over the mileage, features, cost, and more. I was able to have all of my many questions  answered, seat in each style of Kicks and test drive the car, all within 30 minutes of my arrival.

When I went inside, to see what I qualified for, my impression of Empire Nissan got even better. Eid introduced me to Manor, to a Sales Manager (I cannot remember his name) and to Mr. Ali in finance.  All of these men were very kind and respectful when they talked to me. Every one of them was patient with me answering all my questions, thoroughly explaining the car buying process, insurance, down payment options, interest, apr rates, monthly payments.
This was critical to me as a First Time Buyer, that they were patient and thorough with me because I was very nervous and overwhelmed. Each person helped to ease my nerves and helped me to relax to make the best car buying experience.

Once all the finance and paperwork was completed I felt like family with the Empire Nissan staff. I felt very taken care from each person that helped in the process. At the end of my process Manor and Eid helped to deliver my new car to my house.

The next day I came back to pick up my spare key, owners manual, floor mats, provide insurance paper for the Kicks. Manor took time to explain everything about the owner manual, key, car technology in the car, locking/unlocking helped set up my phone bluetooth with the car. Eid and the Sales Manager came out and greeted me. Once we were finished, Manor stated I could call or come in if I had any additional questions about the car. I really felt taken care of by all the staff and felt like family. This is why I believed I felt top notch Customer Service.</review>< pictures>

He went out of his way for me by doing extra things that normal salespeople would not do. Even after the purchase he calls me weekly to see how everything is going with my new car and if there is anything I might need. If you are in the market for a new vehicle I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you go see him. There is just no need to go anywhere else. Thanks again Wasi for just doing what you do.</Review>< Pics>

< review>
I contacted Empire Nissan regarding an issue with my vehicle due the last service being done with them. I was referred to speak with Jerry Farris who is their Service Director and to my disbelief was extremely rude, disrespectful and lacked so much professionalism. This is a man that represents a large corporation I was shocked and dismayed by his attitude. When I tried to explain the issue he cut me off and stated "you left us a bad review before!" and literally screamed and gave me a lecture and said he couldn't help me. Because he was yelling and lacked professionalism I asked to speak with his manager to whom he said was John Fakhoury but then yelled stating he's at a wedding and doesn't want to speak to you because of your review. I then asked for corporates number to which he declined to give me saying they wouldn't care what I said. Of course at this point in time I was so upset I hung up the phone. Called back to give him another chance but he had the same unprofessional and disrespectful attitude and stated "John Fakhoury didn't want my services any more " and to not step foot in their dealership that i was unwanted and hung up on me. I am shocked by his behavior. I did contact corporate even though he said they wouldn't care about my complaint. I'm in so much dismay I'm lost for words. Please becareful when taking your car in for services and if you are unsatisfied have your husband, brother, son or some male call for you because it's so sad to know that a woman can be so disrespected by a man in authority.< /review>

<Text>1st: Who ever you have in charge of phones 7/25 @2:45 , really short brief and cuts you off as you try to be polite to say thank you like I bothered her with my call.
2nd: I ask for service department  SHE SENDS ME TO PARTS!!

3:Finally got service department and i want to say the person who was quite polite and waited for me to finish my question was Jerry or Garry ( apologies I was dealing with 3 kids at the same time of the call). He was very helpful and could give pointers to some of your employees about proper phone skills.

4th:The person that makes the first impression of YOUR  business will be reception and phone.... that extra second would have made a difference to let me appreciate her help. Doesn't matter how good someone looks , if they dont have the skills , you teach or replace . At the end of the day its business not trying to be friends...... from one business owner to another,  best of luck to you and your customer service.<//Text><user_id>101918121175700647847< /user_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures><time>1564092441515</time>< Rating>

<Text>I've been a life long Nissan owner.  Wasi sold me my very first vehicle at 18 , I'm now in my mid 50's we are still loyal to Nissan.  Having purchased many cars throughout the years. When purchasing, Wasi is my #1 go to man! Wasi,  has always found a way to get us qualified.
Even at not so good times,  he has never let us down.  He's very concerned and attentive to our needs and guides us. Into making a good, affordable decision.  I hope he never retires  because my daughter's are looking forward to also purchasing vehicles in the near future.  I would love for him to make that sale, Did I mention my grandfather also purchased his cars from him.  So yes this is a hardcore Empire Nissan family! Now with the service department, they have a great staff.  My #1 go to is Cesar Cardenas! He's always giving 100% taking the time to listen to my concerns and always with the best smile and knowledge.  I have never felt as I've been taken advantage of in all the years he's been employed there. I can confidently make that statement because I've been a customer since way before he started.  I always brag about my guys and Empire Nissan! I've always said, they can wrap my car with their logo any time they want!! Give Empire Nissan a try, ask for Wasi tell him I sent you!<//Text>< Pics>

Nissan Ontario, service representative Javier

Javier S. is an amazing service representative. As many drivers experience, I came into the service department complaining about an unexpected noise coming from my rear passenger tire. Not only did Javier's inspection quickly verify the cause of the noise, but he also emphasized the importance of proper and timely maintenance. With this much needed reminder, Javier worked with me while my car was serviced to create an outline of future scheduled maintenances. Thank you so much Javier for making the necessary time to assist me in determining a schedule of maintenances based on driving habits. If you're on the fence about getting your car service done at Ontario Nissan, give them a call and ask for Javier.<//review>

We've just purchased our second car from Empire Nissan and are totally satisfied.  The staff from Sales to Service are all excellent.  The general feel is relaxed from the moment that you walk onto the facility.  They are more than willing to work with you.  I highly recommend them and will definitely be returning for future purchases and service.</review>

Had talked to (4!) other dealerships and Empire's pricing was the lowest from the first time I received the quote. Their non-negotiated price is very competitive. Sales personnel are courteous and not pushy/aggressive. When I decided to buy from Empire, called the guy at 5pm and he just went to work right away. Notified me by 7pm that night and made sure I had the car I wanted the next day (they didn't have it in stock). Since I had come from out of town to buy from them, they acknowledge that by giving me free oil-changes and other discounts. Overall it was a good deal and a pleasant experience. Will recommend to anyone.< /Text>

<Review>This place is a very bad place to go to. Watch out for a salesman by the name Jose Garcia. He will do whatever he wants to do and under mind you. He has no care in the world for anybody at all. Bottom line he only looks out for himself. The shady things that he did to me to get my car taken from me. When he has no right to do at all. He should have been fired for what he did. I couldn’t believe that they allowed him to do what they did. Lucky that I didn’t sue him and this company for what they did. Plus, when they lied to me about everything they let me walk all the way home. The messed up part of a of this is that I forgot my wallet at home. Mind you that I live all the way in Azusa. So can you see how far that is for a man with a disability. I have a problem with my foot, so walking too long or far will bring a whole lot of pain. So for them to not help me out in any way was so messed up. Jose told me that it is not his problem and if they give me a ride it is only for 7 miles. But yet they have picked me up and dropped me off a couple of time. Not include family members they did the same for. Then you they want your money they will do whatever they need to do to get it once they get it then they are like forget you. So rude and I would not do business with people like this. No respect at all.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>I arrived at 7:30 am and was told that the car would be ready in an hour and half. Exactly at 9 am I was told the car was ready. Perfect. All of the people I encountered were just great. The cashier apologized because the part dept. was running a long run on the printer which interfered with the printing of my invoice. I appreciated that.

A few months ago, my husband worked with Sydney from Ontario Nissan and wanted to leave a glowing review. Sydney was the only Nissan salesman who would work with him when our Altima had unexpected engine issues. Sydney even got my husband to consider purchasing another Nissan when our first Altima turned out to be extremely unreliable. He provided the epitome of customer service including following up with my husband, providing multiple test drives and late night service, and working with him to provide a reasonable trade in price.

We highly recommend working with Sydney for an excellent sales experience.<//text>

The professional and friendly service provided by each member of Empire Nissan has resulted in us buying four (4) vehicles (we go nowhere else now) and multiple friends and family members have received the same truly exceptional customer service.  The friendly service commences during the sales process and continues with the Service Department.  Cesar Cardenas will go out of his way to take care of your car and answer any question.  Words are in adequate, when your ready to purchase a vehicle or need your Nissan serviced go experience Empire Nissan for yourself!< /review>

< Review>
The General Manager John Fakhoury is amazing.  He really went above and beyond for me making my car buying process easy and painless.  His team is wonderful too, everyone was so polite and really treated me with respect, they all made me feel like family.  Being a single mother and living on budget, I was not expecting to leave with a 2018 Nissan Sentra and I am beyond ecstatic (insert tears of joy here).  THANK YOU John and to your whole team for EVERYTHING!!!< /Review>

Go see Anthony Mendoza at Empire Nissan.  Make sure you ask for him.  He will help you if you want a New or Used Nissan.  He can even answer any questions you have before you arrive.<//Review>

I live 36 miles away from this location but the drive is all worth it.  All the staff are highly commendable especially Rowell and Jerome.  They made sure that me and family are well taken cared of.  I told them about the type of car I like, the current lease car I have, my current monthly payment and they did work only 'around and within' my existing payment range with a much better interest rate.  I have been to a different dealership location and this one tops it all.<//text>

<Text>Mr. Pervez Wasi has been helping my family and friends find the right vehicles at the best price for 30 years. My dad bought his firs car from Mr. Wasi in 1989 when I was 10. Every time we would go to the dealership for a service Mr. Wasi would always make sure I was entertained. I loved the popcorn too. Well I have grow up since then and now I take my son in to the dealership when I need service on my Sentra that Mr. Wasi sold me. We both love the popcorn. My dad passed away a few years back and I will continue the tradition with my son of going in to see Mr. Wasi. Absolute the best and most caring salesperson we have ever worked with.</Text><username>Jacob Smithfield<//username></record>

Don’t even come close to the sales men without money spilling from your pockets. I asked two simple yes or no questions. And in return I got a lecture on how I need to be older to talk to him and how I should stick to looking. He had a very condisending tone and truly made me feel as if I was a poor man living in the slums. I understand I am only 17, but I still deserve to be talked to like a human being because I may be a future customer and my family may be future customers. I thought since I had a 3 hours to kill waiting for mazda service it would be a good use of time to see if they have an sales because I was thinking of buying a new car, with the fact in mind that I was working.
Big mistake!!!!!
I have never felt so ashamed to ask a question in my life.

In addition to lecturing me for coming up to him when I “apologized for wasting his time,” he would not let me leave till he finished and told me to bring my father and then he’ll answer my questions.
I am truly appalled at the service and may have written Nissan off my list for the rest of my consumer life.</Text>

The salesman Paul really helped me find the car for me.  I had another deal on the table   however he helped me to really look at a Nissan.  I"m very happy with my new car.  Also, Ali the Finance guy was great.  I'd go back there to buy another car.<//Text>

<Text>I bring my 2014 Altima here for routine maintenance. One thing that I noticed is that they don't have an on site car wash facility, therefore they don't wash your car after a service. Since there isn't a car wash on site, I would think that they would partner with a local car wash and give out vouchers or coupons after a service.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c34aa0cff756fb:0xf665e2421214d023<//gmap_id><user>110677590511088105571</user>< Name>

I bought a great car, the wife is happy,but don't expect the finance department to be honest. Completely ripped me off on my trade in. Gave me about 1/3 of the blue book trade in value! I should have done my homework first and my smartphone was died while doing research at the dealership but shame on them for disguising themselves as a reputable dealer. I honestly feel disrespected. I guess you live and learn. Learn from my mistake!<//review>

Bought a new car here and overall a good experience. Everyone treats you really well.

Only two things I didn't like. One is we went through three different salesmen by the time everything was said and done and it was kinda confusing going back and forth between the final two salesmen and basically having to relay some information twice as one guy left and the other came back and other guy left and so on. Another thing is it took forever from start to finish and maybe I've just been lucky in the past but this is the longest its taken me to ever buy a car and this is my 5th time buying a car.

Bottom line is I probably would recommend this dealer to people and if I'm ever in the market for a Nissan again I would definitely consider this dealership.< /text>

Joe Avila always takes care of me. I called Joe and told him something was leaking. He said bring it on out. When I showed up Joe was at lunch but the Service Manager was there and said Joe will be back in about 20 minutes but I can help. He had a mechanic come out right away and take it to the service bay. They looked at it right away, showed me what was leaking, Joe was back from lunch by then, he ordered the parts and started work on it right away. The whole Service Team at Empire are Outstanding, they listen to you, understand what your needs are and go to action.
I won't take my car to any other place for service. Hats Off to ALL of you!< /text>

Will never return...
They have your car and you got to call them for updates on when they will be finish.

When you tell them what's going on with the car "is that all" like I'm wasting their time.

Please, stick it out with these guys, they try to get you into the cars they are trying to get rid of... and also make sure you check the value of the car you want... they will gladly let you pay more than the car is worth, (don't trust)... don't trust them to be fair to you...  please do your homework before going down to this place...</Text>

I have bought several cars before and never have experience the terrible customer service I got here. Not to mention they don't accept legal documents accepted everywhere else. Save yourself the headache and go anywhere else. Bunch of inadequate salesmen and management not worth anyone's business. So glad I pulled out of the deal with them.< /Review>

Oscar Armas in service is the only reason why my mom bought a car there. We had a 2013 Altima, and he was great taking care of our car.. and had great service with him. Now we have a 2018 Altima and wouldn't go anywhere else.</text>

So many problems! Not only are they rude. But they trick you into buying a car by offering you like free oil change. Even though you have the paper that shows proof that you where offered the free oil change no strings attached. They put restrictions and when you show that the paper you have says no strings attached they come up with other reasons why. Corporate was no help because they said it was the dealer who offered it not them. I have bought multiple cars from different dealer ships and this has been the worse experience I have had. They treat you like your below them I am never buying a Nissan vehicle ever. Shady people.< /text>

<user_name>Carissa Swan</user_name><Date>1453319956439< /Date><rate>1< /rate><Text>We called to compare the price of a 2016 camry. (we were quoted at 415 a month for 5 years), Nissan said, well beat that at 360! We were very excited and went to test drive. All doors were open and we were focused on interior of the car, it was very nice. We went ahead and started the paperwork. Here is where we realized that although 360 a month, they extended the contract by a whole year. (6 year contract) We weren't happy about the fact that they left that detail out, but decided to proceed anyways. (we did the math and there wasn't a huge price difference, and we had already invested most of our day here and had our credit application approved). The next day, we are filling out paperwork for our car insurance, and the vin did not run as a 2016, but a 2015! We looked over the contract, and sure enough, the one place the year of the car is specified, in tiny little red letters, reads 2015! We were misled from the beginning and paid a 2016 price for a 2015 car. NOT HAPPY. WILL NEVER GO THROUGH THIS DEALERSHIP AGAIN. Although it was our stupidity for not reading over every single , little part of the contract, I feel like we were deceived and manipulated. Although we like our car, we definitely overpaid and are not happy with the service received.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Absolutely LOVE how they are willing to work with you in a very pleasant and patient manner. Unlike other dealerships in the area, which I shall not name, that try to get you into an Accord AFTER you leave their lot! Oh........oops!
Anyhow, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to visit if you are looking to get a new Nissan.........
Thank you Cindy for all your help. You ROCK!!!!!!!
By the way..............I LOOOOOOOOVE my 2015 Altima!!!< /Review>

Went in to service my Nissan 350z and got nothing talked down to. My oil cap was lost and oil filter wasn’t put on tight enough. I no oil within 2 hours. If you don’t have money in your pockets they will send you to go kick rocks. Never in my life have i ever dealt with such a bad dealershit. Plus when u looked up my vin after buying my car from them the miles were rolled back and my title was rebuilt after they claimed “Clean”. Stay away !</review>

Sent my son for an oil change for a 2013 Nissan. He text me saying how expensive it was. I asked him how much. He said $90, but the guy gave him a $20 off coupon so $70! I said what??? That is way to expensive. I told my husband and we called the normal dealership we take car too. They let us know around how much it should have cost. Got the receipt from my son he was told he needed a new air filter he end up paying $98 and change for both. For What should have been $50. Then when my husband called  empire asked them how much it would be for an oil change he was told $29.95 then my husband and why my son was told $90 and guy said he got synthetic my husband then explained the guy asked my son what kind of oil he used and my son said idk and the guy pretend to look him up and said oh synthetic. My husband then advised the guy that Nissan doesn't even recommend synthetic for a Nissan sentra the guy said nothing. My husband then dealt with Jerry Advisor Manager who then cussed my husband out, said he should teach my son about cars refunded the money, said to never bring the car back to them. That they don't care about us our money they are to big for us small people. Really?! As you need us small people to rippe off to get a pay check!!!!< /Text>

<Time>1511320768861< /Time><review>Richard from the service department needs a promotion. You want that man at the head of your customer service because you can tell he’s got a real passion for it.

I️ first went in with a rear axel noise and after a speedy diagnostic, Richard invited me to come into the shop and actually see the gravity of the issue for myself. He went into great detail about the service needed and was very accommodating. The part took a little longer to arrive and Richard took care of the additional rental costs! He texted me pictures of the repair and kept me updated even on his off days.

I️ have returned a second time for another issue and he was just as fantastic.

Hands down the best service experience at a dealer I️ have ever had. If you’re looking for someone to really take care, just ask for Richard!< /review><rate>5</rate>< pictures>

Well I went for service yesterday and as usual they did a great job. While I was there I spoke to the General Manager John Fahqoury and he offered me such a great deal for my daughter to buy a new Altima I couldn't resist. So we went down there last night and they didn't have the color we wanted ,so while we waited they found the color at another dealer and went and got if for us and we took the car home. And all this only took less then a couple hours. Now that's what I called costumer and Dealer loyalty !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Wouldn't go anywhere else !!!< /Text>

<review>My mom at the age of 76 unfortunately was in a very bad car accident days after Christmas and her car was totaled. It was very stressful for my mom, who is very independent, to not have transportation. After working with brokers who said my mom could not afford a small suv and would have to downsize into something cheaper, I did not feel we were going to get her into a safe enough car with a higher clearance for good visibility. That is until meeting Eva and her team at Empire Nissan. They made the process so easy and effortless that we will never look anywhere else or work with anyone else ever again. I can say that because the team has been together there for many years. That has to tell you something about the dealership to have such good retention of their sales and finance team members. Feel safe about letting them know exactly what you can afford and trust them to get you in the best car for your money. Thank you again Eva, Henry, and Issa.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLj0MKbdwhDvpqUC6GSfnhDpNpF0cTcmVndVIU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

I know for a fact that this dealer will take care of you.  I have purchased 4 vehicles from them (Pathfinder, Armada, Titan and recently 2015 Sentra). Like any place of business you have to do your homework before you walk in.  It does not matter where you go, if you don't take the time to research the car you want you will be ripped off. The service department is the best.  I have had a couple of hiccups over the years, but they always take care of me because you develop a relationship with a service agent.  I am always getting oil changes at a ridicules price for all my cars. This last month my warranty just ran out when my Armada's transmission died. It took a couple of phone calls, but they replaced it with a new one ZERO out of pocket, over  $7,000.  These are the reasons why this dealer is the best...< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1422663663133, 'text': 'Lourdes, we appreciate your positive feedback, and we are certainly happy to have you as a loyal customer.

Always have my car serviced here. Always have an issue. Service employees tell you to give em 5 stars on survey and you'll  receive free services. Well after the transmission had to be replaced on my 2014 Versa after a lil over a year, they send me home with an empty gas tank(full when dropped off) and said everything had been taken care of. They never rotated my tires in the 30k miles I've had the car. Tires feel like new in the rear bald in front. When asked to speak to a manager (jerry)he said he would do nothing about it. Asked him for last name he said "his first was enough" WOW!! The will NEVER go back to this location and might not even visit a different Nissan!!! Planning on purchasing a new car in the summer. Don't think it'll be a Nissan!!!!!!!!<//Review>

The service department is SHADY!! I got lied to and charged $120 for a check engine light I could have gotten serviced for free elsewhere. I was never told I was going to be charged any amount until I picked up my truck and the guy called me a liar and just said "hey, we got your signature." SHADY<//text>

Bought a brand new Nissan Juke. Transition totally broke down before my first oil change. At first my husband I were livid both because my brand new car already had a major break down and secondly because of their customer service. However, After several weeks the situation was resolved. Unfortunately I had to keep the same car despite the major work. And even though it was out of Empire Nissan hands, they really stepped up their customer service and made the entire arbitration process as stress free as possible. Gary, one of the head mechanics, was awesome! Because of him I will continue to take my car to Empire Nissan.</Text>

This place is trash! The worst customer service ever in the service department. I left my 2013 Nissan Altima on at Saturday because the transmission went out, yes! Transmission problems already and it's only 3 years old. Well my car was at the service department for 7 days, did the work on it? Did they call me to give me update status? NO & NO they guy named Andrew lied.!!!!
I called on Saturday (7 days later) to check on my car they could give me any answers weather the car was fixed or not my husband had to go in and find out, which by the way the supposedly don't have any supervisors there on the weekends. BS. They told my husband they can help out with a rental but turns out they only help you by giving you a list of enterprises to go to so YOU can pay. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER BUY FROM NISSAN!!! WORST CARS EVER.
DONT BUY FROM THIS PLACE OR A CAR FROM THIS COMPANY.</text>

Took our car there for an engine replacement because of the good reviews.  We are so glad we did.  Service Manager Oscar Armas was amazing.  He found a good engine replacement which included a good warranty period.  He also worked with our extended warranty company and made sure cost stayed low on our end.  We picked up the car today and feel really good about our overall experience.  Much better than Infiniti Montclair who want to nickel and dime you , have bad service and offered a higher cost replacement engine with almost a non-existent warranty. Will not be going back there.  Will stick with Empire Nissan.< /review>

Terrible salesman skills just pushy. I don't reccomed to shop here even to browse. We had a budget and wanted to know out the door price they played games and tried to run our credit, all we wanted to know was the out the door price without being pushed and harrased about our budget. All they care about is making the sale which gives sales people bad name.

I recommend going to JOHN ELWAYS TOYOTA DEALER right around the corner best customer service ever! They give you out the door price immedentialy and let you walk out if you need to consider other options without being harrassed.

We are not buying headphones we are buying a car that is costly, we need to do whats best for us, they need to take some customer service and proper selling courses. Its about the customer and making them come back again. Will never return!!!! 0 STARS<//Text>

< Review>
So I went from a 1 star to a 5 star extremely fast. I was extremely upset that my 1 week old car was damaged by the detail department . Speaking to Irma was possibly the best thing the company had to offer. Her skills and quick response time to me was super professional. Give this woman a raise because not only did she fix the issue with my car but unlike most people, she actually went the extra mile to fix my issue. I am filled with joy that someone knows my pain and like I stared my car is brand new how could someone mess it up so fast right? Irma took care of the issue and I want the general manager and hopefully the upper ups that work at Nissan see that they have a very good employee there working for them. Not only to show people what Nissan can do for the customers but as well show that Nissan is a good business for friends and family to come and work with them.  5 stars for Irma most of all. Thank you for fixing my Altima issue.</Review>

<Review>My wife, Karen, & I have been shopping there for a few years now and we are very happy.  They treat us like family and give us the absolute best deal possible.  The general manager, John Fakhoury, spoils us & takes care of us. We love talking to and working with John.   All the sales people we have dealt with have also been wonderful to us.  We just got our 6th or 7th car there, 4 of our family members have Nissans.  The sales person today, Miguel was so friendly & helpful and we felt very comfortable with him.  We have previously recommended family and friends and we still highly recommend and encourage them and others.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp><date>1498975233169< /date><GmapID>0x80c34aa0cff756fb:0xf665e2421214d023<//GmapID><rating>5<//rating><user>110510246318564182122< /user><name>Lance Asbra</name><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Took our 2015 Altima in for service and other warranty work. I also purchased parts for our daughters 2003 Altima. Between the service dept. and parts dept., I had the best experience. I received our 2015 Altima on the same day with all work completed and parts department had all the parts I needed. Of course, all personnel were very courteous, helpful, and professional. My experience was truly exceptional and will return  for all my Nissan needs at Empire Nissan.<//text>

I was told that the battery has a 100,000 mile warranty, but now that I lost 10% of my battery life there is nothing I can do.  I can't get to where is need to get since I don't get the same milage.  I was told that I can travel to work going up the 15 freeway with a full charge and return while the car charges itself. I could only go up 15 mile before I lost 90% charge.  Now my wife can't even use it since  it can even travel to riverside from ontario.  Total miles will not exceed 60 and depreciating.  The car's heater is not working so the car is sitting at the company for the past 3 weeks.  They gave me rental after 8 days, a Versa. I still don't have the car back.  My advise, do not buy a leave if you have travel more than 50 miles.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c34aa0cff756fb:0xf665e2421214d023< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

In December I purchased a 2017 Nissan Maxima Platinum. The moonroof broke the 1st time I opened it in January.

Fast forward to today, and it's still not repaired! Of course there's a long story as to why, but currently the Service Department will not return my calls or update me on the status of the parts their Engineers needed. Despite multiple attempts for resolution, and showing up in-person to discuss the matter in May, I still have not been contacted.

If anyone's interested in a used & broken 2017 Nissan Maxima, let us know.

*Lastly, please inspect your car prior to leaving the lot after any maintenance. I picked up my car one late night and noticed my door was dented after I got home.</Review>

Our 2013 Altima has 54,000 miles on it.  The Air Conditioning went out & had to be completely replaced.  Luckily we had the extended warranty that  paid for it.  Now, as we are started on vacation, the CVT transmission is slipping like crazy making the car undriveable.  We just rented a Toyota Camry to take this  years vacation.  This transmission problem has been known to Nissan dealers for over  ten years but they neglect to inform you about it when they sell the car.  Someone will have to die in an accident caused by this problem before it is fixed.  My advice to anyone thinking about buying a Nissan product is to choose another make.   We are currently researching a Malibu or Ford Fusion.< /review>

<text>Empire Nissan's Service Department has always been perfectly helpful. Everything is done well at Empire Ontario CA. Joe Avila, Gary Worley, Renee, and the mechanics are excellent, really out of the ordinary.

My next car will be purchased at Empire Nissan, probably another Sentra. I purchased my current 2003 Sentra at Nissan San Bernardino in 2003; it has 212,000 miles. Empire Nissan does major maintenance every year, and I hope to drive this car till 300,000 miles, then purchase a 2023 Sentra. Thank you.<//text>< pictures>

In all the years of purchasing cars this by far was the best experience. From the start with Gil who showed me cars and answered all my questions. To then Edward Niebla, Eva Fuentes,Rizwan Ali in finance. But I would have to say that after visiting numerous dealers, one that even offered me a $600 lower cost on same car, but not color I wanted. What pulled me back essentially was the outstanding overall customer service of Nicole Talamantos. She went out of her way so that I was getting the exact car I wanted, answered all my question or spoke to whoever she needed to get me an answer. I would receive a call back when I was told to expect one. I never felt pressured or annoyed by anyone being pushy. I have already shared my experience with several, one who will soon be buying a new car. Great job and hope all your employees are this outstanding cuss all this does is bring people back and you know the best source of advertisement is word of mouth.. One very happy customer!!!

Monday December 28th I went to this dealership at around 6pm. I have a Nissan 350z and I was looking to upgrade to a 370z, I decided to come to this place because it has pretty good reviews and I was looking to get a car that night. When I got their I was greeted by a man who did not introduce himself so I was not able to catch his name. He asked how he could help me and I told him I was looking at getting a 370z he then pointed at the 370z's they had in stock so I walked over there and I asked if they had any white ones that was not a convertible, he gave me a short and quick response that they did not have any but that he could call me once they got some in. I was taken aback at how he did not even offer to show me the inside of the car or to go for a test drive. It felt as if he were trying to brush me off and basically get rid of me. So I told him that it was fine but I wanted to see the inside of the car, he told me "okay sure I'll go get the keys". I waited 25 minutes outside in the cold and he never came back, so of course I left. I'm not sure why this man would not want to make a sell or if he was just having a bad day, whatever the reason I was very displeased with the way he treated me and I would not recommend coming here, I do not know if this man was judging me by the way I look or what exactly went on here but I do NOT plan on going back to purchase a vehicle, although I do plan on going back to make sure this man does not keep doing what he is doing to other potential customers.<//text>

Gave me two quotes to replace my battery, once over the phone, the other in person, both saying it was gonna be $89. I've been waiting 50 minutes and 15 minutes before the procedure is done the guy comes up to me and says it's actually gonna be $350. Of course.<//text>

This is my second vehicle purchasing from Empire Nissan. My family has purchased MULTIPLE vehicles from here. Every time is a better experience than the last. My personal experience had been so smooth, quick and stress free. First and foremost, my salesman, Isaac is HANDS DOWN the best!!!! Adam in Finance, Riz with my contract.... and also BRENDA. She was such a big help when I needed paperwork for my TTL on my first vehicle. This team is so helpful and granted they are in sales, but not once did I ever feel like I was pressured or like they were taking advantage of me. Being a woman it’s always scary going to buy a vehicle from a MAN! Lol Im a pretty tough cookie too, but I felt taken care of. EVERY TIME. I would definitely recommend family and friends and I will forever be a LOYAL CUSTOMER. THANK YOU SO MUCH ENPIRE NISSAN for taking care of me! You guys are the best!!

*** ASK FOR ISAAC if you want the best customer service ***< /review>
