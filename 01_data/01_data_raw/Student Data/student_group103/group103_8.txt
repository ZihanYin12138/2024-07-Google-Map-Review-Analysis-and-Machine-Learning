I've been using ASAP, customer Rep Steven Pratt, when I need some obscure parts from time to time.  He has been able to provide the parts and then worked with me and getting a price that is reasonable.
Steven has been professional in all respects, including staying in contact with updates on searches and alternate parts.  I highly recommend working with Steven.  Their ability to find all types of parts is great.
Don't be afraid negotiate as ASAP is often purchasing from someone else. Let Steven negotiate for you if he can find what you need.< /Review>

Prior to finding ASAP I was No-bidding most of my obscure requests.  Now I am able to bid most everything competitively with the help of these guys!  Brett is amazing... Nothing has been to difficult.  They even go to the extent of working with my customer's engineers to clarify and develop needed items!  5Stars for sure!!< /Text>

Jordan Brown gave excellent customer service by getting me a quote back in a matter of a few mins and as well as making sure all shipping documents were correct and present when shipping out our order. I will definitely give my co-workers his email to assist with our needs in the near future. Jordan, I appreciate your help! Keep up the good work!!</text>

<text>I had to order a part for my job which needed much urgency and Nathan Pratt from Semiconductor jumped into action.  I was able to order the part and ship it across the country from California to Maine in less than 24hours.  Now that’s service!!! He was very professional and VERY easy to work with and I highly recommend dealing with him.  Thank you for making me look good Nate...<//text>< pics>

I first tried the manufacturer of the product.  Couldn’t even get a hold of them. Did some google searching and ended up with this company. Wow, It was like winning the lottery. Called and Nathan answered right away.  Tried explaining what we needed but i had no part numbers. Nathan said to email him the pics I had and he would do some research. An hour later and a couple of emails and damn,  if he didn’t find them. Thank you Nathan!!

<review>Called and spoke to Brett Gruidy about purchasing some hard to find parts. He was able to locate the parts and in the process of sending them our to me now. Once the payment was received it will take him only a few days to get them to me.  This benefits me because I was able to cut the lead time to my customer.

<review>terrible shopping experience, we asked them for a quote, we paid them what they quoted us, and when the delivery time was up they inform us that the parts had already been sold. We request a refund and it has been 20 days without obtaining it, and to this, we add that locating them is a problem, neither by mail nor by phone do we get an answer.< /review>< pictures>

I dealt with Tyler McKay. He was fast, polite, and delivered like he said he would. I would definitely recommend using Tyler for excellent service and will surely be going back to him for more parts needed in the future.< /Text>

The customer service from Mitchell Hinojosa has been exceptional! He is extremely helpful, and pleasant to chat with, whenever I call and need assistance looking for parts. He seems to be very knowledgeable and if there is a question he doesn't know, he looks into it and gets back to me.
He seems to go above and beyond every time and I can't express how helpful that is and how much it is appreciated.<//text>

<review>Once that you paid them, they stop answering your emails, and phone calls.
They neither have the parts that they were supposed to nor transfer back the money!

Sales rep was evidently having a really bad day or he's just an unhappy person in general. I called for a quote for a part on behalf of one of my vendors. I had the part number and the website showed there were parts in stock. All I needed was a price and MOQ. The guy wouldn't give me a price unless I could describe the part for him beyond the part description already listed on their website. He told me to use some common sense, find out what exactly I'm ordering, and send an email instead of calling. He wouldn't give me his name, so if anyone else from this business would like to talk to me please reply with a direct contact number.<//Review>

<Text>Working with Chris Converse has been a pleasure.  Through the several months that we both waited for the product to be manufactured and shipped, we developed a mental bond to anticipate each others questions.  Mainly, "Is there any updates on the order and when will Factory ship?"  We always keep each other abreast on the latest new, even when there wasn't any news.  In the end, factory got around to making and shipping, but working with Chris was a pleasure and look forward to next time.<//Text><username>Dan Bookhamer< /username><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>5< /Rate><resp>None< /resp><user>105352901426760006673</user></record>

<Text>ASAP Semiconductors without a doubt has been of the best organizations to manage our supply chain.
ASAP Semiconductors has been very helpful and supportive from the very beginning. They helped us find some obsolete parts that we were searching for from several sources. As a new organization, we required a lot more help with the entire procedure.
ASAP Semiconductors guided us through the entire process helping us choose the right products and services. ASAP Semiconductors goes about this in an extremely streamlined manner, ensuring a quick and smooth experience. Their assistance has meant a lot to us. Without their help, it would have been very difficult for us to complete this project for our simulator.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Tyler MacKay has been a huge help for me.  Whenever there are parts I can’t find on the market, A.S.A.P either has them or knows where to find them.  Tyler has been very professional and has helped me keep projects on time.</Text>

I've made at least five purchases from ASAP in the last year and have always had a good experience. The staff is very knowledgeable and responsive and their product line is quite comprehensive. I've found some items through ASAP that I couldn't locate through other vendors. Highly recommended.</review>

Our company requested a quote through the website and followed up with a call only to be refused pricing for a quote.  We were told we had to purchase the parts to get a price.  Poor customer service.</Review>

This was my first time buying from ASAP Semiconductor.. Brett Guidry was my salesperson. He responded very quickly with pricing, followed up with me.  When I received the order short of the quantity I ordered, he immediately checked in to the problem and advised me and solved the issue very quickly.< /review>

< review>
Tried to order a part for an AOG from this company. I was told they had 2 in stock, 1 overhauled and 1 serviceable. I ordered them early on Thursday morning. I called several times Thursday to pay and get them shipped overnight with no response. On Friday, I again tried and failed on numerous occasions so pay for the items and have them shipped overnight. I finally received a call back on Friday around noon saying that they did not have these parts they were the wrong part #. A couple hours later they called back once again and said they did actually have the parts and they could ship them overnight. This was late Friday afternoon. Monday morning I wired them the money so they could ship these overnight and arrive at my facility first thing Tuesday. Tuesday morning I call to get the tracking information and I am told that they actually don't have the parts ready that they have to go to the repair shop first and it would be 2 more days. At this point I am frustrated and at my limit and I have to get prior approval at this point because my higher ups are getting frustrated as well but they are my only option and I have an AOG so what do you do. When I get approval to wait on the repaired parts he now tells me it will actually be 7 to 10 days. At this point I have been lied to and jerked around so much that I had been researching high and low for alternatives and luckily I finally found another facility that can actually repair the 2 I have in 2 days so I cancel my order and go with the other company.</review>

Sent an RFQ for a specific PN and ASAP responded with an extremely high estimate, but we needed the parts so we agreed. They subsequently told us they didn't actually have the PNs we requested but had an available-everywhere equivalent, for another ridiculous price (way above market), that we could not use in our application (which is why we requested a specific PN). Of course, this came AFTER we were told to overnight a check to them, which had to be stopped and cancelled. Not a good way to do business.</Review>

Excellent inspection! Took lots of pictures and explained their importance. He went beyond the immediate scope pointing out potential hazards even including my power line hanging too low. Obviously likes the job, no complaints about heat or anything else. Made my day better just learning about house's condition. Strongly recommend him!<//Review>

Allen @ Inspection Pro provided a very thorough inspection of my 90 year old home.  Allen is very knowledgeable and took his time explaining the challenges of owning an older home. I was very impressed that Allen actually crawled under the house.  He explained that he can determine the true condition of the foundation by physical access.  The detailed report was awesome. Even though there are major repairs, I can prioritize
needed repairs.  I appreciate the time and expertise Allen provided during the inspection and the through report.  I would highly recommend Allen for your home inspection needs.< /review>

Allen was on time and very knowledgeable regarding the issues affecting an older home.  Allen explained the inspection process and answered all questions and concerns.  The detailed report with pictures and comments of items inspected will be very helpful in determining how to proceed with repairs to the house.

We used inspection Pro for a home inspection of a home that we were interested in purchasing.  We have experience over the years with multiple home purchases and sales and we wanted to avoid our previous mistakes we have made by using inspectors whom we ultimately realized had not been very thorough.  We are happy to say that Allen was very thorough and helpful at explaining his findings and guiding the relative significance of items he identified.  He was professional, knowledgeable, and timely.  His report was clear and well documented.  I strongly recommend his services for anyone who wants a thorough and unvarnished inspection of a residential home.< /review>

Allen was extremely thorough and knowledgeable. He did a home inspection and energy audit for us. He gave us some great pointers to improve our energy usage, as well as showed us what we need to repair and update in our home. I would definitely recommend him and will use him in the future as our needs require.< /text>

<text>On a short notice Allen was quite accommodating to schedule the home inspection so we could meet the escrow deadlines.  After his inspection, Allen went over the details of his reports.  Both my wife and I are happy that we chose Inspection Pro.</text>< Time>

Wow.  Rarely write reviews, but Allen over-delivered on expectations.  I was looking for opportunities to reduce electricity usage ~25% or so.  Inspection identified opportunities to reduce by 40%!  Best part for me, most of the solutions recommended are low-cost and DIYable.  ...and I would have said this just based on the 30-min debrief call after inspection (hadn't yet opened the 55-page detailed report with all the pics, thermal imaging, and numbers to support the findings).  Thanks Allen!< /Text>

I needed a home inspection as part of a refinance. Allen did a thorough inspection and wrote a great report of his findings that addressed all of the mortgage company's concerns. He also gave me tips on possible maintenance items that he saw, and answered my questions on the best way to address those issues. I found Allen to be very professional and great to work with.< /review>

<text>Allen did a roof inspection on our older home on November 23, 2020. He surprised me agreeably with his quick response for a quote and a date of service, through Yelp. His price was reasonable. After the inspection, he took the time to describe each aspect of concern of the roof with proof of pictures he took, and to answer my questions. I found Allen knowledgeable and trustworthy. I received his report sooner than I expected. His report was very thorough, with clear pictures of the problems. I highly recommend Allen/Inspection Pro. I will definitely use his service for future inspections. I forgot some important information about this company: Allen does inspections only, and does not do repairs. So you can be assured that his reports will be honest with no biased findings that could bring him more capital gain.</text>< resp>

<Text>Allen is amazing! We recently purchased a new manufactured home in a community. After getting the run around from the setup installers and factory we decided to find an independent inspector to be 100% certain we were not being fed a line. Allen arrived early and completed an extremely thorough inspection. Allen uncovered many things we did not know about our new home. We are extremely grateful to Allen and his meticulous attention to detail. Because of Allen, the factory and setup team will be making the necessary corrections to our home. I 100% recommend Allen to anyone who values their investments. Thank you Allen!</Text>< pictures>

Allen was extremely professional and through. He took his time going through every part of the house. He explained every issue to us and gave us advice on negotiating the price because of certain repairs we would have to do. His report was extremely detailed. He is amazing and affordable! Great value for the money we spent! I would highly recommend his services!<//Text>

<Text>My wife is a Realtor and uses Allen for her clients home inspections. We hired Allen to do an inspection on a commercial property our family was thinking about purchasing. As always, he did a phenomenal job providing us with a detailed report of the property. He also met with us after his inspection and walked us through his findings. Allen's rate was very reasonable for the amount of time and work he did. I highly recommend him for your inspections.<//Text><Time>1604266111398< /Time>< response>

Allen performed an extensive inspection of a 100+ year old historic home that I am in escrow to purchase.  He was very well versed in the kinds of issues common to older homes.  After the inspection he walked us through the home to point out his findings and answer any questions we might have.  He was professional, on-time for the inspection, and his report was issued quickly.  An added bonus is the online tool to generate a repairs request list directly from the inspection report.  Very highly recommended!< /review>

Allen gave our potential future home a very thorough inspection and was kind enough to take the time to walk us through the house and explain in detail the results. My wife and I are in the process of purchasing our first home and the inspection Allen gave the home gave us the confidence to know this is the right home for us. We really appreciate the time and effort he spent on inspecting the home and explaining to us the good things about it as well as what should be fixed. He was very up front and honest which we really appreciated because this is our first home buying experience. We would recommend Allen and his company to anyone who is in the market to purchase a home especially if it is your first home.  Thanks Allen!< /Review>

<Text>Professionals like Allen seem to be rare these days. I couldn't recommend highly enough, and I think it was the best money I've spent in a long time. Allen was very clear about expectations and explaining the process at every step; before the appointment, during and after. He was punctual, professional, and far more thorough than I could have expected. He explained and showed his findings to me in person, and the level of detail in the photos and descriptions makes understanding the true condition of a home about as good as you could get without tearing walls down or using x-ray equipment. We dodged a major "money pit" nightmare with the findings Allen provided, and I'm happy to say with 100% certainty that I will use him on our next prospective home (hopefully soon), and will highly recommend his services to anyone. Thank you Allen!</Text>< pictures>

This review is being written in favor of Allen Coggan at Inspection Pro, whom I hired to perform a general inspection of a home for sale in the Tower/Fresno High School area. Mr. Coggan spoke with me over the phone for one hour explaining his protocol for evaluating a property. He then spent more than three hours at the site carefully checking each structure/system. The report is a lengthy but well organized and clearly summarized one with dozens of photos as supporting evidence for each finding. He then made himself available for an hour-long follow up meeting during which everything was explained in an understandable way to a person not versed in construction. In turn, it was possible for me to use the results in negotiating a more than fair repairs credit with the seller. The fee is extremely reasonable, especially considering his expertise, the included documentation, and the time and effort put forth. If you’d like true peace of mind about your decision to go through with a real estate transaction, call Allen Coggan at Inspection Pro.

<Text>My husband and I hired Inspection Pro twice and were extremely satisfied with their inspections. The first time was part of the home inspection with a house we are currently in escrow on. Allen showed up on time, was wearing a mask (very important with COVID-19 concerns right now) and spent time reviewing his findings with the realtor and myself afterwards. He explained the main safety issues, maintenance suggestions and then showed us the main issues throughout the house. He was patient and clearly knowledgeable in home inspections. Within a day he e-mailed us the home inspection report. It was sent to us in a timely manner and contained clear photos and detailed explanations of all the issues he had reviewed with us during the in-person inspection.

Part of the home purchase involved the builder’s warranty covering the major repairs that Allen’s report had pointed out. I was concerned about the repairs being done properly, so I asked my realtor if we could hire Allen again to confirm the repairs had been done. With only about a 48-hour notice, he was able to fit this second inspection into his schedule and conducted a follow-up inspection of the home. He provided photos confirming the repairs had been completed and spent time going over his findings over the phone with me. His timeliness and thoroughness were much appreciated during our home inspection period. He is clearly knowledgeable, experienced and honest and I would not hesitate to hire him again for any future home inspections. Would highly recommend to anyone who needs a home inspection done!</Text><Gmap_id>0x809467fe2845913f:0xfd248ac9a1537cc9<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Inspection Pro continues to be the go-to home inspector in Fresno. Allen is thorough to a fault. His detailed reports leave no stone unturned and he saves investors, home buyers and sellers money every time. My two cents: Inspection Pro is an incredible value when assessing, buying, selling or vetting a commercial or residential property. I highly recommend them for home inspections in Fresno!<//Text>< Name>

Thank you Allen, and Inspection Pro. Everything was great from the price to the inspection, to all the precautions you put in place for Covid 19. The report was so helpful and easy to understand, and Allen thank you for taking time to answer questions and personalize the process.

<review>Allen was referred to me by a buddy of mine. Allen conducted a home inspection on my future home. He was very thorough and took the time to explain in great detail, the issues he discovered. Allen offered solutions to the minor repairs and also gave his expert opinion on the potential cost for such repairs. Allen prepared an inspection report in a couple days and it was very thorough and informative with photos. I highly recommend his work to others.</review>< pictures>

I was in the process of buying a home, the agent I was working with at that time hired the inspector. When I received the inspection report I was very disappointed with it. Is was pretty much a check off list, didn't have many pictures and a lot of things were left out. Luckily I found Allen from Inspection Pro. He was very thorough with the inspection, his report included a lot of pictures of his findings. He took time more than once to explain things to me, because I have no experience on home construction and or home maintenance.  Allen made it to where I could understand everything. He is a very polite and nice person. Now I recommend him to my friends and family because I know that his inspections are very thorough, he takes time to explain everything on his report.<//text>

<review>I was buying a house in Clovis and my realtor suggested me some companies. I read the reviews and they were not much good. Then I tried searching on my own and I found Inspection Pro got really some impressive reviews. I send a message through yelp to Inspection Pro and Allen responded in half an hour even it was after hours. Allen was so responsive then I asked my agent to work directly with Allen and got him scheduled for inspection. The home is just 3 years and I was even not in the mood of inspection but Allen really did a great detailed job and came back to me the next day with email having link to the web portal where my report was . It was so convenient to check the online report and a cool feature was the auto generated repairs request list which could be sent directly to the seller's agent.   For the report , I would say Allen went beyond and best . He pointed out so many construction flaws which were major safety issues as well as minor leaks which could lead to water intrusions in near feature. I have deal in homes before but never saw this kind of detailed report with cool feature.
Even after the report , he called me and explained me the issues he found and their level of severity. He was so easy to work with and I will recommend him to my family and friends for sure.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x809467fe2845913f:0xfd248ac9a1537cc9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5</rate><text>I recently asked Allen Coggan from Inspection Pro Fresno to inspect a house before I purchased.  He did an excellent job and I would rate his performance 5 out of 5 stars.  I will recommend his service to everyone.   Right after my buyer agent reached him, he immediately returned the call and gave us the price and schedule.  He was very punctual and polite.   After a few hours working he showed me what he found in details. He covered every corners of the houses.  I meant he found all problems, big and small.   Allen was professional during the entire process.  His report was very impressive, too.  It had lots of pictures with arrows pointing to the defects.  It was organized and complete.  I am very pleased with his work.</text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Allen was nothing short of amazing. He was incredibly professional, very thorough in his process, and very detailed in his write-up afterwards. He was punctual; Allen arrived right on time and was very communicative in the days leading up to the inspection.

As an investor purchasing a multi family property, I needed someone who can see things beyond the ordinary (items that had maintenance deferred that might be costly in the long-run, items that have liability risks, etc). He pointed out things that I would’ve overlooked and took his full time explaining what he found. 10/10 experience. I appreciated that he adhered to proper safety protocols amidst the pandemic (he wore a mask, socially distanced). If you’re in the area and need a quality inspector, Allen is your guy. I plan to use Allen going forward for any and all of my home inspections in the area and will have my family use him as well. All in all: I was very pleased with Allen’s professionalism, attention to detail, and the overall quality of the entire experience.

The write-up that Allen sent afterwards was lengthy in a very good way: it was full of pictures, arrows, clean and informative descriptions/captions, easy-to-follow, and safety issues were clearly highlighted. I fully recommend and stand by Home Inspection Pro!

Thanks Allen! Can't wait to do business again.</Text>< Pictures>

I hired Inspection Pro to conduct a safety report on an A/C leak in my attic. The technician spent an hour on the phone with me answering my questions. I asked them to come inspect the damage. My Insurance Company had not decided on whether repairs were needed in the attic. It had been over a month since I filed my claim. I sent Inspection Pro’s report to my Insurance Company and they approved the repairs within 2 days.  I wish I would have contracted Inspection Pros earlier, to save a lot of frustration and miscommunication.<//text>

<text>Allen is the most thorough inspector I have ever worked with. He spent about 4.5 hours inspecting our first home and gave us the confidence we needed to go through with the purchase. He truly went above and beyond to identify any trouble areas with the property and helped teach us how we can make those repairs ourself. I plan on using Allen for any future home inspections we may need.< /text></record>

Allen inspected my home a few weeks ago. He did a very detailed  job. I received the report complete with photos ( problem areas highlighted with red arrows) within a week. If you are interested in having a home report done by a knowledgeable professional. I would highly recommend Allen of Inspection Pro.</text>

Allen Coggan is the best home inspector that we have worked with.  He provides excellent service, thorough knowledge of the housing requirements, and communicates clearly all the home repairs needed.

We highly recommend Allen and will definitely be repeat customers!<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Refreshing, thorough, high-quality, pays attention to detail and provides subject matter expertise and recommendations.  Allen allowed me to walk around with him (off-&-on) for greater than 2-hours, while he took the time to explain the slightest concerns I had, as a first-time-purchaser.  No question was to simplistic for him to address with information that a person not in his field could comprehend. It is welcoming to find individuals these days, that are passionate about their work and pays attention to details. Knowledgeable & informative, and Allen's years of experience is evident.  Would I recommend Allen and Inspection Pro? YES.  Would I use Allen and Inspection Pro again? YES< /Text>< Pics>

As first time home buyers, we had no idea how the home inspection works and didn’t know any home inspector. But after meeting Allen, we learnt a lot about the inspection process. Allen was very thorough in his inspection and clarified all our doubts. His report had really fine details of even minor defects which we would have never noticed. He was very professional and meticulous and was very patient. His answers clearly told us that he is very experienced and up to date and had the latest tools and equipment needed to perform the highest quality home inspection. I will highly recommend Allen for an unbiased, trustworthy and diligent home inspection.<//Text>

<text>Allen was wonderful to work with, from the initial phone call to receipt of  the inspection report.  As first time home buyers a lot of apprehension and self doubt can enter into the process, but his professionalism and detailed manner helped guide us through and feel confident about our purchase.  Would not hesitate to work with Allen and Inspection Pro in the future.  THANK YOU.<//text>< pictures>

Allen presented to us the most conscientious and thorough inspection we have ever encountered.  He simplified our due diligence with one morning inspection.   His meticulously prepared report arrived sooner than expected and exemplifies not only his eye for detail but also his wealth of knowledge.  I especially appreciated that Allen took the time to answer some questions I had over the phone.  I highly recommend Inspection Pro to anyone who wants to ensure that their investment has been seen through Allen’s intelligent and critical eyes before closing escrow.</Text>

<review>We had our home inspection performed by Allen, and he did a fantastic job for us. He spent well over 3 hours inspecting the home thoroughly, updated us on his findings throughout the inspection, and provided us with advice on roughly how much the repairs would cost. He is an exceptional inspector, and I would highly recommend him for your home inspection. His inspection afforded us the ability to understand how many repairs would be needed so there would not be any surprises for us down the road. He is flexible with his scheduling and gives you a very detailed report to review once the inspection is completed. We were thrilled with selecting him for our home inspection. Choose Allen and you will be glad you did during the home buying process!</review>< Time>

<text>I recently purchased a home and I was having a hard time finding someone who had reasonable rates and knew what they were doing. Inspection Pro took the time to answer ALL of my questions without hesitation. Inspection Pro took about 3-4 hrs to carefully inspect the property I was purchasing and then go over the findings. Inspection Pro found a handful of things that needed to be fixed that other inspectors would have probably missed!</text>< pics>

Allen's inspections were extremely thorough and detailed. He spent hours in our home inspecting every inch of it. Even cosmetic issues! -He wants to give you as must information about the home as possible that you as a buyer can use to your advantage when negotiating.

He got the extensive reports to us by the next day which helped the  process move along very quickly.  Every so often, he would walk me through and tell me what he has found. He is a teacher! He explained to us certain issues, what they meant, reasons why that might happen and different ways the issue could be resolved. I felt like I had learned so much the first time in person and through the detailed report that I want to use Allen for the second time around !!!  He was very warm and welcoming, and not intimidating when he spoke about things we didn't understand or had not heard about before going through the home buying process.

All this is why I am going to use him again this year and I would recommend him to friends and family who plan on buying a home.

When buying a home and just bought a home from like myself.  Home inspection is must and I truly value Allen's work ethics and his company!!!

There are House Inspectors are out there...  Using Inspection Pro is no brainer!!!<//Text>

<Date>1576203350037<//Date><Text>10.	Coming from out of the area we had no clue where to start with an inspector. After looking at the reviews and comparing quotes I went with Inspection Pro, I’m so glad I did. Allen was wonderful, he is very detailed and takes his time going through the whole property inside and out. After he was done he went through and explained everything to us and gave us an idea on how big of a fix it would be. We were so grateful for his thoroughness, because it us such a big decision buying a house and having a safe home to live in, especially with kids. You can tell that he really cares about what he does. I will definitely be using him again!!! Thank you Allen!!!< /Text>< gmapID>

I recently had a home inspection done by Allen, from Inspection Pro. Allen spent a considerable amount of time testing and visually inspecting components of the home I'm purchasing. He points out with pictures and illustrates a very briefly detailed report of what he's doing and finds each step of the way, which makes his report very easy to understand.
I HIGHLY recommend Allen from Inspection Pro to anyone thinking about purchasing a home.
Thank you very much for your professionalism, very satisfied with your services.< /text>

I made it a point to leave this review! The bottom line is to choose Allen and Inspection Pro. I called Allen Sunday and he told me he had been booked out two weeks in advance, but he was still able to get us in during the same week and spent nearly FOUR hours inspecting our new home, we could not believe how thorough he was. He's professional, trustworthy, undeniably knowledgeable about home inspections and helpful in explaining in his findings. He went above and beyond with his inspection, photos and reporting. I found Allen on Yelp, but by the end of the inspection our realtor was asking for his business card to work with him in the future. He was wonderful!!!!< /Review>

<review>Allen Coggan at Inspection Pro was great to work with.  I have used him for 3 home inspections in the past few months including for one that included working with difficult parties.  His reports are thorough and arrive set up in a program that allows you to easily create a "repair list" for use with buyers and sellers.  He is easy to communicate with, returns phone calls quickly, and is thoroughly professional.  I highly recommend Inspection Pro for your home inspection needs.</review><gmapID>0x809467fe2845913f:0xfd248ac9a1537cc9<//gmapID>< Pics>

After getting a hvac company to scope the ducts it was found they were broken and encased in the concrete slab of the house. Allen directing me to follow up with that saved me over 15k, the sellers refused to fix problem or reduce price. House number 2, he found items to be corrected, I worked with seller to fix and close this week. Overall great inspection, very detailed and complete< /review>< Pics>

Being a new person in town, I was a bit anxious when I  had to choose an inspector who I have never known. But Allen turned out to be a perfect inspector for me. He was very thorough with every area of the house. With his expertise and professionalism, he carefully explained to me with every finding that he had. Additionally, his inspection report was amazing with the color HD pictures and the arrows pointing to.  He is my inspector for life!  One more tip, stay at the site while Allen is inspecting. Those realtors will  push and hurry the inspection so they can close with no findings. Don't let those realtors bully your inspection!< /Text>

2020 has been a challenging year for all.  Fresno/Clovis has faced many challenges and overcome them with their heads held high and an atitude that we shall overcome.  I must admit I was skeptical when I decided to have my home inspected for possible "repairs." My son, who lives in Norway is presently conducting business in Connecticut.  He also agreed we should find an exceptional contractor,  did his research, and agreed Allen was the  "one for us." My son emailed Allen who immediately answered and an appointment was scheduled. How lucky was I!!   Allen was prompt for our meeting, was courteous and articulate in outlining what procedures would be addressed. He inspected both inside and outside my home while wearing the covid19 rules including wearing a facemark and gloves.  He left the house spotless showing no indication of dirt or exterior foliage. As promised, within a day, he presented me a very detailed report, which included thermal imaging photos, findings, a table of contents, and summary.  Presented in a professional folder, the report was clearly summarized and easy to follow.  In summary, Allen went "over the top" in his inspection.  He faced many challenges of covid 19  wih a positive attitude.  Kudos to Allen!!< /Text>

I highly recommend Inspection Pro.  The owner Allen came to inspect a condo I purchased in Fresno and he was very professional. He walked my husband who was present through everything he was inspecting. A detailed report with clear photos was provided. He was kind to speak with me for over an hour about my inspection questions.</text>

<Text>Recently I had the pleasure of meeting Allen; since he was selected to provide me an Inspection on a Multi-unit property. Allen was extremely thorough and quite knowledgeable in things to look for in a potential property.
After his inspection he took the time to walk me through some of the safety items as well as other items that may have required additional information that he’d documented during his inspection.
The final report was amazing. I hadn’t purchased a property in a while, but I really appreciated the detailed online report with its explanations, clear pictures and arrows pointing to the specific areas which he indicated.
I would definitely use Allen again and really appreciate his very nice demeanor and thorough knowledge.
Thank you.</Text>< gmapID>

I called Alllen to check out my roof & tell me what I needed to do.  He was very personable, professional, competent & his qualilty of work excellent.  I felt I could trust him about his professional opinion so I could go forward with the repair of my roof.  He gave me his knowledge/expertise about what to look for & what to ask for in the companies I would ask quotes from.  Thank you Allen for your compasion & understanding of my situtation.  I highly recommend Allen for any roof inspection a person would need.</Text>

I just wanted to take a moment and write a "Thank you" note for the home inspection that you did on my sister's property.  The report was very well written with pictures and descriptions.  My sister and I are very pleased with the service you've provided.  We would not have known a brand new house could have so much defects without your keen eyes.  We both will definitely use your service again in the near future.  Thank you so much!< /text>

<review>I’m a real estate agent and this was my first time working with Allen. I was truly impressed by how thorough, detailed and meticulous he was. Allen spent over three hours inspecting the property my client was purchasing and spent additional time afterward walking through the property with my client and I to point out things he noted during his inspection. His knowledge and expertise in construction and home inspection was amazing! Allen even followed up with me afterward regarding a concern my client had about a fireplace. He is very professional, experienced and I highly recommend his service.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Allen was extremely thorough and professional. He took the time to share many details about our new home. The detailed report he provided gave us the information and professional documentation that helped us get the repairs needed on the home we are purchasing, but beyond that helped us get acquainted with our new home. Some of the details he gave us would have taken years for us to discover. Allen is a new home owner's must-call.</review>

Allen spent over three and a half hours inspecting the home. Afterwards, he pointed out things he noted during his inspection.

The price was great, the inspection was thorough, the report was fantastic and easy to navigate, and his quality of customer care was 5*. We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Inspection Pro in the future. We did our research and after reading several outstanding reviews, Insection Pro was hands down our choice. We agree with the previous clients of Allen in that he exceeded our expectations.</Review>< GmapID>

I spoke with Allen on the phone a week prior to needing my home inspection. He was very upfront and clear about what he would do in his inspection. He answered all my questions and spent time with his explanations. Being a 1st time home buyer and having no clue what to expect, I was impressed with his knowledge. A week later I called him to set appointment and He was able to accommodate a short notice appointment. Once inspection was done, We walked the property, he was very thorough in pointing out things. I am even more confident with my purchase going forward. The report is broken down in detailed form.
Finally, the customer service is Great!
I would recommend you call Inspection Pro for all you home inspection needs.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>In preparation for getting my house in shape for selling, I wanted a roof inspection and searched extensively online. Inspection Pro was the company that had by far the most 5 star reviews from customers and an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau, along with descriptions of the careful and thorough work that was performed for these reviewers. Allen did not disappoint. He responded quickly and described his process for evaluating the condition of the roof in its current state. The very reasonable cost easily fit my budget. We arranged a date and within a few days, I received a detailed report about what needed to be done, complete with enlarged photos and comments to explain what needed repair and/or replacement. It has been so helpful to share this document with potential contractors to illustrate what needs to be corrected. Allen is professional and courteous, and I would highly recommend his services.<//text>< pics>

My husband and I contracted Allen back in August 2018 to do a home inspection.  This was our first time dealing with home buying and it’s process.  I went with Allen because of his excellent reviews on yelp and because of our first conversation over the phone.  Well needless to say, Allen delivered a detailed and thorough home inspection and gave us quality feedback from the inspection report.  Fortunately, for us the home offer fell through because the sellers refused to do repairs and were over- pricing the home.  I say we were fortunate because we found a better home that was flipped and remodeled and so of course we called Allen for our second home inspection; he delivered us with another detailed home inspection and gave us quality time over the phone discussing the repairs needed for this new home.  We haven’t closed escrow, but I’m glad that in the “shady” business of home buying where there are a lot of second guessing on people’s motives (especially when it comes to our money) we don’t guess Allen’s motives; he truly is on the home buyers side!</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Does not know how to explain a report to a buyer! He created a sense of panic in the buyer. There is a difference between items to ask for in a real estate transaction and items the buyer should be aware of. He made the entire report seem like an emergency. He included warnings about things like breakers that he knew nothing about rather than finding an answer. I wish I could give him zero starts. I have been an agent for 14 years and this is the worst home inspector I have ever seen!<//Review>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><text>Allen did an absolutely outstanding job on my home inspection during my home buying process. He thoroughly explained over the phone everything he would be looking for prior to the inspection, arrived on time, and afterwards went over much of what he had found with me in person to give me a better understanding of the scope and severity of the issues that arose. He helped differentiate issues that could be handled DIY even for a layman like myself versus items that posed a safety hazard and should be attended to by an expert. Afterwards, Allen's written inspection report was so coherent and comprehensive it looked like he had spent weeks working on it, even though I received it within only a couple days of the inspection. I would recommend Inspection Pro without reservation to anyone that is in the buying process.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Absolutely amazing! Do you want to know what is wrong with your home before you sell it, or would just like to know in general? Hire Allen from Inspection Pro and be prepared with a pen and paper. Allen stood outside in the rain with me after my inspection to discuss ways for me to help repair what I needed to get done. Inspection Pro is an unbiased, untainted service that gives you the black and white facts of what is wrong with your home, no sugar coating. I heard many realtors get upset that the inspection costed them a sale. Maybe those realtors should not have been shady and greedy and kept their clients best interest in mind, as well as the buyers. Whether your home is 2 years old or 80, give Allen a call.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809467fe2845913f:0xfd248ac9a1537cc9<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The review with the 1 star by the real estate agent is not accurate.  I was the buyer and the inspector did not create a sense of panic nor did he say i must have everything fixed or to walk away from the house.  The inspector simply and throughly pointed out flaws in the house that showed the house required a great amount of work.  the roof needed to be completely redone. there was mold from a prior leak in the house and he simply showed with pics and and facts what needed to be repaired.  the inspector did not any way try to influence our purchase.  he was also extremly backed up with reports but ws able to get our fully customized report out the next day.  I will never buy a house without having his inspect it and he even came to my parents house the next week to inspect our roof after we put in solar to make sure it was done correctly.  He even gave us a discount that he did not have advertise but he said he was giving to others and said he would give it to us.  all in all he is a true 5 star and unfortunately the 1 star review could not be further from the truth.  when you are that good at what you do and you deny someone a sale someone will say something negative<//Text>

TRULY ABOVE & BEYOND! I called Inspection Pro purely by accident, due entirely to a rookie mistake made by an inexperienced customer service agent at PG&E- a mistake I am so glad they made!
Having just rented our house less than a week prior, I was ofcourse trying to get all the utilities turned on & in my name. I was scheduled for a Saturday, "all-day" appt, meaning PG&E can show up to turn your power on Saturday anytime between 8am-8pm. So after sitting & waiting all day & still no power, I decided to call & find out why; & after sitting through another 45 minutes of prompts & hold music, I was finally speaking to a very new, very inexperienced, although very helpful young human. When he finally managed to pull up my acct, he was able to tell me that PG&E didnt miss my appt, they had been there at 2 o'clock that afternoon & determined that my panel needed an inspection before they could restore services to my address, not that they walked 15feet to my front door to tell me that or called even to let me know there was no need to waste the remainder of a beautiful Saturday afternoon waiting for power, cuz it wasnt comin anytime soon! Nah... So there i was, looking forward to another long weekend with 5 kids & still no water or the power that they were promised would be on by that Sat night, with no idea what to do next, on the phone with the nicest customer service agent ever who was unfortunately just as clueless as me at that point, so on the verge of helpless tears I asked him what i should do next. He asked me to hold while he searched somethin real quick & when he came back on the line he gave me the number to INSPECTION PRO & told me "They can help". Even though it was now late Sat night, i figured i could call & leave a message so maybe id be first to get a call back Monday. To my surprise, Allen answered! He patiently listened to my whole story, tears & all & when i was done he made an appt to come out and take a look the next day! on a SUNDAY, with zero notice!!  And he showed up just like he said he would & then called me with his very thorough report that evening, he then explained that his services would usually cost this much etc etc, but since he knew what a rough time I was having, knowing theres no way i could even afford his very reasonable fees, he made me an offer that wouldnt break my bank and was more than fair, if anything I kinda feel like i took advantage of him & his very thorough services!
Overall, he was very Professional, yet Down to Earth & Understanding at the same time. I would recommend Allen & Inspection Pro 100%!</text>

Allen is amazing, he takes his time and finds every single issue that is wrong with a place, even just minor things that you should know about that could possibly cause you issues in the future.  When he is done with his inspection, he will meet with you and take the time to show you all the stuff he found, he goes into great deal and explains the current condition and how it should be.  He is very knowledgeable about everything home related it seems, he can explain how each and every issue should be fixed or corrected.  He even found tiny cracks that need to be sealed that we would have never have seen ourselves, plus takes many pictures for the report, so you can see every crack, or every nail that is sticking up in the roof that just needs to be hammered down.  I have had him do 3 inspections for me and he is worth every penny.  His reports are so detailed and even broken down into sections with a table of contents, which helps because you can forward it to someone like an electrician and they can look at all the electrical problems and give you a quote without wasting their time going through tons of pages that they cannot help with.  Anyone I know that buys a house in the future I will make sure they go through Allen.  Take your time and get the right person to inspect your house, don't just go with the person your agent is setting you up with that might not take the time and find all the issues before you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a place.</text>

<text>Allen was very thorough during the inspection and in the report. Due to unforeseen circumstances, he was still able to accommodate us by coming back to the house a 2nd time to complete the full inspection (e.g. inspecting attic and crawl space). During the inspection, he really took the time to explain all the issues, how things should be fixed, advice on repairs, and homeowner responsibilities for the future. If it wasn't for the honest conversations I had with him, I don't think I would have been as prepared or confident with my final request for repairs. A recommendation I would suggest is to delete repetitive content in the report, to help reviewing it be easier. Otherwise, Allen comes from a long history of working in construction and he truly is serving the community. I highly recommend Inspection Pro.</text>< resp>

This guy was the worst ever. He does not know what he is going, called out things inappropriately and with no basis other than he did not know what he was looking at. We had 7 contractors as well as other specialists review his repirt and every single one of them could not believe he has a license. Big mistake!< /text>

<review>Bill and Wags is always quick and professional. They always manage to make the best out of a bad situation. The tow truck driver Larry Hile (359) was professional, courteous, and was able to make quick work of my tow needs. I would highly recommend this company and this driver for all of your towing needs. Thank you again Bill and Wags, and thanks again Larry.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<name>Cezar Barajas<//name><review>Bill & Wags is always fast, professional, convenient, and friendly. The are conscientious and respond quickly when you are stranded out on the road. Unfortunately, I have had to use them four times in the past 3-5 years or so. Once was for being winched out of a ditch during a snow storm up in Big Bear. I tried to turn around, and my tire got caught in the snow, on an unseen slope underneath. I was on my way to a party. They responded quickly, and I was late to the party, but I made it! I didn’t wait long at all. Twice I had two flat tires due to the treacherous streets in Highland & San Bernardino and once the battery in my dates car died. One of the owners was close by that time, and showed up personally to make sure we were OK! Now that is service!! I  have referred them multiple times, due to my positive experiences. They have never disappointed me or damaged any of my vehicles  and I continue to output positive feedback about Bill & Wags. I will continue to recommend them, and use them in the future, should I have the need. They are the best in Ontario! Highly recommend!! ✌🏽</review><date>1610662940088</date><Response>{'time': 1610720523446, 'text': "That is so amazing to hear, Cezar!

They charge an obscene price to recover a vehicle. Very unethical, unsanitary and unprofessional, their counter was extremely dirty, and they were wiping their counter as they were processing our transaction, which was very rude. I'm not sure how these people can sleep at night knowing  that they've stiffed people during a pandemic. They charged us for over an hour of labor while the same job can be done by someone else for less than an hour. No rational person with a basic conception of ethics can sleep at night doing what these people do.</Text>

Unless you're a business and have an account with this company, do not trust them at all.

They only have two drivers that have as much as experience as they claim. They will charge you for literally everything. They ask for your credit/debit card information, then process fraudulent charges months later. They lie about how long they've been in business. They'll move your car from one spot to another in your apartment just so they can tow it. And the list of things they do just keeps going on and on.

Whatever you do, DO NOT call Bill & Wag's.<//Text><username>Alondra Saenz<//username></record></dataset><record>

Even when your car is stolen and the police find it and have to tow it. You still have to pay. The ladies in the office are extremely rude and will leave u waiting for 20 minutes before even speaking to you. The whole time their talking to each other or on the phone. The police are in cohorts with them. They called me almost an hour after calling bill and wags to tow my vehicle. My car wasn't even their for  5 hours and it cost me $252 to get it out. Or I had the option to pay the money and I let them keep my car with the pickslip. The last option was to let the car go, and it would acculmate daily fees for 30 days. After the car is auctioned off, they place you in collections for any remaining balance.   What a SCAM!!!!< /Text>

Very professional, highly recommend them for local towing for all your needs including commercial and heavy duty. Their fleet is late model and immaculately maintained, not like a lot of these junkyard haulers.<//text>

I hate to have any of my trucks or vehicles on the hook but when I do We only call Bill & Wag’s Towing.
Our truck broke down, called in, Stephanie was courteous and us being repeat customers gave us a fair price.
As usual their equipment Is First Class👍🏻  Driver Introduced himself as Mitch, he has a great attitude and  is very professional, got our  truck towed into the shop, on time and all in one piece !
Highly recommend Bill & Wag’s towing.<//text>

<Text>Shady business both in practices and services. Staff is beyond RUDE and provide very little information even when asked direct questions. Basically they treat people like we are nothing more than cash cows and frankly it disgusts me to no end that there are businesses that profit off the misfortunes of others, especially when it is through no fault of their own.

And it has no bearing if it is due to clerical error on the part of the Police Department that is contracted with them, seems all too "CONVENIENT" to me.......Funny how there are NO consequences for mistakes made by "powers-that-be" but we SURE don't get off unscathed that's for certain.....< /Text>< date>

<text>Terrible.
Got in at 10:15am, clutch fan would not come on causing overheating. I was assured that it will be completed in about two hours It is now 5:30pm, the issue has not been resolved. The manager told me that they would work on it and get done with it within couple of hours (of course at after hours rate) as the part has arrived late... The whole day wasted. Waste of money. BEWARE OF THESE SCAMERS.

P.S. They've been in business since 1971 (the sign says so) but were not busy at all (I was the only truck they were working on), now I know why....</text>< Response>

They were me as most tow companies go. Pointed out my faults and what I should do to prevent from happening again.  Manager told me if I wanted my money back I could take him to small claims court. Tow was unwarranted but it was my condo's patrol error. Got my money back from them!</Text>

<Review>Car side window broken overnight by someone couldn't think straight; empty car with no tinted windows. Person broken the window even left blood all over inside the car besides the mess.
This is the first business I contacted (not the only business) and sticked with. It took 4 days before they got the window glass in-stock due to covid supply chain issue (strange time indeed) which is common these days no thanks to certain officials people elected imposing incentivizing policies to criminals.
From Mr. Ramirez who answered my call to Alex dealing with my frustration on the next 4 days up till Jose the technician working on my car, this will be the group of professional I would call to have my car window replaced again. Hopefully in a distance future, yet seem imminent base on this wonderful climate of "soft touch" sensitive all-behavior welcoming environment. For the one hour which I watched Jose worked on the car, he seems know exactly what he is doing. The window glass was replaced quick, smooth after door panels was carefully and methodically taken down. He even make sue there was no shatter glass debris before put everything back. Mobile service, reasonable price. New window glass. Happy customer.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I Called and scheduled for the next day installation with a 3 hour window!  The day of installation, Henry called to verified the time that he would be there and showed up on time. He was a pleasure to meet, he definitely knew what he was doing.  I watched a pro in action, he explained what he was doing and why.  This is where he shined, we have a salvaged F250 Crew cab that was leaking water over the driver side.  When he removed the old windshield and reveled why it was leaking.  The roof was slightly bowed from the original accident and instead of the original shop repairing it they just applied sealant in the rather large gap which over time began to leak and rust.  Henry cleaned up the old mess and applied a primer to the area, sealed the holes the rust left  and installed the new windshield!  After which he had me spray the area with water and checked for any leakage.  With non found he cleaned the entire area and reinstalled everything back to original!  Needless to say I am very pleased with the job, Reyes Glass group and the installer Henry.  Would I recommend them, YES, in a heartbeat - GREAT JOB, and thank you for making this a great experience!< /text>

<text>Where do I begin? It was a long day dealing with my insurance company trying to get a claim going to fix 5 of my windows to my car. Towards the end my insurance company decided to go with a well known company, however, the wait time was a week! With my husband and I having jobs at conflicting hours we cannot share one car waiting on this one to be fixed. I looked up windshield repair near El Segundo and this company was the first one I reached. The service from the get go was superb. I reached Eddy and he took care of me was able to get me scheduled for the following day, then like that he was able to get me emergency service and got a guy out to me within 2 hours. The car was in a time limit active towing parking lot and no condition to drive it somewhere else, he saved us another hassle of having to tow it somewhere for the night. Then out of nowhere I was hit with another curve ball and my insurance company was closed so they couldn’t verify my insurance due to it being an independent company. But one of the owner reached out to me and helped me get service anyways! Then Antonio came and saved the day! He drove all the way from Anaheim off the clock to take care of all the windows. He was super fast and did a great job! Everyone I dealt with at this company showed true care and concern in the work they do to help people who need prompt service and just to get on with their life after dealing with an unexpected situation. They have became my #1 go-to for window repair and will be recommending them to everyone for service. Thank you guys for helping and saving our extremely long and stressful day!< /text></record>

<Text>The communication with the business was fast and easy. They’re friendly and detailed as to what needs to happen. Antonio was fantastic! He showed up early (but called first to notify me with an ETA which is awesome)! He was very kind, professional and thorough. We will be using them for every glass incident we have, and recommend them to everyone!</Text><Response>None< /Response>< Rate>

I would highly recommend getting your automobile window replaced here. I walked out on a Friday morning to find somebody had smashed in two of my windows. I found Reye’s through my online research. Alex was extremely helpful, this was the only place where I felt like I was not being taken advantage of.

The technician Jeff came to my house, he called and gave me his real time ETA, cleaned out all the broken pieces, replace my windows. In and out within the hour.

Their prices are unmatched and you will get a Grade A customer service.<//text>

<username>Ryder Gardner< /username><review>First, the windshield replacement was easy to schedule via text. The technician called ahead of our scheduled time to let me know he’d be arriving in 20-30 minutes. He was right on time, explained the process, told me the final cost for my windshield replacement and how long he would need. He got right to work and was done about 30 minutes later. He was friendly, knowledgable, and efficient.< /review>< Time>

The service was good, but beware about making payments over phone.. best is pay in cash.. I got the service done , which was very good but after a few hours, I see a $2000+ transaction on my credit card. I am not sure how secure their payment system is. I got it cancelled by calling the credit card company and they replaced the card.<//review>

This has by far been the best company I have ever dealt with. From customer service wise on timely matter To outright professionalism all around. I’d give them 100 out of 10 any day and I got them off of Google wasn’t even a referral you guys will take care of you more than you’ll ever see coming. I highly recommend choosing on your own wisely but there’s no way around it that they make you feel like family. And did I mention they are the best pricing by far out there. Again thanks Eddie and the guys, Henry for being amazing and just wanted to share my 2cents (way more than 2 cents).< /text>

Spoke to Eddie at their Houston office; he was quickly able to help my problems with my windshield. They sent their installer and we’re able to complete the work at my daughters work where the car was parked. They found the area of the windshield that was rusted through that was causing rain water to leak into the vehicle. The technician was able to clean the rusted area and applied a primer over this area that was rusted and explained this would help prevent more rust and allow the glue for the windshield adhesive to do it’s job of keep air and water out of the vehicle.  The technician did his work quickly and was very efficient, I would recommend Reyez Glass Group to anyone needing glass removal and replacement.

Thanks again guys, another job well done!

<review>My daughter had used this service for her OEM windshield replacement at home in the past, and had good results. Time came for my windshield replacement, I got estimates for after-market glass and install and they were in similar price ranges. I decided to go with Reyes Glass Group based on my daughter's experience. Jesus kept me informed of arrival time, replaced windshield, and let me know work and seals were covered under lifetime warranty. He was professional and friendly. Would recommend them to family and friends. I did have the option for OEM windshield but was too expensive.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce1ef6edf0ff9:0x5204cf007424fbe7<//Gmap_id></record>

Overall, My experience with Reyes Glass Group ended up being good. The scheduling? Not so much. I was told by the scheduler that my windshield would be repaired the following day, first thing in the morning. That would have worked out great for me, it wouldn’t have impacted my personal schedule like it ended up doing. The tech told me he realistically wouldn’t make it out to my workplace until late in the afternoon. If this would have been communicated to me early on, I would have been okay with it. The tech called and rescheduled for first thing the next morning because he thought it would be too hot to do the previous afternoon. I agreed and he showed up first thing the next morning and replaced my windshield without incident. Other than the late communication of changing the installation time for the work to be done, I am happy with the result. Next time let me know what’s going on in advance!</text>

<Text>I was staying in Austin and working in a town about an hour west. A vandal broke my driver’s side rear window by throwing a rock through it. The weather was 45 degrees and raining so I had to get the window replaced ASAP. Reyes Auto Glass was the third company I called after starting with Safelite. No one else could do the job in the timeframe I needed but Reyes said they could be there the next morning and they were as good as their word. The technician was professional and texted me twice to coordinate time of arrival. He did an excellent job in a timely manner. I hope this never happens to me again but if it does I’m calling Reyes Auto Glass first.< /Text><username>Informed Consent<//username>< Resp>

I needed to replace my windshield ASAP I’m about to take A long trip and was worried that I wasn’t going to be able to fix my windshield on time; so I went straight to google and I was in a mission to find the right place to go and have my windshield replace
First number I called I was confirm they had my windshield in stock and I was ask kindly If was interested in setting a appointment for the replacement, I was a bit hesitant due to I really like to do my research and compare prices but Alex was so kind and keep me updated in confirming my windshield was in fact available and Quote me a great price, so I was sold and we confirm appointment for the next day; two technicians arrived to my home and replaced my windshield and I was shocked! the work was done in matter of no more then 30 minutes.
this guys deserve 10 star absolutely safe me from stressing and calling different places. I’m absolutely grateful 🙏 Thank You Alex and unfortunately didn’t get the names of my two technicians but thank you guys for the great Job!
I’ll will Recommended with family and friends.< /Text>

<review>I have a high end luxury vehicle that I did not trust letting just anybody work on.  Neither did I want to pay the outrageous prices the dealership quoted me when my car was broken into and I had to replace my drivers side door glass.  A friend recommended me to Reyes Auto Glass Group and I was amazed by the entire experience.  They came to my home the very day after I called and were done in about an hour.  When I inspected the job I could not tell that the car had ever been broken into.  They removed all the glass out of the door frame and floor boards, replaced all the door panels exactly like they came out of the factory and were completely understanding of my attention to detail.  Thank you for a job well done.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

I called Al to see if they could replace my windshield and he had someone out to my apartment complex in a couple of hours.

The technician was on time and quick in his work, he was done in about an hour.

The windshield looks great and the process from beginning to end was hassle free. Definitely recommend and will absolutely be calling these guys again for future needs.</text>

< Review>
This was one of the few "found on-line" transactions that has left me 100% satisfied. My call (1st time) was answered by a live-person who was able to provide all the details of what services were offered, what my best options were, negotiate an "agreed upon price" and set an almost immediate appointment...... all without placing me on hold or transferring to someone else. I was impressed!

Almost as impressed as I was by the the two techs who called in advance and showed up on time. They were knowledgeable, personable and professionalism. They pointed out areas of concern, answered some of my nosy questions, were fast and efficient (didn't waste a minute of my time) and had my vehicle looking like it should!!! All this and I never had to leave my home / driveway.

Take this from someone who does not typically do on-line surveys for work / services that are done as they should be.... this was a 1st class transaction and the service was executed and accomplished above and beyond what was expected. A+ rating in my book. Call these guys!!!</Review>

<review>I called Reyes Glass Group at 0730 to get a quote. Quote was great, no crazy pricing. Then they were able to schedule me in the same day!
They came in the scheduled window gave me an hour to meet them at home, and finished fast with no issues. They gave themselves an hour window to complete the job, but they way they operated it was efficient. The gentlemen that worked my car, knew exactly what they needed to do. I will definitely recommend Reyes Glass group.<//review><Time>1580852610875</Time><pics>None</pics>< rating>

I contacted Ken regarding getting my windscreen replaced because of a crack.  He was very precise about the information he needed in the form of pictures and was able to schedule a next day appointment for me.  He gave me a window in which I would be contacted to let me know when the technician would be on his way.  I received a call during the window to let me know somebody was an hour away,  he showed up on time with the correct parts.  Job was done in 45 minutes with no inconvenience to me.  I worked the entire day and was on conference calls when the tech called and showed up and was able to juggle both obligations with nobody being the wiser 😀

It was a seamless operation.  Appreciate the ease of doing business with Ken.  Would be happy to recommend Ken in the future.</Text>

Reyes Glass group saved me. Not only was the staff very knowledgeable, professional and friendly they were also very efficient. I had to get the windshield replaced on my son’s 2015 Nissan Rogue and Alex helped me out a lot. He broke everything down and made sure I understood. They are an all around great company. The technician was on time. When he arrived he explained what he was going to do and informed me of the do’s and don’ts after the job was finished. He was friendly, professional and quick. The prices were great compared to everyone else who quoted an arm and a leg. I would definitely recommend this company for all your glass needs. Thank you Reyes Group. I appreciate all you did to make sure I was completely satisfied.< /Text>

They came very earlier than they had said! This was great because I get off early from work. The glass was super nice on my car and extremely clear and of good quality. My tech was SUPER nice!! He asked for me name and made sure he called me by my name. He transferred all my sticker tags and made sure everything was easy. It was super painless. They came right to my job so I didn’t have to miss work. Their customer service was super nice!!! And friendly and patient!! Just send pics of your car with the info and they quote you and come right to you!< /Text>

I only had a small budget to work with but I am lucky enough to drive a nice car. Ken at Reyes Auto Glass Group helped me to find a windshield I could afford and they came out the very next day and installed it. I would definitely use these guys again for any Auto Glass repairs. Thanks so much. I appreciate it guys.</review>

<Review>Great place to get your glass fixed. Willing to work with me especially being a single mom with low funds they gave me a GREAT price which I deeply appreciated!! They come to you , fixed it under an he in my driveway. I got to watch the whole process. The techs joked around with me and my boyfriend very friendly bunch and explained whatever questions we had pertaining to the process. I would go here again and refer all my friends to come here too. Great customer service wonderful job!!!<//Review><UserId.>110378653120476830626<//UserId.>< Pictures>

Shattered my rear windshield on accident today and needed immediate service. Called Alex with Reyes Glass Group and scheduled the glass to be fixed asap. Professional and caring to my situation. I'm very pleased and recommend this company to all. Thank you Alex.</Review>

<Review>I woke up to a smashed window in the rear of my car. I was devastated as you could imagine as most similar occurrence. I found a glass company repair but the earliest available appointment is not until August 10. I stopped some more online and was very blessed to stumble on Reyes Glass Auto. David the phone rep. was very polite, patient and helpful. Right away he gave me the next day appointment. The price quote was unreal, 50% less than the previous quotes! Antonio the technician called before showing up and went to work right away. In 30 minutes the job was done!! He vacuumed my car thoroughly and explained the type of tinted glass he was replacing. Another feature of this great discovery, was I texted the office to ask if it would be possible to pay extra to be bumped up to the technician's list and David texted back saying the technician will.call me back. Within 10minutes I got a phone call from.David saying he will arrive in 15minutes. At the end of the service, Antonio thanked me and said the office will get ahold of me to obtain my credit card information over the phone. This is one of those rarity relational service company that lives up to their standards and values. VERY IMPRESSED & GRATEFUL!! 5 Star Rating!!</Review>< pics>

<Text>Ken ordered a new front windshield for my 2007 Lexus convertible and had it installed within three days. The weather in Texas was constant rain so We made arrangements for the windshield to be installed in my garage. Everything went smoothly so now I can pass state inspection before I get a ticket. Many thanks to Ken !<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Called this morning for an estimate and was given a very reasonable price to fix my windshield for my BMW. Alex was very nice and informative and was able to get my windshield fixed the same day 2 hours after talking to him on the phone. His coworkers came and finished the job in 45 min !!! They did an amazing job and I will definitely refer them to my  friends and family members. Again thank you so much for the quick fix and exceptional customer service!!!</text>

<review>Really good experience! Called in for a quote and Lexy answered right away, she asked a few questions about my Jeep and gave me a what I felt was a fair price based on two other auto glass shops I called.

The windshield replacement technician by the name of Antonio came out to my home to replace my Jeep windshield with the original Jeep windshield. The process didn't take for than 45 minutes.

When he was done Reyes Glass Group charged my credit card for the auto glass service and emailed me the receipt and warranty.

I'm a happy camper!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>My windshield sustained a 2-3 foot crack along the bottom edge on my way to work at 6am.  Contacted Alex and had an appointment by 6:30am for a time slot between 1pm and 5pm.  I contacted Alex again approximately 30 min later after finder a slightly cheaper price elsewhere which he gladly price matched for me.  His guys called me at 1130am and said they could be there by 12 noon if I wanted to get the job done early.  They arrived at 12noon and were finished before 1pm.  All parties involved were very friendly, I would recommend them highly.  Thanks guys!</review>< pictures>

During these very difficult times, I found Reyes Glass Group to be very professional, and the tech was practicing safety, by wearing a face mask, gloves. My Dad has used this company in the past and told me to call them, I'm really glad I did. Alex gave me a quote over the phone, I also paid over the phone when the job was completed. They provided free mobile service so I didn't have to wait in some waiting room in a shop.
Thanks,

Fast and easy! I called and got a quote Saturday morning and they showed up several days later at the time they said they would and fixed my car window in about 20 minutes. I liked how consistent the company was in keeping me updated on things, such as confirming appointment times and location, and the techs called/texted me as well letting me know when they were coming. Overall very convenient for me. I just received my receipt in my email. I’ll hopefully never need their services ever again, but I’d definitely call them again if necessary.<//Review>

Faster than fast. Told me theyd be here at 11am and were right on time. Not a min early or late.
Then they finished in less than 30 min.
All while staying socially distant. A++

I needed a new windshield and these guys were there right on time and for the right price. I especially appreciated the responsiveness and knowledgeability of their sales representative on the phone. Many thanks again, Ken!!! Keep up the good work!< /Text>

<Text>These guys did a great job! I called at 1:30 to get my side window and windshield replaced and they showed up to have it repaired at 5:00! They were also $70.00 cheaper than the first place I called! Highly recommend!</Text></record>

Very happy experience. I called on a Saturday afternoon, and they came on Monday. The only reason for 4, not 5 stars is there was broken glass all over the inside of the car. I thought they would have had a hand vac and cleaned it. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied. The new windshield looks great!</Review>

I had never had to deal with replacing a window for my car before.  After my window was smashed when my car was broken into, the guy at Reyes Auto Glass walked me through the entire process. They came to my work the very next morning and my car looked  like new again when they were finished.  Thanks again for making it simple for me.</text>

I coukdnt find antbody to come out ti fix my window when my car got broken into whime on vacation.  I found Reyes Auto Glass group online.  They answered the line right away and 10 minutes later i was back to my vacation.  They came out the next day and by the time they finished you couldn't even tell there had ever been any damage.  I am also pleased with the life time warranty.  Nice to know somebody still stands behind their work.< /Text>

Reyes Glass Group is a class act! Fantastic service from start to finish! I called for a quote early Friday morning. Alex was very friendly & knowledgable.  I was able to send pictures of the damage directly. He gave me options based on my make and model (BMW 320) and with my VIN called back within 15 minutes to get me a price quote. He also honored the Groupon and saved me a couple hundred! The best part? He was able to get a technician out to me same day within a few hours.

Antionio called to give me a 20 minute heads up and arrived on time. He introduced himself and shook my hand (very professional). He got to work right away. It took him and the other gentleman less than 1 hour. They made sure my sensor was placed properly and let me know when I could drive my car (few hours) and when it would be safe to wash it (tomorrow morning).

I highly recommend the Reyes team!<//text>

<Review>I don't do much work on my car and was intimidated by all the different quotes I received when my back window broke.  The kind gentleman who helped at Reyes Auto Glass Group took the time to explain my options and we're very priced.    The mobile tech came right to my house and we're finished in less than an hour.< /Review>< Pics>

I was very satisfied with the service and front windshield replacement from Reyes Auto glass. I contacted them for a quote for my 2011 Honda CRV and received a very reasonable quote. The majority of communication was through text which was ok. They communicated consistently and a technician arrived at my address in Sacramento within a reasonable amoubt of time. He made it really easy and completed the work quickly. He explained what I meeded to do while the window set such as having a window cracked so pressure wasn't put on the window when I closed the door, etc. The windshield looks great!! They were a great choice!< /Text>

Company reps were quick to reponse to a broken window that needed to replaced before it rained that night since it had a hole in it.   It was done in 3 1/2 hours and feom when I called the price was fair and resonable.  I would recommend anyone that has an issue with their windows call to get an estimate.  Thank you to management and to the techicians that did the work.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Post Pack and Ship had the daunting task of packing up and shipping out a very old very tall grandfather clock to me in Indiana.  They took their time and built a specific crate just for this clock and packaged everything up so well that it got to me all in one piece and in perfect order. I want to thank Tom and his team for their efforts in doing this monumental task. This place is an awesome place to do business with. Thank you again Post Pack and Ship.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Tom and his team were great shipping the item from the Auction House to me. His store used a lot of packaging material to safe guard my precious antique. And if there is any problem or misunderstanding you get an answer/resolution within 24 hrs, like it happened to me.< /text>

I called to inquire about packaging an auction won item. Rick at Treasureseekers auction was kind enough to remove the print from the frame. All I wanted was to pay to have it packaged, and provide my own shipping label, leaving me in control of any unforeseen events, i.e. loss, damage, etc. as I have done many dozen times before with other items I have won at auction. I received a return email, "Sorry.  We don't use outside labels." Wow, a packaging store that will not package your item unless they can print their own label and charge you more than the shipping actually cost? Correct me if I am wrong. Isn't a packaging store in the business to package your items? Read the reviews and you will know why. They pad the actual shipping cost.<//Text>

WARNING DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!! we recently lost a family member and sent a care package with sentimental and emotional gifts to our extended family. I mention this as it’s been two months and our package was never received. I contacted this company with a tracking number for reference and they refused to assist me further accused me of calling the wrong number and hung up on me abruptly. Shocked I was hoping to give them the benefit of the doubt and called the number back the same man answered the call who claims to be the owner and manager of the store and yelled at me with profanity and told me not to call and this is not the shipping company and to call another number. Unbelievably unprofessional, appalling and disgraceful.</text>

Do NOT use this service. They try to scam you by quoting rates that are double what is listed on their site.
I am in the unfortunate situation of being outside of the country and need to get my package but they are refusing to help find a cheap mailing solution. I do believe they’re profiting off of whatever prices they quote. Check their other reviews for reports of price gouging. I took it upon myself and found a cheaper mailing option and they refuse to use it for reasons that are unclear to me (scammers?) Customer service is also terrible, with the person I’ve been talking to writing in all caps, basically yelling at me with no provocation. Use at your own risk.

Edit: I think I am dealing with the old man mentioned in the other reviews. This person is mentally unhinged and I’m not exaggerating.< /review>

Today I walked in to the Post and ship as I have others times. Usually I’m greeted by a Really nice girl well mannered or a few times by an older Gentelman same great attitude. Never a problem. Today was the exception Super Rude individual .. I asked him if I could be help with shipping a package off the bat he was Extremely rude. I didn’t appreciate his tone and called him out on it. After I told him I needed to Mail something to Hong Kong he lost it and said that there was a lot of restrictions and It couldn’t happen. I was calm and asked if he was frustrated, he was honest and said yes.
I don’t mind this place at all but he was a douchbag ..I’m Not the one imposing restrictions to China dude..</review>

Simply fantastic. I've been using Post Pack & Ship for a good 10 years, through 2 different owners, and have found it invaluable. The people running it are nimble, courteous, accountable and professional. Never had a lick of trouble there, and have seen the proprietors handle difficult customers with grace and ease. They've sent hundreds of packages for me, never with an issue, stamped documents as notaries, managed my PO box and given me excellent shipping advice when asked. Honestly, I can't say enough good things about the place. The new owner has improved it even more by adding faster technologies and fresh services. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed. I plan on using them as long as I use mail/messenger services. Chip Jacobs, author.</Text>

Rudest owner/customer service ever. Tried to pick a UPS package, not only he refused to give the package to me, he also cursed me with F Word many times.  I ended up getting my package under the help of an police officer and official UPS employee. What a scumbag.

Please avoid this place if you can or one day you may run into such trouble as I encountered.

There is an official post office store in the same plaza, both of official UPS and FEDEZ stores within 200 meters. Go these places if you need. And if you have other affairs I believe you can find better place to go with reachable distance. Service in this place can ruin your day easily.

And to the owner of this store, Thomas Ma -please stop using fake accounts to rate 5 stars comment, This is awful and disgust me.

The 5 stars comment under user name "Thomas Ma" is the owner himself, and another 5 stars comment under  user name "Ashley Ma" is also his relative.

(Update) Respond to Thomas Ma:
I brought in all the supporting documents (utility bills) to prove the package belongs to me. You not only refused to check or try to help, but you started the conversation with cursing words immediately.

Also, the package had been sitting in your store over 7 days. I believe you have no rights to keep holding it, you could either give to the customer who come to pick, or transfer to official UPS storage/store, or return to shipper.

You are completely scumbag and liar. In our conversation, you told me you have already returned my package but later on you handed it to the UPS guy who came to the store, under the enforcement of police officer.

The incident happened around 4pm, which was under your business hour, you need to stop lying, the police officer has an record, and I believe your in store camera also recorded entire process.

One last thing, if you really placed picture of my face in your store, please remove it immediately, I have already agreed to not step in your store in future. And you have no right to do that.

I hope you think twice before replying me again or take further action. I am already in contact with lawyer and you are responsible for what you done to me and in future.

The best,< /text>

Got a Livescan done earlier today and it only took less than 10 minutes. It was $75 for the livescan plus the government fee which totaled $124. Very professional and helpful. I suggest to call in first before going, to make sure that the technician is in. He's usually in and out of the store. They also do printing, packages and they have P.O. boxes available.< /review>

I only rated a 1 star so I could write a review.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! DAVID DENIED ALL MY PACKAGES FROM UPS WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME - SAYING HE WILL ACCEPT PACKAGES FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED IT! I EXPLAINED I HAVE PACKAGES STOLEN OFF MY PORCH AND ITS A SERVICE PROVIDED THROUGH UPS.   - I have notified UPS of his disrespectful,  rude customer service and refusal to accept packages from UPS customers.  although I doubt David even cares!!!!!<//review>

For Drop off, print your label at home. Because in this office they printin lable on regular paper, black/white and charge for that 3,5$! So any other information for print in same machine and same paper costs 0,15$ but any shipping label costs 20 times more! It’s not make sense to print 1 page by cost of 20 pages.
So I spend 7$ for printing two labels and feel very upset about that.
UPTADE
The owners is very polite and imideatly reselve the situation 👍🏼  and I hope this print price will be the same, high or low.😀
Will use this place again for send documents.</Text>

<Text>I rented a mailbox at this location for a year.  The owner is rude to me nearly every visit, complained about the number of packages I received, and literally yells at customers on occasion.  I have no idea how he stays in business when he treats customers this poorly.  I will never go back to do business at this location.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Pretty reasonable prices and most of the guys here take a lot of pride in what they do and you'll always come out with a super clean car.

I personally would not do high end detailing here as I'd have someone come to the house to do that, but if you need a wash, some decent mid level detailing then this is the place to go. Staff and everyone are super friendly, not too much on the upsells.<//text>< Pics>

Pretty good wash. Fast considering how much they did and very very nice people. Cheap if you come early but getting a hand wax really kicks up the premium. The waiting area is very nice and they have ample seating, including one of those  big time serious massage chairs. I have to admit I was amazed at how smoothly they got cars through when everyone else in the area takes forever and doesn't really appear to have enough space for the amount of business they are handling.<//text>

<text>I paid $160 for a full detail and welp there it is.
It so hard to find a  great car wash with good work ethic and final product! They're good at selling the highest cost. Just can't deliver the final product. 😤👎</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm9TVnHpUfm1CpD8Uj-C4vBmder_zdaqJZn14=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgjspP_P5xk2LVHafLIPBcAFGmfXszdyVJimw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzK8yyKL1b5ceXrbcFQ2ARzplzSMDtJUK0SCM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3vgkzYdRVrNJA4Il0p9jhbkMix6YOVahxs-k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw91M4Y38eSnLiSmq-bOmcMyt2-y99lySfXFY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN097XbbEPBf4PAA8_ziTr_GvU4RiNGbMwPRN0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUnRrTXbGFM9F3O-OvsmRYqWD07iW8eH63NeM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7EByQpvdHywBjbdpm01e4oCtWLNYACL3uck8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQnvvBkwJoxZPLp6HB8v6yTMb9IAT00UKciZI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqie_A_wjIqmOaEKwW_f7ahJj4TIARu6YppM8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnhQZgQfeio-6MaT0InPnb8JYKmuTJrp2OZRw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

No matter which package I take and how much I pay, I am unfortunately never happy. They always over promise. I've been tempted to go back again and again because it is so close to my house, but that's it - won't go back again.<//review>

TERRIBLE! The owner Raffi is so rude and disrespectful towards customers. I don't understand how this place is even in business. His employee broke the covering that covers the seat tracks in my car. No one told me. I found out the next day once I opened my back car door and saw it there on the seat. I called back to speak to the manager. He was so RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL and took no accountability. Raised his voice at me and started blaming me for what happened and then proceeds to say "it happens all the time." I went for a simple car wash. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY and go else where. He's overpriced, rude and can not deliver a simple car wash. If I could give this place 0 stars I WOULD!</Review>

<text>Great service. Raffi is very accommodating and gave me a good deal. However, before i left i found out that one of my sunglasses was missing. The guy who cleaned my interior must've forgotten to return it. Good thing it's still somewhere inside their shop and gave it back to me.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c297ea7a0e9cf3:0x927ce25163de56a3< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>*CHECK YELP REVIEWS FOR A BETTER PICTURE OF THIS PLACE- I am pretty sure these Google reviews are mostly fake* I have no idea how this place is still in business after you see all the negligence and damage they have done to vehicles. For years I avoided this place, because of the horrible reviews they have on Yelp. They are literally around the corner from my home so I went a couple times in the past few months without issue. Today I took my brand new car for a wash. I literally drove on block straight to the car wash and nowhere before that today. After I got my car back and drove down the street I saw that my tire pressure monitor came on. I looked and found a bolt sitting inside my tire. The chances of this not occurring within the car wash are literally less than 1%. Of course, they made excuses that the bolt "looks driven on, it doesn't look new". They told me to go to their other location (the chevron gas station in Encino, which interestingly I've gone to for nearly 10 years with almost 0 problems), I went all the way there only for them to say they can't patch the tire. It's quite clear this place has 0 ethic to handle their mistakes and issues, and once again, I am lost as to how there is not an entity that is forcing them to close, after it is clear they have caused problems for this many people.

<review>A great car washing experience.  They did an excellent job on my interior, fair price, and the store inside has quite a large selection of various air fresheners and cleaning supplies for your car, along with a boat load of other little things for impulsive buying.  Would recommend!<//review>< pics>

Be sure to have a 5 spot for the guys who hand dry. If you forget cash an ATM is inside, or better yet you can ask for cashback when paying with a card.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< rating>

I live a couple minutes away, I think these guys do a great job in comparison to other hand car washes around. I am a very picky guy when it comes to cleanliness, but they are good. Also, they have an offer for early birds who come before 10am 👌<//review>

I felt it important to support a local family owned business. Turns out, they don't care about their customers. If you have a problem or question, the owner/manager verbal assaults you. He is aggressive, argumentative and apparently a fortune teller. He can tell you the past! Maybe he might want to invest in that business because running a car wash and taking accountability for your actions is NOT something that he is interested in doing. DON'T TAKE YOUR CAR HERE FOR ANYTHING.< /review>

<Text>Pretty good car wash. The owners management try to sell you on a higher/more expensive service than you need so just beware. Early bird special is great and the workers doing the vacuum and cleaning are pretty good. I was in and out in under 30 minutes but you could be waiting a while if they have a rush.

As I complained at the wait time. He proceeded to tell me that it takes 30-40 minutes for a regular car wash. It was Monday and there were open lanes. To the point...I think my complaining got my car seriously scratched in TWO places. I noticed these Wednesday (so I cannot go back.) The scratches are major.

Don't use these guys, they damage your vehicle, and then don't take responsibility for it. They lost my spare set of keys and refuse to be responsible, they broke my windshield wiper and refuse to be responsible, they offer horrible service. And then their excuses they've been doing this for 30 years, and everybody lies to them. That's how they get out of it.<//review>

I had some jewelry stolen out of my car here just recently which is really disappointing because I was taking my car to get washed here about twice a month for the last year. When I brought it to their attention they said "they don't take responsibility for their employees taking things out of people's cars". What kind of business operates under the condition that they don't take responsibility for their employees..??

The funny thing about it is that they tried to make it seem like I misplaced it or maybe it wasn't there to begin with, but when they called over their employee who vacuumed my car in the beginning, he confirmed that the jewelry was there when it went through to get washed. So it disappeared between getting vacuumed and me getting my car back... but "they don't take responsibility for that".

I do understand and partiality take responsibility for leaving something valuable in my car to begin with.. I know that was stupid, but I completely forgot about it. I noticed it was missing as soon as I got back in my car and when I brought it to their attention the older man up front wanted nothing to do with me. He called someone else over who was much more polite and seemed a bit more understanding, but still no response even after returning the next day to check in.

Generally I am a very loyal costumer and continue doing business with the people who treat me well. This is not that place. So unless you enjoy being stolen from, and treated as an inconvenience I wouldn't recommend ever coming here.< /text>

I received an email saying they have a free car wash from May 8th - May 10th. I went all those days trying to get the free car wash, but they were closed! This is false advertisement as they didn't even specify a time frame from when they would be open until outside of what it says on their time open according to Google maps.</text>

This is my local car wash I come to in Sherman Oaks. The service is always fast and the employees are very friendly. My car is always vacuumed and very nicely cleaned.  My car comes out sparkling clean!  I had to give this place five stars!  I would definitely recommend it!< /Text>

I asked for a hand wax for $80. The attended suggested I do a clay wax for $110. I agreed.
They didn’t even remove a big splatter from my bumper! What kind of wash leaves that behind? This is place is only good for a regular express wash. NEVER get the additional services here.< /Text>

Best car wash around!  Meticulously hand dried and wiped sparkling clean.  So glad I found them.  Was reluctant to go because of the reviews.  Believe me, this is the car wash you will appreciate!< /text>

An employee got upset with me for moving my car into the wrong area for the Express Wash. I felt pretty disrespected & approached management which lead to more heated discussion than I was looking to have. The spat ended in a dismissal “it doesn’t matter, what do you want me to do? Punish him?”

The express was pretty fast though, 2 star.</Review>

<Review>A car wash should get your car clean. Right? Well, apparently if you're Sherman Oaks Car Wash, the answer is No. The three times I went here, here, I've left with windows that are misty and streaky. Every single time I've had to re-clean the windows myself.

Fashion Square Car Wash, just a bit down the road, is far superior. Their prices are lower, they have coupons on their web site to save even more, and they're right off the freeway--very convenient for when you're coming or going. So go there.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I have never had any issues in 10 years. A full van detail service takes a reasonable (4.5 hours) for my Toyota Sienna, they will give you a ride home, so you don't need to wait. I am sure I could save a few bucks going another car wash, but I know this one does great service, at fair price. My 5 children can cause a serious mess, but now the van is almost showroom new and my wife is happy. I think next time I am going to ask if they can clean my baby car seats?< /Review>

I've been taking my car here for several years and never had any problems with the quality of the wash and the cleaning of the interior - for the price they do quite a good job.  The service guys aren't the friendliest lot but I've found that if you're friendly to them they'll usually respond well.  Their system is pretty speedy even when very busy (~20 min), so overall it's a good place to go for a quick wash.</text>

Went to them a few times, paid well, tipped well, last time I went, one of the employees stole valuables out of my glove box, they denied it and said they had no liability for lost or stolen items. Will never be going back, I even called and spoke to the manager, very sneaky and unprofessional staff. No integrity</Review>

Great job detailing, though terrible at taking cars in the order they come. I literally was bypassed by 12 cars in am. Rather than accommodating they were combative, frankly don't need that on my weekends. Tried it again today - bypassed by 5 before they took my car. Sigh. Nice job, but make sure you have a ton of time to waste. Friendly service 1/10<//Text>

<text>I don't know what happened to this place.  Used to be a great spot for a quick exterior wash.  Always did a great job and you couldn't beat the price. Just left there and I watched 3 cars go through the wash process and none of them got a pre-rinse before the employees started in on the mitts to scrub the car!  Talk about a good way to scratch the paint!  Then to top it off, they drying guy didn't even touch the back of my Prius.  Drove away with it soaking wet....that's the last time I'm going there....such a shame.</text>< Gmap_id>

My first time here but I love these places. You get a good exterior was and mostly dry The reason I prefer this to the full service places is that you also get free vacuum and a shaded place to clean out your interior.<//Review>

I hadn't been in months to this car wash due to the staff being quite unfriendly and pretentious, especially the cashier and the gentlemen who receive the cars. However, today I felt extremely uncomfortable given that two of their employees were fighting yelling and cursing at each other (well it was mostly one of them who was doing both the yelling and the cursing the other guy did not engage as much). But still nobody did anything about it and let everybody just watch and listen to the fight. I simply couldn't wait to get out of there as fast as possible. Plus they do a mediocre job with the wash!!</Text>

<Review>Not even sure yet how good the car looks or does not look but if it is as bad as the attitude is of the female taking the money - who was on her cell phone the entire time- and when asked a question she looked at me crazy and stated " maybe it is not working, I do not know what else to tell you - " it was about the massage chair that appears it works and It would not be a big deal- if she maybe did not answer so short- so she could continue her conversation on her cell phone. She thinks having a headset on makes it ok -I suppose. How about work behind a closed door if you can't have common courtesy when being asked a simple question.
I was very polite as well. And am super resilient and try not to take things personal. But the Car wash costs plenty of money and why not at least walk the lazy rear over and check it out. Just wow!😢😢😱
Then as I was leaving she is leaning across the counter shoving something in her face, amd still blabbing on the phone. 😱😱😱
This is out of character for me I have never left this bad of a review and it is sad. 😢
I came back to edit this because the guy who finished off my car worked quite hard to ensure it was looking good. Also I asked him to wait so I could give him a tip- then asked him about the girl inside and he smiled- I told him how she appeared and came across and wanted to be sure it was not just me. He said he hears it every day that she is this way. I reassured him that he did a great job and that I was sorry if I sounded mean - he told me it was nothing new about her. Then another nice man in a blue shirt (maybe the owner or manager) came over and approached me very calm and super concerned - he asked if everything was ok- because he thought maybe something happened and overheard me - this was very cool of him -- he not only made sure the guy cleaning my car was not put in a bad spot but he also seemed very concerned. I apologized and said that I am not someone to get all upset but that she makes the place have a bit of a bad feel. He told me I was nice and that he would address this - I am sure he did- I saw him walking right inside. I never have been one to want someone to lose their job- but anyone who chooses to work with the public- and I know it can be a challenge- but at a car wash? I mean she collects money and could at least be polite and not be talking the whole time on her phone while there is a customer there. Phew.
Any way I think they do a good car wash but that girl hopefully changes her tune a little. Poor thing just so miserable😢< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>I am very disappointed.
First the guy who gives your ticket have a BO
And I try to use my " 9.99" coupons, nope!!!
Is only for a 14.99 wash that coverts in to a 9.99 😏 So! It's a 9.99 coupon or a 5.99.
Not happy it all. Won't come back here ever.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c297ea7a0e9cf3:0x927ce25163de56a3<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>Horrible attitude!
The car was dirty, so they were very upset, and gave me lots of attitude.
I brought in my car becasue it was dirty, why else do you go to the car wash ;)
In the end I helped myself to the vacuum and did it on my own (I did pay for them to clean my car!....) they left the car a mess.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c297ea7a0e9cf3:0x927ce25163de56a3< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I go to the Sherman Oaks Car Wash weekly. Go before 10am, for a significant discount.  Quality is excellent.

Cleaning the car is a three stage process. First, the interior and trunk (boot) are vacuumed. Next, the exterior is sprayed with water, hand rubbed with soft, soapy gloves, rinsed, sprayed with liquid wax and blown dry.  Finally, the car is driven to the finishing area where its given a rubdown, inside and out. The windows are carefully detailed.

There are two wating areas, inside, which is air conditioned, and on the covered patio. Inside, you can view the cleaning process through large windows. Snacks, gadgets and greeting cards are available. Outside, you sit on a sun protected patio, in a comfortable chair, to watch the completion of the car's detailing. When the detailer finishes, he waves a cloth. Tips are appricated.

Expect a significent delay the day before a holiday.  Wheelchair accessible including bathrooms.< /Review>

Horrible attitude! They didn't vaccum my car right and I nicely complained, the two "managers" started yelling at me in front of my son! Very rude! Terrible service! Save your money! Plenty of better options in the area.<//Review>

< Review>
As I drove in and told them which wash I wanted they disagreed with me and signed me up for a more expensive option after driving off with my car. Then after waiting for over an hour I tip the worker $5 just to have him throw it back in my face and tell me that after working so hard on my car he deserves more. I think he expected me to then give him more. After all this my car was still not clean. Overpriced as well. Not recommended.</Review>

Amazing customer service! I accidentally showed up to my appointment the wrong day and Pepe was super helpful and even willing to deliver my exchange. Very convenient pick-up and the whole experience was great 👍 definitely recommend for anyone with a soda maker!</Review>

With the pandemic it’s been hard to procure CO2 canister replacements and seltzer cans just aren’t cost effective. Enter Fizz Fill. An awesome, local indie biz who knows what we all want— fizzy water for less $$. Just a few mins from our apartment in DTLA. We set a time via email, drove up, & they happily made the socially-distanced CO2 canister swap direct to our trunk. Excellent, friendly service with no lines, waits, or shipping fees. If you’re in town let Fizz Fill hook ya up!< /Text>< Pics>

FizzFill is simply the best! We've used the service 3 times now and it's very convenient. Much cheaper than the soda stream return service or going to target. We will be customers for life!<//Review>

I have used them twice. First time was all good. Good communication and it was smooth. So I decided to go back to them again. But this time was a totally different frustrating experience. I made an appointment and I was sending multiple text messages to them to let them know I was on my way. But nobody answered. I was in a bit of doubt, but I trusted someone will be there to handle my appointment. When I got there, at the appointed time, nobody was there. I texted multiple times, no replies. I called, nobody answered. I ringed the door, nobody answered. I emailed, no reply. I texted and call again, nobody replied. I was just there waiting for nearly 30 minutes. No reply, nobody came out, my appointment was totally ignored and no communication was possible.
About 3-4 hours later, I got a text from unknown number saying "Hi i dont know why but i get all the text together can you reschedule". There is no apology, no explanation about why nobody was there to communicate at the appointed time. He may received his text somehow all together later because cell phone carrier's fault or whatever, even it was true, he already had my contact information and he knew my appointment time. So if he should have been there for the appointment regardless.
Of course, as everyone else, I am a busy person. I drove to unfamiliar area (It was Inglewood pickup location) during my visit in LA, taking my limited time for this. I ended up being ignored, had an unpleasant experience and wasted my time and no soda bottles refilled.
It is not reliable. I certainly do not recommend FizzFill to anyone. Because Fizzfill is handed at the private resident, no store front to enter, no store person to talk to, cell phone communication is extremely important. If nobody answer the text, call, nor the door, customers are just stuck helplessly. If communication and appointment is so unreliable like this, never again! Only pros about this process was that they refunded with no question asked.< /text>

<text>I’ve used FizzFill about 4 times in the past 6 months and have had nothing but stellar experiences. They are friendly, communicative, and efficient. The first time I went, my pickup appointment was at 6:00pm and by 6:04pm I was headed back home with a trunk full of CO2! I feel very fortunate that FizzFill is in my  neighborhood. I would definitely use them even if they weren’t saving me money!<//text></record>

<review>Absolutely fantastic service. When I first ran out of CO2 for my soda stream,  I couldn't find refills anywhere for weeks, and the few I could find were $40+! When I stumbled onto Fizz Fill, I was skeptical because the prices were so reasonable ($12!), I thought it might be a scam. But low and behold,  it's REAL and a AMAZING. The pickup was easy, convenient, and COVID safe!! I stayed in my car, masked, and they handed it to me in a sanitary tub, and there was even a sanitary wipe stuck to the canister. Order on "thirsty Thursdays" to receive a discount!<//review>< username>

Excellent service and great value. During the early days of the pandemic it was really difficult to get Sodastream refills. so I was delighted to discover this company. Now I see no reason to go back to Sodastream for overpriced hassles. Love the new lockers by the way!</Text>

The perfect solution! I had a fizz machine in the past, and I could not find any place to refill the CO2. I finally gave up and just bought sparkly water. When I heard about FizzFill's ease of CO2 cartridge exchange, I finally took the Soda Stream plunge again. It was so easy and close to my house and economical. Very happy I found FizzFill!!!!!< /review>

< Review>
Like others who have posted, the business model surprised me but my experience was fantastic. I set up a time for the exchange, drove up and made the switch. So simple and so much cheaper than other options. Also, unlike Staples (which forces you to visit in person to see if they even have them in stock, which they never ever do) they always have them available. Thanks!!</Review>

Using Fizzfill was cheaper and easier than any other service I have used before for my canisters, at only $10 per trade-in. The contactless pickup was also great and they even attached sanitizing wipes to the canisters for extra safety. I will definitely be visiting them again.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Hard times spurs genius. FizzFill is a well-run business with a website so user friendly it's as if Steve Jobs created it. Easy-peasy process: Bring your empty tanks, and waiting for you are some full ones. Then you're on your way. And it's cheap! Don't pay $30 a tank from Soda Stream when you can re-fill the exact same tanks for a fraction of the cost. SO happy to have my bubbles back again!< /Review>< pictures>

I haven't been able to find a soda stream canister exchange at any of the "partner" stores or on the sodastream website in a month. I'm really glad I found this service! It was about a 20 minute drive for me to the nearest pickup location, but it was so easy and reasonably priced that it was well worth the drive. Thanks for the bubbles!< /text>

This is an incredible find, and I don't usually leave reviews.  It's a budding community business, a well operated system, and friendly people, what more do you need?  The cost is lower that the big box stores, the service is local to my neighborhood, I don't have to get all ready to be around a lot of people just to get my new tankfulls, It's ready when I get there, prepaid on Paypal, AND THEY'RE ALWAYS IN STOCK!!  I'll never go back to the old way again.< /review>

Easy, hassle-free exchange! Actually quicker and easier than going to one of the big-box places (if they even have canisters available!).
If you live near either of their locations, it's a no brainer!

<review>I am SOOOOO glad that my friend told me about FizzFill!  I haven't been able to exchange my SodaStream canisters since basically the start of the pandemic - every time I go to a store to do it, they don't have any in stock.  The FizzFill website is super easy to use and the process is really straightforward.  Plus the price is way better than what I used to pay in a store!  My on site contact was prompt and friendly and I didn't even turn off the car to make the exchange.  Will DEFINITELY be referring friends and will be a repeat customer for sure!

Well, this has got to be just about the weirdest business model ever. Make an APPOINTMENT to get CO2 refills? Pay in ADVANCE via PayPal??? Pick up your new tanks on a RESIDENTIAL STREET in Silverlake??? But you know, it all worked out perfectly, and at half the cost for refills that come by mail. Just part of the New Reality we're all coming to grips with with, I guess. Weird as it may be, zero complaints, five stars. Go for it.< /review>

<review>Extremely happy that I can get our Sodastream cylinders exchanged so nearby.  I found Fizzfill after exchanges online through Sodastream or any retailers usually providing the service were not available.  The price is also better, I can schedule an appointment, don't have to wait in line, and the exchange is completely safe.  The bubbles taste the same:)< /review>< Rating>

My family loves drinking sparkling water and I found out about FizzFill from an instagram ad.   The website and social media all looked legit, but I was still skeptical.  This family and WOC owned small business is great. Bed Bath and Beyond isn't swapping out canisters and we really missed our bubby water.  I took a chance and messaged them and they responded quickly, with clear information. And I set up a time to swap out 4 canisters. It was easy, felt safe, they used masks and made the process super quick and easy! We are getting our fix of sparkling water again 🙌🏽 so.... Thumps up!  I will be back when I need another swap.  Thanks Fizz Fill!  Happy to support neighborhood businesses!<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I can’t say enough good things about this company.

Our vehicle died on I-5 in the middle of a recent rain storm. We were luckily able to pull off to the shoulder, but worried about being hit because of the poor visibility.

You guys were the first search result on Google, and answered right away. Not only were the in-town rates better than your competitors, but the service was fast and professional and arrived in less than an hour.

I even used you guys again for moving the vehicle to a repair shop, and experienced the same excellent customer service the very next day.

With service like this, I would recommend your company to anyone looking for tow services in the Stockton area. Great job!</review><username>David A< /username>< GmapID>

<Text>DO NOT USE THIS TOW TRUCK COMPANY!!!!
I called them when my car broke down on the side of the freeway. It took them 50 minutes to get to me which was understandable (I guess) The guy they sent out to us on the side of the freeway refused to drive the car up the truck ramp. I plan on calling the supervisor and requesting their policy as that could have been a safety hazard if my husband was to fall off the ramp/truck on the side of the freeway. (I have video proof) He told my husband to do it again when we arrived at the auto shop. The tow truck driver said that he could do it again (I have video of my husband walking up the ramp and bringing the car down)

My thing is why am I paying $145 to do someone's job for services I requested and have to pay for if we have to do the work. The driver did nothing other then secure the car on the truck and drive ot to thw location.. I am very disappointed with City Wide Towing. I will not be using them and will be calling to speak to someone tomorrow.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I had a flat. I went down the Google list of local tow trucks. The ones that answered all said it would be a 2 to 3 hour wait. Got to City Wide and they had truck to me in 30 minutes. I was back on the road in less than an hour. Deanna was my driver. She was fast, professional, and friendly. City Wide Towing should be at the top of the Google list.<//Text>

We called to have our car towed and they were extremely rude! We called to verify to see if he was still coming and he said he called us 45 mins ago when we got no phone call of verification. He also stated he had cancelled the towing and if we wanted to argue about the services he can argue back!!!! TERRIBLE JUST TERRIBLE!</text>

<time>1559955393276<//time><userid>102288322132127387960< /userid><review>My car was stolen. When i got to the tow yard to pick it up after CHP recovered it, it was missing -headlights -K&N intake -radio -battery -the entire exhaust system (manifold, cat, muffler, tailpipe). The CHP report says at 10:00pm the officer stopped the car because the liscense plate didn't match the vehicle. So....the car was cruising down the road with no battery? No exhaust? Headlights? Ya, right. Citywide is a bunch of thieves. Also, I was unable to get my car for three days because citywide office was closed for 3day holiday weekend. They charged holding fees for all three of those days as well as the day it was towed...which was likely around 11:30 pm.</review>< gmapID>

<Review>Long story short....

Had a service appointment to be at by 8am.
Driver showed up at 7:50am.
Blamed dispatch for not telling him.
Dispatch acted like they could give a rat's ass about my situation but did give me a 10 dollar discount even though I lost 2 hours of work that highly exceeds their discount.
Payed with my credit card.
1 day later my credit card account was compromised for over $1000.
Informed "management".
Once again, dispatch acted like they could give a rat's ass about my situation.
Never again.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Love it..The guys running the store are great..They sell liquor, gas, fountain sodas and have an ATM..Got it all and have a winning attitude. The guys behind the counter always greet me with a personalized "Hello" and we negoiate deals on liquor..I go there often and will continue to do so!< /Text>

This review is for Henry Mercado.
I met Henry about 14 years ago in a Verizon store in Cupertino while dealing with a frustrating issue with my account. In a few minutes not only did he resolved the issue, but he was extremely empathetic . Henry's personality and professionalism has been the reason why we referred him, resulting in three other families going to him. When he transitioned to this new location we followed him. He is a kind person with a great heart ❤. He is dedicated to his career and understands the needs of his clients and looks after the image and impact of the company he works for. He is a humble and honest person committed to helping others without any prejudice. I have seen how other people enjoy doing business with him and how respectful he is to his colleagues.

Best Regards to Henry and his bosses.

< Review>
Wynn Vuong is very thorough In explaining the phone options and all that goes along with it. I felt very comfortable in asking her questions more than once if I didn’t comprehend the numbers and anything that had to do with trading in and upgrading my phone.  She very pleasant Ana made my visit worthwhile...<//Review>

<review>I am writing this to Ms. Wynn for her excellent customer service, patient and great knowledge of the service I have received the last two days. Ms.Wynn Vuong took time to explained and guided me throughout the process (I’m new to iPhone).😩
My husband and I are very happy and could not wait to start using our new iPhone 12, and we will be referring all our friends and family to Wynn.
👍👍👍👍

My sister and I came to the store in January 2021 hoping to get new phones. We were so lucky to meet with Wynn Vuong who supported us in changing new plans in order to be matching with our new phones. Wynn was really friendly, helpful, and kind.

We came back in March 2021 to meet with Wynn again asking for help to clarify our bills. It took only 20' for Wynn to call the customer services and clear our concerns.

We really appreciated the services Wynn has been providing.

Thanks,
Khanh Dang<//Review>

<review>This review is for Austin. Austin was extremely helpful and patient in helping me set up my new phone. He went out of his way to ensure my phone was working properly. It’s evident that Austin is knowledgeable in the technology department, as he was able to successfully back up my old device to the new one without any difficulties, as well as answer all of my questions. I would refer him to anybody in the market for a new phone or looking to transfer to Verizon. Thank you Austin! Your time and effort is very much appreciated.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

She has made the whole process of upgrading my and mom’s line and adding my fiancé’s line so quick and easy. We’re happy with our choices and staying with Verizon.

I rarely give reviews but I have to for Wynn Vuong at Verizon store in Eastridge mall, San Jose.  I came in with a problematic phone number that another sale associate couldn’t resolve previously.   Wynn took care of it within 15 minutes. I was so amazed at her superb knowledge and efficiency!  If you ever needed help with your phone, Wynn is the one to go to.  Thanks Wynn!!!<//Review>

I came in today because my Jetpack stopped working all of a sudden, and I could not seem to get it back on the network. I called Customer Care and they transferred me to Tech Support, but my issue remained. Thankfully, Wynn VƯỢNG was able to troubleshoot and got my device within minutes. I wish I had come to the store first and not wasted so much time on the phone. Thank you Wynn!!<//text>

<text>Appreciated the help Wynn Vuong has provided to my parents with their iPad today.  They came in twice before, but they didn’t understand the advantage of the $150 off and refused the deal.  But they wanted the new iPad, and today they finally bought one.  I’m very happy with the explanation we were provided and especially for my parents.</text>< pictures>

<response>None<//response><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I have been a Verizon customer for more than a decade (almost 2) and I have always liked the service and our plan. I have been to this location many of times over the years and have always had a good experience but on Saturday, January 18, 2020 I had the BEST EXPERIENCE with Flex. He not only helped me with a travel pass for my daughter who was traveling to India for 10 days but he helped me understand my bill and lower it by making a few modifications and changes! I got the updated phone I was due and I get to pay less each month than I had been for the past two years! Flex's level of expertise, professionalism and kindness was outstanding! I left there feeling good about being able to keep in contact with my daughter while she was out of the country and we never had a dropped call, missed text or any delay in communicating. Kudos to Verizon for their excellent coverage and a HUGE THANK YOU to Flex for easing my mind and making my monthly plan more affordable. FLEX YOU ROCK!</Review>< UserId.>

<review>This was my family's best experience at any Verizon store we have gone into years. The thought of a crowd and long wait annoyed us but when I arrived there were only a few people. We initially came for a new sim card for my cousin who traveled back to the states and Flex was the person who helped us. Flex insisted that we take a look out our current bill and Flex asked us if we understood the bill. We told him not entirely and he spent 30 minutes of his time explaining all the charges which was nice of him. My daughter asked him how much an iPhone would cost monthly and he brought out several papers to generate quotes by hand. The part that was fishy was when he told us he could upgrade 3 of our phones and give us a new iPad and our bill would decrease but we were interested even though the sales people are tricky. Flex told us he was different which they all say but he really was different. He showed us our future bills from the Verizon app before we left the store and we were amazed how correct his math was with taxes without using a calculator. Our bill dropped by $125 monthly and he continued to follow up with my family for two months making sure everything was okay which was nice of him.<//review>< userid>

We came here to upgrade my parents phone and met Irshad who greeted us well and explained everything very patiently to my elderly parents, he answered all theirs and my questions politely and took time to make us understand the promotions. He was very helpful and I recommend him if you are visiting the store. I will always be going to him whenever I need new phones. Amazing talent and a perfect person to have on the team. Awesome job team Verizon Eastridge</text>

Nothing but good things to say about this store from my personal visits to switch back from AT&T. After being very unsatisfied with AT&T’s mobile network service and customer service in store, I ended up walking into this Verizon retailer. Greeted and welcomed in by the very knowledgeable staff I sat down with Thomas to make the switch back to Verizon. I explained my situation to him and he assured me that everything I wanted to do in terms of switching back with the same plan, number, and zero fees would all be doable. After a mistake occurred on the phone due to the customer service representative that needed to be contacted to process the post payment account, he experienced a lot of trouble which ended up delaying the whole process by a day. I came in the next day on my lunch after my phone being disconnected prior due to my number being completely ported over, he continued to have trouble with the account through my whole lunch and asked me if I’d be willing to leave my phone and information in the “Notes” app on my iPhone. So I did, when I came back after work Thomas was waiting for me with a working phone, completely switched over on a post payment account and I was nothing but relieved to know that he was able to give me everything I was promised. Definitely an employee that will make you recommend his workplace to your friends and family.

-A Very Satisfied Customer :)</Text>

Han provided excellent service for my Mother and I at Verizon today. She was very knowledgeable and patient with us. Especially my mother, as she’s older and asks a million questions about how to do this and that on her new phone. She went above and beyond. She put on our screen protectors for us and helped us get them registered. She made the headache of transferring everything over to a new phone a lot less painful. Thank you Han for all that you do. You are an asset to the company and they are lucky to have you!< /text>

Ruth is amazing! I came in because my phone was acting up. She looked and spent time to diagnose and I had a iPhone 7 that was too old. So she helped me upgrade 2 phones at once. One where I forgot codes and passwords and one that was so big that the backup took so long. She did not rush me and completed that. I also had a lot of other things to ask and we completed after 4 hours! She was sweet, helpful, and so thorough. Best experience anywhere so far!<//review>

Came in looking to upgrade my line and a wonderful rep by the name of Travis helped me out. This gentleman is really knowledgeable about the products that are offered and helped pick out which one would fit my lifestyle. On another note he helped me save money on my bill by analyzing all the things that weren’t being put to use and making enough space on my bill to the point where all the junk I was essentially paying for went towards a tablet!

I highly recommend stopping by! Their customer service is far beyond any other Verizon store I’ve been too :))</Review>

They have a phone at the store but they leave it off the hook so you can't call in.

Travis and DAN DAN are probably the best duo ever. Loved working with both of them. They are very knowledgeable of the phones and the plans. Make sure to ask for them, and if youre lucky you'd get the chance to work with them too. Absolutely love my new LG phone. I'm so glad they convinced me into getting it. Thanks again guys!!</Text>

Always get great help here. Been coming here for 6 yrs now for new or upgraded devices. I've only had one issue but this staff went out of their way to correct it. Been a Verizon customer for well over 17 yrs. I don't mind paying the extra $$ for reliable customer service and a shop like this one. Lance helped me out the last couple of times. I'll give his service 5 stars as well.</text>

This was my second visit here at Verizon and both times, Daniel, Robert, Derek, and Lance were extremely helpful!! Thank you to all four for the helpful information and for the assistance in purchasing my new phone, receiving more information as well as switching over to carriers. I wish I can give more than 5 stars! Thank you!!</text>

From past bad experiences with authorized retailers -- Lance went ahead and made sure I would be taken care of furthermore that I'm getting the best deal possible, transferring over everything that is important to me, and most importantly saving me money on my bill. I highly recommend coming to this store and getting your money's worth with their service!<//review>< Pictures>

I went in the other day to switch my family from sprint to Verizon and we had excellent customer service from Lance. He was able to explain the process thoroughly and was able to answer all my questions, and I had a lot. 10/10. Was really refreshing to see his welcoming and helpful attitude.</Text>

Jessica and Derek helped me out today and their customer service skills were absolutely on point. Jessica showed patience and kindess not only to me and the zillion questions I had, but also to Derek, whom she was training in the process. They let me try out the microphones on different phones, which was a very important feature for me, and they took the time to listen to my personal needs for the phone so as to match me up with the best option. Really, what stood out most was Jessica's attentiveness. She was very present, never giving the impression that there was a rush to another customer or to wrap up a sale. She and Derek really took the time to just be with me and talk about my options, which means a lot to me as I don't know much about phones and wasn't happy with my previous purchase.

The physical wave of relief as they handed me my new phone was too too real. They made my day and totally saved the rest of my week (from my shattered old phone) both on a professional and personal level. Best phone purchase experience EVER. Thanks a million, you two!<//Review>

I am writing to let you know how much I appreciated the service I received on Dec 7, 2018 when I entered your store (CCEL- San Jose Eastridge) to change my cell phone service from AT&T to Verizon and purchase a new cell phone.

Cecily Rodriguez greeted with a smile and was very helpful in guiding me through the process.  She was polite, attentive, and knowledgeable.  We discussed how I used my phone and what I wanted to be able to do.  Once she reviewed my current plan and knew what I was looking for, she was able to offer me a plan, equivalent to my current plan, at a lower cost.  She offered me a phone that met me needs and did not try to sell me the most expensive phone in the store.  She helped set up the phone and answered all my questions.  If she didn’t know the answer to one of questions, she found out the answer.  I was not forced into buying anything I did not want.  I left the store with a smile and her contact information so I could call her in case I had any questions.
I returned the following day to set up My Verizon Account.  She set up the account and answered any questions that I had.

I also want to share that all the Customer Service Reps, in the store, were very friendly and pleasant to talk to. They offered me water on both visits.  This was a great experience.  Thank you Verizon and Cecily for your GREAT SERVICE!  I will definitely return.</text>

Staff has been off and on at this location for years. I went in today and they changed the layout and staff. Love the layout and the staff was helpful and very knowledgeable. My cousin and I were helped by a very nice young woman with a new purchase. She pitched all 3 or 4 of the current IphoneX promotions as she should and understood that we weren't interested. I am glad to say this employee did not push us too hard which could always lead to an uneasy customer experience. Great job<//Review>

Came in here on a Sat morning needing help with my account and phone. I was greeted by Travis Bringas. He was super friendly! I was notified that I would have to pay extra for something, but after much research on Travis' part he was able to fix my problem with another solution, and I didn't have t pay. He could have easily charged me, but I liked his honesty, and helpfulness. I would come back again, and if you have a chance ask for Travis!</text>

<Text>TLDR: VZW phone support took 5hours to do what Travis was able to do in minutes. Come here for amazing customer service.

You guys. So I recently got a Pixel 3 XL and was having some troubles with completing the activation process. I've always done my own phone transfers and activations. And with the new Samsungs it was even easier so I'm not sure why I had issues. I called VZW customer support and I'm not sure where the miscommunication was but the kind lady on the phone told me I had to go in store to get a new sim card. I listened because we were both struggling at that point. 5 hours later we were still struggling so I decided to try a different Verizon store. The one closer to me was too full and low and slow on staffing so Eastridge Lp was my next best bet. You have no idea how it feels to see a familiar face, TRAVIS!!!!!. This good looking man used to work at your local Gen BBQ (multiple locations). You'll be happy to know those customer service skills have only gotten better over time. I was in and out of the store in less than minutes. It turns out the phone assist entered my sim incorrectly. He found the issue, fixed it, suggested phone cases and accesories, and sent me on my merry way asap. I should've just gone here to start. I would've had a working phone for hours instead of stress and frustration.

10/10 would highly recommend.< /Text>< pictures>

Firstly the 4 isn't for Lance, Lance was wonderful and gets a 5. The 4 is simply because the environment was a little hap hazard. It took two attempts at installing a screen protector to be successful because of how dusty the place is .That seems waistful. Also most of the display phones were dead.

Lance, guided me towards a product that I hadn't initially considered but was overall better for my lifestyle among other reasons. The phone is having a couple issues so I'm taking it in for the qr day warranty. I won't be changing phones just trading in my lemon.</Text>

I came into this store searching for the best deal possible and the gentleman who helped me out, Lance -- was very knowledgable about all the products and promos that I could take advantage of just for being a new customer. Through the tedious transaction, Lance was both patient and helpful, I highly recommend seeing him for the best deals :)

Thank you again Lance!<//Text>

<text>This location has improved immensely, its in the mall so not crazy slammed all the time. Zan the manager and Lee, the guy he was training turned activating my insurannce replacement phone into paying it off, crediting my account $30 for charges I missed , and got my bill reduced with a new LG phone and even got everything back , without my now lost old phone! Work with Zan and Lee, i am seriously impressed, i just got more money then i paid for my insurance phone, a brand new phone, an account credit,  AND my bill went down.

<Review>Walked in yesterday with my family in hopes to add my parents to my line.I was greeted immediately after walking in by not one or two of the workers but 3! Joseph A. (originally from a Fresno branch) was the person who approached me about what I needed help with.I said I needed to add 2 lines to my account and I was unsure of the process.He was so knowledgeable and affable the whole transaction was a breeze!He explained every step of the way.His other coworker-Hector? (I didn't quite catch his name-he was also from a different branch) also jumped in to help transfer information from my parents' old phone to their brand new Samsung S9+! The energy between all the workers was so positive and you can really tell they enjoy working with others and each other!Way to go with stepping up in making this Verizon location much better than it has been! My parents are ADDICTED to their phones and new accessories all because the help and smooth transitioning of you all! Thanks Joseph for being so cooperative with my dad and his questions,appreciate it!I will definitely send more people your way!</Review><GmapID>0x808e32a11070d717:0x7f6c9201dbb9aec< /GmapID><user_name>Lainaboo< /user_name>< pics>

< review>
Drove two hours  South of my home to return a phone to this specific Verizon store.  The staff was amazing.  Derek, an associate  at the store,  was extremely helpful and very professional.

Kim Cisek went above and beyond to help with a phone issue I had been dealing with unsuccessfully. Her level of knowledge and superior customer service was outstanding. She showed true concern for my issues from Start to finish. She was able to handle my issue while assisting other staff members simultaneously and all with a smile.

I have delt with many other Verizon stores in the 15+ years of being a customer and it can be frustrating at times,  but this was truely a pleasant experience. I would highly recommend this store and their staff.<//review>

TLDR: VZW phone support took 5hours to do what Travis was able to do in minutes. Come here for amazing customer service.

You guys. So I recently got a Pixel 3 XL and was having some troubles with completing the activation process. I've always done my own phone transfers and activations. And with the new Samsungs it was even easier so I'm not sure why I had issues. I called VZW customer support and I'm not sure where the miscommunication was but the kind lady on the phone told me I had to go in store to get a new sim card. I listened because we were both struggling at that point. 5 hours later we were still struggling so I decided to try a different Verizon store. The one closer to me was too full and low and slow on staffing so Eastridge Lp was my next best bet. You have no idea how it feels to see a familiar face, TRAVIS!!!!!. This good looking man used to work at your local Gen BBQ (multiple locations). You'll be happy to know those customer service skills have only gotten better over time. I was in and out of the store in less than minutes. It turns out the phone assist entered my sim incorrectly. He found the issue, fixed it, suggested phone cases and accesories, and sent me on my merry way asap. I should've just gone here to start. I would've had a working phone for hours instead of stress and frustration.

10/10 would highly recommend.</review>

Zan Tahir was one of the best Verizon personnel I've come into contact in years. He was upbeat from the start. Answered all my questions, and went above and beyond. He helped me get through a cellular transfer and was awesome all the way to the end. Definitely check out this store. I was extremely impressed.

<Review>My girlfriend and I decided to transition from our previous wireless provider to Verizon and also take advantage of Verizon's buy one get one free offer. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Grace Sammut. She was able to answer all of the questions I had and put my mind at ease. It was at this point that we decided that we could trust her for she had expert knowledge of Verizon's promotions, devices, and service plans and make the switch from T- Mobile. She helped us back up our data and transferred our photos and apps to our new Samsung Galaxy S9's. I was very pleased with her service and would highly recommend that new customers and existing customers speak with Grace if they want to upgrade or sign up with Verizon Wireless. Thank you for your patience and professionalism Grace Sammut!</Review></record>

Went into Verizon Eastridge today 7-19-18 and had the pleasure of working with Jose Almaraz. We did some things on our account and also wanted to buy new phones. First I wanted to lower my bill. Jose gave us some great options. We then were introduced to a Google Pixel 2, what a great phone. Jose went thru EVERYTHING about this phone
and showed us how to use it, he made it so simple, even for us older generation. He is a wonderful service rep and worked with us for a very long time. We so appreciate his patience. Please also know I have been a long  time customer and will continue to be because of Jose Almaraz. Thanks Jose!!!!!</review>

<UserId.>106238584300953602543< /UserId.><review>A couple days ago, I got the dreaded black screen on my 3-year old Galaxy S6 and took it in to the Eastridge Verizon.  I was greeted right away by LeeAnn.  She tried to reboot my phone but didn't have any luck.  She asked questions to zero in on what I was looking for in a phone and I selected one fairly quickly.  She was able to access my contacts and photos using my Yahoo and Gmail accounts and transferred them to the new phone.  Unfortunately, she wasn't able to transfer my texts because my phone was not functioning.  She and another associate explained that I could pay to have someone access and transfer the texts.  Well, the next day, my old phone was once again working.  So I took it in and LeeAnn transferred the texts as well.  Thank you, LeeAnn, for the great customer service!</review>< username>

Thank the heavens that this Verizon store had an employee and management makeover!! New staff (cellular sales) has definitely made this place a quality customer service heaven. My friend and I were having huge billing issues because of previous Verizon employees misled us, but the new staff helped sort everything out super fast and my plan to leave Verizon was cancelled. I would like to give a big shoutout and special thank you to Donavyn who was the main person who helped us sort everything out. He is a true customer service superstar, is extremely knowledgable and he went above and beyond to help us feel that we mattered and our case will be worked on. I almost went to legal counsel and was about to cut ties with Verizon, but thanks to Donavyn and his manager, everything worked out. Most phone stores I visit always show their "commission based sales" side, but Donavyn definitely put us as customers first. Thank you Donavyn!!< /text>

< Review>
Before coming here I connected to customer services reps online and their scipts by far turn out to be more of an inconvenience. Robert, though, went above and beyond. I surprised myself by having walked out with a pixel 3. I had a pixel 1.< /Review>

My name is Lan. I go to Verizon store to buy iphone. Han helped me very well. When I need to come to buy things or open more lines I will only meet Han.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Before showing me the phone I want. Han asked me carefully about how I used it to want it to do. Han is sure that I can buy the phone I need, not the phone I want. Thank you Han for taking the time for me because I'm not very good at telephones. She is indeed a precious gift from Verizon. Thank you Han again.

(Original)
Trước khi cho tôi thấy điện thoại tôi muốn. Hân hỏi tôi kĩ càng về việc tôi sử dụng ra sao muốn nó để làm gì. Hân chắc chắn rằng tôi mua được điện thoại tôi cần chứ không phải điện thoại tôi muốn. Cảm ơn Hân đã dành thời gian cho tôi vì tôi không giỏi điện thoại cho lắm. Cô ấy đúng là món quà quý báu của Verizon. Cảm ơn Hân một lần nữa.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

(Translated by Google) Kim and Han help me a lot, they answer every question I have. They help me change the phone with the promotion of LG and Asus tablet, promotion is very good. They help me set up new phones and tablets, transfer everything from my old machine. A great experience with them.

George was wonderful. He gave me an accurate estimate on a platinum resizing and engraving, that was very inexpensive in comparison to other estimates. They were quick and very kind. The ring was a wedding band, it was sized up separated (two separate rings) and it looks perfect. They did an amazing job! I am super, super happy with this work.</Review>

I’d recommend this store to anyone, and I do all the time!!! Between my boyfriend and I we have purchased 4 pieces of jewelry here, all beautiful and long lasting !!! If you purchase the warranty they will clean it for free whenever you ask them to, and it comes back looking brand new!! Any scratches/ tarnishes, cloudy diamonds, all gone !! I will continue to buy here forever and definitely keep an eye out for their sales because you can get amazing deals all the time. The staff is very helpful in helping you pick exactly what suits your needs, size and personality. Definitely go here!<//Text>

The associate in the store where so helpful, I was trying to buy a watch for my boyfriend for Christmas  while he was in the store so once he left I came back and bought the watch. All of the associates was looking out to make sure I could make the purchase very quickly without spoiling the surprise. Thank you guys so much. I will definitely return and tell everyone I know to shop at Kevin Jewelers !<//Review>

What an incredible experience. After ring shopping at a few places and being underwhelmed with huge price tags, I was more than pleasantly surprised with the warm welcoming by Alex, the beautiful rings and outstanding prices. Instead of not loving anything, I was picking between 6 rings I couldn't say no to. Alex was patient, funny and accommodating during the whole experience. It felt like I was there with a friend. I'm so excited to pick up my ring. I will absolutely return for any future jewelry needs.<//Text>

I walked in to buy my sister some cute diamond earrings for an early Christmas gift. I gave a budge to stay under, and Alec S. was able to help me out and stay in the budget such a friendly person it was like shopping with a friend. He had the patience and helped me decide what deal works better for my pocket, and for what I get. This is my first time shopping at the Parkway Plaza location, seems like a friendly environment. Definitely recommend for first time buyers like my self!<//text>

<review>I’m a repeated customer at Kevins jewelers, and what makes me keep coming back is the fact that they will not stop until they make me happy and get the price I’m looking for. Not to mention, they really take time to get to know me I consider Kevins jewelers a friend of mine I recommend you to give them a chance when you’re looking for jewelry and go to Keven’s jeweler. The sales people are amazing</review>< rating>

I would completely recommended this jewelry store to anyone I know. They are extremely professional and make the experience that much more memorable. I went in with my fiancé to choose her wedding band for our wedding coming up. She loved it so much! I can’t thank this store so much. You have made us both very happy. We will come back again!!</review>

Was shopping for an engagement ring. I had shopped  several other jewelers in the area and was not happy with the experience thus far. I encountered pushy and I’ll informed sales people. My last stop was Kevin’s, and was pleasantly surprised by their knowledge and excellent service. I will recommend them to others I know.< /review>

Unfortunately, less than 2 weeks later 2 stones fail out.  Luckily, I found both of them soon after and returned them to store immediately.  Without, question they took them and had the 2 fallen out stones and ring sent out to be restored.   In March of 2020 during Covid19 2 stones fell out again; back to back.  Unfortunately, I was unable to find either.   Having worn a ring on that finger for over 30 years I felt naked without wearing one.   Of, I was embarrassed thinking maybe someone may have knowest my 2 missing stones; Besides, Kevin Jewelers inside store malls had been closed.   After, Kevin Jewelers had reopened I immediately returned my ring and expressed all of the above.  By, this time my ring had been snagged a few times and bent a little around the edge due to missing stones of course.  The jeweler sales person immediately made insinuating accusations about the little dent at the corner of my ring as to why my stones had fallen out.   I, immediately mentioned to him that I had paid perhaps 3or4 Thousand for that ring and merely days after that 2 stones had fallen out and that they had repaired my ring.   He then checked his computer data and wittiness my truth.   He told me that he would send my ring out somewhere and that he would see what they say.  He mentioned that he will let me know in about 6weeks.   I told him to remind whom ever of my negative experience with that same ring only days after purchase.    STILL NAKEDLY WAITING.   I DID ASK FOR A REPLACEMENT UNTIL RETURN OF RING.   I was informed that they don’t accommodate.    WAITING!!!!< /review>< Pics>

Alec provided a phenomenal service from the moment we approached the location at Parkway Plaza in El Cajon. He has great knowledge and provides the best offers in San Diego. Alec accompanied by George and Mariam really made us feel welcomed and at home with great smiles, enthusiastic and fun personalities. I couldn't be more happier and thankful of finding just what i needed at a great price and service. Thank you for your great service once again, i highly recommend everyone to go and take a look at this great location.< /Text>

<review>Shopping for an engagement ring was stressful. I probably spent a good 45mins taking up George’s time. However, he was patient and I finally decided and made my choice (one of his suggestions). Thanks to him and the other associate who finally rang my undecided self up. Heading back there with the soon to be engaged half to pick out our wedding rings. See you then!</review><name>Chris Ellsworth< /name>< time>

< review>
Amazing customer service!!! My boyfriend and I recently had the pleasure to meet William form Kevin Jewelers in our El Cajon Location here in Ca. William helped ME pick out the perfect engagement ring for my boyfriend to purchase!! I was unsure of what I wanted and with little description of what I liked William was able to show me rings that were absolutely gorgeous!! Each one William presented me was more beautiful than the first!! I was done looking when William showed me a ring from their Enchanted Collection that was resting in the store window!! Thank you William!!! My boyfriend purchased the last ring I viewed and he used my number when purchasing the ring and I received a text last night thanking me for being a part of the Kevin Jewelers Family!!! Now I just have to wait for Christmas before I can wear that beauty!!! Thanks again William!!</review>

I truly recommend Kevin Jewelers because the people there are very friendly, patient, and helpful. Jordan and Sheila helped me get the best deal and the best engagement band for a great price to be honest and they did their best. I really appreciate you guys for being patient and helping me for the past couple of days to get what my girlfriend wanted!!!<//Text>

I went in to get my chain fixed, and ended up buy a beautiful ring for my husband & 2 necklaces. George helped me out and  I couldn't make up my mind and he was showing me everything. Not only do they have great stuff but the deal they gave me was GREAT!! My husband bought me a necklace I just bought jewelry & for sure we will be back. Thanks again Kevin Jewelers!
Thank you George!<//text>

<Review>I choose to go to Kevin Jewelers because they never make me feel pressured to purchase and they’re very accommodating with my budget. Today I found a wedding band slightly out of budget and Sheila was able to call the owner and knock down the price! She’s helped me both times I have shopped there. She’s always so patient and kind! This is the customer service I look for when I shop! Thank you Sheila for helping me find my perfect engagement ring setting and wedding band!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

This place was so amazing. Everyone is so nice and professional. I was all over the place with making my decision for a custom piece and they were so patient with me and delivered the most beautiful work. They treated my whole family so great. I will definitely be back. Maria was fantastic. She is so classy and professional. I appreciate everyone taking the time to show me feature of my own diamond and really make sure I felt comfortable with my choice for a vintage piece put in to a modern setting. Highly recommend.< /Review>

He was so nice and made us feel welcome and important from the moment we stepped in the jewelry store. He was on top of his customer service game. I never buy any warranties on anything. He sold me on the lifetime warranty for my ring due to his kindness and knowledge. Great experience. Will definitely be back when I am ready to buy my cuban link white gold necklace.

I took my friends in their because both were looking for rings for their S/O well, one associate said one price and then upped it 200 more because my friend was in the military his “ID was expired” was their excuse for price increase, don’t go here they will rip you off. We ended  up going to Kay and purchasing two rings for their S/O< /text>

From the moment my wife, baby boy and I walked into the store, he greeted us with sincerity and helped us with our purchase but it was the cradle-to-the-grave customer service that really touched my wife and myself because he showed integrity and resiliency in trying to make sure the price was within our budget.  Couldn't THANK YOU enough William,  you are definitely a J.D. POWER and Associates WINNER for Excellence in Customer Service in our book!!

I went there looking for a nice diamond ring for my wife for Christmas and something for myself. The expertises and customer service of Mariam and Alec was so great I came out a winner! Their in house credit helped me land a great deal on the ring that was actually better than I expected. Thank you and God bless you for making my Christmas a greater one. Happy wife happy life 😎</Review>

I had a fantastic experience coming here. The employees were extremely nice and very helpful in choosing the right ring. I had an amazing time, enjoyed everyone’s company really funny. I told them my price range and worked with me very well and also gave me all the information that I needed to know for my purchase. I highly recommend coming here if either your just looking or if you want to find the perfect ring and enjoy the company of the employees. They also offered a military discount which was tremendously considerate. I recommend coming here and I will come back next time I need to for another ring.</text>

I came into the Parkway Plaza location today with a few pieces in mind. Sheila helped me right away. She was extremely knowledgeable and friendly and sold me two pieces of jewelry and a warranty. As a first time fine jewelry customer, Sheila made this a very pleasant experience. I’ll definitely be back to this location!</review>

<text>I had visited the Kevin Jewelers in Valley Plaza mall in search of earrings when we were in that area. The lady who was helping us seemed very helpful and at the time seemed as if we were getting an amazing deal. The earrings we chose had a price tag for over $3k however the lady said we can take them for $1k. When we returned home from our trip the same day, I went on the webpage for Kevin jewelers in search of the earrings I purchased and seen they were priced at $700. We left robbed, but did not want to travel another 4hrs to get to the nearest Kevin Jewelers and return them. Never again will we shop there. I’m so glad we were able to find an AMAZING Jeweler in our area who we have been going for all our purchases.< /text>< Pictures>

{'time': 1564437651690, 'text': 'Hi Nalleli, we are sorry to hear about this confusion. To clarify, we do not carry the same pieces online as we do in-store so it is impossible that the item you saw in store was the same one online. If you’d like to email our customer service team at cs@kevinjewelers.com our customer service team would be happy to help you identify the piece you saw in store and explain how it is different from the one you may have seen online. While some styles may look similar, they will certainly not be the same. Also, to address your concern regarding our jewelry prices, since we are a jewelry manufacturer, we offer significant savings on jewelry. With branded jewelry, retailers face limitations imposed by the brand. However, with our manufactured jewelry, we do not face such limitations, and as a result, we provide large savings to our customers. We hope you will give us a another opportunity to serve you and prove this to you in person! Thank you.'}< /Resp>

I can't begin to describe how wonderful the service (and prices) are here. We had Alec help us pick out a ring for my fiance and he was wonderful. He provided excellent recommendations based on what we wanted in a ring and slowly worked towards a ring that my fiance liked. He even put it off to the side while we went and checked out other stores, but we ultimately came back and purchased one of the ones he showed us.
We had also been to Kevin Jewelers once before, for us both to get our fingers sized and they were awesome that time as well. They didn't really pressure us into anything and let us look around at our own pace.<//Text>

< Review>
I had an amazing experience.  Starting with Kelsey on the phone helping me navigate the mall to Bruce who showed me the Rolex bible.  I was able to see things there that most stores don't have.  Impressive!    So Bruce went to Maria and she saved the day.  She didn't try to steer my decision, she listen intently and matched my needs.  It was so cute when the three of us took a picture together.  It made me feel like my purchase was a big deal.  It certainly was for me.  Thank you for all that do and being genuinely happy for me.  All the best, Kathleen Wahl</Review>

<Text>Kevin Jewelers was absolutely amazing! Alec greated me instantly with a smile, and right off the bat he was friendly and willing to help me find that special gift for my wife. He was super patient with me as I took my time deciding between different pieces, and he even showed me others in my price range that were stunning. Bottom line is I'd HIGHLY recommend going to Kevin Jewelers for any and all of your jewelry needs. They have a great selection and even better prices. Best part is that they are willing to answer any and all questions you may have as well as use their expertise in helping you find the perfect item!

I have made several purchases at Kevin's Jewelers in Parkway Plaza in El Cajon Ca. I was given outstanding customer service and I am happy to say that I have been able to build an outstanding relationship with your staff.  When I go into the store they remember me, my purchases and my stories behind my items and what they all mean.  In other words I will continue to  buy all my future jewelry from this wonderful customer service oriented store. Thank you for your time.< /review>

<date>1565464071373</date><Review>I have finally found the best Jewelry store.  Kevin Jewelers is a family owned business.  I was greeted by George.  George was very helpful, friendly, not pushy at all, and 2nd very good looking man.  (Sorry George but my husband is #1). Lol. They have a beautiful selection of jewelry I could not decide which set of rings I wanted but ended up getting a very beautiful ring for my nieces birthday and what a great deal I got.  The girls were very nice as well.   I will be going back next week for our 30th Anniversary rings.  If you are looking for exceptional quality in jewelry I highly recommend Kevin Jewelers.< /Review>< rating>

Kelsey was engaging and pleasant at your El Cajon location, and with manager approval quickly got me a nice ring for my beloved.
Thank you!

Stopped by with my girlfriend to browse some of the jewelry on display. Alec was very quick to help and had wonderful suggestions. My girlfriend and I were eyeing one ring that he offered to let us try on. It happened to fit her finger perfectly and moments later we walked out both very happy with a rose sapphire and opal ring. Beautiful selection and amazing service!</review>

This place was amazing when it came to the customer service as well as the beautiful set up that's an eye catcher when passing. I mean I just had to go in and check it out. Alec who assisted me, was amazing and knowledgeable. He made me feel like we've known each other all our lives and the vibe throughout I couldn't get enough of. I will definitely be a reoccurring customer for my future purchases!! Thanks again Alec and Kelsey for making Valentines another special day in my world!! HAPPY HUMPDAY!!< /review>

<review>I have been in the Parkway Plaza store several times.  Everytime I am treated like a friend not just a random customer.  My primary concern is that I purchased a 4 carat diamond bracelet that has broken 2 times in the center of the bracelet. I purchased it in June/July and I am very concerned about it lasting a lifetime.  The joy I had from purchasing the bracelet I dreamed of is now a fear of it breaking again and not only loosing it but being told it is not covered by the lifetime insurance I purchased.  I have purchased many items from your store and recommended others as well. The ongoing issues with my bracelet has left me with deep feelings of regret and fear about my purchases at Kevin's.  The staff has been great but they explained that the store policy is out of  their control.  Great staff,questionable quality of a 4 carat diamond bracelet.< /review>< username>

We worked with Alec he was amazing very open gave us the fine detail and was the best. The jewelry they had was exactly what we were looking for but couldn't find any where else. If you need any Jewlery this is the best place. They are family owned and don't have the corporate set backs.<//Text>

My sales associate was Vivian, she was really awsome. I came in to their location after going to five other Jewelers in the mall and I told her exactly what I told every other previous sales rep, I'm just looking, thanks!.. she replied, that's fine, I'm here to help! She asked perfect questions, had really good customer service, was very knowledgeable. And their jewelry, earrings, necklaces etc were nice, plus they had a sale, they had really good deals. Overall it was great from start to finish. She didn't pressure me on what I was going to buy and I ended up leaving because I needed to think about it, I got something to eat in the food court, I went back and made a deal. My overall experience was great and I really do recommend Vivian at Kevin's Jewelers in the El Cajon Mall.</Review>

All I can say is Alec did an absolute wonderful job in resizing my watch, showing me the different types of Invicta and Movado watched. Clearly, he knew what he was talking about. I would strongly recommend anyone to go see him. Once I decide to get my gold chain, I'll definitely come back here since I trust his judgement.

Also, muna was very helpful in recommending necklaces to my sister. Simply put, both of these two have the best customer service out of any jewlers in Parkway Plaza. I didn't at any time feel like they were trying to swindle me for a bigger commission check. In other words, I appreciated the absolute honestly and integrety that these two individuals showed.</review>

<Review>I got a ring as a gift for my birthday and did not have the receipt. I went to get my ring sized the two associates were rude and disrespectful. The two associates were whispering amongs each other as if the ring was not purchased there. I felt belittled and I would NEVER come back to this jewelry store.< /Review>< userid>
