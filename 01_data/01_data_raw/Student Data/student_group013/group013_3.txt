Got work done here and I spent over 3000 for them to rebuild my transmission. Got my car back and it feels the same it still shakes and the transmission still slips. I took it back to them and they were going to charge me another 3000 to fix the rest. They are scammers I will never go back to this place and I warn you not to go there either. Especially for a transmission fix

I went there with a 2002 Acura TLS. The car had transmission problems and you told me that you will fix it. I was at your business. We had to finance cuz we didn't have enough money to pay on the spot. When you were "done" with my car I took it out of the parking lot and it was shaking already. I took the car back and told you guys that I was still having problema with the car and you guys were going to charge me again to "fix" it.  You guy didn't do anything to it in the beginning. Till this day the transmission slips and my car shakes. I have proof I was at your location I have the paperwork, we financed the "work" done to me car  it even has your address.<//review>

<Review>I brought my truck in, because my transmission was over heating at high speeds. I explained to him the gauge was near the yellow and he told me that I was looking at the radiator temp gauge.  I said the one that looks like a round gear with a thermometer inside it? He said yeah, that's not the transmission.  I knew at that moment I should leave. Maybe because I'm a female he assumed I had no idea what I was talking about. Guess what folks it was the transmission gauge.  After leaving it there all day he tells me nothing was wrong with the transmission and the over heating of the tyranny was because of some vents on my grill that close to warm up the engine in cold weather and those were malfunctioning.   Umm ok. So after driving over 5,000 miles on it, my transmission has suffered some damage due to him telling there's nothing wrong with my truck.</Review></record>

They don't open weekends. What am I suppose to give up work day lunch or sick day to have them tell me it's going to cost me $2000.00 to get it fixed. I found someone else to fix on the weekend. Thanks for nothing. Post that. Never calling.< /Review>

As long as you don't send your wife and have an inkling of basic auto repair these guys do phenomenal work.  I built a custom engine with fuel management, a one of a kind build CA legal.  I had to go back about 4 times for them to get it right but considering it was worth every penny.  Long story short, if you're stock they'll get you handled first time, if you're Jedi it's going to take some training but they will live up to their word and handle it.< /text>

<Review>I did a walk in for oil change/brake check and it was delivered very fast. This is a shocker because I usually wait all a day for a oil change at other places. I didn’t expect it to be completed so fast as I saw a couple people in the waiting room! Eric who helped explained my brakes issue was very clear and professional. My car is running much more smoothly after the oil and brake change here. Going to be a repeat customer for their quick car delivery and professionalism!!!! Totally recommend AAMCO!</Review>< Pics>

Came to this shop because it was the closest transmission shop near me and I was very well taken care of! The level of professionalism and the amount of effort they took to ease my troubles of my vehicle was great. Car ran perfect just like the first day I got it. Very fast and efficient. I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family and bring all my other vehicles here! Thank you Aamco</Review>

Highly recommended! Brought my 2010 Prius with ~100k miles due to sluggish performance. Was well greeted by their on-site manager Eric who took the time to listen to my concerns and provided a detailed diagnosis. After confirmed service, they worked quickly and I was able to overhear staff order parts needed for the repairs. Was offered local shuttle service when I left my car in the morning and received a call later that afternoon informing my car was ready for pick-up. I was very pleased with the results as my car is now running much better and noticeably stronger in areas of my local commute. Prices were reasonable and affordable and was a testament to the quality of work.< /review>

<text>Ok I’ve been a loyal customer of this branch for over 10 years. I’ve seen people come and go. I keep coming back, good or bad. I even bought them a coffee maker. You’ll see it in the lobby. They may mess up, but like with everyone (humans) you must give them a chance. They have always been fair and honest with me. And have fixed there mistakes. No one is perfect not even me. But give them a chance and bring your vehicle in. Mine is a Hummer, only shop working on it since 2007. M E Cooley Inspections 😊🌴

2019 Hey update, still with AAMCO. My engine blew up again, its all good. They still have my business, and its under new management. They fixed it, and I am back on the road. I am still a loyal customer. Thank you again and see you for my next oil change.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Ok it’s been a month since receiving my new engine and loads of other things (free things). Quin and Erik really did a good job. Diving my Hummer is a joy again. All we want is a auto shop that we can trust. Especially when your willing to pay, right? Where to take it? Take it to AAMCO of Covina California. I had to update my review. Thank you Quin and Erik and all the guys. 👍👍👍😊🌴< /Review></record></dataset><record>

They have great customer service and William was very helpful. He originally had given me an estimate of between 2500 and 2800 and told me the car would be done on Monday. The rebuilding of the transmission was faster than what was anticipated they had it done by Saturday and the total came out to less than 2200 which was awesome! Great place overall.</Review>

Apparently Jim has a problem with providing proper customer service. My sister had her Camry trans rebuilt there and it's failed 3 times since being worked on. Since I'm very knowledgable about cars, I stepped in to help with the situation. This guy has been shady since the start; he avoids answering direct questions and calling back. She has had to rent a car without reimbursement due to their faulty work, they claim to have rebuilt the trans inhouse, then stated they used rebuilt parts from other suppliers which failed. Still trying to get them to accept responsibility for their work and extend a warranty with little success. Definitely would not EVER recommend using this shop!</text>

Apparently this shop is dishonest (Jose) and love the bait and switch tactic. I called  and got a quote and less than 24hrs they almost double the price!. They might not have a good understanding of honering their price quote or know much about cars period. I advise and recommend no one to go to this AAMCO (on arrow/ Grand city of Covina)or any of it's other locations because obviously the company does  care about the customer.< /review>

1 Star is too much but I didn’t have the option to push 0 stars.
Gary manager is the most dishonest person I have ever dealt with. He had my SUV for 2 weeks, well actually 13 days. Before I had it towed there I had spoken with Gary on the phone. I couple hours after my vehicle got there Gary had to leave. Then another manager name Ben to over for a few days and I spoke with him and he made it sound like he was taking care of the authorization from my warranty company. Found out he wasn’t doing ANYTHING with SUV but sitting on his thumb. I had to call follow up on my suv because Gary wasn’t professional enough to call me. Too make this story short on the 11th day of his bs. I called and asked about my car then he said “ yes we just need to test ride it, let me call you back”. I felt he was lying and I went down there to find out he was lying and my car was not even close to being done....... I will stop here

<review>Worst place to take your car or truck I got my transmission rebuild by these guys they told me 5 days it took two weeks. I would call them every day and they would just tell me it would be done tomorrow and give me a call later but never gave me a call back. Once it was actually finished they left me with no oil in my motor and a exhaust leak. I do my oil changes I know exactly how much oil I had in it. Once it is rebuild they say bring it back in ten days it will only take twenty minutes to look at it. I bring it back and they turn me away saying all the lifts are full come back another day. I already gave these guys two grand by the way. I try to take it back a second time and I call ahead to they can have a lift cleared but they still tell me no. I had to give them a hard time to look at what they said they would. Finally they look at it and say the exhaust leak. isn't from them so I paid someone else $200 tip fix it because I will not trust these guys out go back their ever again< /review>< Pics>

I took my truck on 9-12-14 to get an estimate to rebuild my transmission and Jordan Post told me that it would be between $1000.00 to  $2000.00 and he would call me with the exact amount in 3 days. When  i didn't hear from him I had to call him twice he said his mechanic was stuck in traffic, so he said he would call me the next morning and he did and gave me a quote of $2700.00 and i told him that he said in the beginning it would be no more than $2000.00 other wise i would not have left my truck there. So i told him don't do nothing i'm picking up my truck so when i got there he told me he couldn't give me my truck cause all the parts were not there and it would be $450.00 and come back tomorrow,so i called the police and he told the police the trans was in Hemet, so the police said there is nothing they can do but that they have been there 2or 3 times before for the same thing. So i went the next day to pick up my truck and he said the only way you can pick up your truck is if you  pay cash and i said no i'm paying with a credit card so then i had to call the police again and then he said don't call them just give me your credit card and by the way i took my truck to Luis Automotive 2 doors down they rebuilt it in 2 days and it runs like new and he charged me $1500.00.</review>

From day 1, the manager, Jim, told us they are 30% cheaper than the dealership price with a free evaluation. We were very pleased with the things he had to say on the phone, so we decided to go ahead and have them work on my car. After they diagnosed it, found out it was an $800 charge, whereas Ford's price was $125. The price we got from Ford was about $4,000 for a new transmission including labor and all. Jim told us it would be between $1500-$2500. Later in the week, he changed his answer to $3800 for the final price. I couldn't take it to Ford where I would've rather taken it back to because I was apparently down $800 regardless, so we stayed with not much of a choice.

2) Rental/charge
The first thing he told us was the rentals were free. Another time, told us only the $25 rental was free (a Fiat). We had the "upgraded" car that was $40 so he said he'd take off $25 off each day. Great! When I was picking up my car, I found out he had tacked on all the charges on top of the original price he gave us. The whole cost of this entire thing was about $4500. The "discounted" price should have been off the $3800 total that he gave us. He failed to provide us with those details. Not only was that inching toward one grand more than his original price, his quote of "30% cheaper than the dealership price" was invalid.

3) Timeframe/duration
Day one, he told us it would be 3-5 days until I have my car back. We had it towed over there on Tuesday and told us they would call us Friday and again, changed his answer to 5-7 days. That following Monday, he calls and tells us that they barely took it apart and gave us the cost. He then told us it should be ready Wednesday. Wednesday comes and they test drove it and it jolted when changing gears so they had to work on it and would be ready Thursday. Thursday comes, nothing. Finally got my car back today (Saturday) with no communication in between.

Overall, we will not be doing business with them again. We don't work with shady liars and will be contacting the headquarters about all of this. The lack of communication is very unprofessional. The fact that he tacked on money we weren't aware of is very unprofessional. We were taken advantage of and it ruined the entire company for us. I hope you're proud, Jim.<//Text>

Apparently this shop is dishonest (Jose) and love the bait and switch tactic. I called  and got a quote and less than 24hrs they almost double the price!. They might not have a good understanding of honering their price quote or know much about cars period. I advise and recommend no one to go to this AAMCO (on arrow/ Grand city of Covina)or any of it's other locations because obviously the company does  care about the customer.<//Text>

1 Star is too much but I didn’t have the option to push 0 stars.
Gary manager is the most dishonest person I have ever dealt with. He had my SUV for 2 weeks, well actually 13 days. Before I had it towed there I had spoken with Gary on the phone. I couple hours after my vehicle got there Gary had to leave. Then another manager name Ben to over for a few days and I spoke with him and he made it sound like he was taking care of the authorization from my warranty company. Found out he wasn’t doing ANYTHING with SUV but sitting on his thumb. I had to call follow up on my suv because Gary wasn’t professional enough to call me. Too make this story short on the 11th day of his bs. I called and asked about my car then he said “ yes we just need to test ride it, let me call you back”. I felt he was lying and I went down there to find out he was lying and my car was not even close to being done....... I will stop here
DONT GO HERE!!<//Text>< pictures>

Apparently Jim has a problem with providing proper customer service. My sister had her Camry trans rebuilt there and it's failed 3 times since being worked on. Since I'm very knowledgable about cars, I stepped in to help with the situation. This guy has been shady since the start; he avoids answering direct questions and calling back. She has had to rent a car without reimbursement due to their faulty work, they claim to have rebuilt the trans inhouse, then stated they used rebuilt parts from other suppliers which failed. Still trying to get them to accept responsibility for their work and extend a warranty with little success. Definitely would not EVER recommend using this shop!<//Text>

I took my truck on 9-12-14 to get an estimate to rebuild my transmission and Jordan Post told me that it would be between $1000.00 to  $2000.00 and he would call me with the exact amount in 3 days. When  i didn't hear from him I had to call him twice he said his mechanic was stuck in traffic, so he said he would call me the next morning and he did and gave me a quote of $2700.00 and i told him that he said in the beginning it would be no more than $2000.00 other wise i would not have left my truck there. So i told him don't do nothing i'm picking up my truck so when i got there he told me he couldn't give me my truck cause all the parts were not there and it would be $450.00 and come back tomorrow,so i called the police and he told the police the trans was in Hemet, so the police said there is nothing they can do but that they have been there 2or 3 times before for the same thing. So i went the next day to pick up my truck and he said the only way you can pick up your truck is if you  pay cash and i said no i'm paying with a credit card so then i had to call the police again and then he said don't call them just give me your credit card and by the way i took my truck to Luis Automotive 2 doors down they rebuilt it in 2 days and it runs like new and he charged me $1500.00.</Review>

Got work done here and I spent over 3000 for them to rebuild my transmission. Got my car back and it feels the same it still shakes and the transmission still slips. I took it back to them and they were going to charge me another 3000 to fix the rest. They are scammers I will never go back to this place and I warn you not to go there either. Especially for a transmission fix

I went there with a 2002 Acura TLS. The car had transmission problems and you told me that you will fix it. I was at your business. We had to finance cuz we didn't have enough money to pay on the spot. When you were "done" with my car I took it out of the parking lot and it was shaking already. I took the car back and told you guys that I was still having problema with the car and you guys were going to charge me again to "fix" it.  You guy didn't do anything to it in the beginning. Till this day the transmission slips and my car shakes. I have proof I was at your location I have the paperwork, we financed the "work" done to me car  it even has your address.<//text>

I brought my truck in, because my transmission was over heating at high speeds. I explained to him the gauge was near the yellow and he told me that I was looking at the radiator temp gauge.  I said the one that looks like a round gear with a thermometer inside it? He said yeah, that's not the transmission.  I knew at that moment I should leave. Maybe because I'm a female he assumed I had no idea what I was talking about. Guess what folks it was the transmission gauge.  After leaving it there all day he tells me nothing was wrong with the transmission and the over heating of the tyranny was because of some vents on my grill that close to warm up the engine in cold weather and those were malfunctioning.   Umm ok. So after driving over 5,000 miles on it, my transmission has suffered some damage due to him telling there's nothing wrong with my truck.</text>

I did a walk in for oil change/brake check and it was delivered very fast. This is a shocker because I usually wait all a day for a oil change at other places. I didn’t expect it to be completed so fast as I saw a couple people in the waiting room! Eric who helped explained my brakes issue was very clear and professional. My car is running much more smoothly after the oil and brake change here. Going to be a repeat customer for their quick car delivery and professionalism!!!! Totally recommend AAMCO!<//Text>

Highly recommended! Brought my 2010 Prius with ~100k miles due to sluggish performance. Was well greeted by their on-site manager Eric who took the time to listen to my concerns and provided a detailed diagnosis. After confirmed service, they worked quickly and I was able to overhear staff order parts needed for the repairs. Was offered local shuttle service when I left my car in the morning and received a call later that afternoon informing my car was ready for pick-up. I was very pleased with the results as my car is now running much better and noticeably stronger in areas of my local commute. Prices were reasonable and affordable and was a testament to the quality of work.</Text>

Ok it’s been a month since receiving my new engine and loads of other things (free things). Quin and Erik really did a good job. Diving my Hummer is a joy again. All we want is a auto shop that we can trust. Especially when your willing to pay, right? Where to take it? Take it to AAMCO of Covina California. I had to update my review. Thank you Quin and Erik and all the guys. 👍👍👍😊🌴<//Review>

Apparently Jim has a problem with providing proper customer service. My sister had her Camry trans rebuilt there and it's failed 3 times since being worked on. Since I'm very knowledgable about cars, I stepped in to help with the situation. This guy has been shady since the start; he avoids answering direct questions and calling back. She has had to rent a car without reimbursement due to their faulty work, they claim to have rebuilt the trans inhouse, then stated they used rebuilt parts from other suppliers which failed. Still trying to get them to accept responsibility for their work and extend a warranty with little success. Definitely would not EVER recommend using this shop!<//review>

Apparently this shop is dishonest (Jose) and love the bait and switch tactic. I called  and got a quote and less than 24hrs they almost double the price!. They might not have a good understanding of honering their price quote or know much about cars period. I advise and recommend no one to go to this AAMCO (on arrow/ Grand city of Covina)or any of it's other locations because obviously the company does  care about the customer.<//text>

DO NOT GO HERE!! DO NOT GO HERE! DO NOT GO HERE!!
1 Star is too much but I didn’t have the option to push 0 stars.
Gary manager is the most dishonest person I have ever dealt with. He had my SUV for 2 weeks, well actually 13 days. Before I had it towed there I had spoken with Gary on the phone. I couple hours after my vehicle got there Gary had to leave. Then another manager name Ben to over for a few days and I spoke with him and he made it sound like he was taking care of the authorization from my warranty company. Found out he wasn’t doing ANYTHING with SUV but sitting on his thumb. I had to call follow up on my suv because Gary wasn’t professional enough to call me. Too make this story short on the 11th day of his bs. I called and asked about my car then he said “ yes we just need to test ride it, let me call you back”. I felt he was lying and I went down there to find out he was lying and my car was not even close to being done....... I will stop here
DONT GO HERE!!</text>

<Text>Worst place to take your car or truck I got my transmission rebuild by these guys they told me 5 days it took two weeks. I would call them every day and they would just tell me it would be done tomorrow and give me a call later but never gave me a call back. Once it was actually finished they left me with no oil in my motor and a exhaust leak. I do my oil changes I know exactly how much oil I had in it. Once it is rebuild they say bring it back in ten days it will only take twenty minutes to look at it. I bring it back and they turn me away saying all the lifts are full come back another day. I already gave these guys two grand by the way. I try to take it back a second time and I call ahead to they can have a lift cleared but they still tell me no. I had to give them a hard time to look at what they said they would. Finally they look at it and say the exhaust leak. isn't from them so I paid someone else $200 tip fix it because I will not trust these guys out go back their ever again</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I took my truck on 9-12-14 to get an estimate to rebuild my transmission and Jordan Post told me that it would be between $1000.00 to  $2000.00 and he would call me with the exact amount in 3 days. When  i didn't hear from him I had to call him twice he said his mechanic was stuck in traffic, so he said he would call me the next morning and he did and gave me a quote of $2700.00 and i told him that he said in the beginning it would be no more than $2000.00 other wise i would not have left my truck there. So i told him don't do nothing i'm picking up my truck so when i got there he told me he couldn't give me my truck cause all the parts were not there and it would be $450.00 and come back tomorrow,so i called the police and he told the police the trans was in Hemet, so the police said there is nothing they can do but that they have been there 2or 3 times before for the same thing. So i went the next day to pick up my truck and he said the only way you can pick up your truck is if you  pay cash and i said no i'm paying with a credit card so then i had to call the police again and then he said don't call them just give me your credit card and by the way i took my truck to Luis Automotive 2 doors down they rebuilt it in 2 days and it runs like new and he charged me $1500.00.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I'm not one to go out of my way to write up complaints unless needed, but this calls for it.

1) Cost
From day 1, the manager, Jim, told us they are 30% cheaper than the dealership price with a free evaluation. We were very pleased with the things he had to say on the phone, so we decided to go ahead and have them work on my car. After they diagnosed it, found out it was an $800 charge, whereas Ford's price was $125. The price we got from Ford was about $4,000 for a new transmission including labor and all. Jim told us it would be between $1500-$2500. Later in the week, he changed his answer to $3800 for the final price. I couldn't take it to Ford where I would've rather taken it back to because I was apparently down $800 regardless, so we stayed with not much of a choice.

2) Rental/charge
The first thing he told us was the rentals were free. Another time, told us only the $25 rental was free (a Fiat). We had the "upgraded" car that was $40 so he said he'd take off $25 off each day. Great! When I was picking up my car, I found out he had tacked on all the charges on top of the original price he gave us. The whole cost of this entire thing was about $4500. The "discounted" price should have been off the $3800 total that he gave us. He failed to provide us with those details. Not only was that inching toward one grand more than his original price, his quote of "30% cheaper than the dealership price" was invalid.

3) Timeframe/duration
Day one, he told us it would be 3-5 days until I have my car back. We had it towed over there on Tuesday and told us they would call us Friday and again, changed his answer to 5-7 days. That following Monday, he calls and tells us that they barely took it apart and gave us the cost. He then told us it should be ready Wednesday. Wednesday comes and they test drove it and it jolted when changing gears so they had to work on it and would be ready Thursday. Thursday comes, nothing. Finally got my car back today (Saturday) with no communication in between.

Overall, we will not be doing business with them again. We don't work with shady liars and will be contacting the headquarters about all of this. The lack of communication is very unprofessional. The fact that he tacked on money we weren't aware of is very unprofessional. We were taken advantage of and it ruined the entire company for us. I hope you're proud, Jim.< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_name>

Apparently this shop is dishonest (Jose) and love the bait and switch tactic. I called  and got a quote and less than 24hrs they almost double the price!. They might not have a good understanding of honering their price quote or know much about cars period. I advise and recommend no one to go to this AAMCO (on arrow/ Grand city of Covina)or any of it's other locations because obviously the company does  care about the customer.<//review>

1 Star is too much but I didn’t have the option to push 0 stars.
Gary manager is the most dishonest person I have ever dealt with. He had my SUV for 2 weeks, well actually 13 days. Before I had it towed there I had spoken with Gary on the phone. I couple hours after my vehicle got there Gary had to leave. Then another manager name Ben to over for a few days and I spoke with him and he made it sound like he was taking care of the authorization from my warranty company. Found out he wasn’t doing ANYTHING with SUV but sitting on his thumb. I had to call follow up on my suv because Gary wasn’t professional enough to call me. Too make this story short on the 11th day of his bs. I called and asked about my car then he said “ yes we just need to test ride it, let me call you back”. I felt he was lying and I went down there to find out he was lying and my car was not even close to being done....... I will stop here

My sister had her Camry trans rebuilt there and it's failed 3 times since being worked on. Since I'm very knowledgable about cars, I stepped in to help with the situation. This guy has been shady since the start; he avoids answering direct questions and calling back. She has had to rent a car without reimbursement due to their faulty work, they claim to have rebuilt the trans inhouse, then stated they used rebuilt parts from other suppliers which failed. Still trying to get them to accept responsibility for their work and extend a warranty with little success. Definitely would not EVER recommend using this shop!< /text></record></dataset><record>

I took my truck on 9-12-14 to get an estimate to rebuild my transmission and Jordan Post told me that it would be between $1000.00 to  $2000.00 and he would call me with the exact amount in 3 days. When  i didn't hear from him I had to call him twice he said his mechanic was stuck in traffic, so he said he would call me the next morning and he did and gave me a quote of $2700.00 and i told him that he said in the beginning it would be no more than $2000.00 other wise i would not have left my truck there. So i told him don't do nothing i'm picking up my truck so when i got there he told me he couldn't give me my truck cause all the parts were not there and it would be $450.00 and come back tomorrow,so i called the police and he told the police the trans was in Hemet, so the police said there is nothing they can do but that they have been there 2or 3 times before for the same thing. So i went the next day to pick up my truck and he said the only way you can pick up your truck is if you  pay cash and i said no i'm paying with a credit card so then i had to call the police again and then he said don't call them just give me your credit card and by the way i took my truck to Luis Automotive 2 doors down they rebuilt it in 2 days and it runs like new and he charged me $1500.00.< /Text>

Everytime I go in everyone is usually very helpful and kind. Today I purchased a roll on perfume, I instantly took it back, because it was missing 1/3 of the product. On top of me sending my recipe to my email, and the employ recognizing my name and email was misspelled for the phone number I gave. They worked it out fast with no problems, and I left with a new perfume as paid for. Service much appreciated.< /review>

After knowing 4 people who died from Covid, I was reluctant to take my daughter for a haircut. I watched the video of the precautions on the Ulta website and booked an online appointment.  We arrived a few minutes early. They had a hard time finding our online reservation. No big deal. I was told the hairdresser was still working on customer. I looked around and waited. First off, no one was wearing gloves (even though the website stated they would be). Secondly one of the hairdressers barely had a mask on. Nose fully exposed breathing down on the client.  Come on people. It’s really not that hard.  So after waiting for nearly 20 minutes without even seeing (or being greeted by) our hairdresser.  We ultimately canceled and left, due to time constraints and safety concerns.  I can’t speak of the quality, but everything was pretty poor.  I’ll reluctantly give 2 stars, assuming the haircut would be good. Which it should be, for the price. I won’t be back.</Text>

<Text>When I went to pick up my order, the employee there didn’t even look up at me when she talked to me, she was on her phone. I think her name was Adrianna, she had black long hair. However, another employee with purple hair was very nice and helpful, I appreciate her recommendations so much! If you need help, ask her :)</Text><gmap_id>0x80dc992bce0ce5fb:0xb38d968cec8db521< /gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

The employees are great, super attentive, nice gals... it’s the security guy I have an issue with. You can’t shop comfortably without him following you around and watching what your looking at like you’re about to steal it for well paying customers. Seriously reconsider this approach or this staff member, he’s driving away sales. I chose to go to a competitor for my make up needs after that experience, Macy’s and Sephora are now my go to options Bc of that experience.< /text>

@jenna.lee.beauty worked on my hair and makeup on the day of my cousins big wedding and she was amazing! Not only is her personality sweet and thoughtful, but also her work of art. There was no need to ask her to re-do or make some changes to my face and hair, since hair and face were perfectly glowing! I would highly recommend working with her on any big day!! Also I really appreciated that she was able to accommodate me last minute! Thank you so much Jenna!< /Review>

<Text>Katarina has done highlights in my hair more than once and I am always so happy with the turn out. I’ve tried many different hair stylist but I still would have such horrible yellow tones, but every time she does my hair it has the platinum/silver look that I’m aiming for. Definitely 5+ stars all around!<//Text>< rating>

Nice place. Clean. I was just picking up a order my girlfriend had ordered and was helped. The Woman was very polite and fast. Only thing that ruined it was a older woman who Decided to put her 2 cents into a conversation i was having with the woman who worked there. Can’t do anything about rude people tho 🤷🏽‍♂️< /text>

I went in looking for a concealer and new foundation. The woman who was trying to match my concealer could not match the right color. After that, there was a tall guy who helped me match the foundation. He was extremely friendly, patient, helpful and made the trip worth it regardless of the concealer fail. Wish I got his name but he was great! Thank you :)<//text>

<Text>Had a wonderful experience at this Ulta. I went to the Dermalogica Skin Bar and was attended to by Jamie. She gave me a 10 minute facial and it was very relaxing 😌. She has very gentle hands so I recommend you go to her if you ever want to make an appointment for facial or other skin care. There were plenty of helpful staff and my check out was smooth. I’ll definitely be going back.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This was the second time I have ever gone to the Ulta in the Lake Elsinore location. Those two times I was approached by I believe Stephanie is her name she’s the manager or something but the minute I walk in my friend and I are being stared at. She sends the security to us we were in the back looking for purple shampoo once the security leaves she comes to us to just look at us then leaves 5 mins later the security comes acts like he’s going into the door then leaves right when he leaves that’s when Stephanie approaches us once again asks us “can I help you guys?” I said “yes, why are you watching us and sending the security to look at what we’re doing? You’re making us feel like we’re stealing or something” she said “well I wasn’t aware i was making you feel that way. But do you guys need help ?” I just left what I was gonna buy and left. The second time I asked her where the James Charles pallet was she looked at me laughed and said “right there” and rolled her eyes. She’s probably the most rudest in that store. Never going back again.</Text>

<Review>Came for the first time and very clean and nice because it's new. But my bf and I had just walked in and started looking at the perfume and right away the security guard started circles around where we were, I didn't think much of it until we move to look at the shampoos and conditioner and he still was only circling where we were at and not once was doing that where all the other people were. Felt super judge and stereotyped so we will not be going back to this location. My bf is tatted and dressed still in work clothes and I had all black on so idk if that's why but didn't feel right how the guard was only near us the whole time we were there.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I honestly had terrible customer service ever coming to this Ulta location! I always go shopping at Ulta but in other locations. I wanted to try this one out but they did not make me feel comfortable shopping in there. By that I mean this one girl acted like I was going to steal something. I do get that all places do that so at first I did not mind but she literally followed me everywhere in the store and right next to me too. She was maybe a few feet away staring at me. I felt like I couldn't enjoying shopping when there is someone not leaving my side for one sec. I asked her a question in regards to a credit card and she was giving me an attitude telling me about it. So I was like okay thank you and walked away. Right after that she was still watching me while a coworker went up to her and asked her what I had asked. I'm not going to write their whole convo about me but they were both laughing at me about the credit card like if I'm stupid. So finally I was going to pay but I was so upset that I gave everything to the lady up front and walked out. The only person actually being nice was a woman that worked up front. The other two should be treating people how they would like to be treated with respect. I didn't get their names but they were two older ladies. If you want to shop at ulta I recommend driving all the way to the mall.</Review>

Customer service was great until it came down to the price. Lots of items in the curler/ironer section were in wrong places and prices differed at check out. Employees didn't help the situation. Ended up leaving to another store.<//review>

most of the staff are sweet and helpful but most are just whatever about their job and extremely rude.

Had my bf return something for me as I had a duplicate of the product at home and someone told him that I should fly a kite. WOW. He was shocked as well. I didn’t even know the cashier personally and neither did he. I rarely go to this ulta too but seeing as how rude and unnecessary that comment was I will go to the ulta in Corona.<//Review>

< review>
once again I had issues with one of the lake elisnore managers "stephanie "  this isnt the first time. My first run in she rudely asked me what I was  going to do with a colored eyeliner..A few other times she has been rude, and while this time it wasn't blatantly rude it was aggressive and somewhat harassing. My friend and I came in looking around , she greeted us asked us if we wanted a basket..  we each declined, and thanked her anyways. However,  it would of been fine if it had ended there, but she continued to ask us if we wanted a basket at least 5 times more in the 20 mins or so that we were in there. I spend plenty of money at ulta,  I also work retail as a manager for a department in a grocery store. I know when I am being followed,  harassed and pretty much acused of stealing or that I was going to try to. She was not comfortable with me just holding my two small items. At least two of the times I had no items yet in my hands. It's bad enough when loss prevention follows and watches,  but that is their job.  It is not hers to follow and harass me asking me the same annoying question over and over.  I keep wanting to give the lake elisnore location another chance as I have had pleasant experiences with other managers there and associates,  but stephanie needs to have some serious training.  I am a platinum member at ulta and a VIB at sephora. I have never experienced this kinda harassment at sephora. I know sometimes you get what you pay for, but I spend enough at ulta yearly to not be harassed repeatedly by the same person who is supposed to be a manager,  the face of your company.</review>

If you don’t look like a Stacy or Becky you will be followed by the super obvious security guard. My boyfriend and I were just browsing the store, and I was wearing a baggy flannel shirt and generally kind of tomboy-ish looking so OF COURSE I’m there to steal your makeup. Get real, dude. Try to be less obvious when you’re robotically walking by the aisle and looking over at us multiple times.< /review>

<response>None<//response><text>Stephanie has been consistently rude and disrespectful every single time I’ve been here, ever since the very first time being “helped” by her. She makes faces and gives you looks for no reason, and has an attitude over honoring THEIR COUPONS.

She has been the only associate so far to tell me that even exchanges are not possible when a coupon and points have been used together.... what? Every other location has absolutely no problem doing this, what gives? So I ask her to elaborate and her explanation was BS, I tell her I’m still not understanding her explanation and she has the audacity to say, “Well you should, it’s pretty simple.” BOLD girl! The security guard had been standing there at the register just STARING me down for no reason while she was dishing me attitude, like can you not? Then he has the nerve to chime in after that smart remark by Stephanie!!!! Unbelievable.

The other day I went to use the $3.50 coupon with a nail polish purchase, and Stephanie immediately isn’t willing to apply it or try, since apparently “nail polish is prestige”. Ok fine. I purchase them anyways, go home to check if the ulta app would have allowed me to use the coupon, and IT WORKS. NAIL POLISH IS NOT PRESTIGE, at least OPI isn’t. I confirmed within the fine print details link on the app that OPI is NOT on the list of restricted items for the regular $3.50 coupon, so she was full of it!

She just didn’t feel like honoring the coupon for me, and I don’t come to ulta to be discriminated against. Thank you very much for that.

Not only her, but the rest of the employees have horrible attitudes! Everyone is nasty and rude. Their security guards are the absolute worst, stalking you around the store and just STARING at you up and down to the point where I actually had to ask the old security guy if he needed something from me because he would not break eye contact. That kind of behavior is just excessive. Especially considering I’m a DIAMOND customer. Better RUSH through your shopping trip here, otherwise you’ll be stalked around the store as if you’re a criminal. Trying to decide on nail polish colors and the security guard circled me a MINIMUM of 20 times.

A comfortable shopping experience is absolutely not what they accomplish here. Can’t even walk around the store without feeling like you’re doing something wrong.

Makes me not want to shop with ulta anymore if this is their idea of customer service standards!!!! Horrible.</text><user_name>D R< /user_name><date>1562063734811< /date></record>

My daughter and I thought the birria was delicious! Very authentic.

I must have literally driven past this restaurant without noticing it hundreds of times over the years. It is very easy to miss; small, no flashy sign, and just blends into the little strip of business where it is located. It is not a fancy, but we were treated very well by the family who owns and operates this business. The service and food were both great, and I will definitely be going back again!< /review>

I was the only one who wasn't speaking Spanish while I was there.

As their name implies, birria is their specialty with Birria de Res (beef) and Birria de Chivo (goat) available in both seca (dry) and caldo (soup) forms. Menudo and pozole also are listed under Specialties  and other Mexican standards are on the menu like burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and tortas.

The Caldo version comes with corn tortillas, lemon and lime wedges, and topped with onions, cilantro and salsa. The broth is flavorful and mildly spicy. The goat meat was tender and not too gamey.

I liked it, but thought it was a little pricey at just under $13.

Friendly service.<//review></record>

<rating>5<//rating><review>The Birria tacos are simply delicious. The goat was was tender and juicy. The broth was absolutely heavenly. It was a bit pricey at just under $4 a taco, but i was hooked after the first bite in 48 hours I've ordered tacos 4 times. Even the kids love the goat meat. I am completely addicted to these tacos.< /review><username>Ang T<//username><resp>None< /resp>< Pics>

I love my tacos. For me is always my tortilla and steak, nothing more, no onions, cilantro or anything else,  why? Because when you gave me such a juicy flavorful steak perfectly seasoned,  you don't need to add anything for a better flavor 😀. I love this place and i highly recommend it.  I feel at home when I'm here,  everybody is nice, polite and happy to help.</Text>

I never leave bad reviews but this was one of the worst birria that I've ever tasted the broth ( consome ) was super salty the rice tasted like old oily rice and beans tasted straight out of a can. Never again! Took forever to bring out! Not worth a penny!< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Sunday, May 22, I got to eat birria, the slow service, the orders of birria with little flavor, the refried beans and rice came swimming in water, ask the waitresses for something to bring what we did not want to eat there, they never gave it to us at the table, I had to go with the cashier to ask him,
It is assumed that it is unhygienic for cashiers to wait for the fact of using coins and bills, never put on gloves,
Hopefully the owner will pay attention to my comment and not delete it.
Thanks and good day

(Original)
Domingo 22 de Mayo, llegue a comer birria, el servicio lento, las ordenes de birria con poco sabor, los frijoles y arroz refritos venian nadando en agua, solicite a las meseras algo para llevar lo que no quisimos comer ahi, nunca nos lo dieron en la mesa, tuve que ir con la cajera para pedirle,
Se supone que es antihigienico que las cajeras sean meseras por el hecho de utilizar monedas y billetes, nunca se puso guantes,
Ojala que el dueño ponga atencion a mi comentario y no lo borre.

<username>Bradley Paoli< /username><review>The food is hit or miss. At times it's about as good as a home cooked meal and at others it's simply low quality cafeteria food. Their desert selection is always good however. With that said it's nearly always overly crowded and they usually don't have enough seating compared to the other campus dining halls. I wouldn't say that their selection is much better than the others either.</review><gmapID>0x808e410a5df1fe0d:0x5f5ceef5d651e6ca<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Their food is like.... Pretty lame for the price you pay. Don't come between 11-12, 4-5, 8-9 unless you only want to eat Pizza.

The staff here I'll listen to you though. If you have a question, complaint or concern, they will take it into consideration and sometimes change things, which is awesome! I really have to give them props for that.

Their breakfast is usually okay. Food on the weekends I'd much better than weekday foods.

There's always a salad bar and a sandwich station, so you can always have that.< /text>

Not bad but I can’t say it is delicious. This dining hall is good at Asian foods. Chinese, Indian and Vietnamese food are available sometimes. Its quality can no way be compared with restaurants but I think it is quite good among college dining halls.</Text>

Arguably the best dining hall on campus. Doesn't necessarily mean the food is spectacular, but you get your money's worth and if you have to choose a dining hall on campus, this is usually the best bet. Good array of food. You can count on there always being pizza, cereal, soup, and a salad bar. Also always an option of fruit and pastry. The rest of the menu switches out. Seating can be hard to find but is usually okay, especially when they open up the MPR for additional seating. Is open the longest and most often out of all the dining halls on campus.< /text>

Definitely the best dining hall on campus. Always super crowded but it's a college cafeteria, so it's expected. Food quality can also vary sometimes.</Review>

<Text>Sullen young people serving edible but bland food. All you can eat buffet for low-income students. The fruits, the salad bar, and the soup are probably saving lives as I have seen students going hungry in Santa Cruz. There're different stations for different kind of cuisine, beverages, desserts etc. Pizzas--usually three different kinds-- seem to be favorite with students as are array of deep fried foods. There are piles of fresh bread I have seen people making their own sandwiches and walking off with supplies for the week.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808e410a5df1fe0d:0x5f5ceef5d651e6ca< /Gmap_id>< date>

It's about 10 dollars to stay as long as you want. The prices change for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, you could get in for breakfast and stay till dinner, and just wait till they swap out the food.

The quality of the food is not the best. It is mass produced and has thus lost all personal connection. It is a buffet style dining hall, with many options.<//text>

College nine dining hall is the superior dining experience because of their food selection and addition of an extra station. Sometimes operating with 6 stations just the extra chance they will have something beyond edible increases</text>

It is the dining  hall that stays open the longest on campus.  It doesn't  offer the same atmosphere as Cowell  but is is nice nevertheless.< /text>

Good. Average dining hall food, good selection friendly service. As long as you can clean your table and don't mind noise, this is not a bad choice for food.< /Review>

I have been going to see Dr. Miranda for at least 15 years and cannot say enough good things about him, his staff and his smoothly run and very professionally operation.

Dr. Miranda is a detailed perfectionist who stays on top of the latest developments. This, coupled with his years of experience, personable nature and great communication skills makes him a top notch dentist.

I am a nervous person and have special need for extra care regarding getting and staying numb.  Dr. Miranda patiently does whatever it takes to make sure I am never in pain. He is the most gentle dentist and somehow still does great work.

I highly recommend him and his team.< /Text>

Both Dr. Cox and Dr. Miranda are excellent. Very knowledgeable, ethical and professional and they’ve always managed to squeeze me in on busy days during an emergency and are very diligent about following-up and making sure I was out of pain. Kudos! Keep up the great work!<//Text>

I went in for a cleaning.  The treatment was excellent as usual and thanks to Dawn’s good work and suggestion to use a water pik, my gums are even better than they have been in a long time.  The office is sanitary and COVID-proof,  and everyone is doing just fine.  I’ve been going to Cox & Miranda for 36+ years and they never disappoint me.< /Text>

<text>Bad dentist. Stay away. Dr Miranda never warns you to do things in time even if you regularly visit him, he likes to make your issue get worse, and he waits for a big payday, when he can do complicated and expensive procedures when your tooth condition gets worse. Do yourself a favor and go to a dentist that gives you preventative feedback early</text><response>None</response>< Rating>

<username>Kim Fong< /username><Text>Thank you for for letting me see Dr. Miranda and Michelle again. Michelle was my hygienist before I left to see Dr. Matin who had to relocate as well. It was nice Michelle remembered me and went out of her way to accommodate my special needs and address my many dental concerns. Dr. Miranda made it simple to remember follow up instructions. The consistency in competent staff was helpful but I would have preferred the receptionist wait for me to submit insurance information instead of having me cover services on my own. The office is comfortable and easy to find.  They don’t have all the  instrumentation as before but otherwise they provide excellent care.<//Text>< Date>

< Review>
Just to let you know, I have a terrible phobia of dentists. I finally got the courage to proceed with dental surgery. In August,  I had a tooth extracted and two implants in one visit. Dr. Miranda was my surgeon and was so caring and patient.  His office has everything you need to know in the packet when you go to your pre-op. The prescriptions, the plan leading up to the surgery, and the after care needed. Dr. Miranda also plans out your surgery on the computer, before your surgery. The placement and size of the implant is determined ahead of time. He is so organized and professional. No pain just slight discomfort. Dr. Miranda has wonderful bed side manners. His nurse Natalie was the best nurse. She was very calming.
Also, he called me personally when I got home, to see how I was doing. He makes you feel so important and cared for.
I highly recommend Dr. Miranda.
Dr. Miranda is a 10 plus!<//Review>

As always, despite the pandemic, my experience at Cox and Miranda for a routine teeth cleaning, was exactly what it should be.  It was a sterile, clean environment.  My dental hygienist was professional and efficient.  Bottom line is that I felt safe, cared for and my teeth got clean.  Thank you.</Text>

<review>Understanding the precautions being taken for Covid, I was a bit disappointed in the cleaning procedure as it was all picking, no flossing and no polishing in order to prevent  producing an aerosol. I should have been told this in advance. There was no rinsing until  at the very end. I feel the  thoroughness of the cleaning of my teeth was not near as good as in the past but the charge was the same. In speaking to friends who have had their teeth cleaned elsewhere, a suction was set up near the mouth to take in any aerosol  produced allowing for the teeth to be cleaned as in the past. Maybe this can be considered at Dr. Cox's office. Overall, my wife and I were clearly disappointed at our teeth cleaning  procedure.<//review><user_id>106193307230988836822</user_id>< Pics>

<text>Dr Miranda is an outstanding dentist highly knowledgeable in complex medical conditions as they relate to oral treatments.  You can rely on him to treat teeth and gums under difficult conditions.  His hygienists are gentile and effective in cleanings.  The office takes sanitation very seriously in these covid times.<//text>< username>

<userid>101401223929056973494<//userid><time>1575224165154<//time><text>I have a chronic gum problem, and I was concerned about changing dentists, but we had moved and I needed someone closer.  My first appointment at Dr. Miranda’s clinic was much more than I expected.  The office staff is really conscientious, but always seems relaxed.  My review with Dr. Miranda showed me that he was knowledgeable (and detail oriented), personable and professional.  I’m never relaxed at a dentists office, but I can say that when I left him to move to my tooth cleaning, I was relaxed (and when I realized I was relaxed I was also surprised).  The hygienist was also very proficient.  When I told him I had sensitive gums, he took great care during the cleaning and I barely felt him working.  He also recommended a specific toothbrush which is the softest I’ve ever used.  The attendant working with Dr. Miranda also volunteered to clean my mouth guard ... the first time in 15 years of wearing mouth guards that the dentist office ever cleaned them!  In short, I very highly recommend the clinic of Drs. Cox and Miranda (though obviously my personal knowledge is only of Dr. Miranda).< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><name>Maria Bukowski</name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dr. Christian Miranda and Michelle, our hygienist are the Best. My husband and I have used their dental services for over 20 years and have always been satisfied with their technical knowledge,which extends into veneers, bonding even sleep apnea treatments! They and Dr. Cox and also personable and caring, making us feel welcome from the first. The best medical/dental relationship we've formed in the area.<//Text>< date>

<text>The office of Drs Cox and Miranda is taking every precaution during this time of Covid.  They have changed some of their protocols to insure both patient and staff safety.  I encourage others not to be concerned about going for routine check-ups or procedures.

Over the many years I have seen Dr. Cox and his team, they have always done a great job and were very competent.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808fa4cd15e124b1:0x3bcf1d1c048fb2ac<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Our family of 4 has gone to Dr Cox over 15 years.  My daughters each had different mouth & jaw issues.  They were very through, kind and understanding when it came to tracking down the problems.    Patient and persevering until  solutions were found.  They are still our family dentists.< /Text>

I am very happy with the service I receive from Dr. Miranda and his staff. My dermatologist recommended him for a condition that had been bothering me and that she felt a dentist could treat better than a doctor. He did. All better! Routine care is also excellent.</text>

Everything about Dr. Jim Cox and his loyal staff is outstanding - expertise, skill, latest technology, personal rapport, genuine connection with patients. I've traveled from out of state to receive care over the years - and grateful to know I am always under the very best of care.  If there were ten stars to give, that would be even better.< /review>

<review>My wife and I go to Dr. Cox for all our dental needs. Dr. Cox is very professional. We are happy with that.
Dr. Miranda is also part of the team there .He  should take the time to explain to the patients what his options are when it comes to big expensive treatments such as crowns.
Also the Front office girls preconceive the treatment. They say "Oh you need a crown" Let the professional Dentist decide what is the right treatment.
Another thing There are TV Monitors in the work place. That is a distraction from the cleaning persons doing their job properly. They may hurt the patient. They may  not clean the Teeth  well because they are watching TV.
These areas need improvement.< /review><Date>1553279259176< /Date><resp>None< /resp><rating>5<//rating><user_id>110786501811782919400</user_id>< Gmap_id>

There has been incidents where he is out of town to proceed with a procedure with him, forcing me to opt out to other dentist, the reason I will never go to anyone else is because Dr Miranda is honest, has a very gentle hand and he and his assistants will do anything to make you the most comfortable while being in an uncomfortable situation. Thank you Dr Miranda for everything you have done for my family and I, you are truly appreciated! Definitely recommend to anyone and everyone!</Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< username>

Been going here for years.  I think even before Google had a website?
I've never been happier with a dentist.  I'm usually with Dr. Miranda, but I've seen Dr. Cox a few times as well.
Everyone in the place really cares about the patients.  They all clearly enjoy working there.  Everyone's happy and does the best job they can.
I'm one of those people who's "scared of the dentist" but it is mostly the shots I don't like.  I had a cavity filled recently and it was the most painless shot I've ever had.  Dr. Miranda joked that "he'd been getting a lot of practice".< /Text>

Dr. Jim Cox has been my dentist for several years.  At first, we were dental colleagues together, taking special continuing education classes for treatment of occlusal (bite) problems.
As time passed, he became my general dentist, even doing sophisticated, state of the art surgery for my several implants.  Jim is the most compassionate and skilled dental professional I’ve ever met and he continually amazes me with the latest knowledge, concepts and procedures of modern dentistry.   As you would expect, Dr. Cox has assembled a wonderfully competent and caring staff, many of whom have remained with him for several years.  They too, are dedicated, loving and caring people and it is my constant joy and delight to greet them on my twice-yearly preventive care visits. I thank God for him in my life and my level of trust, when I’m in his hands, is second to none.  And for all he’s been able to accomplished for me, I’ll be eternally grateful.
I’m now retired from active practice and thanks to Dr. Cox, I still enjoy my favorite foods with a smile.   If you need a dentist, the Cox- Marinda group, must not be overlooked.

Dr. Cox and his staff are professional, competent and caring.  Dr. Cox has been my dentist for more than 20 years and I am always more than happy with his work.  I would recommend his office to anyone and everyone.   Also, Sanjay Malani has always done a great job as my dental hygienist.</Text>

Early, extremely pleasant, most thoughtful and courteous and makes going to the Dentist if not enjoyable almost so.  I recommend Dr. Cox and his staff very highly and without any reservations.<//Review>

Our family came to this dentistry when my son was small and had been terrorized by another dentistry which had used a ‘Papoose Board’ to keep him immobile during my son’s first exam.

Our family medical doctor recommended this dentistry and when we brought my son here, the staff discovered that the sound of the air suction device was the problem.  They just used rolled cotton, instead.  That was 21 years ago.

Now,  both wife and son have moved to another, more local, dentist.  I come here because I trust, and remember past service.<//Review>

I have been a patient of Dr. Cox's for more than 35 years, and have the highest possible opinion of his work product and work ethic. As well as crowns and bridges,  I have needed several root canals, and have NEVER - not once- experienced the post operative agonies related by those who go to other dentists.  I dread the day he retires and so never bring that up in conversation</Review>

<UserId.>108967552293711948376</UserId.><Text>First I want to say that I had made my appointment for 1pm and due to traveling across the bay and putting up with traffic, I made it to my appointment an hour and a half late and the front desk receptionist gals were super nice and very understanding of my sumituation for being late. Once I had all checked in, the Doctor (Mr. Cox) and staff were super profesional and honest with there process regarding my implant procedure. Just want to add prior to my visit-  that I had experienced extremely bad suggestions and services from three different Dental offices in the city of Lodi CA, and none of them were able to give me a solution to my broken implant screw (Abutment). Until I had found doctor ( Coxand Miranda DDS office) they are sincerely in my opinion the best Dental specialist that I had ever encountered. THANK YOU Doctor COX and Staff for helping me with my situation and bringing peace back into my life and for being very informative, supportive and most importantly for being honest.

Thank you!< /Text>< name>

<text>(Translated by Google) I am new to the USA and California, needing a Dentist can be intimidating in a new place. Having come into the hands of Dr Miranda and his entire team has been significantly positive.
I came to them for an emergency in a tooth that ended up being my first crown; Roger's attention to detail and patient sensitivity put me at ease. Doctor Miranda's professionalism, honesty, tact, clarity and attention to detail made me feel like I was in the best of hands.
At the level of treatment and explanation they were very clear, precise and kind.

Thank you for making me feel comfortable in a not so comfortable situation.
Impeccable work.

(Original)
Soy nueva en USA y en California, necesitar un Odontólogo puede ser intimidante en un lugar nuevo.   Haber llegado a las manos del Dr.Miranda y todo su equipo ha sido significativamente positivo.
Llegué a ellos por una emergencia en una muela que terminó siendo mi primera corona; la atención al detalle y la sensibilidad al paciente de parte de Roger me hizo sentir mucha tranquilidad. La profesionalidad, honestidad, tacto, claridad y atención al detalle de Doctor Miranda me hicieron sentir que estaba en las mejores manos.
A nivel de tratamiento y explicación fueron muy claros, precisos y amables.

Gracias por hacerme sentir cómoda en una situación no tan cómoda.
Impecable trabajo.< /text>< pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>My kids had the best time with this water slide. The company was extremely professional. My wife requested that they come early to set up and they made it happen. Scheduling with them was super easy and they even sanitized the water slide. The water slide was so big and amazing quality. My kids had the best time. We have used other companies and they were late or the product wasn't what was promised but this company was the best. Thank you Willows Wacko Bulls, we will be using you guys for every party from here on out!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2Zgn-xoMOg5mCVJQqG3wX1CH-bSTMjixXEnsU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Willows made my Birthday the best birthday ever. I rented one of their Mechanical Bulls and it was the best idea ever. Everyone had fun! The kids and the adults all took turns. It was great! This is something I think we all needed!  A little stress relief!  Thank you again!<//Text>

Super satisfied with their services! They were punctual and had very good communication. Polite and accommodating. A little issue came up (on my part) in not making enough space for them to set up the water slide and needed a bit more time to do so. With that being said, they were very understanding and agreed to squeeze our drop off a little later. Mind you, they didn't have to do so but they were kind enough too. Overall, got exactly what was described to us and what we paid for. Do not hesitate to book their services! If they offered more stars I'd give them more.<//Review>

Thanks so much for the mechanical bull it was so much fun. My godson really enjoyed it and so did the rest of the party including myself. The control panel was very easy to use so everyone was able to get on, from the toddlers to grandparents. I appreciated them for communicating before drop off and them picking up until next morning. Definitely recommend them.</review>

I was able to request a bull the day before my event with absolutely no problem. The price was super affordable and reasonable for the amount of time I had it. Delivered it with no hassle and cleaned/sanitized it for us. Overall it was a great experience for my family. We will be considering it again in the future.</review>

<review>I’ve been using Willow’s Waco Bulls for the past 5 years and will not rent from anyone else. They have everything you’ll need to make your party a hit! My kids love When I rent the Mechanical Bull and on these hot summer days the waterslides are our go too! I highly recommend using Willows Wacko Bulls they are by far the best In the industry!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I rented a mechanical bull for my birthday. They have good availability and great customer service. They sanitized the bull right after they set it up and showed me how to use it. Would definitely book again, highly recommend them! 10/5<//Review>

Rented a jack o lantern jumper for my son's bday  and he loved it ! Even adults were entertained by just looking at it , asking 100 questions about it, Where did you get it ? How much ? Did you buy it or rent it  ? Haha  it was a good day . My goal was to make my boy happy on his bday and this definitely helped me achieve that goal . Well Worth the price .
Thanks again willows waco Bulls for great customer service , being quick to respond , on time , reliable and for hooking me up last minute . See you next year !</Text>

The Boxing Ring was one of the most popular entertaining inflatable among our children, teenagers and adults we ever had. It came with 2 sets of large glives 2 sets of small gloves and kids head protectors. My family boxed and jumped all day and night. The boxing  ring was super clean. It was dropped off at the time we specified and pick up was in the early AM. I will definitely rent from Willos Wacko Bulls again and again. I would rate them 100 stars if possible.</text>

Andrew and his crew were totally professional!  After searching for a waterslide and being told no a friend told me about this company and thank goodness she did.  They didnt ask for a deposit so I just crossed my fingers and hoped they showed up and did they ever.  The waterslide was a hit!  The pricing was reasonable.   They showed up and set up quickly.  I'm very pleased with the service and will absolutely be using them for my next party.<//review>

<review>I found Willows Wacko Bulls, Waterslides on Instagram - I contacted them the day of my daughters High-school graduation - we normally rent waterslides for parties but this time we tried the mechanical bull. It was so much fun! The kids/teens/adults loved it, everyone had fun either watching someone ride or control the bull. I contacted them last minute and they responded quickly! I’m impressed with their service and friendliness! Thank you Waco Bulls!< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
It's one of the friendliest "hole in the wall" bars you will ever walk into. There are people there that will always buy you a drink. And the staff can talk to just about anyone.  There are a lot of locals that know each other, but there are friendly.</Review>

<text>The pioneer is an iconic watering hole for bikers and billionaires. It's been operating since the late 19th century. It's main attraction is the music program which has some of the greatest talent both local and national, featured on the small Dusty stage. This is a very casual place, often a destination by those on horse back-who park out back.  Weeknights, you might walk in and find a #1 artist playing the guitar to 5 people in the bar. On weekends, when big headliners like Dutch Uncle play, expect to mingle in a very packed bar with captains of industry from the local area, and the regular folk who are all there to party and enjoy life. Even for people who rarely get out, this is not a place to miss.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Came here mid-day on a Saturday and expecting a dive bar; got a biker bar instead. We decided to have a round anyways and the server was really rude. We went to the bar and she came by and asked what we wanted. After we pondered drinks for no more than 10 seconds, she sneered and walked away to serve another customer, as if the place was crackin' (there were 7 people at the bar). The actual bar is really beautiful, with seemingly original walls and ceiling and a stained glass window. However, the overall vibe is aggressive and intense, and not what I want out of a dive bar. I think most of the reason I didn't like it was that the crowd and atmosphere are just not ones I prefer in a drinking establishment, but to each their own. Regardless, the service was inexcusable.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
This is the only fast food restaurant in this plaza that I can find with a covered patio during a rainy day. The chicken burrito I got was fine, the service was fast and friendly, and the price is reasonable. Nothing extraordinary but meets my normal expectation of a taqueria.< /Review>

<review>Of all the Una Mas and La Salsa locations I have patroned, this place is, by far, THE WORST. I thought these restaurants all had the same standard of quality, but I was wrong. I’v been to this location three times, just to see if the first two visits were random bad days. However, I  learned that this place is consistently bad and I think they know it, but really don’t care, ever. The service was semi-friendly, until I started asking questions or wanted condiments. The food quality was extremely poor, each time, relative to the other La Salsa location. The tables weren’t wiped clean. Note: my experiences at this La Salsa were all during pre-pandemic lockdown.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Would definitely recommend trying this place.
Big portions for the price and quality food.
U have to try the chips and guacamole and make sure to get the green guac sauce too it's amazing!!< /Text>

Located in Town Center, La Salsa had only one person working there. We had a Two beef tacos, chicken enchiladas, and a chicken salad. All dishes were huge. We took home leftovers. The salsa bar had a mango salsas, avocado salsa, green salsas, hot red, and very spicy habanero salsa. Not the restaurant or property management fault, looking out the window, a butt crack from homeless digging in garbage, and came in selling cd for $7 Bart fare and I donated $5 reluctantly. The homeless person is over 6 feet tall and somewhat intimidating. Won't be coming back anytime soon.</text>

< review>
I ordered a Chicken Chile Lime salad thru menustar and when I arrived I told the person behind the counter I was there to pick up my online order. He asked what I ordered I told him the Chile Lime Salad. He gave me a back that had 2 containers and some salsa. When i got out to the car I noticed there was soup in the bag so I went back inside and told the 3 men standing there that they got my order wrong. Once of the guys appeared to be a manager said no that is what you ordered it comes with a soup you ordered soup and salad. He said it just looks different. The confirmation I printed only showed how much I paid not my order so I came all the way back to Daly City to find out my order was in fact wrong. If they had checked instead of insisting that the order was correct they would have realized they gave me someone else's order. Nothing worse than when your hungry and you get the wrong food. Even worse they didn't even bother to check and make sure the order was correct and they were giving it to the right person.</review>

I can say that not all La Salsa Restaurants are the same but this particular location is not my favorite. The cashier was nice but the restaurant was filthy. The place was empty and there was food on the floor, stains everywhere, mold under the salsa bar. I sat there and was trying to eat and I couldn’t even finish my food. I NEVER waste food but I couldn’t eat the three tacos I ordered because I was afraid I might get sick. If the simple things are off, I can’t imagine the food is being adequately taken care of. I left and will not return.</Text>

As a cook, I greatly value my days off. Spending one huddled in bed with food poisoning so bad I'm dry heaving is so far outside of what I want to do with my precious little free time that I don't have words to describe how upset I am. I'd rate this place in the negatives if it were possible.< /Review>

<review>OVA great., been fortunate that most times I've dropped by there was no or short line.
In my opinion for what it is..its mucho grande above the mall's Chipotle. Better quality food for about same price. The service is generally good. The only real pain is having to navigate to their restroom in back..BUT glad it has one at all. IF you got time or in area it's worth going to to check it out your self. Maybe if  shopping in area and want to avoid the food court scene. OR if your out by your lone some dove self and decide red lobster is too much for one and want better than fast food burgers than id recommend this place.</review>< pictures>

<review>I really am sorry to be a downer but this Museum sucks. It is literally one room with a partition in the middle that you walk around.  The only thing worth seeing there is Ishi's artifacts, the Egyptian sarcophagus and the Greek pottery.

I didn't mind spending the $6 a person to go see ishi artifacts however, they don't have them all out.  That was the only reason we went to this Museum.  At the time I was there they only had out the arrowheads he made of glass.

The funny thing is there's a sign on the wall talking about how they have 3.8 million artifacts. When we asked for these were, we were told they were under the museum and they only bring them out from time to time.

We were very disappointed.  I'm sure glad we didn't drive farther than we did to go here.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7xDM8h_6rUysG97zhoBuFiYOCXVVaa0V2soxz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfZ14cQ2Cb3XosftxvX97NwXq-obzELewr2X3P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb9QXVTPWRoJ_9sRJnMEym1D78gR42Jd5WRMFO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDOYyhEBPFi_-kAl9qlkTO8x7UphCkNkeT6Nt1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8LAVoETUBvJ1hEcK0okdRAEwGvwXKbzdZeliw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoA8d4Dmq2iwA8H4jab1DvAWxVC9NJwFKtSi6r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTi-BhGGyjWM7sIPNdedl9g1c44qym2aD2GB4q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO59QVXuTBYTQSUFJMStMgNIuDE3ZBR_dqqypNP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDZpQ7lIah__RvdFTpegOpHvy-RUB48SRP9BP-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjK10JE9IFGiYMIAyrNUj-YDOynzslgoczd4P6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80857c2ff43fffff:0x16e9d5abee8317b9< /Gmap_id></record>

Hoped to see some artifacts from their extensive polynesian collection but the current exhibit featured just one kava bowl. And this with a questionable explanation: the chord was used to hang it up when not used - ? To my knowledge it resembled an umbilical chord connecting the participants of the kava ceremony spiritually with the gods.<//Text>

Very small museum with no real theme. The curation really needs work. Some interesting pieces but the presentation seems contrived in a bad way. Feels like a bunch of Berkeley students went on a backpacking trip without knowing that they will be forced to put pieces for this museum.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80857c2ff43fffff:0x16e9d5abee8317b9<//Gmap_id></record>

After such a long time being closed for remodeling you would think the museum would be bigger. However, it seems smaller than before. The old gift shop with the folk art is gone too. It’s a shame they don’t display more of their huge collection for the public to see.< /review>

Broadway Army Store, is a great Military Surplus store.  This isn't your father's store.  They have all the latest clothing, and tactical equipment you will need.  Every service branch
is represented.  Check out their Voodoo Brand of Backpacks.  Ask for Reuben, tell him Curtis sent you. 👍🇺🇸<//Text>

Great store to shop at while I was in the area. I had to treat myself to some toys and this cool hat before I did a security gig for the "Insane Clown Posse Concert" at the Pershing Square in DTLA. It's was a great experience. I got soaking wet in "Faygo Cola" working the pits. I had lots of fun with ICP and the fans.< /text>

For convenience this is a good story but you they charge double maybe triple for the same thing at another store. I tried buying a badge the lady told me $25 and then I showed them the place where they buy there merchandise from, it said that the badge was $9.99 and I ask if they could bring down the price a little, and the man said "No its $25 that's it. I don't mind paying a little more for convenience and understanding the the store needs to make a little profit but not when the price is double or triple. the other stores a little bit farther to go to and it's only open on the weekdays but I think I'll wait it'll be worth it.</Review>

I have been shopping at this retail store for several years. Everytime I go there the entire staff provide to me the most  amazing customer service I can ever experience. Right away they not only acknowledge you when you walk through their door but right away let you know that if you need some assistance let them know so they can help you find something even if you don't know why you are in there. Tremendously excellent customer service. Thank you young man (Ruben) for always going out an beyond your way to make sure me and my staff are taken care of buddy.

(Translated by Google) Store rubbish, they tell you a price and if you don't let yourself Steal they make you that is how the supposed owner treats me ... she is not courteous, she is not friendly and to have business you need many good manners, something that the store does not have I bought from her previously $$ 1000 dls in merchandise if it is known I do not buy anything unscrupulous people ...... I absolutely do not recommend it ... thanks

(Original)

(Translated by Google) Excellent site for purchases of articles and accessories of the army, police and security
Backpacks of different sizes for different services or activities
Similarly from appliques or souvenirs to uniforms or total accessories
Space a little reduced but a very good attention unfortunately the payment can only be done in cash or with cards with an ID card backup

It's my favorite spot in town for after hours tacos. But I been there three times in a night each time I came they told me they were closed and to come back later. Well it never opened at the time the sign on the door said they would. So next time I came back they still weren't open. That's foul. Fix your selves. Love you thanks.< /text>

<text>Hola, one of the few places (maybe the only place available for a late night snackl) to eat a hot meal meaning it's served hot , not spicy unless you requested that way.  Although the location can be a little intimidating it's worth the stop. The food is fresh and ample. The service is attentive and pleasant.Try the nachos there's plenty for two people and well priced, too. Do keep in mind, not all La Villa restaurants are the same in terms of service and quality. Enjoy the food; it's filling.<//text><gmap_id>0x80ea6a55915744f9:0xc48b01a36aa2de78</gmap_id>< response>

Service was a little long but I'm not holding it against them, the food however makes up entirely for it. I haven't tasted food like that since my mother cooked for me.</Text>

<text>Very Unprofessional service by the Clerk. An Older Lady who was working at 11 o'clook pm yesterday had no experience in customers services or any manners while me and my wife placed our Orders...Her poor attitude made us feel uncomfterable .. We over heard her Insults/ trash talking about us while we were waiting for our food, as if we did not Speak Spanish... But of course I spoke up defending our Honor and Respect because im a Paying Costomer.. Now i know I  Rather eat at a taco truck down the street from them them because the simple fact that we were not Discriminated....Thank you an God Bless<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Usually I prefer any other place than La Villa but this time they were pretty legit. Bomb burrito, hooked up fat, and the tacos I ordered were pretty good too. Went here past 230am and was so worth it! Totally recommend as you won't be disapointed with La Villa being your only late night Taco option.<//Text>

Food was ok I ordered a asada burrito but not worth the price but not bad and the customer serves is the worst! Cashier was awful I visited with my disabled patient and she was really rude. Dont think I'll be coming back here.</Text>

Food has a decent flavor but the meat isn't cut properly so when you take a bite you get a huge chunk of meat a lot of the time.  Very stingy with the cilantro, it's all pretty much onion and if you ask for just cilantro they say it's all mixed.<//text>

<time>1459929905724< /time><text>I do not know where to start. Ok I know the smell! It was horrible I could barley withstand waiting in line. It smelled like dead rodents. Also I saw the food coming out to the customers and it looked disgusting and bland. I opted for just a Jaimaica instead. The cashier stared at me said ok. And instead of just ringing me out and getting the water to get me on my way, she starts pulling orders out and packing them up with no sense of urgency. Slowest I've ever seen. I'm still waiting to get rung out maybe 5 minutes. A gentlemen comes up thinking I already ordered and asked her for a drink. She quickly rings him out. I had to just walked away. The smell and rude service was too much to bear. CALLING A HEALTH  INSPECTOR.</text></record>

(Translated by Google) I loved the tacos. Maybe the other time I go, I ask if they can put guacamole or avocado in the tacos. The cashier was very good people and I loved that she made us talk because in other restaurants the cashiers are very dry

<Review>(Translated by Google) What a disappointment to have come to this place! Your employees lack information on how to take health and hygiene MEASURES ... the minutes that I wait for my order, I see that the cook touched his face twice, one of the cashiers washed his hands incorrectly. this crisis.

(Translated by Google) The gut tacos were cold and there was no more than a customer, there are no excuses that they were very busy, they have a good place, it was clean but they do NOT really want to and sincerely do not return, apart my 11 year old daughter ate roast tacos with
Hotcheetos and nacho cheese were good but sadly sick of the stomach.

(Original)
Los tacos de tripa estaban fríos y no avía más que un cliente , no hay excusas de que estaban muy ocupados, tienen un buen lugar ,estaba limpio pero NO le echan ganas y sinceramente no regreso,  aparte mi hija de 11años comió tacos de asada con
hotcheetos y queso de nacho estaban buenos pero se enfermo del estomago lamentablemente.😔< /text>
