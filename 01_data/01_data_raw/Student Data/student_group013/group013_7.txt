I thought more highly of Jasen in the past.  And the reason for that is, I asked the receptionist that I wanted to speak with him personally.  Not on one occasion, but on three.  Yes three (3).  He never returned my phone call.  To me this is totally unacceptable!  He is my agent, we pay Allstate in FULL on ALL our statements and he does NOT have the courtesy to return a call!<//Review>

This "family agency" is the reason insurance agents get a bad reputation. Some of the reviews on here are from the agents in the office, no wonder they have good reviews. You call that honesty?</review>

< Review>
I had a bad experience with Feltman Family Ins Agy.  I purchased Auto insurance with Allstate online and after paying, it assigned Feltman Family Ins Agy as my local agent. Since the policy could not be activated until March 29, 2021, I called FeltmanFamily Ins Agy and asked to speak with Jason Feltman. The lady who picked up the phone told me Jason is the owner, did not identify her name just told me they will not receive the policy until 10 days later and if I purchased the auto policy from them instead purchased online then she can help me; then she just hung up. She also shouting over the phone.  I would like purchase auto insurance from Feltman Family Ins agy.<//Review>

When I first conducted business via phone with Alejandro he was always kind, professional, and effective.
Although, my goal was to lower my insurance rates,  he at least had the answer on why that would not be possible.
What I appreciated the most was his patience. During the enrollment process I became assiduously busy.  We kept playing phone tag, When  my deal was finalized I felt as though I had a new friend.</text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>WORSE INSURANCE BROKER EVER

ABSOLUTELY the WORSE Insurance Broker we have ever worked with.

They completely mess up my Auto policies, then continued to messed up EVEN MORE on our homeowner policies. We were in the middle of REFINANCING our properties, the agent decided to extend the new insurance policies with our NEW & Potential Lender instead of our current and existing lenders.  Now we are facing insurance cancellations from our existing lenders and additional insurance payments from Allstate.  What a joke.!!! The Agent, Rita messed it all up and the supervisor( Miguel) further delayed and amplified the scenario.  Finally, Jason, the manager failed to resolve the issues.  It must be a complete circus at the office, no one know how to solve problems when they arise.  They are all insurance clerks who take your money and get a commission.  Stay away as far as you can from this outfit....we will be notifying the California Insurance Commission.  Hopefully these clowns will be re-educated to do their professional job correctly.....so the people won't need to deal with this level of ignorance as we had to.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Jason was a pleasure to work with and was happy to go over my coverages with me. When I have a question on my auto insurance renewal, Jason is always there to answer. I switched from State Farm to this Allstate office and will never look back! I’m finally in good hands with Allstate!!!!< /Text>

<review>746 Condos in this association.  Plentiful pools scattered all over the property.  Great food and beverages with Happy Hour, Taco Tuesday, Lunch and Dinner at the Clubhouse (in season) and the year round Grille which is open for breakfast and lunch daily.  Fitness center, game nights, shows....not a 55+ property, there's something for everyone!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Unprofessional and liars came here because I needed my account pin to switch phones and the guy (I think him and his wife are owners of the store) told me I had to have a year with my account in order to get my pin. Which is bs because I've had metro pcs for years and never had a problem to obtain my pin when I needed it. I went to a different metro store that same day and got my pin in minutes.<//Text>

Please avoid this establishment at all costs, Sadly the people who work here are the owners and they actually live directly above the establishment. THEY ARE SCAMMERS. They do low ball work. Illegal at that. Please avoid this establishment. I was having issues with my phone and I took it to a different Metro, turns out. There was a TRACKING DEVICE. My lawyer will serve them soon. They were they only establishment that had done work inside my phone.<//review>

Chris the Owner and Ricky an Employee and Victoria an Employee are AMAZING!!! Out of the Metro PCS stores I've been to I've never met such AWESOME PATIENCE with these 3 people!!! I 100% recommend that you come here for your service. They are inexhaustible!!! I was in the store for hours yet they had no issues with helping me. All I can say is that the quality of care and respect and patience and kindness would be compared to V.I.P. treatment!!! I challenge anyone to come here to try and prove me wrong!!!<//text>

Terrible customer service, they treat there customers very poorly and they do shady things here. Please go somewhere else. The owner is very rude, very stuck up and prideful. The services are VERY overpriced. Please don’t leave your phone here. Sometimes he’ll ask you to leave your phone to perform services but PLEASE don’t. Go to a Metro where they’ll actually want to help you. At this place they are trying to take advantage of you.</review>

Bandidos! Very unprofessional. The store reeked of tobacco and They overcharge for their services and then made me pay money pretty much for nothing which has never happened at a legit metro. Son unos bandidos y no valen la pena. Servisio terrible personal sin integridad. No worth it! Go anywhere else. They are scumbags< /review>

Becareful with getting an account here guy claiming to be named "Ricky" says he could access anyone's account without without their pin as long as they've gotten the phone there! That is absolutely incorrect! I've worked for METROPCS for years and that is not accurate!! That is past customer security! We do not access customers  accounts without their pin! He claims he could switch the plan without that! Becareful with these ppl! Then he says I am not buying anything to leave.< /review>< pics>

<review>Are you basic batch? Are you trying to snag one? Is getting white girl wasted something you do regularly? Do you miss your hometown where hitting the club actually meant you might get arrested/some butt/into a fight? This is as close as you're gonna get to it in Arcata. ProTip: if you DO snag somebody head north there's WAY better street lighting along G and H st's you can double check that you're not bringing home a Yeti. Hand Solo > Chewbacca< /review>< Pictures>

Place was packed, beers were cheap, had a good time. But the Hispanic bartender there was a complete A hole. Completely disrespectful for absolutely no reason. I just don’t get it, if you hate to interact with people get a job where you won’t have to.<//review>

<Review>Been here twice, first time was super crowded and hot and stuffy with the drinks being super watered down. Second time I went in I ordered a Bloody Mary to which to bar tender told me she only makes those in the morning since it's a day time drink. Customers only seem to bother these people there are other bars in Arcata I'd recommend any over this one.< /Review>< pictures>

The security at this bar is aggressive and rude. This staff overall is disrespectful to even the most respectful customers. The security is extremely physical and aggressive with people who are not causing any trouble.< /text>

< Review>
Never been more disrepectd by a, "so called employee" first of all we don't have are gf's sitting in are lap, kissing while working. I was minding my own business having a great time with friends, I accidentally bumped Into this "so called employee's gf." .....because bring your gf to work day is a thing, am I right?. After I had accidentally bumped into this person, I proceed with apologizing senserly .well it seems the bouncer needed to take things further, as he proceeded with rude uncalled remarks, acting very out of line for an employee, looked as if he may have been on drugs. I proceed to go an talk to a other employee that may have more of a level head on their shoulders.when i was about to let him know, "So called employee that brings his gfs to work" put his hands on me and aggressively removed me from the bar, as well as drawing blood by cutting my finger. I have never been more disrespected by a employee for literally doing nothing. This individual needs to be reprimanded an removed from his post. You now loose another very good paying guests.<//Review>

It's wild on Thursday evenings! $2 cover charge, but definitely worth the $2 pints on anything thats on tap. With $10, you can have yourself a forgettable night.< /Review>

A sports-bar by day and the closest thing Arcata has to a nightclub by night.

On Friday and Saturday night be prepared to pay a $2 cover for entry into a bar full of college students and young adults. They have the only dance floor in town that plays top 40, hip hop, and dub step. Most weekends you can find this place packed with all kinds of different people.

This should be a 3 star bar for the weak drinks, but I gave them 4 stars for security. There are some bars in Humboldt I don't feel comfortable going to because there are too many bar fights and that ruin the night. Sidelines has amazing security! Many of them play Football at HSU and use their size to keeping the peace.<//Text>

<review>We left the bar last week with one of our friends bleeding from his face with three fractured teeth, after being Held down by the bouncers, and beaten repeatedly then dragged out. The Bouncers are known to frequently assault patrons. Other employees, and owners of the bar defend, and stand by these actions by refusing to return the victims phone calls, and withhold names of bouncers, resulting in yet more assaults.<//review>< userid>

Least shady of the bars on the plaza, pool tables, sports, etc. It's the kind of place that has padding on any posts so drunk people don't hurt themselves, but at least beers are in glass not Solo cups.<//text>

<Review>Horrible blow out of our right passenger tire on hwy 10, 25 miles away from, Blythe. After putting the mini spare on, we called Joe’s Tires, spoke to the nicest guy named, Adrian, and made it to town. Adrian and Oscar took just a few minutes to put on a fresh tire and on our way we went. Best service. Adrian was exceptional with knowledge and costs.
Thank you!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80d1393ad42c6d63:0xcf9e49f81ef6e174</Gmap_id>< Rate>

<text>Went there thinking my truck needed a new tire. I don't drive the vehicle much. So when I found it flat I figured I need a new tire. Went there the gentleman was very polite and honest. Cone to find out no leaks  or holes. He air up the tires and barely charge me. Awesome place and honest employers</text>< response>

Joe's Tires was super friendly and helpful with replacing two of my tires. Fast service, great pricing. I called 20 minutes before closing and asked for a quote and if they had time before they closed and they said yea come on down. They even stayed 10 minutes after to help me and did'nt seem to mind. $45 each. Very pleased. Highly recommended.Thanks guys!<//text>

Awesome!   We were traveling through and our tire blew without having a very good flat.   We called them when we were 10 minutes away and they closed in 5.   When we pulled up, they were still open and waiting for us with our tire ready.   Did not seem upset or distraught at having to stay an extra few minutes; seemed more happy to help.   Checked all the tire pressures (including the spare), gave us a great used tire that looked almost new and we left with them - and us - smiling.    Great people.< /Text>

Noticed that something was wrong with a tire while driving on the freeway. Had it checked out at Joe's right away and found that it started bulging out. The tire change was fast and we where on our way.<//review>

<Review>At first he was nice didnt have the right size for our mini van but had some that would work. We had driven about 5 hrs from out of town ended up with flat had to go eat with my two little ones one (being autistic she can be difficult when frustrated)ate then called Joe's totell them we were on the way back he said they were closed I said this web site says they are open till six it was a bit after five. He said no they close earlier on weekends.. i said its friday.. he said well its the end of the week...and well sorry  you were here earlier.. ( basically  We should have stayed ) and he  would have to take care of us tomorrow... I was like I'm sorry I thought u were open per ur web site< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The donut are delicious. They are fluffy, still warm and melts in your mouth. The oil they cook the donuts in is fresh. No burnt taste at all. The owners are very sweet
If your heading to Yosemite or visiting someone at Mercy Hospital you must stop here and get a box. You will not be disappointed. They're breakfast ham, egg & cheese croissant is a favorite.< /text>

I stopped by as I returned home from a camping trip. It was around 5am, I didnt know anything more than the sign read " open" and the reviews were generally good.  I walked in and they were making the donuts fresh right before my eyes! the layout is open and the kitchen visible from the counter, nothing to hide here.

I ate three raised donuts, that morning, two plain glazed and one maple, and they were practically perfect.  I dream of those donuts often, and hope this wild ride of life brings me there once more.</review>

Super friendly and quick service. Donuts fresh, competent, and good value. We fed my mom a birthday-breakfast Apple fritter that she loved, and the moist, dense, not-too-sweet cake almost won over my die-hard team-raised daughter. Merced is increasingly a college town; we were in and out quickly but I really appreciated the zero-hipster vibe, without a hint of intolerance from the regulars. Part of why I love the valley!<//review>

Better than any donut place I’ve ever tried. Better than the best donut shop in America. Donuts are always fresh, never have any trouble with staff. Better get there early to beat the morning rush!< /Text>

Gotta say, discovering Rollen Donuts was a truly delicious surprise.

Everything is fresh and made right there behind the counter. The jelly donuts are filled right in front of you. Fresh and wonderful, all in a friendly family-run store.

Even the savoury croissants are delicious.

And the prices are ... extremely friendly on the wallet.< /text>

Cooking and service areas are dirty. It brings to question the cleanliness of the food products they sell. The price is not competitive in comparison to other donut shops in Merced that sell better quality.<//text>

Friendly staff warm fresh and delicious donuts that practically melt in your mouth.... They open at 5am I suggest you get there before local law enforcement wipes them out haha jk but the donut holes are no joke. Best donuts for miles in my opinion< /Text>

<text>Rollen Donuts is my favorite donut shop here in Merced California it's better than Yum Yum's are any other want to be donut shop I love rollen donuts especially like at between 5 and 7 a.m. Because the donuts are fresh and soft and they just melt-in-your-mouth practically and it goes great with McDonald's coffee cuz coffee is only a dollar at McDonald's for any size so it's Grand<//text></record>

I must have been very hungry the last time I gave it a 4 stars. I bought
the regular "hutuu Nam Vang" if I remember correctly but it's the same broth whatever you order on their menu except the Thai soup then they threw in a lot of chilis. It didn't have much of a taste, I got PO they didn't give me any liver, they gave a whole bunch of chewy heart pieces, they were tougher than my leather boots, they would have pulled out all my teeth if I dare try to eat it. I also ordered "xiquach" cooked pork bones, they were also tasteless, I guess I should stick w beef Xi quach. It was a disappointment. The boss was nice though and parking was plenty but I'm not coming back here, bad food mall and bad supermarket.< /Review>

My favorite Hủ Tiếu Thanh Xuân style (dry rice noodles with tomato sauce) in town! Price are reasonable and drinks are particularly cheap with their buy one drink get one free! They also have hot pots which I haven't tried.</review>

<review>Terrible service. I ordered Mì Hoành Thánh, but they messed up my table ticket and gave out another dish. I told one of the servers what I ordered and he got confused like he doesn't even know the menu. Then he asked me what would I want them to put in my noodle bowl, I then said "I ordered Mì Hoành Thánh from the menu, why are you asking me about how the food should be made?" He  brought me a bowl of noodle with 3 fried wonton on top. I got tired of arguing so I just ate it and told myself not to come back here ever again.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Great place for hu tieu nam vang. You choice between dry or in soup and different noodle options. I go with dry with thin rice noodle. Throw extra chrysanthemum greens in with the noodles and go to town. It's affordable and good. You could also order a soup bowl of bone with marrow or yao tieu/Chinese fried dough for a few bucks more.

Also tried the hot pot which I think is a solid deal for a lot of food. I prefer hu tieu though.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
After seeing so many + reviews on Yelp and Google, we decided to stop by and try their Hu Tieu. Sadly this is one of the worst Hu Tieu we ever had. Only the "soft" noodles version is available, not the "chewy" ones. We ordered our noodles with the broth served separately. The broth was so salty, the protein ingredients accompanying the noodles are plain and tasteless.
Either you don't know better what is good Hu Tieu, don't fall for the false reviews. Very disappointed!<//review>

< Review>
Good hu tieu, forgot to bring cash, but thankfully there is an ATM around the corner. There is a bit of a language barrier. Good food for the price, the Thai tea has a nice flavor, to be perfectly honest I'm not sure what gives it it's flavor. Not the best on customer service due to the language barrier, but we were provided with everything we needed to enjoy our meal and not asked every five minutes how the meal is, so on the flip side it was nice to enjoy our meal in peace. The fresh basil, cabbage, and bean sprouts was good.</Review>

The Burger House is ok. I have had better quality burgers for a better price. Beside the price, the burgers are tasty. Burger House is a good place to grab beers, food, and socialize with friends. Its definitely a good option for refueling after a concert.<//Review>

The loaded fries can use some work, you're fine with the garlic fries of you're trying to get fancy. But honestly, you won't find any burgers out at the bigger sit down restaurants. Eureka, Slater's etc. don't have anything in these seasoned ground chuck beef patties</Review>< name>

This was the perfect burger spot, and it breaks my heart to see it closed down. Best burgers around with an extremely friendly staff. I don't know where they got their ground beef from but the quality was off the charts. Man I miss this place..<//review>

If I could give zero stars I would. the service has changed a lot. They forgot our drinks even after asking continously and half of our order the tables were dirty the fries were cold!! I am a very patient person but this place made me loose it I didn't tell them anything but for me to take my time to make a review like this shows how disappointed and aggravated I was about this place.< /Review>

Came here the other week. They were out of a few items on the menu, like onion rings and a they were not serving beer, Wife tried to order a pulled pork sandwich, out of that too. A well run restaurant should never run out of stock. That should have been our first clue. We both ordered one of the burgers on the menu with fries. Burger was bland, didnt have any real flavor to it. Was susposed be cooked medium... came out well done. for a 12$ premium price point I would expect a lot more.  For a bill of close to 30 dollars ( 2 burgers and tip) SAVE your money and go else where.  Half of the fries were mushy, like they were really old.  Wait staff was nice and friendly, so we tipped accordingly.  After leaving on our way out noticed the yellow sign in the window for ownership change... so liquor licence was being update, but we were not told that... If you're looking for a premium burger joint, I'd go elsewhere.<//Review>

<gmapID>0x80c32de510cf07d3:0xc715e2afe8deb220<//gmapID><review>Pleasantly surprised about this little gem hidden in Pomona! I really wish there was one in LA....maybe one day.  The vibe here is super chill and the service was awesome. Our waitress was super sweet and very diligent.

We came in here two different times in the same day it was just that awesome. I had the Fall Harvest Cider on both occasions and was undeniably in love.  The cider had notes of pumpkin that subtly sweet but not as much as an apple cider. It provided a nice buzz as well!

The food here is also as exotic as its beers/ciders. The menu pairs every item with the perfect beer, how convenient. I had the Stinking Rose Fries which had this amazing garlic butter drizzled upon it. My brother has the bacon burger and loved it! I was far too full off the cider to even delve into the burgers. They did have a Crust Crab burger worth mentioning. I will have to make another trip for this fascinating sounding burger.

If you share a picture of your experience via Instragram, Facebook or Twitter then you get a percentage off. Not sure exactly but it was about a dollar or so off the entire bill.  It's certainly worth checking out if you're in the area. They have plenty of big screens so it's perfect for sport gazing.<//review><username>Jenelle Bossett</username><rate>4< /rate>< UserId.>

Overpriced just like its competition across the way. The burgers weren't 13 dollar-worthy and the waitress spent most of her time talking to some couple about arizona which is neat and all but 15 minutes for a simple refill is a bit silly.
That said the place seems to be all about beer. So if you're looking for beers and a burger....Go to O'douls right down the street who doesn't charge you starbucks tier prices for your drink and 13 bucks for a burger.< /review>

Food: 5/5 stars
Yum. Gourmet burgers. House made Pastrami duck on burger with mustard aioli... (My mouth hurts just from saying that! And having to take a bite out of such a thick burger). Must be a foodie word... "Aioli." Cooked perfect medium.  The black and blue cheese burger was also excellent. Darn fine garlic fries. Good selection of tap beer.  Maybe its the beer typing right now.

Atmosphere: 5/5 stars
Brickwalled, Casual, industrial, trendy warehouse conversion to bar feel type of place. 4 TVs on four walls with sport Chanel. Toe tapping Bob Marley music playing over the speakers (with sub woofer for some fine bass lines).... Buffalo soldieeeeeeers.... (Calling all audiophiles).

Service: 5/5 stars
I couldn't decide on beers. The waitress (Melodie, a fine women) recommended a few ..... And brought me samples.  10 stars.

Expense: 4/5 stars
5% discount for posting picture on FB. Even so it was $20+ for food, drink, tax, tip per person. A bit high for burgers, but... It was a gentrified fusion gourmet burger, so there!

Return: 5/5 stars
I have already returned. So there.<//review>

<review>This may be one of the finer burger houses this side of LA, and definitely worth hitting up if you're in the area for one of the Artwalks or other slew of events that go on in this bustling part of P-Town.

The space is modest, but always hopping, with sports aplenty being shown on every wall. The booze menu is amazing, and being a sweets lover myself, I have to say their list of ciders is up there with the best. Their Summer Blueberry Cider and Pineapple Cider are every sweet tooth's dream come true. If you're a stout lover, like my crazy friend, you will love their Voodoo Stout; with it's robustness and hefty alcohol content, it may sneak up on you, depending on how high your tolerance is. They also have plenty of wine for the connoisseurs who enjoy the finer things in life, and craft beers for those who... well, don't. And don't even get me started on everything they have on tap.

Regardless of what you decide to drink- and trust me, you have a wall's worth of drinks to choose from- the food is probably the biggest reason to come. The burgers, in particular, pack a lil' something extra to make your visit memorable. If you want my advice, try the Cremini Mushroom Burger, which brings together the juiciness of high-quality beef, the savoriness of sauteed mushrooms & caramelized onions, and... wait for it... the sweetness of Goji. Berry. Jam. It is one delicious burger. Throw in some pretzel sticks with a side of their melty cheese sauce, or onion rings, and let's not forget the free milkshake with your Yelp check-in for dessert, and you have yourself the perfect nighttime binge meal.

But, yeah, the booze is amazing.< /review>< user>

<Review>Ok, these are two stars, one from my wife and one from me.

Fries 🍟 tasted cruel, as they were ten or more years old. The sandwich and the burger were lets say regular. The coke tasted like old feet.

No 👎 we won't come back...< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

< Review>
Ive been coming to this shop and Dallin for the last 4 years and 50+ hours of tattooing. This shop is super clean and full of friendly people. I highly recommend anyone looking for a tattoo shop here in the high desert to check it out.<//Review>

Just hearing how a place of  business runs there studio especially somewhere that deals with beauty and expressiveness that is permanent is enough to pass. .. not to mention I WILL TELL ANYONE WHO WANTS ART DONE TO NEVER GO HERE. .EVER!  SHAME ON YOU ART JUNKIES... WORD OF MOUTH WILL HURT YOUR BUSINESS... GROW UP ! TREAT YOUR CUSTERMERS THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED! IF THIS IS HOW YOU WANT TO BE TREATED SO BE IT.< /Text>

Most of the artists and the receptionist are friendly, but it's because of the management's attitude towards customer service that I can no longer recommend Art Junkies, especially when there are so many great options in the nearby area.

My wife went in to get a tattoo from another shop fixed, and was very specific that a certain part was not to be touched- it was the only part she liked on the original. For some reason, the artist did that part anyways and it looked so bad that people commented on it! I went into the shop and talked to one of the artists who told me that we had three options: laser removal to get the part lightened then fixed, trying to lighten it with white ink or trying creams- I told him that we would try the laser option. My wife also posted her displeasure on their facebook page, but it was removed. This would have been a great time for them to tell us about the "hidden" requirement to show the owner the tattoo before getting the work done, but this didn't happen.

So my wife had several painful laser sessions before we go in to have the tattoo looked at for repairs. That's when they tell us that the repair will be new work because "we didn't show them first!" Even though I came in before the sessions, at no time were we told to do that and that was never given as a condition. The owner only added this requirement after the fact, even though we were acting on THEIR advice and doing exactly what we were told. All we wanted was the parts that weren't supposed to be done in the first place fixed, but the owner refused even though they made the error.

Ultimately, after much argument, we were given a refund for the original work. It's a shame, because we had intended on getting several more pieces done there. I suppose it wasn't worth it to the owner.<//Text>

Very unpleasant experience. The only thing that was good about this place was the music they were playing. Other than that, this is the least professional studio I've ever seen. This was my tenth piece, and I'll never go back to this place.< /review>

i got staff infection cause of one of the artist there and it wasn't even a big piece it was small/medium. ive never been dug out so bad where i had to have numbing cream. and the floor manager which is the blonde chick was rude as hell. she was trying to blame me for my staff infection. i cleaned it well and cared for it with auqaphor. it took 3 months to heal after the conceive bleeding and pus coming out everyday. will not ever go back again. not recommended...< /Review>

Very disappointed... What tattoo shop closes at 6pm on a Friday night? Starting rates $150 for something small... Let's just say I won't be back</text>

< Review>
Took my mother in law I for a hair cut. She was very pleased with Diva. Sorry. Hope I didn’t misspell it. Everyone was so nice and I really appreciate them accommodating her as she is in a wheelchair. Great job ladies 😊</Review>

<review>I was in the area visiting and decided that I should spend some quality time on myself before heading back home, this place was fantastic with a nice trim and deep condition and blow dry. Hair felt so alive.</review>< user>

Absolutely love this Salon. I've had my hair done in several salons throughout the years. And it's some of the best stylus. From Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. They specialize in color. Because of covid-19 appointments are made at least Two weeks in advance. They are very busy and honor Health mandates. Must wear a mask. All of the hair stylists are wonderful very friendly And caring. They listen to your wants and needs. Looking for touch up or just a  fabulous new you for 2022. This is a go-to. Enjoy and happy hair styling.<//Text>

<review>Shary has done it again! Being new to the area, having daughters, finding a new hair salon is a mission to find. You just don't know what you will get with a new hairdresser.

Shary is absolutely amazing. We made appointments spread out within a few weeks, as trials, and to get to know Shary.  She has exceeded my hopes of having a good haircut.

Shary gives even, symmetrical, polished haircuts. Period. I only highlight my hair twice a year and starting to embrace my grey coming in. Being a (naturally) sun bleached blonde, I'm impatient when it comes to roots and the winter months. Shary knew exactly what to do. It's not over processed, not fake blonde looking, but blended beautifully.

GO SEE SHARY! She knows what she is doing!< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1619277429973, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave us this wonderful review.

Sherri was very sweet, kind, personable, and receptive to my wishes and anxieties. She made sure she closely listened to my ideas and she implemented them beautifully. I could not be happier with her work and I am so relieved my hair looks gorgeous. Very, very well done! Thank you!<//Text>

She fixed my hair, and more importantly, my confidence and ability to face the world. I will be returning. Thanks Diva!</Review>< Gmap_id>

Shari worked magic on my hair. I came in with a mess of 3 or 4 different colors, including a good 3 inches of gray roots, and she fixed it! Not only that, she fixed a botched haircut from a different place. I have found my stylist and I highly recommend you make her yours.<//Text>

Then when they were done charged her 29 bucks and said it was because they styled it. Since when is blow drying hair while cutting it styling. If i could give it less stars i would, i told my wife never to go back there again and look elsewhere...</text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Really outstanding.  I've gotten two last-minute post-work appointments so far with Yuri, and I couldn't be more satisfied, especially for the reasonable price.  I basically asked for "trim, light layers, professional" and she worked her magic. Quick, well done haircut, with sweet staff.

Went in for my appt, had to wait as the stylists had another client which is fine, I get it, running a bit late, fine. She took me in, did what she was supposed to and started the bleach. However, her other client was still there and she would go back and forth between us. Again, I get it, it happens. What was frustrating was that I had to wait for long periods of time with bleach on my hair, which was done in sections with separate wait times, and the other client who was just getting a trim and style at the end did not (it wouldve been different if I was made to wait AFTER all my hair had been finished) as this resulted in very uneven color. She did however, apologize for being busy, though that was my appt slot and I was there for 4 hrs with her other client being there for about half of that. She tried to fix the color but did not seem to know how, in the end she blow dried and I was on my way. Im not really that confrontational so its fine Ill get it fixed eventually but I dont think that should have happened. I paid for a service, did not get the results expected and did not feel like I was made a priority in my own appt.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><user>106465805050532584441< /user><Review>RESPONSE TO THE OWMER:
The receptionist NEVER offered a different stylist and I was only there for a haircut, conditioning treatment and style,which I had let the stylist know ahead of time when I made the appointment NOT FOR TONER. I have Black hair and don't need Toner for it. WRONG CLIENT. Sad to see this happens to other customers as well from the looks of your response. I NEVER was offered another stylist or to reschedule for another appointment. Either you the owner did not properly investigate this incident or You or the Stylists you have working for you are lying to look better for the bad review the stylist has earned this establishment.
FOR ANY FUTURE CUSTOMERS:
I had a bad experience and this buisness tried to lie about my experience, if you have a bad experience here, and leave a review on the experience they will LIE to try to discredit your review and  try to make themselves look better on their reviews. Extremely UNPROFESSIONAL SALON.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:Extremely disappointed with very unprofessional service. I made an appointment and the stylist Natalie reserved my appointment with her at 12pm. I arrived on time and checked into my appointment at 12pm as scheduled and was made to wait an hour, after the hour I still had not recieved any service or even acknowledgement by the stylist who I was waiting on for an hour. I value a stylist's time and respectfully arrived on time for my appointment only for the stylist to disregard respect for her clients time having someone wait an hour on an appointment.</Review>< Time>

<user_name>༺ Phoenix Down ༻< /user_name>< review>
This salon has been the best salon I've ever been to. Heres why:

1.) Workers actually know what they're doing, and they seemed very well trained and experienced.

2.) They ask for a reference picture right away, and put effort into making it look like the picture.

3.) They give warnings and advice about bleached hair.

4.) There products for bleached hair are fairly cheap and work very well.

5.) They don't rush. When you're getting your hair bleached, it must sit for a while before doing the rest of the steps for dying your hair.

I'm positive that there's a lot more reasons why this salon rocks compared to the rest, but by far, in my opinion, this is thr best salon I've been to.< /review>

I went in on a Tuesday to get my hair trimmed and layered. The woman who attended me was very nice but unfortunately my hair did not come out as I asked. The front was a bit longer than the back and it was not layered at all. Sadly I felt as though I was being kicked out of the salon with a wet head of hair. The woman doing my cut seemed to be in a hurry to get me out of her chair. I didn't get a chance to look at my hair properly. I didn't notice that my hair was slightly uneven and not layered until I got home and my hair dried. Sadly it seems as though I have to look for another salon and pay someone else to have my hair evened out properly.</review>

<review>Not really sure how this place has such high reviews, when they can't even GREET a customer that comes through the door.  I went in for a 1pm APPOINTMENT, walked in, waited at the front for over 5 minutes without any acknowledgement. I ended up leaving.  Someone should talk to the owner about running a successful small business. Perhaps this was a blessing in disguise for me - if these "stylists" can't even greet their customers, I'm terrified to find out how good of a haircut they can give.</review>< gmap_id>

They used to host the most amazing brunch on the planet. The interior design is awe inspiring and the kind of beautiful charm you imagine 1920s San Francisco would have been back in the day. My once upon a time city is becoming too gentrified, too renovated, and too expensive, but there are some places worth looking at, and The Palace is one.</review>

Came here for a Saturday afternoon tea for our sister's birthday! Absolutely phenomenal service. I know everyone on Yelp was saying service wasn't great, but we had one of the best experiences ever. Hats off to Aida! Aida was our server and her and Louisa did an amazing job with our service. With vegetarians, vegans, and picky eaters in general, they went above and beyond to ensure the foods were sufficient for each person. Food was delicious! My favorites had to have been the scones with the various creams and jams.

Antonio was also extremely nice and hospitable.

For our birthday girl, they got her a little special cake and gave her this adorable tiara because of the whole palace theme.

Highly highly highly recommend this place for special occasions or for even a fun afternoon! Great for all ages and males and females!

Pro tip: make reservations in advance. 2pm time is better bc less busy, 4pm was packed!</Text>

We're very satisfied with the service for they have accommodating and lovely staff here. The food served was excellent to satisfy our tummy. It was all tasty and satisfying! We're very happy with our stay here. We loved the place!</Text>

The hotel is incredible! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner were all outstanding options. Their lobby is immaculate, and their security system is top-notch. It was also a very wide and well-kept room. Here, we had a wonderful time. They were all pleasant and helpful, putting you at ease and assisting you with your needs. We'll contact you as soon as possible.</text>

< review>
We love staying at the Palace Hotel. It’s part of the Luxury Collection by Marriott, so you cannot go wrong. With most of the rooms being recently updated, you’ll get a modern bathroom with a bidet, and the most comfiest bed! I also love their hair care products. The only drawback are the windows aren’t soundproof (they appear to be older) so you can hear honking and sirens if you’re on the lower levels. Try to request a room on one of the upper levels if possible. The brunch buffet is delicious and there are many options for everyone. Highly recommend. Even if you don’t eat here, have a cocktail during Happy Hour and enjoy the beautifully restored 100-year old glass ceiling. This is where The Game with Michael Douglas was filmed, if you remember that scene of him crashing through the ceiling. Also, make sure you use a parking app to find the lowest-priced parking options because their parking is not cheap.< /review>

Hands down, without a doubt, the Palace Hotel has been the go to for all our client company stays and all of our employees getaways since 1997 when we launched our website.  The rooms are amazing, the staff is incredible and the atmosphere is quite honestly the best in the city. We have a saying around the office, its the Palace Hotel or nothing... The Palace Hotel has one of the most famous champagne brunch is ever ! If you haven't gone to one as soon as the pandemics over you've got to make a reservation. We absolutely love the Palace Hotel< /Text>

<review>This is the best hotel I've been through. All of the staff really made me comfortable by answering all my questions to my full satisfaction. Everything was sparkling clean. There is plenty to do here, but if you don't feel like doing any of it you can enjoy some coffee or wine on your private balcony. Highly recommended!</review>< username>

You cant get a free continental breakfast here (it's $30), but the pool and fitness areas are very nice, and the room was clean with nice towels, 2 good robes, slippers, a fantastic shower head, and free wifi.

Elevators and other common areas require a room key for access, so make sure your key is on you! Bell service was fantastic for me because I checked out in the morning but didnt want to carry my luggage everywhere. They still held my luggage for me. I didn't eat here at all, but they have 3 restaurants that look fantastic.<//Review>< Resp>

This is such a beautiful place, and a mainstay of San Francisco high life. I dined here for a family anniversary, all the whole enjoying the incredible chandeliers and warm sunlight coming in through the glass windows of the building. The architecture is exquisite, and the service is excellent.</text>

We stayed at Palace Hotel for a couple of nights and I just wish we stayed longer because the hotel is beautiful, this hotel is part of The Luxury Collection Hotels from Marriott so go figure! it was build over 100 years ago and the architecture impressive! The rooms are beautifully renovated and so cosy the bed was a 10 out 10! So soft and inviting.

There was a big cafe in the ground floor looking like a royal hall, the staff was extremely friendly at reception, we had help with the bags all the way to our suite and the only thing I wasn’t fully happy with was the view from our window but was a minor thing really, because we spent the whole day visiting the city, we only spend the night time at the hotel.

The corridors are decorated with some vintage furniture and botanical flowers, there is coffee, tea and hot water for free in the mornings. One thing we didn’t expect was the parking spots! They don’t have a parking area, is quite an expensive hotel and so we expected to find parking near buy or included but it was the case, apparently most of the hotels in San Francisco don’t have a parking area.

Overall : 9/10

<text>Wonderful place to stay in downtown SF. The staff were very helpful and courteous, and room service was prompt and delicious. I highly recommend staying here if you are looking for an upclass stay with a traditional feel. The building and rooms are beautiful. The bed was amazingly comfortable. I would love to come back and stay again in the future.</text><UserId.>117775026704660511944</UserId.>< Date>

Beautiful luxurious hotel with wonderful service and staff we enjoyed our stay. Our kids enjoyed the pool, if they could have controlled the temperature outside the pool would have been perfect. The cold feeling out of the water withdraws the crowd into the spa which doesn’t offer enough capacity. We will be back.< /Review>

The event was well staffed and I appreciate that the catering included a majority of healthy, fresh food and snacks instead of just junk food. It was a good venue for the conference and the A/V systems were awesome. The location seems to be in a trendy, walkable part of San Francisco. Some of the decor was too ostentatious for my taste, and I would have liked to have trash cans instead of leaving trash out on trays for the staff to pick up, but overall it was a good experience.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlR3g9c1ulqLooU08WRHw6eqEBNLeDZAgqPknG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7bOT6Lql7aA7MF_Z1AE4BPqaLKQv_610d97fy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuLwwM5wkW4hgMSPKDV6N0I925QeWF7nbgnrRc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Palace Hotel is our favorite hotel in San Francisco. It's a great value and the perfect location to get anywhere in the city. The rooms are beautiful. Bright bathrooms, big showers and comfortable beds. When you see the lobby, restaurant and ballrooms, you'll agree it is a Palace.< /Review>

This is one of the best (and many) Marriott properties I've been to. Very elegant hotel, great location, excellent service, neat room, wonderful gym and spa, access to the Ghiradelli store from within. I really enjoyed the week.
Unfortunately, I didnt get a chance to try the breakfast. Went to the Pied Piper bar downstairs, which was also quite nice. The only area of improvement is that at Pied Piper, service could have been a little better.</Review>

<Review>Central location, amazing lobby, decent rooms. Unfortunately for everything applies additional fees, even for internet... Spa area small and could be more pleasing(we did not dare to go to jacuzzi where other guests were having there foot refreshing /dipped in). Street close to the hotel full of homeless people who are physically threatening and aggressive. In the end, good for short city escape, but not relaxing long stay.<//Review>< Pictures>

I don’t remember much other than the gentleman at the front desk was from Boston and that his opulent customer service was truly radiating. I received the absolute highest quality of service. It was like I was the only person there. I will be staying here on my next trip to San Francisco just to see the opera and to relax the Palace. I will fly to San Francisco just to stay here. It really is that great of an experience.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The decor was beautiful. The lobby was gorgeous- and the hallways to the rooms were bright and well lit (and a little reminiscent of the original Shining movie 😎)- it was not what I considered true luxury because once we entered our 'upgraded' room we found our cabinet doors were wonky and would not close without some manipulation, the bathroom sink slow drained (no pic because I can't get the video to post) and the interior of the ice room was dirty. The Buffet was too cold - cold, runny Eggs Benedict and half cold greasy bacon and sausage - no, no, no! Plus the wait staff all seemed to have attitude. The one saving grace was the cleaning crew. They were smiling all day every day - and willing to do whatever you asked of them.<//text>

An elegant majestic building with modern  clean design looks. Located in downtown SF outside Montgomery station, provides excellent service. Breakfast or Lunch in Garden Court offers great food and ambiance; For dinner best try other restaurant around the area as they only have 1 restaurant/bar with limit options.</Text>

Luxuriously looking hotel with impeccable services and the rooms I’m in is great. Had good rest and hospitality from Palace Hotel. We wanted to try the High Tea but missed it as it was not available on Sunday. Would definitely recommend and revisit!</review>

I'm here for a conference and it's such a beautiful hotel. Great mid corridor with marble floors, high arches and museum pieces of the hotel along the corridor. Be sure to stop at the Garden Court, you can't miss out on this spectacular establishment.<//text>

Very comfy, high ceiling room for two but with only a smallish bath. We had a nice view of the city skyline with the Salesforce tower. Architecturally the hotel is noted for its turn of the century glass and ironwork domed atrium.  Breakfast was served there and it was extra good giving us time to enjoy the space. The one surprise we had was the $87 local room tax for a one night stay!!< /Text>

<review>Beautiful hotel. Stayed here on business. Knowledgable staff. If you have an appreciation for architecture, you will love it. Rooms are on the small side, but the building is old, so that's to be expected. Rooms are very modern.</review>< pics>

I loved everything, absolutely everything about this hotel.

The have the most beautiful amenities🤗 the indoor pool. The restaurant is clean and they have breakfast buffet. Love it! I have attached some photos of the hotel.
The valet staff is wonderful.

Thank you Palace Hotel for making my stay/bday weekend amazing. Will be coming back here for sure.< /review>

Classy place, an architectural masterpiece and a national landmark. The grand hall is a must see. DeLuxe king rooms are big and airy - high ceiling.
Unfortunately the wifi sucks</Review>

We thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel. Everything was perfect! We dined in the restaurant at the hotel, and it was delicious, and the service was excellent. We played golf, went shopping downtown, rode the trolley, and just enjoyed sightseeing on this beautiful island.

<time>1541339208057</time><rate>4</rate><Review>Stayed here for a business meeting in the Financial District. I was hesitant to book here because I normally prefer new hotels, but the renovated room I got was quite nice: it retained the historical feel but with updated facilities, including convenient electrical outlets at the desk and near the bed. The room had high ceilings, but the bathroom was indeed small, particularly very little counter space. The sink also did not drain well. There were loud protests outside - day and night - from a labor dispute that had been ongoing for most of October, involving 80% of the hotel's employees! Fortunately I was given a room away from the street, but it did affect the ability to go in and out from the front - or sometimes even the side doors.< /Review>< Pics>

This is a beautiful hotel with outstanding service. All my requests were accommodated before and throughout my stay. The room was clean, spacious and had great views (on Market st).

Fantastic property. Great historical value. I loved the vibe. The entrance and lobby area cannot be matched in San Francisco. While the area is currently not the greatest (lots of homeless around which for international travelers might come as a shock), amazing restaurants and sites were walking distance. The concierge and staff helped in every way possible.</Text>

<text>We have always enjoyed the interaction between the Palace staff and my wife and I. This time Bellman Ronald (last name escapes us) was there and saw us to our room. He was very informative regarding new places to eat and see. During our three day stay we saw Ronald on and off, visiting with him. It was this kind of hospitality that made us feel we were home. So hats off to Ronald and the other staff that made our stay so memorable.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><date>1582156800000<//date>< GmapID>

I thought that the hotel is not that very nice because the pricing is cheaper than the other hotels, but when I stayed here for three nights, I saw that the space is spotless and the atmosphere is very welcoming. The staff that accommodated us was Kim who is very kind and lovely. They have excellent service. It was like a luxury hotel! Thus, I am proud to recommend this to everyone.< /Text>

<username>peter kirk< /username><Text>Very cool, old style hotel.  High ceiling rooms, very comfy beds.  And a bidet built into the toilet! Great breakfast buffet. Parking at the garage across the street is pricey, and the hotel had no parking garage of its own. The windows in the rooms are very old. And likely are not double or triple paned,  as the sounds of the street and trucks late seemed quite loud at night (which may keep you awake). But a good hotel.  Book enough in advance,  and you might get up to 50% off of the room rate.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rate>4<//rate><Time>1579061627001</Time>< response>

This historic hotel oozes of history, opulence, and class. It's maintained as it was in it's yester glory days with modern fittings and amenities in the rooms. The entrance area and the Grand Court are spectacular to look at and the Christmas decorations (as we were there during Christmas) were amazing as well.

What really stands apart is the customer service - from the front staff, to the housekeeping, the Bell staff, and to the staff at the Pied Piper and restaurants - everyone came together in providing just amazing service. This is what really added to the old world charm of this hotel and made our stay wonderful.

Great location - right next to Bart (Montgomery), and centrally located in San Fran. The rooms were not huge but decent sized for our needs. Bathrooms were large enough with bidets built in.
Food was very good everywhere from the restaurants to room service.
Having an evening drink at the Pied Piper was a classic experience with the ambiance that never goes out of style. Having a Ghirardelli onsite is an added bonus.</text>

Simply a wonderful experience, even if it was brief. Given the change I would definitely return. The service from start to finish was excellent. Check-in was quick and friendly. Got to a comfortable and luxurious room, even if it was one of the more basic ones. Bathroom wasn't large but it was well equipped. The water pressure was good for such an old building. On my trip, this was the only hotel I truly got a good night's rest in.
They even have an evening turn down service. Even included a little chocolate. Who gives out chocolates anymore? They were also always loading me up on water bottles, more water bottles. While nice, I would hope to see bottle fillers replace so many of the plastic bottles.
I also stayed for a Saturday breakfast buffet which was very well loaded with a variety of options. A good number of items from local shops. Great to see them supporting local businesses.
All in all it was a wonderful stay and I hope to return. With cars no longer on that portion of market Street it's much quieter and a great location.</Text>

Beautiful hotel.  Rooms are very well done but there is not a dresser.  So if you have difficulty bending keep it in the suitcase.  And there is no coffee in the rooms.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Immaculate, historic hotel with a beautiful lobby.  The rooms were spacious, had great details and we're well appointed. I loved the Grand feeling even when walking in the hallways which in newer hotels have low ceilings and tight dark corridors this was quite the opposite. Staff was wonderful and from the valet, to bell desk I was impressed with the service. Jon V at the front desk was especially personal and kind and made or stay extra special by sending up a bottle of champagne.</Text>< pics>

How about and insanely gaudy crystal and gold laden room? Then let me tell you about Saturday afternoon tea at the Palace Hotel...first they sit you down and arrive with a plate of four fruits, not whole fruits, but four bites of fresh fruit and get your tea order. Second, you're presented with four slivers of sandwiches ( sprouts on one, smoked salmon on another, turkey on a third and squash on the fourth) which were flavorful, but did they ever leave me hungry. Third, the desserts, which again were flavorful, but it looks like they could feed a small bird, not a 6'4" humanoid... it's a good thing Wendy's was open. I don't understand the afternoon tea thing, but the food was good so I was glad to partake.< /Text>< user_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Palace Hotel is an indulgence in every single way. I feel pampered in their well appointed rooms that are gorgeous. The linens and pillows are so comfortable and tasteful. They use Byredo products that smell delicious.  Their breakfast is divine in the stunning gilded Garden Court— and free if you are a member in one of their rewards programs. Don’t miss the gym and the best swimming pool in SFO!  It’s heated, indoors, under used (so you can have it all to yourself) and sunshine filled because of the glass enclosure. I also love how their renovation didn’t take away from their history and elegance, and only enhanced it.<//text>< Pics>

It really does conjure images of old San Francisco in it's heyday of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<//Text>< user>

Historic hotel with grand halls and opulent fixtures and a location that’s central to everything. Highly recommend stopping here in between shopping (Union Square is just a few blocks away) for tea and enjoying the historic building and peace from the busy city.< /Review>

Very luxurious hotel. The service was excellent all-around.  A little pricy but we found that most things in SF were that way. We had a Deluxe room with a "courtyard" view. Our windows faced the inner part of the hotel, overlooking a lower roof.</review>

< Review>
Our stay at the Palace Hotel was exceptional and this is truly a Luxury Hotel.  The staff at the Palace are top notch and go our of their way to make sure that you enjoy your stay and want to come back.  Malia at the concierge desk and Scott at the front desk showed nothing but the best hospitality that you could ever ask for.  We were celebrating our 35th Anniversary and helped make it the best.  We have already recommended the Palace  our friends as being a true 5 star and having 5 star staff as well.  Keep up the great work!  Thank you making our day very memorable. We can't wait to return!<//Review>

<text>I absolutely love the Palace Hotel which is one of the most beautiful in the world. Old world elegance meets modern convenience.  I wanted to sit in the lobby for ours just to admire the architecture and art. I felt like I was in Paris. Rooms had upgraded, modern bathrooms which blended with the historical elements of the hotel without clashing. The only thing that needed modern change was the menu which was not vegan-friendly. Otherwise, we would have spent even more time in the hotel.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Even though the hotel was bustling with guests and throwing a party- the rooms provided tranquil respite and noise was not bad at all. We faced Market St on 7th floor and it was quite quiet. In room service for food and drink were accurate in their time quotes and drinks were well worth the price. Room service breakfast was delicious- but seemed it would have been even better if it arrived hot instead of just like warm- that being said it WAS NYE, so maybe just a lot going on. The beds and linens and toilet are divine! The grey lavender paint with minimalist classic molding won me over as I watched dawn come over the city. All in all- it felt like luxury! Would definitely stay again but maybe ask for a room with sunlight.< /Text>

The Palace Hotel is beautifully restored and maintained.  The staff were very warm and helpful.  Our room was spacious but there was very little storage, no drawers or cabinets.  The bathroom was smallish but there was plenty of room for toiletries. My only complaint was that it was a little dark, and the water pressure was light. It was a rain shower with light pressure, so difficult to get a good rinse off. Also, the half shower door  tended to flood the room. 
Overall a wonderful stay though.</Review>

Not a single complaint. The hotel is beautiful, it feels like stepping back in time in absolute luxury. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff  always seems to anticipate your needs. All of the dining options are wonderful. With confidence, I highly recommend this travel destination.</Text>

< Review>
Once the famous Sheraton Palace Hotel now, simply  the Palace Hotel...is still Breathtaking. Last weekend, we had a small gathering and enjoyed High Tea in the main lobby level area.
First,  our friendly waitress Delivered for pots of tea. Each different -most of us were looking for decaf. Note: The teapots weigh a ton! They are filled to the brim and very difficult to pour.
I have no idea what the per person-cost was for the high tea, but I would think that the waitress might serve some of the tea.
Everyone received four delicious, little, tea sandwiches. More tea was delivered.Tried to wave the waitress down to get a new napkin but she was busy chatting. Her assistant seemed distracted.
Desserts were tiny ...and delicious.
Very popular.<//Review>

The Palace Hotel is very beautiful and decorated in a classic period style. However the rooms are quite small. Our room’s door opened right into the room, no entry hallway. We had a minor upgrade to a room that had a view of Market Street. That also included the noise of Market Street. Thankfully we aren’t super light sleepers. 

The bathroom was also very small. The toilet had a bidet seat which was nice but the shower didn’t look very thoroughly cleaned as the tile had some staining. It was also very small. 

The pool area (which The Palace is the only Marriott in the downtown area with a pool) Is beautiful with the windowed ceiling! The pool was a little chilly for our liking. We did use the hot tub but it was kind of small. There were 4 people in it and anymore would have been a little cramped. 

We were provided with an umbrella one day which was very helpful.   

Location wise it was very close to Chinatown and the shopping on Market Street. It sits in the financial district so I am sure this hotel is great for business travelers. The BART Montgomery Station drops you off right in front of the side doors into the hotel which was great.<//Text>

We had seven rooms booked at The Palace Hotel to celebrate my dad's 80th birthday.  From the moment we checked in with Jelly at the front desk to the moment we left with hugs from the valet, our stay could not have been made more special!  Great staff, perfect location, and again GREAT STAFF - the woman who served us drinks in the lobby (she was from China, I wish I remembered her name) she made us all feel so at home.  I will be back.  Thank you!!!< /review>

This is supposed to be the most top end luxury hotel. It looks glamorous when you walk in and the main hall is beautiful but the hotel itself was a bit disappointing. The room was quite dark and dingy and a bit run down. The wardrobe doors wouldn't stay shut. The bathroom hadn't been cleaned properly there were shaving hairs on the shelf and glasses. There was two free water bottles in the room. Reception were helpful, they got the bathroom sorted out and gave us one free morning breakfast. Shame that was a bit disappointing too. The staff looked overstretched and weren't exactly friendly or helpful. You get offered coffee and orange juice but not tea. Had to find someone to help me get a pot of tea as they rushed off before I could ask. Reasonable buffet with lots of choice but you can buy a better breakfast outside the hotel. Overall we didn't think the hotel was worth the money. The location is OK but not the easiest if you arrive in San Francisco for the first time. Fisherman's wharf or Union Square are easier. Buy a city pass for use on all public transport and big savings on entry to attractions.</review>

<review>Would give 10 stars if possible! From the moment we checked in we could tell the Palace was a cut above most of the other high end properties we’ve stayed at! They even went so far as to send a beautiful piece of cake and a bottle of wine compliments of the hotel to our room for my birthday! Beautiful touch on top of a perfect stay!

Only negative I saw was the size of the jacuzzi in the pool area. It was pretty small and busy at most times we visited, but if that’s the worst thing about this hotel I can’t really complain!

Amazing stay, can’t wait to stay again, and would recommend anyone and everyone to stay here!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Overall great visit. Our one issue is that the line for check-in, etc could be more clearly defined, or the front desk employees should let visitors know that they need to wait in line if there are other guests waiting for service. Other than that, the hotel is beautiful, everything is spacious and the location is decent but being downtown, you are approached quite a bit by homeless.< /Text>

You're right around the corner from a Walgreens and a Starbucks. pool and hot tub and workout facilities are really good. The curious thing is there is no coffee in the room. That's usually not a bad thing and a Marriott because they're in room coffee services some of the nastiest coffee on the planet, but in this hotel if you want to have coffee in your room they will bring a Keurig machine to your room. So bring your own keurig cups.
Parking is limited down here so think twice about renting a car. You can Uber everywhere and you're within a mile walking distance of most of the major attractions and the downtown area.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOkQf2ajsNWdAcM-L2KkSsrqwv2RtIOy_5DTbX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtiWCRLoqs6pFq72OsFx6H1d4bHHkgXRk5DOh0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjwP2vcm-_f0KgSoGOoNX2wfAXiG52vpXv2mT2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMb__6R5XaXiuXBcsfVD3IuuPQ0BeQ4iXyW6Eol=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3us1K0GIsYNwVBEuqIxgXyZ7d-U-3tZ3HwVM9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNp1beD1xSl_NfMAmMExtidAJvfJt5qDAG47XXN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoUSXQtWNVI5indukRcEBgCRVzNx_GATGRIWHH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Beautiful hotel, great location, close to all public transportation, MUNI & BART just outside, with cable cars just a short block away. Our room was clean and the hotel has an overall grand feeling about it. Lots to do nearby, restaurants, movie theater, civic center, nightlife and museums. Can't stress the location enough, we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to enjoy San Francisco. No hidden resort fees or nightly imposed fees, I personally don't stay at any hotel that has those. Overall a 10 out of 10.</Text>

The Palace Hotel is an all round great hotel with friendly staff in the heart of San Francisco. The most appealing part of the hotel is the beautiful lounge area that can be seen on the second picture on my post.  This lounge area has been well-maintained since the hotel originally opened and is a fantastic spot to grab a coffee or a quick snack. The hotel also has a pretty fantastic bar called Pied Piper which, is definitely worth a visit. The hotel rooms themselves are fairly nice with high ceilings and the bed I had was comfortable enough (6 out of 10).  All in all, this hotel is worth a stay if you prioritize location and a historic setting and it is definitely a better value than other comparably priced hotels in the area.</text>

Aesthetics are nice. Rooms are on the smaller side, even for SF standards. Calling the service line can sometimes take upwards of a minute or two to get someone on the line to answer your question/order food. For the price point would expect a bit more - will be prioritizing staying at other properties before this one in SF< /text>

Beautiful property well maintained.  Problem with room design and  furnishings.  OK if you are spending one night..  The decor does not match the architecture building nor the public spaces.

F&B.  Did not like the curt hostess in the Garden Court. rut to us and we dined else where.  Hat tea but table service with no linen and the flavor of a tea,, It was lacking. the room is loud and  there are some things that  could be done to  make if up.  I wold rather have tea in the front of the restaurant on the couch.</review>

First, this is a beautiful hotel. I had a corner suite on the 4th floor. There were several fails, starting from the first day. The bathroom had several long hairs on the floor, which I asked housekeeping to clean up, which they did. The next morning, I saw more long hairs in the shower, which I simply washed down the drain. In 5 days, the minibar was refreshed exactly once. Housekeeping also left an icebucket of melted ice one day, rather than emptying it. The phones' speed dial for service did not work, leading me to call the hotel as an outside number to be transferred to someone who could help. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and awkwardly arranged. I rearranged the furniture for my stay to make the room functional. No one offered help with my luggage upon arrival, nor offered to show me to my room and show me the amenities. The internet can be intermittant at times, shocking, given that you're in SF.< /Review>

The hotel is really beautiful and makes you want to take pictures of everything in terms of architecture - one small issue is that the room I got had no clothing storage space I.e. no drawers, no placard. This means it’s inconvenient for some.</Review>

<Rating>None<//Rating><Review>This hotel is certainly palatial. It’s very easy to be taken aback by the shear grandeur of the spaces. 

It was Thanksgiving weekend, so the hotel was nearly at capacity and it showed. It was a bit overwhelming to experience hordes of crowds with check-in & breakfast lines a mile long. The hotel felt understaffed. Once reaching a staff member is reached, they’re very polite and helpful. 

I really enjoyed the Byredo bath amenities, but the suite that I was checked-into had a half-drunk soda bottle still in the room. Luggage took several hours and multiple phone calls. 

The hotel was renovated in 2015, but the interior designer chose to go a more modern direction with the furniture, which is a bit of a shame. 

Overall, it was a nice experience and I’d stay at the Palace again.</Review>< Pics>

<text>How incredible is it to stay in the oldest hotel in San Fran.  This hotel is absolutely wonderful and I look forward to returning.  We stayed in the Palace 1 bedroom suite on the 8th floor.  I paid a small fortune for the room but have not regrets and look forward to returning!  My wife and I were so in love with the hotel, we ended up buying a book in the lobby that went over the history of the Hotel.  I'm halfway through the book and love the history which will add to my experience for any future stay.  I highly recommend this hotel and the epic 1 bedroom suite we stayed in.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This staff was the most helpful and friendliest I have ever encountered. I traveled for a work convention, but my family came with me. My son was turning 9 during the trip and they made his birthday extra special. The rooms were very nice and the food was as well. I consider myself to travel a good bit, and this is by far the best hotel experience I have ever had.<//review>

Highly recommending this hotel to anyone who wants to experience SF at its best. The service was top notch with great details and the front office can actually pronounce my Asian name. Are there cheaper hotels? Yes, but it’s like saying that there are cheaper cars than Mercedes Benz.</Review>

The food was very very good. I came here for an Oracle sponsored buffet for dinner and every bit of the food was incredible.
Especially the desserts!
I don't think I've ever had a better Macaroon. Hardiah shell and super soft inside. Great GREAT flavor!
The cheese were delightfully flavorful, soft and mmmm</text>

The mayor of San Francisco cancelled the ballet performance that we planned to attend this weekend, which was a real disappointment.  But we already had a suite upgrade at the Palace and we decided to come anyway and enjoy the luxury of the Palace, experience the suite, swim in the pool, and have a little get away.  As always, a stay at the Palace is a wonderful treat, and we thoroughly enjoyed our get away.< /review>

<user_name>Marriottmember< /user_name><userid>None</userid><review>I had an upset stomach  soI called  customer service to see if the was a place I could go buy a ginger ale to soothe myself. Room service said they will rush one up. And the did. It was perfect. But I had one complaint. The bottle of Ginger ale was $21.00. If you make the prices closer to the competitor right out the front lobby, your guess will order room service mor instead of going out. We are savvy shoppers. Next Time I will know to buy before entering, or I will get dress and leave to purchase and then come back. That is lost revenue for the Palace.</review>< Rating>

<Text>Absolutely loved the history behind the building, and what has been done to preserve the facade and update the interiors. Had the opportunity to dine at the Garden Court and The Pied Piper too, which made my experience all the more complete. The room was a little small, but thankfully space was well utilised. Importantly, the staff made my stay very enjoyable for all 6 nights!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Stayed for 4 nights. Everyone from the doorman to the people that cleaned the rooms were extremely friendly and helpful. They always greet you with a smile. Room was clean and spacious. Beds were made in heaven. Gym was well maintained. Location was suberb. You can get anywhere using public transportation that stopped in front of the hotel. Amazon go store is 2 blocks away. Definitively staying here again when I return to SF.<//text>< Pictures>

Amazing place. Definitely worth it. Very convenient location. They treat you like a king. Night room setting with blackout shades and chocolates. The bathroom is amazing. Do not believe the haters, it is amazing. The gym and pool are right next to each other on the 4th floor, you can ask for a room close to them. WiFi is complementary if you join their rewards club, which I did and got this perk. The bar and food look great. The bedding was amazingly comfortable. No complaints. Use the pool, it is phenomenal with window roof to get an outside view. Lots more to say. Best value around the area.  Highly recommended.<//Text>

This hotel is over 100 years old, but updated with nice amenities. Everything that makes it special for being an antique location has been preserved. Everything you’d like updated, such as the bathrooms, appears brand new. The staff treated us like kind friends. We had a great time.</Text>

However, after we were able to go to our suite the rest of the stay was exceptional.  The service, food, comfort, quietness, spaciousness, and quality of the suite was way above our expectation.  We have been in suites before but this was very nice.  We have never had a problem with the food which is fantastic even for the breakfast.  One must go to their Brunch and always make reservations even if it is for breakfast.  We did dine in one night and the Filet Mignon with vegetables was really good and made to our expectations.  The upgrade was definitely worth it because the suite is 3 comfortable, spacious rooms and great if one has a guest to meet.  The location is perfect, you can take Bart directly to the hotel, it is close by to restaurants, the movie theater, and places to eat out as well.  Within walking distance from Chinatown and the cable car.  We will be coming back again.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

Work and family bring us back to San Francisco frequently, and the Palace Hotel has quickly become a home away from home. From the building to the staff, everything about the Palace is a welcome reprieve from the hussle of the city outside. 

Don't pass up breakfast. The morning spread in the Garden Court far exceeds expectations for the usual Bonvoy offering.</text>

<Text>Overall, this property does not come close to other Luxury collections I have stayed.  The rooms are decidedly average (but quite clean) and the service was polite (not friendly or even overly efficient for that matter).  The location is excellent though close to a MUNI and BART station.  Had issues with the room, including technical problems with the safe that was only resolved after two days and having to bring it to the attention of the manager.  Have honestly received better friendlier service at properties with fewer stars.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Fancy hotel with very clean rooms - as expected of a hotel in its price range. My only wish is the rooms to be a little bigger, but it's a very minor complaint.  The central air worked well and was quiet.  The toilets are elongated with an integrated bidet.  The interior fit and finish was good as well.  The staff is very helpful and provided us a lot of local recommendations to do near the hotel.  I did not try the restaurant but I was told it gets very busy especially for breakfast with a 30-45 minute wait on the weekends.  Would stay again at this hotel.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>It is deserving of being part of the luxury collection association.
The valets picking up the vehicle are nice and helpful.
Although I didn't use the bell service, they were right one standby.
The reception desk is a bit small but that doesnt detract from the service they provide.
The inside lounge/lobby area is beautiful.
The hallways of the interior are a bit plain and generic, a little freaky after watching IT 2.
The rooms are fantastic, very clean and modernized.
Bed was nice and firm, clean sheets, fluffy pillows. But they make a good bit of noise during activities.
Walls in between seem to hold sound well, I don't know if other guests could hear us but we couldn't hear them from inside the room. The Bathroom is very nice, comes with a bidet and a shower head that towers over my head and I'm 72 inches tall.
The room service and amenities were spot on.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
If you want to stay at a hotel that feels like you are back in the early 1900’s with beautiful chandeliers and glass throughout, a gorgeous tea room, a spectacular pool and restaurant this is the place for you. The rooms still have  that terrific charm but are totally updated and the staff are genuinely friendly and very helpful. When you enter this hotel for the first time you can’t help but say “wow “.<//Review>

<review>Amazing Hotel especially if you love historic buildings.  Very modern amenities mixed with a classic hotel style you don't see any more.  Location is great for food shopping and only a 20 minute walk to the Piers.  Rooms are exactly how they appear on the website and very classic and upscale architecture/features.  Our experience with the staff was amazing. Everyone was very helpful, courteous and prompt.  San Francisco is a very "unique" place and if ever go back, The Palace would be my first choice.  Beware if you drive.....you could check you car into a Motel 6 for cheaper than it cost to park there.<//review>< Response>

This hotel has old charm and modernized convenience. So close to all the attractions but very quiet. Staffs are friendly and willing to help you. Just this time we didn't get the connecting rooms that we asked. Instead we got 2 rooms with an electric room in the middle even though the hotel didn't look very full. One of the guests heard the noise from the room and had to use ear plug. And one of the water bottle in the room seemed opened already. We had water that we bought before so it wasn't big deal to us. Other than these, it was good enough for a weekend getaway trip for us.<//review>

A really nice hotel. +I love how there’s an indoor pool, because in San Francisco it gets really chilly. +I like how there’s a gym. +The rooms look very modern and it looks BOOTIFUL! +The feel of the touches of the 90’s make this hotel come alive. -The food service food is average, it’s not mouth watering. -I don’t understand the half door for the shower, but that was annoying when I was taking showers, because water dropped out of the crease of the door.    Other than that, my stay at the Palace Hotel was great!!!< /review>

Overall its a nice historic hotel with a very beautiful lobby. They seem to be significantly understaffed which lead to issues at check-in and the valet. Upon arrival at 4pm our room was not ready and 1 1/2 hours later we were still waiting. We finally received a room but it was not the upgraded room we booked online. The room itself is small, which is not unexpected in a historic property but it didnt have basic amenities either, such as power at the desk or a mirror in the room which made it challenging for two people to get ready at the same time. The hotel room was clean and the bed was comfortable however.< /review>

Hotel common areas, staff service, location and restaurants are all spectacular.  Came here for 25th anniv. and it was wonderful.  The rooms because older hotel can only be updated so much.  Small bathrooms and average size rooms.  It was still very comfortable.  The parking is outrageous at $72 per day.  I would have given a 4.5 but wasnt an option. I’ll be back though!!<//Text>

Beautiful hotel. Stayed here on business. Knowledgeable staff. If you have an appreciation for architecture, you will love it. Rooms are on the small side, but the building is old, so that's to be expected. Rooms are very modern.<//review></record></dataset><record>

This hotel is downtown San Fran and close to Union Square, restaurants and shopping. The inside is gorgeous and well maintained. Rooms are spacious and have great amenities. Everyone was so accommodating and friendly. Will definitely stay again on my next visit to SFO.< /review>

I was satisfied with the room, cleanliness, possibility to check in early, the impressive interiors of the lobby etc. 
I was not impressed by the lack of proper info at check in on change of internet password during the stay and the fact that the lobby entrance would be blocked out for guests (!) completely on the night of our arrival. There are guests who do not speak English and explanations by a doorman later on were confusing and unnecessary (entering through a mase of a bar etc), as it was literally 10m to reach the lifts from the entrance so it could be fenced for guests to make life easy. Unfortunately it spoilt the impression of being welcomed as a guest in the hotel or being some kind of a priority for the hotel mamagement. Which in my opinion is one the top objectives for a hotel of this class (if not for any hotel).</review>

Beautiful hotel.  Fridge made odd noises, but otherwise the room was nice, staff very good.  Expedia listed my reservation under my middle name which confused my check in.  The staff were very good - figured it out and gave us a hotel credit at the restaurant.  Very nice as it was an expedia issue.</text>

The best part of the stay was the buffet breakfast - probably the best hotel breakfast outside of the luxury hotels in Vegas. The lobby spaces are magnificent and the pool quite fine. But I've stayed here twice this year - once in a terrific room, this time in a mediocre one. The desk chair had to be moved to open the door. And maintenance? Internet did not work properly on check-in. Tivoli clock radio not operative because display was not working. Outlets on desk awkward.  But the real shock came with two dinners at Pied Piper. Nearly inedible apart from the salads and beer.  This could be a great hotel. And it nearly seemed so the first time I stayed. But this time....<//review>

We had a late check in upon settling in the room we noticed toilet was partially clogged and flushing very slowly. We called to have it repaired. Two calls an an hour later a maintenance man showed up with a plunger and attempted to unclog the toilet... he failed and said they have to come in the morning with a toilet auger. At this point our two kids were fast asleep and the toilet was at least kinda of flushing. By morning the toilet was completely clogged and non functioning. Went down to front desk to complain and was told “so sorry please go up and pack and we’ll move you to and room ASAP”.  It took three more trips to the counter and talk with the duty manager to finally get a new room FOUR hours after my first complaint..FOUR hours... that’s ASAP.</text>

Very nice hotel located in the middle of the city. Perfect hidden spot to get coffee or use Internet. Prices are super high but if you're just getting something small it won't hurt too much. Bring your own WiFi.< /Review>

<Review>Celebrated my girlfriend’s 35th Birthday for 4 wonderful nights at the Palace Hotel. Everyone from the Front Desk staff was absolutely helpful, Malia, Scott, Blaine, made sure there was a nice little surprise birthday cake dessert at our suite the exact day of her birthday. Catherine at in room dining services was also very sweet!  The people at concierge desk where extremely friendly and very helpful, Joe, Raymond and Kevin. And our house keeping lady Alma always kept our room spotless, she was fantastic! Overall, The Palace hotel was a gorgeous accommodation and the location was perfectly near to everything but I have to say that their staff went beyond our expectations and made our stay memorable.</Review></record>

The Palace is a beautiful hotel with an incredible lobby/Atrium.  Classic, elegant, and service oriented.  The people are
terrific, and guest focused.  Convenient location as well.  In-room dining food was outstanding.  Definitely recommend this hotel for your stay.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Date>1573960631412<//Date><text>My daughter and I took our annual quick getaway to San Francisco this past year. I get a companion pass every year on Delta so we chose SFO. I booked the Palace through American Express' Fine Hotels & Resorts program because it offered a guaranteed 4pm checkout and a $100 amenity credit - among other benefits.

We left (from Vegas) after I got off work but because of a connection in L.A., we didn't have in San Francisco until almost 10pm. By the time we got to the hotel, it was almost 11. The reason I bring this up is because we were planning on having dinner at the Pied Piper. The posted hours show it being open until midnight daily - and it was - but they don't serve their dinner menu until midnight.

We were disappointed but ordered room service and it was pretty awesome. But getting back to the hotel - it's beautiful and oozes history. The Garden Court is absolutely stunning..... it's palatial (get it, palatial and we're starting at the Palace). The rooms are large and elegant as well. Our room didn't have a view but because of the hotel's location, I'm sure some rooms have amazing views.

We also didn't have time to eat the provided breakfast because we left early to hit the sights so can't comment on it. We made the usual rounds since it was my daughter's first time in San Francisco and this is where the 4pm checkout is super helpful. We were able to spend the entire day in the city, get back to the room and shower, and still get to the airport comfortably.

I loved everything about our stay but hope to stay longer next time, eat at the Pied Piper, and have breakfast in the Garden Court. We both enjoyed our experience at the Palace Hotel!< /text>< response>

During check-in, there was a heavy line up with only two staff in the front attending customers and the wait was roughly 20 minutes long. If there was more staff during the check-in process, it would have made the whole experience for folks traveling far a lot smoother.  Upon arrival, I was told a room was not ready for an early check-in. I notified them I was an elite Gold Bonvoy member and requested an early check-in. However, the Montgomery room I booked was not ready; and I had to settle for a downgrade for the only room available as my wife was tired and pregnant and didn't want to wait for the room. So not only did we have to wait a long time to get served, but we also didn't get the room we expected, and wasn't able to get an early check in. I was told by the original desk attendant that I would be contact in an hour with an update on a room, but didn't hear anything and had to go back an hour later to ask if anything was available as well. The service was extremely poor and I was highly disappointed.

I typically don't leave negative reviews as I come to San Francisco every month for work and try all the Bonvoy Establishments to get a different experience and most if not all except for this one was fair and I was always left satisfied with the whole experience and service. 

Unfortunately, this experience did not live up to my expectations, and I've already booked another hotel for next month for my stay in San Francisco.</Review>

<Review>Beautiful hotel. Great restaurant even for a burger and glass of red wine. It's great to come here for small meetings or just to hang out and admire the building. It isn't too loud and doesn't feel crowded even when busy. It is right in downtown San Francisco in a great spot for shopping and exploring.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrMDBKshKeyf36kg0EgB2adUM_ypVBZ9Fr1dnw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Honestly, this was a great hotel.  Everything was clean and in working order.  The palace hotel exceeded my expectations and I would return again.

Probably the most important part of taking a vacation is where you lay your head to sleep and where you wake up.  If you’re not enjoying this part of your vacation, is it really a vacation?</text>

Absolutely beautiful hotel! Full of history, and modernized perfectly to maintain the original touch. Absolute best house keeping ever (Betty was great!). The bathroom in our room was superb. The entire room was a great surprise, from the fridge to the beds that you could just melt into. Breakfast buffet was consistently above expectations.there were a couple downsides though. The internet was expensive, and you had to pay to use the business center. Overall,  would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone< /review>

The Palace Hotel is incredible, both in its nostalgia in preserving its long history and past, but with luxurious and modern rooms.  Service was excellent!  This will be my SF go to hotel in the future.  The Garden restaurant is a must see in terms of its architecture.  I almost felt like I was in Italy when relaxing and dining there.  After having stayed at some of the best hotels in the world, this one is up there at that level!<//Text>

The Palace Hotel used to be a destination, especially during holiday time. The grand holiday tree in the garden court was a sight to see. The decorations throughout the hotel were one of a kind and all spectacular. Today? Meh. The tree is a grouping of three small trees which are dwarfed by the room's size. Also, ugly beyond measure. The hotel is devoid of additional decorations and looks pretty darn sad. The Garden Court redo looks like it is set up like a train station but without the vintage look - just crowded with tables and during our stay which is usually a busy time, empty. Be aware that if you have a profile, no one might read it in advance to prepare your room accordingly. Also be prepared for little communication about hotel events that preclude your ability to either eat/drink at the bar or Garden Court because someone thought it a good idea to allow them to close both at the same time for private events leaving guests to either order room service or find somewhere else to eat at the last minute. It was so disappointing I'd never book the Palace again. What it once was, is gone. I really hope someone listens and brings back the awesomeness that made the Palace a destination. All it needs is someone to care. Also, it could use some help with allowing the staff to be more upbeat and accommodating. It's like their hands are tied by management. No one was unfriendly, but they sure weren't helpful. Big difference.</review>

<review>Apparently we got a deal on the price! It is supposed to be a heritage luxury hotel. No coffee tea in room. No breakfast included for a 300$ room. Go to first floor to get hot water during restricted times. The lounge is Beautiful and the only USP of the hotel. And was  Not open to paying customers when we were there. They were making money on Christmas brunch I guess by locking other paying guests out!!! Pool is nothing to write home about. The water reeked of chlorine. Basically nice clean room, with NO amenities close to a 5 star hotel. I guess this was our experience because we were there on Christmas eve? But we could have done better for the 300$ a room we spent for that day.</review>< pictures>

This was my first visit to The Palace Hotel, and it exceeded expectations! The hotel common and dining spaces are beautiful (Garden Court and Pied Piper especially), and our room was lovely (not huge, but more than fair considering the hotel's central location). The front desk staff, concierge, and even housekeeping staff were all warmly welcoming. Hotel management was friendly and helpful, and sent an unexpected small birthday surprise up to my room! All in all, I enjoyed a wonderful weekend at The Palace Hotel, and would definitely return again.</review>

What a gorgeous hotel.  The lobby is breathtaking.   Rooms are a little on the small side but they’re very well appointed with a great smell.   Beds are incredibly comfy as is to be expected in the Bonvoy Luxury collection.   The hotel bar looks very inviting.   Hotel restaurant is expensive but to be expected given the location.< /review>

<text>It was a grand hotel and good rooms. My stay taught me here that memories are made even more pleasant by the great attitude and service of staff. That was the case here, meeting and speaking to them gave a sense of home. Well done. The Royal Suite was fantastic. Thank you. 

There is room for even more improvement which I have highlighted. I am sure if you resolve those, it will be even more inviting and welcoming.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Great luxury hotel. Didn't stayed here but visited a friend. This hotel has a old world charm which is very good. The room is very spacious. Rooms are well maintained. The pool is also good. Many place of attraction nearby. Outside there are many homeless people and at night they are in groups.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Very good hotel. Clean, comfortable room & bed. En-suite was also very clean. Room was a bit noisy as we faced market street but overall experience was very good. Server that brought our room service up on the last day was a bit rude but when raised with manager, it was dealt with promptly. No English breakfast tea in the rooms, which is a bit inconvenient for tea drinkers like my husband and I. Also, we booked a room with breakfast for three but breakfast was only given for two. When we book bed and breakfast for 3 in a room, would expect to get breakfast for 3 as well, which, was a bit of a let down. Breakfast in the garden court restaurant was very good with a variety of selections. We ate at the Pied Piper restaurant as well and the food was very good. Kids menu is limited, though. Overall, very good hotel and would recommend it.<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Everything was great until... We went to the pool on a Sunday morning and there was a group of men squatting the tub and drinking from a 12 pack of coors light at 11am. When we mentioned to the front desk manager his answer was really inappropriate. He told us it was policy to allow guests to drink and he didn't see any problem with the brand image and the experience we had. He apparently hadn't heard that there was a call made to security and generally didn't seem to care. His overall handling of the situation was pretty incompetent and again not the kind of level of customer service you expect in a place like this.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Big fan of the Palace.  Beautiful lobby and common area.  Very spacious and comfortable rooms.  The Palace is not a boutique personal service hotel - it is big and you can expect a lot of folks in the bar and restaurant areas. It is a very lively and fun space to hang out, but the rooms are away from the din and are quiet. A rare combination and I applaud the Palace for achieving it.  Great location. Overall, an excellent choice albeit not an inexpensive one.</text>

<Review>What a wonderful property. An oasis of peace from a very busy city. Staff go beyond excellent to be of service. Rooms are spotless and comfortable.  Bathrooms are large and well set up. Garden Court Restaurant is just as I remember it 45 years later. Very European Grand. Food very good. Service beyond excellent with a full seating. This is a hotel with the vision of Grand and excellence in every way. You feel special and well cared for and above all comfortable.</Review>< Pictures>

For an older hotel this one is in amazing shape - you might have thought it was created recently and made to look classical.  Very upscale in all aspects.  Lovely area for lobby bar and restaurant area.  Good well poured drinks in Pied Piper.  Spacious well appointed rooms with really comfortable bed and nice bathroom.  Definitely would stay here again.<//Text>

A historic gem! An amazing property thats been updated with thoughtful details and design. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. 
Due to the hotels age, the rooms are a little smaller than a modern hotel. However, the design and cleanliness of the room more than make up for the size. 
The location is perfect  and has easy access to navigate the city. I took BART from SFO directly to the Montgomery Station, which is literally underneath the property. Super convenient and extremely easy.
You must have a drink in the Pied Piper Lounge and lunch in the Garden Court, just for the atmosphere alone. Absolutely stunning.
A beautiful building with a very nice staff. It was well worth the visit!</review>

Even though there were a few hiccups the staff was amazing. I would say the lounge staff was slow and I had to remind her of things. I don’t think they anticipated the crowd. The front desk was accommodating  and helpful even though the keycard has the wrong room listed than the key.  They corrected it and apologized.  All other aspects were wonderful. I spent my honeymoon at the palace 16 years ago so it was wonderful to be back and see the updates.<//Text>

The hotel is lovely with one main lounge area. The pool is small and the hot tub is tiny with children crowded in it. The location on market street was easy walking to union square and the ferry building. I was very disappointed upon checking out to be charged $72 a day for parking!!!!! This is really highway robbery.<//review>

<text>I travel nearly every week for business and typically cannot wait to get home. My stay at the Palace in San Francisco was one of the rare trips I’ve had where I wished I could stay longer. The hotel is the perfect blend of modern and classic. The guest room was generously sized for a city hotel.  

The glass ceiling lobby is impressive and always had a great energy every time I walked by. 

I’ve stayed a number of “classic hotels” in New York, New Orleans, and Chicago. The Palace is my new favorite.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Beautiful and clean hotel with ornate ballrooms. The staff appears to be all union so the service is sub par. Stop in to the lobby lounge or Pies Piper for a drink and some snacks.</text>

<text>The lobby is in fact really beautiful, but don't expect the same for your room, which is poorly maintained. The breakfast is definitely not a 5 star one: expect greasy food and not many healthy options. The staff is very friendly though. So, summarizing it is a very commercial hotel that looks more like a 4 star one. Wouldn't come back.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

The service was excellent but the room was a disappointment. It was spacious but had a very dated decor. The furniture looked like it was from the nineties. Even the holiday decorations looked old and out-of-date. It's a beautiful building if only it were updated.<//Review>

This hotel is gorgeous. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Garden Court Sunday brunch is a must do. I’d give this place 6 out 5 stars. I’ll stay here again<//Review>

<Review>I splurged and took 2 deluxe king rooms at the Palace Hotel, San Francisco for my son and myself for Christmas. I used my AAA discount and stayed only the nights my vacay money would afford. I researched and took enough cash for tips as well.

The hotel was beautifully decorated, the staff was extra cheery, friendly, and helpful and our rooms were exquisite. I chose the hotel from the photos of it's appealing historical architecture. I wanted a festive, nostalgic, Olde San Francisco ambience and this hotel delivered.

My son enjoyed the work out room and I enjoyed the pool and hot tub. We had in room service on Christmas morning and experienced friendly, courteous upscale dining.

The rooms had elegant architectural features and the baths were well equipped with high end features, and lovely bath amenities. 

We enjoyed chatting over drinks in the Pied Piper and picked up some Christmas Treats at the Giradelli on the corner without having to go outside in the rain.

My talented son played the grand piano in the lobby one night as we sat and enjoyed the architectural majesty of the Garden Court and the wonderfully decorated trees.

The staff was friendly and cheery and available at all times. 

We had a wonderful time and will probably go back.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The location was very handy for older visitors and close to many attractions and local transportation. The staff greeted us every morning at the breakfast buffet in the Crystal Garden, and the Concierge help us plan our activities and suggested restaurants. If you stay, I would recommend getting the buffet breakfast included in your package as it is a wonderful way  to start out your day. We had a great experience.<//text>< Pictures>

This is a great place to stay.  The location is walking distance to North Beach, Chinatown, SOMA, and a large shopping mall on Market St.  My room was clean and spacious, the toiletries very nice, the bed (as always) super comfortable.  The continental breakfast had the most delicious Greek yogurt and fresh juices, but pastries were average.  Really the only negative is that this Marriott has no smart tvs.< /Review>

<name>Michael< /name><review>This was my second  stay at The Palace for the Our & Equal Executive Forum.  All activities were on site and most attendees stay at the hotel.  Both trips/stays were without incident and during both stays I only encountered friendly and pleasant service - from the attendant at the door/curbside to the maintenance staff cleaning my room each day. The staff always inquired what else they might do for me - from advising where the nearest drugstore was to do you need a car to return to the airport.  The location is ideal and within walking distance of many San Francisco attractions.  A pleasure to walk in and stay at this fabulous, palatial hotel that are rare in today's hotel world - the palace is truly a "grande dame"!<//review>< userid>

Nice hotel.  Nice gym.  The rooms could be better sound insulated.  You can hear the noise from the street, from the corridor and from the rooms around.   This is because the place is old, but still....<//Review>

The room is large but: bathroom is tiny, one sink. Tough for two people staying 5 days that have functions to go to. There are no drawers to put clothes in. The closet is the size of a thimble. Had to request a coffee maker.  There is no such thing as a "City View". Paid extra for this and it is a second floor street view. Same view one would have looking out of a City bus window. Staff seem nice. I would certainly stay elsewhere.< /Review>

Before arriving at the Palace, we had spent the previous two nights at a rustic cabin in the Redwoods near Santa Cruz and we had had it with "rustic."  My wife said she was done with "rustic" and wanted luxury.  It was our last night in San Francisco and the Palace was perfect!  We hope to come again and we would strongly recomment the Palace to anyone with discerning tastes.<//review>

<Review>Take the hotel tour if you can. We were here for business conference. All staff were great and offered us bottled water. Spent 4 hours in the hot tub chatting with other guests.  Our room didn't have drawers, but they brought use a portable set, which worked well in our closet.  Internet was super slow, but they have upgrading coming to support Netflix streaming so that should help. Easy walk to the munni car that goes up and down market street to and from the wharf. Also liquor store across the street and wine shop right next door to the hotel.</Review>< Name>

<date>1557014400000</date><Rating>None< /Rating><text>Regarding my recent stay at the palace hotel I have a serious concern.  I had to be at a meeting at 7am and wake up at 6am. The room next to me was full of kids that were yelling and screaming. I understand this is not the hotels fault and out of your control, but what happened next was shocking.  

I knocked on the door and asked them to be quiet. No one replied and they kept yelling.  I knocked again and they continued to ignore me. At that point I came back to my room and talked to the front, explained the concern, and was assured that they would take care of it immediately. I let them know that I had to be up very early and so it was urgent.

15 minutes went by and no one came to the door or called the room. I was standing by the door waiting and I heard nothing. At that point I remembered that when we checked in we asked for a coffee maker and said it was urgent as we had to leave. It took ONE HOUR for the coffee machine to arrive.  I realized at that point this was not a coincidence, but instead another symptom of poor management.

I then called again 15 minutes later and the front desk staff sounded like I caught him off guard and instead of apologize, he lied and said they came to the door but there was no noise so he didn't do anything. I was in the room waiting the entire time and so I know this was a straight out lie. I then asked to speak to someone else and he put me through to security. I talked to them and they assured me it would be dealt with immediately. Again 15 minute went by and nothing happened. No knock on the door, no phone call. I called back and once again LIES.  They told me they spoke to them and asked them to be quiet.  I was standing by the door and NO ONE knocked. Straight out lie.

I then called again and demanded to speak to the manager. He told me he would move me to another room. I told him I was in bed trying to sleep and for third time I am begging them to just ask the kids to be quiet.  He called security and got them to knock and the door and within minutes they were quiet, which further showed me that the first two times were straight out lies.

So my concern is not that the kids were making noise. That happens. My concern is that you staff did nothing and then LIED and said they did TWICE. They didn't care that I said I had to wake up early and needed to sleep. They were only concerned about pretending they did their job.  

I thought this was a 5 star hotel?< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This was an average stay for me.  I have stayed in plenty of hotels throughout my lifetime.  Everyone was super friendly and the hotel was beautiful.  The parking was expensive, the valet was lacking, and the location was okay.  ( Close enough to Union Square.)</Text>

The Palace Team helped me create the perfect proposal and executed my vision from a far.  My heart is beyond full and grateful for every small detail created over this past weekend.  The Palace will always have a special place in our lives and we will return time and time again due to the kindness and extraordinary care that was provided by every member of the staff.  Special thanks to Ninja for caring for my crazy wishes on such short notice and ensuring perfection.< /Text>

<review>This hotel is definitely what you expect from a luxury 5-star hotel. The lobby and garden court are stunning. The rooms are super comfortable and well-designed. The bathroom smart toilet is wild, and a great feature! Overall this hotel is really nice and I would stay here again for sure. The only complaints I would have are that the WiFi is slow and unreliable, and the A/C never got very cold. I stayed during July when it was in the 60s outside, and the room was almost uncomfortably warm at times with no way to make the A/C cooler. Overall wonderful though!<//review><rate>None< /rate></record>

The Palace Hotel is a nice hotel but is over priced for the actual experience you receive.  Businesses like The Palace need to work with San Francisco to clean up the city.  Until that happens, they will see tourism dollars go elsewhere.<//review>

Well, i was there for one night. The air conditioning wasnt working. I went to reception at 10 PM to complaint. went again at 10:30 I was told that they have notified the engineer and he is looking into it. I think afterwards i slept waiting. Woke up at midnight (sweating as it was 78), called the helpdesk. got the same response. Went back again at 12:30 and then a manager called an engineer to fix. Robert came up to fix it and it took him like 5 mins. It seems it was some known issue which he was aware of. Overall, i couldn't sleep thru out the night when i was there to just sleep for that night!</Text>

Amazing!  The staff is attentive and very helpful.  The hotel has a lot of history.  I enjoyed its old world charm that never goes out of style.  The rooms are up to date and are spacious.  Its located near all attractions.  I will definitely stay there next time I'm in San Francisco.  Thank you for making it a memorable stay.<//review>

<Text>I stayed at the Place Hotel for a recent business trip. If you work in the Financial district, the hotel is a great location for you. It is an easy walk from the hotel to anywhere in that district. I work at the Salesforce Tower, and it was about a half mile walk.

The Hotel  lobby is beautiful, and the room comfortable, clean, and quiet (as requested). 

This is the third hotel I stayed in for recent travel to San Francisco, and I like this one the best by far.<//Text>< Pictures>

Took my wife to The Palace for her 50th birthday weekend. Wonderful atmosphere that fits a special occasion. The service is top notch: friendly, helpful, and welcoming. The property is well-maintained and clean. Had tea at the GC Lounge, which was perfect for the occasion, and dinner at the Pied Piper, which was cozy. Loved the Fitness Center and the proximity to all things downtown. The only shortcomings were street noise in our streetside room and lack of a coffee maker to heat up water.<//Text>

<Name>Kristi Clark<//Name><Time>1545193972184</Time><Text>Luxury hotel in all respects, one of the few that has modernized (GREAT design in lobby, restaurants and rooms) while managing to retain the historic elegance of this grand hotel in San Francisco. We were there for business and pleasure, and this downtown hotel is close to many sights. We brought our dogs and the hotel was quite lovely about it very accommodating, but I do not advise bringing dogs because taking them outside, including within the same block, was a rather harrowing experience because of the many homeless, especially at night. Because there are no opportunities to eat inside the hotel with the dogs (such as outer edge of bar, etc., as many hotels are now affording), we ordered room service. It was SENSATIONAL!  Every morsel of every course was utterly delectable. The hotel is professionally and charmingly well staffed, and all services orchestrated without a hitch. The beds are heaven!  I would give 5 stars if we didn't have to be so nervous about walking in the area because of the many suffering and drugged out homeless, and if the hotel offered a dog friendly area to enjoy its wonderful food. All around, though, it was a 5 star experience!</Text><user_id>104388866490678657687<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//Gmap_id><Response>None<//Response>< pictures>

<Review>I wanted to love this place. Chose this because of its reputation.  The hotel is old and though the upkeep must be challenging and costly, the amount paid doesn't reflect both the stay and service.  Marriott needs to allocate more funds and restore the prestige this hotel represents.  Worst part about this was not being informed that they would shut off the water for maintenance and unexpectedly seeing rust color water with black specs that stained the tub. Just absurd no notice was given in advance.</Review><Rate>4<//Rate>< Response>

We spent a week at the beautiful Palace Hotel. The location was excellent and staff members provided us with superior service.
The food served at the daily buffet in the Garden Court Restaurant was wonderful with a wide selection including salmon, eggs benedict and many other items. The indoor pool and jacuzzi were also terrific.</text>

-Three rooms in the course of two night stay due to issues with the rooms. 
-Food quality-Sub-par
-Food service- Non-existent
-Internet Service-Poor 
The best part of my stay was checking out. The entire staff needs training on communication and engagement. This is a reactive environment rather a proactive environment and it shows. This is the first hotel stay I have experienced with Marriott where I had to assert myself, not as an Ambassador Elite, but as a person in order to have issues addressed and demand respect. While the hotel may have historic merit, the staff and the room quality leave much to be desired.<//text>

We completely enjoyed our 2 nights at the Palace Hotel. This is the definition of great service in an exceptional historic property. The Garden Court has no peer in beauty and service. We attended Hamilton at the Orpheum and Bart is literally 2 steps from the Palace and 2 steps from the Orpheum. This is the way to stay in San Francisco!</Review>

<text>I was thrilled to be invited to a conference at The Palace.  The conference I attended for several years recently moved to another city, and I didn't think I'd be back there for an event.  The hotel is beautiful.  The staff is great.  And the neighborhood is one of my favorites.  I walk down to the Ferry Building every time and it was just a joy to be able to do that again.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

They brought our baby a crib & made sure we had everything and more we needed. Extra slippers, robes, waters & chocolates at night. Our children ordered room service around the clock & breakfast was quite punctual. The fitness center was great & the pool was too! Our whole family used them!!< /review>

< Review>
Beautiful hotel and great location! Service was top notch, facility exceptional, food amazing! Really no complaints about the entire stay. It definitely feels like a luxury hotel and the main room is beautiful! One of the nicest I have ever seen. Only recommendation is that the airport shuttle left something to be desired. Although a great price point - I would have been willing to pay a little extra to be transported in a nicer passenger van that was organized by the hotel. Left something to be desired about the E2E customer experience at a luxury hotel. Overall, definitely a repeat next time I am in San Fran!<//Review>

Very rude and hostile Doorman. I was staying in the hotel from in December of 2018.  During check out, I parked my car in front of the hotel so that I could bring my luggage from upstairs.   The doorman (his name is Norman) warned me with a very rude attitude that I could not park my car in front of the hotel for more than 10 minutes.  I tried to explain him that I was a hotel guest and going to bring my family and luggage as soon as I could.  He did not allow me to even finish my sentence, interrupted me while I was talking, and pointed finger at me while he was talking.  He again told me "10 minutes! and after that you will get a ticket" .  I stayed in many hotels in my life, and I know that in the hotel loading/check in area the police never gives ticket.  also it is the doorman/valet staffs responsibility to assist guests with loading/unloading the car.  He was not helping at all, instead was very rude, hostile,.before I was leaving I asked his name, he again with a very 'authoritative' tone replied "Norman the doorman' and did not even look at me.  Extremely disappointing and unexpected from a luxury hotel staff.  I experienced better trained, and far better mannered employees in motels.
It is a shame that such a beautiful hotel has such ugly attitude employees.<//text>

<username>DustinM< /username><rate>None</rate><Review>The Palace hotel is an amazing luxury experience that everyone should take a moment to try. The grand spaces inside are classic old world architecture with craftsmanship indicative of master builders. The atriums are gorgeous and the staircases are elegant. Service here rivals the surroundings, every member of the staff are welcoming and engaged in making your comfort a priority. The restaurants and in-room dining are exceptional! This hotel is so inviting you may find yourself so relaxed, you may delay your site-seeing or heading to that convention. San Francisco is an amazing city, but the Palace Hotel makes it a truly enchanting experience!<//Review>< Response>

It's been quite a few years since my last stay at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco but I'll be back. Rooms have been 
nicely refurbished; room darkening drapes, comfy bed, beautifully clean, convenient fridge. Great gym which was
clean and well tended by Lydia, beautiful buffet breakfast (the fruit!) and helpful/friendly staff everywhere (as I was 
slightly struggling to get out of my room with my luggage a passing engineer, on a service call to a nearby room, asked
if I needed any help ...). 
Special thanks to Jelly at the front desk. So helpful at check-in and check out (she found a discrepancy on my bill 
and removed the charge).<//review>

<Review>The stay at the Palace was just as enjoyable this time as it was during a previous stay.  The staff was friendly from check in to check out.  Nikki, our Server in Pied Piper was such a people person.  I didn’t get the names of those that tended to us during breakfast, but were just as friendly.

The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  I cannot wait for our next visit.</Review><userid>None< /userid><Response>None<//Response><rate>None< /rate>< GmapID>

A disappointing stay at this elegant and centrally located hotel. Poor service, logistical issues and a lack of care on a number of occasions negatively impacted our stay. Unfortunately when given the opportunity to take action (we sent an email to the manager our first night) the management chose not to act. A great shame and meaning we won’t be back to stay on our next trip to San Francisco.< /text>

stayed for 5 days 4 Nights in Palace Hotel. I really enjoyed my stay here.

This used to be one of the tallest buildings in San Fransisco in the late 19th Century. Now, Palace hotel is one of the most luxurious hotels in SF.

I love the architecture. It's classic, classy, cozy and clean. The Lobby lounge looks stunning. The Room is spacious. Love firm matrass and the soft pillow.

The service is excellent. I still remember when I was sitting on one of the couches, one of the hotel staffs offered me bottle waters and Girardelli Chocolate with warm greeting and smile. Loved it.

Location wise, it's only 5 minutes walk to Union Square where all hign end boutiques located. If you are a big fans of chocolate and ice cream, The SF legendary Ghirardelly Chocolate & Ice Cream is located at one of its corner on the ground floor.

Will surely recommend this hotel to my fellow Indonesian tour leaders, travel agencies & business partners.< /text>

Huge disappointment. Desk clerks were hurried and rude. Trash was in room when I arrived. Cups were dirty, room was super dusty, vents were covered in thick dust. Lamp was broken, toilet paper holder broken.... really really not worth the money. Customer care completely unresponsive. They charge $15 for wifi... what a scam. Trying to get my money back but will probably have to just get the credit card company to do a chargeback. Totally absurd and horrific customer service. Barely a 3 star hotel in my opinion.</review>

<Text>I had a wonderful stay at the Palace hotel in SF on 1/5/19. I was taken very good care of from the car men , doorman , luggage men and especially Jelly who works at the front desk. Jelly has amazing customer service skills and she really went above and beyond in making sure my stay at the Palace hotel went amazing. I was lucky enough to stay in the Presidential suite and I had a unforgettable experience. I will make the Palace hotel SF my go to hotel when staying in SF. Again thank you Palace hotel management and especially Jelly for making my stay truly amazing ! 10/10 stars all the way !  See you guys soon Palace hotel !!!</Text><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmapID>< username>

<review>Nice hotel! I stayed in 2004 and really enjoyed it. Then, living in SF on and off more recently, I'd pass by and/or find myself there for various events.  Was just there in March 2019 for a meeting in the ground floor ballrooms, and it's still a very nice space but would love to see them spruce it up just a little.<//review>< Rate>

Very impressive hotel. The vibe is certainly elegance. The hotel has an excellent spot in the city for families and business travelers alike. There are good food options in the hotel, as well as in the area surrounding the hotel. The rooms are both modern and historic-feeling all at once; not an easy feat to pull off.</text>

<resp>None</resp><review>First and worst, they lied to me. Wedding anniversary, wife born/raised in the city. Wanted a nice old time SF experience, platinum SPG, supposed to get some kind of upgraded room. Called the day before to be certain they knew it was anniversary stay, gentleman at front desk without prompting said "Oh, I see it's your anniversary, we've upgraded you to a junior suite." Great.

Check in, you get a standard room, sir, 300 square, zero upgrades available. Closet of a room, cupboard of a bathroom with one of the three worst showers I've ever had in my life. A stale cake for the anniversary celebration, safe and telephone don't work. Shown an alternate room, even smaller, bathroom impossibly smaller than the first, but you get a fancy Toto toilet seat. See end.

This - a Luxury Collection Hotel.

Hotel does not have any sort of a dinner restaurant, just at the bar in the Pied Piper (see separate review of that).

There is a magnificent stained glass ceiling in the court, breakfast and some drinks (bartender here single bright spot of the hotel). Lovely public room, but you can just walk in from another hotel to enjoy.

Can't measure the level of disappointment with all the great previous experiences we've had with Luxury Colleton Hotels. Is it just this hotel or welcome to the fresh h€ll that is Marriott? ** only because of the magnificent court.

Oh - the toilet seat, heated, blows air on your derrière, but short seat doesn't leave room for a man's, uhm,  package ... Silly, worthless substitute for a proper luxury accommodation.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML-DRiGJrqbZGYDKli66sR4fJYOaHiWM72HAN0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Daughter was fine. It has a beautiful glass ceiling above the general Cafe seating area near the lobby. That general lobby area is worthwhile a visit even for bypassing tourists who do not stay at the hotel. The rooms are fine. The hotel is only a few blocks from the moscone conference center and the modern art museum.<//text>

I have long wanted to stay at the Palace because of its history, its architectural style and it reputation.  We were certainly not disappointed!  The property it is in a wonderful location with easy access to points of interest.  The staff did a fantastic job of meeting each and every one of our needs and made us feel truly special  I would highly recommend this as a property that you should make a priority to stay at!<//Review><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</gmapID>< UserId.>

<review>Great old luxury hotel. Most rooms and suites are of a good size and we'll maintained. Nice pool and workout area that is rarely crowded. Weekend brunch in the atrium is excellent.

Attended a work holiday event at the Palace, and I loved the layout. The building has a nice charm, and the staff were very friendly to guests. The acoustics were also great as we had two different rooms with music. Neither of them had bled into other areas. I'd happily attend another event there.</Review>

A beautifully restored room,  however small and small bathroom,  no complimentary coffee or tea in the room. Great staff in the Garden Court  cafes. Friendly and accommodating. Delicious food.

This location is a jewel amidst the tightly packed hotels of San Francisco. Not only is it lovely with its hight ceilings and marble pillars but the atmosphere they create with their friendly staff and excellent service take you back in time to old San Francisco. If you are traveling for pleasure or business I highly recommend this lovely location with its clean and comfortable rooms and classically European public spaces.<//Review>

The Palace Hotel is that rare old world hotel that has been impeccably updated with luxurious details without sacrificing the soul and tradition of the property. I especially loved the Frette linens and Byredo toiletries in room. Room service was decadent and delicious. Room was impeccably clean and quiet, perfect for my business travel reason for staying. 
I would have loved to have some means to boil water in the room in the am so I could make tea without having to travel to the lobby, but otherwise, I will be staying at the Palace again!< /review>

Girardely; if you are going to the city for a treat on your day off, then you want to do it right. Indulge yourself once in a while with a Girardely ice cream sundae. The portions are very generous so make sure you share with a companion. Worth the extra time on the treadmill :) 🙃< /Review>

I gave this hotel a second chance after waking up to jackhammering the last stay with no previous warning that there would be construction.  There was construction this time also, however, we were moved to a "quiet room".  A room with no space to move in, no completed closet to hang clothing for 2 people, no chest of drawers for clothing, no counter space on the bathroom vanity, no proper drainage for showering, no shower door to avoid water getting all over the small bathroom floor.  2 people cannot fit in the bathroom at all, in fact it is smaller than a department store stahl in the public bathrooms.  The electrical outlet came out with the hairdryer plug.  Tv went out the second day in the second room they transferred us too.  Housekeeping didn't clean the room until we called and then we waited for an hour to get a towel at 3:30 p.m.  We also asked for 2 bars of soap because once the bar of soap went into the shower it was impossible to grab it without getting into the shower because of the design of the doorless shower.  In fact, turning on the shower was another project in itself on top of the water stoppage.   One apology from the manager which I insisted to talk to.  The lobby and restaurants are beautiful as the Palace always was... however, the recent year's renovations to the rooms make absolutely no sense to the "luxury" theme.  We were there for 4 functions and tried to rest in between and with the on and off-air conditioning units which there was no way to turn off, it was enough for us to call it quits on the hotel.  When we spoke of it to others that were attending the events there, they agreed they will be staying elsewhere.  Very disappointed.<//review>

Exterior and interior including tea room, garden court area are amazing, However, staff is poorly trained, snobbish and lazy. Front Desk and Checkin was nightmare, checkout line and asking someone to get car from valet was super tiring. Bath Room Hygiene was below any Bon Voy hotel . Traveled 60+ night last year and this was one bad experience enough to make me put review here.</review>

The legendary US customer service and even manners were absent.  The bedlinen required immediate changing upon arrival, seafood lunch was definitely a bit 'green'.  Hotel documentation with typos and room service carts left in halls, external noise echoing into the bedroom, toiletries not replenished, generally NOT a wonderful hotel experience.<//Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>The Palace is one of the grand ladies of a bygone era. You are transported back in time to experience a world of privilege and elegance. A living institution of majesty. It's regrettable the guest room corridors and the guest room themselves are so poorly and cheaply designed. It truly shows such disrespect for this truly magnificent hotel. The Garden Court is one of the most impressive interiors you'll ever experience, but unfortunately the furnishings and carpet are absolutely dreadful. Marriott has some of the finest hotels in the world and knows perfectly well how to design great hotels. They should be ashamed of what they've done to this incredible property.<//text><user>None< /user>< Response>

<gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmap_id><Review>I have stayed at this hotel before and was very pleased with service.  This time was very different.  Person that checked me in pretended as if she was upgrading me to a bigger room, but found out later that she had moved me to a handicap accessible room.  I needed a tub as I have small children and asked to be changed.  I had to call 3x and finally had a manager call me back saying he would move us.  We packed and got ready only to find out that the room he had only had one bed and was not a comparable room.  We ended up staying at the same room.  We then asked for hot water.  We were told to come get it from lobby.  Went to the lobby to find out there was no water and was told to order from room service.  The person at front desk said he would order for me.  I waited for 1hr and called room service.  They pretended as if no one has ordered and took my order as new and eventually delivered.  This is not what I expect from a luxury hotel such as this.  Very disappointed and I don't believe I will ever stay at this hotel again.< /Review><Date>1575331200000<//Date><Rate>None<//Rate><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

The room is old and small but the worse is we need to wait long queue for breakfast!!!
This is my first time to queue for breakfast, and it cost me 85 Dollars just for a breakfast, with simply scrabble egg and bacon...</text>

<Text>Beautiful hotel, clean rooms and comfortable beds. The only downside, l wish they had hardwood floors instead of carpets.  My overall experience was good especially with Ruben at the front desk. He went above and beyond to ensure that l had a quiet room on a high floor. I am a local, so l only needed the room for the day to change for a photoshoot. I would definitely stay here again. Even though l didn’t go to the Pied Piper Bar this time, it’s a great bar with friendly staff.</Text><UserId.>None< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Love that The Palace is part of the American Express Platinum Card Fine Hotels program.  First, I love the hotel - it is beautiful.  I will be visiting San Francisco every 4-6 weeks this coming year and need a hotel with a high level of service.  The front desk service was excellent, but everything else was questionable.  I was able to check in early and check out late which is very helpful.  I understand the strike limited service, but the existing service was not great.  The breakfast buffet service was not good.  The Pied Piper service was poor.  One other thing was that when I had the Privacy please hanger on the door, I had the housecleaning enter twice during my stay.</Review>

The room was quiet and comfortable with a bath that the wife fell in love with. (I see a renovation my future) Transportation was readily available and the staff was very friendly. We arrived earlier than expected and was looking to have them hold our luggage, but they had a room available for us to check in giving us a great start to the vacation. Bell service gave us great advice we took advantage of and we were able to enjoy a wonderful stay. Will definitely do this again.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I have stayed at the Palace many times and it is always a most pleasant place to stay. The hotel is an icon of the past with a modern twist. The Pied Piper Bar is a great place to sip a Negroni before you make your way to a well appointed room that was spotlessly clean. The rooms are stylish but not trying too hard. Take advantage of the complimentary shoe shine and turn down service. The staff was friendly and professional. The location is perfect with access to public transportation.<//review>

Location is great, staffs are very friendly, the room is very comfy and clean, bed is perfect, fitness centre and swimming pool are luxury experience for me, restaurants serving breakfast and dinner and drinks are awesome, foods are made delicious and well quality.

It would be better to place a coffee/tea making facilities inside the guest room.< /text>

<Review>I have stayed at the Palace Hotel three times, and each time is wonderful. I really enjoy the old-world grandeur of the common areas with the juxtaposed modern room style. The breakfast is great. The Pied Piper restaurant is also nice. The location is perfect as well. It's my go-to for Sf trips. I use the American Express Fine Hotels program for extra benefits.</Review></record></dataset><record>

We’ve stayed at this hotel several times in the last year. Great hotel in an excellent location. Service was perfect all around.  The staff even brought birthday cake to my room!  The only concerns  to our stay this time was that 1) there were no drawers in the room, however the concierge did bring up a dresser when we asked  2) there was absolutely no view from the window.  We faced some part of another building which allowed no light into the room, making the room very dark.   I like natural bright light during the day. 3) this time, we found that the room and bathroom was a little small for a guest/suite.</review>

<Review>This hotel is quite grand.  The guest rooms are spacious and exceptionally clean, and the daily cleaning service makes sure they stay that way.  There are a number of extras that make your stay special including robes, slippers, waterfall showerhead, heated toilet seats, etc.  Also, the bathroom has enough space for all of your toiletries.  Wonderful hotel and very close to tons of things to do.  It is within walking distance of the wharf, and you can rent bikes nearby to ride across the Golden Gate Bridge.  Even the public transportation is within a block which you can easily take to Oakland or to Haight/Ashbury.  The concierge will tell you which line to get on.  We had no issues getting around without a car and always felt safe doing so.< /Review>< Date>

My wife and I stay exclusively at The Palace Hotel whenever in San Francisco, whether for business (me) or pleasure (she and I), for the luxury, location,and royal treatment provided by this wonderful hotel.  We were aware of the labor strike prior to our arrival, yet decided to stay anyway, knowing that The Palace staff would do everything that they could to make guests feel comfortable and accommodated. We made the right choice.


  


Although the staff was undoubtedly under stress due to the strike, everyone we were in contact with was cheerful, helpful, and went out of their wayto make our stay a typical stay at The Palace: excellent.  The property was up to its usual standards for cleanliness, and the staff for their professionalism. 


  


My wife left a sentimental keepsake, valuable only to her, in the room by mistake, and the Security and housekeeping staff went out of their way tofind and return the item to her.


  


We will continue to frequent The Palace Hotel as our home away from home while in San Francisco.< /Review>

How is this place considered part of the luxury collection is beyond me. The walls between rooms are so thin I could hear next room’s guests snoring all night. Also, they expect you to wait for a table at breakfast for over 30 minutes and the host was definitely rude.  This is the last time I consider this hotel. Very disappointed.</Review>

I had the pleasure of staying at this lovely hotel. Wow!! The rooms were luxurious and the hotel itself was beautiful. The location is perfect. Many great restaurants within walking distance and easy location to get around.
What really stood out for me though, was the amazing staff. They were so courteous and helpful. A special thank you to Jenny Lee. She greeted us when we checked in. We mentioned that we came to San Francisco to celebrate my birthday. When we came to our room for the evening there was a bottle of champagne on ice with the kindest note from her. That was truly amazing and so thoughtful.
Thank you to all the staff at the Palace hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco!< /text>

They went out of their way to accommodate me and any concern i had, like switching rooms on the first night due to loud neighbor.  Location is great and the rooms are very comfortable.  Will definitely stay again!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Love this place! Stay here one weekend a month, every month!!! The hotel is elegant and the staff super helpful and kind.
My only complaint is that as soon as you step outside you WILL be accosted by panhandling homeless and drug-addicts that won’t leave you alone....<//Text>

We’ve been gusts at the luxury collection hotels many time before. Because we live close by and had a tight schedule this weekend, I decided to surprise my wife and kids and spend a night at The Palace hotel for a quick getaway to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my daughter’s birthday. I emailed the day before and called simply asking for a note to be put on our beds for both my wife and daughter nothing else. To my surprise there was nothing there when we arrived. I also pre paid for breakfast the next day and made a reservation since I knew we need to leave early as we had other obligations that day. We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation that morning and surprise to know that our name wasn’t listed. We had to wait more the 30 minutes, rush through breakfast (my wife didn’t even had a chance to eat) and then late for our next commitment in the city.</review>

Very impressive. Concierge was great. Staff on the street coordinating loading luggage and unloading luggage for Hotel guests, and hailing cabs were particularly friendly and efficient. Best I have ever seen. With the traffic roaring down New Montgomery, they handled it. Safety first. Great Job! With a keen eye, I watched this unfold. Very pleasant experience in the Garden Court for Sunday Brunch. Great wait staff. "Two Thumbs Up" for your attention to detail and "Excellence" at the Palace Hotel at large.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I attended a 3 day event at Palace hotel. All though I didn't stay at the hotel, my experience around the common area facilities was amazing! It is beautifully, lavishly decorated in the lobby area. Rest rooms complete with golden colored faucets, full height doors and heavy towel. Restaurant food is both delicious and beautiful to look at. I will definitely come back to stay!</Text>

<review>An older property with a good deal of charm. Good service. Only complaint is the bathroom setup is kind of strange - the shower has a partial door, so the bathroom floor gets flooded. Makes using the bathroom inconvenient.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Beautiful building. Room service and breakfast didn't meet expectations considering the price and wait.  $20 for basically a Totinos pizza and $80 dollars for a $12 bottle of wine.... and over an hour wait.  Go once for the history,  don't go back because of the service.</Text>< pictures>

Up until today, I've always had a great experience at The Palace in San Francisco. Today though, I called to request a credit card authorization form, as I have booked a room here for a co-worker, but needed to put the expense on my credit card. After speaking with two individuals at the hotel, I was told emphatically that the policy was that you must request a credit card authorization 72 hours in advance. I was told over and over that this was a policy of the hotel, with no real reasoning behind it. As a Platinum Elite Marriott Bonvoy member, I would highly recommend that the Marriott team review their policies and procedures, and take into account how these policies affect the business traveler staying at their hotels. As someone who books hotels last minute for work, 99% of the time, sending a credit card authorization form 72 hours in advance is not even a possibility. Now, I'm forced to make the choice if I can even keep this reservation, or go to another hotel that can accommodate my needs.< /text>

A beautiful hotel, but the rooms don't quite hit the 5 star mark. They are missing a few amenities that would truly make it a luxury experience, such as a makeup mirror, that I've seen at other hotels of this caliber. Additionally, the area surrounding the hotel feels unsafe. Walking the short block to the nearby 7-eleven was kind of scary at night!< /text>

If you are into Historic Old Hotels, this one is very well done. However the rooms are very tiny. Room service is great. The bums all over outside, not so much. Don't think we would return, prices are spendy and not 5 star worthy to us. Gift shop was very limited as well.<//Review>

it was a majestic summer family vacation choice! The attentiveness to detail with our stay is always so memorable. Luis at front desk was engaging and a greeted us with a warm genuine smile. The best part of our stay was Jose and Malia,....true ambassadors of the city and the hotel. They made us feel welcomed and very special. We cant thank your team enough for creating the best memories for our family vacation! Until next time....thank you for our wonderful stay!<//Text>

I stayed at the Palace due to its proximity to the start location of the SF Half Marathon. Also, it is one of a handful of downtown SF hotels with a swimming pool and jacuzzi. It’s a short 15 minute walk to the Ferry Building and SF Playhouse. 

The electric socket in the bathroom wasn’t working so I had to dry and curl my hair in the desk area and I slightly burned my finger as I didn’t have a mirror. Also, I heard other guests talking outside my room, so it’s not as soundproof as I’d prefer. However, I enjoyed the lovely lounge area and had an overall wonderful hotel experience otherwise.< /text>

I've stayed at the Palace multiple times in my lifetime on most of my stays in San Francisco.  I'm always eager to return.  On the few times I've chosen to stay elsewhere just for variety, I'm still back at least one morning for breakfast at the Palm Court.  The experience of enjoying a meal in this special place can't be duplicated.   The atmosphere is outstanding.  I've been coming since I was a teen and I continue to be excited to be back.  The Pied Piper is also a favorite SF bar spot.    Rooms are always spacious and comfortable.  There is nothing not to like about this great hotel that's been a part of San Francisco heritage for over 100 years.< /Text>

<review>Definitely the best value for money hotel you can find in SF. Sometimes the price can be the same or even less than 4 star boutique hotels in the city but the quality is way better. The whole hotel is classic and beautiful. The room is spacious compared to most hotels in SF, and room decor is charming. Service is also good except for a few bad experiences I have had with the waiting staff at the Garden Court and the lounge. You would definitely expect better service from a hotel of this standard.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< UserId.>

Please do not stay here. If you are coming for work, they will lose your packages, laundry etc. Drunk and intoxicated staff and management. Save yourself the time, hassle and good night sleep and stay anywhere else in San Francisco and it will be better than this. Worst Marriott property in the country hands down.  I've stayed 100 nights this year and this Marriott and its staff are the winner for absolutely worst most embarrassing hotel experience of my life. My company is embarrassed and they are not allowing any of our 1000 employees to ever stay here again.< /text>

The palace is gorgeous, the guest room was immaculate, the staff was friendly and accommodating. Great value for the price, too. A bit of a hike from fisherman's wharf but the bus and street car are right outside and cable cars are a block away.</Text>

Great hotel with amazing bathrooms. The rooms are remodeled and huge comfortable beds! We had great service from every one and it’s walking distance to so much. Parking was pretty expensive but we used a lot 1 block over for half the price. We would recommended this hotel again.</text>

We had an exceptionally wonderful experience at the Palace Hotel in downtown San Francisco. Not only because the hotel is at a very convenient central location that is a few steps away from the BART and MINI public transportation stations, and its marvelous Garden Court restaurant/lounge settings, but also because of its very friendly and efficient staff members. We will certainly go back to stay at this hotel again in the future.< /Review>

<Review>I have stayed here quite a few times and have never had a less than stellar experience!  The hotel is a beautiful example of old San Franciscan architecture.  It is beautiful.  The rooms are cozy and warm with beautiful views and the location is perfect for exploring.  The level of service here is outstanding.  Enjoyed the beautiful indoor pool and gym.  Highly recommend!<//Review>< Name>

We had the pleasure visiting San Franciso January 2019.
This city was our last stop finishing off our Xmas and New year 2 week holiday.
So the second time to San Francisco we decided to stay at The Palace Hotel, and we were not disappointed.
From the moment you walk in and take in the Grand design, the presentation, the history and the fitout , all the way to check-in and everything in between our brief stay.
Congratulations San Fran on  your   beautiful treasure.< /Review>

< review>
Incredible Hotel with absolutely the best customer service. We were welcomed at the front desk by Jenny Lee who exceeded all expectations at greeting us and providing us options on upgrading our room. This was our 15 th wedding anniversary; she was unbelievably professional, cordial, and really nice facilitating a fantastic stay at your beautiful hotel. We would stay there again just because of her. This was one of our best hotel experiences. Everyone in your hotel said good morning or good evening from the cleaning staff to the room service personnel. We ordered some food items and wine to be delivered to our suite for entertaining some guests and it was perfect. Thank you Palace and thank you Jenny for making our four night stay very special. On another note, I am sure you realize that you have the number one concierge in the Western World in Debbie Lew.</review>

The stay at the hotel was delightful otherwise, helpful, friendly and kind staff, comfortable and spacious rooms, a gorgeous pool. We would stay there again, provided there was no picketing.</Text>< Pics>

A stay at the Palace hotel will create a sense of relaxation and an appreciation of the history of a 'grand dame' from a by-gone era and yet remains relevant today.  Great location and wonderful ambience!</text>

Stayed at the Palace Hotel...great room with wonderful amenities and one of the best and comfortable beds I have ever slept in...my only issue was the location of the room which was next to the elevator thereby causing me to hear every time the doors opening and closing plus the noise of visitors walking the hall and the slamming of rooms doors...not a great situation !  An otherwise great trip.<//review>

<pics>None</pics><review>Stayed here just before christmas for one night. SPG recognition was great - free suite upgrades and automatic late checkout. Front desk staff (Casey) were great on check-in and really made us feel welcome. Rooms are fantastic - best I've stayed in with SPG. My only issue comes with the bar, both facilities and staff. For such a luxurious hotel, the bar was fairly average and could definitely have been better. This issue was compounded by staff who were not especially attentive or seeking to help. In fact, we were informed at 11:30pm that it was last call for the bar (apparently standard practice, though this seems very early for a city center hotel). Hearing this, we took a moment to decide on our drinks and headed to the bar, only to be told that choices were limited to beer and wine (with 25 minutes still to serve?!). No apologies from the bartender, just the impression that we the guests were standing between him and the end of his shift. 
Would I stay there again? Yes, absolutely. Would I choose to visit the bar again? No.< /review>< resp>

<text>This is by far my favorite hotel in San Francisco from the location, decor, history, luxury amenities, etc. and especially great staff like Rawan, one of their managers! I have stayed here for work but also for special occasions and she never fails to make sure my stay is nothing short of fabulous! If I could live here, I would. I only discovered this hotel late December 2016 but make every effort to stay here when I am in town. It reminds me of the Plaza in New York and is wonderful at Christmas time with all the decorations. This is truly the way 5 star hotels should be globally! The gym and pool are also great!</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<review>Spectacular Birthday Weekend! This was my first time staying at the PALACE, but it will not be my last. The food was amazing! Full of flavor, right sized and served by exceptional staff. Valet, Bellman, Room service were some of the very best I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. The Palace was full every night with Holiday parties, but that did not detract from our service. Everyone was attentive, helpful and made sure we were given 100% personal care. It was simply lovely.< /review></record>

Great central location (Union Square), valet parking (Pricey but convenient). Although the hotel was built-in 1875, it has gone through a series of renovations which has kept the original vision and charm, the glass doomed atrium is magnificent.
The staff were a delight and very helpful.< /text>

I actually looked forward to returning the hotel each evening for one of the most enjoyable hotel stays I've had in quite some time. The combination of elegance, comfort, and professionalism contributed to an enjoyable and productive trip. I will be returning to the Palace!< /Review>< pics>

Loved the Palace Hotel, which can be proud of a superb staff, historic finest at its best, and an overall luxury experience. That said, the cost of the experience dips just bit on the "bit too much" side. Look to stay on a lower cost night and opt for "breakfast included," but pass for longer stays or on their more costlier nights.< /Text>

<Review>I first like to say Janet at front desk is example of perfect customer service!  

Stay was was very positively memorable. Even with the citywide union labor action against Marriott / SPG, the staff here made the visit pleasurable. (I have to support Marriott on this one even as a diehard liberal I am. If customer wants to save environment on passing on housekeeping then there will be less jobs. More important that all get living wage for the jobs that are available. Not pad a payroll with people that don’t have enough to do)<//Review>< Gmap_id>

My family and I stayed over a weekend night as part of a holiday staycation and are already looking forward to returning. 

The public spaces were decorated gorgeously, my daughter loved getting offered chocolates at check-in, and we loved the generous suite upgrade. 

We had two meals during our stay. The breakfast had a good selection, and the small upcharge to the full buffet felt reasonable. Lunch at the Pied Piper Bar had great ambiance, though also felt expensive for the quality. 

Nevertheless we loved our time at the Palace.< /text>

<rate>None<//rate><review>The indoor pool at this hotel seemed to be almost a 25 yard pool and the temperature was nice for lap swimming, but not too cool for others. The pool hours were nice being five am to ten pm. The hotel's location is excellent. BART and Muni both have stops outside the hotel doors. Union Square is extremely close. I found the staff very friendly. The room had everything that I needed. I love how historic the hotel is and it feels so elegant.< /review>< pics>

Fantastic hotel with brilliant staff! loved everything about the hotel, we loved the Spa and the lobby is so beautiful. The room was really comfortable and clean. Best bit about the staff was the fantastic five star service from all the staff but especially the concierge who went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect.<//Review>

It's smack in the middle of AT&T Park, Exploratorium, Fisherman's Wharf, and many more. Most of the staff were great. Janet was very welcoming, kind, helpful, and confident. She did well. There was one bellman, standing on the bell desk, whom displayed nothing but his wishful thinking for being elsewhere. I asked to have my bags stored in the storage for 2-3 hours, but he didn't even give a single eye contact. Other than that, my stay was enjoyable. The room was very pleasing, especially the vanity mirrors, lamps, comfort of the bed, and the high ceiling. I didn't experience any external noise admitting into the room. The fitness center and the pool did the job. Of course, the beautiful lobby was breathtaking, much like the Pied Piper Mural. Check-in and check-out went smoothly.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Hillary04< /Name><Response>None</Response><userid>None< /userid></record></dataset><record>

$7.00 for a subpar expresso and $6.00 for a cop of coffee?  The buffet was $40.00, and the American Breakfast was $26.00
Parking was a bit expensive too at $72.00 for overnight.< /review>< pictures>

The Palace hotel is a classic, timeless SF institution, and it remains so under Marriott's stewardship.  The Garden Court restaurant and Pied Piper lounge are both unique and highly recommended.  Housekeeping staff is top notch, and facilities are nicely maintained.  Gym and an indoor pool are really nice onsite amenities as well.  We will certainly return.< /text>

<text>I was thrilled with this hotel.  The bed was so Comfortable with a pillow top mattress,  high thread count sheets and quality pillows.  The bathroom had a fabulous rain shower head, electronic toilet with settings for every need,
robes and slippers, oh and giant towels.
The room was appointed with leather pulls on suitcase like drawers an extra chair, desk and a  very large TV.
This hotel was built in 1875 and the architecture is amazing.  I felt like I was back in Europe in a grand castle.<//text><rating>5< /rating>< gmapID>

< Review>
After having gone without sleep for 22 1/2 hours, I pulled the sheets back only to find that the matress was wood (both beds).  I believe the matress was upside down.  They fixed it the next night but did not compensate me for having sleep on a board - not to mention the screaming kid in the next room at 4AM.  The staff was very night and warmly greeted you all the time, and the historical aspects of the hotel were very neat.</Review>

<text>Very beautiful hotel, but service and staff training and attention to detail is very lacking. Housekeeping knocked once then barged in, bellman called me because he couldn't find both of my bags in storage at first, then also tried to come in to the room uninvited. Front desk person was a impatient with questions and then didn't call when the room was ready, I had to come back and ask. Every interaction so far has not been up to five star service standards.< /text>< user>

<text>Despite the impressive architecture and central location with good "hardware", the lacking of software "service quality of staff" reduce the effective image that Luxury Hotel Group tried to achieve.  Being from Asia, we used to the genuine 5 to 6 stars treatment that is so well executed throughout and consistently, what I experienced in SFO is far from that level.</text><gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</gmap_id></record>

<Text>Had a conference here, and didn’t want to stay here again after the first experience.. but gave it another try.
Old rooms, with closets that have no hanging space.   Hanging bars in closet, but shelves right below, so you can’t actually hang anything..who designed this??
Small bathrooms, with one sink, even in a “Jr. suite”
Lots of noise from street below
Several things in the room were broken.
Will not stay here again!</Text></record>

If cities are themselves museums, then staying in an historic hotel adds tremendously to the visit. The Palace is stunning in design, in preservation, in upkeep. no detail of the building should be missed, and the location is outstanding. seems strange in 2018 that there was no in-room wifi, and i was not happy to hear from my airport shuttle driver that i should have been provided a pass for a free ($17) ride to the airport. but i still highly recommend this place, especially if you will have time for r & r, because the gathering spaces are remarkable !< /text>

I stay at the Palace when traveling on business frequently. Often enough in fact that many of the front desk staff remember me we I check in or out. That is such a rarity and is truly appreciated particularly for such a large hotel. On one of my recent visits while checking in, I casually mentioned to Jerry at the front desk that I was coming back for a personal trip that it happened to be my birthday. When I was checking in for that stay, I was blown away by the royal treatment. The manager, Nina, personally greeted me and my wife. They upgraded my room and even had a few nice gifts waiting for me. It was already one of my favorite places to stay in SF and this gesture simply put it in a league of its own. Thank you!<//text>

The lobby is beautiful however the room lacks the 5 star ambiance. The food is more like a 4 star than a 5. No comparison to an Aman hotel, for example. Wouldn’t come back.<//Review>

I had a wonderful stay here while my SO and I visited San Francisco. The staff was friendly and the room was very clean and overall worth paying for a hotel while we were in town. The cleaning staff were good about making sure we always had a tidy room with fresh towels and robes. There was a decent gym and indoor pool. I definitely would return on our next trip!<//review>

The palace hotel is a beautiful hotel and is located centrally close to Union Square. China town is an easy walk away and it is about 30 minutes walk to the wharf area. The rooms are well appointed and there is a great indoor pool, spa and gym that can be used year round. The staff were also very nice. When we arrived on Christmas eve there was quite a line to check in but staff handed out free water and chocolates and were kind enough to even provide free wifi for our stay due to the wait. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting San Fran.<//Text>

I went to California and stated at the Palace Hotel. The hotel is literally like a palace, grand, beautiful and stunning. The main hall looks the best. The rooms are good and spacious. The pool is okay. The breakfast was filling and had lots of choices in a buffet. Very close to the train 🚆station.</text>

The only thing that could have made my stay at the Palace Hotel even better would be to still be there! The hotel is beautiful and elegant, the rooms, restaurants, bars, pool and fitness center were all wonderful. And every staff member that I had the pleasure of interacting with was personable and professional. The whole stay was top-notch from start to finish.< /text>

<Text>Our family of four stayed at The Palace for three nights and couldn't have been more pleased. We enjoyed drinks and dessert at the Pied Piper - a must do - and worked out in the exercise facility. The hotel Staff was responsive and everything we needed was cheerfully provided. The lobby is gorgeous and the rooms were very clean. Once we got our bearings, we appreciated the proximity of this hotel to the shopping district. This hotel was the oasis for our City experience.</Text>< user>

<UserId.>None< /UserId.><review>Mostly a comfortable stay. The staff was all very nice but there is a major disconnect in terms of communication from front desk to housekeeping staff. At check in I was honored a 2 pm check out due to my SPG Gold status and was noted on my account. The day of check out I had 2 housekeepers knock on the door despite a do not disturb sign. I had already told the first housekeeper I had a 2 pm check out. The second one just barged on in.
It is pointless to offer a late check out benefit when you cannot relax due to the constant question: When are you leaving ?
I can see if I had requested this as a last minute benefit but it was noted at check in. 
On top of that the housekeeping staff is extremely loud talking to each other in the hallways and banging doors early in the morning. I ended leaving well before my requested check out time.
The hotel markets itself as a 5 star property. These issues are not reflective of that.< /review><Response>None</Response><Rating>None<//Rating></record>

< Review>
My husband attending a conference.  We went to breakfast and only had 1 key between us. I tried to get one at the desk. Refused because I didn't have picture ID, and my passport on my phone was not sufficient. I was bullied by the person at reception, had to wait 15 minutes for a security person to accompany me to my room, who then tried to push his way into the room, and jammed his foot against the door so I couldn't close it while I got my ID to show him. Took him another 5 minutes to relay to someone my name & DL # to someone.  I have NEVER been treated like a criminal because I didn't have a key, and I have travelled extensively, and stayed very often in way better hotels than this one. In other places I have always been treated with respect. I would never stay here again, and will likely just avoid Marriots in the future based on principle. I understand security. I don't understand rudeness, disrespect, bullying, and intimidation.<//Review>

<Review>Good Service. Small but very well furnished rooms. Bed and linens were excellent. Skip the breakfast - too expensive for what you get. The waiter tried to charge us the higher price buffet option.
If you are not staying there just come in and experience the splendor of the 1906 glass ceilings by hanging out in the lobby for a while watching people.</Review>< Pics>

Outstanding central location. Beautiful Garden Court restaurant for breakfast and tea is a stunning architectural gem. Very elegant and traditional. Good gym. Good pool and hot tub although pool, advertised as heated, is very cold and hot tub/Jacuzzi could have been warmer too. Public areas nice but aside from Garden Court not remarkable. Was in a superior suite. Pleasant and good quality furnishings but again nothing that stands out in terms of design. Closet in slightly awkward place by door but spacious bathroom with good storage, counter space. No upgrade available as a platinum premier elite in the rewards programme. I stayed during the union strike and temporary staff and managers were handling all the services so service was imperfect at best. Coffees and shower caps not refilled etc.  No room service and bar/restaurant had only one salad and one burger due to limited staff (however they were good and the breakfast buffet was very nice). The Marriott Marquis, where my family stayed, managed to provide better service despite being strike impacted. The website said they were operating normally. Had I known services were so curtailed I would have stayed elsewhere so they lose a star for service failures and failure to notify. But the staff that were here were friendly and helpful and kind and go out of their way for you. Might well be a 5 star experience without a strike (but if you like swimming, don't expect good water temperatures).<//Text>

Overall it was good. Very historic place and great location. Front desk employee was awesome. 
However, it was disappointing in a few areas.
First of all, there was consumed water next to new water. I almost drank water it was already consumed by someone else. 
Also, I requested several bath amenities by Marriott App. But, housekeeping didn’t send all items that I requested. So, I had to request again directly to him but he didn’t bring exactly again!!!!! I just let him go because we were very tired.
Finally, heater was not working well. I also heard other guest complained at the concierge desk. I think it is common problem in this hotel.</review>

<Text>As someone who travels a lot for work and pleasure, there is a certain standard you come to expect, especially at a luxury hotel.  Throw all of those expectations out the window if you intend to stay at the Palace because they will not meet them.  No valet will come help with your bags, the front desk staff will be rude and snarky, the food will be overpriced and taste lousy.  We stayed at the Fairmont in SF on an earlier stay and it was like night and day.  Do not waste your time with the Palace.</Text>< Pics>

It is a beautiful historic, well maintained hotel in a great central location. Restaurant is absolutely breathtaking. We were there for 4 nights, and didn't use a whole lot of the amenities, but we did appreciate our room being cleaned promptly every morning along with never having to make a call to housekeeping for something they forget. Excellent Service. We ate breakfast every morning at the buffet. There was more than enough good choices , but for me eating only oatmeal and fruit, $32 is a little pricey. The bar seemed to always have people in it. Again, it was classy and the painting above the bar breathtaking. Good place to hang after dark, since it's too freaken cold in San Francisco to do anything at night without a winter coat. That was the only downside to the entire trip. I loved the hotel, and am glad I stayed there. If I ever had to go back to San Fran, I would stay again. (Let's hope I don't)!<//Text>

Based on our several trips there, our stay is always great; from the check in to the rooms and everything in between. Very comfortable beds and helpful staff.

Our food and beverage experience continues to be sub-par, however. We have had several breakfasts in The Garden Court and do not order the buffet. We are often left seeking out staff to fill our water, take our order, bring our check, etc. Bar service is also very slow. If you need to get somewhere quickly, I would eat breakfast elsewhere.

We love the Pied Piper's ambiance, but the service here is also less than I would expect for a hotel of this caliber. Often difficult to get the staff's attention, whether we are at the bar or seated for a casual meal. Once our server went on break and we had no one check on us until he got back, so we had to get our own drinks. Got the overall sense that the staff was just waiting for the clock to tick down so they could go home. I will go here again, but it will be for Maxfield Parrish, not the service.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

The hotel and staff is impressive from the first to the last interaction. Shea, the FD agent, greeted me and my husband that stayed at your hotel for my birthday. She congratulated me, was exceptionally nice and friendly and definitely deserves recognition. When we got to the room we had a pleasant surprise - a cake and personalized letter, that said Happy Birthday. The HK staff was nice as well. The tea experience was great. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!<//text>

This is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed at.  We stayed at your hotel last summer 2016 and our stay started off a little rough.  The manager did all his best to make things right and he did by offering us breakfast for our stay.  We ended up extending our stay for an additional 2 days and loved every minute of it.  Thank you for a memorable experience.<//text>

I travel 300 days a year for work and received some of the most dismissive and unhelpful service of any hotel. Communication between staff is horrible and basic needs like internet and clean rooms were a nearly impossible tasks to achieve. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money. A beautiful lobby is nothing with awful service.< /text>

Wonderful as always! We stay at The Palace every year at Christmas because it is beautiful and comfortable and the location is excellent. This year our room was even quieter and more cozy than ever, with a perfect mattress and bedding, a luxurious shower, and a good view. Everything was easy and the decorations, which change every year, were lovely. We love The Palace and will be back next holiday if not sooner!<//Review>

This is a gorgeous old hotel that I have frequented for years. It is truly grand. But, this time I was made to feel like a second class citizen. It seems something has changed. I have stayed here a great deal and even enjoyed the high tea during Christmas. Usually they give me a very generous upgrade to a larger room . They gave me an old junior suite that they just put a king bed in. Its not comfortable - its small - no coffee maker, you can hear the city, and the tv is at an angle that you have to crane your head to see. I called to ask for a bigger room and was told that SPG folks dont get those rooms. This isnt true - I have stayed in the penthouse here before. Truly sad. It was a day I really needed my loyalty to get me some pampering. This was my 25th night for the year and I have been an SPG for nine years.</review>

<text>Loved everything about this hotel from check in to check out. The hotel staff were very knowledgeable about the city and were able to provide many recommendations. The hotel does a great job of recognizing Platinum guests. This is definitely my go to hotel in San Fran.</text></record>

High-end hotel in the heart of San Francisco. Great property with luxurious, European feel. I have only good feedback on this property. From rooms to service—exceeds expectations. Would recommend.

Three aspects of this hotel I enjoy:

1) Location: Centrally located. Walking distance to most places in the SFO downtown area.

2) Rooms: I stayed in a suite and particularly liked the tall ceilings, nice furniture and the old-world style bathrooms with tile floors and pedestal sink.

3) Lobby: Great entry way into the hotel. Atrium was impressive.

For SPG elite members…

I’ve booked this property a couple of times on the weekends. I’ve been upgraded each time.<//Text>

Strike action and the consequent limit to normal experienced and qualified staff at the hotel marred what was to be a special experience of San Fran. 

Marriott hotel executives and management need to ensure that guests feel safe and proud to stay in their facility. Strongly recommend resolving employee matters quickly and respectfully. People do need to get paid a fair wage.<//review>

A tired Hotel.
AC too noisy so turned it off. Rooms dull and lacking in fresh air. Fridge buzzing all night so unplugged it.
Main reception area is beautiful.  So worth a visit and a drink at the bar.</Text>

The cream they served was not closed cream, which was disappointing for a $68 price point. This place did not allow us to split tea services. They were able to accommodate our gluten-free and egg-free party member, which was nice.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>The staff here was incredibly rude which negated any positive experience had otherwise. There was a very unfortunate experience that water started pouring through my bathroom light early in the morning. The engineers were very kind in trying to help it but the management and front desk staff were very rude and unwilling to be helpful.  I am very disappointed because were it not for their lack of professionalism, this would have been a fantastic stay. I will not fault the hotel for another customer flooding the bathroom above but I will fault them for having such terrible customer service in response to the situation.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmap_id><user_name>Morgan Breitmeyer< /user_name></record>

The front desk didn’t ask me to choose points or breakfast. I realized it when I was in the room, then I went to the front desk to change the points to breakfast. She said she thought that I wanted the pints. Amazing... Thr view of the room is only the wall and there is no upgrade for the room. The front desk told me that due to my check in on the app, the reserved the type of room I reserved. Later they changed another room for me. This is the first stay in SPG hotel after I got planium elite, this is not a very good experience. However, the hotel is definitely luxury.<//text>

<Review>Beautiful hotel. Great location for shopping and local transportation right outside the door. Staff was all very helpful and pleasant, often sending us off with extra bottled water. No free wifi even in the lobby seems a bit crazy in this day and age. Coffee in the lobby was great but would have loved a coffeemaker in the room. Overall a great stay and we will be back.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< user_id>

Although our room was not ready, the front desk staff really took care of us while we waited. Bell staff was quick for arrival and departure. The Pool is beautiful with clear glass ceiling.

The Palace Hotel was build before 1906 San Francisco earthquake. This an amazing classical building. The soaring ceilings in public area and hotel rooms create feeling of spacious freedom.r44
Lobby is decorated with beutiful flowers.h
The pool is indoors and a great place to relax, swim, and lounge. Nice hot tub.

The matress and pillows were comfortable. The bathroom had a tub.

We enjoyed breakfast in the breathtakingly beutiful dining room. The poppy seed lemon waffles were delightful.

Overnight valley parking is available for $72.

What I found disappointing was service. We arrived and one ballet was busy while another one was on his cell phone and  We came into a lobby and were greeted a by a long and slow check in line. It took a long time for management to add another person. The staff greeted us without an enthusiasm or simple smile. The same in the dining room and everywhere else. I wonder if staff is underpaid or there is some sort of dispute going on.

Honestly, I had better and more welcoming service in Sacramento Holiday Inn.</review>

<Rating>None<//Rating><review>We researched various hotels in San Francisco and chose The Palace. The location was perfect for our needs. Restaurants, museums, China Town, Fisherman's Wharf, Westfield Mall, etc., are all near or a short bus or taxi ride away. The hotel has a gorgeous area for drinks and dining. We took several pictures and enjoyed two breakfasts, after dinner snacks, and three evening cocktails during our week stay. The hotel manager, Sara S., went out of her way to accommodate us after security had to deal with an unruly guest in an adjacent room. Recommend asking for an interior room due to street noise. The final evening, someone set off a car alarm outside our window at 3:40 AM and after a minute the beeping stopped but then started again for another 20 seconds. The air conditioning was perfect and was needed since we hit a record high (106 degrees on Friday, 1 Sep). The room was clean and nice and the bed was comfortable. The shuttle returning us to the airport was quick (16 minutes). The concierges were very nice and helpful. Our daughter was pleased we came to visit and we will choose The Palace if we return before she returns to Georgia.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>The Palace is a beautiful hotel.  The only issue is that area of San Francisco has lots of homeless people and the City of San Francisco is doing a horrific job dealing with the homeless crisis.  We find ourselves going to Napa more frequently because the homeless crisis and the number of automobile thefts is outrageous.< /Review>< pictures>

Enjoyed our stay, front desk service is excellent, above and beyond my expectations. The garden court breakfast selection is mediocre. Must do pied piper which is highlight of our stay, food quality is superb, sitting situation can be improved if the connecting bigger room is designed same ambient as the smaller crowded bar area. Holiday decoration can be a bit more creative.< /text>

The pool was cloudy and the spa was filled with brownish foam. It wasn't inviting at all. The last day of our stay there was no hot water so we couldn't shower. Overall the hotel is really nice and a place I would definitely stay again if these items were fixed.</review>< time>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>I stayed my 728, 729, and 730th night at a starwood property at this "luxury collection" Palace Hotel in San Francisco . The check in agent thanked me profusely for my loyalty (lifetime Platinum status) and then told me I was upgraded and checked me into a room on the 3rd floor, next to the elevator banks, sharing a wall with the service elevator, overlooking interior rooms and a cracked glass dome of the lobby. Ironically, there was a book in the room heralding the great views at Luxury Collections hotel, which was a great relief since I had the worst view I've had in a hotel room all year and at least I could look at the book to see what views I should have got as one of the most loyal and valuable customer who has spent over a quarter million dollars at starwood properties. I dropped a quick note to @spgassist and I got a call from a manager. First, I was informed that I indeed had an upgrade since i had a larger bathroom (quick customer service tip: being told you have been upgraded from unacceptable to tolerable doesn't make things better). Also, they could move me to an exterior room (so why did they not give me this in the first place?), which I really did not have the time to do since I had unpacked. Would I like a bottle of wine or "something"? No - I do not drink wine and even if I did I don't think a $15 bottle of wine comes anywhere close to addressing my issues over a very expensive room. I wondered if anyone would make any further efforts to make amends during my remaining stay. No one did.

Here's my problem: this is the Luxury Collection and not a mid-level hotel. The minimum level of acceptable service is exceptional service at comparable competitive hotels. Their regular customers receive world class service. Imagine a customer who had spent over 700 nights with the group! If I were a manager looking at this, I would want to know why this room had been assigned to a Starwood Lifetime Platinum. Was it indifference, incompetence, or a systematic bias in how rooms are allocated? 

I do not recommend the hotel at all. If this is how they treat their most loyal and valuable customers, I can only imagine what it must be like for the infrequent traveler. I am considering cancelling about 5 reservations I have at SPG properties through mid-january based on how poor my experience has been. I will not be staying here when I return to San Francisco at the end of December.<//Text><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmapID>< name>

We couldn't have asked for a lovelier stay:
Our room was not only comfortable but beautifully appointed as well. Very clean. Excellent staff:
Bill, quite possibly the nicest man in the city, is friendly and courteous as he helps with our bags. (A wealth of S.F. information!) Lydia, at the pool, is always at the ready with an apple, bottle of water or plastic bag for my wet suit - God bless her, she even remembers my name and other details about me!
Do yourself a favor and stay at the Palace.</Review>

The hotel itself is beautiful and very comfortable. If nothing goes wrong, you will have a nice experience. However if something goes wrong, do not expect that hotel staff will be accommodating or kind in any way to resolve the issue. They are rude and have no inclination towards proper customer service.< /Review>

<Text>Enjoyed the old world elegance of this hotel. Check in was excellent, even though we could not get into room until 4 pm. which is their check in time. The room was a good size...360 square feet, with couch, 2 chairs, desk and very high ceilings.. Well appointed, very nice bathroom, great breakfast, long wait in drinks lounge, may not be enough wait staff and then our order was incorrect. Drinks good. Thought their dessert selections in lounge were terrible, could have gotten same at costco for few cents, although plate nicely decorated. cream puffs were pathetic, were not worth the $ 12.00 plus. Walked everywhere from the hotel, so for us well located. Near a BART for easy access from airport.</Text>< Pics>

This is a very historical place. The location is perfect. It's right by Market St and located near the Montgomery Street Bart station, so getting there is easy. If you choose to drive, they have a parking garage across the street and also offer valet. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the architecture is is gorgeous. It's on the expensive side, but definitely a nice place for a couple to stay.</Review>

My husband and I stayed here for part of our honeymoon. It is a gorgeous hotel! The staff if very friendly, the architecture is amazing. Very good drinks at the bar also. I would recommend staying here if you are in the area. Nice close walk to shopping and China town too.<//text>

<Text>The Palace Hotel is as grand and opulent as the name suggests. I feel like a celebrity every time I walk through reception. It's very well situated, with luxurious rooms and incredibly helpful staff. My room has an amazing view, huge TV and even a digital toilet! I've stayed in my fair share of hotels but this is easily the best I've had the pleasure of staying in!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Really could have loved this hotel, so charming and in a great location. However, came back from a back packing trip and staff was quite obviously biased to anyone who wasn’t dressed the way “they expected.”

Personally, I’m of the mindset that if you are truly embracing the SF culture, it seems a little silly to be upset just because we went hiking. A lot of people with money in the valley don’t dress in conventional ways, but that doesn’t mean you should treat them any lesser.

Overall, shoddy service for a gold Bonvoy Member.<//text>

This hotel is much better after the remodel a few years ago and it's very convenient to the financial district. I especially like that the BART stop is right outside the door.</Text>

I stayed at The Palace Hotel for 4 days.  The staff couldn’t have been more helpful!!  They made my daughters and I feel like royalty without seeming pretentious.  Doormen opened doors in perfectly pressed attire, yet would joke with you about anything if you wanted to and we’re always ready with directions.
Rooms were not spacious at all but ours had amazing shower and comfortable bed.
The main thing is that the lobby is the most beautiful space I have ever seen (and I have stayed in a lot of high end hotels).  The ceiling is made of glass.  The sitting area is full of leather chairs and palm trees.  More beautiful than I can describe.< /Text>

What a thrill to see the original maxfield Parrish "pied Piper" painting. In such osteer surroundings a real treat. The whole building is Mai rained in excellent taste. Impressive photo collections showing the prequake bones of the building. Oppulent surroundings for high tea or low whiskey! Look forward to stay here<//Text>

<review>This is a beautiful and historic old hotel with lots of charm. The amenities in the game such as the bed sheets and toiletries are outstanding. 

However the hotel is on strike right now and it is extremely inconvenient to get any food, beverage, or additional amenities.

I was so looking forward to a great start and it didn't.  I hope marriott, local hotel leaders  and the union come to an agreement to stop the erosion of this property's reputation.<//review><time>1539216000000</time>< Response>

This is my 2nd time visiting the Palace Hotel. Last year we stayed at executive suite. This time we stayed at junior suite. The rooms are well maintained but the cleaning is done extremely well. The staff is always friendly. Last time Ronald helped us above and beyond and made an impression. We decided to book again and we saw him. I don't think he remembered us but he again we above and beyond his ability to make us feel at home. He is the reason we keep coming back and also recommend the hotel. We will be back in September. Please give Ronald a raise! The guy is fantastic!</review>

I paid for a city view and my room supposed to come with breakfast for 2. First, they didn’t the city view (it was the view of someone’s balcony) , they also told they do not see it from their end that it comes with breakfast for 2. Basically I paid extra for NOTHING. horrible customer service and hotel staff didn’t even help me in any way.</text>

The entrance fee covered an open bar from 9pm-2am. There were multiple bars set up in each dance room to minimize lines. Overall it was a great time and I would come back for this event.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The Palace Hotel is absolutely beautiful. The exquisite architecture with detailed stained glass domed ceilings and beautiful marble columns and floors throughout, makes this hotel really breath-taking. There is a lot of history behind this hotel and it has been preserved quite well.

The swimming pool was a major selling point for us staying at this hotel. It too, has a glass-domed ceiling. How peaceful and relaxing!

The only thing I could find that this hotel is missing was, there were no dresser drawers to put your clothes in. All in all, just a minor detail.

I would highly recommend this hotel for any occasion. The location is ideal and the staff is great as well.< /Text>

Loved our stay here. Staff could not be more friendly and helpful. Obviously an older property, but updated and very clean. Beds comfortable. There is a chocolate shop on first floor and loved the smell of what seemed like fresh baked brownies as we walked to our room. When in SF again, will definitely stay here</review>

<Review>Hotel is really big and decor is on the more luxury, old fashioned side. It's definitely a nice hotel and service is good. The only thing weird is that my window faces an office building so in the morning it's uncomfortable not having the curtains cover the window. Wish there was a better way to let light through without it being so easy to see through... Not sure it's possible since the office building is so close< /Review>< Pics>

The hotel somehow lost our request for connecting rooms. They were fully booked during our stay and couldn’t fulfill our request so we had no choice but to have one person in one room and one parent with both kids in the other. The hotel doesn’t/would-not-answer to the repeated question about a room with 2 beds so we had to sleep with 3 people in a king.< /text>

Dripping in luxury and history - elegance from a bygone era perfectly preserved and updated. Richly appointed rooms - although the bathrooms could really be updated in all fairness. Helpful staff abound. The Concierges were incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. Aces all around - this is where I'll be staying for every future visit to SF</review>< rating>

I’ve stayed at the palace several times already and every time i go it’s consistently excellent service esp starting with the front desk, the manager Branden is very helpful and accommodating as well as his staff, can’t remember her name but she’s Filipino with short hair and is there during the Check in hours, she’s very pleasant and takes care of the guests needs. The rest of the staff from doorman to room service delivery person are always great to works with.< /text>

<Text>The Palace Hotel is a unique and beautiful San Francisco destination. It features a stunning lobby/atrium and recently renovated guest rooms. The staff provide impeccable service, going above and beyond to make your stay memorable. The hotel's location puts you in the heart of all that the city has to offer from restaurants to museums to landmarks. The only criticism we have is the odd choice of suit-case themed storage rather than standard cabinets in the room. Otherwise, a perfect stay for our 30th wedding anniversary.< /Text>< Resp>

This review covers only my high tea service. Tea selection was excellent as was the service and the gorgeous atrium. The accompanying sandwiches are very good but the weakest part of the experience. (Maybe more egg salad on the egg salad sandwich?) This might seem like such a small thing to quibble about, but this is one of the more expensive tea services in the city.<//Text>

Every time I walk into this hotel I feel like I have stepped back in time to the early 1900's (in a good way, not a worn out hotel way)! They recently completed a complete renovation and The Palace is now spectacular. I loved loved loved my room. Received a nice Platinum upgrade to a junior suite which was very nice. Plenty of room to stretch out and get work done as well as some more exercises. 

My absolute favorite thing at this hotel is the morning breakfast buffet in the Garden Court. The setting is incredible and the food is excellent. I am disappointed in their lunchtime offerings but the breakfast is unbeatable. The Pied Piper bar is also an excellent place to have a drink and take a meeting or two. 

I highly recommend this hotel.</text>

<Text>While I loved this hotel and the location was great, there were a few things that may prohibit me from staying at this hotel again. For one, there is no coffee maker in the room. So in order to have my morning coffee, I had to pay $20 for a cup to be delivered to my room. While the rooms were clean and fairly updated, there was a lot of ticking and crackling throughout the night. It was impossible to sleep. Food was average (room service) - nothing to rave about. The staff was friendly, quick to respond, and easy to deal with. The day we left, it took 30mins for valet to get our car. Frustrating departure. Overall, great hotel - just not a perfect experience.< /Text>< userid>

<Review>+ house keeping needs to up their service
- bath tubs are never clean. there is hair in the tub when you check-in to a new room
- cob webs found as well 
- over the last month of my stay here, house keeping always performed a haphazard job 

+ staff are rude
- staff are overall rude. 
- esp in-room dining staff are unbelievably rude. they cut you off when you are talking, force their scrip on you when you already gave them the info, and have a sassy attitude saying "that is what I just said" when you try to confirm your order. This has been encountered more than 3-4 times 

+ lobby is beautiful 
- the lobby and entrance is truly a charm 

+ room is dark and dim with a very uncomfortable desk 

wouldnt have stayed here for 4 weeks if it werent for the spg points<//Review>< user_id>

The hotel is a luxury hotel by all definitions -- this is evident upon arrival and confirmed upon staying more than 5 minutes in the building. However, what makes this hotel truly stand out is the attentiveness of staff. They went far and beyond the usual to accommodate me -- and I didn't think I had any special requests. The staff were hugely helpful when I needed to change rooms due to noisy families in my corridor -- the desk staff, Arturo, even came up to help me when the bell staff were busy. The servers, the bell service, the doormen -- all were fantastic: friendly, helpful, and sincerely wanting my stay to be memorable and smooth. I commend them for this -- thank you. It was a most wonderful stay.</Text>

AC won’t function properly- it was constantly spitting out cold air even though I raised the temperature target.   I ultimately had to have an engineer come up and assess the situation- and our only solution was to disable the thermostat all together. There was no way to properly maintain temperature and only way to turn off air was to disable the thermostat by removing the cover.  This... is obviously not convenient. 

This hotel is the classic example of having AMAZING staff, but property being subpar.</Review>

I came back a second time for a longer stay and the excitement kinda wane and the place doesn't really feel 4-star anymore. The place is still great for its location but there were a few mishaps this time. 

1. My first room has a Japanese style bidet toilet! 
2. The room has a switch by the door that does nothing. I think there was suppose to be a floor lamp (in my new room, the switch controls a floor lamp). 
2. There was also a used towel and robe >__<. I didn't found out till I came back late at night so didn't want to deal with it until morning. The desk in the room was also extremely dusty. Dirty towel and dusty desk makes me think no one has clean the place in a while.
3. When I went down to tell front desk in the morning, they offered to upgrade me to a different room. I had to head out so didn't get to see what they gave me. When I got back, I found that my upgrade room is now 2 floors lower. It is for sure bigger but not an upgrade for me. I am sensitive to noise and have specifically stated in my profile that I would like higher floor room to avoid street noise. This was also a connected room so even more noise. 
4. The toiletry is a big negative for me. There are lots of variety and great, but the shampoo, body wash, and lotion smells too much like perfume, a bit overpowering. 
5. Front desk seems a bit dismissive once you have check out. When I ask to leave luggage, they just point me to the Bell Desk on the far end, but there wasn't anyone at the Bell Desk at the time. 

----------------------------------
Previous stay was only for 1 night so didn't really experience the hotel more thoroughly.

A true 4-star hotel. Room is nice and staff are friendly.

Hotel is in a good location near transit and lots of food options.

1) Bini's kitchen: Nepalese dumpling aka momo
2) Asha's Tea house: good tea options 
3) Mazarine Coffee
4) Super Duper burger: cheddar garlic fries<//Review>

Came to the Palace for two nights of our honeymoon and the staff was exceptional. We were upgraded to a larger room and we had a 'congratulations' miniature cake waiting in our room. The rooms were very quiet and we never heard other guests through the walls. The hotel concierge arranged our dinner reservations in little Italy and we were in and out of the busiest restaurants within an hour. Overall this is an excellent place to stay.</review>

The breakfast buffet could use some enhancing and a little bit of more selections. A cook to order station will be very nice and the hours of operation for the weekend can be extended at least an hour more to give the guest more time to get down for breakfast. Parking fees way too expensive compared to NYC and DC.<//review>

Visit The Palace at least once a year for a work conference, and have stayed over night once. Great gem in downtown San Francisco. Easy, easy access to BART and muni which is a plus. Beautiful conference rooms, lobby and atrium area with high ceilings and nice natural light. Also, always the most beautiful flower arrangements in the lobby and doormen very courteous and helpful.<//Text>

During our recent stay we found that every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful. 
We had a car that required specific instructions for starting/driving and the valet was so reassuring that we felt more than comfortable leaving the car in his care. Every single staff member we encountered smiled and appeared eager to help. We plan on returning soon.< /text>

I stayed at Palace Hotel for two nights and loved the experience. They have a beautiful lobby with rooms that are simple but stilll feels luxurious. There is a gym and an indoor pool which is fairly small and can get loud with many kids around. All in all it's a great place next to many public transit stops and the ferry building.<//Review>

The Palace is a beautiful hotel with great rooms. Our room was immaculately clean and tidy. Luckily they were able to move me to a room with more daylight which made all the difference. Lots of restaurant choices and interesting ships nearby. I give your service an exceptional rating of 10 out of.<//Text>

Dear Palace Hotel,
We love the place and it shows as we book you more than any other hotel. Typically when we arrive we are immediately offered an upgrade based on our status and also informed about the possibility of late checkout. Janet did not mention either of these, and when I asked about them she seemed quite reluctant to make an offer. However, she did say that if I wanted to upgrade the room I would have to wait till 4pm. We looked at the room (which seemed smaller than the one we booked) and asked to have the new room. To our surprise, it was ready immediately. Which meant it had been ready all along, she had just hoped that we would not take the room. I am sure she is a capable staff member, but Janet needs to recognize that the personal service of a 5* hotel is what we SPG status members expect when staying. No one at The Palace had ever been so nonchalant about our arrival before. I hope they will not again.<//text>

I have stayed at 5 star hotels in the past and this hotel did not live up to other hotels. While the hotel is absolutely stunning, the customer service was subpar.<//text>

The Palace is in a great location. It is close to shopping and there is much foot traffic. The service is friendly and fast. This is a great place to come and grab drinks. It truly is beautiful. The pictures do not capture the beauty of this hotel. I did not stay here this time. But after spending some time in here, I just might stay here next time! Especially since the prices are competitive.< /Text>

This is my second stay at the Palace and the place where I intend to stay again next time I am in San Francisco. From the look and feel of the hotel to the comfort and quietness of the room, this is the perfect place to stay in the Financial District. The concierge service is outstanding and I highly recommend following their advice.< /text>

Palace Hotel in SF was a nice discovery for me. 
The interior is so beautiful, it feels like you are in real palace. :)

The Hotel has a very friendly professional personal, rooms are clean, pool and gym area specious and enjoyable. My husband and I love the location and overall pleasant stay in Palace Hotel. We are already talking about to stay again in the summer time at the Palace hotel. 

Thank you!< /Text>

Highly recommended hotel.  Beautiful lobby which is always welcoming when you're staying in a new place. Quality bar and food on-site.This is convenient if you just want to go downstairs or order in to your room.

Cleaning service was excellent as the rooms were spotless. They did a great job of turning over the room when we were away. Never had to call down because it was missed. Complimentary newspapers and shoes polish services were welcome. If we did need anyting service was usually very prompt.

Indoor pool and hot tub is a huge Plus. The gym also looks adequate for traveling needs.

Beds seemed stiff at first but ended up being one of the more comfortable mattresses we've experienced throughout our travels. Keep in mind we're very picky Tempur-Pedic users.

Plenty of amenities provided. Sheets and towels were of high quality.

They were even nice enough to provide some complimentary treats for a celebration.

Overall met expectations given price point.</text>

Beautiful building with fantastic features. Room was huge, clean and very comfortable. Concierge and door staff were excellent and more than helpful at every turn. Breakfast was again fantastic in choice, service and quality. Unfortunately dinner was a let down. The food was overcooked, poorly presented, slow and the waiting staff less than enthused
which came as a shock to my wife and I as everything else was so tastefully done. Would definitely have been 5stars only for that. Overall loved this beautiful hotel.</Review>

As my wife and I were enjoying the lovely buffet breakfast in the resplendent Garden Court at the Palace Hotel, we were each reminded of our favorite hotels in Rome or Vienna... How nice to find such a wonderful hotel in San Francisco!

We were delighted at the Platinum recognition...it has made our stay so very comfortable and elegant! As an architect, it is a treat to visit The Palace, and although we didn't see any of the refreshed rooms, our classically-detailed corner room overlooking Market Street was perfect for our family weekend in San Francisco.

Additionally, I have to say that the staff was universally friendly, solicitous, helpful and caring in a way that clearly goes beyond practiced professionalism...kudos!

The location is perfect and we we were able to walk everywhere: from Chinatown to the cable cars to the immediate neighborhood's high end shopping and restaurants. We also enjoyed dining at the Pied Piper grille (try the lamb shank shepherd's pie.)

We look forward to our next residency at the Palace!<//text>

Beautiful historic hotel, with pleasantly decorated rooms. Very clean with excellent service. The bathroom is rather on the small side and contains the only mirrors in the room, so it takes a while for two people to get ready. We had a Market Street view and enjoyed the large windows. This proved a bit noisy at night time with the cable cars and people shouting in the street but settled down after a while. Breakfast under the glass ceiling is a real treat, but we found the restaurant closed rather early for lunch so ate that elsewhere. The food is overpriced for what you get, but the hotel is in a great location for other restaurants.<//text>

Though the hotel was a beautiful place to stay and located very well. I was there for a conference and the billing was a real headache....we got the room before the actual conference registration was open and was assured that we would get the conference rate. A few days before the conference when we called to check on the amount we were told that we needed to go directly through the conference website, yet no one every let us know so no rooms were available by then. When checking out of the hotel Jim had to put it on his personal credit card because the hotel said they never got a cc authorization, yet the authorization was sent almost 2 month prior! Good thing he had a credit card, I am so embarrassed to have put him at this hotel and will be buying a nice bottle of wine to ask for forgiveness!!<//Text>

From the warm and welcoming greeters at the elegant entrance,  it felt inviting.   Bill,  our bellman was most helpful along with a really engaged and professional housekeeping staff.   Truly the Grande Dame of The City, The Palace succeeds by doing all the little things right.</review>< Rate>

Full Disclosure: I am an SPG Platinum and was able to use some Suite Nite Awards for an upgrade to a suite on my stay. This of course impacted some of my view of this property.

This is a stunningly beautiful hotel right in the heart of San Francisco. The beauty does not only extend to the lobby, but also the staircases and hallways throughout the property. My room was well appointed, and as a suite, had a living room with couch and multiple comfortable chairs.

While the property maintains its history in beautiful fashion, the HVAC system and bathroom fixtures are very modern. No issues with having the ability to control the temperatures, and no plumbing issues with scalding or freezing water.

I took advantage of the complimentary overnight shoe shine service and had my freshly polished shoes back at 7:00am, in plenty of time to start my day.

The staff that I interacted with at reception, restaurant, housekeeping, and turndown service were all professional and pleasant. 

I would consider this a true signature SPG property in San Francisco, and would recommend it without reservation.</review>

A friend who grew up in SF recommended this hotel and I am so glad she did. The ambience was elegant and historical but it was extremely comfortable at the same time. Concierge staff was SO helpful - I loved all of their recommendations. The breakfast is pricey but I am so happy I tried it once for the experience - there are a wide range of options on the buffet. The hotel is near public transportation which was extremely helpful to get to UCSF and Golden Gate Park. It was a comfortable walk to Fisherman's Wharf. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to everyone!</Review>

Food was amazing but the service was less than expected.  Staff was generally unattentive, did not check in regularly to see if we needed anything and slow to provide refills.   Had it not been for the amazing atmosphere, food and architecture, I would have rated this as a 2 or 3 star experience.<//Text>

<Review>We loved everything about our 13 day stay at The Palace. From the moment we arrived, Paul greeted us at the door. He is charming and warm and welcoming. The registration staff were amazing and gave us the perfect room for our vacation. We met Casey who also extended a warm welcome and offered to help us in any way. The bellmen were courteous every moment. Debbie and Blaine were superb as well as all your concierge staff. Thank you to all. Housekeeping as well !!!

Great place, clean room, quick service and cleaning, haven't tried room service.... The Ghiaredelli Store downstairs fills the entire building with an amazing chocolatey smell , very friendly staff in lobby offering to carry luggage, etc. Great experience, worth the price, nice gym and pool! Starbucks right down the street too so always a plus 😅< /review>

<Text>The hotel itself is historically beautiful, the staff is extremely accommodating (particularly the housekeepers), and my stay was great overall. But the location and the thin walls/windows keeps me from giving this hotel a 5/5. I understand the homeless issue is a problem all over SF, but this specific area seemed excessive in particular. There were times we'd walk out of the hotel and it seemed homeless would completely surround the block around the hotel, and with the amount we paid to stay here, I would think this could at least be somewhat controlled. I realize now that SOMA (South of Market) is a particularly dense area for homeless, but for those who don't know beforehand it should be known it is not an exaggeration and might be one of the worst in the city. Only other issue was the thin walls/windows. From your room, you can hear a majority of the noise and conversation in rooms adjacent to yours, you can hear everything going on in the hallways, and you can hear everything outside in the streets below regardless of the floor you're on (we stayed on the 8th of 9 floors).< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Every time I travel to San Fran, I try to stay here. The staff is friendly and always goes above and beyond.  The rooms are comfortable and updated.  Depending on the location of your room, it can be noisy, but that's to be expected with the BART right outside of the hotel.</text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>None<//rate><Review>We stayed at this hotel traveling into SF on business and had a few days extra so we booked the Palace and used an upgrade so we were in a suite. The room was very nice, large, high ceilings and had a historic feel to it. That being said I think you could keep some of the "historic" and do some nice modern updates. The bathroom was very small, tiny tub (at least put in the arc bars like they have at the Westin so you can pretend you are in a bigger bath) The Hotel itself is quite remarkable you should take a walk around. Its very conveniently located as well to some amazing restaurants. As I put its worth at least one stay, we will probably pick a little more modern feel in the future but I was happy we stayed here at least once.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>First let me say that the hotel is beautiful and in a great location (just above a BART station for great ease in getting to/from the airport). Upon check in we were greeted by a very cheerful front desk agent named Morey! He was great, listened to our needs, provided the best service I have even received and genuinely seemed to care about us. The other staff we encountered were just as nice, always smiling and asking if we needed anything. For fitness buffs the hotel has a pool and fitness facility (rare), although we did not have a chance to use it. We can't wait to go back!< /text>< Pictures>

The Palace is a beautiful hotel, but that is the only attribute of the property. As someone who stays at many luxury hotels (SPG and others), I can say the service level at The Palace is among the worst I have experienced. Simply put, its wildly apathetic and always rooted in how they can't help you. Starting from before we even arrived at the hotel, I put several calls into both the concierge and front desk to get recommendations for wine tasting and secure reservations for my anniversary. Neither returned any phone calls. As a result of no one ever calling me back from the front desk, my early check-in was not on record and the front desk clerk told me I would not have access to my room until 6pm. While I understand, early check-ins can't always be met, I do expect my room to be ready at the correct time. At which point, the desk agent told me I could have lunch in your lobby. Of course, the lobby actually doesn't serve lunch after 2pm.. but why would your front desk person know these things. At which point, I tweeted starwood a complaint as I have a large twitter following. Once this happened, finally your on duty manager from your property actually called me back. The fact that I had to use social media to even connect with someone at your hotel says volumes. Once we finally got into the room, little things are just off. The mini-bar was never re-stocked, the walls were all scuffed up with black marks. Anytime, we had any questions for bell service or concierge, everyone seemed very bothered and offered very little help. Additionally, my partners name was never added to the room by your staff and he was left stranded for an hour with no access to the room. Overall, it put a very bad taste in my mouth and took a lot of fun out of my anniversary weekend. To add insult to injury, the bottle of champagne they sent up as a gift was actually charged to my card and still hasn't been taken off< /text>

<Review>This is the hotel that delivers everything a serious business traveler has on the list of wants and needs. It does this with character and unique surroundings you can't find elsewhere.
Above all, the staff cares about you, learns your needs and always does their best to meet them.
The rooms are comfortable, especially the beds. Have been upgraded often.
Try the killer palace crab omelette in the morning and try one of the best sushi ya this side of the pacific.
Stay over a weekend and enjoy the brunch, some decompress time in the Garden Court.<//Review>< resp>

<Text>My and a close friend's family went there for thanksgiving, 4 adults/3 kids.

We had two incidents in one day. 1) My daughter cut her foot in swimming pool. We still did not know what caused the accident when left the hotel. 2) My friend's 4 year old was left in the elevator since it was old and closed really fast.

Other negative observations:
- !!!!! NO LOCK IN THE BATHROOMS !!!!!! Really inconvenient when your friend's kids were in the room.

- Some protest happening outside of hotel for two months, really noisy and even in the rainy thanksgiving night.

Positive observations:
- Staff were well trained and they were polite, patient, and showed care to kids in the two incidents above.</Text>< Date>

<review>I recently stayed at The Palace Hotel with my fiance for a weekend getaway. The lobby and exterior of the hotel were excellent. When we entered our room the light switch did not turn on the lamp, which was not a big deal however, we were excited to see our room for the first time. We then had to shuffle our way through the dark to find the light switch. Also, there were many markings on the wall that should have been painted over or cleaned. The trash can and tv console were noticeably chipped and needed to be replaced. In addition, under the glass on the nightstand was extremely dusty. Don't add glass if it cannot be maintained properly. I was disappointed primarily because the rest of the hotel was extravagant. I assumed that the rooms weren't as important or either I should have paid more for a better suite (which should not have been the case). I can say the bathroom was the best part of our stay. It was beautiful. The staff was also excellent.< /review><rate>None<//rate>< pictures>

<text>The Palace is beautiful. It's got a great art deco style, and great service. The food is lovely, but for sure the high tea is overpriced for the amount of food you get. The furniture style is also very jarring... it's very modern in comparison with the architecture. If they were trying for "fancy anachronistic" they definitely didn't hit the mark.<//text><Rating>3< /Rating>< username>

Arriving in the lobby after a very delayed flight, I had high expectations for the room. With my SPG gold status, I was “upgraded”to a deluxe room. When I arrived in the room, it was clear the rug had not been vacuumed-food scraps were next to the bed-YUCK! I called the front desk, which sent housekeeping instead of just switching me.

The next morning I opened the curtains to look directly over at another side of the hotel!This is deluxe!!???? I visited the front desk to inquire about a room with at least a bit of sunlight. Apparently this hotel believes sunshine is a premium amenity-but I was moved. Be careful to request sunshine in your reservation request if you don’t want to look at a brick monolith outside of your window!

Beds are marginally comfortable-but definitely not as good as other 5* hotels I have stayed in.

On a positive note, in addition to the gorgeous public spaces, the staff, concierge, and housekeeping were fantastic!<//text>

The most beautiful dining area in the city is just off the lobby with a great breakfast buffet. The intimate restaurant dining room is also beautiful. Morey at the front desk was super welcoming as was the Door Man who shared city tips while we waited for a morning tour bus. Bell Service was helpful as was Concierge. The whole staff genuinely wanted to make your stay special. Meeting elements seemed to run smoothly. Guest rooms are small as is typical with historical hotels but room was clean and bath modernized and everything worked.<//review>< Pics>

Offer was made to move to another room, but we decided not too. It was only an issue a couple days when hot. Also, the tile grout in the shower needs cleaning, there was black mold started in a few spots.

I did not get recognition of being an SRG member. That was set for the second week, but we added a first week due to the wine country fires. I didn’t realize until checkout my stay was credited to AAA membership. I would like to get that changed and the resulting free WiFi.

Last, every single person working there made us feel we were very welcome. We love staying at the Palace due to the staff, and location and rooms.<//review><user_id>None< /user_id><Pics>None</Pics><time>1509062400000</time></record>

I simply love this hotel, very grand and the rooms were and always have been lovely.

First off, please do NOT DEMAND to be upgraded to a suite for being a platinum member. Just kindly request for one upon check-in. I was originally ugraded to a grand deluxe (even my original booking was a classic room). Simply and politely requested for a suite, and they happily upgraded me to a superior suite.

I have never stayed in a non-suite room so I cannot comment on what it looks like. But once again, I always pay the cheapest rate/room and have been upgraded to suite everytime I stay at the Palace Hotel - The suites are indeed posh.

However, I do have to agree with other reviewers that the bathroom is quite old looking - that's the only negative part about the room.

A negative aspect to this hotel is that their business centre is a 3rd party facility and thus, requires you to swipe your credit card in their machine (for printing purposes, etc).

Other than that, lovely hotel, lovely staffs. Never stayed in a different starwood property in SF as my first time there (2008) was great. so why try something else right?

I questioned that and told it was due to need to remove feather pillows due to my mild allergy. I said I’ll take any room and they gave me a room on three. The hallways on my hat floor looked like a scene from the shining with chairs and tables in halls. I entered room and went to sleep but then stopped me staff member tried to enter my room with no knock. Fortunately security device was latched.

<text>This old, classic hotel is absolutely beautiful. The room was spacious, as was the bathroom. Location is in walking distance of anything one would need in San Francisco. We caught a great through AARP (which was also available through AAA) that included parking and made this, from what I could research, the best deal in town. Hotel personnel were ALL amazingly friendly and courteous. We had nor prior knowledge of the hotel, and we were really happy with our stay.</text>< Response>

Our son arrived on a late flight. Thankfully there was late night room service for him so he did not have to go searching for food. The rooms blended period appointments with modern convenience. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast in the beautiful restaurant. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a French Chateau. Our server gave us some great recommendations for things to do. We had reservations for dinner that night in the city. We asked the Bellman for a cab and he recommended taking the hotels “limo” rather then two cabs to fit everyone.

Stopped by for a late afternoon rest at their bar/restaurant.  Ordered a mix of coffee and wine.  Portions are generous.

Typical luxury hotel experience. Friendly service in a very nice and grand area.  Elegant classic design for a certain type of crowd. Not exactly modern.

No reason to visit, but if you're looking for somewhere to put your feet up after shopping for a day, it's a good (but pricey) option.</Text>

Interior was very lovely to look at and relaxing if you take the stairs up to the second floor. The seats at the social event was very comfortable as they also provided delicious foods and treats.</text>< pictures>

I would give it 3.5, but rounded up to 4. The location is great, but the reason I won't stay here again is due to the noise, at least in the room where I stayed. Noise from the bell staff calling for taxis. Noise from the other rooms. Noise from the hall.

While there are great things about old buildings, I think the problems can outweigh the charm.

I think they've done a nice job freshening the rooms. I especially love the Grohe fixtures in the bathroom with the rain shower. Very tastefully done, but not my preferred type of design.

I think the best part of the hotel is the Garden Court, which is magnificent. The classic design and amazing ceiling makes you feel like you're in Europe.

The service is also quite excellent.

Overall, it's a very nice hotel, but the fatal flaw for me is the noise.</review>

My hypothesis is that the hotel was designed by men for men. A quick (utterly unscientific) poll of my friends yielded men that were ok working from their suitcase and women who like to unpack. I am firmly in the latter group. It made me angry and ruined my stay.</Text>< user_id>

<Review>I will definitely stay here again. I love the old glamour and history of older hotels. It was very relaxing to sit at the Garden Court for cocktails and snacks. We also spent two nights at the Pied Piper. I watched the little blurb on the Starwood channel re: the painting and was enchanted.

Only cons: maids knocked almost every hour to see if we were out of our room each day. Secondly, my credit card was charged a security deposit everyday [totalling $460 for a 3 night stay]. I've never heard of that worrisome practice before.</Review>< Time>

My 10 year old daughter and I checked into this hotel the day prior to a scheduled SF Ballet performance. Having "sampled" surrounding competitive hotels for each ballet the past 2 seasons, this definitely is a contender for our favorite! The charm and history crowned this as a "special" hotel, and the wonderful pool (5+ star hotel employee managing fitness area and pool!) and spa made us feel incredibly pampered. In addition, location is perfect and in very safe neighborhood close to wonderful restaurants, shopping, museums, etc.
We will return!</Text>

The location is great. Close to Pier one at the ferry building and lots of public transportation. Quik walk to the metreon and the San Francisco Mall. Rooms are spacious and well-appointed, staff is friendly. The gym is on the smaller side but all the necessary equipment for a good workout. The pool is heated and the hot tub is extra so it's great after a long day of walking around the city. Wonderful experience so far thank you he would definitely recommend to stay here again.</review>

This hotel is a gorgeous national treasure. The rooms and hallways truly feel like you are a guest of royalty in a palace, especially because of the very high ceilings. Rooms are spacious and beds are extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, the hotel rooms could use some maintenance--the bathrooms seemed dated and not in their best shape and the furniture in the rooms, with the exception of the bed and beautiful lamps, could use replacement. The sound-proofing in the walls was rather poor. SPG recognition was non-existent until I pointed out my status, at which time the attitude changed. With some tweaks and refurbishments, this could be one of my favorite SPG hotels.< /review>

4th floor room was comfortable, however needs a little updating and understand the upper floors are perhaps more updated. Staff were all fantastic, very friendly and wanting to assist. Room air conditioning was a little noisy and we had to turn off at night as too noisy if on anything other than lowest setting. Rated food a good, however would say breakfast was expensive and average at best however room service and conference dinner and lunches were good. On request we were provided with tea and coffee making facilities in the room, which was great.<//review>

Stayed a couple of times. Staff are great. Rooms (standard) are good, maybe a little compact but that is in line with the age of the building. They are pleasant and we'll appointed nonetheless. What makes this place excellent is the rest of the building.  The atrium is jaw dropping. The Pied Piper bar great too. I will no doubt return</text>

<Text>I stay at the Palace several times a year but was pleasantly surprised when I checked in. The lobby and entranced looked the same but as soon as I got off the elevator onto my floor I immediately noticed everything was new. The paint is a cool grey and the carpeting is modern and classy and all of the hallway lighting is new. As I opened the door to my room I was amazed that 99% of room was new, including the bathroom.

The décor is updated, bed, fixtures, carpeting, bathroom vanity and tile, shower, etc. I felt so comfortable and at home. Great job Palace! The only negatives were that the TV was on the very small (old) desk so there wasn't much room to work and it was very difficult to watch TV if you were also working at the desk. There are no outlets on top of the desk, only a power strip under the desk so hopefully all of your items have long cords. Although the bathroom was completely renovated, I was sad to see that a rainfall shower head was installed. I loved the showers here because of the high water pressure but now that has slowed to a rain (trickle).

Overall, I would recommend this hotel because of the vast improvements and look forward to seeing the rest of the public areas once they are complete.</Text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Planned a special weekend in SF for two couples, eager to be in a nice hotel with Platinum benefits. However, I was constantly having to return to front desk (and wait) for information or to correct simple things that should be seamless. Rooms were not ready at checkin. We were told (after pre-registering) to just come to the side of the desk to get our keys (and not stand in line). When we returned, I waited at the side for 15 minutes while all customers in line were served first (including two that arrived after I did - note to self, just get in line). Then only one room was ready, so it was not until 4 pm when we got to our room. We weren't given coupons for the Platinum Breakfast (not at checkin or when I returned to desk that night to inquire about how it works, times and place). When we arrived at restaurant, I had to return to the front desk and wait as the front desk reconfirmed my status and unsuccessfully looked for the notes that we had two platinum members so could invite 2 guests to breakfast. After 15 minutes, I could return to my guests in the restaurant lobby and go to breakfast. Our late check-out did not prevent our keys from being shut off at 1:30 pm, meaning I waited for 10-15 minutes outside of my room still wet from the pool as security came up to let me in. I was then told I needed to return to the front desk if I wanted new keys. We called down to ask for new keys to be brought up, but the front desk transferred us to security - no answer and sent to voicemail. We decided to give up and just check out. The breakfast buffet was of very good quality. However, please note that even with a breakfast coupon you will automatically receive a bill for a full buffet upcharge of $7/person plus tax and gratuity. The coupons indicate "complimentary continental breakfast" but there are no signs with prices, or indication as to what items (or sections are included or not included). Not a huge deal, but one guest didn't choose any hot items, so I was able to get the bill adjusted. A better system is needed.<//Review>

We had the good fortune to stay at The Palace during two consecutive weeks -- it only got better. Both times we were upgraded to a lovely room; the second time Taka had ensured a great room for early check-in before we had arrived -- that's great service! Scott provided the perfect check-out.

We love the grand hallways, the solid construction and comfort of the rooms, and extraordinary staff. The pool and jacuzzi are a nice plus -- but it's time to have a true spa at a hotel of this caliber.

One quibble -- the cost for parking is $59 -- luckily we know local lots for half that but we missed the convenience of having our car taken care of for us. (I'm not sure if these astronomical fees are much different for other downtown SF hotels, however.) Just be aware if you go that route. Thank you for two fabulous stays.< /text>

<review>I have always enjoyed the elegant charm and grandeur of this iconic hotel having stayed here on at least 30 occasions over the years. The Palace Hotel holds a central location that works well for business, special occasions, and for amazing get-away weekends. The Palace has recently undergone an impressive transformation. Not only have the rooms, corridors, and Garden Court been beautifully refurbished, but there is a marked enhancement of the staff's pride for being here and helpfulness to their guests.</review>< Pictures>

The non profit I work for, Swords to Plowshares had our 21st annual Veterans Day dinner fundraiser here this evening. An historical landmark with an interior best described as elegant with marble walls & columns and original large glass chandeliers adorning the ceiling of the lobby, hallways, ballrooms, and restaurant. A wonderful evening was had by all.<//review>

The Palace - A jewel sitting amongst a number of very good to excellent Starwood properties (I have stayed at them all at least once). I seem to return most frequently to The Palace (yes I do like the name).
Why you might ask? There is a list of reasons...
First of all they do have good rates for a hotel of it's class.
The entry way is beautiful. providing a sense that one has arrived.; parking fees are a little steep, but that is true for San Francisco at large. If you do choose to valet you will be greeted by prompt, helpful, and friendly valets.
The staff have always been friendly and professional. I have always felt welcomed. Gerrard with his distinguished sense of French style, told me with a genuine smile that I had been upgraded to a beautiful suite last time I stayed. Indeed it was, a marble bathroom with a jetted tub and separate shower; a very comfortable bed; and a lovely living room with an original chandelier so beautiful I wish I could have shrunk it and taken it home with me... I like that the furniture, it is functional and antique (I like antiques , they provide a timelessness that is relaxing). Even the most basic rooms I have stayed in have had a sense of simple elegance - comfortable. However, being Platinum I have usually been upgraded.
The Pied Piper bar in the lobby caters to locals and guests alike, in fact on a Friday it can be quite crowded which is good if you like people watching and making new friends. They make very good cocktails and they do have a few hotel exclusives. They also serve food in the bar, but you may prefer to venture out to one of the city's great restaurants. Breakfast is served in the Palace room with the original stained glass ceiling you must see while you are here, a true work of beauty. As is the pool area, which has a large glass ceiling, hot tub, and dry sauna; I always make time for taking a swim at The Palace. The hotel is centrally located... close to shopping, Market cafes on the Bay, museums and... What do you want to experience on your visit to San Francisco? I am sure you can find it close by if not at the Palace.< /review>

It started off great with Morey at the front desk graciously making these "country mice" feel VERY special as he helped with rearranging our reservations to meet our needs and then sending some refreshments to our rooms! Thanks again Morey! The pool was great as were all of our rooms. We couldn't afford to eat in the beautiful restaurant but hope some day to return and be able to try it out. The morning coffee was good, though!< /text>< pics>

I would not recommend this hotel in any aspect.  They had protestors out front that prevented us from entering our room.  Also, sounded like a circus came rolling through our room at 7 am.  Many amenities were not functional (room service, etc) due to this protest.  WE were NEVER warned that this was happening.  The WORST experience I have ever had from a supposed "5-Star" hotel.  I would give the place Negative 1-star.<//Text>

<Review>I stayed here in February and they were mid-remodel and I happened to stay in a newly remodeled room (I thought) but with an old desk and TV. The response to my review was that the new furniture would be in soon for the desk/TV.

Well that new desk/TV combination makes a huge difference. The TV is now mounted and the desk is clutter free and available as a work area for my computer. They also have new outlets in the furniture so that was also much better.

The beds here are so comfortable I don't want to leave them and they still have all of the 5 star amenities in the bathroom, including luxury robe and amazing towels, that I expect from a 5 star hotel.

Great job Palace Hotel!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Really lovely place with an amazing location, about a 7 minute walk from the Ferry Building. The AC fan in the room, and also the mini-fridge, however each made some intrusive sounds overnight. That said, an exceedingly helpful staff here, who helped us stow our bags late into the afternoon on our departure day.<//Review>

I stayed at the Palace because it was supposed to be a part of the conference that I was attending. At the last minute the conference pulled out because of the strike and decided to have events elsewhere. Overall my stay was nice, the room was clean, and the staff did all they could to control the noise from the protestors. I would definitely try the hotel again when there isn’t a strike going on.< /Text>

We now are loyal to the Palace because we took the free City tour. It takes 90 minutes and we enjoyed the history and the gossip about the previous owners and the life of the Palace.
Our room was upgraded and this is the most recognition we have received at any hotel for being a Starwood member. The concierge were knowledgeable and directed us to great restaurants and gave us a lot to do in 2 days. , The location was wonderful. We used the trolly for transportation.<//Review>

<Rating>None< /Rating><review>From the moment you arrive at the Palace Hotel and are greated by the gentlemen at the Porte-cochere and the Bell Men who assist with your luggage, you know you are starting your stay at the Historical Palace Hotel to be a wonderful experiance.
The front desk staff, very professional and most courtious, if you are a return guest you are welcomed with your last name and asked if there is anything the hotel staff can do for you.
The facilicity is gracious with the beautiful Garden Court and the Pied Piper lounge. The rooms are large with high ceilings. The indoor pool is most relaxing, just what is needed after a long day of travel. From maticulous house keeping to in room dining, one couldn't ask for more. If you want to step back in time, join the Garaden Court for brunch or high tea on Sunday. For cocktails, view the Maxfield Parish painting behind the bar, a true historical treasure, not to mention the gentlemen behind the bar serving up what every your heart desires. Louge dining is most enjoyable with a great menu for just a snak or full on dining experience.
Last but not least the ladies and gentlemen at the Concerige desk are a treasure of knowledge, and can assist you with tours, transportation, theatre tickets, dining reservations, shopping, shipping, boarding passes, and much more. They are my go to at the hotel.
A frequent return guest.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>As a Starwood Lifetime Platinum member this stay disappointed at every turn. Room 410 is dark and dreary and faces an alley. I requested an in room coffee maker and it was broken, not what you want to realise at 5:30 in the morning. The Front sesk staff was indifferent and as loyal repeat guest, not one of my room requests was arranged for this stay. There was no wlecome note or attempt to find a nicer room option and I was offered a lesser option and finally gave in, as nice as the common rooms are and the beautiful decor the room was mediocre at best and that is ultimately the success of a stay, this was a business trip and a little effort from the hotel staff could have made a world of difference.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>The service here is world class. Every staff member greets you with a smile and a warm greeting, morning, afternoon or(late) at night.  Nothing compares to the experience, even the small things they do make a world of a difference!  I check in, leave my room for some dinner, I come back to my
room tidied up, slippers next to the bed with a couple of chocolates!< /text>< UserId.>

<Rating>None</Rating><Text>If you want an historic San Francisco hotel experience the Palace fits the bill. Huge public spaces are adorned with beautiful wood, soaring ceilings and fresh flowers. It's worth stopping in just to see the goregeous stained glass atrium in the Garden Court. The rooms and beds are very comfortable. Front desk staff is always great, and special requests handled easily. This is one of the few SF hotels with a swimming pool and a beautiful one at that. It's also in a great location on Market Street, close to shopping, restaurants and the waterfront. For those using public transportation, a BART/Muni station is right outside the door.</Text>< Pics>

I was simply amazed by how awesome the staff were! I Got there at about 11:30am, well before the 3pm check in, but they still had a room ready for me (On a Friday too). After a long day of walking 10 miles across San Fran, I took an uber home, but forgot my phone in the car. I couldn't call it because the battery was dead. The staff here did everything they could to try and contact uber and help me find how to contact the driver! It was so nice because the issue had nothing to do with them at all. I was able to get ahold of the driver who brought my phone about 90mins later, but during that time of me waiting outside, the staff had nice conversations with me and even gave me 2 free drink vouchers to make up for my stress. They were very empathetic and all awesome. If for no other reason than this, I'll gladly stay here anytime I'm in San Fran! The room was nice and quiet too, but I wasn't in the room much since it was my only day in San Fran. Also the lounge area is BEAUTIFUL!< /review>

The palace hotel truly lives up to its namesake. That all starts with the staff which were top notch to say the least. I loved the high ceilings throughout the hotel, in the room itself I'd estimate then at 12 ft. The bathroom isn't huge but, sufficient. It's not the best shower combo, but having the rain faucet and a wand helps make up for that. Breakfast, under the atrium, is well worth it. The wait staff was attentive and the views is stunning. There is an excellent spread of traditional options along with a great assortment of fresh fruit, cheeses, pastries, smoked salmon, etc. If you're offered to include breakfast in your booking it's $38 on site, but bookable online $40 for two. Unfortunately We did not get the chance to check out the pool, but given everything else here I'd expect it to give a sense of refined luxury. San Francisco has so many great options to choose from at these price points and the Palace is good value here.</text>

The hotel staff was amazing, and the hotel itself is beautiful. The event staff that we worked with were a professional group of individuals that kept our meeting running smoothly. We received plenty of compliments for the venue choice. 
As for my personal experience, my room had a leak the morning. I was moved right away to another room and received a handwritten letter of apology and received some complimentary treats. It was very considerate, and when I come back to San Francisco again for a personal visit, I'll make sure to visit this hotel again. Thank you again for the hospitality and professionalism!<//review>

<review>This is a beautiful hotel. The demeanor and service of all the staff was excellent. We especially loved the pool and location of the hotel. The pool kept us moving even while the rain came down outside. The location of the hotel near the Bart and the Ferry building allowed us to get around and enjoy the great food that San Francisco has to offer. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to San Francisco.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Beautiful, classic opulence in excellent condition (unlike many gilded hotels, which can be a little rough around the edges when you look closely). High ceilings, chandeliers galore, gold details, intricate plaster, and a generally stunning hotel. Also, the breakfast was exceptional - the best eggs bennedict I have ever eaten.< /Text>

<Rate>None< /Rate><Review>I recently enjoyed a 5 night stay at The Palace. Clearly the hotel facility is a beautifully renovated historic hotel but it is the level of service provided by the staff which is most remarkable. Over the duration of my stay there were a handful of staff members who remembered my name throughout and went out of their way to see to it I had everything I needed. As an example, the housekeeping attendants had just finished cleaning my room one afternoon when I returned and there had been some wine glasses in the room. Five minutes later a room service attendant arrived with two fresh glasses. This is but one example of how they anticipated my needs.
I highly recommend The Palace.<//Review>< user>

Fantastic! Hotel staff and replacement staff wonderful caring hardworking. Very clean. Food excellent even for a limitef menu.  Will definitely return. Best pool for working out if you are a swimmer. Great work room and staff.  If you come to stay while the protestors are still being rude and loud. Try to ignore them.  Highly recommend!</text>

My Wife and I recently stayed at your Hotel as a Starhot guest through our Daughter. We had Friday meetings to attend, and Saturday fun, but enough about us! Your staff at the Palace Hotel are World Class bar none. We have stayed at many Hotels in the San Francisco area and you are up there with the very best! Your facilities are perfect, from the rooms, to the dining, and once again staff. Keep up the good work, and YES we will be back.

Thanks</text>

Breakfast in the Garden Court is the epitome of perfect relaxing luxuriation. Food was excellent for buffet style, service wonderful. Ambience out of this world.< /review>
</record></dataset><record>
<text>I have rarely enjoyed a short stay so much as at the Palace Hotel...the great features: large rooms, central location, and Old World feel, plus the matchless Garden Court, remain. The staff are superb: Alan at the parking garage and Krista at the front desk in particular made me feel at home. And the fitness center has been upgraded and now are at the high level of the rest of the hotel. Just a few odd glitches: no bathrobe in the room, lumpy and uncomfortable pillows, and no laundry bags-- didn't disrupt my stay much (except for the pillows) but were strange lapses in such a beautiful and well-run hotel</text>< user_id>

Came here for tea. The ambiance of the garden court is fantastic, however, the service quality is quite poor for afternoon tea. We were neglected the entire time - no one brought us water, or help take away used dishes.</Text>

<Review>The hotel was magical. I loved every minute of my stay here. Everyone was so attentive and kind. The staff all had smiles on their face and gave a warm welcome. The hotel is beautiful and is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The bed was so comfortable that I fell right asleep after a long day of being a tourist. The proximity of the hotel is perfect. I will for sure be back to this gem of a hotel.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We recently stayed at this hotel on our first trip to San Francisco. I must say this Hotel was Fantastic. Beautiful classic structures, lobby with Outstanding breakfast options, wonderful and welcoming staff, perfect location. I was very happy to be greeted by a very well festive decorated front entrance, not to forget the valet and attentive bell desk staff. Our room had a great view and the layout was nice, bed super comfortable, restroom was very clean and contemporary. House keeping very attentive and accommodating, Noise, well if you already have stayed at a hotel before which I have almost all around the world, you shall understand that noise will be heard unless you stay at a private villa of course.  Thank you and I will definitely stay at this location again.</Review>< Pics>

The Palace is a beautiful building - there's real wow factor when you walk in. Also, the location is perfect - right next to a BART stop and close to a lot of things in SF. Our room was on the 7th floor and was lovely - looked like one of the recently renovated ones. But there are definitely quite a few things that could use improvement. First of all - at check-in there's a special line for SPG gold/platinum members, but it wasn't open when I arrived. I had to wait a really long time to check in. Not the end of the world, but if you're going to have that as a benefit, it should be open when guests arrive. I had put in my reservation my arrival time. In fact we really didn’t get any SPG recogtion at all despite being SPG Gold. Secondly, we didn't get a turn down service. I saw online that the hotel offered it and usually left chocolates on the pillows, but nothing for us. It just seemed the service in general was lacking for such a nice hotel. Also, the food at both the Garden Court restaurant and room service was mediocre. And very pricy. And there are no coffee makers in the room, one of my biggest pet peeves. No mini bar either - just an empty fridge. The best thing about this hotel is the lobby. It's beautiful. I just don't think I'd stay here again just for that.</Text>

Due to major flight delay and flight cancellation shenanigans, my husband and I were already exhausted from lingering around SFO airport for several hours. 

When we checked into Palace hotel, we mentioned of our delayed flight. The check-in agent was friendly and welcoming. For once, when I politely asked if we can get a suite upgrade with my Platinum status, the agent actually made an effort to check suite availability and was able to make it happen. It probably helped that my husband mentioned they'd get the room back early in the morning. The suite was spacious and beautiful. Although it's an older hotel, the classy furnishings and decor were very much up to date. 

One minor issue was the toiletries were already half used. When I talked to guest services, they quickly brought a brand new set. We loved our stay and appreciated the Platinum recognition. I wish we didn't have to leave as early in the morning so we could try the Platinum breakfast.</review>

<Date>1487289600000< /Date><Rating>None</Rating><text>The palace never ceases to amaze me. The decor is spectacular, the staff are great and forever smiling and wanting to assist in anyway possible. I love the old school luxury charm and dedication to detail in the ambiance, decor and styling. I always stay here when i visit San Francisco. This last stay blew me away. It was our anniversary and you know women. My wife asked I cancel whatever plans as she didnt' feel like being bothered with celebrating so of course I did and canceled plans to SF and dinner.

Well the next day she hijacks my plans and books the palace and reschedules dinner. So last minute I was struggling to surprise her with champagne hours before we were to arrive. The front desk manager upgraded our room and upon entering I noticed they weren't able to fill my request for a bottle of champagne. Oh well we go out for hor d'oeuvres downstairs, great oysters & beer selection by the way. Upon return to our room was the loveliest card from the front desk manager, a bottle of champagne and fresh strawberry coated chocolates. We were so stunned by the thoughtfulness and really felt like you celebrated our anniversary with us. 

Over a decade as a dedicated SPG elite member and couldn't even think of venturing else where. Thank you!!!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

From the minute we stepped foot into the Palace everything was exceptional. Every single staff member from the valet, maid, concierge, front desk staff and the wedding staff were friendly, helpful and made our stay so wonderful. Loved being there. The entire hotel sparkled with beauty. We were there for a family wedding and it was like being in a magical fairy tale. Many, many thanks!<//review>

<text>I chose this hotel from among the SPG properties in San Francisco. I have been to nearly them all. This is one of the best, and I had such a good experience that I would likely pick this SPG hotel among the others next time. Good service, good accomodations, and good food (try the truffle fries in the lounge, and the Ghirardelli Hot Fudge Sundae on the first floor.)

This is an older hotel, with a great history, and beautiful restoration. Only smaller bathrooms would give a hint to its age (other than its historic charm.)< /text>< gmap_id>

<text>I've lived in this area for 33 years and never taken note of the Palace.  Now I can't imagine staying elsewhere!  I love the architecture, so old and elaborate.  But then the rooms have a certain modernity to them that I really enjoyed.  The beds were as comfy as anything I've ever slept in.  The room was perfectly appointed in every way.  Even if you can't really justify the expense to stay there, stop by and have a drink in the Garden Court!  Their drinks are top notch, swanky appetizers, leave feeling like a big shot.  Prices are commensurate with the experience, this is not a cheap date.  Totally worth it if a grand experience is what you want.</text></record>

Celebrated my 67th birthday in San Francisco with a 3 night stay. From check in to check out it was perfect. Every staff person, room service, bellman, concierge, bartenders, waiters were kind, attentive and took care of everything. There is an understated elegance to the Palace with modern where needed, i.e. the bathroom (Bidet!) and yet a quiet, civilized nod to the elegance when it began.<//Text>

<review>A great hotel stay.  Been staying at Marriott or Starwoods for nearly 2 decades for business, but went this time for personal.  Our stay was a great experience.  The service was great.  Concierge was very, very helpful (Maleah?).  Everyone from the valet to housekeeping to Garden Court was awesome.  I highly recommend.</review></record>

The hotel is a historical location in excellent condition. There is so much detail in the ceiling work I took at least 20 pics in the main ballroom to get it all. The bar feels like a classic 20's cigar Brandy room.< /Review>

The hotel just exudes opulence. We were awed with the immaculate inventories available and of course the staff of the hotel that made all the difference between a good hotel and excellent one.
Our room was kept very clean and neat daily.
The wedding anniversary amenities were a pleasant surprise for us. In short, it was a very memorable wedding anniversary.
A big thank you, especially to your Frontline staff, Ruben & Anthony.<//Text>

I was in San Francisco for a business meeting at Moscone. As a woman traveling alone, security is always a concern to me There were doormen at the door and security in the lobby. The hotel is a very short walk from the Market Street BART exit. Saturday morning I made a short half mile walk to the Ferry building.
This hotel is knock your socks off beautiful. I had tea here in the 1970's with a friends auntie. The memories of the tea in that grand room were always with me. I'm so glad I had a chance to return and enjoy the full experience as an adult. I was greeted by Jane, she was wonderful, charming and welcoming.. I was given a room on the 8th floor facing Market Street. The first thing that impressed me was how large the room was. Those eleven foot ceilings take your breath away
 The bathroom with it's marble floor and walk in shower was much larger than I expected and the Toto toilet with it's heated seat and full service bidet was a welcome treat for the travel weary. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. Loved the linens.
 Everything was wonderful. I look forward to visiting again.<//Text>

Stayed for 2 nights for our 12 yr anniversary and thoroughly enjoyed the comfort and cleanliness. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were treated to champagne and chocolate, which was a nice surprise. Convenient location. Walkable to Ferry Building (15 mins) for Napa Tour and to Pier 33 (25mins) for Alcatraz departure, SF playhouse (15min). The room was small but we were hardly there, so didn't matter to us. Would highly recommend. Cons: the walls are thin, could hear guy next door talking; on market st. could hear the traffic slightly, but we weren't bothered.</review>

The Palace Hotel is stunningly gorgeous, one of the nicest hotels that I have ever stayed at. Their breakfast buffet is a real treat. It's location on market Street and new Montgomery is not only centrally located with in the financial district, but it is also very well connected to the rest of the city because there is a BART and MUNI subway/streetcar stop right outside the west entrance.< /Review>

I loved this hotel and would definitely recommend to my friends. The only issue I had was there was no changing tables in the restrooms. I had to change my daughter in the stroller outside of the restroom. There needs to be that accessible to guests since there are tons of kids on site. More kid friendly. 

Thanks!< /text>

This is a beautiful property, however, if you are SPG Gold, don't expect any type of upgrade or recognition, even on paid stays. I stayed here for 5 nights a few weeks back. When I arrived, the front desk told me there were no upgrades available for the length of my stay, but there were plenty of rooms showing on the hotel's website. I truly believe they lied to my face. After 2 nights in a tiny room with no view, I saw availability on the website for an upgraded room, went back to the front desk, asked for a better room, and the same thing happened. When I politely pushed them, they "found" an upgraded room they could move me to for a fee. Sick of my tiny room, I reluctantly agreed to the increased rate and moved. This property does not value it's loyal members. I have to travel to SF consistently for work spending $3,000 - $4,000 per week. I'll most likely give my business to another hotel going forward. I realize that the Marriott merger has bombarded them with Marriott Gold/Platinum members who have matched their status with SPG, but I think the Palace should place a priority on those of us who have been Loyal to them for years. Truly, truly disappointed.<//Review>

<Text>As I’m at dinner at Olive Garden this evening, I am still completely in shock about the last 24 hours in which I spent at the Palace Hotel. Expecting royal treatment was obviously an extreme mistake! First of all, this IS NOT the place to stay in SF. From start to finish, my stay at the Palace hotel was disappointing to say the least. Although the staff was nice, that does not make up for the lack of service in an establishment like this. On a Friday evening they had only 1 doorman, who was obviously overwhelmed when we came to valet. 15 mins later we were finally checking in. Unfortunately our room was not ready (it was 7:30pm, check in is supposed to be at 3) so we were offered some drink cards from the restaurant while we wait, and were told it would only be 30 mins or so. We had prior dinner arrangements cancelled them due to our room not being ready. Unfortunately the service we received in the Pied Piper lounge was horrible. We were basically ignored the entire meal. We were seated in the back corner at a table that was obviously in need of fixing (since it wobbled so much we had to move) my “free drink” was disgusting and although I sent it back twice it was still put on my bill, and the appetizer that we ordered never came. The restaurant manager was sweet and sent a bottle of champagne to our room as well as comped our meal since I tried to pay for it but walked out since the server just walked past me twice as I held the bill out for her to take. We had of course left our bags with the bell desk to deliver to our room when it was ready. Since we were told at 8:40 that our room was finally ready for us, I told the bell desk our room number and asked again for our bags to be taken up, so after we dealt with the restaurant manager we finally went to our room. To our disappointment, it was NOT and upgraded room that we been told we were waiting for, it was the deluxe room the we had originally booked. And our bags were no where to be found. I called down to the bell desk and asked them to bring our bags up, but 45 minutes later we went down to retrieve them ourselves. After trying to laugh off this horrific stay, we decided to do some face masks and watch a movie. I pulled out the ice bucket drawer and it almost crushed my foot when it fell on the floor because it is broken. And then of course the tv remote had crusty old nasty stuff on the buttons! So we ordered a movie using tissues to cover our fingers so we could press the buttons. Our “complimentary breakfast” for all of the issues was blah. We were again seated in a corner with a table so wobbly that my coffee split without me even drinking it. The food wasn’t great, and I honestly ended up taking an orange and banana for my flight out. (I ate decent food at the airport later) Checking out was the icing on the cake. After all the issues, we were offered for our movie, dinner and breakfast to be complimentary and a free upgrade on our next stay! Wow! Palace Hotel, I promise you, we will NEVER stay at this establishment again!!! The lack of care or concern of quality for your guests comfort is truly appalling. As such a “fine hotel” I expected a higher standard than Holiday Inn but that’s basically the quality we got (except their breakfast is always complimentary). $300 for a room after everything “was comped.” A waste of time and money.... stay anywhere else in SF!!!</Text>< user_id>

<Text>The Palace is an interesting hotel, comfortable, and a very good location for the hub of activity in San Francisco. However, if you want a quiet area, go somewhere else. I strongly discourage patronizing the restaurant. For example, breakfast: the menu was extremely limited, the scrambled eggs unsettling, and all extremely expensive for what you get. Go outside the hotel for other restaurants for a much better meal for a quarter of the cost. For my next visit to San Francisco, I will probably stay at a different hotel nearby.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Rating>None</Rating><review>Overall, the Palace is a lovely hotel. It is in a prime location and the building itself is amazing. It's obviously San Francisco, so outside can be a bit noisy, but you'd expect that in any hotel.

The major downside during my stay was breakfast. The dining room is rather small, so there is only room for ~100 people to dine at a time. Not a big deal, but we were told that the wait would be ~20-25 minutes when it ended up being closer to 50-55 minutes. On many days this would just be a inconvenience, but we had a flight to catch, which didn't make the situation ideal. Then, once we were seated, we didn't have a waiter come to us to offer coffee / juice and explain the different menu options. After 10 minutes of waiting, I asked someone who brushed the request aside, and then asked the man who was seemingly the head of the restaurant. 10 minutes after that, I went up to the waiter stand and had to grab the OJ and bring it over as that was the only way I was going to get service that day apparently. The breakfast experience really ruined what is a fabulous hotel.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Rude guest services desk. Poor heating. The room was 67 degrees and took over an hour to go up a single degree. I'm sure this was nice when it was built but in the words of one of the staff "it's just an old building things don't work that well".<//text>< gmap_id>

We loved every bit of our stay at the Palace Hotel. The public spaces are amazing. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. The location can't be beat for proximity to Moscone Center and is central to many sights. Our room was lovely and our request for a quiet room on a high floor was accommodated. Great place to stay!</Text>

The hotel is absolutely gorgeous & great location! The staff was responsive & courteous at all times. Our major complaint was the food. We had lunch & the food was just OK. Service & drinks were outstanding, though. The High Tea wasn't what we expected AT ALL! The bread on the sandwiches was stale. The waiter wasn't polite in the least & simply whooshed the obviously prepared trays in front of us. We asked to take some of the leftovers & he simply plopped a box & bag down on the table in front of us.I wouldn't recommend the tea. However, the service & drinks in the beautiful bar area were outstanding. Would highly recommend. We LOVED the hotel & would happily go back!!!!</text>

<Text>Had a good stay at Palace. The impression upon arrival is amazing as the lobby is absolutely outstanding. Feels good to have breakfast in such a place!
Service at breakfast and food quality would need improvement for sure but seems like they are working on it. Same comment for the room cleaning.
Great location close to Market Street and Union Square.<//Text>< Rate>

I never received a turndown service the four days I stayed at the Palace. I would have never found out that you had a turndown service to begin with if I had not asked a colleague who traveled with me and stayed at the same hotel. Given that this was a great hotel, known for its service as well, and the fact that I was a gold member, I was really disappointed to find out this fact. I still enjoyed staying at your hotel, and have recommended others as well, but I hope to see better service the next time I stay there.</Review>

The Palace Hotel is wonderful. Guest services are very friendly and will accommodate your every need. My wife and I stayed for a few days on our honeymoon and loved almost everything. The pool is designed for working out and not so much for vacationing. I enjoyed the restaurant but they have a limited selection. The breakfast buffet was exceptional, but a little expensive. I hate to complain about price at a 5-star hotel, but regular coffee should not cost seven dollars. Besides that everything else has been marvelous. The location is perfect for tourism. There's a 15 minute walk to Chinatown or to the Port of San Francisco. We will definitely stay again but probably eat out on the town.</Review>

Our too-short visit to San Francisco was enhanced by a very comfortable stay at The Palace Hotel. The historic hotel's spectacular Garden Room demands a visit (as does its Ghiaradeli Ice Cream Shop!).Our room was sparkling clean with comfortable beds and down comforters and pillows. The staff was very personable, professional and helpful with directions and suggestions for dining, etc. The Palace is also very well situated near Union Square, the theatre district, Chinatown and North Beach-all within a healthy walking distance. I think we have found a new favorite place to stay!</review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>Used to be very loyal to this hotel but it is showing its age in the rooms and slipping of the service level. 

I had a mechanical problem with my room that I asked to be corrected and instead of the “we will be right on it” the response from the first request to the front desk was polite but no one ever came. When asking again to have the issue fixed front desk was “defensive that it wasn’t that agents problem” and again no resolution. So I finally gave up. 

It’s normally a nice hotel but seems like they are struggling to get the quality help they previously enjoyed. Garden Court is still grand and impressive but avoid a stay and you’ll be much happier.</Review>< Rating>

For a one night get away one can't beat the Palace. The location is perfect, right in the heart of San Francisco, walking distance to the Ferry Building, Union Square, Oracle Park and Westfield Mall.< /Text>

< Review>
My husband and I decided to stay at The Palace for our wedding anniversary visit. I am a Lifetime Platinum Rewards member with Marriott, so now have the same status with SPG. Therefore, we were told we'd be upgraded to a larger room on the top floor, and given "special recognition" for our anniversary. Well, a room on the top floor was not ready when we checked in (3 pm, the "legal" time) so we ended up on the 4th floor. The front desk clerk also missed the fact that we'd booked a rate that included the breakfast buffet. I had to inquire about it. The room we got was large and lovely but NO dresser drawers!!! Just a closet?! When I called the front desk, they told me that to maintain the "integrity of the rooms" (whatever that means?) rooms had either a closet OR a dresser?! I was offered to switch to a room with drawers, but no closet?! We stayed put. There was also no light in the closet. Hard to see in the evening. We were given a lovely bottle of wine. On checking out we saw we'd been charged for breakfast one morning ($92 for two persons) even though our rate included breakfast. The bill was corrected, but it never should have happened.
Staff were very nice.<//Review>

<text>What happened to the Palace brunch?? Still a beautiful place but the service was horrible. From the start, no butter or jam served with the croissants, no coffee refills and she didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. Our Omelets were good, so the issue is not the kitchen. We ended up going to the four seasons for dessert and coffee and wow it was 180 degrees different. Great friendly service and wonderful dessert and coffee. In the future we will skip the brunch at the Palace but the Pied Piper bar is still one of our favorites!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

We stopped at the Palace on the recommendation of a member of the Staff at Gumps. Every staff member greeted us when we passed with a genuine smile. The rooms are nicely updated with a modern feel. Would recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone especially if you would like to treat yourself.<//text>

<text>The hotel was beautiful. The lobby, the lounge area and the conference rooms were all very nice. The staff was pleasant and courteous.
My issue was with my room. For the price, and expectation, I thought the room would have been better maintained. The windows were not functional, I was on the 7th floor and could hear people talking on the street, cars, trucks and motorcycles at all hours, as if my window was wide open. Yet, it was closed. When I checked the lock, it fell off. It was not screwed down. The main light switch, in entry way of room, popped off when I first pressed it. The toilet seat seemed a bit dirty, not sure if it was cleaned properly. I had booked a King Size bed, confirmed it and when I got to my room it was two double beds. That's fine, the beds were nice and the cleaning staff did a good job with my room.
Again, for the money, I expected better as far as my accommodations.</text><resp>None<//resp><Rating>None< /Rating>< user_id>

My 9yo and I recently stayed at this hotel and we BOTH loved it. The staff was fantastic (from bellmen, to front desk to housekeepers), the room was huge, and the hotel in general was gorgeous and historic. As always, the beds were super comfortable and there was an array of different pillow types for feather v. foam sleepers. My son loved the pool and we met nice kids and parents up on the pool deck relaxing in the late afternoon.

On the note of children, this hotel was particularly kid friendly and sent cookies and milk up for my son on check in. There also appeared to be a number of kid activities (that we really did not have time for).

This hotel is convenient to public transportation and it's easy to walk to tons of things (Alcatraz, China town etc.) from here. 

We cannot wait to go back!< /review>

Genuinely seemed to understand that we were tired and could use our room right away. Breakfast in the Palace dining room was fantastic. Great selection of excellently prepared foods. Beautiful room with high ceiling and great acoustics. Helpful staff. Wish I could have stayed longer.< /Text><UserId.>None< /UserId.><Rate>None</Rate>< gmap_id>

It is a beautiful Hotel... but def not worth the expense! Just visit  by getting an ice cream at the Ghirardelli in their lobby, which is by the way always extremely crowded. Dont be fooled by the pictures, double rooms have only full size beds, NO queen available. No coffee maker in the standard rooms. That was my bad research.  My husband and I and our 14yr old son  thought we would stick it out... but after the first night we called the front desk for options. When we asked if another room was available with kings or a roll out bed, we couldnt. We had to upgrade to a suite as all king size rooms with a pull out couch were booked & you can not get a roll out bed in the doubles (something about california law??) . We decided to upgrade to a suite: For the very "good deal" of $250 per night! The suite was indeed amazing, but way too pricey! The place was clean, which it should for the money!  Do not eat breakfast there or room service unless you want to break the bank. $150.00 for 3 very standard eggs was insane. The indoor pool is unique and cool.  They have a hot tub, which we used every early morning. After walking around all day for 10 days our bodies were Sore! It helped. As the lobby is open to tourists, you need your key fob to use the elevators which is annoying  when they dont work. Had to get it 2 of our key fobs switched 2x.<//review>

Enjoyed my recent stay at the Palace Hotel. The bed was very comfortable and I might need to BUY one of the pillows for home! The food and coffee were wonderful and the public spaces of the hotel sparkle. Room for a bit of improvement: check-in was understaffed at 8:00 PM, the water pressure in the shower was lower than I prefer (glad I didn't have to wash long hair), and a bit of competing noise (A/C?) in conference room areas.<//review>

From now on, the Palace is the only place I'm going to stay while in San Francisco. It's right in the center of everything, with the most beautiful facilities/rooms. Quiet, luxurious...we loved every minute! The only thing it could use is a world-class spa :)< /review>

<response>None</response><user_id>115362898003952244191</user_id><Text>Nice hotel in terms of decor on the common areas, but the hallways to the rooms themselves felt a bit dank. I checked in early because apparently my room was ready and I received an upgrade with my gold elite status.

When I arrived, I was a bit surprised that my gold elite upgrade ended me up on a 2nd floor room facing loud Market st. It was also very far from the elevator. Neither of my requests (high floor, close to elevator) were met. I am unsure what aspect of the room was an upgrade.

Note: You can't even take the stairs if you wanted to because the layout doesn't support stairs too well (it's technically an emergency exit). So you are forced to take the elevator even from floor 2.

The windows were not soundproof because I could hear the sound of muni busses and yelling homeless people. I did contact them over the app about it, but thought that since my stay was only one night, I did not want to bother with switching rooms.

In terms of hotel layout, this place is huge. You may end up walking 5min from the elevator to get to your room as that is how large it is.

I did not try any of the restaurants. I have heard there is 75 dollar high tea in the lounge.

Location wise, it is convenient if you need to be close to Fidi or Soma, but if you know how SF is these days, homeless mental people are often around in this area, so stay safe and avoid eye contact.< /Text><Date>1567432222271</Date>< rate>

Beautiful property. The rooms are newly furnished and filled with lovely touches. Only three issues: One, the Hostess at the Garden Court didn't want to allow us to get a coffee at breakfast, saying that she didn't have any free tables ... other than the fact that I was looking at twenty free tables. She then qualified that she didn't have any free tables at 12:30 (we were there at 11:30). We went around the block to Starbucks. Second, minor issue, my bathroom door wouldn't close. Perhaps something with the hinge. Third, the cleaning crew was pretty loud in the hallway and woke me up both days. I'm guessing this is due to the rooms being so shallow. All these are minor concerns to me. I love the property, location, and price point. The Conceirges (all three lovely Ladies) we brilliant in securing us last minute dinner reservations. I will definitely be back and will make the Palace my default hotel for business and leisure in SF.</review>

Cool hotel bar called pied piper. Good drinks, normal SF pricing. Only had a few drinks and went home so not much to say. Ambiance seemed nice, assortment leather lounge chairs, high bar stools, or normal table types to choose from. Wings were delicious.</review>

The only complaint I have is from Pied Piper. It was pretty busy on a Saturday night, but I felt like the waitresses passed our table a few times before getting us menus or asking if we've been helped. We ordered the burger since "it was the best burger in the bay." That didn't quite ring true. It took 26 minutes for our burgers to arrive and it was dry and unimpressive and I think they forgot to add bacon. You'd be much better off going to Gott's Burgers in the Ferry Building for a delicious, juicy burger.< /text><rating>None< /rating></record></dataset><record>

I've stayed at a few SPG properties in downtown SF, and this was hands down the best! The hotel is gorgeous and the staff are outstanding. I didn't eat here so I can't comment on the dining. There is a pool and fitness area - open late. The location is central and safe; also right off the BART for easy airport transportation. I definitely recommend staying here and will be back myself!<//Review>

With a convenient SOMA location, this hotel cannot be beat for its quality and comfort. Staff is pleasant, courteous and helpful. Rooms are quiet and well appointed although the bathrooms are a bit tight. I could have used a "flatter" pillow but that's minor overall. Common areas, lobby, etc. are beautiful and relaxing.< /Text>

The Palace Hotel rates itself as a luxury hotel, but the standard of service was not up to par. The room was OK, and I notice that it was not kept very clean, especially the floor was not vacuumed every day. Strikers were making too much noise and it was very annoying. Add this to the pollution from the nearby forest fire, guests were getting a raw deal from visiting San Francisco. The staff were not that helpful on this occasion. I guess they were stretched to the limits because of the strike. Then the management should reduce the price, as we were not getting our money's worth<//review>

We have stayed at the Palace a number of times and it's our favorite hotel in San Francisco. We attended the Matisse exhibition at the MOMA a short walk away. Our room which had been upgraded was excellent #740 and to our surprise recently renovated - excellent. Every detail was perfect.
Please complement Arturo (from Peru) at reception for his excellent customer service and in his choice for our room.
Also, a wonderful breakfast to start our Day. Thank you, Patrick and Pamela< /review>

I have just copied the email I issued to the hotel manager. Its 0300hrs and I felt it important enough to submit here too :
Thanks for organising the welcome gift. Additionally I appreciate you providing a Junior Suite upgrade to make my stay more comfortable.

I wanted to ensure that the comments received you directly and avoided completing the in room card.

It is currently just before 0300hrs.

I have had a number of disappointments with my stay in your hotel and I wanted to share this with you.

1) Upon arrival at 1415hrs my room was un-available
2) Left luggage and departed for town. Upon return at 2045 I requested the bags be delivered to the room. I popped to the bar. 2130 in the room ( without my baggage ). Was informed upon going to reception that bags are not delived to rooms if one is not in the room ?? If so - this could have been mentioned at reception
3) Upon arrival to the room ahead of the baggage team the attached photos(in zip file) indicate the 'old' room service left outside my room at 2130.
4) Since just a prior to midnight until time of writing - no running water in the room. Apparently as I was informed upon calling down maintenance was being carried out. This resulted in a very uncomfortable stay. Unable to shower and the toilet could not be used due to the natural risks I am sure you are aware of.
What was particularly annoying is that NO ONE considered informing the guests.
However - the team were prompt to do door drops of all invoices at 0230hrs.
4)Just stepped outside to place my "Privacy Note"....Please see flash photos (IMG.....the tray, glasses and plates in the corridor remain and the smell is present in my room.

This has not been a Luxury Collection experience. Just a disappointment.< /Review>

The overall experience was great! We went to get drinks at the bar and then we walked over to Ghirardelli for some ice cream and cookies. The hotel is very clean. The security is really good at keeping the homeless out as well. Overall the great experience!</text>

<rate>3</rate><text>I like to wander in here when I'm feeling square and affluent enough, although the wine is steep (but/or I'm a plebian), and the lighting & seating arrangements aren't as intimate or dramatic as I like out of a hotel bar, which is to say it's bright and airy like the lobby.

Could have a dark, cozy vibe more like the lounge seating at the Chicago Athletic Association, in Chicago. But it does not.

Nevertheless it's comfortable, friendly and well-provisioned. I imagine it provides tremendous solace for travelers.</text></record>

We stayed at the Palace for a couple of nights between Christmas and New Years with our adult daughter. This was our first time at the Palace and everything about our stay was great. The room was large and comfortable, the hotel is beautiful and in a great location. The hotel staff was great and very accommodating. On our last day I did not feel well but our flight home was not until the evening and was delayed. At no charge, the manager arranged for a new room where I could stay and rest until we needed to go to the airport. I expected to pay something extra for that privilege but was charged nothing. Very classy place!< /Text>

Beautiful hotel with great rooms and a beautiful dining area, bar, and meeting spaces for your event. The hotel is classic in its design and tasteful, not gaudy. I visited for a few days for a convention of sorts and the various spaces offered everything we needed for small, more intimate groups as well as large spaces for broad presentations. The spaces were nicely put together and were a pleasure to be in.</Review>

We had a very interesting guided tour of the Palace Hotel, which highlighted its linkage to the history of San Francisco. The guide told us that “The Pied Piper” painting by Maxfield Parrish is being restored and we look forward to seeing it on our next visit.< /review>< name>

Unless you opt for a junior suite or suite, the rooms are not very big, but they are very comfortable, and are well serviced in terms of housekeeping, etc. I have been staying there whenever I visit San Francisco for the last several years. It's location is very hard to beat. People should avoid driving and parking in San Francisco, but it's not a problem because it's a city blessed with abundant public transportation options. The hotel's Market Street entrance faces the Montgomery BART/MUNI stop. You can get on BART at SFO and arrive at your hotel about 30 minutes later. To explore the city, you have MUNI right there and are within strolling distance of many iconic sights in the city.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>My wife and I were at the Palace for 6 nights.
The room was spacious and comfortable.
All the hotel employees from front desk to
doormen to maids to concierge were all very
friendly and courteous. The location was very
good in that public transportation was so readily accessible. The public rooms were all
beautiful and fun to visit. We had a great stay
at the Palace.< /Review>< user_name>

I was there for two nights for work, rates were in line with everything in San Fran. My Suite Night Awards were filled and the room was fantastic.

The bar was great, one of those great big old oak bars that you just want a big martini and a cigar.

Gym was fine, pool was great as well (although a little on the short side)< /text>< name>

Every stay is about people. People play an important role at my stays at Starwood Hotels. And the associates from the Palace Hotel were very friendly and forthcoming.
Also my SPG Gold status was greatly recognized with a wonderful room upgrade. The room was clean and spacey, and the Spa/Pool/Whirlpool is a great place to relax in the heart of San Francisco. The Palace is a well located hotel combined with a jaw dropping architecture and great restaurants in the building.
All in all, the staff made my stay in SF perfect. I recommend the Palace.</Review>

<review>I stayed here recently for a conference and knew there would be a staff strike going on. It was appalling. The noise from the striking staff started early and finished late. The picket line was aggressive and made us feel like criminals on entering and leaving the hotel, particularly when boarding pre-arranged coaches.

There was no room service, no coffee machine, and a limited and expensive breakfast buffet service. Additional the hotel bars and restaurants were either not open, or only open for a couple of hours.

We were offered no discount and or complimentary service beyond some warm glasses of wine each evening. Utterly Appalling.

<Date>1499558400000< /Date><rate>None<//rate><review>I'm a regular visitor to San Francisco and thought I'd expand my repertoire of hotels on a recent visit, but was disappointed with numerous elements at this hotel, and specifically the upgrade policy for Platinum members. SPG status recognition is not a priority here! I requested a slightly early early check-in of 3:00 PM since the hotel has a later-than-average 4:00 PM check-in. I repeated this request when the concierge contacted me prior to arrival and also stated a preference for a room with a sitting area if possible. When I arrived at 3:00 PM, I was offered a standard room, the option to wait for an upgraded room, or another option to pay a surcharge that was higher than even the room rate for a Deluxe Suite. I agreed to wait and when the hotel called 90 minutes minutes later to tell me my room was ready, I received a small room with no sitting area or view. When I called to see if I could at least get a room with a street view, they promised to call back with options, and 90 minutes later I was still waiting. When I finally went to the front desk to request a room change, they lowered the surcharge for the suite but insisted that it could not be waved. While I assume the hotel might offer the technicality that it was a "Deluxe Suite" and did not fall into the category of a standard suite, it was a basic corner suite that a W, Westin or Sheraton would have no issue upgrading a platinum member to on a complimentary basis. In addition, when I looked at room availability online, there were numerous rooms available in a higher category that what I had been offered, and that provided street views. Apparently none were ready for check-in by 6:00 PM. Add to this that while an SPG plaque is present at the front desk, there is no separate queue, so as a platinum member, you have to step around the line of waiting guests and be subject to them being upset with you in order to enjoy the benefit of an expedited check-in</review>< pictures>

<Rate>None< /Rate><Review>I was surprised when my room was not made up at all during my stay. I expected no fresh towels or bedding -- as that makes sense for the environment. But no tidying at all? Geez. I know the check-in guy advised me of something about towels and things upon checkin -- but not about no tidying. Also I had a great view of nothing from my second floor room. I took a photo because no one would believe that I truly looked into nothing -- a stained glass window. Yuk. What a terrible reward for a SPG member. And finally, I was sent a package while I was there. It was never delivered to my room, nor was I called or emailed regarding the delivery. I had to go to the front desk to inquire.
Hello Palace Hotel -- a little better service please!<//Review>< pics>

<Rating>None< /Rating><Text>While the overall appearance of the hotel is beautiful, the rooms were pretty and the Garden Court really amazing, the execution of day to day stuff was terrible. The check-in line stretched back out of the lobby and into the dining room - maybe 30+ people deep and barely moving - people had taken to laying on the floor. Only two people working the desk at peak hours? Who thought that was a good idea? I had to ask about a platinum line and was allowed to jump ahead but even that took quite a while and wasn't something the hotel made any effort to facilitate. The rooms are very pretty, definitely "European petite" in size and have little water pressure - it took my wife 20 minutes to get the shampoo out of her hair. Also no functioning air conditioning. The noise outside the hotel at night had us awake before dawn each day. Location would be good during the week but on weekends the financial district (and all the restaurants) closes. My Platinum Ambassador had called ahead to alert them that we were there to celebrate a birthday and anniversary but no upgrade, no mention, nothing.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

This hotel is just beautiful. It's also comfortable and accommodating. I was attending a conference held at The Palace, and all of the meeting rooms were well organized and easy to find. Our hotel room was very comfortable and a nice size. Too often older hotels have very small rooms, but not true here. I highly recommend it.<//Review>

Everybody working at the hotel was friendly and really seemed like they enjoyed and took pride in their job - we especially had a great experience at the front desk, and in the fitness facility which is helmed by the most attentive and friendly woman (she brought us towels to the machines, and offered us fresh apples and water when we left - she really helped make our stay extra special). Our room was wonderful, we really enjoyed breakfast in the main dining room and drinks/snacks in the bar. Overall this is just a really well run and very beautiful old-style hotel. I look forward to staying here again.<//review>< Time>

This hotel has more personality than those of big chains. Beautiful woodwork, large pool, attentive staff, well located: we do not regret our choice! the only downside is the mattress that was a little too soft.</Review>

<Rate>None</Rate><Review>This is my first time staying in San Francisco at a Sheraton hotel and perhaps I am not used to San Francisco travel, but I usually have become accustomed to basic suite upgrades or if they don't have a junior suite, they will give me a room with a great view at all Sheraton and Marriott Hotels (I live in hotels weekly) When checking in the person mentioned I got upgrade, so I was expecting a suite, or perhaps a room with a view, but instead I get a small room with no view.

Overall great location beautiful property, customer service needs improvement. I stayed for 3 nights when running the San Francisco Marathon. I booked several months in advance and asked for a room with 2 beds. I even called to confirm that I needed 2 beds. When we checked in there was not a room with 2 beds available and when I complained and said there were 3 of us they said the room type was not guaranteed and others had booked months in advance. I had to point out I had booked months in advance and I was platinum guest before they even made an attempt to resolve the situation. They also asked that I pay for an upgrade! When I called down to ask for a late check out the initially denied the request and I again had to point out I was platinum guest. I stopped into the restaurant to ask for a bowl and utensils the waiter responded in an annoyed tone and asked where I was taking them.< /text>

As usual, the Palace was wonderful. Nothing quite like the crisp white sheets, excellent mattress and firm and supporting pillows. I ordered room service this trip...I was little too tired to step outside. The chophouse salad was wonderful and the shrimp cocktail...perfect complement. I had the dimsum for the entree. It was just OK...but I love that I could have this variety from a hotel menu. This is the kind of hotel my grandparents would have stayed at. Refined elegance still defines the palace. Grandpa and Grandma sure knew how to live!<//Review>

<text>Booked 2 rooms. One for myself and one for a couple we were traveling with. Unfortunately, our friends room had issues, and even after they changed room the new room had issues once again. Ruan (I think that's how you spell her name), the night front desk manager, was more than accommodating. She went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect. At times I demand a bit too much, but she made sure to meet all our expectations. Thanks to her, I'd recommend this place to everyone. The staff is 5/5, the hotel is 4/5.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

The hotel has checked a lot of boxes. Great location, very grand garden court, and absolutely beautiful high ceiling rooms with some old charms but updated amenities. And among all of those, the price is very reasonable for the quality the hotel provides. There are some small imperfection, however. The front desk staff did not recognize my elite status, and also did not mention the benefits of the package that I booked until I inquired about it. The turn down service is a nice touch, but it would have been better if a bucket of ice was provided. To be honest, these are really nitpicking. I wouldn't hesitate to book the hotel again if I'm around the area.</review>

Such a treat. This was our first visit to The Palace Hotel -- we booked a long weekend in a suite for a special pre-baby getaway. We were so pleased with the room accommodations, dining in the tea garden as well as room service, the staff, the amenities, local recommendations and more.

We've traveled extensively and Morey at the front desk went way beyond what we've experienced before and was particularly helpful.

We look forward to many more visits, and to returning with our baby!</text>

The Palace Hotel is one of the most romantic hotels in San Francisco. This hotel is timeless and elegant when you first check-in. I have stayed here about 10 or 15 times and I always feel like I have escaped to 1930's San Francisco with the fortunate realization of having modern technology. Walking in the hallways alone lets you know this hotel is historic because the attention to details on the doors, walls, rugs is magnificent. The chandeliers add an accent to every part of the hotel. The rooms are plush and the bathrooms have high quality amenities. The hotel bar is the best place to have client meetings and after you are done - GO TO THE ROOFTOP POOL and JACUZZI. This is one of the few hotels in San Francisco that has an indoor pool and hot tub that allows you to relax. This hotel is one of the best in the world and if you don't stay here... you will regret it!< /Review>

I have wanted to stay at the Palace for some time and finally got the chance this past weekend- what a treat! The staff was friendly and courteous - every member of the staff that we encountered was friendly and helpful- the rooms were spotless- our amenities were perfect and replenished magically while we were out- they were very accommodating to all of our requests and needs-the breakfast was wonderful- the room service menu and times were fabulous! 
Beautiful hotel in a wonderful city and perfect location- highest rating- and thank you all for a magical vacation-< /text>

My family and I enjoyed our stay at the Palace. The beds were super comfy. Your staff from the front door, the check in desk and all the restaurants were stellar. I believe your people are your greatest assets, applause all around.

Now here's my tiny suggestion, the facilities my need a little maintenance paint touch ups etc. the lobby bathroom needs a little lift.</Review>

The lounge and restaurant in the lobby are breathtaking! I listened to llive music under the amazing leaded glass domed ceiling and felt like I had been transported to Europe. My husband had a delicious chicken dish with vegetables in a subtle ginger tomato broth in the Pied Piper bar. Staff were always accommodating and eager to please and will bend over backwards to insure that your stay is flawless. In spite of being sick and feeling lousy I was still able to relish the luxurious rooms and had a great night's sleep!! Thank you for all the ways you reached out, your gestures were greatly appreciated and will always be remembered.</review>

Upon arrival at the listed arrival time, we were told that our room, and no rooms within that type were ready due to needing to be cleaned. We were not early, but rather on time. There was. I explanation given and we were pointed to a bar where we could wait. We had to check our bags and join all the other guests waiting for their rooms.

Two hours later, after spending more than we would have preferred and having to get a code to use a bathroom, we got to our room and could prepare for our dinner reservations. These were delayed even further because one of our bags was lost from the checking and I had to go to the storage room and find it.

When we checked out, we could see the same problem unfolding for the travelers arriving that day. Waiting around, even sleeping in the lobby/bar.

The staff was trying and the facilities were nice, but clearly there was not enough staff on hand to take care of the number of guests.

$60 for parking, no rooms upon our arrival, lost bag and overworked staff. Not the luxury we had in mind I'm afraid.</review>

If you wish to take a trip back in time to the luxury or yore during your SF stay...this is the place to be. Since it is an older, historic Grande Dame of a hotel the rooms can range from fantastic to adequate but there are so many other reasons to stay here. The atmosphere of SF's storied past surrounds you in the best way possible. There is no better way to begin a day than to have breakfast in the Palace's beautiful Garden Court. The bustling,trendy bar is crowned with a Maxfield Parrish painting to die for. The 4th floor indoor pool is worth a peek even if you don't swim. Fitness room good and served by helpful staff. Public spaces and hallway display cases are filled with interesting photos and documents. Above all the staff is uniformly helpful.</Text>

<review>Unpleasant experience with the front desk “manager” who was more insistent on being right than helping a guest overcome a room snafu. I requested to escalate to his superior for assistance and he offered (read threatened) to cancel my room for the night. Won’t be coming here again when the Four Seasons is a block away.

Also- terribly surprised by the peeling paint in the hallways.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Really nice staff, good view from certain rooms, and the rooms are cleaned nicely when you leave. The hotel staff replaced my worn deodorant with a brand new stick of the same brand of deodorant. I would highly recommend this for anyone staying in San Francisco.<//text><date>1489544153977<//date>< userid>

I was hesitant to book The Palace based on quite a few negative reviews. Was on the fence with St Regis as I've stayed there in the past and had a great experience. Ultimately I decided to try out the Palace.

From the moment we arrived at the front door, we received outstanding service. The bellman took our bags and was very informative and courteous.

We waited less than a minute in line to check in. As we arrived at 1PM, I wasn't expecting our room to be ready. Without having to ask, I was told that I was upgraded to a Superior Suite. Great SPG recognition. They took my phone # and called me just around 4PM informing me my room was ready.

Upon entering our suite, the first thing that strikes you is the beautiful detail of the room. 11 foot high ceilings with ultra-white crown moldings with tasteful light gray walls appointed with more ultra-white moldings on the walls. There was a nice desert waiting for us as I had told them we were celebrating my daughters birthday.

The bathroom featured a very clean white marble palette with the TOTO "drinking fountain." The bed was very comfortable with no bed bugs to be found. (I do check every hotel for bed bugs)

We enjoyed the indoor pool and jacuzzi. Although the pool did appear to be heated, it could have been 10 degrees warmer. The gym was generously sized with all the standard equipment.

As a Platinum, I selected the breakfast award. Great choice! Probably one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had. For an extra $7, you can get the full buffet which featured all the hot and cold selections. Not sure if I'd pay the full $39 for it, but it was absolutely worth trying as an award. The only minor complaint is that they seated us in the corner next to the bussing station. But we were dressed like tourists so that was understandable. The regular clientele were definitely business folk during the week.

We decided to take BART back to the Oakland airport. Montgomery St Station is right outside the Hotel, so that was a breeze.


Overall, an outstanding stay. Great service from all staff, great SPG recognition, great location. Will definitely be back with the rest of the family.< /Text>

The level of privacy within your room is very low. Other guests are easy to hear through the walls and they can hear you as well. Aside from this, the location is great and the main level is beautiful.

If you are looking for a quiet place to get away to this hotel is great. If you are looking to spend more time in your room talking with friends and loved ones, don't be surprised with the noise complaints.<//Review>

The check-in staff did not really specially recognize your status ( at least in my case ), although they did mention choose between breakfast and welcome points. But that's about it. 

 I booked junior suite but I did not realize I had the wrong date of booking (due to my time lag in Beijing). Fortunately they fixed the booking and gave me the room when I actually arrived one day ahead. 

I booked junior suite but was assigned a second floor Grande Deluxe room. Was told that there was no big difference between the two room types...Ok, 2nd floor is a bit noisy to help good sleep. And as a platinum member, this should be an upgrade rather than downgrade? Extremely disappointed in this. 

I do understand that for the first day it is a last minute change so no suite is there, but for the second day I do have the junior suite booked and confirmed. But this is not an option mentioned by the check-in staff. 

Breakfast is superb, well worth the price. But again, I forgot to bring the voucher the first day and was charged for the full price.

Overall it is a good but not decent hotel. I would consider stay here next time, but not sure about that. So many options in SFO.</Review>

This was our second stay at The Palace and we loved it even more this time!
The staff was attentive, polite, and helpful. The food in the bar far exceeded our expectations for a light snack so we went back for dinner and were thrilled with the food.
The location is perfect.
Some furniture in the room could use updating, but overall we loved it.
Will be back!< /text>

This is one of the most beautiful hotels in the world filled with the most gracious and caring staff! From the moment we walked up to the front desk, Blessie went out of her way to meet and exceed all of our expecations :o) She made us feel welcome and special, and the kindness she exuded is something that I will always remember! In the dining room, which is so beautiful words cannot describe, we enjoyed an amazing breakfast and the service was fantastic from Mario and Magdalanea.<//Review>

The Palace is beautiful. We loved breakfast in the Garden Court and returned each afternoon for cocktails before dinner. We had a great dinner at the Pied Piper restaurant, too.
Our room was clean, but small. I was told we were upgraded (as a Gold guest), but I'm fairly sure our room was the same room we had booked- it was very small and had no drawers for unpacking clothes. We ended up with suitcases on the the floor in the room because there was nowhere to put our clothes. There is a massive headboard/nightstand built in, but there were no drawers in it. I expect to be able to unpack my clothes when I book a stay at a hotel as expensive as the Palace.
Finally, most of the front desk staff left me disappointed. I asked one of the front desk staff if he would mind taking a picture of my husband and I- his response was, "If you are quick about it." If he was too busy, he should have offered someone else who might have been able to take the picture- his response was just rude (especially given that taking a picture takes much less than a minute). The Concierge team was great, though- they were the most thoughtful employees I encountered at the hotel.
All in all, the palace is a beautiful hotel and we had a great stay. It would have been even better if the employees seemed eager to help and the rooms had a place to put your folded clothes.</text>

We spoke with several members of the staff at The Palace hotel and everyone was terrific, especially Greg in maintenance. We engaged him in a conversation while in the hallway one afternoon and told him our names. We happened to see him on two subsequent occasions and much to my surprise he remembered our names both times and asked how we were enjoying our stay and if there was anything we needed.< /review>

Gorgeous facility with spacious meeting space and a great floor plan within a short walk to Moscone Center. Nice restaurant; every dish elegantly prepared; good service. Wonderful staff, extremely courteous and quick to respond. Well designed lodging rooms but baths are small. Beautiful floral arrangements in the foyer, hallways and restaurants provide a warm and gracious welcome!</Review>

We had been told we were upgraded when we checked in as we are gold status, but nothing special about the room, so I am not sure it was an upgrade, or if it was, I worry what the other room looked like. This was my 2nd stay at an SPG after achieving gold status, and so far, I am not sure it's worth trying to maintain.<//Text>< date>

The Palace Hotel is simply elegant. It's architecture and decor initially dazzles with light and color play that soon allows you to feel very comfortable. The staff's friendliness continues the comfort level so you can enjoy the ammenities the hotel has to offer.

The air comfort control near the entrance to the room was easy to program and delivered the desired comfort zone. The king size bed was like nesting in quality linens yet firm for a deep sleep. The bathroom had a beautiful old marble counter, scounces that dimmed on each side of a large gold gilded mirror and ample space to manuever. A small round magnified mirror on an arm was available as well for close up work. The water pressure was steady and strong with immediate hot water.

My only concern was the carpet and the bathroom floor needed some cleaning attention.

I have and will recommend the Palace to friends and family. I will also be staying at the Palace again.< /Text>

The hotel room, which was an upgrade, had beds that are ok, but not exactly great. The size was the issue, not very wide. An upgraded room should have 2 queen beds, or not offer the option of 2 beds.
The gym and pool were very good. The gym could have better elliptical machines, but other then that was great. Offered sauna as well. Restaurant and bar are excellent, top quality.<//Text>

This is a truly exceptional hotel. In a fabulous location for so many things, one walks into an oasis in the middle of the bustling city. The Garden Court has to be one of the most beautiful eating areas in any city hotel in the world with the surrounding lobby areas matching the grandeur. The staff were delightful and my room, apart from having a shower curtain, was perfect. I was in a large group and every one of us had issues connecting to the intenet in our rooms which staggered us given the standard of the hotel. Nevertheless, I loved it and would go back any time.</text>

There are some places you stay that just make you feel important. Debbie even mapped out our days for us so we could get the most out of our short visit and make sure we see all the sights in an efficient way. Amazing location at a walking distance to the Moscone Center, Financial District and Union Square.<//text>

Classy classic upscale hotel. Great location. Perfect service and treatment by top Starwood staff. Rooms have character. Small but more than adequate. Fantastic bed and bedding for a great night's sleep. My package included free wifi in room; otherwise wifi is available for free in the lobby along with great coffee starting at 5:30 am.

It's rare that a hotel of this size can make an individual guest seem so welcome and important
The front office staff were so helpful and even the bell hop was extraordinary in his level of service.
When I got to the airport I discovered that I had left my passport in my room safe. One call to the hotel and my pass port was in my hand a half hour later -now tats service
I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any visitor to San Francisco< /Text>

<Review>The hotel is all right but not great. Can do better for the same amount elsewhere. The service was ok, breakfast was also ok, the room was probably below average. When the room has a view of the wall it should have something inside that is of interest to compensate, it can’t be so run of the mill. So - it was alright but it wasn’t great, same is true about service and about food at breakfast. There just wasn’t anything special about it. I’d rather stay elsewhere another time.< /Review>< Pics>

Beautiful hotel, center of the city. Room was average size with high ceilings, very nice bathroom and comfortable bed. Gorgeous inside the lobby (there was a wedding or something happening during our stay). Lots of traffic getting there to the valet but otherwise great.</Review>

Grand hotel, great style, very centrally located but with mediocre service. Long queue for check-in. Not enough restaurants and space for guests so that without a reservation you end up having to go outside for breakfast! Rooms on Market Street have interesting views but are loud. Rooms in courtyard are quiet but since courtyard is narrow you are to close to rooms across. Beds are comfortable. Valet parking can be slow to retrieve your car at busy times. It took once 30' (maybe an exception). All-in-all a bit of a disappointment.</Text>

<Text>excellent welcome by a professional team
The room have space and are very confortable BUT the sound insulation does not exist and you can hear all what is happening in the hotel near your room. A pitty for such a class hotel.
The buffet were good , no more and the breakfast could have more choices ( like cheese, ham,..)< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</GmapID></record>

The rooms are quite small and dated for the price. Our room's toilet paper roll holder was falling off the wall, the shower door did not close correctly, there were missing handles for the storage cases, and the drapes needed cleaning--something was crusted on them that looked like lotion. I think the hotel would benefit from a supervisor checking the rooms periodically to avoid these types of things.< /Text>

<Review>I was highly disappointed in the service I got here for my stay. My hotel room temperature was not at a comfortable level. I call Friday night and they had the engineer check it out all he did was show us how to decrease the temperature. I then called Saturday morning before leaving for the day to have someone check it again because it was not going lower than 72 degrees. I called the front desk again at 3pm on Saturday to see if the engineer came in that morning and he didn't. They said they'll send someone that afternoon and no one showed up. I then called again to request someone to check the AC around 11pm and no one showed up after the person at the front desk said they will be there in 15 minutes. I'm currently booked at the Palace from March and throughout April due to work. I'm working in San Francisco till June, I would hate to go to book with a different hotel since I do like the location of the Palace. I was highly disappointed with the service I got this past weekend.< /Review>< UserId.>

Very unfortunate to stay during the week they had a strike. It’s a truly elegant and decorated property and has a history, but the room was not as pleasant since it was pretty simple. The shower did not offer a strong and warm enough water flow which is what really led me down. The location is convenient though.</Text>

The palace is a classic beautifully maintained experience. If you want gigantic rooms and no atmosphere don't come here. But if you do , expect beautifully maintained rooms with the original spirit and architecture. Truly a luxury experience for a center city hotel.

That being said a few years ago I was upgraded for free to presidential suite. I think it was 2200 square feet on tge 8th floor with a grand piano fireplace dining table for about 12. Amazing!!!!< /Text>

I cannot compliment the team of this hotel enough. I recently stayed at the palace as a celebration of my 40th birthday. From the minute we checked in until the minute we left the service was exemplary A special mention for Morey at the front desk who not only ran upstairs to check and see if our room was ready but also made a personal birthday card just for me. Now that is service. Melia the concierge was also incredible in her friendliness and attention to detail. The room was fantastic with beds being so comfortable. Yes the wall are thin but this hotel is a classic and worth the experience. Thank you team.<//text>

I am a Gold member with SPG and have had a great experience at various Luxury Collection hotels but this experience was the worst that I have encountered with any hotel.  When I arrived at the hotel, I found that I had to cross a picket line to get into the hotel.  When I found that the hotel had been under protest by their hotel staff for nearly a month, I was disappointed that the hotel or Marriott did not inform me of the impact it would have on my stay so I could have made other arrangements.  The noise from the protesters was continuous and loud from 7am to 9:30pm every day.  Because there was very limited staff, many of the services that I expect as standard for a hotel of this caliber were not available.  This stay was a pleasure trip and it was not.</review>

I've been staying at the Palace at least once a year for a decade, and I was reminded during a stay last week why I appreciate it compared to many other properties: the attention to detail.

From the complimentary shoe shine service to the on-request in-room coffee maker (with both excellent dark roast coffee and green tea in single-serving cups), the Palace has thoughtful amenities, even for the frequent business traveler.

The only oddity on this recent stay was the newspaper delivery -- three different papers (SF Chronicle, USA Today, Wall Street Journal) on three different mornings. And a room safe that failed to open when I was checking out, due to a dead battery. But the latter was quickly remedied by engineering, who showed up immediately.

Worth noting :the location is excellent for those coming from SFO and want to take BART, as a BART station is directly outside the doors of the hotel on Market.<//Text>

I cant believe after a 6 year absence from this property (busy with work and stuff. finally got to take a vacation) The staff actually remembered me. I use to stay here a lot and it was great to see familiar faces and so glad to be remembered. Makes this a very special place for me. I was greeted at the front desk by Jenny and Scott. Great reception. It wasn't too busy so we got to chat a bit. Even got some hiking tips. Hiking in San Francisco? Who would have thought. Later that day I saw Taka who immediately said "Hiiiii. Wow its been about 5 or 6 years" aw, she remembered.
Malia from the concierge desk happened to be passing by and immediately gave me a hug and said welcome back. Wow! Im impressed ten fold. Also, got to see Jorge. haha alway so courteous and a great smile.
My room looked new. I think its been renovated and looks really nice. THE BED! OMGeee. Sank into it and woke up the next morning in the exact same position. So comfortable.
I had to enjoy the beautiful Garden Court so sat there in the evening and had a beautiful glass of Wine that was recommended by Andrew(i think... I think Im wrong tho. sorry) Such a nice young man. I actually had 2 glasses with the Steak Tartar and a cheese and cracker platter. YUM! There was a young man on a guitar and I just didn't want to leave. The ambiance was spectacular. So, I went back to have the Grand Tea on Saturday. With Champagne of course. LOVED IT!
ok this is getting long and im sorry but I cant say enough great things about this property. I am also trying to get back in October. A friend told me. You just gotta make the time.
Ill see you all soon and thank you so much for a great experience.< /review>

The breakfast wasn't worth the money, that's why I gave this hotel only 4 stars in total. I was very impressed by the entrance hall and the hotel rooms. The hotel is very clean and hygienic. Although the pool isn't really what it looks like on the photo it's not that bad. The employees were really nice and loyal, especially the concierge was really helpful planning our trip.</review>

The Pied Piper bar is a classic, with special meaning to us (it's where she said "yes!") But over the years the service has gone from slow to abysmal. Three people serving drinks *and dinner* to a large bar crammed full of people on a busy weekend just isn't close to enough. Why do they think it is?

Also, late checkout just doesn't work. There are electronic locks, so the maids could just swipe a card to see if the door is locked. But instead they pound on the door every 15 minutes, and just don't comprehend the notion of having a leisurely Sunday breakfast in bed. After the 10th time (literally) I opened the door and the look on my face evidently got the point across. But by then, the mood was not what we were hoping for. Sigh.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><review>I stayed here for six nights in December and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. I've stayed in about 5 different hotels in downtown San Francisco and this was the first one I've experienced with a genuinely quiet room, without all the noise of sirens from the street. If you're a light sleeper like me, be sure to ask for a room facing the inner courtyard.

The hotel oozes quality and is staffed with friendly, polite employees. Decor is beautiful, celebrating its vintage rather than trying to hide it with modern design, something I appreciated very much.

For once I remembered to pack my gym kit, so got to make use of the facilities, including the pool. All excellent, and if you're a swimmer the glass roof is a treat, especially at sunrise as the skyscrapers surrounding the hotel are lit up.

I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to rebook this hotel. Highly recommended.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Great service! Everyone there was eager to help and quick to acknowledge us all (including my 5 year old). Kid friendly, great pool and facilities and clean! Will stay there again for sure.< /review>

We just stayed for a week at the Palace and it was perfect. The location in San Francisco is convenient for shopping, restaurants, sightseeing--easy access to everything. The Palace itself is a work of art and architecture. The room had everything--a wonderful bed with luxurious linens, a great shower, lots of electrical outlets, a desk, a refrigerator, a safe, bathrobes. The amenities were the best, and everything was clean and neat. All staff were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The San Francisco Cotillion was held during our stay and it was magical to see the wonderful young people in their finery. I highly recommend the Palace.</text>

We just checked in today and the hotel has exceeded our expectations. The hotel is amazing and the staff welcomed us with free drinks after learning of our anniversary this week! Great room and beautiful furnishings. High ceilings too! Definitely recommend!</review>

Loved everything about this hotel except the price and the taxes, I forgot about those 20%% taxes. Room is very clean. Rooms with high ceilings and a lot of history. The staff was was wonderful throughout our stay. Room service came faster than promised during the breakfast rush and was good.< /text>

<gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmapID><review>I want to give this historic and beautiful hotel more stars--but for the nightly room price, the Palace Hotel needs to update their severely outdated rooms. No wardrobe dresser, no HD television, no USB ports and bathroom (shower only) is closet sized. Absolutely bare minimum for $300 a night in a painfully outdated room. However, employees do provide top notch customer service & the Garden Court is something to behold in the Lobby.</review></record>

Staying here is always special, the hospitality and customer service exceeds all expectations. Jerry from the front desk goes above and beyond the call of duty to make us feel like this is our home away from home. Thank you Jerry for being absoulty amazing and making us feel like we are family. It is the little things that you do that make us feel so so very special.</text>

While the exterior and public spaces of the Palace Hotel continue to convey a sense of glamour and quality the guest room experience is anything but. On a recent stay our premium room was drastically under furnished (two small chairs in a vast room which could easily have accommodated a sofa or at the minimum an end of bed divan) and sorely lacking in any sort of usable storage - all that was provided were two old suitcases masquerading as lockers, one of which had a broken close so constantly slammed shut on your hands. 

The bathroom while small was modern and well equipped but we were astonished at the lack of any mini bar or other similar facilities despite the provision of a fridge.

The crowning touch of the room however was the complete lack of any sort of sound proofing against the corridor or adjacent (locked door) room. With a crying infant next door you will not be getting any sleep. If you do manage to fall asleep however the beds are at least comfortable.

Unfortunately I cannot imagine ever wanting to stay in this hotel again unless they really invest in bringing the rooms up to date</Text>

We stayed at The Palace Hotel the first night of our honeymoon. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. In addition to a room upgrade and complimentary breakfast we had a personalized note with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room to celebrate. Key take aways: amazing staff and stay for breakfast (the best!).</review>

<Gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//Gmap_id><text>We selected this hotel because it has an indoor pool & spa, is convienient to public transportation, is historical, and has a beautiful dining room. The spa was always crowded since the capacity was 4, but there was a large sauna to warm up in. Our room was compact (2 doubles for a family of 4) but the beds and bedding were comfortable and the room was reasonably quiet. I think the high ceilings and massivly thick doors help. I enjoyed the tea service with live piano on Saturday - a must if you drink tea. The breakfast buffet was impressive too. We would have loved to eaten every meal here, but it would have been too costly. Great for special occasions.<//text>< response>

Attended a professional event. It wasn't hard to find the hotel as the enterance right on the market. Once inside, it was also easier to get to the event without anyone's help as it had sign posted and only one even was going on the whole floor, although not all the rooms were used.< /Text>

Not only is this hotel exceptionally comfortable, beautiful, luxurious, and completely fabulous, but the staff are wonderful. Lidia in the fitness facility is the most professional, kind, gracious individual. I look forward to my stays at the Palace because of her! And the doormen are incredibly helpful, friendly, and professional. I always go green so I do not have any type of room service! I only stay at the Palace when I'm in San Francisco, which is about every few months!< /Text>

<text>Service needs improvement. I tried to check in early and was told my room wasn't ready but gave my phone number so that the front desk could call me when the room was ready. Well after almost two hours of waiting and having to get ready for an event in the hotel's lobby, I finally went up to the front desk to ask when the room would be ready. At that time, the front desk attendant produced my keys and gave me my room number. I was very disappointed as I should have received a call. Additionally, in the time that my boyfriend and I were waiting for our room, not once did anyone come and offer us water or refreshments during our wait. This is NOT what I would consider 5 star service. The hotel is in a great location and the lobby is beautiful but, unfortunately, I would not recommend this hotel.< /text><Date>1509926400000< /Date><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmapID>< resp>

Hotel was immaculate and well worth the group rate price associated with a large convention. Standard queen double was roomy with little to no noise penetration from the hall or neighbors. Bed area had insufficient outlets and decorated with an overabundance of huge pillows - far too big for sleeping. Why not provide a variety, so that guests can choose the ones most well suited for their physiques? No simple breakfast option was available and this fine hotel had no dinner options. On the other hand, the Pied Piper Bar & Grill food and service was excellent.</text>

<Review>We were so happy to see our favorite front desk person, Scott when we checked in. We have been coming to the Palace since our daughter was a toddler. She is now in her mid-twenties. We were greeted with genuine warmth by Scott and so appreciate the staff at this hotel. The public spaces are beautiful and you can't beat the location. We fly into SFO and take BART directly from the airport to the Montgomery St station and in the blink of an eye we are checking in and off to the museums , theater or to meet friends. We love the Palace. They have earned our loyalty.<//Review><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmapID><user>None<//user></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful hotel in a great location. The staff was over the top helpful during my 7 day stay. I They even sent a seamstress to my room within minutes after I saw I needed my pants hemmed!
The piano player in The Garden Court every evening was amazing!
They things they do need to step up on is the internet speed and connection, not sure why they still charge in 2014. Also, no in-room coffee, again, it's 2014 so it should be a given. It takes 10-15 minutes to walk down to the lobby to get coffee at in the mornings, didn't have the time to spare. At least I had a mini fridge I could keep my two free bottles of water every day. Overall it was a great place to stay.<//Review>

<Text>Room somewhat small and so is the rest room. Please check your bill very carefully as we were considerably over charged. For 1st time in San Francisco, it was in a perfect location to pick up the city tours bus or Uber to locations on the waterfront. You should definitely stay here.< /Text>< resp>

<time>1494806400000< /time><rate>None<//rate><Review>We have stayed at this hotel before and loved it but this time I had asked for adjoining rooms that were not by the street for noise. We got there at check in 3 and where told are rooms where not ready. Okay we went for a walk came back at 5 told are rooms still where not ready. I asked why and was told that the people before us where preferred customers who where allowed to stay as long as they wanted. I ask what about us. They asked if I wanted different rooms. I ask are they next to the street and told yes. We finally were able to get into the rooms at 6 . 

One of the toilets was not working well. They came to look at it but for are stay it did not work well. 

In the morning I called and talked to the manager but he felt I should have taken a different room and that was it. The hotel is beautiful but the staff not so understanding. Maybe if you are a preferred customer you get better service but I was a little disappointed.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

We had a great after Thanksgiving stay. Staff was all very polite. It's nice to be upgraded since occupancy was lower. Beds, linens, towels were super comfortable. Bummer that the pool is out right now.

Check in staff and housekeeping staff was super nice when they saw that we had a 4 yr old with us. It's the little things that makes a stay more personable.

Experienced a little water hammer noise due to older plumbing - historical buildings. Not a big deal.</Text>

One bit however, the maitre 'd in the atrium was not the friendliest and didn't seem "ready" for interaction with the hotel guest.

All in all, we will always stay at The Palace Hotel every time we are in the most beautiful city in the world, San Francisco.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I highly recommend The Palace and will be back.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Rooms were smaller than I thought they would be for the price. They messed up my room reservation, but fixed it and gave me a coupon. Room was missing the iron. Beds were super comfortable. Bathrooms small, but nice.  Common areas of hotel are super nice. Food and bar are decent.</review>< gmap_id>

My wife and I cane to the Palace Hotel for an anniversary getaway. Besides being impressed with the beauty and luxury of this hotel we were also impressed by how friendly and helpful the entire staff was. The excellent location put us close to many adventures we enjoyed and continue to talk about. We are already planning our next visit to the Palace. Thank you all for the great experience</Review>

Fell in love with the architecture of this hotel. Cool vintage look. Comfortable hotel rooms. The hall ways seemed to be a little echoey which I haven't seen before. Adds to the general character of the hotel I guess.< /Review>

<Review>Exceptional staff, communication and gorgeous hotel. I had e-mailed the Hotel Manager, Mr. Sneen. He immediately e-mailed me that night, at midnight! What prompt service! I was informing him that my husband and our friends were heading to SF for a nice getaway weekend to celebrate a birthday and retirement. I had asked for a suite and adjoining room. Mr. Sneen and his staff went above and beyond to accommodate our request. From start the finish, the stay was amazing. The staff was extremely helpful and attentive. The room, lobby and overall hotel were GORGEOUS. I love the historic beauty of the hotel, it truly is San Francisco glamour at its best. The gold plated décor, stairways, beautiful stain glass, marble, lighting, etc immediately transports you back to the gilded age. We weren’t able to check in early, but the room and welcome amenities were well worth the wait. We were surprised twice with delectable desserts and a bottle of wine. The rooms were beautiful and spacious. With my Platinum benefit, we opted for breakfast. We had a lovely breakfast in the atrium was breathtaking. The food was very good and the staff were helpful. We could not have had a better weekend and we look forward to staying again this upcoming baseball season! The staff should be commended for their excellent work.</Review>< Pics>

The Palace was a lovely hotel and quite the experience. The hotel is quite old and the staff do very well to show the historic roots. While riding elevators and walking around the hotel I felt like a passenger aboard the Titanic. The room was fantastic as well with modern amenities including a heated bidet. There was also complimentary coffee and tea each morning.< /review>

<Review>Honestly, its a nice place to stay. It has bad service in regards to the employee's. Not once did anyone ask to help us with our belongings, and at the front desk we dealt with employee's whom were not helpful. I felt judged and treated without respect! This place does not accommodate there guest. I would insist on staying somewhere else with better service. In the end the place wasn't worth the stay.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>The hotel is great! The lobby looks like a real palace and it is very fancy. The staff are very friendly. 

The only thing we feel quite upset about the hotel is regarding the experience at the garden court restaurant. We had lunch there this Tuesday and we were served by a nice gentleman called edgardo. He's very nice and attentive. However, the other server who came to collect the plates was quite rude. We asked for a new folk, in stead of getting us a folk, he stared at us and asked why we need a new one. We said we dropped the folk on the floor, he acknowledged but never came back with a new one. During the lunch, he keeps trying to take our food away while we are obviously still working on our food (plenty of food on the plate). While he was cleaning up next to us, he even hit my head with his elbow. How ever, we didn't hear any words apologizing for it. 

The overall quality about the hotel is beyond expectation still. I would definitely recommend the hotel to friends.< /text>< pictures>

This hotel is more focused on operational efficiency and bottom line and has lost sight of the customer. Upon check in, there was a rate that was $50 less expensive then one I reserved of which all other SPG hotels accommodate, this one didn't. I had to stand in line again on the second day because they only gave me one Platinum breakfast voucher and you have to have one for each day at this hotel. One day returning to hotel, my key didn't work and I had to go to the front desk and stand in line two times to get it working again. Hair on floor in rest room and tub upon first day of arrival, blinds not fully shut for turn down service, piles of trash and recycling left in halls for extended periods of time. Rooms, food, hotel itself is good but service was what you would expect at a Sheraton or 4 points.< /text>

<Review>The room we booked was an interior room, which was quiet but no view. Since we live in the bay area and were just in San Fran for the night, we didn't need much. The room was large and very nicely put together. Love the updated bathroom and decor - very tasteful and still paying homage to the heritage. And bath salts in the bathroom amenities is an excellent touch! Room service was astronomically expensive (we have stayed in 5 star hotels that didn't charge this much). Also, we utilized the hotel parking, called ahead to have them pull the car around, checked out and was out front within 15 min. However, we stood out front for another 35 minutes waiting for our car (we were asked what number we had twice, but nothing came of it) until I got restless and started walking around on the sidewalk, where I found our car parked a little ways down the street. It had been there for ages! And then we got no luggage assistance or apology. Sloppy. They were busy, but...
Overall, the hotel is beautiful and the location is awesome. Service from front desk was good. But lots of little things were not great.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Classic jewel steeped with history, charm, good service and amenities. Pricy, but everyone should try to stay  here a night to complete your bucket list if you are able. Check out the artifacts dating back when Teddy Roosevelt stayed here. An atrium like no other in the United States.</Review>

<Review>Great Hotel, Great Location. Beautiful room and fantastic public spaces. MUCH NICER than the Hyatt Regency! The restaurant was good, but kind of dark. It reminded me of the Ritz Carlton Boston. Dark paneling....You know. The toilet in the room had a heated seat... Nice. The hotel is also easy to get to using BART.</Review></record>

<Text>Although SF is a city with abundant peculiar landmarks, Palace hotel was one of these landmarks and indeed, it was a hotel experience that helped define our SF destination. Strategically located at the center of all, Palace hotel combines history and luxury to comfort and impeccable service. All what you need from a great hotel experience.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>I was excited for my stay at the Palace hotel over the Christmas holidays, including requesting the Santa High Tea for my family. At check-in, the Front Desk agent was very friendly and accommodating, giving a brief overview of the amenities and options at the hotel, including the fitness center and pool which were on the same floor as my room. The lobby was very festive with the Gingerbread house contest and the Christmas decorations, including the huge tree!

The room itself reflects the old decor of the Grand Dame hotels. The fitness center down the hall was well equipped with a nice pool and sauna which came in handy after a long flight. The attendant could not have been more helpful and cheery.

The only major disappointment was at the Tea with Santa where the Hostess forced our table to be reseated behind the Christmas tree as she had given our table to another set of guests whilst we were in line to take a photo with Santa. She did not offer to reseat the second party and return us to the original table. Overall the tea service was average, and certainly not as good as previous Afternoon Tea services at the Palace. Management has assured that this will be addressed.

While housecleaning was good, my unit could have used a check behind the sofa. When I went to retrieve a lens cap that slipped under, I noticed a few bits of garbage behind there.

The staff was very attentive and friendly. The valets and front door staff were exceptionally helpful. Aside from the Hostess, the only other people who were the exception to the stellar staff were the two individuals at the front desk when I checked out. Neither bothered to look up when I was checking out!

Over the years, I have had a chance to stay at some of the nicest hotels in the world, including many Starwood properties. I would stay at the Palace again, but I would not rate this a good, but not, Luxury stay.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Stayed in 2014.

Made the mistake of booking through an external site. Didn't tell us that debit wasn't accepted and we would have to lay down a $200 cash deposit which we had to talk down to $100 as we didn't have the money on hand. The staff wasn't very kind to us after this, treating us with contempt.

The person checking us in even went so far as to imply that my girlfriend was my mom and that we were going to go up to the hotel room to do...things.

We ended up calling Starwood after that little stunt and they gave us half off our next room, which is fine I guess, but still. The vibe I got off this hotel is that if you even look like you're NOT rich, you'll be treated badly. The girlfriend and I saved like hell for this trip for Christmas and we got treated horribly for all that effort.

In stark contrast to the Hotel Carlton which we stayed at recently, they treated us extremely well.

That said, the Palace is a nice looking hotel and it may well have changed since that incident, but I would proceed with caution.</review><userid>103734735635787465490< /userid>< Resp>

An Excellent Hotel to stay for location, comfort and service. 
The down side is the light fixtures: desk lamp's light level is too low and shining right into your eyes when you try to work on your paper works. So is the lower set of light on the mirror in the washroom, the reading light switch above the bed are too high for small built guests, who has to stand up on bed to turn it off after reading in bed.
Bathroom tissues location is also terrible, you have to turn more than 45 degrees to get your tissues, its hard for fat people to reach.

There are also no drawer chest to spread out your clothing when you stay for a few days, your under garments have to go back to your luggage everyday.

Staff are very very friendly and helpful, great place to spend your vacation or overnight stay.</Review>

Second, all the staff couldn't be nicer and helpful. Third, the lobby,bar and restaurant with it's high ceiling, glass dome couldn't be more beautiful. A great Hotel and great experience.

The Christmas Day Brunch in The Garden Court and Grand Ballroom is like a story out of a Charles Dickens novel. The beds were so comfortable and the staff treats everyone with refinement. I'm in room 410 and I could hear everything in the room next door. Taka from the reception was just amazing.< /Review>

<Text>The hotel proved to be a decent stay. It did not "WOW" me by any means. The WiFi connection was not even average and was quite frustrating. Being there on a business trip, connection to the internet was very important. However, a consistent connection was difficult to maintain. The proximity to sights in San Fran and many of the other hotel's ammenities were a plus.<//Text>< user_id>

Overall stay was positive as the staff were helpful and professional. Hotel is nice and rooms were clean. Hotel reservations folks were great as they helped accomodate us with a bigger room and rollaways which was very helpful. This was the positive part.

The area for improvement would be:
1) Food for room service - food was mediocre but to top it off both my daughter and myself found oursleves with some stomach issues (and we both had the burger)
2) TV - was not working correctly on HD channels. Engineering came and fixed it which was a simple reset that should have occurred when they switched software. I guess I would have expected that all TVs were reset.
3) Front desk could be staffed with additional people as we had to wait each time we were there - along with no SPG preferred lane.
4) No turn down one night - not even a knock to see if it was wanted.

In the end, the staff made the stay positive but for a luxury collection the areas where we had issues should not have occurred.< /Text>

<Review>I stayed at this hotel for a conference at the enc of January, and it met all of my needs. The hotel has a very classic feel to it, with a beautiful lobby area and ornate walls and ceilings throughout the conference rooms. The concierge was incredibly helpful in making dinner suggestions and reservations while I stayed there. I only had two complaints about the property. The first was with the gym. It was very small and very crowded at the time I was there. The second was that I had reserved a room with a King size bed, but only double bed rooms were available. At check-in, I was told that the conference rate did not guarantee me the room of my choice, and that I could come back on the second day of my stay to see if they had any King rooms available. As that is more hassle then it would be worth, I declined that offer and kept the double beds. Overall, that is a minor issue and I still enjoyed my stay.<//Review>< user>

<Review>Right from the start the hotel staff treat you special
From the opening of doors at the front entrance to the housekeeping staff that make up the room
You are always greeted with a smile and a knowing that you are home and they care for your well being
I was totally amazed by the size of the hotel and. The attentiveness of the hotel associates.

The concierge staff are amazing and full of ideas of what to do. They take their own experiences and pass them onto you.

You know they care when you get phone numbers for incase situations like getting lost in San Francisco which is possible but thankfully this never happened to me

The front desk and bell staff were also great in helping with things and suggesting what to do around the hotel or city

I had the pleasure of being picked up by their car service - again amazed by the attention to detail that they have.

The room was spacious and I could not hear anything from other rooms

In the mornings you can hear the showers but that is normal from any hotel you stay at

Great job to all - I look forward to my return stay< /Review>< pics>

Wonderful hotel with lots of history. Clean rooms and all facilities you need. The only downside is you have to pay $15 per day for wi-fi in the rooms (its free anywhere else in the hotel) and in this day and age you get this service free in most places.
We enjoyed our stay none the less and would use again if visiting San Francisco.< /Review>

I stayed here last year and had a subpar experience (mostly related to billing and AMEX Plat perks), however, a manager convinced me to try again. I'm glad I did. The two days spent here showed me that the staff and facility are top notch and do actually care to provide wonderful service.

While my room had an issue with the air conditioner, I set it at 65, yet it refused to budge from 72, it still was a reasonable temp to sleep and do a little catch up work with. 

One highlight, the concierge Chinatsu. Chinatsu was able to secure me a reservation for myself and a client at a restaurant that was booked through mid-July...45 days out. I don't know how it was managed, but thank you! I tried to stop by the desk twice and was unable to connect and show my gratitude in person...but thank you very much Chinatsu, you are certainly a gem and a wonderful asset for this hotel!

The conference portion seemed a little subpar...poor audio/video at a couple of the sessions, and lack of food (which may have been the hosting org fault), put a little mark on the experience, but overall, I think the place was excellent and I'll certainly plan future stays here.</text>

<Text>I've been a Platinum SPG member for several years and The Palace is one of my favorites! My husband & I stay here when we go to Giants baseball games (it's a great location for walking to and from AT&T Park) and the staff recognize us and call us by name. They are always very helpful at the Front Desk (Ruben, Laka and the Front Desk Manager) and also the Bellmen (Paul and James). On my recent stay, there was a minor problem with the charge from the Pied Piper which was taken care of with courtesy and fairness. (Unfortunately, my husband's steak in the Pied Piper was delivered too cool and the knives we were given could not cut it very well as it was a bit tough-we noted that to the server but did not get any help.) However, breakfast in the Garden Court was super -- a great selection of hot food and excellent service and refilling of juice and coffee! Anyway, overall, I am always very happy to be at The Palace!<//Text>< response>

<review>Several issues came up: I was billed for the room on departure even though room had been prepaid about a month before. Still trying to get Billing Dept. to return my call. I tried emailing but the stated email address came back three times as "Undeliverable".
Room was shabby: carpet was extremely dirty, entire room needed to be painted, one sconce light in bathroom was out throughout my stay.
I was supposed to get 500 extra points because I declined room cleaning on Sunday, but no extra points credited.to my account.
Staff very friendly. Good location. Good room size. Nice toiletries.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

The hotel is very nicely cared for. The doormen/bellmen staff were very alert and helpful. The room was in good condition and the lobby and both restaurants both looked really good. The concierge was helpful with transportation and food recommendations. I would definitely stay here again given the opportunity and I look forward to other stays in Luxury Collection properties.< /text>

<Review>Traveled to San Francisco for a work conference. The staff was amazing. Because of my early flight arrival, I was worried that I would not be able to check-in early, but the staff went beyond expectations and made sure my room was ready when I arrived. Located in a busy part of town, I initially thought that I would be up all night listening to the traffic pass by. I could not hear a thing from my room! Utilized the concierge desk as this was my first time in San Francisco. The staff did an amazing job at giving me tips on how to navigate the city, sights to see, and wonderful recommendations for eating. I would highly recommend this place to others!<//Review><user_id>None<//user_id><Date>1488758400000< /Date>< response>

<review>I booked through Starwood and thought it would be another downtown SF hotel. I was impressed the moment I walked in. The atrium is amazing and a real focal point for the hotel. One of the nicest bars I've seen in this type of hotel. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet. The overall stay was better than I expected.< /review>< Resp>

OVERALL IMPRESSION: Certainly a Grande Dame amongst American hotels and honorably maintained.

SPG RECOGNITION: Upgrade to a Suite. No in-room amenity. Platinum Breakfast is the full buffet - which is spectacular - in the glorious Garden Court.

THE ROOM: Beautiful and traditional top-floor corner suite with all modern amenities but a classic “Grand Hotel” feel. I loved the large arched and curved corner window looking down on the city.

LOCATION: At the very heart of San Francisco just a few yards from Union Square, SoMA and the Theatre District.

EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS: Surprisingly, the hotel’s highly-touted Japanese restaurant has been closed. This was something of a disappointment because - as it was still appearing on the SPG Restaurants and Bars site a- we had planned to dine there after a visit to the theater. The other restaurant would be closed by the time we got back but the manager, Brian, went out of his way to arrange for us to dine on the restaurant menu in the adjacent bar upon our return. And the meal was just right.

DID NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS: Attention to detail is a make-or-break issue at this uppermost echelon of hostelry and, therefore, where in a lesser property oversights can be easily forgiven, I find it disturbing that here there didn’t seem to be too much effort to get it right. For example, having been advised of my very reasonable arrival time of 15h30, one would think there would have been a greater push to have the room ready. When it was not, the reception clerk simply suggested we “go for a walk” with no gesture of compensation or apology. Although the hotel received a list of special requests, none of them were honored. When I called Guest services for the two Martini glasses which should have been there already, I waited 20 minutes and was brought two tumblers. When I questioned the attendant who brought them, he said the hotel had no Martini glasses! Highly unlikely when it is the home of the Pied Piper Bar - famous for its Martinis</Text>

I just want to recognize the excellent staff at The Palace Hotel. We took a short winter break from the east coast and stayed there from Feb 23-26. The bellhop Jesus was very kind and gave us excellent suggestions of where to sight see and eat. The concierges Jose and Malia also gave us fantastic suggestions on wine tours to take. When we dined at the hotel, the dining room servers Felipe and Amado were also very professional and attentive. We will definitely recommend the Palace Hotel to our friends and family!< /Text>

A worker's union was on strike and I was not notified ahead of time about the reduced services the hotel would offer as a result of the strike before I arrived. Pretty disappointed, as it was my birthday weekend and I had made the reservation a couple months in advance. If I had known about the strike and reduced services in advance, I would've booked another hotel.</text>

Our daughter is a Senior at Academy of Art and the Palace would be our choice if just for convenience and amenities ( Best Spa,Sauna, Pool in City), next to BART Stop and easily walkable and easy taxi to where we need to go. When you add people like Teresa and Scott in Desk and management, Lydia in the Spa it becomes such a pleasure. My wife celebrated her Birthday this visit and by mentioning it we were sent up Chocolate Strawberries and a breakfast tray. There may be newer, hipper properties in SF, but if you appreciate the historical aspects of The City and embrace elegant style, The Palace is the place to stay.<//Review>

<text>Met a large group for dinner and drinks in the lounge. It's upscale leather club chair classic in style. Great cocktail options and mocktails for the less-imbibed. The food was great. Definitely try the Brussels; everyone is trying to make them, but the Pied Piper kitchen gets them right: crisp, with a curried aioli. Great service from the gentleman who took care of us for the evening. Staff is dressed up; place is amazing; atmosphere brings it all together. Top it off with ambiance that is quiet enough to have great conversations with your party. If you're alone, lounge in one of the club chairs, and enjoy some upscale me time.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmap_id></record>

The hotel is beautiful and it located right next to BART, so commuiting is easy. I wanted to give a good rating, so I waited until my second stay. The rooms are very small. The bed is very comfortable, but takes up the enture room. This is the second time I stayed at this hotel and both time the bathroom cleanliness was below standard. Both times, there were hairs on the floor from previous tenants. Found by getting caught in my toes. Gross. This means they don't clean the floors between every tenants. Not worth $500 a night.</review>

<gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmapID><Text>As someone who works in the Bay every other week, I continue to find The Palace with amenities befitting its namesake and service only a family could provide. The Front Desk is always speedy and accommodating. It's nice to be greeted by personable hospitality pros, Ruben and Erica; they make the difficult seem 'Effortless'. I found a personalized birthday letter and plate of treats from Marcus, the Front Desk Manager on my last stay -- Amazing! Lastly, Lidia in the Fitness Center always welcomes me back to the gym, towel on arrival and apple for goodbyes. It really doesn't get any better than that! 5 Stars for the Palace, and many more for the Palace Pros: Ruben, Erica, Marcus, and Lidia! Thank you.</Text>< Resp>

<review>Stayed for work event, GREAT hotel. Amazing decor, superb staff, comfy beds. Only complaint is slightly subpar water pressure in the shower. Hope to come back next time I'm in San Francisco.< /review>< pics>

Our Superior King room was beautiful, though without much of a view. The Reception and Concierge staff were extremely welcoming and friendly. The manager even left a bottle of champagne on ice with flutes and a birthday card in the room on the night of my birthday--very nice!< /text>< Pics>

<gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmapID><Text>I have stayed at The Palace several times, and it is my favorite hotel in the San Francisco area. You can feel the 140 year history of the property throughout the corridors, rooms and spaces of the hotel. Nowhere is that history more prevalent than in the restored Garden Court restaurant - the area of the original porte cochere which was partially destroyed in the 1906 earthquake.

The guest rooms are elegantly, richly, and classically furnished.

Sunday brunch at the Garden Court is the finest around, and well worth the hefty price tag. Same goes for the High Tea on Saturday afternoon.

And the high speed internet works very well, and the other facilities are top rate as well, so this hotel is equally suited for leisure and business travelers to SF.<//Text></record>

The hotel is overly expensive, does not provide value for money - has an extremely poor quality of food and service and housekeeping services absolutely suck!

For the kind of money that they charge, you would expect a seamless experience, but that is not the case.

If you're coming to San Francisco - look for another hotel stay!< /Text>

Once more the Palace went out of their way to treat me very well, acknowledging my Platinum status with a room upgrade and special amenity. Plus, their responsiveness to 2 minor requests were timely and carried out with friendliness and professionalism.
When in SF for business or pleasure, this is a class act place to stay! (And Rueben at the Front Desk is the best!)</review>

They charge a lot for parking, internet, refrigerator, meals. It is San Francisco in summer, though, nothing is much less in that area. That being said, it is a historic place, with amazing craftsmanship that you can't even think about duplicating today. Just amazing and impressive. The breakfast, although pricey, was very well done, and all the service was excellent.<//review>< user_name>

The hotel staff is what made this stay great. Arriving earlier than the rest of my family, I was working at the desk in my room when a woman from housekeeping named May came in. After a brief conversation she left and returned with huge number of towels as there were 5 of us staying in the suite. Since I was working, she also joked about going outside to get me a sandwich so I wouldn't have to work on an empty stomach. Such a nice person.

The hotel concierge was also exceptional, helping us to plan day trips and make reservations all on last minute notice.

The rooms themselves are very nice, but dated, however there is a lot of charm in these rooms. I will say they ran a little on the small side. We had a suite and it very cramped. 2 double beds in a suite is not on par with a lot of other SPG properties I have been to. Nonetheless, the beds were comfortable.

The hotel is centrally located and is an easy walk to the Ferry Building. If you have the chance, the hotel got us a reservation at the Slanted Door at the Ferry Building. It is one of the best meals I have ever mad. Thai food.

Over all a wonderful stay and probably the best staff of any SPG hotel I have been to. Will definitely come back on my next trip to SF.</Text></record>

The Ralston Room was particularly nice, with gorgeous crystal chandeliers along the main aisle of the room. One thing you can't miss at Palace Hotel is the incredible lounge area directly past the lobby. The room is lit from above by skylights and the overall appearance is glamorous and fresh.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>I was at this hotel a few times in 2011 but it's an even better experience as a Platinum member. Overall, this is one of the only hotels where front desk staff seem to be trained on the SPG rewards program and what that means.

I was upgraded to a suite and the room was a very nice corner room that was quite large. It was maintained better than some of the standard rooms I have been assigned to in the past. I had a very enjoyable stay.<//review>< user>

Love, love, love the rooms with the high ceilings. It has an old San Francisco charm. Everything about this hotel was elegant. We had a room facing the back, we even loved the view. Pool in the atrium was beautiful. I WILL stay here again. Location was perfect! A hop, skip, jump from everthing. We walked everywhere. We went to dinner at embarcadero, lunch in union square, ice skating at SOMA. Staff was wonderful & every employee we came into contact with greeted us from the moment we entered the hotel, to the lobby, to the gym, the pool, even leaving the hotel. I've never stayed at a hotel in which we were greeted by every employee. It was very welcoming and special.</Text>

What a TREAT! Amazing service from the moment we pulled up in front of the hotel. We were upgraded to a mini suite, packed with more creature comforts than expected. Service at the Pied Piper and Garden Court was top shelf. The hotel was decorated to the nines, conveying the grandeur of an old-fashioned holiday of times passed.

<review>Went here for the garden court signature tea, and it was OK. I've never had fancy tea like this before, so I'm not sure what I was supposed to expect, but the food was a little disappointing. The fruit wasn't even that ripe. Our server was fantastic though! And I enjoyed the tea I ordered, which was vanilla rooibos.

<Review>Everything was great - beautiful hotel that has survived the 'ages'. Enjoyed the Pied Piper Bar/Grill. Lots of transportation just out the door such as BART, Trolly-Cars, buses, etc.
Really enjoyed Girardelli Chocolate Shop at the corner of the Hotel. Hotel is extremely clean with beautiful furniture in the Lobby area.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Very nice place, but there were lots of little flaws. A fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate, which was a huge hassle. The rooms weren't very soundproof, and we were constantly annoyed by street performers and construction. The service for the hotel breakfast was very inefficient. The wifi in my room hardly worked. Otherwise, my stay was very nice and the service was great. I am overall pleased, but did not quite receive what I expected.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The rooms were clean and really very nice. I have never met more friendly staff at a hotel.  The food is insanely good (I can't recommend the crab benedict enough). Although they are very conveniently located, there isn't a whole lot to do within the hotel unless you like to eat and regularly bathe in money. Seriously, this is the only downside but it's a big one. Everything is very, very expensive. Parking alone is $75 a day, and for what I paid per night for a room, I kind of expected gold-incrusted pillow chocolates or, like, my own harem. Bottom line: I very much enjoyed my stay here and for the exorbitant amount of money I paid for, frankly, just a nice hotel, I wouldn't go back.<//Text>

I have been a long time guest at the Palace in SF and each time I stay I have almost the same experience. The guest rooms are beautiful, the pool area and gym are absolutely gorgeous and the staff is some of the most friendly and accommodating at any property in the world. Despite this, I continue to be shocked each time I stay by the amount of noise generated by the other guests. The walls are so thin that, on our last visit, we could hear the gentleman next door snoring. Any noise in the hallways comes directly into the rooms - including the doors opening and closing every time any guest comes or goes, the cleaning staff carts and peoples' voices. This makes it very difficult to get a good nights sleep. We had to move rooms twice on our last visit, once at 12:30 in the morning, just to find a place with less noise. Each time we moved we encountered the same issue and eventually gave up. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful and kind, they even set us up with free breakfast, champagne and strawberries for the hassle, which was greatly appreciated. However, for the amount we paid per night the amount of sleep we actually got was minimal and the experience was very disappointing. I hope they can work something out because it would be a shame to stop visiting.< /review>

< review>
I have been a Marriott Platinum member for nearly 10 years now and was extremely excited about SPG becoming part of the Marriott family. This was my first stay at an SPG property and was very much looking forward to it. The hotel was beautiful, the room was very nice, and the overall amenities were very good. It is funny, however, how one event can ruin an otherwise pleasant stay. 

I was offered a late checkout of 4:00pm when booking my room which I gladly accepted as my company had booked a conference at the hotel and my meetings were over at 12:00 on the final day. I confirmed my late checkout when checking into the hotel. Upon returning to my room on the final day, however, I found that I was already locked out and had to call security. I wanted to take advantage of rest until my redeye back to the East coast, but was disturbed by consistent knocking on my door at 2:30 by the hotel staff (even though the privacy sign was on the door). I opened to find a surprised employee who asked me if I had "just checked in". I informed her that I had a late checkout and she seemed surprised. 

Upon checking out I relayed my story to the person at the desk who said that my keys must have just stopped working (I said "both of them"). This was clearly a situation of my late checkout not being recognized and/or relayed to the hotel staff and rather than take responsibility for the error, the desk agent simply said that she would speak with the staff - almost as if it were a non issue. That was it. 

If that is the type of accountability and service that is indicative of SPG - especially with such an upscale hotel such as the Palace - then maybe my excitement was a bit premature.</review>

Requested connecting room for my family of 5. when checking in, they said they have arranged our 2 rooms to be next to each other, but not connected. Then, the front desk lady upsold me to upgrade to a suite for $300 more per night as she said the 2 rooms will then be connected. Given we have kids, I said that's fine, and I'll pay for the upgrade. We checked in and went to the rooms... they were NOT connected. when I went downstairs to discuss, there was a huge line which I had to wait again, especially the lady who checked me in wasn't at the counter anymore. I waited 20 minutes to get to my turn, and had to explain everything... then they said my original rooms that were next to each others were taken. & they were wrong about the suite would be connecting... the prior front desk lady lied. & there was NO apology. Just said oh, that was a mistake to upsell you. oh, your original rooms are gone... oh, let me try to help you now.... after 45 minutes wasted, we are back to some lower level rooms.. lame. terrible place... terrible service... the bathtub drain doesn't drain well.... standing water after shower... clearly, old and plumbing not working well. there is a smell from the sink too. might be historical, but cannot see enjoying the stay, especially the service is SO BAD!!!!!<//text>

However, since the refurbishment, I think this hotel has lost this special feeling of being in a "one-of-a -kind" hotel. The design used to be a timeless classic, high-end american luxury. It has been replaced by a very common layout, with unclear inspiration for the furniture and a ugly pattern for the carpet. Of course, the building itself remains magnificent but the design has become so common and not aligned with the spirit of the building.</Text><Rate>None<//Rate></record>

<Text>This is a very nice hotel that in general provided a very nice venue for a conference I was attending, however there were a few drawbacks. First was that the staff member who checked me in was somewhat curt and rude, even though all the other people I encountered were nice, this didn't set a very good tone (was especially unwelcome after a long day of travel). Second is that the internet situation is absolutely horrendous here. Internet is indispensable to every day life now and any modern hotel provides relatively easy access to it. Except the Palace. There is wifi but it's only free in the lobby. And that's OK, I'm fine paying for wifi, but even after you pay the exorbitant rate ($8/hr) what do you get? EXTREMELY SLOW CONNECTIONS. So slow that you can barely refresh your mail. Try doing work on this connection. Further, buying the internet doesn't get you access on multiple devices (you would have to pay for your laptop and iphone separately) and the webpage that you have to use to purchase wifi time doesn't even work on mobile phone browsers.

Business travelers BEWARE this will impact your productivity.</Text>< user>

The staff, location and rooms were all perfect with a special nod to the staff. The staff took great care of my wife and I, the other friends we were traveling with and were always pleasant, friendly and helpful in any situation we had (like directions, ideas etc.) They know how to define “Luxury Collection” in every way, shape and form!

All I have to say is that the next time I’m in San Francisco, I will stay at the Palace!!!< /review>< pictures>

Compared to other SPG properties in the area which I have also stayed at (2 others during this trip alone), the staff at the Palace are always the most genuine and professional. The hotel may be historic but that doesn't mean the quality suffers. My room was well maintained and so was the property. The staff here also does a better job at recognizing SPG status and upgrading.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Hotel is great! It was comfortable, clean, and classy. My only small gripe, and this is no fault of anyone, is that the rooms and bathrrom were a bit small. Not a big deal and I realize there is not much that can be done to 'fix' that. Otherwise, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and I enjoyed my stay. The rooms were compact, but comfy. Thank you.<//Review>< rating>

< review>
Stayed here in March 2013 for a conference. It's centrally located in the city with easy access to transportation. The rooms were clean and it was definitely one of the most quiet hotels I have ever stayed in. The staff was very accomodating. I thought the conference facilities were good. The hotel overall though was a little boring. It's an older hotel and decorated as such. There's no gift shop so if you forgot to pack anything you have to go outside the hotel. My room didn't have a view - looked into the windows of the other part of the hotel. If I was in San Francisco for pleasure rather than business I would choose another, more modern hotel.</review>

My wife and I both travel more than half the year and stay in hotels 75 plus nights or more annually and we stayed here for three nights. I'm also a loyal SPG member when possible and have even stayed in this hotel in the past but I can't recommend because the service in the atrium restaurant area is atrocious. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms are fine and even the Pied Piper bar area has nice service, it's just the restaurant. I had heard this from friends about the place but here's specifically what happened to us. We came at 140pm and had my parents come to meet us for lunch. I politely asked the barman who was behind the bar alone with no patrons in which area to sit so we get service for lunch or tea. He didn't even look up and said "lunch is over at 2" So I said, "ok, what about tea?" He said that starts at 2pm. So I said OK, so if we wait until 2pm we'll get service for tea/lunch/snacks? Still not looking up he just said "yeah". Already a sign we should've just left and gone somewhere else. So we sat down and waited at a dirty table with dirty glasses on it. My parents joined at 2pm and we all sat talking and waiting. At 2:20 no one had yet come to our table (or any others that were now also sitting) so I got up and walked over to the bartender again and asked where the servers were. He said "I think they are getting ready" I said,"I thought the service here started at 2?" and he said, "yes, but I think they are still getting ready". So about 10 more minutes go by and finally a server comes and takes our order. We get our drinks and 2 out of 3 come out wrong. We only get one of the 2 dishes we order and not delivered by the server so no one to discuss with. Then at 3:15 the server finally comes back and she tells us she can order it now for us because when we initially ordered we asked if the dish could be made mild which she explained that was why she hadn't ordered if for us yet, because she had to check with the kitchen, which she did but just never came and told us. I spoke to the manager several times throughout and his excuse to me was "I"m sorry, you caught us when we were changing shifts" I said, "are you open at 2pm or not?" as I would expect ANY NICE HOTEL to be staffed accordingly to WHEN THEY ARE OPEN. At this point the entire atrium area was full of other patrons and all around us we heard the same thing, same complaints, customers leaving and saying "we give up", etc.. so it was the whole place and not just us. We canceled the second dish and didn't order anything else as we didn't have time so they ruined a family reunion and then still only validated my parents parking so we had to pay $30 for their parking for this terrible experience. Again, I would stay there just because the rooms and hotel itself are nice and nice location, I just wouldn't spend a dime or another minute of my time in the restaurant. Note to the hotel - figure out your food and beverage service if you want to be considered a premium hotel. Sad waste of a great place and historic hotel.</Text>

We arrived surprised, to find Marriott workers on strike outside of our “luxury” hotel. We questioned our wellbeing as we made our way through the angry mob. The noise kept us from sleeping. Amenities we listed as unavailable because of the strike. We found trash and cleaning rags left in our room after it had been cleaned. We had to ask for reparations to be made as nothing was offered outright. This experience failed in every way to be what it advertised.<//Text>

The Palace Hotel is old and, at least in my room, it showed. The ironing board wouldn't stand up on it's own, so I had to lean it against a wall to use it. There was a badly cracked tile in the bathroom. There was hook on the wall inside the closet that was pulled out and hanging on by a thread. When I left my room the first morning I left a $10.00 tip for the maid, which is my custom. When I returned to the room later I was dismayed to find that the toilet paper roll had not been replaced, nor was there a backup roll anywhere to be found. When I first arrived at the hotel the toilet paper roll was already half gone, so what was left on the second day was less than a quarter of a roll. By the time I was ready to leave my room the next morning the toilet paper was completely gone and I was using Kleenex. Needless to say, I did not leave a tip the second day.<//text>

<rating>None<//rating><text>Hotel is beautiful and my wife and I checked it out years ago as a wedding venue. We finally decided to stay here on a quick getaway and here is my list of things you should know when booking
(1) Rooms are Small, but acceptable if you get a good price
(2) No drawers in the room so if you unpack a bag you need to put everything on the counters including in front of the TV and if there are 2 people not much counter space left
(3) Walls between rooms are not the thickest
(4) Only mirrors are in the bathroom. But this is probably due to the rooms being so small it is the only place they can fit them. So if wife takes hot showers that steam up the bathroom make sure you get ready first or you will sweat
(5) Pool is great, but there are only 5 lounge chairs. There are hundreds of rooms in this hotel and 5 lounge chairs. There are about 10 other chairs so lets just say they don't want you hanging out at the pool
# 6 - Hot Tub fits 4 adults comfortably if you want to have to make friends. Should be bigger for a hotel this size, especially since they have the room
# 7 - Only 2 people working check in at 4pm on a Saturday for a hotel this size
# 8 - When I was checking in counter agent never mentioned the complimentary coffee in the morning to me though the other agent was mentioning it another guest
# 9 - Was kindly given the room # 666 with no question as to whether this would be okay with me
# 10 - No Security. None. You could walk into this hotel and take the elevator to most guest floors if you wanted to or just walk up the stairs. Only security was around the pool and the gym
# 11 - Gym was very nice. TRX, Free apples, water machine, but the TV on most of the treadmills didn't work.
# 12 - Everything looks pretty, but there were luggage scuff marks all over the walls of our room. However the trim and furnishings were quality. Bluetooth Radio in the room as well which was nice
# 13 - Lastly I booked a "package" that was supposed to get me a complimentary upgrade if available and free wifi in the room. I was not given a wifi code and agent never mentioned an upgrade. When I inquired I was told there was non available though he seemed puzzled why I was asking so beware packages</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>This hotel has a few advantages: the architecture (especially the Garden Court) is superb, the breakfast buffet is large and good, the swimming pool is also very large (especially for a city hotel pool), and it is very well located right on Market street.
I have stayed here by myself and with family many times in the past and was always satisfied with the service. However, this year service has been a catastrophe. I wonder if there has been a change in the upper management of the hotel that could explain that; if this is the case, I'd advise Starwood to let the current manager go...

First, let's talk about rooms and upgrades. As my booking was done through Amex platinum travel, and as a Starwood platinum member, there were 2 reasons to try and get me the room upgrade. While it is based on availability, the Palace has many rooms, and the chance that all rooms corresponding to an upgrade are full is very slim. I traveled on labor day last year and the year before and the Palace was always able to offer me that upgrade, but somehow this year there was no upgrade available at check-in. The young lady at the front desk (it looks like front desk employees have all been changed) told me that there would be something for the following nights if I checked on the following day. I did that... A young guy checked on his computer, and then had to go and see the manager to tell me there was no upgrade available. Either there was something and he should have given it to me, or there was not and he should have said it right away, but why this need to ask the manager?? I suppose the new manager does not like giving the upgrades, and asks all his front desk staff to always check with him so he can deny what customers should have had.
Because we were given a handicap accessible room at check-in, it had a horrible shower that was level with the rest of the bathroom (needless to say, everyone can go into the shower with their dirty shoes..). After being denied the upgrade, we just asked if it was possible to switch rooms (for the same category) to a non-handicap room. The guy checked and saw some free rooms of that category. We did not want to end up in something much smaller, so we asked to see what they had before we could decide to switch or not. Once again, the guy went to see the manager, who didn't want that either.. we would have had to switch to the other room blindly, with the possibility to get into a smaller room!!! In all my hotel stays, I have NEVER seen a manager refuse someone to have a quick look at a room before switching.
If the Palace manager wants to save money by not giving upgrades that people should have (and instead leave the room empty in case someone decided to suddenly check-in..), they should realize that the faithful customers who won't bring their business here again will cause a much bigger loss of money... If the manager also does not like giving upgrades, he/she should make sure to drop out of the Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program...

Second, breakfast service. While breakfast is good, many people (like my family and I) have coupons for free breakfast (with Starwood or Amex) and that changes the quality of service... Before we were even served coffee, the waiter (whoever that was, it was the same problem every day) asked if we were to bill it to the room or pay with coupons. Service (tip) is included with the coupons, and needless to say the waiters know that and if they know you have coupons, they won't go out of their way to help you. Why would they do it, when they can pamper people who will give them a big tip, and they know that however poor their service is, they will get the same amount of money from you?.. It was very unpleasant to have the waiters come back regularly during the breakfast to ask about the payment method, while family members were waiting forever to have their coffee cup replenished....

Third, room service. This is the first hotel were I was told that emptying the minibar (so we could put some water in it) would cost us $25!!! Other places send someone (to whom you'll give some tip) for free... Then the cleaning of the room was not great. Some papers (used medical pill wrapping) that any good maid service would have trashed were left on my bedside table day after day..We never heard the vacuum cleaner while walking in the corridors while the maids were taking care of other rooms (with the door open).

Fourth, valet parking. It felt like here again, the hotel had fired half the staff compared to the previous years. It took forever to retrieve the car each time we wanted to go out, because valet staff was very much reduced to one or two people.The garage is just opposite the hotel in a small alley, so it's not a distance problem... This is very frustrating when you'd like to continue visiting the many places this city offers to a tourist!

Fifth, the renovation. While I liked the very classic style before the renovation, I don't mind the new modern style of the rooms. However, the bathroom is worse than before, with almost no place to put toiletries around the sink. One improvement though is the high faucet which allows one to wash one's hands without bumping into the sink as was the case before renovation.

With all these issues, the Palace managed to lose a customer who used to come here year after year. I'll miss the Garden Court, and hope that Starwood will quickly realize that if they don't change the way the hotel is currently managed, it will soon run into trouble...<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>The location is great and the historical details are quite interesting. I expected a higher lever of design, fabrics in the room. The bath is small, as one would expect from a historic building. The concierge and doormen staff are very good. But, at a Luxury Collection I would expect more friendliness and "may I help you?" and greetings from all staff, including housekeeping.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

The Palace deserves its name! Understated elegance, beautiful decor, class and unbelievably helpful staff! My husband and I enjoyed our stay tremendously! Room was beautiful, bed so comfortable - and such character! We're so used to hotel rooms that are just THAT - hotel rooms! This was an experience....can not wait to return!</Review>

Once again The Palace comes theough with a great family weekend. This Memorial Weekend was filled with so many family for our daughters Graduation from Academy of Art.Thanks so very much to Lydia, Sam, Teresa and Scott for helping make the Daughter's Grad weekend a success. This tray was beautiful and the way my 88 year old Mom was cared for made it even more special.Will be back soon.

Best Regards,

Richard Lindroos

Check in was not a good process, Starwood preferred is not clearly delineated and at 3PM our room was not ready. We were given a free cocktail and said we would be notified, but 2 hours later we were back in line.
Service was good, but a bit inconsistent. Overall a nice place to stay!<//text>< name>

As an SPG Gold member, I was upgraded to a corner Deluxe Suite of over 600 sq. ft. for our 3-night stay. The suite was well-kept, clean and very comfortable with lots of extra amenities.

The hotel location was the best as we needed to travel from San Fran Airport. The BART station entrance was right outside the hotel on Market Street. It's really easy to travel to all the famous attractions using the MUNI pass by bus, cable car, streetcar and subway.

The front desk, concierge and bell staff were all very helpful. Just one tiny bit of discomfort: the pool water was too cold and the very small whirlpool could only accommodate 4 people, but they were both well-maintained. Occasionally, we could hear the police sirens at night but it's typical staying in downtown hotels in a lot of US big cities.

Overall, my husband and I really enjoyed the grand luxury of The Palace and we would definitely stay there again.<//Review>

Beautiful classical and historic hotel, great location near Financal Disrtict, Union Square, Chinatown and SoMa. But the service is not up to the standard of other Luxury Collection properties world wide. Not sure why its even in the category other than the historic factor. It's too big to offer personalized service. Inconsistent delivery by staff. For the most part staff very courteous but its just lacking that extra touch of luxury you experience at other LC properties in Europe and Asia. I would return because of the location but not with the same level of expectation. As a Platinum member didn't feel special or recognized. Front Desk just went through the motion. Beautiful dining room but breakfast service lacked attentiveness. We sat there for over 10 minutes without any offer of beverages. Finally went up to the buffet we could have left and the servers would have never noticed.<//review>

<text>Hello,

I wanted to recognize your valet staff as being one of the best I have ever dealt with. James, Jorge and Norman always make a special effort to make me feel welcome and are always helpful and cheerful. Jorge was able to secure a ride for me to the Ritz for a meeting, without me even asking.

Again, they are a great group and I have enjoyed their service through the years.

Room #1 (room 505): 11:30pm, freezing cold, turned up thermostat, 12:00am, no change in temperature, called front desk, engineer #1 came and fixed it and said to give it 20-30 minutes, 12:30am, no change in temperature,1:00am, engineer #2 came and fixed it, 1:30am, no change in temperature, requested new room, 1:35am, brought new room key to me, repacked my bags to move
Room #2 (room 511): 1:45am, went to new room, key did not open door, went down to reception, gave me another room
Room #3 (room 505, adjacent to Room#1): 1:50am, room was freezing, turned up 
thermostat, 2:05am, no change in temperature, requested new room, 2:10am, brought new room key to me
Room #4 (room 681), 2:15am, took luggage to new room, key did not open door, went back down to lobby, front desk attendant came up with me and used master key to let me in room, temperature was a decent 72 degrees, I turned it up to 75 since I was very cold and got to bed about 2:30am. Got up at 7:30am to work. Room was 71 degrees which was fine but still not where I had set the thermostat.
10:00am, checked out, never to return!
Later that day: received apology letter and the manager issued me 3000 Starwood points (nice gesture but totally inadequate for a miserable stay and an exhausting next work day)</Text>

<text>This hotel has survived earthquakes, depressions, and wars. And it has been lovingly updated for the needs of people today without sacrificing the beauty and history of the building. Even if one doesn't stay here it is an experience to eat breakfast, lunch or brunch in The Garden Court. Or have a drink in the Pied Piper Bar (or a meal). It's location is convenient for going to the theatre, opera or ballet. Public transportation is accessible (we come by train/BART). The Palace is our favorite place to stay when we come to San Francisco.< /text>< Response>

<review>I had stayed at this hotel once in the past, and was surprised to find that both I and my roommate were notably allergic to the room.

I noted this fact in a previous review and was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by the hotel staff apologizing and offering a complimentary nights stay in the future.

I took them up on this offer last weekend when I was in town for a wedding and was impressed by the responsiveness and attentiveness of the staff. They even left a nice note in my room wishing me a nice stay.

Additionally, I did not encounter any of the issues with allergies that I had on my previous visit, and, in fact, slept quite well.</review>< pics>

It is nice that there are some things that you can ALWAYS count on. Excellence at the Palace is one of them. From the moment you walk in the door to the second you leave, it is a quiet, luxurious, comfort knowing that your stay will be comfortable, clean, and well done. My only gripe is that the curbside staff has been consistently lacking my past three visits. When I arrive in my car, I am usually ignored by the staff until I have piled out of the car and uloaded all of my own luggage. The valet is just not at par with the rest of the hotel experience. When they had my car curbside at checkout, the same thing - I had loaded all of my luggage before they had time to help me. Valet is costly, even for the city, so I would hope for a good experience. Once you get in the door, though, it is extraordinary every time.</text>

<Review>Overall I like the Palace Hotel and will stay again. The location is ideal for me and I like the history of the hotel (and the breakfast room!). The staff is also friendly and helpful.

However it really is down at the heal. The carpet needs replacing both in the public areas and in the rooms. The elevators are slow. The furniture in the rooms is quite beaten up and stained. It badly needs freshening up.

The standard room I had is quite small. I'd prefer a more standard hotel room with a full size bathroon. But as a single traveller I'd be happy to put up with a smaller room if what was there was better done, taking account of the size and layout of the room.< /Review>< GmapID>

I've been to SF many times and also usually stay here each trip. It's nice to see the friendly staff have remained friendly and dedicated and that the hotel management continues to keep up the hotel to the level of a luxury property. 

Thank you to Nina Fagaraz,the Front Desk Manager, who graciously assisted after a miscommunication regarding an upgrade suite night.</Review>

< Review>
Have stayed many times at the Palace. Having just stayed at another hotel prior to my arrival at the Palace, I was especially struck by the lack of friendly staff. The concierge was unfriendly, whenever we entered the hotel it was like the front desk, the porter or whomever was milling around averted our eyes, disinterested in welcoming us. Same was true in the restaurant. Very unfriendly. There were exceptions - a few warm 'hellos' from those cleaning the rooms and a couple of door men - but otherwise we wondered who was setting the tone of the staff.< /Review>

Great location conveniently next to shops and transportation. We had the standard room and the tall ceilings, color scheme made it spacious / luxurious. Staff was very helpful. The pool was not really heated and when we brought it up, we were heard and the maintenance team came right away. The Pied Piper restaurant did not adhere to our standards when it took about an hour for our order and to top it off, it was incorrect!
Overall, we had an excellent time and would definitely go back to the hotel.</text>

Overall the building was very nice but I wouldn't recommended this for folks looking for a place to stay or groups hoping to hosts events. While the hotel itself feels massive and has a very elegant lobby, it had a number of problems.

Cons:
- I have no idea what the housekeeping folks did to the toilet, but see my attached picture for a first hand view of my 'freshly cleaned' toilet :(
- 8-8:30am Housekeeping visits.
- Stains/etc on the fabrics (shower curtains, bed sheets) left the place feeling pretty dirty.
- I guess I didn't intend to spend a ton of time in the room, so the extra space for sitting/deskwork wasn't appreciate while the cramped bathroom was an annoyance when getting ready for the day.
- For the rates they charge for internet, it was really unreliable/slow. I guess they probably give it away to most folks that stay here (myself included), but I experienced constant disconnects/resets and generally very slow traffic that was nowhere near the advertised rates.

Pros:
- The dining staff seemed really friendly and concerned with their work.
- The guest services staff were also really friendly and followed-up on requests.
- In the rooms there were plenty of outlets and USB ports

The kindness of the staff I interacted with was reassuring, but overall this member of the 'luxury collection'  definitely fell short of its name.<//Text>

The service was rude and appeared overwhelmed. We had to switch rooms due to being woken up at 7 am due to the protesters outside. They said the would provide compensation ($100) and spent an additional 30 min during check out reminding them of this at check out. They didn’t communicate between each other.</Text>

I wanted to state that I was very unhappy with the Internet Service in the rooms. It was extremely difficult to do any work as the connection went in and out. And without a hard wire connection it was just useless.

If this will be the state of the Internet I may have to reconsider staying at The Palace for business trips in the future. We hope you can fix or provide another solution for your corporate guests.

Also I room-service ordered a MEDIUM NY Strip steak for my dinner and it came near WELL DONE and tough. I was just hungry by that time (it was nearly 9 pm) that I just ate it. Everything else was great but the breads could be warmed up if you'd like a suggestion.< /Review>

<Review>I was shocked at how such a beautiful historic hotel could have such terrible sound attenuation. I could hear people talking in the next room quite clearly each night and the housekeeping staff yelling at each other in the corridors all day. I have stayed here several times but this will be my last since it seems to have gone down hill. It is too bad because it is a convenient location.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmapID></record>

<date>1467590400000<//date><resp>None< /resp><Text>I was quite excited to stay at this hotel, but we got in much later than expected, and the staff ruined my evening. We pulled up to the hotel. There was one valet, and four cars waiting to be moved. We pulled our own luggage out of the car, dragged it into the hotel because he would not let us take a cart, then we sat and watched while he moved other cars, and left our car running in the streets of San Francisco at midnight. This went on for 15-20 minutes. I was furious.

While I was checking in, Someone put our luggage on a cart then put it in a line of other carts to be taken up to the room. The time to delivery was about 30 minutes. I was exhausted, and just wanted to go to bed. I wanted to take my own things so I could move on with my night. He said fine, but I had to leave the cart. We said it would take 5 minutes and we would bring the cart back. He said no. So here we are, exhausted at midnight, dragging 4 bags and a cooler between the 2 of us in a tux / dress and heels, in a Category 6 hotel we paid a small fortune to stay in - while a bellman, a valet, and 2 check in people stared at us while we struggled to get up to our room. All the while a car is sitting in the road waiting to be taken. 

I was in shock! It's unfortunate, because the room was awesome. It was comfortable, beautiful, ornate, luxurious, and the heated toilet seat was to die for. I can imagine how awesome this stay would have been if the staff cared at all. We were upset enough that we left fairly early the next day, and didn't really get a chance to see everything they had to offer there. Huge disappointment overall!< /Text><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmapID>< userid>

We stayed at the Palace the night before, and the night of, our marriage ceremony at SF City Hall. We were upgraded to the most amazing suite, with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries awaiting our arrival, a congratulatory note from the staff, and service that was above and beyond our expectations. We chose the Palace for its convenient location and were swept off our feet by their incredible graciousness, kindness, and the classic beauty of the hotel. I couldn't be happier or feel luckier to have chosen this hotel for my special occasion. Thank you, thank you!!!</text>

My wife and I stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary, and the staff were wonderful, especially Pierre at the front desk. We were very pleasantly surprised by a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries waiting in our room, and were also upgraded to a room with view with late checkout at 4 PM. The room was small, but quite luxurious, and the pool and fitness faciliites were large and well-maintained. The location is perfect, right near Union Square and the Financial District. Would stay here again without question!</text>

My wife and I were very impressed overall with the hotel decor and staff friendliness. I will say that we did not start off feeling that way about the staff. Upon arriving at the hotel, we got in a line to check in. There were 3 people behind the front desk and the line moved fairly quickly until we were next up and no one was behind us. We then waited, which I'm sure was not that long but when you're holding bags, seems a lot longer. Then the front desk clerk says, without looking up, I can help the next person. There was no one else in line. . . I thought it a bit rude. Not a good way to start the stay. However the wait staff at the event more that made up for the front desk. Overall we had a great time and would definitely recommend the hotel again.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Our family spent 4 nights at Palace hotel. We absolutely enjoyed our experience. I stayed over 170 nights in SPG hotel in last year alone. So I had seen a lot of rooms.This hotel is a hidden gem! The property is a beautifully maintained historical building. However, the room is very well updated with modern utilities. We never felt we stayed in a 100_ years old hotel. The location is excellent, close to financial district and Union Square. The best part of palace Hotel is the staff: we encountered amazing reception, wonderful valet and helpful room service team. My congratulation to the management team!<//Review>

<Text>I checked in and received a nice welcome from the desk agent, but no upgrade from the room booked. The room was clean and very comfortable, with Gilchrist and Soames product in the bathroom and 2 bottles of complimentary water. The hallways are very noisy and I could hear clear conversations coming from adjoining rooms. Soundproofing here is an issue and was disruptive of sleep. My main concern had to do with the lack of cofeemakers in the rooms. The hotel has elected to put out a coffee cart, which is promptly removed at 10 am - none of which was explained to incoming guest. When I returned for coffee, it was gone and I called guest relations. I got the obligatory tart "sorry" from the male agent, along with a suggestion I could order room service (at ridiculous prices). At this price point, the coffee should have been offered complimentary all morning, and it detracted from the ambience of the hotel. The location can't be beat, and it is literally right next to the Montgomery Street BART and Muni station. Other than the location, I can get more for my money (and my Starwood status) elsewhere.<//Text>< Pics>

This was the second time that I stayed at the Palace Hotel. I chose this hotel as it is centrally located and has a beautiful indoor swimming pool with a glass roof.

The room was spacious and comfortable. The reason I gave 2 stars for room cleanliness is that I spotted hair (not mine) on the bathroom floor when checking in. The following days the room was properly cleaned.<//review>

<text>I love the traditional aspects of this hotel. It is lovely and the staff is as professional as they come. It is perfectly situated by BART and Muni entrances right outside the door. Lovely Christmas decor!!! The only reason I did not give an excellent for facilities is that it did not provide a bathrobe.< /text>< name>

For the price you would think the place could be nicer. We arrived at 2:30 for a 3pm check in and none of the restaurants were serving food....ok on a busy holiday weekend.
Room service was great and the staff who delivered it were the BEST. The Palace should be proud of the room service staff and their wonderful customer service.<//text>

<Text>We have been coming to this hotel for years. The staff is lovely & the property beautiful & historic. We love that we can get off our flight @ SFO, take the BART from the international terminal & be at the hotel in 30 minutes. Perfectly situated for getting around the city & into the East Bay.

<Review>In the last 20 years I have been to San Francisco uncountable times for business and meetings staying at that many hotels. This is the best visit I have ever had.

If I didn't stay at the Palace Hotel this would have been just another of the uncountable visits. At the Palace Hotel I met Debbie Lew at the Concierge Desk where I simply needed a postage stamp. I had the weekend free and Debbie helped me have a fantastic weekend which translated to my most memorable San Francisco stay. The hospitality of the Palace Hotel did not stop at Debbie. Debbie organized my stay. The people working in the memorable Garden Court were first class. Check-in was smooth. The people cleaning the rooms were very caring and courteous. I have stayed at a lot of Starwood properties in San Francisco and this was the best.< /Review><Date>1414454400000< /Date><user_name>GentleJohn< /user_name></record>

The staff was very friendly, the room (although a bit on the smaller side than most hotels) was clean and well appointed, the indoor pool was perfect for my son to enjoy, and it is in a good location. Can't wait to come back and enjoy another visit and breakfast in the Garden Court restaurant.< /Text>< pics>

<name>Catalina66< /name><time>1360454400000</time><Rating>None</Rating><Review>We booked last minute through the Starwood website and got a great rate. We were pleased to receive an upgrade to a Junior Suite upon check in with a City View. The rooms are always beautifully appointed, with luxurious bedding & robes and the complimentary water bottles are something we really appreciate. A new addition to the room is the Keurig coffee maker, which is even more convenient than the complimentary coffee in the lobby. We enjoyed some great cocktails and the AMAZING truffle fries down in the Pied Piper bar, which was bustling on a Friday evening. We had a rather surly man expediting our food, but our waitress was friendly and efficient. WIFI is an extra cost, which didn't affect us, but would have been more problematic if our kids had joined us. Also, valet parking has skyrocketed from $44 three years ago to $59! I had anticipated this and chose to park in the garage around the corner, which is only $25 for 24 hours. San Francico is an expensive parking city, so I can't really fault them for this, particularly as the valets are SO helpful and omnipresent and really work hard if you do choose to valet your car. Overall, it is our favorite property in the City and we can't wait to go back!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>Me and my sister stayed at the Palace Hotel for two nights during easter and we had a great time! The historic hotel in the middle of SF is a perfect spot for exploring the city. The location felt safe and quiet even though it's just a few minutes away from the busy Union Square and the many shopping malls. The only thing we were disappointed with was that there was a lot of kids in the swimming pool in the evening, making a lot of noise which was disturbing when you want to relax after a day walking around the city. Maybe restricting the hours when kids are allowed in the swimming pool could make it more suitable for guests who want's peace and quite. Overall we were really impressed by the comfort of this hotel!<//Review>< Rating>

<Rating>None< /Rating><Review>There were problems from check-in to check-out. I booked the hotel as a platinum AMEX member, but the hotel did not have that noted. The gentleman that checked me in told me repeatedly that the room could not be upgraded for any of the 4 nights of our stay. He also promised the room would be a king, it was a double, and said our welcome amenities would be delivered right away, they weren't. I checked with the front desk manager (Ron) the next day and he moved us to an upgraded room for the last 2 nights. Upon checkout, the receipt did not reflect the special rate my reservation was made under. I had to clear that up with the front desk.
I stayed at The Palace a year ago, and my experience was very positive. Sadly, this time few things went well. I will not stay here again.< /Review>< Pics>

Check your room rates.  This Hotel will give you the worst room available at the highest rate.  Breakfast is abysmal for an exorbitant price.  Front desk reception is unhelpful.< /Review>

This is the most stunning hotel in all of San Francisco, perhaps on the entire West Coast. The Centercourt at the Palace Hotel is something you should not miss if you’re visiting San Francisco. There’s a lounge in the café go for a drink or some lunch, it has the most amazing staying glass atrium ceiling in any hotel that I’ve been in for years and years.
One of the best things about this hotel is that the staff is top notch.</Text>

I've been to the Palace a few times for brunch and it's always amazing! The food is delicious and the setting is absolutely gorgeous. I've stayed in the hotel once and given that it's a historic hotel the rooms are small but still fancy.< /Review>

<Review>Previous stays at the Palace have been fine but from the minute we pulled up to the front of the hotel until checkout (and not including that which was fine), we were disappointed. First, there was a bellman talking on the phone rather than offering to help us with our bags. Then the woman who checked us in did nothing to make us feel welcome and despite the fact that we have been loyal Starwood members, gave us what had to be the smallest room in the entire hotel. By the elevator! This was a huge disappointment. Then when we went to breakfast yesterday, we discovered that we could not order from the a la carte menu and were told to go to the Pied Piper lounge where we could do so. The Pied Piper was locked up tightly. We ended up ordering room service and the cart could barely fit into the room we'd been given. Very disappointing stay overall. You can do better.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>We have mixed emotions about this place. It's a bit dated, though still comfortable. Not all electrical outlets worked. Black water came out of shower head. Responses were good and problems fixed. Managers (sorry I don't have the name of the man who told us he was the overall manager - didn't call himself G.M., nor that of the lady who helped us with Starwood points issue. Restaurant worth stopping by just to take a look at it. Food ok; service there erratic. We would stay there again.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Great hotel with a grandiose architecture. Big room with great amenities. The location is great too. Within walking distance to most tourist destinations. Food is surprisingly good for room service. Granted I only had the late night menu of burger and salad. The breakfast buffet is also surprisingly good with a decent selection of food that is actually cooked properly. The only qualm I have is that they do charge you for the internet.</Text>< date>

From the moment we walked into the lobby of the Palace, I knew our short 24 hour stay would be one to remember. The absolutely gorgeous display of flowers in the main lobby looked like botanical garden display. Lush and lively, the colors added to classic décor of the lobby.

Check-in: The Platinum/Gold SPG line was short, there was only 1 person in front of us. We were promptly checked in within minutes. 

Lobby/Common Areas – with so many new hotels that have gone under renovation, I love that even after the major upgrades last year, the Palace has kept it’s timeless beauty. The Garden Court and GC Lounge Bar have been refreshed with hues of greys and cream. The gorgeous crystal chandeliers and magnificent glass ceilings have all been maintained meticulously.

Room: I had used a Suite Night upgrade and was upgraded to a Superior Suite. But, since we were starting our Anniversary tour with SPG (we spend 2 to 5 weeks every summer with SPG to celebrate our Anniversaries and birthdays) and we were also hosting another couple, I had requested something special for our special day. Casey, Assistant Director of the Front Desk, delightfully upgraded to one of the newly renovated Palace Suites. We loved every inch of the suite. 
Our room was a corner suite that overlooked Market Street. Each window had a small seating ledge where we could sit and watch the world go by. Market was lined with Pride flags, which was such a nice sight to see. The living room was furnished with modern and chic décor. We loved the chandelier and art that graced the walls. Our bedroom had a large King poster bed and a chaise lounge in front. The bathroom had double sinks, a deep bathtub and a separate stand up shower. The bathroom amenities were plentiful and when we needed more toiletries, housekeeping was quick to bring them up. I love all the Gilchrest and Soames toiletries – all very luxurious. Our friends stayed in the fold out sofa bed. For a sofa bed, it was quite comfortable. 

Anniversary Welcome – We were greeted to an array of chocolate covered strawberries and a delectable bottle of Chandon, extended tirage. We also were given 2 handwritten note cards to wish us well. 

Service – I cannot give enough kudos to the Palace Staff. The front desk staff were kind and assisted when they could. I would like to highlight one particular staff member who has continually made our stays so special – Casey – Assistant Director. Casey has helped us in the past and never ceases to amaze me with his level of professionalism and how he goes out of his way to ensure our stays are the best they can be. He secured our upgrade and lovely welcome Anniversary greeting. When we realized we had left our wine carrier with a very special 2006 Justin Isosceles in our room, I reached out to Casey. It was found and will find it’s way back to us. From start to finish, Casey and the Palace staff could not have been more helpful. We had a little glitch with our breakfast reservation and the use of our Platinum Amenity (breakfast in the Garden Court hotel). It didn’t end up getting worked out where we could have breakfast, but I was able to ask for a swap out of the breakfast for drink coupons (Gold Amenity). FYI – breakfast ends at 10:30am on Saturdays and Sundays, a little early for us, but lovely if you are an early bird. 

Pied Piper – We love the new and improved bar. It kept it’s classic look, but is nice and shiny now. The bartenders made excellent craft cocktails. I highly recommend a Manhattan and a French 76 (75 with vodka).

Thank you again for yet another fabulous SPG stay. We can’t wait to continue celebrating in Mexico and San Diego over the next few weeks with SPG.<//Text>

Overall average. My review is for afternoon tea. Service was poor. I had to ask my waitress twice to clear some items off my table and each time it took a very long time to get her attention. The food tasted good but the bread was dry. Great ambiance as the afternoon tea was in Garden Court, which is beautiful, and there was also a pianist that played beautifully. However, food matters most to me, so I would not come here again on my own initiative.< /Review>

<review>Unimpressed. I’ve stayed in many hotels in San Francisco, the greater California area and around the world. When I first arrived I found the front desk unhelpful they simply asked for my credit card, gave me my key and told me my room number. She told me nothing about the hotel, it’s amenities and restaurants or surrounding neighborhood. Extremely disappointing. Then that night my guest and I ordered late night room service, the following morning we were both sick. Beware of their food.<//review><user_name>SAllen< /user_name>< rate>

The Palace Hotel is beautiful, and more than comfortable - the rooms I had felt luxurious. The hotel itself has been cared for with pride. Because it was an anniversary, I received a wonderful upgrade to my rooms which I will always remember with joy. The Palace employees were unfailingly friendly and helpful; a better welcome cannot be imagined. I would recommend the Palace Hotel without fail to anyone who wished to make their stay in San Francisco special. The odd little lapses were small: slippers but no robes in the closet, paper coffee cups instead of ceramics, room service without a condiments caddy, housekeeping that didn't include replacing wine glasses, bath salts and a few other items.</Review>

<review>I've forgot a fire tv stick in my room when I checked out at 9am. When I called at 2 asking where it was, my room had already been cleaned and it was gone. To add insult to injury, I wasn't even able to use it since the HDMI ports of the TVs are blocked.

Lastly, it's really expensive for what it offers.< /review>< gmapID>

Our first impression was very positive. The entrance and main lobby was gorgeous. The staff checking us in and out we're also kind and pleasant. At check in we had requested one of the beds have foam pillows and one have feather pillows. Unfortunately we had to call two more times and did not get the pillows till almost 11pm. Once in our room I was very surprised to see how dingy and dirty our bathroom was. Dirt in the corners, a film in the tub and the floor had hair between the tub and toilet...yuck! Lastly when we went to the bell check desk to pick up our luggage, we stood in line for over 16 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. I had even inquired with the front desk and they asked us to please be patient, someone was coming. I am a patient person but to not even be acknowledged after 16 minutes does not speak od quality service, much less luxury. Very disappointing overall.< /Review>

Had a two-day ricochet through SF, and chose the Palace in the hopes that this Luxury Collection property would give me a little bit more than the Spartan-cool comfort I'm used to at W properties. The staff made the experience.

Points of note:
- Warm and friendly staff upon check-in, and throughout my stay.
- A Concierge that could teach classes in resourcefulness and suggesting "just the thing you're looking for" in area dining.
- Very comfortable beds (beware if you think you're just going to take a 30-minute nap).
- Location, location, location!
- Kyo-Ya. Go ahead - try the restaurant in the hotel. You just might thank me.

Protip from a hyper-active New Yorker up at 6AM on a Saturday - order room service coffee/breakfast. Nobody else nearby will be open to serve you.<//review>

We were a family of 4, including 2 babies. The palace was not a good choice for us, we changed hotels for a more child friendly hotel.
The room was too small for us and too dark. We got a crib but had no place for our 2 years old. she slept on the floor.
I must say that the worker at the reception was very efficient and understanding.</review>

<review>If you are looking for a luxury hotel, keep looking. While the hotel is updated it lacks any luxury amenities beyond its facade. No mini bar in the rooms, no respect for the do not disturb sign and all around the least luxurious Category 5/6 hotel Ive stayed at with Starwoods. They also don't upgrade Gold guests even if they have rooms to upgrade you to...

You'd think after I requested to be moved rooms twice due to some unknown haunting noise coming from the walls of the 7th floor they'd have upgraded me for the inconvenience but you would be wrong if you thought that.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

We stayed at the S.F. Palace hotel over the Christmas weekend. It was the most special experience for our family. The Staff is very helpful and accommodating. The rooms were beautiful and the location couldn't have been better. The indoor pool was great as was the fitness room which my husband & I both took advantage of. All our family agreed that this was the best Christmas experience we have ever had. Thanks you!</text>

<Rating>None<//Rating><Text>Check in slow, not enough front staff, more bell people and security than check in staff. If you're into people cutting in front of the check in line to complain about their view or size of room and the front desk considers them a priority, this is the place for you. If you like being eyeballed by security every time you walk in the hotel this is the place for you. If you have to use the restroom in the lobby and need to search out an employee to get the code to get in, this is the place for you. If you have had a couple too many and the manager of the Pied Piper Bar is a jerk, as well as his bartenders are, this is the place for you. Using SPG Points? expect nothing but a lousy view and a small room. Every time I've used SPG Points to stay here as a Gold Member I've received a substandard room. Will not be using points or money to stay here ever again.</Text>< Pictures>

This hotel is beautiful but they gave me no platinum upgrade at all. I spent almost $400 on a hotel room and booked in advance. They had plenty of time to upgrade me. The Four Points hotels sometimes give you better treatment! Surprised for a five star hotel.</Review>

<time>1552059444960</time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>PROS: could location but I guess pretty much everything in San Francisco is. Relatively renovated rooms and bathrooms although the hotel itself is a typical old hotel with very cheap renovations, lacking any decent artwork, upgraded common areas, for example room has very cheap lighting.air filters and intake in the room or a filthy dirty and when I call to maintenance to change the filters one of the two filters in our suite was missing, no big shocker there.  very good restaurant staff and service, decent buffet but like most Marriott properties overpriced.

CONS: I now clearly understand why this property was $261 a night when all the other nicer category properties in San Francisco we're $600 - $700.  Upon arrival not a single bellman or employee outside nor even inside the entrance doors to help with v heavy bags as my wife and our 11 year old daughter push them up the ramp. shockingly the Bell desk was immediately in front of the entrance door and the man sitting there never even bothered to look up much less get up and help. The woman behind us exactly the same. We took our own backs for the room, not a single offer by anyone including reception to help with bags.  Absolutely astounding that Marriott nickels and dimes their Platinum member is by giving continental breakfast and charging for expresso, $9 none the less,when for example coffee is free.  took time to voice all these complaints to Brendan the duty manager and of course, there wasn't a single response or acknowledgement by email, any small gift in the room, and no communication to any of the issues have been addressed or resolved. In fact following morning once again I found myself arguing with the waiter overcharging for expresso.  Quite frankly, it's not a bad hotel overall but considering Marriott has the audacity to call it the luxury collection, completely fulfills my expectations of Marriott. I stayed at the Hyatt centric fisherman's wharf last time I was here for less money in the room service including Bell service and say request for the complete opposite in a positive way.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Room was spacious enough and had neat architecture elements, but that's where the good parts end.

First, in the bathroom, one of the plastic cups was used - out of the plastic bag, WET, and put on top of the other cup as if it was new. Also, draft from the windows, and in SF, that's cold. Sink, if you turn on the water and aren't careful, you'll have Niagra fall like pressures come rushing out and get everything wet, and to make matters worse, the drain was pretty severely clogged - and the lever to control the drainage - completely broken.

Second, the doors and walls are SO thin, starting at 6AM, I could hear every person walking by, talking, etc.

Finally, when I checked in, was given a choice amongst 250 points, free internet, and something else. I chose free internet, and was told to just sign up for any of the options I get presented on the browser. Well, to my surprise, I looked at my eFolio in the morning, and I got charged...called the front desk, no pickup. Had to go downstairs and take care of it there.

For a "luxury" hotel, this really missed the mark.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I still love the feeling I get when I walk into the lobby here. The old world charm is great. Of course the jewel is the Garden Court where people have been enjoying afternoon tea for years. I've never had the tea but still enjoy just hanging out there and taking in the scene. The rooms vary widely and I've always been treated nicely as a Platinum. Service aims to please. Could use a facelift but still works as is.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//GmapID></record>

Beautiful hotel with staff that was 99% amazing at their jobs. A few staffing glitches that could be easily fixed. The biggest turnoff was going down to the G&C Lounge/restaurant to be seated for breakfast on Sunday at 10:30AM and told it was "CLOSED" in a not so nice manner.< /review>

A very good hotel in very convenient location. It is just beside the metro station. But you may find difficulty to find this place as there is no big signage. I liked the lobby of this hotel. The glass art is fantastic.< /Review>

<Review>The hotel itself, is a beautiful building.

We arrived during the strike. I received no warning from the hotel. I did receive an email about a week earlier from the AASLD, the conference I travelled to attend. I received a “special rate” of 339/night for a single king room through the conference. Because of the late notice, and the fact that I received this discounted rate through the conference website, I chose not to cancel and book at another hotel.

We arrived to no valet/bell service, and had to walk through a cloud of weed/hot garbage smell and screams to get to the reception counter.

Upon check-in, were informed that there would be no room service for the duration of our stay. We were “upgraded” to another room on the other side of the hotel which would be “quieter.” I admit we could not hear the strike from this room. The window looked out across the courtyard to a brick wall.

I have stayed in cleaner rooms at two star hotels. There were dirty rings from glasses and greasy fingerprints on the table.  We did not have toiletries re-stocked and our trash was not emptied daily.

The room was pretty, with high ceilings and a comfortable king bed. No coffee/tea or minibar was available in the room. We did have some complementary bottled water on arrival, which was not restocked.

During my stay I used the side entrance to Jessie street as it is closest to the conference center. On my way to the conference I was harassed and shamed by some union representative for not changing my reservation.

On the morning of check out we had planned to have breakfast in the atrium. We sat ourselves and were ignored for a full 25 minutes. We were not even offered water. At that point we decided to get breakfast around the corner at the Grove. I got eggs florentine and a latte for 15 dollars which is what the hotel cafe charges for a plain yogurt.

When we returned to the hotel, we asked to have our vehicle brought around to the side entrance so we wouldn’t have to wait in the noise/smell associated with the picket line. We were informed they would “have to get a manager” to approve that. We took our own luggage across the street and located our vehicle in the parking garage.

I just received a receipt for my stay. I was charged 84 dollars per day for an “oversized vehicle” which they define as >9 feet tall. I will be contesting this charge.

Very disappointing stay. I paid 1500 dollars for a three night “luxury” experience when no luxury services were available.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< gmap_id>

Everything was great. Dad is a member spending many points here... was really disturbed when he awoke at 6am to a dog barking nonstop next door. Must have been left in the room alone and was nuts. My dad went downstairs to inquire and complain at the front desk. Was told dogs were aloud in the hotel but when my dad didn't leave and gave his room number, the man at the front desk said dogs actually weren't aloud on the floor we were on. Furious, my dad explained how he and my mom enjoyed drinks at the bar late and were really looking forward to enjoying a lazy morning. This experience ruined their plans and stay. The man at the front desk simply apologized, refused to do anything and sent my dad on his way. He is still upset and brought it up infront of family two days ago. Staying at the W tonight instead!!!</Review>

We have stayed in 50 starwood hotels over the past 6 years, including several luxury collection hotels. This hotel has been the least satisfactory of any stay. The room is quite basic, which is acceptable, but the bathroom is below typical starwood level and even included some mold. The walls are paper thin, in which we were kept up at night by our neighbors basic conversation, prompting a need to call the front desk. The desk was responsive and did respond however.
Overall, the hotel was poor enough we considered forgoing our starpoints an moving to another hotel in the area. It is unlikely we would return, and that is something we have never said about a starwood property</text>

Great hotel from appearance to comfort to location. Really was enjoyable.

I was disappointed to hear that the hotel does not have a Club Lounge. As an SPG member, and when extended to me, the Lounge is a great last minute and quick solution. The front desk staff member did provide free wifi which we made use of but that has become more standard than not these days......especially in SF!! I subsequently learned that some SPG members were provided breakfast vouchers....should have asked I guess!</Text>

<Rate>None< /Rate><Text>I checked in to the Palace Hotel with great expectations given it is part of The Luxury Collection. That went out the window at check-in. I am a platinum member and the check-in agent gave me a terrible room, on the lowest floor and as far away from the elevator as possible (and in that hotel, that is saying something). My room was terrible. Small, needs updating. No robes. Lights were unplugged. Very loud from the Market street side. Overall, much worse than any of the other starwood properties in San Francisco.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

when we were unexpectedly bumped off a flight and had to overnight in SFO we decided to try the Palace as it was always a dream for us to stay there. we went to the Pied Piper for a few drinks to depressurize and when Joel made us our first round, we knew we were staying a while.... from the atmosphere to the quality to the superlative treatment we received from Joel, we just about decided to cancel work the next day and stay another night... he got our preferences figured out and just made it easy to be there,, thank you Joel. Thank you Palace Hotel! we will return as soon as possible.... Bruce & Lori</review>

My wife and I found the Palace to have old world charm and elegance of the bygone era. From the sumptious entrance, to the stained glass dome where you can enjoy the Sunday Jazz brunch feast, to the excllent service and friendly staff. We have travelled all over the globe and this is a true gem and in our neighbourhood - can't wait to return again!<//Review>

<Review>THis ia a beautiful hotel but I have some unmet expectations. First, I had to return to the front day daily becaucse my key would not work. Although the front-desk said it may be a lock problem and would send someone up to check they never did. Next, the carpet in my room wa dirty and the maid service never in my 6 day stay replenished the soaps. I guess they saw that there was still the oroinal bars that Iwas using and decided not to bring more. That was unacceptale becuse I doate unused bars to charity. For the pluses, the hotel is beautiful and has doorman service and the fresh flowers. I had breakfast at the hotel dining room and was surprised that everything was on the steam table; there were no omellets to order and no seafood or non-pork meats or bagels. My last remark is the the cocierge recommended 2 Thai restaurants on 2nd street which was having a street festival and I couldn't get to. Both restaurants were a few blocks from the hotel and I thought they shuld have known what was going on in the neighborhood before sending a single woman into a mob scene. WHen I brought it to their attention the person was very nonchalant about my experience. I have never had a concierge not know this kind of infomation. THe Palace does not live up to it's luxury distinction.< /Review>< pictures>

Hotel was Grand Looking. Bed was very comfortable and shower was great. I realize this is an old hotel but up keep not up to par with other 4 or 5 star hotels. Paint chipping on walls and doors cracking or splitting. Many carpet stains in room. I would suggest putting coffee in each room for your guest. A small two pot serving. I would like to have sleep in longer but had to leave room to get coffee. Yes I could have had room service, but if I was going to go to the Lobby I might as well hop over to StarBucks which I did. Other than that Brunch was awesome and staff was great.< /review>

<Review>First, I am a foreigner, I admit my English is not quite well, but I could understand English.

So this morning at 10:00 we went to the right coner of the front desk to check out. I asked some questions about billing, when asked him a SECOND question to make sure, he was very impatient and spoke so fast to a foreigner. And started with” I already said that blablabla...”and using an official language with many professional words to answer a foreigner, but actually he could totally answer in yes or no. But he didn’t. After answering the billing questions, he just stared at us literally without saying “you are all set or have a nice day to imply the process is done or we can leave”, just stared at us, it just so embarrassing and making people uncomfortable, and his attitude is more like a US custom staff, plus, no smile at all. The checking out time just makes the whole living experience to a negative impression.</Review>< Pictures>

My girlfriend and I stayed at the Palace for a weekend stay-cation earlier this month. The hotel is beautiful and the accommodations were fair.

I reserved the room with my credit card and my girlfriend put her credit card down for incidentals upon checkin. After our stay, my girlfriend noticed two large charges on her card from the Palace. I called to ask what they were for and it turns out the hotel charged both her and my card for the full amount of our stay.This was shocking, but the Palace acknowledged the mistake, apologized, and promised to give my girlfriend the money back. However, it's been three weeks since reporting this to the Palace and they still haven't given the money back. I have called repeatedly, and each time they tell me they will look into it and call me back. They never called back and I had to go to the hotel three times to talk to them. The money still hasn't been returned and I am disappointed with the staff has handled this entire ordeal.

I urge those staying in the Palace to review their bank statements with care in the event this happens to you, too.</Text>

<text>We stay at the Palace for 1-2 nights at a time, generally 1-2 times per year for pleasure. We like the hotel. On this trip, the AC made a fairly loud clunk each time it turned on/off which was a problem because we had it on throughout the night due to unseasonably warm temperatures over the 2013 holidays. The pillows were too large to be useful, and next time we'll remember to ask for reasonable pillows @ the front desk. We left a note about the AC.

On the plus side, this is a classic historic hotel with great rooms and ambiance. It has very comfortable beds, the best showers and soap!

I am a Platinum member and stayed at the hotel on October 19th. I have two complaints.
First- When I ldeparted I left my Beats headset on the nightstand next to the bed in room 612.
While at the airport in SFO I called and spoke to Security/Lost&Found's contact Michael. He promised to immediately check the room and then call me back. 
No Call Back.
I called on October 25th and left a message for Michael. 
No Call back. 
On October 27th I called and asked to speak to a manager in the same department. I was switched to Jphn's voicemail and left a message. 
No Call Back....
On October 30th I called and asked to speak to a Manager in any department and was switched to Sarah. She finally solved the situation and of course my headset was never recovered. 
After taking 10 days I had very little hope that they would have been found. 
Seocnd- they dining arrangements at the hotel are very poor considering the quality of the asset. I attempted to have a business dinner and make a reservation for dinner. They don't take reservations. Then you have to walk through the bar and into a very Spartan room to be seated for dinner. The food was good but the ambience was not.<//review>

Top notch luxury hotel. Facilities are superb and staff friendly and helpful.

One thing, though: in our room, the telephone extension had no dial tone and the main line always showed a flashing message light. When notifying the desk,nobody seemed to know how to fix it and always referenced “the engineer” who never answered his extension and never showed up. Ditto for the audio system. It was inoperative upon taking the room. Finally, after the mysterious engineer could not be reached, a kind bellman replaced the unit but was unable to explain how to operate it.<//Text>

This hotel has flair and history combined with a great location. The feeling of the grand days of SFO in a tastefully modernised building. Only the flaky, costly internet reception and the somewhat poky, antiquated bathrooms in the smaller rooms stops it from getting 5 stars. I have stayed here a few times and this time had a suite which was incredible. It is a great venue to run a conference for approx 1000 people with everything very accessible and plenty of room to spread out.<//Text>

<text>This century old nine story hotel stands immediately adjacent to both the BART Montgomery Street Station and the Monadnock Building, and across Market Street from Lotta's Fountain. Elegant and luxurious since 1909 it has remained an important San Francisco landmark as well as host to many of the city's great events. The "Garden Court" is beautiful and inviting. Staff is amiable and rooms are comfortable.<//text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We came to the Bay Area two weeks ago to get married in Muir Woods. Even though the ceremony was in Marin and weekend activities were all in Napa and Half Moon Bay, we chose to splurge and spend all four nights at the beautiful Palace hotel in San Francisco, excited about the old world elegance, grandeur, and world-class service. It was out of our way, but we didn't care. I indicated when I made the reservation two months prior that it was our wedding, and even took the time to e-mail the hotel GM prior to our arrival (he never responded). Upon arrival, we were told that there were no upgrades available. I found this odd seeing as I had informed them 2 months ago that it was a once-in-a-lifetime occasion, and had also taken the time to e-mail the GM directly. I figured no worries, they probably had plenty of full-rate customers paying for those rooms. We took the room we were given and were surprised to see a beautiful bouquet of flowers waiting for us. I was heartened and touched at what I thought was a lovely consolation gesture for not being able to upgrade us. I was mistaken - it was a lovely gesture from personal friends of ours, not the hotel.

Our room on the 8th floor was elegantly decorated (old-world, but not outdated) and clean. The view was nothing to talk about - looking directly into the windows of adjacent office buildings. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the pillows fluffy almost to the point of discomfort. There was no coffee maker in the room, but happily the fridge was one of those that actually had tons of empty space for guests' items, not just minibar stock. The coffee at the in-house Ghirardelli cafe was to die for anyway. Water pressure in the shower was fantastic. I agree with the other reviewer that noted the lack of available electrical outlets in the room. Also, as another reviewer stated, the walls are VERY thin. I was able to hear the telephone conversation of the guest in the next room quite clearly, as well as numerous guests in the hallways at 2am. As there seem to be a lot of families staying there, the pool at 9pm on a Friday looked like a kids' water park in the summertime. The hot tub was filled with teenagers. We promptly walked right back out and the spa attendant gave us a sympathetic look and said, We open in the morning at 5am! :) All staff we encountered were polite, but not particularly gracious.

Hotel location was fantastic, we were able to walk to the mall, the Embarcadero, etc. Cabs were plentiful and easy to hail.

I must say that every step of our journey from our home state of FL, people went out of their way to acknowledge our occasion and make it special for us (complimentary champagne on the flight, complimentary champagne at dinner, personalized menus, an upgraded rental car, etc - all without us asking). However, not once did the Palace acknowledge our occasion or do anything to make it special for us. I guess I had wrongly assumed that it was things like this where hotels such as the Palace shine - where they separate themselves from their more standard competitors. We were looking for it to be a special stay at an old-world-elegance hotel. Instead It was a very ordinary stay at old-world-elegance hotel. In fact, by the time Sunday morning had rolled around, we decided not to give the Palace Hotel any more of our money and cancelled the Garden Court brunch reservation for four.

I'm giving an overall rating of Average because it was exactly that. There was NOTHING special about this stay at this hotel, and I'm quite disappointed in having personally reached out to the general manager and then receiving not even so much as an acknowledge or reply. For the amount of money that we spent to stay here, we quite frankly expected more.</Review>

I tend to stay at this hotel more often than the other SPG properties in SF. However, they also seem to have the most variety of room types ranging from TINY to luxurious. With SPG status I have no problems booking here when the hotel is not sold out because I can usually get moved from the smallest room to something a little more comfortable. However, if you get stuck with a traditional room you may not enjoy your experience too much just because of the size of the room. The hotel amenities are some of the best and you definitely feel that you are staying in a more upscale hotel compared to the other SPG properties in town – thicker towels, luxurious robes, the staff are genuinely more friendly. Since I stay at this hotel often I generally receive a note from the manager as a welcome. It’s never expected but it tells me that they acknowledge that I spend time at their property and it makes me smile.< /review>

Came and stayed here at the end of May of 2013 and checked out after one evening because we couldn't use the bathroom... They had just did something with the plumbing which caused black water to spew out of the faucet and shower. The guest relations manager was very kind and made it right, and urged us to "give them another chance if we are ever back in town."
So, I'm back... And there was no note made under my name or account about the incident. I am a platinum SPG member and, didn't even get put into a better room. On top of that, the lady checking me in told me that there wasn't anyone who has the role of/similar to "guest relations manager" at this hotel -which is hogwash... Anyway, I came back here because I really wanted to give them a second chance (the lady who helped us last time was very sincere and kind). However, I'm very disappointed that I came back here... This was not what I was expecting.<//review>

<review>Beautiful and historic hotel in a great location downtown. Despite being an older hotel, the rooms appear to have been renovated recently and are in very good condition. My SPG Platinum status was noted and I was upgraded to a spacious suite with a separate living area. Would definitely recommend this hotel, especially to those who appreciate historic properties.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The upgraded room was small, and had no drawers for clothes and the bathroom had virtually no counter space, or hanging places for towels etc. It certainly didn't live up to a luxury hotel. Meals at lunch for the convention was cold and not tasty. If my meeting wasn't held here, I wouldn't be at this hotel. Unreasonable fee of over $70 to park a car.<//review>

It was a real treat staying at the Palace. From the greetings I received at checkin from Taka to my checkout four days later, I was made to feel welcome. Service was attentive. The hotel itself is a great treasure. Only complaint was I thought the continental breakfast could have used a bit of pizzazz.<//Review>

This hotel is pretty much in the center of everything that we wanted to do, walking distance from the piers, Union Square, many great restaurants and bakeries (if you want to go out for breakfast). Wonderful staff, too. The beds are very comfortable, and we were glad for the hot tub most days after spending the day out touring!<//text>

Pool and fitness center is a great attraction downtown San Fransisco and this hotel excels in this domain. Pool is indoors but has a glass dome exposed to the sky that makes it very attractive in the winter. Unfortunately here no gowns or slippers in the room for the pool which can be a long trip. Looking at people barefoot in the elevators with their wet swimming outfits was not so good.<//review>

However, there were some things that made me wonder. For example, they had no one time/ throwaway slippers in the room. Only bathrobes. We had to call the concierge to get them and waited a good 15 min just to be able to go to the pool. Noone there except us had slippers there either so I assume they simply don't provide them. Kind of weird for a hotel this class to not providd basic amenities any truck stop hotel chain has.
Also, internet costs $15 per day. You may use internet in the lobby for 1 hour every day with 1 device per room. For SPG members internet is free but only if they were members before checking in and if they booked through the hotel website. That's ridiculous to charge for something any starbucks gives out for free. I really don't get it why luxury chains do that. Just mark up your nightly prices by $15 if you need the money that desperately. 
In summary, definitely one of the more comfortable places to stay in SF, staff was friendly but hotel policies and management should seriously reconsider some of their practices.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

This is a hotel with a very good location, an excellent downstairs level, and pretty good rooms. This might have been a luxury hotel at some point and maybe select suites still are, but the rooms are nothing very special anymore. Impeccably clean, comfortable, but a bit dated and very small with many having dreary interior views. I would stay at a more modern hotel with newer rooms and amenities and just have breakfast here.<//review>

<Review>I have an office in San Francisco and over the last 15 years, I have stayed in a lot of hotels in the City. I have spent more and I have spent less, but I stay at The Palace every chance I get. The hotel couldn’t be more convenient, the entry to the hotel is beautiful, the Garden Court is exquisite, the fitness center is well equipped, but the reason I stay at the hotel is the staff. I have stayed in boutique hotels in the City that when my room key didn’t work the front desk clerk didn’t remember checking me in, a total of an elapsed 5 minutes. That just doesn’t happen at The Palace; the front desk staff, to the person, is attentive and extremely helpful, the concierge can improve any trip, the fitness center attendant is one of the most pleasant people I have ever met, and the bell staff handles large groups capably and remains cordial in the process. I know some people think some of the rooms are small, but my experience is the rooms are typical to large, particularly, for a downtown hotel. We’ll be in San Francisco twice this summer for vacation; I could stay any place I want; I’ll be at The Palace.<//Review></record>

Good hotel in a historic building right off market Street. Good location although is a little dead on weekends. Nice breakfast spread including hot and cold options served in an amazing atrium. Rooms are modern, comfortable and quiet. Many lights make up for rooms that are on the interior lightwell. Those rooms are really quiet but less light. Good fitness center and lap pool, which is cool and nice for doing laps. Hottub was under repair during my visit. Overall comfortable, quiet hotel with good amenities in business district of San Francisco.< /Text>

<review>We booked a beautiful room but we're not able to stay due to my 6 month old getting sick. When we asked for a refund the hotel would not accommodate. $300 a night and there is a no refund policy, absolutely ridiculous. My oldest daughter really wanted to stay here, even cried when we couldn't stay because it was the nicest hotel we had ever booked and it was for her birthday. We tried even rescheduling for a different weekend but still no accommodations were made. Really very saddened and frustrated with the whole experience. We can't afford to throw money away like this so we will not be staying here in the future. ☹️<//review><resp>None</resp><rate>1</rate>< username>

This hotel describes itself as a luxury hotel, but I was offered three rooms that lacked anything close to luxury. The carpets were dirty. The lamps had a green residue on them. The artwork was uninspiring. The bathroom ceiling had rust stains over a ceiling panel. The sitting chair had stains on them. I arrived early and was told I would receive a call when my room was ready. I am still waiting on that call. The best thing was the concierge; she was extremely helpful and pleasant.</Text>

Combine noisy location, with paper thin walls between rooms, and a faulty fire alarm system prompting evacuation at 1:15 am, and you have the Palace Hotel. As you won't be able to sleep, you might want to use internet, which is ridiculously expensive. if you manage to doze off, the fire alarm will certainly wake you again bright and early, then repetitive announcements rubbing in the fact that the fire alarm is false and you don't need to evacuate will keep you up until you stagger out into Market Street for the relative piece and quiet of morning rush hour. The hotel staff is really good at apologizing, suggesting serious amount of practice, further suggesting that I am not the only person unhappy with this establishment.

If you still decide to stay here, you should hope that the construction across the street has been completed, or at least they talked to the worker who thought it to be a good idea to throw metal drawers and other garbage out of a third floor window into a metal container on the street for half an hour at 11:30 pm.</review>

We always stay here when we can, and this Christmas the rate was affordable and I even upgraded to a suite. Everything was wonderful except the soundproofing in the guest room 494, and the plumbing noise was huge. Concierges were extremely helpful, spoke French, printed boarding passes, made dinner reservations, etc. Great hotel!<//text>

Lovely stay except it was too cold. Conference and meeting rooms far too cold for comfort. All women were complaining... it's OK for me as they tend to wear jackets and t-shirts under their shirts. But for women who feel the cold much more and don't wear as much, it's not good. There is no need to blow cold air at us. Fed this back last year, but still the same. Spoilt it for me.</Text>< rate>

Great service. Beautiful lobby, garden court, pool and bar. Expensive but you get what you pay for. Very posh and historic. The rooms are very clean. The elevators are quick and you don't wait long for one. Easy access to the Ferry Building and Union Square. The only thing is since it is on the edge of the financial district there is quite a bit of traffic and very hard to move around in a car. Walk don't drive. And if you are driving head west not east. Also as this is San Francisco the homeless population is large. They don't bug you but they are a constant reminder of the issues that this city has with drugs and homelessness.</Text>

<text>I love the Palace Hotel and plan to return. The location is great. The rooms are comfortable and lovely. The pool and spa facilities are very nice...especially the pool. My only complaint about my recent trip is that at 2am when i found my room was located next to a loud snorer and called the front desk to request some ear plugs, it took an hour and 15 minutes and three people to get earplugs to me. It seemed like a lot of time to wait.
I will return but this experience was a bummer.< /text>< rating>

<review>Regarding location, the streets and area around the Hotel were always very busy with traffic and people. Within a 1-block radius there were many homeless people hanging around, and people were loitering around the Hotel side entrances. Regarding the room, there was something wrong with my bathroom window, and cold air rushed in all the time. The bathroom blinds wouldn't operate and/or close completely. Regarding service, I couldn't get an ice bucket plastic liner although I went down to the bell desk and phoned twice. I asked the concierge some questions about tours of the city, and he acted politely to my face, but when I turned my back and was leaving, he made some denigrating comment about me to another staff member there. Regarding costs, meals were about $20.00+, with a 20% surcharge and a $2.00 delivery fee, so it was easy to jack up a bill quickly. I paid about $400 a night, and was not allowed to change to a cheaper room after my arrival. I was told by a staff member that my rate was very reasonable, meaning the sky's the limit for rates at this Hotel. The Hotel charged $15 per night extra for Internet.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>It is always so nice when you go back to a hotel and get recognized for having been there before. It is also so nice when, even if you are not an elite member of their hotel group, they give you a room that does not look out onto a brick wall when there are plenty of rooms available. I even called down to the front desk to ask if I could switch rooms and I was switched to the central reservation line. Nice...
In the room - nice amenities; comfortable; clean. No hotel binder explaining the services, etc of the hotel and I had to call several places around the hotel (bell desk, front desk, concierge) to find out some pretty basic information.
Don't think I'll stay here again - especially when there are so many great hotels within a 3 or 4 block radius.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Rating>None< /Rating><text>This was the worst hotel in my life!  The only good was a comfortable bed. But, I could not even enjoy my sleep because the noise right outside my window (room 504) was a continual nuisance from 5am to 11pm. The ear plugs that the front desk provided did not work even with a pillow over my head. My 4 hour jet lag (from Brazil) and precious 24 hrs  complicated my stay even further. Further, I didn’t have anyone service during my stay (it was a dirty mess). I scheduled a business meeting in the restaurant but had to leave because the street noise was too loud and the fact that you were not serving ANY food (at all)!  After my full day of meetings (with jet lag), I tried to order a meal, but you didn’t have any room service, so I had to go to the street late at night to find something safe and quick. 

For all my troubles, I was given “a $150 credit for food” [which was later applied to my stay.  Effectively a 15% discount].  Honestly, this was an insult!  I feel like I should have been paid for my miserable experience. I will never go back to this hotel, nor any related hotel. I will also make sure all my global network of friends hear this story.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>Went there for drinks, had a great experience and the atmosphere was great. Then I left my credit card there, and when I came back an hour later I ended up spending a full hour being bussed from 1 person "who could help me" to the next. Terrible coordination and service, particularly by the concierge . So it's a beautiful great place to visit, just so long as nothing goes wrong.<//review><time>1455524818362<//time>< resp>

<review>Our 3rd stay within the last 10 days. Inconsistent servicing of our room. We had no turndown service (only had it once over the 7 nights we stayed at the hotel). The beds are uncomfortable. The bathroom toilet had no lid so flushing sent germs everywhere. The a/c in the room did not work and the windows don't open so the room was hot all evening. We were disappointed.<//review>< Date>

As a top tier Starwood member and a lifetime platinum, I stay in many Starwood hotels. I consider the Palace to be one of the finest U.S. hotels in the Starwood collection. The level of service is outstanding, easily comparable to some of the finest Europesn hotels that I have stayed in. Ruben at the front desk is very personable and informative. The Palace is always my first choice when visiting San Francisco.<//Review>

Great location for exploring San Francisco, Bart Station right at the doorsteps, close to Union Square and a short walk to Ferry Building. Room was ok, older, carpet worn. High ceiling made the room feel bigger which was nice. Big hotel, did not really receive any personal service, no bellhop opening the doors, no warm welcome at the front desk so it's hard to classify this as a luxury hotel for me.<//Text>

<text>Paid for an upgraded "Cityscape View" room, booked and paid ahead to ensure I would have a nice room for my wife to enjoy.  Upon arrival we get a view of a brick wall, and offered points but not my money back for the difference between what I paid for and what I received.  Way to treat a Platinum Preferred member.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmapID></record>

This gorgeous historic hotel is full of surprises. Who would have thought it had room for a beautiful lap pool, whirlpool and sauna? We didn't and this hotel is the first I ever stayed at, which did not include an information booklet in the room. At checkout we were told, this could have been found on the television. That morning I tried to access my invoice, which was not delivered in paper, on the television, but I could not get the Menu button to activate.</Review>

This hotel is in a geat location and is really nice. My only critique would be the bedding. The bed had a down duvet instead of a blanket and sheet. While this seems like a luxary at first, I find it to be a negative. The bed didn't have a top sheet or a blanket. This means that the only choice is duvet or nothing. Its too hot for use year round, resulting in needing to boost the AC unit. (wasted energy). I was still hot, meaning that I and every other guest, was sweating on the duvet. Im pretty sure they are NOT cleaned inbetween guests. ICK. Now that I think of it- this would explain why the room has a slightly unclean smell even after the maid had been there. Advice- replace the Duvet with a cotton (washable) blanket.<//review>

We came to SF to celebrate our 41st wedding anniversary from the moment we pulled up in front of the palace staff was very helpful. Everyone was so friendly and efficient..from the doorman to the housekeeper. check in desk was so helpful. thank you (Ruben) Shorty after we arrived in out room champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were delivered. We also had connecting rooms so that we could visit with our Aunt and Uncle. We loved our room, especially the king size bed. It was the most comfortable bed we've slept in at a hotel. would highly recommend the palace to all our family and friends and our 41st anniversary will be remembered by us for years to come. The palace staff made it memorable. Thank you!<//Text>

<text>Our stay was excellent from the moment we checked in to check out. There were three of us and we reserved one superior suite.
I have to say the Couchbed didn't have a good mattress so the first night sleep wasn't so great but after complaining they changed it to an extra bed which was as good as the Kingsize one.
The breakfast area is really beautiful and the breakfast is good as well, just the 7$ extra charge for platinum guests for the Palace breakfast is a little bit unnecessary regarding the general hotel price.
In room dining was excellent.
Parking is the most expensive I have seen in SF with 72$ but behind the hotel is another garage for just 35$ per night.
In the end its really worth the price and one of the best hotels in SF to stay in.</text>< user_name>

Palace Hotel was a luxurious experience, though certain details can be improved. Parts of the hotel furniture/walls looked tired and housekeeping wasn't thorough in tidying the room. You get most of what you pay for though with the easy access to everything, and overall it was a pleasant stay. The swimming pool looks really nice but the changing room is a bit old and small.<//text>

Fantastic hotel in the Financial District. Lobby is posh and elegant and so are the rooms. Love the gym and the indoor pool as well as the lady attendant. She is such a darling. Excellent service from the front desk to the housekeeping. There is free coffee in the lobby and you can ask to have a coffee maker brought up to your room. The only thing I disliked about my stay is the WIFI. How can it not be free? This is supposed to be a business hotel.<//Text>

<text>The Palace is a luxurious hotel with lots of old charm to the architecture. Overall, the housekeepers were very thorough and the staff in general was very friendly and accommodating.

Part of the problem with such a high class place is that you expect everything to be perfect. A couple of times I called the front desk and the phone just rang and rang. One time, the front desk did answer, but put me on hold and never got back. The Concierge though was very responsive and friendly. While we received a Deluxe Grand Room, there wasn't efficient use of the space, specifically there were only two upright chairs to sit, not lounge in. In a room on the third floor, during the night and early morning we can hear the buses and trolleys on the street. The windows are not very well insulated, showing the age of the building. And for a place in San Francisco, there's no soy milk available with the free coffee in the morning, even when you ask.< /text>< Response>

Checked in around noon and didn't get my room until 9 pm.  There was a major strike at the hotel with incredibly loud, disgruntled, and angry workers marching out front and the sides of the hotel from 6:30 am to 10:30 pm each day.  Was offered 500 points, but this doesn't seem a reasonable accommodation for the trouble.< /text>

<review>I love the look of this old hotel. It has all the style you would expect of this era's elegance. The bed was comfortable and nice. The only thing is that there was a formal party there that night so noise from the hallway with returning party goers was pretty loud. I would recommend staying here (but would suggest the hotel invest in heavier doors).</review><rating>None<//rating>< date>

It's a gorgeous hotel. I walk by it everyday and decided to stop inside and check if out. Can't wait to stay in a room there soon!</review>

<Rating>None<//Rating><review>Outstanding location. Very easy to get from San Francisco airport. Bart stop is literally just outside the side door on Market. Hotel is gorgeous and very comfortable and clean, well maintained. Nice furniture in the room. Easy to operate climate control. Staff is very helpful. A pleasure to stay there. Nearby dining opportunities are excellent. This may be same at all the other nice hotels, but there is no in-room coffee maker. Room service and hotel dining expensive. No complementary or inexpensive breakfast. In room refrigerator not very deep. Even though housed in a cabinet, refrigerator was a little loud. Television picture had delays, not sure if it was the TV, the reception or the TV station. Could also hear a little bit from other room(s), but not too bad. Overall noise level was OK, could be much worse. Toiletries provided are excellent quality, plenty of towels provided. Housekeeping did an excellent job. There was an envelope with someone else's name on it on the desk so was a little nervous they double booked the room or something, but apparently not. Not sure if I was supposed to get an envelope - I did not open it, probably should have asked about it. Didn't get a chance to use the pool or fitness area or even go look at so can't rate that.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</GmapID></record>

Beautiful hotel with exquisite finishes. The rooms are nice but less impressive than the public spaces. Only critique is that room was not cleaned until almost 5:00 pm.< /Text>

Enjoyed the history and the ambiance of the hotel. Food was hard to get, long lines for breakfast, and the buffet very mediocre. Check-in smooth. The room very basic. The walls were rather thin and the hallway noise loud. Only one bathrobe, had to ask to get the second one, was delivered promptly. Very expensive for what it was.< /Review>

Beautifully remodeled rooms and historic elegance throughout the hotel make your stay feel extra special. Disappointed by the service- we were told that check-in was at 2, but when we arrived at 4pm we were informed that the suite we booked was unavailable and wasn't going to be ready until a few more hours... They suggested we take a smaller room and did not offer any compensation until asked. All that was offered was a $20 food voucher... (much less than the price difference between rooms...)< /text>

This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. Walking distance to many area attractions and shopping. We stayed with our young son for two days prior to moving on to Napa. Upon check in Gold SPG status was acknowledged and late check out was offered. Had some issues with the HVAC that were addressed immediately. Heated toilet seat was awesome! Loved the complimentary coffee and tea in the morning. Such a nice feature. Lobby was beautiful. Was able to have a glass of wine down there. 

The one negative was the pool. It was freezing. One of the reasons we chose this particular hotel was because we wanted our son to be able to enjoy the pool. Sight seeing with your parents can get old, so the pool was the one specific thing we had for him to enjoy. It was so cold, everyone in the pool area was crowded into the hot tub. It was ridiculous and made the experience very unpleasant. Please heat the pool. It's so nice, but not enjoyable when it's ice cold.<//review>

Once again The Palace made our trip to San Francisco a memeorable one. Our Daughter has been going to Academy of Art for 4 years now and we have tried other Hotels. None have the Sauna, Spa, Pool, Helpful Staff, ( I am especially pointing out Scott at Reception,Lydia in the Spa, and the Pied Piper Bar) or overall feeling a being in a Luxury Hotel. We have 2 more visits in May for Graduation and would think of staying nowhere else. Kudos once again...<//review>

<text>Absolutely amazing venue to stay in as well as reasonably priced for the location, the room itself was amazing and we were in the lower priced room. The staff are pleasant and actually willing to help you if you ever need to ask for anything. I loved the stairway that leads to every level, gives it an amazing early 1900s feel.<//text>< Pictures>

The room is excellent, neat, clean, minimalist yet classy. Love the wall paint crisp and the moldings on point. I specifically noticed your shower room in your pool area, neat, clean and again minimalist yet classy, as if we were in European hotel, this is our second time in Palace and will definitely not the last...<//review>

< Review>
This hotel is lovely - old, historic, grand. But it is IS old. That means one has to keep in mind a couple of things:
1. If you want new, simple, elegant design, this is not the hotel for you.
2. If you want big, luxurious bathrooms, not the hotel for you.
3. If you want privacy or any sense of sound-proofing in your room, this is not the hotel for you.
BUT:
1. If you want to proximate to all that San Francisco has to offer, you can't beat the location.
2. If you want to experience grand service and surroundings, the Pied Piper and the Garden Court are unmatched.
3. If you want a room that resembles nothing so much as a lovely little ring box, you should definitely give it a try.
A couple of items to note:
1. This hotel gets crowded. It's large; check-in times can be very crowded in the small-ish area used for those purposes. There are also many public tours that meet in the foyer, and many private events that happen in the grand spaces - so don't expect to enjoy peaceful tranquility in the public spaces of this hotel.
2. The team working the cab stand, valet, New Montgomery Street entrance are INSANELY GOOD. Props to them!
3. The Concierge team is great, although they can be overwhelmed at certain times of the day.
4. The beds and linens are lovely - very comfortable and well-maintained.
5. The TV remotes are too complicated for easy use; and a channel guide would be helpful.<//Review>

I spent 25 minutes when booking our reservation with a Starwood representative to get the rooms that we needed for our brief stay to be placed on the same floor....one with a king/queen the other needed two doubles. In order to achieve this I was told by a Starwood representative that my husband and I needed to book 2 grand deluxe rooms which was the only way that we could insure getting the rooms near each other on the same floor. It was important to us that are two rooms were on the same floor as we were traveling with our children. In fact my husband and I chose a smaller room then we initially desired for ourselves in order to accommodate the availability of what was on hand. When hanging up with Starwood I was insured by our representative,who had coordinated directly with the hotel reservations staff, that we would have two grand deluxe rooms with the appropriate bed requirements on the top floor of the hotel that were near each other. That was our expectation when we checked in. Simple enough.

We checked into the hotel around 6:30 at night only to find that nothing about the reservation was as I had booked. Once placed in our rooms(Which were on an entirely different floors , each with king beds), we had to move within moments due to the screaming children that were dismantling the room next to us. The hallway leading to the end of the Corredor in which our room was located was littered with cribs, dirty reminants from room service carts and sounded and looked more like a Chucky cheese than it did a luxury hotel. Our second room which was also book-ended by extremely loud people did not have the two double beds that we booked. Both of our rooms were entirely unacceptable and would have made it impossible to have a second's peace for the 30 hours we were to be in San Francisco. The moment when we alerted the front desk of the conditions of the rooms and the error of the booking I was told that my reservations were merely "requests" and that the hotel could only do their best to accommodate those "requests" not guarantee them. From the time we checked in we then waited approximately two hours to be put into two new rooms that were in fact on the same floor though one was a standard room and quite a bit smaller than the room that we booked only to be told that it was a "grand deluxe" room "class". Being beyond reason at this point I found myself arguing the lack of space, additional windows and bathroom size, to prove my point. The other room was a handicap room with a bench in the shower, etc....needless to say, these were not the rooms we booked nor the conditions we expected from a luxury hotel. I was a little more than peeved at the runaround and lack of continuity in the hotel staff's addressing of this issue. At no point in time did a manager apologize for the inconvenience and tell us to go sit in the bar, have a drink on them while they sorted out the rooms and had our bags delivered to the new accommodations . At no point in time was there a note apologizing for leaving us walking about the hotel for two hours at 7 o'clock at night. After an 8 hour drive through a rainstorm from LosAngeles Unfortunately we missed our dinner reservation in San Francisco for one of our nights there and needed to go down to the restaurant at the hotel where we dropped $300 on the dinner bill just to grab a bite while we waited to land somewhere in the hotel.. Some of the front desk people dealing with the reservations were kind others were snooty(only one in particular). I have never seen a hotel that is part of the luxury hotel brand have such an inconsistent staff. At no point in time did the manager intervene. The hotel botched our stay and we felt as though we were the complaining high-need patrons. Never was there an ,"I'm sorry". All we kept being told was, "I see"....code for ,"you're a bother and I don't care".

The hotel does have an impressive lobby and lower floor. The rooms do have lovely beds with wonderful sheets. The ceilings are high and if we had wanted a standard room it was quite nice as far as standard rooms go. I really would've been quite happy with hotel had there not been the complete inconsistency in staff and had our accommodations not been so botched. It doesn't matter how magnificent a hotel is if the service is not there. We've stayed at many luxury hotel brand hotels over the years and have never been disappointed until now. The entire point of booking such a hotel is to have the service that one grows to expect. In my opinion the hotel should have comped our stay or made some gesture towards trying to make up for basically what was a lost evening on our first night in San Francisco and was a terrible way to celebrate ours son's 16th birthday evening. Seeing as we were only there for two nights, that was Half of our stay. Our expectations had been to drive in, check-in, freshen up, have cocktails and enjoy a lovely evening out in the city with our children....not babysit a room change with no place to get ready for the night out.

As a side-note, we were told that the hotel will be renovating and be done sometime in the spring. Keep that in mind when booking for this hotel as I'm sure that it will be quite loud on the floors near the construction.</Text>

This is a gorgeous, classy, elegant establishment but I would have greatly appreciated the tip that although parking is $60 over night, in the end that's a steal (no pun intended) because the cost to replace a broken window and lost items due to theft is 15X higher. The neighborhood is not a place to leave a car on the street. Check in would be a good time to warn people of frequent vehicle thefts and break ins, and encourage us to use the garages.</Review>

Just a beautiful interior. Had a drink at the bar. Went to the gift shops and left. Ghirardelli chocolates has a shop in this hotel too.</review>

Even on a busy holiday weekend, each person we interacted with from the Valet, Bell Captain, to front desk was relaxed and calm in a genuine and sincere manner. I love service that is sincere and not forced (like they had just gotten out of a customer service training). We love this hotel for the location and old world elegance.< /Text>

We stayed at the hotel at the beginning and the end of a 2 week trip to California. The service at the hotel was great. The location of the hotel was very convenient to the things we wanted to do. They had coffee in the morning down in the lobby which was very nice to go down and get coffee and tea each morning. The only complaint my husband had was the cost of the valet parking - $59 a night - but we didn't know of any other option.</Text>

Hotel is very old. My room was connected to the room next door by a door. I was having a very normal conversation with my sister when the guest next door started banging on the door asking us to quiet down. I suppose there was absolutely no noise insulation. Given that I paid a premium rate for this hotel I would expect updated rooms and better noise insulation. 
Also the hotel's location was very inconvenient for Uber drop offs, Several times drivers asked me if they could drop me off a block away since there was simply no way to turn over to the street from Market which doesn't' allow non-commercial vehicles. 
There are much better and more convenient SPG hotels in the area that I would choose to stay in before I book here again.</review>

<Rating>None</Rating><text>This was the first time I had experienced the so-called luxury of the Palace Hotel and I was not impressed. Front desk staff were pompous, ill-informed and downright inefficient. It took three phone calls and an hour to get them to deliver keys to the room.

The rooms themselves, at least the two I saw first hand, were in dire need of repair. The in-room information package was a cheap, soiled photocopy, which had obviously been in the room for many weeks, despite the introductory letter saying it was a temporary solution while the permanent materials were being printed.

Breakfast service was poor, slow, inattentive and that's being kind. The staff wasn't able to fulfill a simple request for two cappuccinos before I had completed eating my breakfast despite there being no lack of personnel and very few guests at the time.

The one exception to the string of inadequate experience was the concierge, who was knowledgable, helpful and pleasant. It's a pity the rest of the hotel came nowhere close to her level of professionalism.

I will not be returning to the Palace and definitely recommending that others look elsewhere or be prepared to be disappointed.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Stayed for one night on a business trip. Beautiful common areas. Room was too dark, no light switches just lamps on night stands, barely stumbled through the room. 
Bathroom vent was so incredibly loud and sounded like a tractor all night.
TV kept turning off (going dark) on its in then came back on 2 mins later, so was impossible to even watch anything. 
Confusing long hallways on each floor with exit to elevator lobby not marked properly.< /text>

<Review>I would like to follow-up on a previous experience at the Garden Court last December.

My mother and father came to visit this past weekend and I made a reservation through Jamie Klages for Sunday brunch. The meal was wonderful (fresh food, great variety, attentive service) and our server - Elena - was most helpful and patient (Dad wanted to take pictures and she gladly assisted more than once). At the end of the meal, Jamie took the time and effort to present my mom with a beautiful, fresh birthday / mother's day cake. She also took care of the entire bill (I was expecting just my mother's portion to be complimentary). When we tried the cake, it became apparently how much thought and effort Jamie / the kitchen team took to ensure the ingredients would be compatible with my mother's pallet.

I wanted to express my gratitude for making my mom's birthday/mom day celebration such a memorable one and more than making up for the disappointing experience we had last year.

This is the reason why I have been and will continue to be a supporter of the SPG group. Thank you again.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmap_id></record>

Seems like such a nice hotel, but I found it to be average overall, nothing special. It seemed that no one had been in the room in over a week when I checked-in. The lightbulbs were out so there was no light when I got to my room. There was a note on the desk dating to Dec. 30th and talking about New Years Eve. Just seemed strange and seemed like they didn't put much effort into my stay.< /Text>

<Text>Es un hotel precioso por donde se le mire. Al ser antiguo tiene algunos problemas, cómo las habitaciones que dan a Market St pues las ventanas no son acústicas y se escucha el ruido de los autos y de tranvía. Las habitaciones no están vestibuladas por lo que también se oye el ruido de los pasillos. Los baños son muy pequeños para un hotel de ésta categoría. El servicio es excelente y la comida buena.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Well I just let the valet take my car to the car park. Shortly after I got an email that my car was damaged entering the garage. We'll see how this turns out as this now is an insurance issue.

The insurance company reached out to me right away. Seems to be handled well and responsibly.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Text>When I chose the hotel for a family reunion celebrating my parents 59th wedding anniversaryand my sister's new medical practice, I wanted a place that was fancy enough to impress my parents but it would give my sister and I somethings to do while we were there.
Although I rented a car and San Francisco I didn't realize that this hotel was in front of the central hub of San Francisco Mass. transit.
There is even Ghiradelli's in the lobby serving ice cream and treats much nicer my opinion that the original site at Fisherman's Wharf..

I live in Florida and have a pool that I never use because it is too hot, but I went down to the indoor pool with my sister and family every day and had a blast.

We were there for 10 days and every one of the maids, maintenance people, poolside concierge, reception desk people, valets and bellhops were all helpful, professional and made us feel like family.The place is spotless and the beds and comforters are yummy. My parents can't stop talking about how nice your Hotel is.

I have traveled all over the planet and have stayed at five-star hotels worldwide, but I never had a better time than at the "Palace."</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Great venue; unfortunately, this hotel does not live up to its full potential. Booked the Garden Court via hotel concierge for 2 breakfasts on the 2 mornings I was there. On 2nd day, I was rudely told by the staff attending the Garden Court reservations desk that I had none... so would have to "wait my turn"... Found hair in food, as well as water glasses were dirty! 
Hotel made you sign a letter on arrival stating that all patrons should respect the noise level in corridor after 11 p.m. I can honestly tell you that shouting folks kept me up way past 1h30 a.m. on more than one occasion!! Being a platinum member, they advised there would be a room upgrade... Disapointingly, that room ended up with no view facing an inside opposite hotel wall, not very impressive as to what level of expectations you put out there for Platinum members and what you deliver.</Text><userid>None< /userid>< Time>

For breakfast on the meeting room floor, there were no tables/chairs in the food area. We had to find sofas to crowd onto to eat.

While this is a beautiful hotel, service is substandard. I arrived for a 3pm check in but the room was not ready until 4:30pm which altered the evening's plans since my wife had planned to wash her hair before dinner and the Opera. We settled for a light meal instead of the dinner we had planned. When I called room service for ice it took 45 minutes for it to arrive. I also called the concierge to ask on what TV channel the Thursday night football game could be seen - they didn't know and it took 30 minutes for them to find out and call me back. After breakfast the following morning we returned to our room to discover the electronic lock no longer worked and had to contact security to get back into our room. I really expect more from a hotel of the stature of the Palace.</review>

Next time we come back, we will defineltey be staying there.
Trust me, you will be pleasantly suprised. Just spectacular! Not to mention, fabulous location.</review>< user_name>

<Text>Staying here is always an enjoyable experience. I am happy that each room has a robe and premium bath amenities as well as plenty of towels. It’s the small touches that add to the comfort when staying at this hotel. When back in the area I would certainly return to The Palace hotel.</Text>< Pictures>

The Garden Court restaurant, while a bit expensive, is very elegant and breakfast buffet extremely well done.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

The Palace is a terrific landmark property. Room comfortable, staff pleasant. But housekeeping needs to step up its efforts--minibar, inexplicably, was empty when we arrived, and trash containers in the hallways went unemptied for many hours on end, also room service trays sat on the hallway floors for extended periods..< /review>

The lobby, and dining room was elegant, and reflects the luxury series, however the rooms were small, and poorly furnished. One chair by the desk, and no other chair to sit on. When I called for a chair, an up right dining room chair was brought, which helped. Only one night stand in the room, and lack of counter space in the nth room. A grand hotel in a bygone era. Upgrade to a deluxe room, and the hotel would be very acceptable.</Text>

This is now the third time we have stayed at this hotel and EVERY TIME we have checked in we have been made to wait because our room's carpet has needed to be 'shampooed.' I have been in hospitality management before and when hotels have 'overbooked' themselves, they often give this excuse. We were made to wait over an hour for the room. We were not offered any compensation...no money off, no complimentary breakfast, no complimentary cocktails. When asked by different associates in and around the hotel how are stay was, we told them of the issue, only to hear, "Oh, I'm sorry." No one ever offered to 'make it right.' We were even locked out of our room for the second night and had to wait for security to come up with new scanned keys (being made to wait outside our hotel room until help arrived). We paid way to much money to be treated like this. We will never stay at this hotel again. Ever! I'm sure this review will go unanswered.< /review>

<Review>One of the oldest and most regal hotels in the city. Although I've never stayed overnight the hotel is welcome to all visitors. Whether you wish to sit in the palatial center foyer or sip drinks in the Pied Piper Room with an authentic Maxfield Parish above the bar, a day in the city would be lacking without a stop in the timeless elegance of the Palace Hotel.<//Review>< userid>

Service is top notch, the lobby/main dining area looks amazing. But I came at a very busy time, so I didn't get any upgrade even though I am a platinum member with over 100 nights per year. The standard room is just Ok, very small and I don't like the half shower door concept... Overall I would recommend this hotel but only for non busy season.< /review>

This hotel was recommended by a friend just a day before my trip. I didn't expect much but it was a pleasant surprise especially at the bargain price. The lobby is very luxurious, rooms are elegant but very simple. Bed linens are the top line cotton. I am not sure what is the "thread count" but I am sure it's one of the highest. Towels are not as soft though. Swimming pool and exercise facilities are a nice bonus.</text>

Checked in to a long line and obviously unhappy reception area, no smiles whatsoever, asked for Platinum upgrade was told "we are full" - given a city view room, which was not the Deluxe City View King we had booked and were told again "we are full as you can see". Plat amenity offered were some cookies [ seriously? ], took the points.

The sad state were the rooms, stained and tired old carpets, mold in bathroom grout, bruised and tarnished wooden furniture, dust all over [ corners, everywhere from a foot from the floor, tops of paintings etc. ] I am mildly asthmatic so think twice about this place. Talked to a very friendly housekeeper who confirmed the dire state of affairs at The Palace.

I took many pictures to point out to management, though, again, no response.

Called guest services that window latches were both broken and the AC would not function [ it was a warm and sunny day ] - I was told that we were very busy. Needless to say nobody every returned our call despite having inquired 3 times. Swimming Pool was closed and no alternate facilities were offered.

All in all a very sad state of affairs for the Luxury Collection Hotel and Platinum Recognition was equally pitiful.< /Review>

The front desk receptionist Scott set the tone for a great stay. It's nice to be greeted by year after year by a SPG employee that really goes over and beyond the call of duty. Scott' professional enthusiasm to make the perfect accommodation is genuine, it keeps us coming back year after year. It's the people that make the business.< /Text>

As a business traveler on east coast time, I was hoping to get up in the morning and work prior to attending the conference however the internet connect in the room was horrible and there is no coffee in the room. Climate control in the room was also not great. Wash rooms in common areas required a security code that wasn't provided to guests. Facility is beautiful and food was fantastic. Bed very comfortable but too warm given challenges with climate control< /Text>

The hotel was nice and in a convenient location on Market and close to the Ferry Building and Union Square. I was there for celebrating a special occasion with my wife and did not feel pampered or treated any better than the average customer. I was hoping for some sort of special treatment, a room upgrade, or anything, but it was just average service with no recognition. It was OK, but not a wonderful staff experience.< /review>

Esperamos 50 minutos para desayunar, y le daban prioridad a gente externa al hotel.
Deberian habernos avisado verbalmente que esta situacion podria ocurrir para hacer la reserva.
Las camas son muy chicas.
Desayuno no incluido para mi hijo, cuando la reserva la efectue para 3 personas.
Muy caro el estacionamiento.
Muy mala atencion del personal que atiende el ingreso al desayuno.
Ningun personal de atencion hablaba español.< /Review>

The location of this hotel is perfect! BART is at the side door, SFMOMA is around the block, bus to outer areas is right there as well.
The food in the Pied Piper is really fabulous as is the back room to dine in.
We will continue to stay here. The only "average' score is for the the furnishings and carpet. They truly are in need of updating. The paint is peeling around windows as well.<//review>

Considered the crown jewel of hotels in SF, since being acquired by Marriott it has suffered. Paying top dollar for a small room facing the inside gravel pit was disappointing. Breakfast was the highlight with the Pied Piper delivering sticker shock as compared to years past. It was a good run while it lasted!<//Review>

Upon check-in, I was told that no upgrades of any sort were available, and was given a very small, somewhat nondescript room. While I'm sure larger suites might not have been available, I cannot imagine that a larger room than that I received was not available. The person checking me in did not offer any other amenities in lieu of a room upgrade. Also, as an SPG Platinum member I receive free wi-fi. I was charged for wi-fi and had to contact the front desk to have the charges removed.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Room however was certainly nothing exceptional- relatively small, very surprised that there was no dresser in so called luxury accommodation. TV controls didn't work the first night despite repair man's attempts to fix. The remote was terrible - hard to figure out, very slow to work. Could not understand what actors were saying in an American movie and no way to find closed captions. Front desk said they'd send up someone to help but no one arrived. Excellent heat control. Banquet meal was very unappetizing and strange combination of prawns and short ribs. Satisfactory meeting venue overall but not at all palatial.<//Text>< userid>

What can I say but thank you to you and staff of the Palace Hotel. As always we were made to feel special.
Frances in reservations takes good care of us.
We love SF and Palace hotel. We consider it our home away from home.
We only stay there while in SF.< /review>

Jose, the Chef Concierge, went above and beyond to help me locate some great bead stores and cool vintage boutiques for my first stay in San Francisco. Also, JD gave me some helpful insider tips about taking the BART to the airport. Thank you for a magical and memorable experience!!!</review>

We ordered yogurt and granola with fresh fruit, the pastry basket, coffee, and orange juice at 11:15am on a Sunday morning because room service said they stop serving the full menu (eggs, pancakes, etc.) at 11:00am. The granola seemed like a stale boxed version like General Mills and the fruit was a bunch of cantaloup and honeydew that was not of the greatest quality. The orange juice did not taste like it was fresh squeezed. For $60 for this breakfast at a Luxury Collection, this breakfast should have had higher quality and more specialty ingredients.</text>

<Text>The front desk staff was less than friendly. I had an email offer to upgrade and even though I did, the room I stayed in was not a deluxe room, and this was not explained to me as the front desk guy wordlessly handed me the keys. After entering the room, I went back to the front desk and asked the 2nd front desk person if my room was superior deluxe (or whatever it was they offered) and he told me it wasn't, they sold out of king-sized beds and could only give me 2 queens (which I don't need). I asked them not to charge me for this and he said they wouldn't - but lo and behold I see this charge on my bill 2 weeks later. Horrible - why offer me something that a) sells out then b) charge me for it?< /Text>< gmapID>

This hotel is gorgeous! Go for afternoon tea in the garden court area. It's the perfect place for a girls day or to treat your mom. They also offer sunday brunch with sushi, crepes, omelets, etc but at $85 per person I have not been so lucky to try it.</Review>

<review>Only stayed one night, didn't have the opportunity to experience the property much but it is rather clean although the room carpets in 774 can do with some major cleaning.

Also, is it normal to have had an empty mini bar?

The bed was glorious, extremely comfortable.

Price tag of usd 60 for parking is 26% of room rate. That is steep. 5 star properties shouldn't charge for parking nor should they charge for wifi.

Roland at front desk is an excellent ambassador of the Starwood.</review>< pics>

We also pay with cash. Our room was booked with points. When we arrived on Friday we found we had been upgraded to a luxury junior suite on Market. There was fresh fruit and a gift and a lovely note from Ricardo welcoming us back and thanking us for our loyalty. It was unexpected and a lovely gesture. Thanks also to our favorite concierge, Debbie Lew for her warm greeting and attention. The Palace is a special place with a great staff.

The problem is at the top as the food and beverage manager cannot do the job. Would never stay here again and would tell others to

Im a Lifetime Platinum member and have stayed at the Palace for the last 15 years sometimes 10 to 15 times per year. Just getting ready to book six rooms for Thanksgiving Holiday and saw the changes they made to the Grand Palace. It is not even close to the same place I have know except for the structural building itself. They have taken out the grand antiques and replaced them with some modern decor that does not blend with this building. Also, I got to know the staff by name and they new me as well. Now I hear most are gone. I find myself looking for another Grand Hotel in the Great City of San Francisco.</text>

<review>We recently stayed at the palace... the lobby area is beautiful... It's too bad that they did not have the attention to the detail, cleanliness, etc. to the rooms. We upgraded the room and although it was spacious for a SF hotel room it did not meet my standards at all for cleanliness. The curtains, floor and walls looked dirty and stained. The towels were bare thin and pilled. Not what I expected from this caliber hotel.< /review></record></dataset><record>

We enjoyed our stay here. Our room was very comfortable, and the building is spectacular. In particular our bed was great. Breakfast in the hotel under the glass dome is expensive but worth it for the experience, at least once. The hotel is centrally located and walking distance to key business and tourist destinations, like Moscone center, SF MOMA, the ferry terminal plaza, and Chinatown. There is also a pool and decent looking fitness center, although we didn't use it. We would stay here again.</Text>

This was our second time to stay at the Palace - we love the ambiance, the old world feel and how special we feel when we stay at this hotel. However, on this occasion, our room (765) was not up to par. There was no bidet toilet seat in our room, but the remote control was mounted on the wall(?). Also, we were unable to turn off the TV with the remote - we had to get up and manually turn the TV off using the button in the back. We called the front desk to have this looked at - they said they were going to send an Engineer up, but after 30 minutes we gave up. Lastly, throughout the night, a fan or motor outside of our room, would kick on and disturb our sleep. We were by the elevators so perhaps that was the cause. Regardless of all these factors, we were travelling with our 2 small children and decided to stay in the room having unpacked all our bags. We love the Palace and will probably stay there again, however this stay was not up to the level that we were expecting.<//text>

This was our 2nd time at the Palace and it was wonderful. Only negative was a room service order than didn't get to us in time. I was quoted a delivery time and was short on time. After giving them an extra 10 minutes I had to cancel the order. Other than that we loved it and would go back again.<//review>

<text>The good: Beautiful lobby, great SF location
The bad: the front desk staff and housekeeping. Hotel has nice amenaties in the bathroom, unfortunitly most of them were actually empty when we checked in! After turndown, they were still empty. Echoing what other reviews said, this is another SPG hotel that actively tries not to upgrade platinum members. I booked the hotel late morning of the one-night stay, and there were plenty of upgrade rooms (suites and other upgraded rooms available). Yet when checking in early that evening, the front desk told me they were totally full and couldn't move me. I showed him that on my phone I could still book virutally any room I wanted- the result was him keeping me in the same room type, but moving me from the 5th floor down to the 2nd. I got tired of dealing with him and finally just left, knowing I will never both patronizing the hotel again when there are so many other good options in San Francisco.< /text><Resp>None</Resp><name>Nicole32< /name>< gmapID>

<rating>None</rating><text>Hello
following up conversation the verbal grievance i filed with hotel manager earlier today about having A staff from DC come to see the sites in SFcheck in 1/23/16 check out 1/24/16 )& to make sure we were on schedule with early check in & late check out so i called numerous time check in time issues as well as the full valet parking fee that was waved initially by head office guest hospitality services & i was reassured , however upon the day of our reservation it all fell apart on your end , we had to wait to check in as i called & called with no luck .
The horrible 2 star experience we had staying at the hotel, placing us near noise , hearing demonstration traffic & construction , sirens from the street as well as lack of follow up on the room service & towels & numerous request that they failed to follow up on .
The final straw was the check out telephone encounter experience we had with the entitled front desk manager that spoke with sarcasm as if she was talking to an 8th grader . I am sure you train your staff in hospitality & etiquette.
I tried to dispute the valet & parking charge , not only she did not honor it , she was refusing to help us escalate the inquiry to her boss , even i told her that it was done prior to my arrival by corporate the day before , So we packed our bags & asked to have the paper dropped off in the room & left with my blood boiling of anger & resentment & decided to followed up today with the hotel manager .
I will be writing to your headquarters, yelp & all travel sites & BBB about this humiliating substandard service we received ,unless i am refunded the entire amount paid in full $333.03 that my credit card was charged
No one should be subjected to such low level of customer service & treatment & pay top dollar for it as well!!!!!

<Review>We love the Palace and I have stayed there many times over the yeas. I love the pool and workout facility as well as the rooms. It is disappointing that you do not offer 2 Queen beds. In fact I was told upon checkout that I would be in a room with 2 Queens. I had to wait an hour for it to be cleaned and in the end there were 2 Full Size beds in the room. I also requested a few wine glasses and champagne glasses be put in the room while it was being cleaned and that did not happen.</Review>< Name>

So nice of the front desk staff to offer a scavenger hunt kit to each of our three children. They were encouraged to explore the hotel to find the clues, every hotel staff person we encountered along the way were playful and helpful. They kids had a great time playing this game.< /Text>

The bath tub was very dirty and the water did not drain well. When I showed the first time, my foot was soaked into the dirty water. It was very unpleasant and I reported this to front desk and she promised me to send an engineer to my room and fixed it during the day. When I came back at night and showed it again. The problem still remained. The bath tub remained dirty, and it did not drain neither. I was pretty upset with my stay. And when I called guest service three/four times, it was busy and I never had a chance to speak to anyone over the phone about this issue.</Text>

The Palace is an excellent hotel. Great location.The service was top notch from the doormen, check-in, concierge to housekeeping. It was nice to have the pool/sauna/whirlpool to relax by later in the evening. Could not have asked for a better weekend. Kudos to the Palace!</Text>

Here on a business trip, hotel charges for parking even if you're not parking there. Jacuzzi been broken for a month now, pool to cold to even enjoy that. For top quality hotel they cant seem to take care of the little things.</Review>

<text>Been to many nice San Fran hotels and this was a disappointment with mold around bathtub, stain on room furniture, poor room lighting, weak shower head stream and very poor WiFi connections with constantly getting kicked off WiFi.  Will not return; Fairmont and even Omni are better choices. Staff was nice breakfast solid but was out of complementary morning coffee in lobby nook.</text>< Rate>

<Rate>None<//Rate><review>I stayed at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco for my mom’s 50th birthday, which was noted at the time of making reservation. Note that we live in the Bay Area, so we really didn’t have to stay at hotel. Rather, this is something my mom enjoys, so it was really just to make my mom happy. Unfortunately, the whole experience was a nightmare. 

When I was checking in, the check-in agent gave me a default room that is the lowest category of all. He then later told me he could give me one (1) category upgrade. I was a bit confused — I’m a SPG Platinum member booked under the Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program, so the Platinum best-room upgrade entitlement needs to override the Amex FHR rate upgrade. However, the check-in agent, who was apparently a newcomer, didn’t end up giving us any upgrade, so we were assigned to a default room — although I could see plenty of inventory online on the SPG app. 

As you may know, Amex FHR rate comes with free breakfast, $100 F&B credit and late check-out. We requested a 4pm late check-out during check-in, but then we later discovered that the check-in agent forgot to program our keys accordingly and that our keys will expire at 1pm. We requested a new set of keys on three separate occasions and waited for two hours, but they never arrived and we had to go pick them up ourselves. 

What’s more infuriating happened during afternoon tea service at the garden court. We arrived at the garden court lounge to use our $100 F&B credit at 2pm. We sat and ordered our menu promptly afterwards, but our food didn’t come until 2:50pm! After 50 minutes! They stood us up for 50 minutes with just tea and we were never offered any apologies. It was appalling — and we left the site very, very angry. Again, this was supposed to be all for my mom’s 50th birthday, and it was all ruined. 

The hotel management has been ignoring my calls, voicemail and emails. I had to have Starwood corporate intervene because the hotel management was so bad. 

Stay away.<//review>< Pictures>

This is my second time staying at the Palace hotel. I really did want to love it more than I did. I wonder at what point a "Grand and Historic" hotel just turns into an OLD hotel. Let's keep in mind that this hotel is marketed as a "luxury collection" hotel which is a special designation of Starwood hotels. I expected more from this hotel. The halls were wide and the decor of the hotel gave you that old world feeling. It was quite nice. However, the rooms are on the small side. Even that would be OK but for a Luxury Collection hotel I didn't expect to see stains on the furniture, chips in the paint around the room, marks on the walls, etc. The beds were comfortable and the shower pressure was great. The hotel exit it about 5 feet from the Mongomery Bart/Muni stop as well.</text>

<Text>The staff was not courteous at the Garden Court. My wife and kids got the worse treatment possible. We have been treated better at less expensive non luxury hotels. We left the hotel a night early since my wife and kids could not stand the humiliation at the buffet. I do not think the staff likes lil kids and is definitely not going to be on my list next time. It was my preferred choice going in to SFO since my daughter loves castles/palaces and she was in awe. But I think she left w/a bad taste as well. She is just 4.5 yrs old. I had to also stop by the front desk multiple times or call multiple times to tend to simple requests like plz change the bed linen and/or provide me with a kettle if microwaves are not available for warming milk for my 18 month old. We did let our concerns know at the front desk and they apologized but it also felt half hearted. We just think we got the cold shoulder from everyone we talked or interacted at the hotel not sure why. We have stayed at a lot of hotels and this was our 1st experience at a Starwood hotel and am not sure if we enjoyed it a bit. I am still so infuriated and frustrated at how this all went down and only conclusion I can draw is that being in SFO financial district hotels don't care bout family travelers since they cater to business folks and like to be least maintenance .<//Text>< Pictures>

First, the Good. The Hotel is in a great location. On Market Street-- right next to a Bart Station and an F-Line Trolley car stop. A+++ The surrounding area felt safe and there were plenty of stores and restaurants. The Hotel itself immediately impresses with the architecture and grand entrance. A+++

Now, the Not-so-good. Once the initial blush of the grand entrance wears off, you really begin to notice the dirty and worn carpet, bubbling plaster and dirty paint and general wear and tear on the fixtures and woodwork. C-

The rooms are comfortable, but lack some of the conveniences you expect from new hotels.

I was extremely surprised to find that they charge for internet access in the room. Wired or wireless. I guess they feel like it is OK since most of the guests are business people and they expense it. D-. It felt like 10 years since the last time I paid for internet in a hotel.

The room had no in-room coffee pot. Again, I can’t remember the last time I stayed in a hotel without one. I like to have my first cup of coffee, before I’m ready to get dressed and venture out to a coffee shop. D.

The room had no microwave. Again seems like forever since I stayed in a hotel without one. D.

The bathroom had no vent fan. Which made it very steamy for quite a while after taking a shower. C.

AND the refrigerator that was in the room seemed to have only 2 settings—OFF and Frozen. Everything I put in the refrigerator froze one night and thawed the next after I tried to turn it down. F.</text>

Classic, elegant hotel that is not reaching it's potential (or previous glory) due to obnoxious nature of aggressive protestors picketing out in front.  Crew that is presently servicing hotel was polite and well-intentioned, however spread too thinly to be fully effective.</Review>

Man oh Man..What a nice travel back in to time without a time machine..What a joy the spend your time..The restaurant option within hotel can not be beat.   The staff very warm and enviting.  The joy of just sitting and taking in the feel of the warmth of the space.  Any reason to come back would be welcomed.< /text>

On arriving the hotel gives a great impression. The rooms however are disappointing being very small and noisy, being able to hear the guest in the neighbouring room. Upon checkout the billing procedure was poor being charged for prepaid rooms that had been booked direct, delaying our departure. It's location suited us but I wouldn't choose to stay here again.</Review>

I loved my stay, it was perfect with the Chinese New Year Parade, and the front desk clerk was so nice and helpful and changed my room so that we were right on the parade route and could see! The only issue was that the floor did not seem very clean at all! The floor in the bathroom looked like they forgot to sweep! I never went barefoot!</Review>

I was so unimpressed except for the person who checked me in. After that, it was all down hill.

The room was unimpressive with few amenities.
No turndown, no bathroom, easy to hear noise from other rooms, the thermo stat didn't work well.

The following day, i called for a bathrobe. It never came. I called guest services and asked if i went down to the restaurant for brunch if i needed a reservation for one person. They said probably not and would alert the manager. When I went down, the restaurant told me they weren't even serving until 11am. i was not happy to receive wrong information. i wound up eating in the other restaurant which was dark and loud and not where i wanted t o eat.
really unimpressed, i have to say.</text>

<review>Kept waiting for check in. Delays for room readiness not shared until after nearly 3 hour wait for carpet cleaning. Should have been directed to baggage storage so we didn't lose half our first day in SF awaiting a room, but was told our room prep was "expedited." Room upgrade not consistent with previous upgrades. Emailed in week of scheduled arrival to pay for upgrade, when it is a part of platinum status to be upgraded automatically at check in reservations permitting. Pool/gym area poorly or unattended. The Sunday brunch impressed as usual, but I can get that without staying at the Palace. Might be time to change stay plans. In the city fairly frequently for personal and professional reasons.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The Palace offers a complimentary shoe shine. I left my shoes on the bag and called downstairs as directed requesting a return by 7:00am. I called back down at 7:30am as my shoes had not yet been delivered. At 8:00, they were delivered to my door wrapped in paper, but still scuffed with no shine. I notified management and no action was taken.

As a Platinum, I was given room 219, next to the elevator with a view of another room despite that fact that many upgraded rooms remained available.</Text>

<review>The hotel is very interesting and has a spectacular dining room to look at. However, we had the breakfast buffet, which was awful. The food was cold, we had no server. I asked the woman who seated us for help and we at least got coffee. Everyone was too busy trying to set up for the brunch. To top it all off it was $32,50 each. Never again. The room was OK, but nothing meriting the price we paid.</review>< Resp>

<resp>None< /resp><text>Being the General manager of a hotel in Beverly Hills, I had high expectations and the Palace did not fail to deliver. The reception staff was exceptional, the room attendant that serviced my room was detail oriented and all the staff that I encountered were friendly and welcoming. My only feedback would be in regards to the maintenance of the room. The magnifying mirror was missing but the base was still hanging on the wall and the bathroom phone was also missing. Everything else was up to standards.<//text>< user_id>

The hotel is great but VERY expensive. Although they didn't charge me the RIDICULOUS $15.00 Dlls a day for WIFI service) I was shocked with the $38.00 Dlls plus taxes for the price of the buffet breakfast. Service was great, especially Elena at the dining court.

Would have expected some more attention for being a SPG customer.<//text>

The bed was comfortable and the room had an antique charm.
Strangely the cleaning staff removed the shower liner the day before checkout, so showering and keeping water off the floor was difficult.
I had issues with the credit card I had with me. Front desk could not accept a number then provided inaccurate directions to provide another CC number via e-mail.
Any change to billing (business trip) took a long time to process, and every change required re-issue of card keys.<//Text>

<text>I liked everything about the hotele xcept the following inconviniences:

- Guest Wifi does not work well. There was hardly any network in my room
- The black alarm box in my room was set for 4 AM and it rang and disturbed my sleep
- The pillow had some sort of old clothes smell
- The bathroom sink was clogged and water would not drain fast<//text><rate>None<//rate>< userid>

<rate>None< /rate><review>I chose The Palace for its easy access from SFO. Its 30 minutes on BART to Montgomery Station, and well located for walking to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, & the Embarcadero. Check in was not great - poor SPG recognition & knowledge of how Platinum program works. Our room was large but cold! (the temp never budge off 60 degrees Fahrenheit over two days!). Also, the exercise room was disappointing - a poor selection of exercise machines, no exercise ball, no remote!).</review>< Pictures>

We've stayed at the Palace Hotel for some years now and it's still our hotel of choice in San Francisco. We love the ambience and ths staff is great - from the parking valets to the front desk, we are made to feel welcome. The concierge staff has always been helpful. During ouf recent stay, we found the Pied Piper bar to have become so noisy that it's not pleasant to stop for an evening cocktail. Maybe some changes could be made to have a lower noise level? Our room was short on drawer space but otherwise was just fine. The hot tub seems a bit dated and could use some attention.< /Text>

I've only been here for events in the Grand Ballroom and to Tea.  So this review is based on those experiences, which have been superior!  Tea at the Sheraton Palace should be on everyone's bucket list.  The room is over the top elegant, as is the service.  This experience sets you back to another place and time, it is truly a respite from the frantic life we all seem to be rushing around in.  Reservations for tea are a must.< /Text>

<text>The Palace Hotel is a beautiful landmark property with a lot of history, mystery, and snobbery. The stain glass ceiling in the dining room is an impressive piece of art that everyone should see. The restaurant's food is delicious served by an impressive team of waiters. The hotel staff are very helpful but the management is rude and treat guest with no respect.< /text>< Pics>

This is a piece of Old San Francisco History. It's a lovely place. I bring all my out-of-town guests here for brunch at the Garden Court.< /review>

<review>We had not stayed in the palace for years but the location is now better than the St. Francis as you are 5 mins from Union Square, 1 block from MOMA and museums, short walk to farmers market and The Embarcadero. Rooms are renovated and spacious. We had a lovely king bed, but the pillows were high foam and drapes didn't quite close making sleep a bit tough. . The Palm Court is just as impressive as ever and Maxwells is a livelier mature bar scene. Staff were wonderful immediately fascilitating a solution to a problem we had. Parking is $59 and it's not easy as there are only a couple of slots on busy Montgomery street for valet parking, and you have to double park. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be looking to the palace rather than Union Square hotels.</review><Gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb<//Gmap_id><Date>1399248000000<//Date>< Resp>

<review>This hotel was really beautiful with true character and history. We very truly enjoyed our stay here; the one thing that we found unpleasant was that we could hear everything that happens in the hall. We had people carry conversations a few doors down early in the morning, and the conversation carried itself very clearly and loudly into our room, and woke us up. Similarly, housekeeping staff members speaking to each other up and down the hall were also very vividly echoed in the room. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem if it did not happen at 7am in the morning.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Attended for a conference and you get the early 1900 feel for sure with the beautiful entrance and atrium.  Cant speak to the stay or the rooms or amenities, but as conferences go the meeting rooms are huge, staff is capable of ensuring the various tech equipment work, etc.</review>

<Text>My daughter and son-in-law used my starwood points for a special weekend in San Francisco. My son-in-law is an active duty marine home on leave from Afganistan. I telephoned the hotel to see if there was anything that they could do to make his stay special. The did absolutely the minimum that they would do for any other regular customer. I was disappointed that The Palace could not or would not try to do something special for this marine protecting our country.< /Text>< Time>

<review>Outstanding hotel with extremely helpful staff. However, reserved room was not available or ready at 4:00 pm, the guaranteed check in time. The guaranteed check in does not mean you will get your room at 4:00 pm at this hotel. I was told at 3:00 the room was vacant and being cleaned, and at 4:00 I still did not have a room.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Both the Pied Piper Bar and the Garden Court are amazing places. However, the service staff should try, at minimum, to pretend they want to be there -- almost feel like we were a bother to be served. Perhaps, a smile will also be helpful.</Review>

< Review>
I was extremely disappointed by my recent stay at the Palace. The hotel is no where near the standard of what I expect from Starwood. Relative to my recent stay at the Westin Gaslamp in San Diego, this hotel was falling apart. The carpets were filthy, the lock to my room did not work properly, TV in my room did not work properly and the lights in the hallway wereout in several places. There was no coffee service and or minibar in the room. The in hotel dining options were limited. While the location is convenient, there was a constant stream of homeless people camped out in various parts of the massive lobby.

I would not stay at the palace again unless there are significant upgrades made.</Review>

<text>My wife and I stayed at The Palace using points, and a SNA (Suite Night Award). I chose The Palace based on other reviews, it's location, and the prestige of staying in a Luxury Collection hotel. Our suite upgrade was granted a few days in advance, and upon arrival we stepped into the shorter SPG line.

Check-in was very smooth, and we were actually upgraded from our upgrade to a superior suite, and chose free breakfast as our amenity. We were located on the 4th floor in a corner location adjacent to Market and New Montgomery,which provided a great view.

The suite was very spacious, with high ceilings and plenty of room. It also had an adjacent sitting room, the same size as the bedroom. The sitting room held a couch, two chairs, a work desk, and a cabinet with another TV on it. There was also a fireplace in the wall, although I doubt it was ever functional recently - just meant for show. The sitting room would be a great place to entertain a group or function; a lot more space than two people would require.

As others have mentioned, the walls of the rooms are very thin. We heard our neighbours quite often through the bathroom wall, as they were a young couple and quite loud in talking and laughing - the only thing we could do was make sure our bathroom door was shut at night to minimize disruption.

Being an older hotel, it is difficult to find plugs in some locations, but it still has it's charm. The Garden Court was closed for cleaning our first day, so we took breakfast in the sports bar, and the Garden Court thereafter.

Breakfast was my only complaint - it was common to arrive for breakfast in the morning and wait between 15 to 30 minutes to be seated, despite plenty of open tables. The Maitre'd didn't seem to be too organized - often seating people who arrived more recently before others, with people continually asking where they were on the list in order to make sure they weren't skipped.

After being seated, it would take several minutes for a waiter to appear; when they did they would take our breakfast card and provide us with coffee and orange juice… and then never visit our table again. If you wanted more coffee or juice, you'd be better off getting it yourself. It was as if they intentionally avoided everyone but paying customers. The setting of breakfast was beautiful, though!

Clarity on the free breakfast was missing as well - Day 1 we were told we could have everything - both hot and cold meals from the buffet. Day 2 we were only permitted a continental, with no hot food. Day 3 we were permitted all cold buffet items, plus half of the hot items. We were always paranoid about whether or not we would be charged for getting something outside of our included breakfast, which was $7/person more.

The gym and pool are a great feature as well - with plenty of machines in the gym (24 hours), and a large pool (until 10pm). There was a large number of families at the hotel when we were there, which filled up the pool every evening and night - if you're looking for laps go early.< /text>< pictures>

<review>The Palace is full of old world charm that is often missing from newer properties. It used to be my first choice in San Francisco. Starwoods new policy of attempting to embarress guests into "going green" with arm twisting by front desk staff while checking in will make me consider different chains in the future.<//review><user_id>None< /user_id>< rating>

We always stay at this hotel when we come to San Francisco. This time my husband and I were given a room with two double beds. We were very uncomfortable! A king bed would have been nice! The air in the room did not work and then to top things off, there wasn't a hair dryer. This hotel is always just okay. I stayed because of my Starwood membership but I am not seeing any rewards. I won't return.</review>

The hotel should have told me there was a strike going on.   First, not everyone is comfortable crossing a strike for personal or political reasons.  Second, the strike created a lot of noise and made me feel like I was being held hostage in the hotel, as every time I left I was screamed at.  Thirds, the hotel was not full service.  There was no room service.  It was obvious the maid service was weak.  I found women's underwear on my bathroom floor.   I had ZERO toiletries.    And I called to get someone to come up and no one ever showed up.    The whole thing felt forced and was not comfortable.    The price point is ridiculous for what essentially is a 4 Points hotel (zero service).    They should have closed rooms to maintain service.  Short term gains will not pay off.</Review>

Classic elegance meets tech-ified rooms - we had a heated toilet seat with water spray and drier, operated by a remote control. Delicious breakfast in a sunny and spacious setting add to the allure.< /text>

Lack of coffee machine and tight room made the stay a little difficult but other than that the quality of the experience and the hotel are outstanding</Review>

While valet parking at $72 per night seems expensive it did include in and out privileges. The room we had was clean and comfortable and the Toto toilet came with washlets and dryers. Every service person we encountered was friendly and helpful.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /Gmap_id>< userid>

1. Gross garbages in the hallway. When I first checked in at around 4pm yesterday, I saw a garbages(leftover food from room services, bags..) at the hallway. It was 4pm. It was not even early check-in. Today(12/24), I saw them and they were still there. In the afternoon, still there. After having dinner at Pied Piper at 8:40pm, they were still there. Nobody cleaned them for more than a day. Every time I pass the hallway on my way to room, I saw gross leftover stuck in the dish.
2. I talked to the hotel front an hour ago about this but they are still there. He said they will clean right away but maybe right away meant tomorrow for him.

Pied Piper.
1. I checked online that Pied Piper has Christmas Eve menu so I came down to ask when it starts. I asked the server(female) when Christmas Eve menu starts but the answer I got from her was “I don’t know”. I was stunned. I waited for other servers or manager for a couple minutes and asked the same question to a gentle man(looks like a manager, grey hair, tall in a suit) and the answer was “I don’t know but maybe 4pm. I am going to check and let you know”. He never came back. I waited for 15 minutes and left the restaurant. 
2. Anyway I came to the Pied Piper to have Christmas Eve Menu. There were bread plates and butter knives for both of us on the table. I thought I would be served some bread since there were tablewares. A server brought the first course(salad) so I asked “Do you have bread? There are bread plates and butter knives but we have not served bread yet.” The answer I got was “Yes, Do you want some bread?”. I think she should have asked before serving the first course. 
3. Pied Piper Christmas Eve Menu has 4 courses. We had 2 forks and 1 desert fork for a tableware when we started our meal. One for the first course(Salad), and the other one for the second course(Ravioli). After finishing the second course(Ravioli), the server took the plate with the fork. Later, she brought the third course(Beef short rib) without fork and we had to wait for a couple minutes to call the other server(we could not even find her) again and get the forks. (Even worse, the other server did not know where to put the fork. She put the fork right next to the knife.)
4. I finished my third course before my wife. The server came and took my plate. That’s Ok. But the thing is, she brought desert plates for my wife and me even before my wife finished the third course.
5. During our dinner, our water glasses were never filled without request. Water glasses were always empty. The worse thing was, every time I requested water, I had to ask at least two servers twice or three times. The servers do not remember(or care) what I asked for. The server even took my cup to the kitchen to refill it. 
6. After finishing our dinner, the server brought the check. There was no pen with the check. We again waited for 5 more minutes to get A PEN.< /Text>

<text>We checked in on the evening before Christmas Eve and we had reserved two rooms. There was no bellman to open the door or carry our luggage. We got to our rooms and one smelled of must and the chairs had stains and the bathroom floor did not appear clean. We called to the front desk only to be kept on hold for 15 minutes. In the meantime we were locked out of our other room and housekeeping called security 3 times and 30 minutes later they appeared. Through this ordeal we were made late to dinner reservations and to return our vehicle to the car rental place. The public areas are beautiful but the rooms are not kept up as they should regardless of their motif. This hotel left a lot to be desired and the staff did not make the stay at all pleasant. For the price it was a disappointment.<//text>< Rate>

Thank you to the Palace for helping to ensure my wife's 40th birthday was memorable and special. The staff were efficient, courteous and personable, and included a complimentary "birthday surprise" of champagne and cheesecake in our room. Highly recommended. We will stay here again.</Text>

<Text>I've stayed here twice - great location, great staff, and comfortable rooms. However, the walls are thin and you can hear people walking/talking in the hall way. What I found most dissappointing is the quality of the breakfast (continental + additional omelet/hot food station). The food tasted bland, about the same as any average hotel, not on par with this "luxury collection" hotel. If I had known about the food, I would've opted for points instead of free breakfast, and go to any other restaurants nearby.<//Text>< Pictures>

The Palace Hotel in San Francisco is a gem- The staff is excellent, the room comfortable and attractive, breakfast at the Palm Court is an experience not to be missed! I had dinner at the Pied Piper Restaurant inside the hotel- excellent and a charming spot to eat. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco,<//Review>

Our favorite hotel in San Francisco is the Palace Hotel. We stay there a few times a year and always enjoy the experience. This last stay we had special support from Teresa at the Front Desk. She went out of her way to make our stay positive and we appreciated her attention to detail. We look forward to our next stay at the Palace.< /text>

<Text>I visited while the workers' strike action was taking place, and I have several complaints to make about how the current situation was being handled by the hotel management:

1. Failure to inform arriving guests of the ongoing strike and how this affects room service and amenities, while providing the option to cancel the booking: I would have expected to be informed ahead of my stay that the strike was going on and given the opportunity to make a different choice. I went to San Francisco for the weekend to relax, but the stay was anything but relaxing given the current circumstances, and the service both at breakfast and for housekeeping as performed by substitute staff was much below the usual standard I had previously experienced.

2. Insufficient "gestures" made by hotel management to make up for inconveniences: offering a "discounted" (yet still expensive) breakfast rate during which the service was absolutely dreadful (I asked for a cappuccino three times and kept being ignored, my cell phone was removed from my table while I went to grab food, I had to repeatedly ask for cutlery as my table was set without any) and a happy hour that is not at all attractive to non-drinkers was simply not good enough. I would have at least expected to not be charged for in-room wifi as this would have been a more useful "gesture of goodwill" than anything else that had been on offer.

I would like to make clear that I empathize with the employees on strike and have been appalled by how the ongoing issue has been treated by both the Palace Hotel's management and the Marriott Group in general. Encouraging hotel guests by means of the note left in the hotel rooms to call the police department(to complain about noise levels represented another low for me and significantly lowered my respect for this hotel. I doubt that I will visit again in the near future.<//Text>< user_name>

I stayed for one night during a business trip and had a great experience. My room was ready before the usual check-in time, the staff was very helpful, the room was clean and comfortable and I didn't have any problems whatsoever. The manager also helped me re-book my stay, after my initial trip was postponed due to bad weather at home.< /review>

<rating>None< /rating><text>Had a great time at the Palace for a short romantic getaway.

Staff were particularly good this time. One of the maids gave us a couple of extra water bottles, and they cooperated very well one day when we were under the weather and only left the room for a little while.

We had a package coming from another Starwood property which didn't get to the Palace before we checked out. Palace staff notified us when they received the package, and forwarded it on to our home promptly.

In general, everyone was very courteous and friendly, at the front desk, bell desk, and concierge. And of course the hotel is gorgeous!</text>< pics>

<Text>My room was impeccable, the staff was super helpful and cheerful, the hotel was beautiful. But I was there for a business conference and couldn't believe that I had to pay for Wi Fi in my gorgeous room! And that even though it was super expensive, all my devices were not synched - in order to get my e-Reader to be able to download, I went through a long and complicated conversation with the help desk, who ultimately couldn't help. Again, the person I dealt with was bright and personable, but I couldn't download a book because I couldn't connect the tablet to WiFi. Are you kidding me? I normally stay at inexpensive hotels for business travel - and their FREE Wi Fi links up seamlessly... the Palace really should fix this, considering they they're in the Tech Epicenter of the world.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<Review>Stayed three days upon checking into the room 2 things stood out as been thought out very poorly in the renovation.

1) In double bed room - no drawer space to store clothes for extended stay. There is easily room in the closet for some drawers. The small case on the night stand is not enough.

2) no coffee machine in the room - this should be standard for luxury hotel. Staff when I called did delivery one to the room. I am still surprised.
3) no mirror outside of bathroom for when multiple guest use the room.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Broken AC. Broken TV. Both took over and hour before an engineer could come and take a look and then over a day to fix (gave up on AC).

Was moved to a smaller room with 2 full beds as a result of room fault and not offered any apology or compensation.

If you care passionately about paying 25 dollars for a cocktail in what is admittedly a beautiful lounge - go ahead. If you actually want basic hotel service (maids who don't shout at each other in the hallways all afternoon, service that can remember to call you when food arrives or basic amenities like AC or a working television) - stay somewhere else.

Not even close to a category 6. Hotel management should be ashamed of themselves and their staff.</Text></record>

The hallway is right off the door so you hear every screaming uncontrolled child. It's a favorite for brunch and I like the live musicians that they sometimes have in the evenings. Its value for money at this premium location and setting.<//review>< pics>

I live in San Francisco and booked this stay to celebrate my 500th night in a Starwood property. When I checked in at 2pm, the upgraded room to a junior suite was not ready and I was told I would be phoned when it was. This never happened and in the end I checked back later and it was ready at 3.30. When I asked if there was any special amenity with a 500th night, I was told I could have a bottle of red wine or a selection of local beers sent to my room. Later that day, 2 bottles of Anchor Steam were sent to my room. Making things worse, the Plt amenity of breakfast was at first not accepted in the restaurant and only after a 15 minute interruption to contact the front desk, this was granted. Service on the whole was lacking, very uncharacteristic of a Luxury Collection Hotel. In summary, a very disappointing stay and unfortunate way to celebrate my 500th night with the chain.</text>

<Review>Stayed for 5 days in a standard room. While this room was not majestic (assuming most of the renovations have been for pricier rooms), the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom amenities top notch. The location is outstanding, and service and valet parking was great. The biggest disappointment was the pool - too much chlorine to swim in it and the area is not as grand looking as the picture on the website.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The hotel was excellent- we were met by very helpful valets/doormen, the woman at the check-in desk was so friendly and efficient- we were talking about one of us celebrating a birthday and very shortly after we arrived in our rooms a split of champagne and wonderful dessert were delivered! We also had requested connecting rooms which were provided for us- we loved the rooms which have been fully updated and were beautiful- we will definitely stay there on our next visit to San Francisco!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>You want to like the Palace because there just aren't that many hotels like this anymore; but a recent stay shows why. Great spaces downstairs don't alter the fact that the rooms upstairs are tiny, and awkwardly constructed so that you hear every noise in the long hallways. So you get grandeur, but you give up comfort.

That's not management's fault-- barring a huge renovation, I can't see how 2014 hotel guests are going to be pleased with a lot of the rooms, which are tiny and noisy (and I suspect that they were awkwardly cut up at some point in the past from larger rooms)

What is management's problem was the long line of folks waiting to check in, while the front desk staff mysteriously did the full "let me orient you to the hotel and San Francisco" for each guest. They spent five minutes and more per check in, a process that can be done in sixty seconds (if the reservation is correct)-- exceptionally irritating as folks waited 45 minutes to check in.

So a suggestion to check in staff: if there's a long line of folks waiting to check in, get it done as fast as possible. You have a concierge desk that can help people if they have questions about the restaurant or the hotel; check in staff doesn't have to play tour guide when a long line of folks is waiting. I think management assumes that this is part of a "welcoming experience" -- but mostly it irritates the folks who're hoping to get to their room after a long trip.

Recommendation: the hotel's facilities have character that you can't duplicate today, the Pied Piper Bar is a step back into history, the fast disappearing world of American mid-century. But I'd much rather stay nearby at two other properties in the Starwood portfolio, the Westin or the St Regis, and have a drink at the Palace . . .</Text>< Response>

<Review>The location to downtown was perfect, the lobby beautiful. I was surprised our room wasn't ready at check in time and we had to wait almost 1 1/2 hours to check in. Little inconvenient and surprising for such a luxury hotel. Room staff were very attentive.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Beautiful old school luxury hotel with some intriguing history, but the rooms are a bit dull and stuffy compared to other luxury collection properties.</Review>

Valet isn't complimentary and it was pretty confusing to find the parking structure. The staff is friendly and approachable. Overall not a bad hotel but it definitely could be better.< /Review>

< Review>
Terrible experience. It is completely unethical how Marriott is handling the stike going on at its SF hotel. They have consciously decided to NOT tell guests before they arrive that there is no room service, no bellman, no hotel services ... and in my case my room was only cleaned one out of two days (and I had to ask for it that day). The HVAC in my room was not working, two trips to the front desk weremet with ... nothing ... it was never fixed.

At check out I expressed my concerns to the front desk person. They apologized and said it is all out of their control. I will never ever stay here again. At the end of the day I was asked to pay 1700 for a crappy room that wasn’t clean, in a hotel with none of its advertised services available. Dispicable.

Hopefully Amex will take care of this when I put the charge in dispute. Fine Hotels and Resorts needs to know that they are recommending terrible experience to guests that expect more.</Review>

I also caught my new stockings on the velco that holds the bedskirt on--which ruined them and cost me $15. Fresh carpet, a new coat of paint and some thoughtful details would be a big improvement.</review>< pics>

This is the 40th time I have stayed at this hotel and was very disappointed in the hotel. The staff did not have accurate registration information for us. I have stayed in many rooms and this was the smallest room I have ever stayed in on your property when we had booked a Junior Suite. I kept being told you were full so I guess you no longed need my business and you made me feel that as a SPG Member I am not important.<//Review>

Incredible, professional, friendly and courteous service from the entire staff. It was my birthday and I received a card from the manager, including strawberry covered chocolated and flowers. Every whim was accomodated by staff. From the bell gentleman, concierge, check in staff, cleaning ladies, gym staff, all provided excellent service with a smile. Will stay here each time I come to San Francisco.</review>

The only positive things I can say about the Palace Hotel are the location and its historical nature and the lobby decor. However, as a hotel that's supposed to be a luxury hotel, it falls way below the mark!! The front desk staff was atrocious. I waited 10 minutes in line, then some person just walked up to the front desk out of nowhere, as it was my turn; and the staff member went ahead and helped her and not me!! No apologies. Nothing. What's up with that?! Then, my room had a great view of a wall of the next building! The room was in need of repair with peeling paint, dirty floors. Housekeeping did not clean the bathroom daily. There was no turndown service (I admit, a frivolity, but with the high room rate and the supposed quality of the hotel, I would have expected it). The pool and fitness center were run down. I could have had better service at a lesser "quality" hotel.< /review>

Rooms are decently sized with very comfortable beds. Bathrooms are a bit small, but very clean and come with all the expected amenities. Wifi is free if you are a member of SPG, otherwise premium speeds (20/2) require extra payment. Friendly staff and overall a great experience. Would stay again.</Text>

We had not stayed at The Palace when visiting SF for a few years and were very happy with the cleanliness and care given to this beautiful building. The Front Desk welcome was great, housekeeping was friendly and helpful, as was the bell staff and garage. The only glitch was a breakfast experience in The Garden Court one morning. They weren't that busy, yet the hostess chose to chat at length with some people at a table after having said hello to us and leaving us standing. The server was almost rude and did not ask about any choices we might have, he simply took our order and walked away, I had to go find him at the buss station to specify rye toast with the eggs; he had not asked a preference. The eggs over medium came cooked to death (wife ate them). It was just really, really unprofessional and off-putting. THAT entire situation can be improved upon. LOVELY hotel otherwise.<//review>

P ubic hairs on the toilet, urine on the toilet seat from previous guest, hairs on the shower wall, hairs on the bathroom wall, paint on ceiling cracked, extremely dirty carpets, and the rooms have a musty smell to them. There was a glass in the hallway for over 14 hours. The staff doesn't seem to have any standards. Service in the bar was bad at night, good during the day.

I wouldn't go if I were you. This hotel should not be part of the Luxury Collection by Starwood.<//Review>< pictures>

This hotel is overly expensive for the experience and the amenities. I stayed at another downtown hotel for part of my stay, and found it to be a much more enjoyable experience. There are no amenities especially given the high room rate, and the room is basic and outdated. This could be such a gem -- but is being outpaced by other hotels willing to make the investment to keep their properties current (style, comfort and expected amenities). I will not stay here again.<//Review>

<review>Unfortunately, I had a less than typical experience. I had to leave or contact front desk for replacement remote, and only after the third call did it happen.

There was a long hair on the bathroom wall, which happens but overall everything else was very clean.

One of the servers in the Bar was rude and ignored my party. However, upon complaining to his manager I was comped the round of drinks and provided a new server who was excellent. Food was great.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ordered room service and the kids pancake was extremely dry, yet one of them has an uncooked middle portion that you really bite into the batter.
My mushroom omelette was horrible. Egg felt and tastes like that synthetic window display version. Bacon extremely over-cooked as if it was a re-fried left over from the day before. And I paid $74??? That's highway robbery!< /Review>

We had a great time at the Palace. A few things could be improved. The person that checked us in was rude and very abrupt. We asked for a room that was on the quiet side but the rooms don't seem to be sound proofed. I could here our neighbors very clearly. We noticed that there were no vending machines or at least somewhere to get a soft drink other that room service. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay and will return.</text>

A pretty standard hotel in the SPG Luxury Collection (which is a good thing). We only stayed one night but were treated to the customary excellent service I would expect for a "4-star" SPG property. The rooms are on the small side, but that's normal for downtown SF. A little surprising is the lack of coffee makers in-room, though apparently you can call the (very responsive) front desk and have one brought to your room. There is free coffee for guests in the lobby from 6am to 10am, which is a slightly narrow window. The design and ornamentation feels quite high end without being outright gaudy as you might see in some more expensive hotels. The location is superb.<//Text>

<text>For being such a luxurious hotel and a beautiful one at that it was just an expensive stay at an average place with a view of a wall. The way over priced breakfast I had wasn't even worth going for seconds.< /text></record></dataset><record>

My request for early check-in was honored. The rooms are impeccable, the staff are courteous and helpful. And of course the lobby atrium is just a piece of art itself. I try to stay at the Palace hotel whenever I travel to SF.<//Text>

There was an error on my reservation but Maka handled it well (I probably didn't complete my reservation on line) Greeted me at the front with my car beautifully, front desk handled my mistake, got a room without delay, delicious food, comfortable room and bed, wide hallways, great pool. Can't wait to come back. Location is ideal.<//review>

Too bad that such a magnificent property is so poorly staffed. The most helpful people were the valets out front. Tried to order late-night room service and after waiting 1 1/2 hrs Ubered to a 24-hour diner. Reached out to front desk before leaving the hotel in the middle of the night and was told, "Oh...sorry for your inconvenience."<//Review>

Overall, a good stay although it fell short of my expectation in terms of room amenities for a hotel that is part of the luxury collection. Basic amenities such as bedroom slippers and coffee/tea making facilities are just some of the items that the room was lacking. The bathroom was small and didn't quite have sufficient tabletop space or hanging spots. There was only a small window with insufficient sunlight coming through and the room didn't have enough lighting. Definitely not conducive for business travelers who may need to conduct business work in the room. Having said all the above, the bed was very comfortable and I felt well rested. In summary, there is a sense of grandeur in the common areas of the hotel; however, it didn't feel quite the same when it came to the room.< /Review>

It's a nice hotel, but next time I'll stay at a Westin and go to the Palace for breakfast. As a SPG Gold, I was hoping for a better room other than the 2nd floor inner with no view. There was no attempt to find a room on a higher floor or one with a view to the south or west.< /text>

This historic hotel is HUGE, but that doesn't take away from the incredibly intimate and warm feeling of this beautiful facility. Incredibly tasteful furnishings and appointments, and the staff was uniformly warm and helpful, right down to the wonderful housekeeping staff. I would return in a heartbeat.<//Text>

At or near the worst hotel I've stayed in.

I came up to my room after i checked in and discovered the beding was down.  Being super alergic to feathers i needed to have them changed.  It took two calls to housekeeping before they came, and had me leave the room only to just dump some ikea pillows and fleece blankets at the foot of the untouched bed.  I took all the feather stuff off and stuffed the bedding in the corner.  The next day my bed was remade with all the bedding in the room, and i had to call twice again to get it changed and specifically asked to have the down bedding removed.

The remade bedding was colder then what was left last night, and the thermoatat only goes to 75F.  I woke up at 4am shiverring, unable to sleep from them, and called down to the front desk to get it set higher and a space heater brought up.  A guy from engineering turned up and explained the thermostat is locked that way, and all he could do was disable the cold water to the AC.  He found me a space heater.

After two horrible nights sleep I'm at least not freezing, but the down remnants left it the sheets makes for an itchy sleep.</Text>

<review>The entrance and lobby are beautiful but the room was dated and lacking. Part of my discomfort was the lack of heat on a admittedly very cold night. The engineer improved the situation immediately, but the fact the heat wasn't working reinforced my feeling that the rooms are in need of an update. Nothing horribly wrong, but probably other more modern places to stay in the area. The staff is very friendly and competent.< /review>< Pictures>

Sorry to say it, I stayed in most of the SPG properties in the San Francisco area with most comfortable sleep, unfortunately at Palace I lost my sleep due to auto shutoff of Air Conditioners, I'm sure other customers might have similar experience. The problem is in the location of censors on Doors in an L shaped room, where movements on Bed are not recognized by censors on the door. I have to get up in the middle of sleep and wave my hands towards the doors for Air Conditioner to work again.

I raised this as a concern was given a different room but it is still same kind of room. I didn't expected this from a great hotel like this, the other issue I faced was Television Power line was unplugged.

Please relook at the location of censors on the property, the least a business person on travel expects a good night sleep after hectic travel and work.</text>

Upon check in, I had to push the receptionist to recognize my platinum benefits and give me the complimentary breakfast. What a mistake it was to get the breakfast benefit -- the staff treated me like I was a huge bother and did not refill our drinks once. 

Beyond that, the rooms are not designed for any sort of business travel as there is no in room coffee maker. 

Really disappointed as this is a nice property. Outside of the very few gems, the staff is bad.</review>

I come back here every time I'm in the city. Love the location of the hotel. You can easily access everything from hotel. If you take Bart in, hotel is right outside as you step of the escalator. Can't beat that. The staff is very friendly. Ruben at the front desk is impeccably professional and kind. Room is always clean. This hotel really recognizes SPG status and loyalty. I go to SF often and have stayed at other places in the past. The Palace will be my hotel of choice from now on!<//Text>

Decent hotel with historic feel if that is what you are looking for.  With historic you get small as in rooms.  Not sure this one is worth the money.</text>

I stayed in a executive suite for one night. Everything was great during the stay, but following day that I checked out, I received a revised invoice addaing $83 for minibar that I did never consume. Their feedback was fast during the stay, but not after check-out. This matter is still not resolved.< /review>

My favorite hotel. After work I will stop by to read in the main lobby have a light snack. Some of the best hotel employees in San Francisco work at this hotel.<//Text>

Check in took a long time as systems were not responsive. Reception desk had to go to three different computer systems before check in could be accomplished. Not a big deal on its own but when all of the other problems followed next, then it was just one of a number.
Next morning I ordered coffee and a banana. For $13, I got coffee, no banana. They brought it later but I had to go. I left the room to return in the afternoon to a less than presentable "refreshed room". The iron and ironing board was still out in the room with a room robe wadded up on it, trash not emptied, dirty napkins left on the desk where coffee was and refuse on the bedside table. No toilet tissue replenished. Basically, the bed had been made and the coffee dishes were removed but that is all. Overall, for the price paid, the experience was less than stellar, and I do not think I could recommend this hotel. After providing this info on a comment card upon check out, I am stunned that there has been no attempt to connect with me about it by a member of hotel management. Rarely do I take the time to comment but this time it was necessary.< /Text>

This is a great location, right next to Local edition, a very popular speakeasy in san Francisco. Montgomery Bart station is right across the street. This is the heart of SF!< /Review>

I travel a great deal with my work. Unfortunately from my check in, through my departure, I felt as if I was a bother to the staff, rather than a guest. As an example, my check-in took 3 times as long as another staff member. (Perhaps the gentleman was new -- but I stood by and watched 3 other guests move through the process while I waited for him to check me in.) When asking for a late check out, I was brushed aside by the staff member at the front desk. I have stayed in other Starwood hotels and have enjoyed the experience. This one -- not so much.</Review>

<Review>As an SPG member, I opted to use my Suite Night Awards to request a suite for my stay. I received an email from SPG prior to my stay advising that they would not be able to accommodate my request - ok, no big deal. Except a day later I get an email from the Palace Hotel advising that I can pay to uprgade to a suite. Hmm...so they are available...you just want more money? Got it. Needless to say I found that to be a little sneaky on their part, and a well run organization should not need to pull stunts like that just to make a few extra bucks.

When we arrived, I immediately thought the hotel was breathtaking. The garden eating area was absolutely stunning and we enjoyed a great meal there. Then...we got up to our room. Now coming from a tiny apartment in NYC, my expectations for hotel rooms are not that high - I just want them to be nicer than my apartment...not a difficult task. The room was an outdated closet. The bathroom looked like it had not been updated since the hotel opened, the bedroom was so tiny it could really only fit a bed and two side tables - why they decided to shove a chair and footrest in there is beyond me. Overall, just - ugh. My husband and I were both very disappointed.

On the bright side - we only stayed for 2 nights, then were off to another Starwood hotel that exceeded our expectations! :)<//Review><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmapID>< Rate>

<Text>I am a repeat visitor of the property for business purposes. Always a good experience but wanted to share a couple of comments. Stayed in room 455 this visit and the queen matress really needs to be flipped. It sagged a lot on the right side and was uncomfortable. Also the phone extension in the bathroom didn't work and I couldn't pick up an incoming call.

Frances went above and beyond to ensure the best possible stay. Words cannot express how amazing she is. In over 140 nights this year at SPG properties, this was by far the best SPG experience I have had.<//Review>

Stay or visit for the beautiful, glass roofed lobby, which will take you back in time. Nice, large high-end Starwood property with small but beautiful rooms. Great location for business or sight seeing/shopping. Front desk folks are extra nice to kids (they give out Ghirardelli chocolates). There's also an indoor swimming pool! #kidfriendly #bestofsf #letsguide< /review>

<Review>The Palace Hotel is an historic icon in Downtown San Francisco. Conveniently located on Market and near public transit, it’s easy to get to and a great location from which to explore the city.

The Garden Court in parricular is a beautiful venue in which to read or meet for a drink.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Beautiful Hotel! Beds were awesome! However, on the 4th floor next to the spa and pool there was a lot of noise and slamming of doors althroughout the day and night. Food was very tasty but I believe that $38 for breakfast buffet was a bit much.<//Review></record>

<Text>I am not sure what has happened to this hotel over he years. The lower level staff, maids, bellman, parking attendants are all very good, nice and polite, but the senior staff, front desk etc. seem to constantly be smirking; like they are in on an inside joke; it's funny to charge $60 a day to park, or sending a guest to a room that is not made up yet, knowing the gym is a joke, or making just plain useless concierge recommendations. For the money there are several really nice hotels in SF and this is no longer one of them.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I had looked up tripadvisor reviews and was surprised at the ranking the palace had. After staying there this weekend I can see why it is ranked so low for a 4 star luxury property that recently has been upgraded to category 6. First off, spg has recently decided to offer Internet for free to spg members who book directly. I had done that so I called to ask about how to go about receiving this. The guest services operator had no idea about this and stated it was only for certain spg levels. She forwarded me to the front desk, no response. Asked for them to call me back, no calls. Decided to reach out to social media team but the reception was so poor I couldn't use my phone. Eventually finally was verified by the Twitter team that I was correct. Tried again asking about internet but nothing. Finally spoke to Casey(or kc) and he ackowledged I was correct and that I could go ahead and state I was going to pay for Internet access when prompted and he would note my account to remove the charges. Next morning I receive an email from terry apologizing and offering free Internet as a courtesy gesture. Well Casey already did that so I wrote back, which I never received a reply. Being ignored is not fun.

Oh one more thing, Door view finder was blocked, stuffed with tissue paper! Who does that? Tweeted a picture to palace, of course they didn't reply until the day after check out.</Text>

<review>I'm disappointed.  A establishment such as this,I should be blasting how amazing my experience was.  This is NOT the case.  The bellman  Norman was the ONLY redeemable quality of the Palace Hotel. A parting idea, NEVER judge a book by its cover.  My money spends just as well as anyone else's.< /review><date>1506808656899< /date><user_name>Anxiety Girl (macanac)<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Our stay at the Palace went beyond our expectations. We received your wonderful welcome and kindness especially from the front desk when we arrived. Our room was beyond our expectations with perfect sleep. Our Son's birthday celebration and your Champagne Brunch as always, is our favorite place for a special time like this.<//Text>

We were so disappointed the Sunday Brunch as we knew it was no longer available. We make an annual trip with friends from Michigan each year to The Palace just to have brunch. What you offer now is the same as everyone else offers and was nothing special. I guess we will not be back next year. Very sad!!!!< /text>

<Text>We love the Garden Court restaurant and during our frequent stays in SF it is one of our favorite place to have business breakfast. Based on this, we decided to book our hotel room at the Palace Hotel for 2 nights during the 2013 holidays season. Actually we have been disappointed because we were expecting much more about the comfort. This hotel is very noisy, not cosy at all, and security control is pretty nonexistent. We arrived very late (1:30 am) but got waked up at 7:00 am when young kids started to run and scream in the hallways. We thought we had to take advantage of this early wake up to get breakfast at our favorite place. Second deception: the Garden Court turned down our demand for a table of 2 because he told us there was no table available (2/3 of the restaurant was empty!), so we had to get to an hotel manager to finally have our breakfast. Thanks to her.
I think we will go back to our usual plan for next time: having a room in another hotel much more comfortable where we have a better status, and come at the Garden Court restaurant only for breakfast or brunch.</Text>< pictures>

Not sure what's thinner the walls(when I hear my neighbor shower, break wind, flush the toilet, sneeze) or the window pane from 1875 that allows me to hear every conversation from passersbys) but my sanctuary from all that is the water closet....

When I am able to fit myself in the the water closet(it takes time and skill honed over 3 blissful nights in the sarcophagus of what is considered a room here at the palace) I find my happy place, free from the nuisance of technology, space(although I can shower and sit on the commode at the same time) car horns, heels from the damsels below ,steam whistles, burbling furnaces, historic copper pipes playing the songs of Harpies, Lament's of the homeless gentleman with the whole foods shopping cart and niners jersey below, those are from which I draw my inspiration after countless sleepless nights to write this fable of my incarnation.... I mean visitation to  this grand old Dame of what masquerades as a luxury collection hotel.......<//Review>

<review>Should not be billed as "luxury". Rooms were unclean, smelled musty like a lot of "historic" hotels do. Bathroom missing more spacious "curved" rod, tile and granite moldy. Friendly staff, great location and great history to hotel. A true SF landmark. Rooms just need to be more current.</review>< user_id>

Had a wonderful stay at the Palace and it was centrally located to what we wanted to do. We were able to walk to China Town, the Emabrcadero and Union Square .There is public transportation right outside the door for Fisherman's Wharf as well as other areas served by BART. The doorman was attentive to our needs for quick transportation whenever we needed a cab and he even arranged for a limo on New Year's Eve to take us to our restaurant.. The concierge was helpful in directions to places to eat and for getting around the city. My only problem was with the front desk/housekeeping. Granted it was New Years Eve afternoon and I know the staff was busy getting ready for the hotel's big New Years Eve party but it took over 6 hours and several calls to get extra glasses delivered and to replace the wet bathrobe that had been on the floor since early in the morning when we left the hotel for the day's activities. I called the front desk at 5:15 to request extra glasses since we were expecting another registered couple to our room later that night for drinks as well as a replacement for the bathrobe that housekeeping forgot in the morning when our room was cleaned up. We called again when we retuned to the room at 11:00 pm since these items had still not been delivered. The front desk was apologetic and we had our glasses and bathrobe delivered with a smile and an apology within 30 minutes. I would definitely stay here again!</review>

We had a medical emergency when we arrived at the hotel. About 12:00 pm We were told that it would be impossible to check in by the desk clerk. Our bellman could see that my partner was in a lot of pain- He went to the Manager on Duty to see if anything could be done and within 15 minutes Teresa (MOD) came to our rescue. A room was found -That is wonderful sincere service. We were very grateful!. I did not understand room service not being able to take a dinner order at 5:30 pm (the Service brochure states from 6am) If that is their policy- I hope they change it<//text>

<rating>None<//rating><review>There is no more beautiful restaurant than the Garden Court. We kept returning to it just to see how it looked at different times of day. The room which overlooked Market Street was amazingly quiet. The bed was comfy with an awesome comforter. For my partner,the very best thing though was the bathrobe. Now I may have to buy her one.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This is a truly elegant place to rest. The rooms are elegant and old-fashioned. The location is wonderful and the public areas scream luxury. I had a fun time staying here.<//review>

<review>This was our first stay, and will be our last. For the class of hotel The Palace is, it falls short. The room was fine, and the bed comfortable, but the carpet was old and stained, and they couldn't get the WiFi signal strength to a decent level. The front desk staff, however, was very responsive and friendly.The breakfast in The Garden Court is expensive and generally poor quality, although the fruit was good and the crab omelette was well prepared. The service in The Garden,however, is slow and poor quality. We travel a lot, and we rated The Palace on a level with some of the mid-range, or lower, hotels or motels one might stay in.</review>< user_name>

This hotel is dirty, no room service, dinner is a choice of salad or hamburger (that's it!), they are not concerned with the picket line and what that means to their guests at all, and the smell at the 6th floor elevator bank smells of a landfill.  Not a single good thing to say about this hotel.  Very disappointing.<//text>

I have been loyal to SPG for years and have the AMEX card associated with it. Every time I use my SPG free points to get a room, they give me the worst room possible. Why is it that they treat their truly loyal customers the worst. The room I had at the Palace faced the interior court which looked like a prison, and the room I had in Petaluma at the Sheraton faced the interior courtyard which was horrible. I think I need to choose another hotel company to be loyal to.< /Text>

< Review>
This was not my first preference but I was in town for a conference and this was the organization's hotel of choice. The hotel is certainly gorgeous and the facility has great meeting rooms. While the stay overall was satisfactory, there were several issues I feel compelled to share. There is a fee for Internet service. Granted, there are still hotels that charge for this. However, it was impossible to access most of the time and I ended up using most of my data plan on my cel phone for Internet. I did speak to technical support on 6 different occasions during my stay in an attempt to get it to work consistently. Finally gave up.

Towards the end of my 6 night stay, I awoke in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, only to discover that housekeeping had not left a replacement roll of bathroom tissue when they cleaned the room. Another major inconvenience at 3am.

Once I arrived home, I realized that the folio I was given only covered 1 night of my stay. Now dealing with trying to get a copy of it from the Accounting department. Left them a message and hoping to hear back.

None of these inconveniences are that big a deal, but together they detract greatly from what might have been a great experience.</Review>

For the costs charged, and given there was a strike with no services offered, this was not a good experience.
the noise and lack of service made this an unenjoyable stay in what is supposed to be a luxury experience. Very disappointing.<//text>

I was really impressed with the serivce, however I must say that I was dissappointed with my room. I am an American Express Platinum card holder which entitles me to Gold Preferred Guest status and the front desk extended late check-out and free wi-fi, but the room was tired and faced the courtyard. As a Gold member I should have received a room upgrade; the week before the rooms were half price if you pre-paid but I decided to pay the rack rate - but the room was probably the same as those who paid half price< /review>

The room was too small for two queen beds and not at all luxurious. I paid a premium price for the single night. Finding out that we had to pay for wifi in the room was disappointing. In the middle of the night, something fell off the shelf in the closet waking all of us including my 2 year old granddaughter. The rest of the night was spent tossing and turning trying to get back to sleep. I chose this hotel because I wanted to treat my son and his family to a beautiful night's stay in a beautifully appointed hotel. That turned out not to be the case. Sadly, I would not recommend this hotel again.< /review>

< review>
I booked a room at the Palace Hotel for a very special weekend. I had planned a surprise engagement for my girlfriend and flew her parents into San Francisco to take part in the surprise. While I had other less expensive options in San Francisco, I chose the Palace Hotel because it is a part of Starwood’s Luxury Collection and I wanted to treat my future in-laws to something special. Unfortunately, Palace Hotel experience was everything but special.

Being a Starwood Gold Member, I requested an early check-in. This request was not only denied but my future mother-in-law was not even able to check in at the guaranteed 3PM check in time and had to change in the bathroom to prepare for the evening’s festivities. When she returned to the hotel in high spirits after a wonderful evening, she was disappointed with complexity of checking in at 11PM. Not only that, but the staff was unable to retrieve her checked in luggage so she had to walk into the luggage closet to find and pick up her luggage herself. This is a very frustrating experience to top off a long day and evening.

The next morning, the request for late check out was again denied even after explaining the situation from the previous night. To make matters worse, the staff was reluctant to check their luggage back in as they claimed to be too “busy” at the time.

This is NOT the experience I would expect from a Starwood hotel, not to mention any hotel that charges $400-$500 a night.

Disappointed by this entire experience, I left the management at Palace a message the following week only to be met with silence for over a week. Only after placing a formal complaint with Startwood customer service, did I receive a generic email from The Palace front desk manager acknowledging the complaint. No apology was made and no offers to make things right other than sentence stating that my next stay with them will be “flawless”.

It’s hard to believe that Starwood would even let hotels with such bad service carry their name. To say the least, I extremely disappointed and am rethinking my loyalty to Starwood as a whole.<//review>

与我一块入住的三家游伴对旧金山皇宫酒店地段以及它的建筑风格很赞叹。酒店于 1875 年建造，堪称百年历史性酒店，是旧金山最珍贵的标志性建筑之一。 酒店距离联合广场、唐人街等步行十分钟左右，外出购物非常方便。

酒店花园餐厅很气派，天鹏拱顶建筑，非常典雅，每天早上在这里用餐是一种享受。

酒店房间偏小，卫生间卫浴设施较老化，但酒店没有花力气改造。

酒店内的吹笛酒吧Pied Piper 很有名，号称被评选为“世界七大酒吧”之一，晚上客人很多，早点去还可以欣赏乐队表演。<//text>

Nice hotel, but not quite as great as I hoped. Room had a very mediocre view. Our door wouldn't stay locked and we had to get maintenance to fix. Hotel staff 'misplaced' our breakfast order. Elevator struggles going up if you don't start at ground level.</text>

<Review>If you are looking for absolute luxury when staying in San Francisco, The Palace is the place. From the extraordinary flower arrangement in the lobby to the Palm Court, and the best pillows ever. Staff is incredibly nice without being overbearing.< /Review></record>

I do not consider myself a "travel warrior" but have traveled a fair amount or both business and pleasure. For me the "value" of the accommodation just was not there. Maybe $650.night is considered a "deal" in SF but never-the-less there is an expectation when you are being charged this much. The marked and gouged furniture, tattered lampshades, non-operating light, cracked bathroom basin and un cleaned vanity top were definitely not what I expected. (happy to provide pictures if you want) And finally there was the compete ambivalence to my unfavourable comments offered at check out.< /review>

Our stay at the palace is now one of the wonderful memories of our relationship!
We look forward to many more memories shared at the Palace.
I just wish they had a way to group all the families with small children together, it appeared as if a child care center opened at 7 a.m. Sunday morning next to us.</review>

Extremely rude front desk, as an SPG gold member and for my bday had a terrble experience and I am horribly disappointed. I emailed afterwards and no answer.
This hotel has lots to learn from SPG guest service.

please contact me ASAP.

< Review>
The location of this hotel is fabulous and staff by and large nice and helpful. However, room windows screwed shut and could not be opened--horrible; we requested a room with working windows and were told none available. Lampshades dirty, dented, cockeyed. No free wi fi? Room service overpriced and food not very good--$4.50 for a glass of iced tea plus $5 delivery +20%!!!!!!<//Review>

<Rate>None</Rate><Text>This is supposed to be a four star "luxury" hotel. Check in took a while. The "SPG" line had a clerk who was on the phone and not checking in guests. The other clerk had a guest who was checked in but was being chatty. The clerk saw us in line, but made no effort to end the conversation with the other guest. So, we waited. The room was a gorgeous junior suite. The bathroom faucet was dripping. We had co-workers over that night for cheese and wine, so we ordered wine glasses up to the room. The next morning, we found out the bathtub wasn't draining very well, so we were ankle deep in soapy water during our showers. Upon leaving for our business meeting, I told the front desk of the dripping faucet, the slow draining tub and could we please have more towels. Upon arriving back at the room later that afternoon, the sink was still dripping and there was a stack of towels on the sofa. The dirty wine glasses were still on the coffee table and the dirty hand towels in the bathroom hadn't been replaced or even straightened. The next morning, we noticed that the tub was draining nicely. Upon checkout, we told the clerk about our experience. "We are so sorry" was said, but that was it.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We reserved a room with two beds. The terms of that reservation were carefully specified in the original reservation and then reconfirmed by phone. Upon arrival, a front desk staffer suggested that we take a king bed with two rollaways. Upon seeing the room, it was a ridiculous suggestion. We literally had to walk across beds to move from one part of the room to another. It turned out that the front desk staffer urged us to take that type of room because the type we had reserved was already fully subscribed. In other words, the hotel did not in practice hold the specified type of room for us, then tried to pass off an unsuitable room as better. The hotel then discounted the room and offered to switch us to a two-bed room for the balance of the stay. However, the hotel was not able to effect that switch until 5 pm the following day, leading to another full day of inconvenience. The Palace in SF did not fulfill the terms of the reservation, did not deal with us transparently, and delivered less than what was reserved. Reservations at the hotel are not to be taken at face value. Confirm what you have specified in your reservation in advance, get the details of who confirms it, and hold the front desk staff to the terms of the reservation. I have had a much better experience at other, nominally lesser Starwood properties than what I received at the Palace. I would not recommend it.</Text>

2. And I also did not received any benefit from my Golden membership.< /review>

The Palace has long been one of my favorite hotels in San Francisco. It's storied past, exquisite public spaces, the Pied Piper Bar are all traditions not to be missed. But a recent visit showed that the luster has faded. The carpets in the hallways and rooms are in need of replacement. The walls in the common areas and rooms were marked up and the staff seemed less than entusiastic. I have stayed here many times before, but I must admit I probably will not return unless there are some iimprovements made. Room service trays sat for hours in the hallways, the gym was unattended and the lockers were not available for use, and the staff at the Front Desk was abrupt at check in.< /review>

This hotel does a great job offering the beauty of period decor but keeping facilities modern and well maintained. I have seen great SPG platinum upgrades. Beds are not quite as good as other SPG chains for some reason.<//Text>

Wifi was awful .. and expensive Told concierge but nothing was improvedYou would think in San Francisco, even a 5* hotel could manage fast internet. Instead, could not join Skype meetings , because the sound was choppy and web pages took ages to load .. Also, hotel charges 18.00 every time you make a call, even if that call was not successful in connecting .. nearly 100usd for trying to call someone .. that is not reasonable charging<//review>

<Text>This is a gorgeous hotel in a terrific location. The rooms are small, which is to be expected for a room in the city. The bathroom appeared to be recently redone and was very nice.

Unfortunately, the bed was terribly uncomfortable. My husband and I couldn't wait to get home to our own mattress and pillows, a feeling we have never encountered at hotels in the past. We were also a bit surprised by the parking fee, which was more expensive than any fee I've ever encountered, even compared to New York City.<//Text><date>1338336000000<//date><resp>None</resp>< name>

Ordinarily the luxury Sheraton hotels are exceptional. However, due to employees on active strike, the experience was rather distracting and many of the services underwhelming or unavailable.< /Text>

<review>Although the property is beautiful and the staff is generally friendly, we suffered service lapses -- sometimes major -- every day of our stay. These included room service that took a full hour to deliver a pot of coffee, a long wait at check-in, front door and valet service in a constant state of disarray, the Garden Court being closed without prior notice, and the lack of a dresser in our room. Overall, the experience was far below what we've come to expect from Luxury Collection properties.< /review>< pictures>

4 day stay was very enjoyable
late check out was much appreciated
hotel in excellent location. We took BART from SFO right to the hotel
Only complaint was the very high cost of the breakfast in the Garden Room - a lower priced fare would get many more customers
The bar was old style with a wonderful comfortable feel< /Review>

I have stayed at this hotel many times, and in general it's a lovely place, right in the heart of downtown San Francisco. This time I booked on points. Since I will be a Lifetime Platinum this year, I know what to expect for service at a Luxury Collection Starwood Hotel. That's not what I got on this trip. I got to the front desk around 2:15 pm, but the room wasn't ready yet, which was fine. After confirmation of my phone number the desk clerk said he'd phone me when the room was ready. At 5 pm I still had not received a call, and was due at a dinner engagement at 6, so I went back to the hotel to find out what was going on. The desk clerk told me that they only call if the room becomes available before the standard 3 pm check in time. Supposedly the room became available at the standard check in time, so no one bothered to call. This put me in a bind for meeting my dinner engagement. The clerk got me into the room quickly, but then the luggage valet brought someone else's luggage and had to go back to get mine. The clerk also sent a note with chocolate and wine as an apology, which I appreciated. Upon return from dinner I discovered that there was no remote control in my room for the TV. I called, and half an hour later, still no remote. Called AGAIN, and finally it showed up, more than 45 minutes after my initial call. The room needed maintenance - the overhead light in the bath flickered constantly, and the shower drain was so slow that I was up to my ankles in water by the end of the shower. The next day I asked the front desk for a shopping bag, and was told the hotel did not offer them. I happen to know this is untrue, since they are usually in the closet. The clerk called housekeeping and learned they were available. I was told one would be sent to my room right away. I delayed leaving the hotel for the day to wait for it but, 45 minutes later, still no shopping bag, so I left. The shopping bag was there upon my return 4 hours later.
Also, be aware that the Platinum complimentary breakfast is for CONTINENTAL only. I put a spoonful of eggs on my plate and got charged $7.00 for that.
This is a beautiful property and a Luxury level hotel in the Starwood group should be doing much better than this on the small details. All this wouldn't prevent me from coming back, but it sure doesn't help the hotel stand out.</Review>

I was extremely disappointed in this hotel. The walls between rooms are paper thin. You can hear everything that is going on in the rooms next to you. And it's not your neighbors being loud, it's just them talking in a normal voice.

I talked to the front desk staff about moving my room after the first night of this, but according to the person I spoke with all the rooms are the same when it comes to that. Seems like they hear that issue a lot. It's just really weird, they do a great job of keeping out the street noise. But they can't put insulation between the rooms.

They also need to do something about the constant slamming of doors. Seriously this is a luxury brand hotel. How about some luxury then.

The bed was great. Bathroom was tiny. No space to put our toiletries. Great location. Great breakfast.</review>

The front desk, both checking in and checking out, has a lot to be desired. Each time they took another call as they were waiting on me. My bill was emailed to me 4 days late and only after I asked. Finally, the bill was wrong.

Great facility but service is lacking< /Review>

<text>This place is very nice and well kept for such an old building. The reason for the 2 stars is they charged me $18.99 for a movie I never watched. I couldn't even turn on the tv due to a non functional remote. To top it off, I filed a discrepancy on the bill and after 8 calls, 5 emails, and 3 trouble tickets, I have not received a call back. I keep calling and continually get transferred to the accounting manager. Terrible guest services. Also, yes, I am a Starwood Preferred guest too, I have never received such terrible customer service. In my mind, an establishment is characterized by how they respond to issues, not how they present up front.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
We stayed for 2 nights at the end of December. Staying here is a treat to appreciate the history of the hotel and the city. In addition to the ornate details and beautiful building it was nice to see the hotel decorated and lighted for the Christmas holidays.

As others have said the bathrooms are a bit on the small side but they are nonetheless nicely appointed. I did not miss not having a coffee maker in the room and had no problem going down to the beautiful lobby in the morning to get my coffee fix (I’m sure the quality of the coffee from the lobby is far superior to anything you would get from an in-room coffee maker anyway.) Since the price of breakfast for two of us would have probably cost around $50 we opted to eat breakfast at a bakery/coffee shop around the corner on Market Street.

When we checked in I asked for a room away from the elevators only to be assigned to room 660 directly next to the elevator! We tried the room for about an hour but could hear the elevators running in the room plus we got a lot of noise from other guests talking loudly while waiting for the elevators. After an hour I decided this would not be a satisfactory room for our stay. After twice trying to call the front desk to enquire about moving to a different room and no one picking up, I walked down to the front desk. The desk was not busy so I’m not sure why they never picked up the phone when I called. I explained our room dissatisfaction to the same clerk that checked us in and she was able to find us a room on the 8th floor away from the elevators.

The high ceilings in the rooms make them feel spacious and the beds are very comfortable. Between the two rooms we used, one had a large closet and the other had a wardrobe. The view from our room was across to another part of the hotel and looking up you could see the top of the hotel sign on the roof facing Market Street. Since we were in an interior room we did not have any street noise. But the walls are rather thin so we could hear people talking and the TV from the room next to ours.

On our second night we had some drinks and dessert in the Pied Piper Bar. It was amazing to have drinks in a room with a $2 million dollar painting but the service was a bit slow.

Overall we think it’s a beautiful hotel and we would probably stay there again even with some of the minor complaints I’ve listed above. (If you’re at the hotel on a Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday you can take a 90 minute historic tour of the hotel that departs from close to the concierge desk.)

TIP: Due to the beautiful open stairways and open area by the elevators, the acoustics tend to amplify the voices of people waiting for elevators; if this would be bothersome to you, ask for a room away from the elevators</Review>

-key set not working , had to get back and was asked again to wait in line
- asked specifically for quiet room, was very noisy 
- worst valet service ever, average breakfast<//review>

The room was not ready when we checked in around 2pm. We were told the cleaning would be expedited and we would be called on cell phone. 45 minutes later we went back to the front desk as no one called us. We discovered that the cleaning was not expedited and the front desk staff has no clue when the room would be ready. Complete lack of accountability. Then we talked to the assistant manager who called housekeeping to ready the room. The entire process was extremely poor. We had three children with us and the check-in staff showed no empathy.<//review>

I have not stayed here to give a full fledged review but did have a company party here and the place looks awesome with beautifully decorated ceilings and well maintained walls and floors. The service they gave for the party was nice and I would come back to visit the hotel to check it out even more in detail.<//Review>

<Text>We enjoyed our short stay and hope to return some day. The only distress that occurred while we were there was that the shower head came off while one of us was in the shower. There were no injuries, but it was hard to screw back on. The staff, especially Ediar, was outstanding and extremely helpful.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
The two stars for this place only come from the beauty of the architecture in the main lobby.

When we arrived, the only (and very rude) concierge was assisting other guests at the time. Did not mind the wait, but was curious as to why one of the many other employees milling about the lobby could not also be assisting guests at the front desk.

There seemed to be a misunderstanding about pricing that the other guests were concerned about. They were repeatedly talked down to as the concierge ("Shan", on his name plate) insisted he was right about the price, bringing out a calculator, and loudly discussing the matter in front of us and another party waiting in line.

After those guests were finished with their transaction, we approached the same frazzled concierge. He apologized for the wait, unnecessarily adding, "So frustrating..." in regard to what had just transpired with the previous guests. He then hurriedly checked us in without many pleasantries, and did not inform us about any amenities for our use beyond the time the pool and fitness area closed.

The next day, as we did not have time to enjoy the pool but wanted to see it, we asked two managers in the lobby what floor we could find the pool on. One manager was uncertain and consulted another. They both agreed it was on floor 3 and to take a left from the elevators. It was on floor four, we found out, after trying to navigate the third to no avail. Frustrating that the managers of a hotel as beautiful as this would not know this information.

Our room was very nice albeit smaller than imagined. However, the stunning view of a courtyard that looks out only onto a rooftop and other rooms all facing inward on each other, was enough to keep the curtains drawn and leave unimpressed.

Would not recommend to friends.< /Review>

<rating>None< /rating><review>After departing and not getting my folio emailed to me - I needed to reach the front desk and the phone just rings and rings and rings. Seriously, I waited for 3minutes until it simply hung up on me. Tried it two more times. Almost 10minutes and zero answer.
Ridiculous.
However I should have expected this "service" seeing that while staying in their extremely small room, I needed to ask a couple questions to the front desk and it was next to impossible to get any help. Guess they either need to retrain their staff or add more.

The ONLY thing going for this location is the ease of it being in the heart of Union Square. I was expecting so much more with the grandeur of the name...

Oh and make sure you know PARKING is WAY overpriced! It costs almost $50 per night! And the only other real option would be to self park for maybe a couple dollars less... so they know they can charge this ridiculous rate and get away with it.

No - I do NOT think I would want to stay here again. There is no club lounge or real amenities for platinum status and with the rooms being SO small I would rather take my business elsewhere.

On a positive note - the bathrooms although they are tiny, the shower was super relaxing with great water pressure.</review>< pictures>

<Review>The Palace Hotel is a good luxury hotel with a great location in the heart of San Francisco.

The Hotel: The Palace hotel is a beautiful hotel with a wonderful sitting/brunch area. Wonderful stained glass windows and beautiful pillars adorn the lobby making this hotel feel like a luxury hotel. The pool and workout facilities are great but can be very loud if children are present, I wouldn't say that this is a relaxing hotel but more of a good hotel to explore SF from. The rooms have very high ceilings and were spacious and reflect what I would expect from a 4-star hotel. Our window view was facing toward the inside so we had a view of all the other inside windows, but this meant that we had no street noise and our room was very quiet. The walls are not 100% sound proof and I was woken up one night by, what I am assuming to be, a bachelorette party which was creating a considerable amount of noise screaming and yelling at 2am. Thankfully they left, but I wouldn't expect complete sonic isolation in your hotel room.  Hotel staff were helpful and the concierge was phenomenally good and I would highly recommend Debbie.

The Location: This hotel is located on prime real estate and is within walking distance (15 min walk) of the Embarcadero. My family and I had no trouble getting an Uber to take us to Fisherman's Wharf in under 10 mins. It is also on Market street, which is a large public transportation hub, is very close to union square (where all the tour buses pick up), and is very close to the SF Museum of Modern Art! My only gripe with the location is lack of parking, we paid over $35/day to park our rental car in a hidden parking garage, and there is a very large homeless population that is around the hotel. The hotel staff do a great job of keeping the homeless population out of the hotel and off the property, but as soon as you walk anywhere else away from the hotel there are a significant number of homeless people. I felt somewhat safe walking back to the hotel at night but I would recommend taking an Uber/Taxi straight to the hotel entrance instead.

Overall this hotel is definitely what I have come to expect from a city based 4-Star hotel and I was satisfied with my experience. Good location and good rooms provided an overall good experience.<//Review>< pics>

夜中に車で着いた時にポーターさんが荷物を全然取りに来て頂けなかったのは、残念でした。
あと、スタンダードな部屋なので、窓が小さく内装もそんなに満足できませんでした。
ただ、今回は、９時間ぐらいしかホテルに居なかったので、よくは、分かりませんが、
まぁ、普通のホテルと言う感想です。< /text>

<text>Though my visit was brief (...really to connect with friends who were staying at the hotel), the Palace is a quiet haven in the heart of Financial District on Market. Rooms are quaint but updated. Its location is Central to everything (Montgomery BART, Union Square, Yuerba Beuna, et al). But what sets this landmark apart is its legendary glass atrium, the Garden Court, which easily lends itself for a memorable meal or high tea.< /text>< pics>

Due to the location and well-known reputation, we've chosen Palace for the stay in San Francisco. With some reason on schedule & flight change, we've cancelled 1 night of our stay in San Francisco and no refund is requested as of we fully understand the policy before booking. We've made request for such change 4 days ago, but with re-confirmation, it's provided wrong information to my guest. Simply, we only ensure no confusion to made in between the frontdesk and our executive, but the staff from both frontdesk called "Sarah"and "reservation department" are rude, even shout in conversation, warn with threatening to end call or border my guest, (but I am the customer who made this booking", even we just would like to clarify with them in mild and we're calling from overseas). We hardly believe the customer service is holly bad and horrible in US, with extremely contrast of our expectation. We will never make accommodation again and suggest you to make other choice in avoidance to encounter unpleasant and horrible memory in tour.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The Palace is a San Francisco Classic with a historically high reputation. It's designation as a Starwood, Luxuary Collection Property adds to one's expectations. While many of the property's features meet these high expectations, sadly the property is more than a little worn around the edges.
The Garden Room is beautiful, but service there is lacking, inconsistant, limited, and over priced for what it is now.
The front lobby is almost non-existent, though staff were friendly and professional. A grand hotel needs a lobby.
Low spot was guest room. Bedrooms were in desperate need of renovation; dirty worn carpet and upholstery, broken unfinished furniture and inaccessible electrical outlets. On the positive side; comfortable bed and good shower! saved the day. Walls are paper thin, lots of noise between rooms and the hallway. Loud drunk young people had to be removed from hallway at 3 am. Please renovate these rooms, or don't rent them as Starwood luxury collection!
Maxwell's Pied Piper Bar and Grill is a high point. It does exude classic San Francisco, comfortable, warm and friendly, ..….but even here service was slow, and bar food menu limited.
The Palace remains a classic San Francisco landmark, and I hope that it receives the attention that it desperately needs.<//text>

This was our first and last time staying at The Palace.
Prior to our arrival I requested an earlier check in time, as a SPG member this request is usually granted. We arrived at 11:15AM, checked in and was told our room wasn't ready, understandable.
I was told someone will call when the room is ready. After shopping for about 3 hrs we head back to the hotel, only to be told the room is still not ready. Really? The front desk staff didn't even to offer to call housekeeping to find out when it would be ready, he just stated that Check in is at 3PM, it should be ready by then. Really? That's SPG Service? It's not and it is the reason why I will not go back to this hotel when visiting San Francisco.
Valet parking is super expensive and super slow, it took over 35 minutes to retrieve our car, we were told it would only take 15. Oh, one more thing, it was never acknowledged that I was a SPG member, and to top it off, they write down the room rate you paid on the back of the key holder, tackiest thing I've ever experienced at a hotel. I asked why they did that and the response was "it's our policy so people know how much they are paying for the room." HUH?

Spoke to a manager, she was very apologetic and understanding. She tried to do right, I accepted her offer. But learned a few things as to why the hotel is dysfunctional. Bottom line, it's San Francisco and there are many other properties to choose from. Enjoy the aesthetics, but stay somewhere else.<//text>

That said, the wifi is slow and unreliable. How can that be in a hotel that attracts business travelers, especially in the Bay Area?! With Silicon Valley just down the highway surely they can sort this out. My other complaint is inadequate fitness facilities.

<Text>The staff was very efficient and accommodating and the service provided was gracious.

The accommodations were luxurious and the hotel was in a prime location, close to everything. We loved the Ghirardelli cafe accessible from the hotel.</Text>< Pics>

Every employee is courteous, friendly, helpful, efficient and proud to serve. The room, although small, has everything needed. There is no street noise. It is a delight to sit in the hallways and lobby and enjoy this hotel.<//Review>

I stayed in this hotel for two nights for a conference. The building itself is splendid. The room was of a good size but not spacious. The bathroom was clean and functional but outdated. The food is good but nothing special.</Text>

When we left we called for help with our bags. It was 15 minutes before I called again to get no answer. I then took my family, 6 bags and stroller to the lobby where I found 2 people doing nothing behind the desk and a crew of 3 staff lounging by the door. At that point I wrote off this hotel. I don't care how good you look or how busy you are, when some asks for help, send it or say you can't don't make them wait. Then failing to answer the phone at 11 am?

As I left in an irritated manner I still tipped the doorman despite his suffering from self importance. He let me know that the tip was not adequate. This hotel suffers from an entitlement mentality.</text>

<review>With checkin listed as 3pm, I arrived at 2:50 and was told my room was not ready but I would be called on my mobile as soon as it was ready. After sitting in the lobby for over 2 hrs waiting for a call I re-approached the front desk. Reuben, who originally checked me in, lied and said he called my mobile and left a message. I then was issued a handicap room. Upon discovering that I requested a regular room. Reuben said he would send the bellman with keys immediately. After 10 minutes and no bellman I returned to the front desk to collect the new keys myself. Again Reuben lied that a bellman was waiting for me. I then asked to speak to a manager. Reuben said a manager would call me. Unsurprisingly, I never received any contact from anyone else. The delayed checkin made me late for my dinner meeting and soured my overall stay.< /review>< pics>

Water was dark brown even after running it for 30 minutes. Was informed that the City had turned the water off between 1:00 - 5:00 a.m. for maintenance. Contacted the manager who didn't offer that the hotel recognized the problem and was trying to rectify it nor did he offer that perhaps the shower in the fitness center or another room could be okay.

I stayed while on business. I was shocked that there was a charge for Wi-Fi. A top hotel should have amenities not included in more pedestrian hotels. In the future, I will ask about Wi-Fi. This is important enough for me to avoid the Palace until they change their amenities.</review>

<Review>The hotel is being renovated, but that is not disclosed in advance. The sheet in the guest room says that work will take place between 9 am and 4 pm, but it is now 8 am and there has been loud banging going on for about an hour, and a hotel of this caliber should not be waking guests up with hammers banging at 7 am. The pool is closed. The work out facility has been shifted to a much inferior and sparsely supported location. Because the exterior windows are being cleaned, the hotel affirmatively recommends keeping the drapes closed all day. Very disappointing. Recommend avoiding it until the renovations are concluded.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Ultimately, The Palace Hotel did not live up to our expectations. The common areas of the hotel are absolutely gorgeous and I would encourage anyone looking for a high end brunch to visit the hotel on a weekend for brunch. That said, the guest rooms were drab. They showed significant signs of aging with peeling paint and splintered doors and were very poorly decorated. Additionally, the walls in the hotel are paper thin. We were greeted each morning to the alarm of one of our neighbors (just a standard blackberry alarm) and we could hear the woman on the other side whenever she was on the phone. And even though we were at the end of the hall, not near the elevator, we heard noise from the hallways whenever people were coming or going to their rooms. I definitely would not stay at this hotel again.< /text>

The Palace Hotel is a good place to grab a drink after work. They have a bar and a lounge area with plenty of seating after work.</review>

Staying at the Palace Hotel is always a treat and this time was no exception. The location, ambiance and service always delight. The concierge desk was very helpful in arranging for a rental car in advance of my arrival.<//review>

Fine hotel for those on vacation but for the business traveler, there was no internet in the meeting rooms even though you paid for it. Extremely frustrating and you had to talk to an IT person that was on the east coast and couldn't help. Hair dryer did not work, no one answers the housekeeping line, front desk line or the conciere's desk. For the business traveler, I would try other alternatives.< /text>

The food is excellent, service impeccable, but ambience is destroyed by hotel guests who come down wearing bed-head, flannel pajama pants and flip flops.  One woman was wearing a t-shirt that left nothing whatsoever to the imagination.  Time and a place, people.  I wish the hotel management would do something.<//Review>

Went for the breakfast buffet.  Nice selection of food, however no cooked to order items. Beautiful setting.  At $40/ person (food, tax and tip) you are paying for the setting, not the food.</Text>

Worst place ever to stay. When checking in they took 800.00 for authorization for a night stay no one ever mentioned. The prices you pay tgey charge you 72.00 for valet and worse 35.00 to park in there garage. When going to my room they said it was luxury they need to look word up the room was a box small omg worst experience ever. And they knew it was my anniversary weekend.<//review>

The lobby is grand. The halls are wide. The rooms are elegant. The staff wants to serve their guests. The restaurant serves a fantastic brunch. The location is near Market Street and a short walk to Union Square.

The check in process is smooth and they clearly recognized our Platinum Status (i.e. we received a room upgrade).

If you want "BETTER", this is the place to stay!</text>< Pics>

This hotel has a great location in the financial district, colonial luxury , the only thing. There was an extension cord from another room to power some lights in my room that was looking kind of dangerous. I love the gym and pool, average price for a San Francisco hotel< /Text>

<Review>The hotel is very convenient to all financial district and Moscone events.

Until they change or fix Guest room internet providers, don't bother! Very slow. Disconnects frequently! They'll give you a refund, but why even go through the trouble. Just don't do it. Hopefully they'l get that fixed.<//Review>< pics>

The good: The classic elements of this hotel are fabulous. Detailed moldings, nice furniture, polished looking and professional staff.
The bad: Need to evolve and more into the digital age. My reason for not recommending is biased to the business traveller who is in need of fast broadband (it was painfully slow for high bandwidth needs like remote access) and a business center. Outlets were difficult to find in the room. Walls are thin.< /Text>

My husband and I had our wedding reception here 17 years ago and wanted to return for a romantic evening. The hotel itself is beautiful and quiet, in the lobby and main areas. However, we were awakened by the cries of a screaming toddler at 7 a.m. on a Sunday morning. After that the maids were banging on doors yelling, "Housekeeping!" even though ours had a "Do not disturb" sign. After that stopped, it sounded like someone was moving in at about 8:30 a.m. Turns out they were moving all of the beds out of the rooms. The thought of bed bugs and "The Shining" simultaneously crossed my mind. I wonder if we would have had better luck with noise if we just stayed in the lobby?<//text>

<review>This stay was to make good on the hotel falling short for our Wedding in January 2014. This was a offer to redo our stay for our honeymoon as the staff member for our wedding put us in a different room of lesser looks after sending us photos of a nicer suite saying we would be staying there.
Now I go in May to book the room for us that night of June 9-10. The woman does not send me to the manager that told me to book with him, finds out I am using a gift certificate and tells me its completely booked. NOT until I go online and explain I have in holding a reservation for our room we were supposed to have that she books it for us. ALREADY that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
We arrive. we get undressed and head to the pool to take a jacuzzi. Not a sign saying anything, yet the jacuzzi is empty. Ridiculous. So we decide on getting a facial in the spa.. only to wonder for 45 min until a guest explains there is no spa anymore... TAKE DOWN THE SIGN for a spa if you do not have a spa in the hotel.
We then sadly go back to our room and decide to use the jacuzzi. I call downstairs because there is powder all over the inside of the tub. Concerned I ask what it could be and she just says "it may be cleanser, just rinse it out and itll be fine." Am I a maid? Do I do that at my own home? NO. Lastly, the chandelier begins flickering the morning we are leaving and I call downstairs because I look closer and realize the Chandelier is missing a leg and has a LOOSE WIRE, FRAYED wire, just attached to the chandelier. THANK god I didn't touch the light. This is supposed to be the heart of San Francisco Hotel. I am disappointed that these rooms aren't checked religiously and Loose wires, unkept baths are disgusting.< /review>< Pics>

From the time we arrived we were treated like Royalty. The Bellmen were very helpful with directions. The beds were so comfortable and morning coffee was the best.<//text>

Absolutely, overwhelming décor that is historically perfect. Only wish that we had been given a map of the hotel. Did not know there was a pool until we left and saw children with their family in wet swimming clothes. Was there a gym or spa?< /Text>

<pics>None</pics><name>Aron Galonsky</name><Review>I really wanted to like the Palace Hotel.  I stayed there as part of a vacation in SF.  Note, I stay in SF probably 10-12 times a year on business, and average 20-30 stays in hotels a year.

In any event, as part of the Starwood Luxury collection, I was expecting, well, luxury.  Instead I was treated a bit rudely by the staff checking us in.  The room we had was smallish, and if it was renovated, not in many years.  We had arrived at the hotel around 10:30 am, early for a 3 pm check in. I didn't expect to get in then, but was hoping we could get a room by 1 pm or so, so that we could wash up to head out with friends.  Again, even with my Platinum status, I never felt entitled to a room before 3 pm, but was disappointed.  At 4 pm when I tried to check in, I was told my room was still not ready, and they didn't know when it would be.  That's when, I admit, I got frustrated.  In any event, after a conversation we received our downgraded room.

I'll spare the rest of the complaints, but suffice to say you're better off at the Westin St. Francis at a similar price point, a great restaurant in the hotel, and always friendly service.< /Review><date>1367715143206< /date><response>None</response><rating>2< /rating></record>

I booked a room well in advance with 2 beds since we had 2 kids and 2 adults. Upon arriving, we were told that the there were no rooms available with 2 beds and was given a room with king bed and a roll away bed. When asked what was the use of reserving a room, the front desk told me that they only guarantee the room but not the type of room or the beds in the room. The roll away bed could sleep only one person. I called the house keeping for another roll away bed but got a very rude answer that they were out of roll over beds. we could not sleep properly since it was very uncomfortable sleeping 3 people on a king bed. Highly disappointed with this 4 star hotel.<//text>

< review>
The hotel booked bus loads of college students for a football game the majority of which did not have hotel reservations but shared rooms. They PARTIED in the halls all night, were drunk and disorderly including a fistfight. There were numerous complaints from many guests but security was overwhelmed by the number of students. My room was moved to another floor which was also booked by students. I didn't sleep and we were frightened to leave the room at night. I was told I would receive 12000 pts for my inconvenience its been a year and I have not seen them in my account. The front desk attendant informed me that this happens frquently BEWARE< /review>

<review>Every stay at this property has been great. This time it fell apart with difficulties at check in. As a Amex Centurion card holder I was disappointed my early check in request could not be honored. We arrived at the property at 2 pm and were told the rooms will be ready soon and that they would call us. At 3:30 pm I had to insist that one of the 2 rooms should be ready. Very disappointing. Also the upgrades were not honored.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>We recently stayed at the Palace Hotel for a family vacation and were disappointed with the overall experience. On the first morning at breakfast, the waiter appeared quite annoyed after we had to ask him twice for some water. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel after the first day. We had other issues such as no towels in the room after returning at 9:00pm one night, running out of soap on the last day and no robes in the room. All these small inconveniences added up to a disappointing stay at a hotel that is supposed to provide a luxury experience.< /Review><Time>1408233600000</Time>< rating>

<Review>The stay itself was great. Unfortunately my son left some expensive USF sweats and I called the next day when we arrived home and was told they would look and call me back. No one ever called back. Then I called again and was told they would have to check with the person who cleaned the room. No one called back. I just called again, 3 days after I checked out and was told they did not see the sweats there. Poor customer service.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I have stayed here 4 years in a row, 2 times my rooms were not ready. The hotel is older, has character, and could be better maintained. However my biggest issue is it appears to be mismanaged. Rooms not ready upon check in, and we were encouraged to request late check out, I am not sure why as this probably leads to unready rooms. We watched the maids and it took an hour to ready 1 room. This seems excessive and inefficient.<//Text>< Time>

The Palace Hotel is our favorite to stay when in San Francisco. Right in the heart of Union Square, it is close to shopping, restaurants and local transportation. It is beautiful and offers nice amenities such as a large pool, sauna, and work out room. The staff is always top notch.<//text>

< Review>
I recently paid for four rooms during a conference. One of the rooms did not have clock or clock/radio. There was a visible coffee spill that remained visible for four days on the marble stairway. Most troublesome was an unauthorized room charge from the onsite Pied Piper Bar and Grill. Despite repeated requests, we have not received a call or e-mail back from the accounting department. We won't be visiting this place again.</Review>

My wife and I stayed at the Palace Hotel this past week end. This was probably my poorest experience at a Starwoods property ever. As a frequent traveler, details matter to me and there was clearly no attention to detail in this property:
- we arrived at 3:30pm to check in. The front desk lady told us that our room was being finished up and was not immediately ready. She offered a temporary room while ours was being finished. We agreed and told her we wanted to take a shower and she said it was fine and probably by the time we finished our shower, our main room would be ready. She took my cell phone number and said she would call once the room was ready. An hour past and no call! I called the front desk and someone picked up and said they would check and call me back. After about 10 minutes, I called again. This time, they finally did call me back and said the room was ready at last. A manager came to our temporary room and brought us the key. She said they had not called because she had been told by the front desk lady that we had gone out for a few hours and would return later!
- I called to ask if we could get a couple toothbrush amenity kits and shampoo. After about ten minutes, someone came to our room with just one toothbrush amenity kit and no shampoo. We had to call again...
- I called to ask where the mini bar prices were and the person on the phone could not answer me. She said it might be on the TV if I go through the menu items...
- During that same call, I asked if there were any olatinum lounges at the hotel. She had no idea what I was talking about and told me about the bar and the restaurant
- Sunday morning, we called to ask for an additional coffee capsule for the coffee machine we had in our room. At first the person on the phone did not get it and asked twice if we want a coffee machine! Finally when she got it, she said she would send us a capsule. After waiting 30 minutes, we gave up and left the hotel. We checked out earlier than we had initially planned for

No single incident was a red flag in its own but the accumulation of them made our experience very poor. We had much greater expectations from such a property in the Starwoods portfolio.</Text>

The checkin agents are sniffy, unhelpful, and they do not take care of the regular items. In addition - no valet or doorman was available when we returned our car late at night. The neighborhood is not entirely safe so this poses a danger as well as an inconvenience. The behavior of the staff should be easy to fix by bringing in new people. but they have not been fixed for years. The advantage for guest is that your hotel is a bargain, because people who know, do not want to stay there.< /text>

<text>I booked this hotel through the Fine Hotels and Resorts program offered by American Express. When we arrived, our reservation was not noted under this program. The gentleman at the front desk was loud and frankly unhelpful. I contacted American Express and they immediately contacted the manager on duty. She came out immediately and corrected the error... promising my amenity to be brought to the room later that day. Much to my surprise, when we returned to the room, no amenity and she had gone home for the day. I then contacted the manager on duty... he sent up a beautiful amenity. The front desk knowing that we had three guests staying one of the nights did not have the sofa bed made up. No sheets in the room for us to make up either. The room was not cleaned upon our return late afternoon. All in all, the facilities are wonderful, but over priced (breakfast buffet $30)... and the staff needs to be more detailed oriented for this level of hotel.</text>< Pictures>

For the amount of money I spent to stay one night I was expected a room with a view, which is what I booked, and a shower that worked properly. It was a Luke warm shower, that made a loud pitch squeaking sound when on, and got plugged up after 15 minutes. The only other thing I experienced was the dining area which didn't have much of a selection and was very overpriced. I did expect more from such an elegant hotel.</Review>

In general a nice place to stay....however, we didn't sleep much as we (again!) were placed in a room at the farthest end of the building overlooking the alley and parking structure & next to the service stock room and elevators. Woken up at 1am by loud rumbling noises and later by garbage trucks in the alley. This was a paid room and NOT a free night reservation. Gold status and being a repeat guest here doesn't seem to make much of a difference!<//text>

<review>We love the palace hotel, as it is where we stayed when we got married in the city. However, this time when we stayed, our room was so loud. The room next door was having a party until 11 PM. After numerous complaints to the front desk and multiple visits by security to the room, the party eventually went out. However, they again continued their party around 1 AM. I felt like I was back in college during a dorm party. To compensate, we used ear plugs and my husband even had to download a white noise app, but it was still so noisy. It was so loud we could hear the conversations they were having. After paying so much for a hotel, I do not expect to have to deal with such bad disturbances. Palace needs to improve their sound proofing or find better ways to minimize the noises between rooms.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

1. The windows no longer open
2. The toilet paper holder is defective and cut my arm.
3. Wi-Fi connection was unreliable
4. Front desk was non responsive to phone calls for help
On the positive side, eggs benedict in the Garden Court restaurant were perfect.</text>

<userid>None</userid><text>The Palace Hotel looks like a nice hotel, however be warned about the cleanliness of rooms and mediocre food.

I checked-in late to the hotel so I was too tired to complain about the following.

1. Someone's Dirty T-Shirt under the desk
2. 2 double beds - the first bed smelled very bad ( like someones behind)...the 2nd one was fine meaning clean. But, I woked up with the worst neck pain. Be warned the pillows are very low quality and is the matress.
3. rusty water droplets on top of the toilet tank
4. Loud moans from down the hall
5. construction outside
6. Ordered room service for dinner and breakfast - ordered a Coke - it was only 8 ounces. Salsa tasted rotten. Breakfast - the poached eggs were ok, but the toast, bacon and potatoes were uneatable. The orange juice was good.</text>< Date>

<Text>One thing did not sit right: Housekeeping does NOT automatically change the sheets each day. That is unacceptable from a hotel of this caliber. Leaving a card, instructing me in TINY TYPE to place the card back on the bed IF I WANTED THE SHEETS CHANGED is bad. Other hotels instruct the opposite. Everything else, from the valet, door man, registration, restaurants, housekeeping and more WAS PERFECT. Just change the sheets unless I tell you NOT TO CHANGE THEM.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<text>We booked 2 rooms over 30 days in advance, we called ahead for early check in, normal check in is 3PM, we waited for over 2 1/2 hours, the desk staff would say..."it will be just a few minutes while they clean the room.." If i knew it was going to be over 2 hours sitting and waiting I would of stored by bags and taken the family for a movie or walk. Not very professional. When my daughter asked about our room, the staff indicated that I no longer a Gold member, I have been a member for over 20 years, so is that anyway to treat a customer?</text>< Pics>

<text>stayed at the Palace Hotel for one night this past weekend and was not pleased with the room! It was tired, dirty walls, hair all over the bathroom floor, lamp next to bed was broken and no light bulb, empty bottle behind the desk... Not the standard that I accept from a so-called "luxury" property!! The two positives of my stay were the valet and front desk staff were very pleasant and the location was excellent. However, I would not stay here again or recommend to friends and family. I travel to SF 3-4 times each year, and will not stay at the Palace Hotel again.</text></record>

The room was spacious - loved the high ceilings and the reproduction antique furnishings.

The only negative was that early in the morning our toilet became clogged and it took nearly an hour for a plumber to come fix it - which meant we had to go down to the fitness center to use the facilities. We were suprised it took that long for someone to come fix it.<//review>

Great Hotel. With a perfekt location but you can sometimes tell that it has seen a lot of traffic over the years it has been used. That gives the building a nice character but you can tell from scratches in the furniture. Do not expect a perfekt room just because it is a 5 star an pricy it is an old building there will be wear< /review>

<Rate>None< /Rate><text>I was only in San Francisco for 2 nights and was hoping to book W hotel but not successful. I ended up staying at Palace hotel. Overall the location is great and has a super comfy bed. However, there's lots of stains on the carpet and my washroom sink was crack.

I think I was unfortunate to stay at floor 4 as this is where the fitness & pools are located and you can hear a lot of noises during the night as the gym is open 24 hours. Also the hallway looks dirty probably due to the high traffic.

For it to be call a luxury collection, I think a renovation is a must.<//text>< pics>

Please don't limit the Hvac to 75 degrees and put on motion sensor it was freezing at night and woke us up. Please heat the heated pool it's freezing. 
Beautiful hotel but needs work and management should be more accommodating.< /Text>

<text>The bed I was in felt like the spring(s) were sticking into my sides. When neighboring hotel guests were coming in and out of the room, I could hear every door slam. This made it very difficult to get in some rest or a nap.
I didn't fully realize the floor I would be on and the room number I'd be at until I got to my room. I was located right next to the electrical room along with room number 666. It left a very unwelcoming and cheap feel every time I had to walk by these two rooms just to get to my own room. Being next to room 666 and walking by the numbers 666 during my stay over the Easter holiday weekend was greatly disappointing. For that reason alone, I felt I highly overpaid for my short stay and experience at The Palace Hotel.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Paying for wifi was pretty inconvenient. The rooms were small, but loving the bidet in the bathroom. Heated toilet seats as well. Free chocolate man!! Beautiful lobby, they serve you food to either your room or if you're in the restaurant area (which is soooooo pretty) they have a Ghiradelli store inside the hotel and a restaurant called The Pied Piper. Everything was very very fancy and looked very Victorian. Basically if you don't mind spending quite a bit of money then this place is paradise for you.<//Review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>I was looking for a centrally located hotel in San Francisco that was a Starwoods property and had a pool. The Palace was the only hotel I found that met my requirements. The W does not have a pool.

The hotel is located in the business district. The pool is nice and my kids had a good time going swimming. The staff was friendly and helpful.

However, there is NO free internet in the rooms - you have to go to the lobby to get free internet. These days, it is unacceptable to make you pay for internet in your room. Also, I had to pay $60.00 a day to park my car, which was also ridiculous.

The room we had was nice but on the small side - smaller than the other Starwood properties we had stayed at. However, that was not what bothered me about the hotel. The rooms were not properly cleaned. I found a used and dirty q-tip on the bathroom floor along with a half eaten ice cream in the freezer. Also, a careful inspection around the bed (which I always do to check for you know what) showed that it wasn't too clean and I found an M&M on the floor.

While you may not expect a hotel room to be spotless, a used and dirty q-tip in the bathroom was plain disgusting.</Text><Response>None< /Response><user_name>PBTraveler<//user_name><rating>None<//rating><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmapID><user_id>None<//user_id></record>

We are disappointed to find $30 in charges on our bill for literally a two second phone call. That fee is egregious. Additionally in the middle of the night the heater would not turn off and my husband had to have maintenance come to our room and fix the thermostat.< /review>

<Review>Christmas buffet at the palace hotel was wonderful. Outside architecture gives a late 19th century early 20th art nouveau feel and the intior carries this in detail. I had my meal in the garden hall right through the main entrance. The service was wonderful and food was delicious. A few dishes did seem a tad dirty but overall things were clean.<//Review>< Rate>

<date>1534864841721<//date><Text>For a luxury hotel,  the bathroom is really small. But the most unpleasant experience is the dismal water pressure in the shower. You can't get a good warm shower in this hotel because the water pressure is so low. And the wardrobe does even not have a light, this  is not something you would expect in a luxury hotel.<//Text>< pictures>

Great customer service and friendly staff. Overall cleanliness was good, but -1 star because we found a clothing item from a prior guest that housekeeping had missed (behind the curtains).</text>

Very conveniently located to business, great dining, culture, and transportation to explore the region. The staff are consistently pleasant and welcoming and rarely am I greeted without a 'Welcome Back". The rooms, and 'upgrades' are hit and miss but again the staff are extemely responsive.< /review>

<Text>The hotel was very lovely and overal was a nice experience. The only two issues I had with the hotel was the poor quality of the WiFi connection in the room I had and the thinness of the walls. I could hear everything that went on the hotel rooms beside my own. It made sleeping difficult.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>everything was great except when I needed to use the business center to make email copies I was overcharged 19.95 instead of the correct amount of 6.00 which my receipt stated. Too bad guest can't have free use of the business center especially when it is used for something related directly with their stay. In my case, I needed to make a copy of my reservation confirmation.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb</gmap_id></record>

We've been staying at the Palace for years - usually come up at least 2 times a year and stay there - until this recent experience....

After taking a shower on Friday night, the tub filled up with water and wouldn't drain. I called down to the front desk after the shower and asked that they have engineering come up the next day to unplug the drain as standing in dirty soapy water seemed like it was the most hygienic experience....they assured me that they would have someone come the next morning.

We spent my birthday out in the city and didn't come back to the hotel until later that evening....entered the shower around midnight and the exact same thing happened. I called the manager on duty and he asked if they could come fix the problem - we'd already showered and were going to bed to leave the next morning!

I'll never spend my birthday weekend there again!< /text>

My actual stay at the hotel was fine, but I received very poor service a couple of says later in trying to get some documents to my boss who was still at the hotel. Extremely slow, unreliable (things went missing) and nobody answered the phone. Pretty surprising and disappointing at this price point.< /text>

Totally overrated. The location is perfect of course and the building itself is worth a visit, but the rooms are nothing special. Also why on earth does each bed have 4 identical pillows? No selection, all of them are the same.</review>

<rate>None< /rate><review>We were extremely disappointed in the palace. We had made our reservation expecting a luxury hotel and we got a four point, at best. When we checked in, there was no shampoo in our room, so we had to call down for some, while my husband was showering and needed it. All three elevators stopped working while were there and were out for hours. We ordered room service, which not only took a long time, but came uncooked and when sent back, came uncooked again. ( it was a burger) we were given dirty towels, the noise from room to room and room to hallway was loud, and in my opinion this is is not consistent with a luxury hotel.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Incredibly elegant hotel. Looking forward to returning. Book room with valet included and save. Otherwuse valet I believe is $75 per night.

I was there just before Christmas and the decorations were right out of a movie. There is a never-ending list of pluses. Restaurant and bar in hotel. A bit pricey but good. Room service is incredibly fast. Just like their wi-fi internet.

Montgomery BART station is immediately outside hotel. Walk out via Ghirardelli store exit and two steps later you are walking down into BART.

It's an older hotel so rooms are smaller than newer hotels. But quite comfortable.< /review><name>p ablo</name>< rate>

I have always loved your hotel, but had a very disappointing stay this week. After learning of my $455 rate, I opened the door to my room and it hit the bed. The room was VERY small and didn't have hardly any bath counter space. I was also disappointed in how the fitness center has declined. There used to be an attendant who was friendly and offered coffee, fruit, etc. On this trip, the sanitizing wipes and water cups were out of stock and one of the treadmill TVs was broken. Restaurant service was SLOW and steak was very average. Not what I remember from previous stays - seems like corners are being cut..<//review>

#1. The biggest problem for me was discovering in the morning that the door to the adjoining room not only wasn't locked, it wouldn't even latch. That totally creeped me out.
#2. The air fan started and stopped all night, and stopped with a THUD that woke me more than once.
#3. Ethernet network access didn't work in this room.
#4. The bedside lamp used a cheezy compact fluorescent in place of a three-way, so the switch clicks on-on-off-off. C'mon guys, the best places use LEDs!

There were enough little things wrong that it did not feel like a "luxury collection" experience.<//Review>

Don't be fooled by their claim for Sunday brunch; "Expect to pay at least 50.00 per person", during the holiday they double their charges at the Garden Court Sunday Brunch.  It was a lovely brunch but when the bill arrived I wanted to vomit.</review>

The Palace is very comfortable, and not too pricey. It is not quite plush enough for a real romantic getaway, but very nice for a weekend trip with kids or business travel.<//text>

I was happy to return here after 20years. I was disappointed there was no free wifi in the rooms, especially since I am a SPG. Also would like to be able to purchase specialty water in hotel.maybe there should be a better introduction to where things are located, etc.< /Review>

Hotel has a great location and the lobby area is very nice, but the rooms need to upgraded. Rugs throughout the hallways and room need to be replaced. Room smelled musty upon walking in. Maid service was not very good...out of the two times we requested the sheets to be changed, it was only done once. Bathroom had good water pressure, but was not very clean. Furniture was old, worn, and scratched/marked up. Will look elsewhere when I go again.</Review>

<review>I stayed for 5 day at the Hotel and asked them to change my linens each day. On the third day I noticed that my sheets didn't looked changed so I tested the theory and put a touch of make up on the pillow case and sheet. When I got back to my room and the bed was made - the make up was still on each article. What else aren't they cleaning - yuck!! Don't stay here if you want a clean room!!< /review></record>

<Review>During the stay there I was concerned about an issue with card keys that did not work, I had to make a second trip to the desk in order to open my door after returning to the hotel from meetings. From my room in the morning I could hear staff workers in the hallways talking very loudly while they worked, which made it uncomfortable and disruptive. Staff was not very accommodating and was unclear about breakfast services. What was most frustrating was the services after my visit when I did not receive my room bill via email as promised by the desk clerk, and was later notified of a $XXX amount charge on my card from my bank. When I inquired with the clerk over the phone, services were rude, representatives over the phone transferred my calls without confirming who or what I was looking for. I had to call multiple times, each time being transferred to a different department because of the lack of confirmation, and each transfer resulted in yet another poorly recorded voicemail. When I checked on my SPG account online, points were missing from my two night stay despite the fact that I had checked with the desk clerk before I left to prevent this from occurring.< /Review><gmap_id>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmap_id>< Response>

<review>Disappointed that this hotel is included as part of the luxury collection. The only thing that made it part of the collection was the cost. The carpets are worn and the dining options are poor at best. Also as a gold SPG member, no real benefits received.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Unfortunately, this hotel underwhelmed me. The room could have been cleaner, service should have been faster, and the Keurig was moldy. If you would like pictures of any of the above please let me know. Also, the hairdryer didn't work and when I requested a replacement I needed to call three times before one was delivered - this was in the morning when someone staying would clearly be rushed!< /text><time>1404864000000< /time><Name>Addie28< /Name><UserId.>None< /UserId.><Rate>None</Rate></record>

Hotel location is great and rooms are good.
Insulation between rooms is not adequate for early showers.
Also, when arriving late room may not be available (even when booked for late arrival)< /text>

I checked the availability for the suites and there were a lot available but when I was checking in the clerk said no Platinum member upgrade was available. I explained there were several suites showing up on the Starwood site. He said those are paying rooms, the suites are thousands of dollars a night. Like I have never stayed at such a room. I felt like my Platinum status was worth nothing here. I was very disappointed and felt belittled by the clerk. Then he said that we were getting a great Grand Deluxe room which was an upgrade, but when I got to the room it was just the regular room that I had booked. I called guest services and again the operator said that we do not upgrade to suites because we are a Luxury Hotel Collection. Why have the rooms sit there without being occupied, makes no sense and that is was Platinum membership is for.

When we got to the room the bathroom floor had hair on it and the sink also had dirt, my wife noticed it. Otherwise the room was nice. We liked the hallways very old looking along with the door knobs.
I used the valet for parking but when I came back to the hotel at around 2AM there were no attendants outside, no valet. My wife went to the front desk and the clerk didn't know where the valet was so we had to park our car and leave the keys with the clerk. A luxury hotel should have someone up front at all times even late at night.<//Review>

<review>The only thing lower than the service standard was the quality & upkeep of the rooms. The room decor was tired and in desperate need of updating. Most of the TV stations did not work, the carpeting was filthy, and the wood furniture was badly scuffed. The walls were also in need of new paint. I would recommend you avoid this "landmark". NOT UP TO STARWOOD OR LUXURY COLLECTION STANDARDS.< /review><rate>None<//rate>< Name>

<Rate>None< /Rate><Review>We made our reservation based on the recommendation of friends, who are frequent guests at the hotel, and the room description and photos on the website. From there it went downhill.

Although the website and out confirmation indicated health club/pool, we were told at checkin that there was no available health club. We booked a Superior Room at 300 sq. ft., but the room did not resemble the photo or description on the website. There was only one night stand, rather than the two in the photo as the room was not large enough to accommodate two. There was no comfortable chair with ottoman, as in the website photo, as there clearly was no room for that either. The desk chair had a chunk of the padding missing. Not attractive.

When we called the front desk to check out, I indicated that if the total amount was the same as the electronic version of the folio sent to me that morning, I was fine with the bill. However, later in the day I received another electronic folio which had increased the total since my conversation with the front desk, by adding another day of parking. Thus charging me for three days of parking @$59/day for a two day stay at the hotel.

Needless to say, I was very disappointed with my stay at the Palace Hotel. The one bright spot was that, with one exception, the staff was very friendly.<//Review>< pictures>

<response>None<//response><review>I don't write reviews on hotel stays, but this one is really bad that I had to vent.

We had dinner in the city and decided to stay at this hotel instead of taking BART home in the evening so we could have a restful evening. We were given a 2nd floor room (normally, we get upgraded to higher floor being GOLD members). We got to our room and had an early night just to be waken up by LOUD music (it looks like our room was on top of the venue) . Upon our phone call to front desk, we were informed that the event was finishing and music should be stopping any moment. 30 minutes after, the music was still there, and still loud, we couldn't sleep (except for our young children who had fallen asleep earlier). We called again and this time we were told the music is on until midnight. We were offered to transfer to a higher floor and we agreed. We had to pack our stuff, wake up the children and transfer. It wasn't a restful evening after all. The hotel should have a guideline on the level of sound the event should have. The music (live band in this case) was way too loud!

Upon getting home today, we received the final bill by email. Instead of using our points (12,000 points), we were billed in USD. Called them, and admitted they made a mistake.

I don't think we will go back to The Palace.<//review></record>

My wife booked this hotel because we generally like older hotels, but the Palace is an older hotel that has not retained the benefits of thick walls and custom craftsmanship. Instead, you can hear every neighbor, and the hotel is so thinly staffed with rude, snooty, outright pretentious personnel (except for the cleaning crew which were courteous and very friendly) that it's downright offensive to pay to stay in this hotel to be treated like filth. The reception desk staff and concierge should all be fired at this location - or sent to charm school. Perhaps San Francisco Palace Hotel staff are so high on their greatness that they don't give a damn about service, but with a number of far better, much friendlier hotels within just a few blocks of this hotel, I highly recommend that potential guests choose the other hotels over this one and have a drink in the Pied Piper (at most) but don't wast your money on the rooms at the Palace (and certainly not the service). Even the response to my review on TripAdvisor was snotty - completely dismissive of my concerns about the staff at this hotel... as if they didn't bother reading the review before responding. Like is said on TripAdivsor - from the moment you enter this hotel right through checkout you feel like this hotel is being managed on the cheap. Chintzy for a "Luxury Hotel".<//Review>

I found the security of this hotel is pretty weak. There is a homeless guys slept on the hotel sofa at late night. The service of the front desk is not really welcoming.

Beautiful historic facility, convenient location, exceptional personalized service, comparable to several high end European properties that I’ve stayed at over the last three years, but at a more modest cost.</Text>

As always the Palace far exceeded my expectations. No mattter if it is the front desk, or in the Pied Piper Grill or the Garden Atrium for breakast the surroundings, service and quality are always top shelf.<//review>

1. Service so poor, front door man doesn't open the door for you, maid in the hall way take to each other, they don't care guest is walking by, smile to them they look away......
2. security is terrible
3. room condition is not good, the refrigerate make noise all night , the windows doesn't block noise....they don't even have coffee machine in the room.
However I do recommend go there have lunch.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Haven't stayed at the Palace for 10+ years, but it's as I remember it...dirty with poor service. My room had dirty carpets from the entry into the room with hair and trash on the bathroom floor. There was no coffee/tea maker in the room (hotel said it's only available in suites), so, I requested hot water or an electric kettyla and the person on the phone made it sound like it was such a task that I did so. After 35 minutes, i called again to ask for the a water kettle. Only after my second call, did room service show up with a Keurig coffee maker which doesn't make tea, so I asked for a teak kettle. While I was waiting for the kettle, I happended to read the framed news clipping hanging on the wall next to the front door and was suprised that it contained disparaging remarks about Japanese and Japan which is ironic given the property is owned by a Japanese company.

Overall, the room cleanliness, amenities, and service experience was terrible, not to mention the cultural insensitivity of the furnishings.

Definitely the poorest run "upscale" hotel in San Francisco.< /Text>< date>

This is not the hotel built by William Chapman Ralston back in the year of 1875. The Palace Hotel was destroyed by fire in the 1906 earthquake. The New Palace Hotel as it was called opened in 1909.
Ralston did save his banking empire from ruin in the 1860's National depression with a cleverly devised scheme, but unfortunately he lost everything including his life in 1875, two months before the Palace Hotel opened. It was Ralston's business partner U. S. Senator William Sharon who had helped cause the collapse of Ralston's Bank when he dumped his stock in the Comstock Lode. Sharon ended up in control of the hotel as well as both the Bank and Ralston's debts, both of which he paid off at just pennies on the dollar.</Text>

I had some pleasant and unpleasant moments here. During breakfast I asked waiter why poached eggs has hard yolk. He offered me to bring new portion of poached eggs. I agreed. He brought it when I did finish my dessert. And inew eggs was again hard boiled. I refuse from it, but found in my bill $20 extra charge for that "eggs order". What a shame. But this problem was quickly resolved by very nice and professional manager. When waiter did see that I talk to manager - he promptly brought back eggs I refused and put it on my table like I accepted it. Shame again.
Porter told us that there is beautiful swimming pool at 4th floor. Kids were excited and we went there first thing, but pool is far below average. Shower in men locker room does not have shower head. Towels are old and lost it whitemess ages ago. Sad impression from pool visit we had.
Valet is crazy expensive and does not deliver in timely manner. I started to call at 8:40 to ask my car be ready at 9. Phone was busy, and at 8:45 I called front desk. They promised me to request my car and took my ticket number. And they didn't perform this. I received my car at 9:25 and I was late for my appointment. Not cool.
But most of staff is professional, friendly and goid-looking.
I received no upgrade and stayed in room with no view (most room has no view as I can see from plan).
But hotel's ground floor interiors are fabulous and very impressive.</text>

Room and bathroom were dirty. Surfaces in bathroom were dust filled as if room had not been cleaned in months. Will never stay again. Going to try St. Regis. Embarrassed to say this is a Starwood Hotel. No benefit to Starwood members to staying there.< /text>

It is unfortuante that a hotel of this size that offers blocks of rooms would not be prepared for the thought that block/business travel includes an expense report which means individaul checks at meals. Although - The food was excellent!< /Text>

<Text>The hotel is good enough, but the valet parking is the worst in my life experience. We stayed 4 nights in this hotel, and the avg waiting time for getting our car is about 45 mins. We have to call the valet parking once we woke up. Next time I would look for a self parking garage nearby and park my vehicle there.< /Text><userid>None< /userid>< gmapID>

The hotel is really lovely and well located but I found it lacking when in town for a conference. Despite Plat Pref status had a double room right over the taxi stand, very noisy The wireless is painfully slow and the food in the lobby restaurant was expensive and not really up to the local standards.<//Text>

The room rates for this hotel were quite reasonable ("I thought") especially for its opulent antiquity and all its magnificence.  However, with that being said, this is "definitely" not a place to stay if you're looking for an inexpensive place to lay your head down!

One of the big shortcomings that I found at this magnificent hotel was the "parking," which there wasn't any along the street and even if you could find one, I personally wouldn't park my new vehicle because of the surrounding neighborhood.

The hotel charges a fee of $59.00 for overnight parking which I find preposterous but I guess it's better than the alternative of seeing your vehicle on blocks and your wheels missing!  "Ya, I know, I'm being paranoid, but I know things that only cops know!"

My first impression of this place from the outside is that it's extravagant looking.  Walking inside of this place makes you feel like your stepping back into time!  The interior looks like a set out of a movie scene with its old style design and elegance.

The lobby is amazing in its old style décor and you feel like you're reliving the early 1900's!  Too bad the prices don't reflect that era!

With our discounts you can stay in one of their "Superior Rooms," which is their basic elegant room with stylish old time furniture's.

A walking tour of the inside of this hotel is really an experience breathtaking to see, especially in the old dining room.

The Palace Hotel pool looked old fashioned and with the enclosed clear ceiling roof, kept out the notorious San Francisco sea chill that it's famous for.

The Garden Court Restaurant, which was designed in the early 1990's, is very elegant but to me the prices were expensive but then again, I guess it goes into the upkeep of the place!

With our family being "everything computer related" the hotel charges a $15.00 fee for WIFI!

Some notable events at the hotel:

In 1891, the monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii at the time, King Kalakaua, died on January 20, 1891.

In 1919, former president, Woodrow Wilson gave speeches in the Garden Court in support of the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations.

In 1923, Warren G. Harding's term as President ended suddenly when he died at the Palace Hotel, in Room 8064, an eighth floor suite that overlooks Market Street.

In 1945, the Palace Hotel hosted a banquet to mark the opening session of the United Nations.

In 1954, the hotel was sold to Sheraton Hotels and became the Sheraton-Palace Hotel.

In 1959, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev spoke at a banquet at the Sheraton-Palace during his American tour.

In 1969, the Garden Court was declared a San Francisco Landmark.

In 1973, the hotel was bought by the Japanese Kyo-Ya group, along with all of their hotels in the Hawaiian Islands.  Sheraton continued to manage the hotel and the name stayed the same.

In 1984, the entire structure of the Sheraton-Palace was declared a landmark.

From January 1989 to April 1991, the Sheraton-Palace Hotel undergoes a $150 million restoration that garnered national media attention and numerous awards.

In 1990's the hotel dropped the Sheraton name and transferred to another division of Starwood Hotels, The Luxury Collection, becoming, again, the Palace Hotel.

In 1997, the finale of the David Fincher film The Game, starring Michael Douglas, was shot in the Garden Court.

In 2013, the famous Maxfield Parrish painting which still hangs in the equally famous Pied Piper Bar was removed and scheduled to be auctioned off at Christie's but strong public opposition to its removal, however, the hotel's owners relented and instead had the painting cleaned, restored, and returned to the bar where it was rehung with considerable fanfare on August 22, 2013.

Over the years, the Palace Hotel has had many guests from such notables as former presidents, George Bush, Woodrow Wilson, and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, to football greats like Joe Montana and Singer Donna Summer to name just a few!

Overall, our stay here was memorable!</text>

<text>Pulled up to the hotel and saw a sign for palace parking, we pulled into the lot and two guys watching tv in a booth looked up at us and kept watching their show, my husband walked over and said we needed to park. We grab our bags and crossed a very busy intersection with no cross walks and came inside.

We walked up to the front desk and wait for someone to help us, finally two men came out of the office and helped us.

We paid 230 for an extremely basic room facing another Window.

Ordering room service- we were not impressed with the food, the bar down stairs was extremely muggy and smelly.

Finally when checking out it took so long to get our car back from the garage, we waited around for awhile.

When driving away we realized they charged us 60$ for one night of parking. I thought this could be a mistake so I called and asked to talk to someone. The woman on the phone informed us that parking was in fact 68.28/per night, I was shocked! I asked why we were never informed and she said valets only tells you if you ask. I asked why in the world they would charge people that price and never tell them? She asked if I would walk into a store and purchase things without asking the prices... Wait WHAT?! The worst customer service I've ever experienced.

The cherry on top was the 200$ deposit that took from our account without telling us!!!

Added two stars: finally talked to KC the manager and he refunded the parking and apologized for the customer service. Thank you for your help!<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808580881f0c9dd7:0xbe09e1083f7d7fcb< /gmapID></record>

The rooms were a bit small, but the architecture was beautiful.  The views from most of the rooms weren't the best, some had views of an alley where bums seemed to have taken residence.  We attended a banquet in the Grand Ballroom, the service was dissapointing.  The staff seemed very inattentive and the food was sub par.< /Review>

<Text>shockingly bad service for a so called luxury collection hotel. If you request for something - be it tissue that ran out or a pillow - there’s less than a 50% chance it will ever arrive. Unless you call 2-3 more times. And anytime you leave your room, the housekeeping staff will keep chasing you on when you expect to checkout despite you telling them the time. Oh and they’ll just enter your room to drop off amazon packages for other people.< /Text>< Pics>

Every time that I tried to get into my room, the key card did not work. The first time it occurred I accepted the response from the front desk that I need to keep it away from phones, etc. However the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. time when I kept the key completely away from my phone and the key card still didn't work it was very frustrating.</review>

Was really looking forward to spending the weekend at the Palace Hotel, but ended up being sorely disappointed..the breakdown:

Pros:
- Location
- Beds (I could sleep all day!)
- Shower

Cons:
- HOTEL STAFF / CUSTOMER SERVICE: Gosh, as a Gold member and previous Platinum member who has traveled extensively for work (Monday - Thursday) and for pleasure (28 countries) the Palace definitely takes the cake for rudest, most uppity front desk customer service. While the hotel itself is beautiful, I would not recommend this to anyone who will need services beyond check-in.
- ROOM SERVICE: The food was awful. Such a waste of $50. Overpriced and did not live up to a Luxury Collection standard.
- ATTITUDE: The Palace will nickel and dime you for anything and everything.</review>

<time>1388448000000<//time><Rate>None<//Rate><Text>The wall of the Palace Hotel are paper thin and the rooms surrounding my suite were overcrowded with partiers and families with noisy children. I never had more than a two hour window of quiet to sleep, with all the activity. Security was called on the partiers, so it was documented. Management never offered compensation. Too many guests are crowding into small rooms. I had an expensive suite and a vacation with no sleep.<//Text>< Pictures>

Was very underwhelmed with this hotel - nothing special or memorable. On top of that lots of noise in middle of both nights we stayed in the halls - took a long time for security to arrive to settle the drunken guest. Should have stayed at Westin or W - we are never disapointed there< /Text>

It's pretty neat architecturally. You don't often have buildings or hotels like this especially outside of California and New York.< /Review>

I used Suite Night Awards and was given a Junior Suite, which was essentially a slightly larger regular room. When I inquired about getting an upgrade to an available standard suite, I was offered an "upsell" where I could pay for this. Housekeeping was poor, and there was no turndown service for two of the four nights. Coffee and cups were never replaced one morning.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I was unable to get wifi reception in the room on any of my devices and your technical support staff told me in the end they could not help me at all. This is RIDICULOUS as I could not work at all in my room. This was a big black mark on my stay here. This was a business trip so I'm not sure I would recommend this hotel for business trips.< /Review>

<review>Well I would compare the room to what you would find in a super 8 motel. Paper thin walls, the springs in the hard bed pop when you move. Very old stylings.. If you are from the USA you wouldn't like it..holiday inn Express, Hilton's wyndham's, westin's and others are far superior in quality and comfort.. dont spend $3XX plus here.. The Staff was by far the most friendliest I have ever met but that doesn't make up for the old rooms..No down bedding, and the sheets smell old.. No fridge or in room safe..oh and finally the TV has a really great picture :-)<//review>< pics>

Our stay at the palace Hotel was somewhat disappointing. The rooms were small as well as small bathrooms. the rooms cold use new carpeting and some brightening up. the worst thing was the disgusting black water that came from the shower head on several occasions. i would not recommend this hotel to a friend.</Text>

<Review>We have gone to the Palace on a couple of occassions and always enjoyed our stay,
however this time we ordered dinner from room service, my husband ordered a steak
medium rare and it came so well done and tough he couln't eat it, the potatoe was very
old and hard, the quesida was dripping with grease.  The dinner was very expensive.
The next morning after waiting for 30 minutes to tell the manager he said he would
credit back the charges but this was never done.
We are very disapointed with the food and the customer service</Review>< pics>

<username>Amy Nadeau</username><text>My husband and I came down from Canada and stayed here for our anniversary and a 30th birthday celebration and it was not a good experience. We had many problems and no one seems to care to fix them or make then right.

1.	The Wi-Fi was terrible and we could hardly connect to it in our room. When we mentioned this to the Front desk agent he took the Wi-Fi charge off our bill. The only thing they did right.

2.	When showering there was a dark grey substance that came out of the shower head. It covered our bodies and no matter how hard we tried we could not get it off. We had to spend the entire day looking filthy. When we checked out we told the front desk agent about it. He looked for a manager to speak to us but he couldn’t find one, he assured us that a manger would contact us right away and we would be compensated for this.

We never got a call, so a few days later I called and spoke to a front office manager. She apologized and said that she would give us a free night stay through SPG points. I don’t have SPG card, so she was going to sign me up for one and follow up with a call or email. It has now been over two weeks and I have not received an email or a call from this lady. Therefore I have no clue if she did what she said.

3.	They also over charged our credit card over $200. We brought this to their attention multiple times and they just told us that it was a Pre-authorization since we dined at the hotel. That charge has not come off the CC yet.

They have had every chance to make this right and they didn’t even try. Starwood is a trusted name to us and The Palace has really let us and Starwood down.</text>< user>

< review>
We were checked in with two separate confirmations due to a free night using points. The gentleman behind the desk told us he was able to keep us in the same room for the 3 nights, and we appreciated it. That night at 3am we were awakened by someone trying to open the door. I finally got out of bed to tell them the room was occupied. At this time I called the front desk and let them know what happened. Fifteen minutes later there was knocking at the door-it was hotel personnel. At 6am there was someone else knocking at the door, but we did not get up. The next morning we talked to the manager on duty, and she apologized for the inconvenience. She explained it was a computer error. No problem, things like that happen. When we returned to our room later, our room had not been serviced. We were told we would have water and breakfast vouchers waiting, and we received neither. The next morning my husband spoke to another manager who gave him our vouchers and when we returned to the room it was not serviced, but there was water for us. We were most disappointed, especially since it was an expensive stay for us.</review>

<Review>An overall unsatisfactory stay, where virtually no request was handled well. Service in the main restaurant for breakfast was slow and pretentious. My mother (who was also staying at the hotel in a different room) valet-parked her car and it failed to arrive 25 minutes after we'd called for it. Room was cramped with no space in the bathroom. Front desk staff gave out the wrong information about restaurant hours, etc. Evening restaurant reservation was difficult to make by phone prior to arrival and was apparently non-existent when we did arrive. The list could go on...</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< rate>

My initail assigned room which I prepaid was in poor shape. Cracked bathroom sink, ripped carpeting, and furnitire all chipped and scuffed. I was moved to an upgraded room, but it was only larger but conditions were the same.
In addition, there was a huge conference that spilled into the lobby and restaurants and bars that made the street floor extremely chaotic. If I was told of the conference i would have selected another SPG hotel.</text>

Carpet had bad stains. Very old furniture with chips of wood falling off. Bathroom floor not clean at all most of the time when unused too. WE asked for extra toilet paper and tissues and had to call 4 times before we got it after 1 hour. Not impressed at all</text>

<text>今まで利用したホテルではトップクラスの評価です。歴史のある建物、調度品、落ち着いた他のゲスト、スタッフの対応、全てが素晴らしかった。又、アメリカのホテルでウオッシュレットが設置されているとは思いませんでした。駅は目の前で移動も便利です。帰りに空港へ向かうときタクシーがいなかったのですが、スタッフからホテルカーを勧められ５９ドルで利用できました。タクシーと大差ない値段です。< /text><date>1451779200000<//date>< user>

EN EL SPA Y GIMNASIO LA CALIDEZ Y EL TRATO DE LA SEÑORA ENCARGADA QUE NOS ESPERA DESDE LAS 05:00 HORAS ES ESTUPENDA. BRINDA CONFIANZA Y RESULEVE TODO. ES LO MEJOR DEL HOTEL Y ESO QUE ES MUY BUENO EN TODOS LOS ASPECTOS.< /Review>

When we arrived in our room the bathroom smelled like urine. We wiped it down with a towel and soap to get rid of the smell. Shower valve got stuck in on position had to have maintenance shut it off. 4 guest only 3 sets of towels, had to request an extra set each day we stayed at the Palace. We did not enjoy our stay and we checked out 1 night early.</review>

The entrance is grand and so is the lobby! Though I did not stay here, I just loved the the automatic toilets that not only clean your bum but also dry it; plus heated seats!</Review>

Too much to write. Just do yourself a favor and do not stay at this property until corporate closes the loop with the strike. It was a horrific 4-day business trip. No room service, lack of options in lieu of strike (water bottles and chips?), lack of resolve when room was not cleaned although requested.<//text>

仕事の関係で毎年夏にはサンフランシスコを訪れるが、過去20年間ここに泊まっている。ホテルの前で車をさばくボーイ達も20年選手で顔なじみ、毎回思うがホテルに着いた時の応対が素晴らしい。旅に来た！と思わせる玄関の格式ある構えとボーイ達の仕事ぶりにいつも驚かせられる。</text>

<review>Love this place, had a great time, but the rooms are noisy and you can hear the neighbors as if they were in the room with you, which is unfortunate because it is otherwise a great spot...<//review></record>

<text>A small room with a very cramped bathroom and a noisy and empty minibar.
Cheekily charged me for a Cappuccino on top of an already overpriced fixed breakfast buffet.

it's only redeeming quality was that the room was clean.

An overpriced experience not to be repeated.< /text>< name>

My wife and I were in a hurry leave with our 2 month old baby. I went down to get a luggage cart and the guy at the front desk wouldn’t let me use one. Had to carry all our bags down by hand. What a joke.</review>

This is supposed to be a 5-star hotel and part of the “Luxury Collection” There was no luxury to be found here.

1. When I checked in the front desk person tried to charge me $80 more per night – he ended up trying to check in another person with another rate
2. Took 20 minutes to check-in
3. Was not upgraded on night 1 and stayed in a room that was only 300 square feet
4. Packed my bags again in the morning and dropped off at bell stand and was treated very rudely – person told me to bring my bag to him in front of the stand vs. him walking over to me at the front desk and getting it from me.
5. Night 2 – Went to get my keys and again they had the wrong room rate -- $xxx vs. $xxx and again I had to find the hotel manager this morning to have the bill adjusted.
6. Last night, I took the advice of the concierge and went to the sushi restaurant at the hotel – this was a nightmare. I have copied in the manager of the restaurant on this email.
a. Took me 10 min. to get my order taken
b. Took over 25 min. for my sushi to be delivered.
c. Was told the restaurant was understaffed.<//Text>

From the moment we checked in there were issues. The lady at the front desk didn't even want to explain to us where the facilities were, where breakfast was etc. We then were charged an authorization check on our card (which is routine), but usually we are told this before it happens. Instead, I get charged without any communication from the lady at the front desk. Then, we get upstairs and notice that the mini bar is totally empty, which is strange. Not only that, the few lights in the room weren't working. We didn't want to make this into a huge deal so we headed out for dinner and came back. At night, the fire alarms go off for 10-15 minutes without any warning. I was scared and alarmed as it was 1:30am. Then, again the fire alarms go off at 9:00am, but this time at least there was a reason. So we couldn't sleep in more and we couldn't even take a nap in the morning. In the morning, we did not even get a final receipt slipped under our door, again a routine practice. Long story short, would not recommend this place.</text>< Pics>

I've stayed many times before and it's real yin need of a renovation. My room was loud, both from street noise and loud televisions and voices. I was overall disappointed and not likely to stay again.<//Review>

Liike most business travellers I object to paying for internet services in the room- as a personal preference I'd rather make coffee in the room than get dessed and go downstairs, and I guess I might be spoiled but a bathrobe, would be nice.</review>

For the rating and nightly rate that this hotel has-I expected a lot more. No mini-bar, no robes, minimal pillows, a parking fee of $60/night, and not much of a room service selection. Very disappointing.<//Review>

<Review>Pool skylight leaking and little or no maintainence at the pooside. Hotel shows signs that painting is not maintained, and niceties are no longer included, ie robes, soft towels, stationery, etc. I wish it was the Palace of 10 years ago, but sadly it isn't . And the charge for parking is just outrageous...< /Review>< pics>

11月入住此酒店，第一印象就是酒店如同它的名字，就像一个宫殿，大堂的下午茶非常有特色，入住后是一个升级的套房，房间豪华，非常的大。而且酒店位置非常好，门口就是地铁口，非常方便。</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Lobby and facilities are clean, nice and grand.

I don't know where to stay because I'm not staying at hotel, but the meeting and meeting rooms are also neat.

Great lobby and restaurant interior

(Original)
로비와 시설이 깔끔하고 멋있고 웅장하게 만들어짐.

호텔객식 숙박을 하지는 않아서 객실 상태는 모르겠지만 회의 미팅룸도 깔끔한 편임.

로비와 레스토랑쪽 인테리어는 훌륭함< /Review>< pictures>

Dieses Hotel ist jeden Cent wert. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, die Zimmer sind sehr sauber, das Bett ist überaus bequem und die Lage ist aufgrund der Nähe zu diversen öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln perfekt für alle Aktivitäten rund um San Francisco. Morgens bietet das Hotel einen kostenlosen Kaffee- und Teeservice, den man sich in der Lobby zubereiten kann. Das interkontinetale Frühstücksbuffet im Restaurant ist das bisher beste, leckerste und variierendste Frühstücksangebot, das ich in den USA gegessen habe. Sehr zu empfehlen und sein Geld wert. Als exklusiven Bonus hatte ich mit meiner Buchung auch ein Upgrade für kostenfreies WLAN im Zimmer. Ein perfekter Städtetrip.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The location is good and luxurious but the price is a bit high. Breakfast is very expensive for the quality. The room is poorly lit and its structure makes it easy to look in other rooms. The service level is fine but it's hard to give a high score overall.

(Original)
위치가 좋고 고급스럽지만 가격이 좀 높습니다. 조식이 질 대비 가격이 많이 높네요. 방에 채광이 잘 안되는데다 구조상 다른 방에서 들여다 보기도 쉽고. 서비스 수준은 괜찮습니다만 전체적으로 높은 점수를 주기는 어렵네요.<//text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) It is a beautiful hotel dating back to 1909 a real treasure for this city, comfortable rooms, excellent service, but in my opinion it is somewhat expensive, I think it is excessive and I really do not see it necessary to spend as much money in a hotel in a city like San Francisco

(Translated by Google) Central hotel, with a very nice lobby, but I expected the truth more, small closets, and the cleaning leaves much to be desired, if you raise the bathroom windows you are horrified, the curtains and windows are super dirty, the wiffi does not go, the empty minibar, The small bathroom. You can ask for a package of data that they offer on their website, but at the reception they tell you they don't have it.
As I said I expected more.

Puedes pedir un paquete de datos que ofrecen en su web, pero en recepción te dicen que no tienen.

(Translated by Google) A beautiful old fashioned hotel, once one of the largest in the world. Feel the spirit of the old days, when you stroll through the wide, richly decorated corridors, you sip a drink in the bar, or you eat lunch in a restaurant under a glass dome ... Beautiful.

Rooms in the hotel are a mistake. They have the Novotel standard for a much higher price, they are small and tight for five stars. It is outrageous that the hotel describes rooms as having a seating area, which in practice turns out to be a small bench in front of the bed. Tragedy. In the room there is no kettle, no coffee or even a bar. Very slow service at check-in. five-hour hotel awaits over half an hour! The swimming pool in the object is a small, not worth the sunset changing into swimsuits. If it were not for the history connected with the object and the fabulous common parts, it does not make sense to spend the night here. Begin the drink at the bar and calmly see everything. Hotel parking twice as expensive than any other in the area.

(Original)
Piękny staroświecki hotel, ongiś jeden z największych na świecie. Czuć ducha dawnych lat, kiedy się przechadzasz po szerokich, bogato zdobionych korytarzach sączysz drinka w barze, albo jesz lunch w restauracji pod szklaną kopułą... Piękne.

Pokoje w hotelu to jakas pomyłka. Mają standard Novotelu za wielokrotnie większą cenę, są małe i ciasne jak na pięć gwiazdek. Oburzające jest, iż hotel opisuje pokoje jako posiadające część wypoczynkową, która okazuje się w praktyce być małą ławeczką przed łóżkiem. Tragedia. W pokoju brak czajnika, eskpresu do kawy czy nawet barku. Bardzo powolna obsługa przy check-inie. w pięciogwiazdkowym hotelu czeka się ponad pół godziny! Basen w obiekcie mały, nie wart zachodu przebierania się w kąpielówki. Gdyby nie historia związana z obiektem i bajeczne części wspólne, to nie ma sensu wydawać na nocleg tutaj.Prościej wpaść na drinka do baru i spokojnie sobie wszystko zobaczyć. Parking hotelowy dwa razy droższy, niż jakikolwiek inny w okolicy.< /text>

El hotel está hermoso y se siente un ambiente de mucho lujo. Las habitaciones son muy lindas y las camas súper cómodas. La renovación del hotel es impresionante sobretodo al saber que es de los más antiguos de San Francisco y se conserva tan bien. El gimnasio y la alberca son muy lindos y funcionales. Además la ubicación es excelente ya que está sobre Market Street y a sólo unas cuadras de Union Square. El único problema es que el estacionamiento es caro ($72 USD por día completo), pero estacionamientos cercanos por $35 USD por día completo.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The building is quite old but well preserved I was here for a Google developers conference and we got to see the decoration and maintenance of the building.

It has escalators to access the conference rooms and quite long corridors that cross the building to the back street that allow access to all rooms.

In general I think it is a good venue for meetings and events.

(Original)
El edificio es bastante antiguo pero bien conservado estuve aquí para una conferencia de desarrolladores de Google y pudimos ver la decoración y el mantenimiento al edificio.

Tiene escaleras eléctricas para poder acceder a los salones de conferencias y unos pasillos bastante largos que atraviesan el edificio hacia la calle de atrás que permiten acceder a todos los salones.

En General creo que es un buen venue para reuniones y eventos.< /review>

El hotel está hermoso y se siente un ambiente de mucho lujo. Las habitaciones son muy lindas y las camas súper cómodas. El único problema es que el estacionamiento es excesivamente caro ($72 USD por día completo), así es que tuvimos que dejar el coche en un estacionamiento cercano por $35 USD por día completo. El desayuno igualmente es caro ($40 USD el buffet tipo americano), pero hay algunos restaurantes cercanos más accesibles. Realmente vale muchísimo la pena si no traes auto y comes fuera del hotel.</Text>

The hotel is fantastic: the rooms are magnificent, the entry beautiful décor, the bar is well stocked, the wi fi works very well and there is also a well-equipped gym with pool next door. The only flaw is the excessive cost even for all these comforts

Das Hotel ist sehr gut gelegen für Erkundungen: getrübt wurde der Aufenthalt halt nur von der Stadt selber; es ist überall in den Strassen sehr schmutzig und alle paar Meter trifft man auf Randständige, man wird zum Teil auch angepöbelt, sie bewegen sich alle wie Zombies (laut mit unkontrollierten Bewegungen) das ist sehr schade, da ist ganz klar die Stadtverwaltung gefordert!</Text>< pictures>

Superbe Piscine. Le PDJ sous la verrière est un must ( mais 38$ ..). La hall de lhôtel est certainement le plus beau de San Francisco.Très bien situé pour tourisme et shopping.Le rapport qualité prix est somme toute excellent ( grâce à offre Expedia) pour San Francisco où beaucoup dhôtels sont quasiment aussi chers pour beaucoup moins bien.< /text>

<text>El hotel está ubicado de forma privilegiada. Cercano al centro de convenciones, a las mejores tiendas. Es posible acercarse al AT&T caminando, así como al Harbour. 
En la puerta está la parada de metro que permite acceder al aeropuerto en transporte público.
En cuanto a servicios, las habitaciones son amplias, cuidando el servicio que presta y la limpieza. La cama es muy cómoda.</text>< Pics>

We have a reservation for 2 nights. Arrival at 1930, we have been informed that our room was not ready - which is quite surprising and annoying - we have to wait until 2030 to get it !!!Parking valet is pleasant and pro.On the last day, no hot water in the morning - and coincidence, the phone  does not work. As there were no note from the hotel, I have to go to the reception to check whats going on (they said a leak somewhere). I would have appreciated a note in my door to tell me they are working to fix this issue, rather than saying nothing.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Sober hotel in the San Francisco downtow area.
It can be noticed that it is quite crowded and it is still very used by the clients, because it was quite full during my stay.
It is a luxurious hotel with a lot of history.

<text>Vi spenderade 11 nätter här i slutet av Mars 2016. Vi bodde i ett Deluxe Twin Double rum.Fint hotell i gammaldags stil -- väldigt högt i tak i rummen som är nyrenoverade och sobert stilrent inredda. Dock saknas lagringsmöjligheter så du får behålla alla kläder i resväskorna. Det finns en ganska stor garderob men denna är inte så användbar annat än för att hänga ett mindre antal plagg och för att eventuellt lagra väskorna. Det finns ingen belysning i garderoben. Detta är egentligen det enda jag har att anmärka på med rummet. Badrummet var fint och den uppvärmda toalettsitsen/biden var väldigt roande för barnen och frun.Det finns gott om eluttag (dock bara för US plugg). Det finns även en telefon med Android/iPhone (inklusive Lightning) kontakter samt USB-kontakter. Värdeskåpet är dimensionerat så att de flesta laptops/iPad Pro etc får plats med marginal.Frukosten är dyr men Garden Court är väldigt grandios och värd att uppleva åtminstone en gång. För billigare frukost finns alternativ i hörnet av hotellet (Corner Bakery Café). Vi åt inte på någon av restaurangerna och använde inte oss av Room Service så kan inte kommentera detta.Personalen gav ett blandat intryck. En del var väldigt hjälpsamma, andra kändes lite oengagerade. T.ex sade personen som anvisade gäster till bord vid frukosten inte ett ord till oss, vilket var lite märkligt. De som serverade gav dock bättre service.Poolen är inte så djup men bra för barn och funkar för motionssim. Gymmet är också okej.<//text><Resp>None</Resp></record>

(Translated by Google) The subtown area of ​​San Francisco is well known, and the hotel is located on Market Street and service and transportation stations in front of the gate and not far.
Your stay in it will mean many hotels fall from your eyes 😝
Classic design and luxury that knows no end
It has mobile charging connections of various types beside the bed with which you will feel the most beautiful lying down I have known since the day I came to the world.
Try to stay in the upper floors to have a more beautiful view.

<Review>L hôtel est bien placé pour se rendre à pied par tout à San Francisco mais le quartier s, est dégradé depuis notre dernière visite il y a 9 ans. Nous avions une constante sensation d, insécurité des l instant que nous sortions dans la rue.La chambre et belle et spacieuse, propre et la literie confortable mais la petite taille des lits était surprenante pour ce qui est habituel aux US!Déçus a l arrivée, car malgré demander d avoir une chambre rapidement dû à la fatigue du décalage , et manque de sommeil, nous avons du atteindre des 11.00 à 14.00. Une fois arrivés dans la chambre, ils nous ont donné la chambre de quelqu, un d autre!Retour à la réception. A nouveau confusion d un autre réceptionniste, mais à la 3 Eme c était la bonne.Un jour nous avons quitté la chambre après 11.00 et c était plus possible de la nettoyer. Je ne comprenais pas cela, surtout quand le premier jour nous avons dû atteindre 3 heures, jusquà 14.00.Nous n avons pa pu profiter de la piscine, car la température dans l eau et à l extérieur était trop froide.Je n y retournerais pas , d, abord à cause du quartier, insecure et un peu loin des restaurants et le manque du service de l hôtel. Nous avons passé 3 semaines cet été aux États Unis, et c était le plus cher et celui que nous avons moins aimé.<//Review><user_name>Expedia reviewer</user_name><Rating>None<//Rating><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

Einfach ein tolles Hotel aus dem Anfang des 20. Jh. Das Gefühl eines adligen Wohnens. Zimmer war toll und der Service, abgesehen vom fehlenden Portier, der die Tür aufhält und dem Kofferträger, war nahezu perfekt. Das Hotel liegt direkt Downtown, sicher hört man da nach vorne das ein oder andere Auto in der 2. Etage aber nicht allzu laut. Wir würden dieses Hotel jederzeit wieder nehmen. Sicher sind auch die neuen sterilen Hotels interessant aber man hat selten so ein schönes altes Gebäude, welche so gut erhalten ist und gepflegt wird.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Ask-or-not-get hotel. In my practice, this is the first Palace and generally the first five-star hotel with such a frostbitten service. For your money, you buy a location here, check-in "I was at Palace San Francisco" and a really great bed. But no pleasure in staying.
Definitely the next stop is at any decent hotel in the neighborhood: Four Seasons / Ritz Carlton, but definitely not here.

(Original)
Отель категории "Попроси или не получишь". В моей практике это первый Palace и вообще первый пятизвёздочный отель с таким отмороженным сервисом. За свои деньги тут покупаешь локацию, чекин "Я был в Palace San Francisco" и действительно отличную кровать. Но никакого удовольствия от прибывания.
Однозначно, следующая остановка в любом приличном отеле по-соседству: Four Seasons / Ritz Carlton, но точно не тут.< /Text>

<Review>I liked the location, the pool and the comfort of the room. But I didnt like the constant push of the hotel to make more money and to try to make pay everything. You have to pay for wifi in this luxury hotel! Plus, they insist to make a difference between continental and American breakfasts. I did not like the general attitude of the staff that I have found too business oriented< /Review>< pics>

This is a very good hotel with a good location in San Fransisco. You get what you pay for. I liked the bed and the pillow. The bathroom was also good. Although we did not watch much tv I appreciated the big tv screen. We did not have breakfast at the hotel and unfortunately we did not test the hotels interesting cocktail list. I liked the staff.My only complain is about the wifi. In 2017 you should not pay for having access to wifi in your hotel room, not even at a luxury hotel. In the lobby it is for free.<//Text>
