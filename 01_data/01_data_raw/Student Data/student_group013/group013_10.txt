<review>My mom loves duck since the Pandemic we were unable to buy roasted duck at Pacific Super at both Alemany and South City. Went on Google and seen this place. Reviews sold me. Unable to pre-order over phone, it's on a first come first serve basis. Ordered a whole Roasted duck and 1lb of roasted pork and Im happy to say my mom, hubby n bro-in law loved it! I'm not really a fan because there's always a certain taste to asian food which I'm told could be the 5 spices or seasoning idk 🤷‍♀️ Anyways, I'm very glad my mom enjoyed it  for Valentine's day. Now we know where to go when she wants us to grab her a roasted duck since they live in Stanislaus county.</review>< Pictures>

Very good roast duck.  Good noodle soup.  Liked the hand pulled noodles which are slightly thicker than your basic egg noodles; has a good chew to it.  Good oxtail & gravy over rice.  Pictured is the roast duck & soy sauce chicken to go, $13.95, & my leftover noodle soup.<//Text>

<Review>The roasted duck is just the best. My family and I have gone to several places in the bay area for duck and this is one of the best places for it. Just don’t go too late or the duck will be served cold. The soup noodles aren’t that great but things like the congee or stir fried noodles are quite good. The deep fried pork is also quite good. The service isn’t the best but it’s bearable. The only reason we really go back to this place is because of the duck.</Review><name>Jennifer L< /name></record></dataset><record>

Mr. Fong's is my gold standard for this type and price range of Chinese food and dining environment. I haven't found a comparable place in this area as of yet. This place isn't cheap chinese food, but more of a medium ground for pricing, and the food is outstanding for its price. We ordered four dishes/plates and the total came out to be $55 before tax and tip. Service is average and acceptable for this type of restaurant. They seat you, take your order, bring your food, and then your check when you're done eating. Nothing fancy and nothing that's missing for what you're paying for. There's also take out, which is a very popular choice. I have not ordered anything that didn't meet or exceed expectations (except one day out of countless visits). Portions are larger than expected. Highly recommended and a must try if you're in the area.</Review>

Check your orders, they charge you for a product but don't give you all of your order. Check your whole ducks. Check your whole chickens. You wont get all of it because they take chunks out for other customers.</Text>

I Love Mr. Fong's but "expletive delete" man $40 bucks for lunch is too much!  Asked about a lunch menu and somehow (cough) ended up with screw the pooch family style portions.  Guys like me get stuck like this all the time unless I make an argument of it.

Wasn't a clean table in the place when I popped in after lunch rush which was about two.  Waitstaff was obviously worn out and off their game from not only my own misgivings and problems too small to mention but the solid complaints I couldn't help overhearing from the other two covers.  Awkwaaaard.

All the same, food's a real treat here.  Everything with the food was really good.  Loved it.

Spicy garlic wings, fried rice, hot and sour soup lunch (with an egg rolI which I didn't get here) is just about a ten buck lunch anywhere else.

Food gets five stars with the overall review anchored down by everything else.<//Text>

Great for pork and duck. Average on the rest and below average on cleaninness although this is what I see as the usual standard for Chinese butcher/restaurant. (yeah, it's both)< /review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>This is exactly what you’d expect from an Asian BBQ joint. If you know what to expect, then you’re good to go. If it’s your first time, here are some notes.

Definitely not the cleanest restaurant. Waiters/waitresses may not be the kindest and sometimes it’ll be hard to get their attention. Just be assertive. I wouldn’t use the bathroom. It’s kind of gross. It’ll help if you can speak Chinese, but if you point at stuff, that’ll suffice.

On the other hand, Chinese BBQ is done right here. I’ve had BBQ pork so many times I can’t even count. I will recommend all their rice plates. They are priced well and will definitely fill you up. Or just order a plate of BBQ Pork. That’ll work too. Their fried chicken is also bomb along with the fried string beans.

The noodles aren’t bad either. Good portions and will definitely keep you warm and full on a cold day in Daly City.

Overall, definitely recommend as a spot for some seriously down to earth Chinese BBQ.

Pro tip: become a regular and they’ll definitely increase your portions ;)<//Text><Time>1557632066652</Time><user_name>Norman Su</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Line for ordering and line for duck n pork are separated but nobody tells you and theres no sign. Server are bumping into you while in line, you are lucky if you hear excuse me. Small n busy place. Food is good. Price not cheap and not expensive. Cashier allowed multiple people to cut in front of me. I was ordering to go. Very bad experienced 3 times I've been here.</Review>

Food was terrible and the service was even worse. I took 2 bites from my food and when i let the waitress know that my food was not pleasing me, she accused me odd lying. Wait it gets even messier....she never once tried to offer me anything else to appease me. I still paid and she had the gaul to ask why didn't i tip. Never again.< /Review>

<text>Just looking at the roast duck, chicken and pork ribs hanging inside the store front is a cue this is a restaurant specialize in Chinese deli meat and they sell a ton.  It's convenient to take the cha siu aka roast pork to go, but I like eating it there because they serve the meat with fresh hot rice and vegetables aka rice plates.  The chow fun rice noodles and won ton soup is also very delicious.  Neighborhood favorite that I frequent.< /text>< user_id>

<review>Best tip:  eat in if you can, because portions of noodle and rice dishes tend to be a bit more and the salt & pepper pork chops don't get soggy.

Great Hong Kong style BBQ joint with delicious, generous portions of Cantonese style soup and stir fried noodles and rice plates made to order that most families will enjoy at a fair price.  You know it's legit when you can look into the kitchen from where you order takeout and you can see rows of whole ducks hanging, ready to be roasted.  The small dining room with tables parked very close to each other is usually packed, so be patient.  Parking can be challenging because the lot is shared with Manila Market, a bowling alley and a larger popular dim sum/seafood restaurant which holds weekend banquets.<//review>< Resp>

Good portions at a fair price. They have a very expansive menu as well. The decor is down and out and service sucks but, they make it up with their food. Parking can be tuff at times too since there’s a grocery store, bowling alley, and various other stores in the same lot.<//Text>

Place looks dirty. BBQ pork was nothing compared to ones you can get in San Francisco. This was supposed to be great according to others but maybe I'm used to quality food.</review>

If you like Chinese style roast duck, this place is the one. 5 out of 5 picky old immigrant ladies and 4 out of 4 discerning lo fan neighbors agree this spot has the bomb diggity duck.  As in, this year it supplanted a spot on Stockton St. in Chinatown that was the favorite for the last 5 years.  And yes, there are differences, since it's all about a chef's technique.

Remember that you have to specify whether you like it fatty or lean, like most Chinese bbq delis.<//Text>

If you donate, it may say something like it could not be processed. But in reality it IS. I experienced this and tried a second time with same reslts. When i checked my bank it turns out i was  debited Twice. I don't mind giving a donation at all, but i don,t want to be dinged for two donations . It's not the amount of money, but if you don't have a ton of money in the bank, you may end up bouncing a check somewhere if you don't keep track< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x809cb5c90e4a1003:0xe54c6d152659fbd7< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

It does alot for the community.  But it needs alot from the city. Much help needed. Good place to go if you need food and a shower and supplies and shelter.  But the city needs to step up and help them get the place up to date .< /Text>

If your truly homeless and don't want to be anymore, need a change of pace, or help making changes in your life this is a good place to start. No drugs of any kind. Even cannabis. But if u need a roof over your head and have the drive to get off the streets. They're there to help.</review>

The mission has saved my life. They gave me an oppurtunity to get off the streets and get sober. Three square meals a day and if u show up late or to early they make sure u get something to eat. If u wish to learn about God u can but its not shoved down your throat either. The guys and girls that help guide people here arent perfect and make mistakes but hold each other accountable are a true example of wut a christian should b. I thank God daily to live here and learn through them Gods will in my life.<//review>

This place saves lives. You aren't required to believe and they do so very much and don't ask more than you be a human being with decency, manners and humility. So I guess the naysayers aren't human.<//Text>

Great people everyone is pretty nice, but the owners do not take care of there people that well. They do a lot to help the community, they also have church services every night witch if u believe in God then it's great, if u do not not so great. They have wounderful food a great cook. All in all it's a great place. I miss everyone there. Pastor steve and miss anny r very great people. And I thank them very much for providing a great place for me to stay.</text>

The people here are so friendly and helpful and I my tax professional is knowledgeable and very helpful. I have been coming to this same location (Gardena, CA) for the past sixteen years.  I continue because the prices are reasonable and the tax professionals keep up with the current tax changes.</review>

I will return as long as Sara Mareno is my tax preparer. She's an amazing person and she knows what she's doing. Every person that walks out of her cubicle leaves a positive compliment. She puts a smile on the customers face from the time they walked in till the end. I love her positive personality. She's very professional, intelligent, funny, sweet  and just overall amazing employee. Thank you Sara Moreno!</text>

Poor customer service, They kept calling me to go file my taxes with them reminding me and after I did I had questions and I kept calling them they ignored all my calls put me on hold said the agent wasn't available or was busy I requested to speak to a supervisor several times with no luck they also mess up on my return .<//review>

<Review>The tax professionals at the Gardena HR Block are Top notch!
I am a uber driver and earned a lot last year. was very worried about
filing a return for the 1st time having 1099K. but the office manager Tony
made me feel very good about the level of professionalism in the gardena
location. I now agree and have told all my friend to go to this location.
The Tax pro Maria was very good about Explaining the hows and whys
of the entire process. also my friend saw Linda and Beverly!
I am very Happy and will be a loyal client from now on!<//Review>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Text>On 2/21/17 I called the Gardena office of H&R Block and made an appointment to see "Beverly" the next day at 10 a.m. I arrived at the office at 9:55 and was told by "Tony" at the reception desk that Beverly was with another client and would "be right with me". After sitting in the waiting area for 20 minutes,Tony went to check on Beverly and reported again that she would "be right with me". I waited another 20 minutes, after which I walked out and made an appointment with Jackson Hewitt. If Tony would have been up front with me about the 40 minute (or longer) wait, I would have rescheduled. Consigning me to "be right with you" purgatory was unprofessional and inconsiderate, I lost an hour of a very busy day.<//Text>< gmap_id>

I hadn't been here for years.
Great service & the wood selection, while a bit higher in price, was very good quality. And save me time being the 5 cities.
Bad quality wood makes me have to start over and That's serious $.
Beware when walking thru the store area!
You'll find all kinds of project pieces & ideas interesting, that were never on your To Do List to begin with.
I'll be back 😊< /review>

This is a fantastic hardware store and lumber mill!  It is a small town business but does work all over the large San Luis Obispo County and beyond!  I highly recommend this business for all of your home and business building needs!  Also, check out their other business in the village of Arroyo Grande for your gift and home decorating needs.< /review>

Forget the box stores ,a lumber mill old school style, a glass shop a true hardware store
With items that are hard to find it's been there since the beginning of the time a family-run business it's great!!<//review>

<text>I had walked through the store putting about $500 worth of products in my cart get to the check out when this man claiming it was his store came up to me and my husband and said we needed to leave the store he was not gonna sell us anything. We asked y and he refused to give a reason. And after we told him we just got our settlement money and had $10,000 in our account he proceeded to call the cops on us. And at that point I called my account on speakerphone proving my balence and proved balence he was stillrude and judgemental and proceeded to have some one fallow us out side as we walked to nail salon and then he sent cops to harass and embarrass us there... The cops ran our names and we proved our balence the cops laughed and left..its sad and wrong how judgemental people can be.very poor customer service<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80ec5e95a94b5a87:0xfeda07ee129bbcd1< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Ian Dani Souza< /Name><response>None</response><Text>The bedroom window glass broke in my duplex. It is single pane. I called Arroyo Grande Glass. They said they had no employee in that could help me, and even if they did, I wouldn't get done today. Referred me to Brisco's. I have been there many times, but didn't know they repaired window glass. I went there around 10 am and it was done by 12pm. Great service. Super nice. Very helpful. Glad I could get it back the same day. Especially since it has been raining. Glad this business is around with it's old time values and services. I hope they never go out of business. Lets help support these small businesses with great values, service, and helpfulness.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

I really used to enjoy coming over here to get my family and I a good boba smoothie but man have they gotten expensive! They've raised the prices enormously it's insane. It's more than a gallon of gas. $3.49 for a regular size and I paid almost $6 for a stinkin' large which wasn't even as large as the other places I've gone to. They tack on more for extras as well. Bring cash if not they'll tack on another fee! Card fees! Ridiculous.

I'm never coming here again. I'd rather wait to get my boba fix when I'm down south. Seems like when something becomes popular here in town the business owners thinks it's okay to rip customer's off. You know if you want to keep your customers happy this is not one of them. They just lost my families business. They're not even the greatest boba cafe in town anyways. They don't even have a wide variety of flavors. In San Diego boba cafes they have a plethora of flavors. It's a good thing I know another place to get some good boba and not for the cost of gas prices here in Bakersfield.

We've tried the food as well and I would pay there prices at all anymore. We just mainly came for boba drinks.</Text>

Food was not the best, there is no option to substitute any of the meats you don't like. They have chicken and ribs teriyaki, but No beef teriyaki, which is rare that this happens in restaurants.
The Boba drinks taste better than the food, I guess.</Review>

Although their food was good and I would probably give them a 4.5 or 5 it's just you have to spend $10 and they charge you $0.50 they Knick knack you to death. When it was managed by the other owners it was a hell of a lot better. I spent $40 in food I feel like I got $15 worth of food.<//review>

Been here many times for hot wings and I love coming back when I can as House of Wings has the best wings I've tried in all of Bakersfield, and I've tried a lot of different places. Owner and staff are very kind and friendly. Of course they don't only sell hot wings, they have a variety of things on their menu and everything I've tried have all been great. I love getting hot wings along with curly fries to eat with my family.</Text>

I truly love this place! The meat is always tender yet well cooked. Flavors are great!I like the lemon pepper wings. In 20 minutes your meal is usually done. So I call ahead if I'm going to pick up or I dine in when I'm on a time limit. Did I say this place is great!!!</text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>This place has been on my radar for quite a while but I never pulled the trigger because I’m pretty loyal to my usual favorite wing spot in town. But one day I had some time free after a photoshoot so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered a ten-piece lemon pepper because let’s be honest… lemon pepper is the only flavor that matters. The wings were A-MAZING!! Hot, fresh, a good size, perfectly fried with the perfect amount of lemon-pepper. Could this be my new favorite wing spot? Well not so fast… I like to give a new place at least three chance before I proclaim anything because anyone can have a good day and anyone can have a bad day, hits and misses happen everywhere.

The second time I went there I got a twenty-piece. Now… the wings were good BUT they didn’t have that same magic as the first time and they were also a little undercooked. Not by a lot, but a self proclaimed wing connoisseur like myself can tell. See what I mean about the “hit and miss?” So I went back a third time and this time I got a meal. I believe it was the five piece with the fries and drink. Now here’s where this place rubbed me the wrong way. Each of the two other times I was helped by a younger women and I was just charged my meal. This time it was an older woman and she told me that if I wanted to use my credit card I would be charged .50. I work for an indie mom & pop store in town so I understand WHY the CC charge, but either they charged me that free the first two times and didn’t say anything… OR they pick and choose which customers they charge the .50 fee. And I didn’t see that posted anywhere (yeah, I looked)

This is the type of inconsistency with businesses that drive me crazy. Admittedly I’m hyper-sensitive about this because of… certain reasons. But if you’re going to charge a CC fee then 1. Make it public and 2. Make sure all your employees do this. Otherwise it seems random and unfair. Three visits all within ten days. And even though I LOVE their wings, I haven’t been back because of this. If I do go back I’ll bring cash just so I don’t have to bring this up and cause an awkward situation.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80ea6aa89fdc6845:0x900a0b04fbcfb8f1< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Antonio Hernandez</user_name><review>I was on Panama wanting a smoothie before I headed back home to Arvin, I stumbled upon this place by accident and didn't expect much. I literally just enjoy drinking something while I'm driving longer distances. I ordered a Thai tea smoothie with boba, and as I walked out and took my first sip, I was amazed! The smoothie was amazing! My only complaint was the drink almost looking like ice cream rather than a smoothie. It was a little under blended, as halfway through the drink, I started noticing chunks of ice come out through the straw, but I was just so amazed by the taste that I didn't really care.<//review></record>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>It's a very good casual, modern Korean style restaurant, and I highly recommend it for non-Koreans. However, food (particularly the bbq plates) is too salty, service slow, and portion doesn't justify the 14 dollar price tag.<//review><username>Isaac Kim< /username>< gmapID>

<Text>I had milk tea boba and it was terrible. Boba had a bad texture and the tea was not great either. I am spoiled in LA with world class boba shops, but just wanted to let the world know that this wasn't one of them. Also, the price was 4.01. I couldn't use my credit card without a 50 cent fee and there was no penny bin. I asked if she could just ignore the penny, but she didn't answer and proceeded to give me 99 cents change. That's the price, so fine, but who sets their price of one of the two items in their freakin Name to be 4.01, and then discourages use of credit cards?</Text>< resp>

<Text>Hands down my favorite Thai food in Sacramento. Best apps, Khao soi veggie/tofu (which they are happy to accommodate) is spot on, and all the curries are outstanding! Great beer selection and prices with the friendliest service makes this our go to every time- even though there are other spots closer to home ;)</Text></record>

<review>I can't say enough about this place. The best Thai food in the Sacramento area in my opinion...the workers are so over the top and friendly, the curry is always on point, and the green tea ice cream...man oh man some of my favorite ice cream to indulge in!</review>< Pics>

The place is good, and their service too.I ordered shrimp pad thai , and the spice level i choose was HOT 🔥 , i am an Indian and we are famous for eating spicy food, so i thought i can manage it , they also warned me its gonna be very spicy. As i was warned it was very spicy , couldn't eat at all even though it was so tasty. So please select Medium spicy 😁< /Text>

Food was really good I went for dine-in since indoors were closed due to Covid(which is good) I had to dine outdoors and there’s lot of dust as it’s right next to the street and for that I do not recommend dine-in until they open indoor..Other than that this place is clean, service is good and food is great</text>

<review>thai fried rice was super good, green curry was little watery(supposed to be creamy) and has mild flavor. Sticky mango was good but mango was pretty hard.</review>< Pics>

Got to know about this place from my friends and I thought will give it a try.
I have been to this restaurant more often than once a month over the past one year. One of the best Thai food in downtown and probably tops the list in the Sacramento area.
The food tastes authentic and the service is neat. spacious enough place for a team lunch. Gets really busy in the weekdays with about 20mins waiting time.
I have taken a few friends here and all of them love this place.
We always ask for food to be hot and its really spicy hot.
Must trys- Red curry, All sea food fried rice, pad thai, Thai tea.< /review>

I celebrated my PhD this evening in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that it was a pleasant evening and the place was clearly the reason for that fruitful evening. The crew  participated in a gorgeous style, the cuisine was delicious and my buddies were very  glad. We shall surely come back again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.<//review>

My favorite Thai restaurant in Sacramento! I appreciate that if you order vegetarian curry they include zucchini, cauliflower, and broccoli with the normal potato and carrot. I always get yellow curry with veggies and soft tofu, and it's perfect every time. Staff is always friendly too!</Text>

<Text>I went here for lunch with some co-workers last week (my second visit to this place). Unfortunately, three of the four of us came down with food poisoning that evening. They are also unwilling to ever split checks, and the food is on the pricy side. The good news is that the food tastes great. Still, I don't think I'll every be back.

Good place to come for Thai food. Had the chicken drunken noodle and pineapple curry and both dishes are definite recommendations. For their spice level, if you like the kick then order hot. If you like just a little bit of kick order mild. For those that just like fire in your mouth then go with the extra hot and you'll be burning.<//Text>

Nice Thai restaurant with good food. I liked my Pad Thai with pork. The staff was friendly,  the service quick,  and the restaurant clean. They also included a soup with our lunch. Last, their prices were reasonably,  especially their lunch prices.  I would go back.< /review>

I've come to appreciate the greatness of Sawasdee the more that I travel the world.  Every dish is filled with flavors that are hard to find anywhere.  Even the a common dish like the Pad Thai, is beyond exceptional.  The service is always perfect, and I recommend picking a curry dish if you dine here.  Portion sizes are worth the price.<//Review>

<Review>We walked in here on a whim on Saturday night. It seemed popular and was pretty busy, so we were lucky to get a table.

We had the fresh spring rolls, red curry, and pad se ew. The spring rolls were light and refreshing, and my pad se ew was some of the best I've ever had--very flavourful with tender noodles and chewy tofu.

The space was well laid out with thoughtful decor. We'd definitely come back again.<//Review>< Pictures>

I had the Crab Pad Thai as well as let me tell you, this was THE BEST PAD THAI I have ever before had in my life!! I am not even overemphasizing. I do not even believe I have actually even come across a menu that has crab as a meat choice for pad thai. As odd as that seems, some pad thai noodles are usually still hard\/raw as well as very difficult to separate, however this was best.< /review>

Great food and great service. I was really impressed with the pat Thai, the service was super awesome and after checkin in I received my free thai tea.

The spicy levels were in increments of 1/10 which was kinda surprising but super helpful. 3 = mild and I agreed.

Over really happy</text>

<text>The Drunken Noodles and Pra Ram are delicious and ridiculously affordable. I can't find another restaurant in the area that can compete with their quality and pricing.

Plus they can bring the heat. Ask for the spice tray, and try the little peppers. They've got a fire and flavor I haven't found anywhere else.</text>< gmapID>

<Review>My favorite Thai place in Sacramento! It's cheap, fast and the service is great. They have specials constantly, but you are never going to pay more than $10 - $15 for a dish. In the summertime they unroll their "garage door" and the restaurant takes on more of an open air feel. It's a great date night in the summertime if you want to split a bottle of white wine with a friend and grab some salmon curry.< /Review>< date>

As most of the thai restaurant, it's a good place to share food with a group of people. Avocado green curry, crab meat pad thai are beyond expectation! We got a 130 bill with 8 people so I would say it's fairly cheap ;)<//review>

I wish I could give this place more stars. The service was  excellent and friendly and  the food was out quick, but the food  just isn't in the same league as Thai Canteen.  Its not  bad food, but there are simply better options.< /review>

<Time>1482249521935<//Time><text>Terrifically presented food that taste good, but is served in a very sterile environment.

The Thai Steak Sirloin was terrific, tender, and served with a wonderfully flavorful sauce. But the noodles inside the Spring rolls were extra soft, leading to an unexpected squishiness within the otherwise crispy assortment of fresh vegetables. The Salmon Curry was nice, but not spectacular.

The environment unfortunately feels like the empty shell of a former auto service garage. Sparse and with great large windows that afford a terrific view outside, but unfortunately do little to prevent outside heat or cold from easily messing with the inside environment.<//text><Name>Jansen Wendlandt< /Name><rating>3< /rating><Gmap_id>0x809ad0dae1b2528f:0x7fbbed2dfddd942<//Gmap_id><UserId.>103177322018784593796< /UserId.>< Resp>

Wonderful food and slow service. This place was unexpectedly busy at be 2PM and they appeared under staged for it but the food was excellent and the service was good when it happened on its own time. We had the duck curry and pad Bangkok which were both excellent choices. I'm looking forward to coming back here hopefully when not quite so busy.<//Text>

< review>
This location scented so a lot like dining establishments in Thailand that it revived a flooding of memories. The fish sauce, the fermented shrimp paste, and also jasmine rice.Service was so on the round as well as they maintained examining on me every couple of minutes waiting on me to buy. Food appeared in a timely style, as well as had a great deal of leftovers so they boxed it up for me.From the Thai cold tea, to the Tom kha gai (coconut chicken soup), to the Bangkok sausages which were so complete of fresh lemongrass, as well as the Khao soi contained taste as well as had the perfect thickness as well as depth of flavor.Was too full for dessert and also loved all the meal, no complaints at all.For sure will certainly be back!< /review>

I've been here a few times now. They have dine in and carryout. It's not the best Thai food, but if you know what to get then that's satisfactory. Portions are well sized for the price. Parking may be an issue depending on the time and day because they're located on a busy corner.<//Review>

Really love this place! The interior has a cool vibe without being pretentious, and I can say the same about the staff, as well -- super helpful and friendly. We got the pumpkin shrimp curry, basil pork belly, drunken noodles and thai spring rolls. The ingredients were super fresh, everything was very flavorful and really generous portions. Can't wait to explore everything on the menu as they offer more variety than other nearby Thai restaurants</Text>

This was a good Thai restaurant. I had the Panang Curry with Tofu and it was Great!!
While not the 'Best' place in Sacramento, or in Midtown, it's still pretty good; especially when compared to some of the not-so great places.
They are really accommodating for people with dietary restrictions such as Celiac Disease and they had good vegetarian and vegan options as well.
I would definitely recommend!< /review>

<Review>It was cold in there. (I might’ve been sitting under a vent, though.) The lighting was cold & harsh. Good lighting matters.
They brought the spring rolls out like 90 seconds after we ordered them and they were SO GOOD! My Pad See Ew took a little longer and it was DELICIOUS!

Decent food. Not much for atmosphere (former auto body shop?). Efficient Service. Had the Kao Soi (it's great they even have it), and it was good not great. Good broth, so so noodles. There's lots of good Thai nearby so this isn't a must, but decent if you end up there...</review>

Mediocre food at best; better Thai is widely available nearby. Service was terrible; we were served something we didn't order and they wouldn't take it back and charged us for it.<//Text>

My favorite Thai food place is relatively cheap and the food is great. The only drawback is how slow they are. You have to hunt down a waitress and be a little to insistent if you don't want to stay there forever. Don't go for lunch if you don't have at least an hour for eating</Text>

I bought a Groupon for this place and have not been able to use it because the restaurant is never open when it says it is.
First, we stopped by on a Sunday at 10:30. Closed but they had menus on the door saying that they where open 11am- 10pm Daily. OK, so we'll wait a bit and come back when they're open, no biggie.
So I dropped off my car down the street to get detailed and we'll eat while we wait for it to get done. We come back at 11:30 and guess what? Still not open. That's weird because their menu clearly says that they should be open and there is no sign to say otherwise. Odd, so I checked the website... it says they're open 11am to 10pm but they're closed on sundays. We'll that sucks, I guess we'll try again for dinner on Monday since they're open late. 9:05pm monday, here we are for the third time and NOPE not open. Not a single light on. Wtf?
Is this place ever open? Maybe I'll never find out...</text>

My wife and I thoroughly enjoy Thai food and have tried MANY Thai restaurants all over the Sacramento area. Swasdee is the best Thai I've ever had in Sacramento.
We had the Crisp Fried Calamary for starters. I've never seen squid served in this way, but it came to us in what can best be described as "calamari chips".  If they sold this stuff in stores, I'd buy it all.  The tangy plum sauce that comes with the calamari for dipping was delicious.
For the main dish, I ordered the Pad Him-ma-parn (the stir fried Cashew plate). The flavors and spices were amazing, the meat was tender and delicious and portions on the lunch plate were perfect.
My wife had Pad Prik Gang (Pumpkin Stir Fried) with tofu. Tasty tofu can be hard to come by if it's not done properly and this was certainly done with care and love.  The flavor penetrated each part of the meal and eventually every part of the pallette.
To finish things up, we ordered the Fried Banana Ice Cream and were presented with a choice of coconut, taro, vanilla, or green tea ice cream (we opted for Coconut).  The dessert came with four adorable (and delicious) banana filled eggrolls which were drizzled with a creamy sweet sauce. the ice cream was delicious and truly wrapped up the whole experience of our meal nicely.
I'd DEFINATELY revisit and will be recommending this establishment to fans of food everywhere. When I complimented the server on a job well done, I discovered that the restaurant is family owned and ran. Our waitress thanked me, saying that they pride themselves on being able to bring the flavors of their much beloved cuisine to the people of Sacramento.  I can't wait to go back!< /Text>

<Text>Food was very good but a little expensive. It was on Christmas Day so they were very busy. It took more than an hour for my orders to be done. Oh yes,  the serving wasn't as much as we are used to in other Thai registrants.<//Text><Name>Marlene Caballero-Bosque</Name>< rating>

Pretty clean place. Went on a Sunday pretty close to closing time and it was kinda busy. For tattoos you can walk in on a first come first serve basis but for appointments you have to put a $100 dollars deposit. Basic ear piercing is around $30 bucks.<//Review>

<Text>I got my septum pierced here without an appointment and I was in and out very quickly. The piercing came out good but the lady that did it went very fast without warning or any consultation. I would recommend coming here if you’re looking for good, affordable piercings.< /Text><user_name>Aileen Rodriguez</user_name><Time>1615092747083<//Time></record>

I had the rudest piercer, she had so much attitude. To top it off the jewelry she used is on waaaay too tight, it doesn't have the room to swell now and the H2Ocean can they had sold me was broken 💀
Edit: i forgot to mention she didnt even tell me how to clean it after or anything as to how to take care of it or when i can switch it out.<//review>

< Review>
My friends and I found this place last minute because we wanted spur of the moment piercings. We were pleasantly surprised how amazing this place was and how friendly and professional the staff were. To our surprise, the pricing was low-cost and honestly they should be charging a lot more. They were following all covid procedures as well as clean practices when it came to piercings. The place itself is very big, clean and spacious! I am definitely raving about this gem in East LA to all my friends! Shout out to Gordo who was the point of contact when arriving to the shop. He was friendly, funny and amazing. Shout out to Rosa for her professional and clean piercings. She was quick and very knowledgeable!<//Review>

I live at Harbor City we traveled to Brown Pride Tattoo & Piercing. I don't mind traveling. They are professionals, clean place, customers enter the building, unless the customer is a minor. They have a patio were they have an employee take names separate customers 6 ft. until they are call in.  I will come again</Review>

<Review>Hands down, they are the most professional Nail salon I have ever been to. I have been about six times now, and I have never had a complaint to give. They ask you what you want and that is what they give you. They do not try to talk you out of what you want because they do not feel like doing it, or because they want to make more money off of you.

They spoil their customers with the offer of water, soda, or champagne. More times than not, they are passing you some type of a snack. One time I was there to have my self time, and they offered me a glass of champagne, I turned it down because I had not eaten. One of the owners came out with a few snack offers for me to put something on my stomach first. LOL. I thought it was the coolest thing ever!

Lastly, they speak in English around you. I know many people that are always wondering what nail techs are talking about, and sometimes feel like they are being talked about while they're getting their nails done. You will not have to worry about that here. If you do hear them speak in another language, you can tell that it is nothing to question. Deluxe Nails, YOU ALL ROCK!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80900c5a5311a8c1:0x19021c93fcc37f74< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Honestly I liked my pedicure here but when I tried to go in for a full set I already had a set on so I ask them to take it off , instead of soaking it off they ripped my nails off one by one . My pinky was bleeding by the time they were done . Also they waited until the day of my appointment to tell me they didn’t know how to do the design I wanted . Unfortunately I will never go back .</text>

They have multiple pedicures pakages ranging from a basic to a Deluxe
I love how professional they are. There are three TV's,  they're always friendly, laughing & politeto all clients.
Each experience has been excellent. I definitely recommend< /Review>< Pics>

<time>1602835306376</time><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Came in for a full set and pedicure. My toes have one coat of polish and my nails broke more than twice in a weeks span. For $85 I expected my money worth and I’m dissatisfied because I didn’t even have the nails for two weeks like I normally would. After a week and a half I’m now taking them all off because another nail broke. My nails were super thin and they were very stingy with the product. I will not be going back!< /Review>< pics>

I would not recommend this place I only had my nails on for two days and three have broke already. The place is nice and clean but they should Invest in better nail techs that’s more important.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>First time getting my nails done since the longest which was over 10 years ago. I got the gel ones and although I need to get used to them. They came out really nice and during the process it felt like I was  getting pampered. I can't stop admiring my nails. I just need to make them last since I'm not used spending so much because I don't often go out to pamper myself lol.. but do know I will come back to get my nails done. 😊❤<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Signs in front said new ownership.  This is exactly what this place needed. A breath of fresh air.  New owners Duy and Samuel has really brighten this place up.  From updated decor to introducing the newest style of nails.  These guys seems very genuine and always have the biggest smiles on. Prices are very competitive.  Way cheaper than all the near by salons.  I recommend this place to all my family and friends.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80900c5a5311a8c1:0x19021c93fcc37f74< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>Please do not lie and say your under new management when you are not. Your business card and front door should reflect the hours of operation. And if you wish to work when you want to, you should remove the business hours.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Excellent, communicative, friendly customer service and the high standard of cleanliness of Deluxe Nails are unmatched.
Plain and simple, if you are looking for comfortable, clean, and talented nail shop, just come here. Enough said.< /review>

<review>I continue to come back here because the service is so good. No appt needed and the gel pedicures last forever. Also, they are kid friendly. I was able to take my son in his stroller no problem while getting the pedicure! Prices are pretty average.</review><UserId.>110008889750932000148<//UserId.></record>

<Text>I took my mother to get a French manicure about a week ago. They insisted she get the white tip painted so that when she comes in for a fill it will look natural. Well they made sure that her nails would chip easily. Sure enough, 2 days later 1 nail chipped and another, 4 days after. This is my second review so far!</Text><rate>1< /rate>< Gmap_id>

This place is really nice to go to. They have great service, and are really nice. I called only 25 minutes before and made an appointment.  The place does need a little tlc on there furniture.  But the more people they have I know it will improve.<//review>

Didn’t get what I wanted. Asked for color acrylic and she did get what I was saying I guess. She was rushing,cut my finger. Never again. Walmart is way better. And she was texting as she was doing my nails. It was bad she left acrylic chunks that they usually file off.< /Text>

I payed $460 to fix the leak in my power steering. That was a month ago. It's still not fixed. My car sounds horrible now and they keep telling me that it's dry everytime I go back, even though there's obviously a wet spot under the hood. Now they're saying there's an oil leak. Why wasn't I told that in the diagnostic I payed for? My steering is so difficult and it's so dangerous traveling with my kids in the car. These places just love ripping women off. I keep refilling the power steering fluid everyday so I can drive.<//text>

The employees were all very professional and friendly. We were greeted, explained the difference in the oils when I asked, washed my dirty windows, checked tire pressures and make sure all fluids were topped off and showed me my dirty air filter that needed to be changed out. They got me in and out in a timely manner. I will definitely be back!< /Review>

I had previously gotten an oil change at a Jiffy Lube in my hometown of Gardnerville, NV and by the end of the week I noticed I was leaking oil. As I happen to work in Sacramento I took it to their downtown location, they saw no leaking but suggested I take it to the Olson Dr. location because they perform more services than just oil changes. Before bringing it to them I noticed it only seemed to leak oil when my car was idling at an angle, like in my driveway for example. I brought it to this location and the manager Nick helped me. They checked it out, it wasn't leaking for them of course, but he still replaced the filter and told me to come back if there were any problems.  A few days later I filmed it leaking as it was idling in my driveway. I brought it back, Nick helped me again and brought it straight into a bay to have his mechanics check it out. I showed them the video, they did a thorough check of my car and found no defects which could be causing the problem (which was a huge relief), and long story short they installed a different filter, and after a few days of idling it in my driveway and filming it there was no more leaking and the problem was fixed. I can't thank Nick enough for working the problem with courtesy and professionalism, but also for making me feel confident in bringing my car there. Since it started leaking I was stressing and at the end of the day the problem was solved and remains solved thanks to people like Nick. I will definitely not hesitate to bring my car here with any future issues it may have!</text>

I Loved my experience at Jiffy Lube but I ended up spending more money than I expected. Of course that was due to my car needing more work done on it. However, I think Jiffy Lube should offer a discount based on the services we receive. I know they have discounts online but I think if we spend over a certain amount then a discount should automatically be offered. That would make the service exceptional!<//text>

I just checked with the Regional Manager on your claims, and we could have certainly told you we perform that service when you called, but then when you showed up and we entered your vehicle into our system, your Ford vehicle stated it does not need a transmission filter change under 150K. I checked all-data and the NHTSA VIN report for your vehicle, it stated the same. Would you like to meet our Regional Manager at the location next week to show him your owners manual that states the service to be performed at 60K miles? We can look to remedy the matter for you, please send me an email directly and I can set it up for you. My email is: mattg @ jiffylubeca.com (no spaces in the email address).

Today I had to take my Truck to Rancho Cordova as my Calipers were sticking and had eaten the Front Rotors badly. The original work was performed in Folsom but they did not have the "Brake Tech" to perform this warranty work. It was discovered from my appointment this am that when the new calipers & brakes were installed in July 2020 that the "Brake Tech" had installed them incorrectly, and so thankfully the people at Rancho Cordova identified and corrected this matter with the replacement of both front rotors & pads. I cant thank Jiffy Lube Rancho Cordova enough for resolving this, but I am very annoyed that I spent over $1,600 in 2020 with Jiffy Lube,  only to find that the "Tech" incorrectly installed the pads & Rotors. This was  a waste of my day and a major inconvenience.</Review>

<review>Did great on oil change.  But jiffy lube doesn’t seem to know the correct tire rotate procedure by manufacture.  They rotated wrong and did not reset the tire inflation system.   So no my front is back and back is front.  This is a safety system and their answer was it will correct with driving.  Last time I drove 6000 miles and it never corrected.  Had to go back and make them do the code tool.  Not sure why this is not a step on their automated process<//review>< username>

<review>UPDATE - I received a call from Jiffy Lube customer service shortly after I submitted my review.  Offered an apology and issued me a refund check. This was unexpected and appreciated...I will still continue to use Jiffy Lube services.

INITIAL REVIEW -
Did not properly attach skid plate at the Northgate location, damage to the plate .Once I realized the plate was dragging on the roadway, I took my car to the closet location which was on Ranch Cordova. I had to take my car back twice to get the plate installed correctly.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1605640601171, 'text': "Thanks for the review Donte we really appreciate your feedback and business during these difficult times.

Went in before work because I needed an oil change and my check engine light had just come on. They changed my oil, scanned my car for free and quickly let me know what was going on. I was not pressured into purchasing anything, and gave me the possible solution which was to change my air filter. They quickly swapped my filter out, reset my light and I was on my way. Thanks again!</text>

<text>I called this morning Sunday Sep.27.2020 to ask for a price to get a oil change. The employee was insisting that I get a higher grade oil. He explained the difference between the oil and still insisted on using the more expensive oil. I told that I wanted to keep the same oil I have been using for 6 yrs. He then became very pushy and kept re-interating why I should get the oil ,whats going to happen to my car etc. He was talking loud and very fast. I told him all of that is fine I want to use what Ive been using. He refused to stop talkin and continued to be pushy;he wouldnt take no for an answer . I then asked for the manager he said he was the manager and hung up on me. I then called back to ask for the owners contact information and he said he doesnt give that out. I asked for his name he refused to give it to me. He was talking very unprofessional and rude. Then he changed and said he doesnt no the owners info. I guess to retaliate for me not going with his choice of oil he then said he was denying my service. How rude. I've never dealt with such disrespect over me choosing what oil I want to put in my car that Im paying for. The experience was unpleasant and unproffesional. God knows after the rude customer service I wouldnt trust him to touch my car.</text><user_name>Denise Austin</user_name>< user>

I work for a fairly large corporation and I brought in my fleet vehicle to have it serviced for the first time. Now if you drive a company vehicle you probably know having to deal with fleet and the company doing the work is usually a pain in the butt the first time. I've never had a good  painless experience doing this until TODAY! I will definitely be back and will recommend the same to my coworkers.< /review>

<Review>I went in for a tire swap and we ran into some troubles with a valve stem that broke due to previous botched maintenance at a different garage. It was a Sunday during memorial day weekend. The team was outstanding resolving the issue even though it took hours. It’s often in difficult situations that people reveal themselves and despite the frustration and the pressure of solving the issue before closing time, the employees really displayed what qualifies as the Gold Standard. Huge kuddos to Hunter for his professionalism and his commitment to get things right. I also appreciated that the repairs came at no cost even though it was someone else fault. I’ll definitely come back.< /Review>< pics>

They checked the air in all my tires to make sure they were at the correct pressure, washed my windshield, checked the windshield fluid and filled it. They were very courtious and friendly.</review>

Jiffy Lube is a great plaće to get your oil checked your vehicle vaccumed and windows cleaned along with getting your tires pressured. Jiffy Lube is also a great plaće to work for and the Boss here on Zinfandale is awesome. However, I now live in Idaho but miss it back home.</text>

<Text>First time as was here had several customers waiting reasonable wait however when had service done several people working on my Truck after service went straight home and park the truck inside my garage epoxy floor. After several days I used my truck for work after a 40 mile drive went home saw on the epoxy garage floor a puddle of oil drippings. Check my engine saw oil all over the engine and several of hoses and I Became worried due to the fact leaking oil and drove truck 40 miles. I called Jiffy Lube talk to a young guy who have an arrogant attitude regarding the situation and on top of it kind of gave me a tip like I dont know whats going on. My truck is older than he his and talking to me like I was born yesterday. I brought it back on a different day and talk to guy name Fermin which treated me better. Told me that those guys mess up on the most basic cleaning procedure. Lousy job stated by Fermin and should have been a better service. I would drive to a different Jiffy Lube for the same service unless I deal with Fermin instead.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>E.T.A. 2:45pm on Wednesday: Place was virtually empty except for one other who was about to leave. I advised to do oil & filter ONLY. No windows, No tires, No air filters - to please just get me in & out. Staff was 5-7 younger guys standing around and chatting mostly. Once done, they pulled it outside, left it idling with the driver door open. Anyone could've jumped in and drove away. It sat idling with me at the counter another 10 mins while the guys were chatting and joking with each other. I kind of felt ignored. Still waited for overall 30 mins, then no one walked me to the front to see my oil level at full. Makes me wonder if they really did actually change the oil or if they actually filled it with the Synthetic that I paid for. I just paid and left - I always feel ripped-off at ANY Jiffy Lube because it just doesn't seem like enough value for the money. Then when I'm ignored on top of it, it's salt in the wound. This and previous issues in the past - I'm looking elsewhere for future services. Disgusted with Jiffy Lubes everywhere - they never fail to disappoint.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1581045117120, 'text': 'Thanks Lucid for the review, we really appreciate your feedback and business.

Oil drain plug leaked after each of last two oil changes.  Good news is Jiffy Lube in Rancho Cordova took care of it quickly with great customers service.  Original oil changes were done at Florin Road location in Sacramento, however, so I had to drive twenty minutes to get it fixed at Jiffy Lube location with full service center!<//Text>

She has a new frs less than 112k miles. Engine light has NEVER came on. She has experience and has kept a perfect upkeep with her vehicle. Saddest part is they were nice and professional, but for some reason a woman is always underestimated when it comes down to car problems. It has been known for jiffy lube to mess with peoples car engine lights but never have I experienced this until coincidently not even 10 miles later her light comes on and there is a resistance in her engine when she stops. I really hope they didn’t cause any damage to her car because it will all pin point  back to them if that is the case once she completely gets it looked at. Extremely disappointed.< /review><rating>1<//rating></record>

The upsales are also getting irritating- trying to add on as much as possible to the oil change.
I appreciate knowing if a bulb is out or service is due, but not going over my air filter everytime I'm there, and the zillion questions what else can be added. Give me short list of recommended items and ask ONCE would I like that done today. Otherwise, do the job I asked for when I drove up, and dont leave people waiting nearly an hour for an oil change.</Review>< Time>

< Review>
Sent my wife to get an oil change as I didn't have time to do her car for her.  Was only 50 for a full check up with coupon "oil, coolant, transmission, tire pressure, air filter, etc".  This was all fine but she stated she was there for 15 minutes at most which concerned me I know its fast but it isn't formula 1 and an oil pan doesn't drain that fast.  Checked her oil to find some remnants of old dark oil after she went in.  It's hard to tell how much old oil was left in there but the color didn't match anything close to all new.  Seeing as I've been doing her oil for years I know new oil looks light to amber not dark.  And. I don't attribute the color to simply driving it when there has only been 200 miles since the change.  Other than the oil it looks like they did a good job but 70 dollars before coupon shouldn't get you a dirty change.

Going forward I'll be doing it myself to insure unnecessary wear and tear isn't taking place because of the easiest and most important maintenance.</Review>

Awesome customer service, happy customer!</Review>

<Review>If I could give zero stars I would. This locations’ employees are the worst I’ve ever seen. From foul language to complete and utter lack of courtesy. I was treated so rudely when I showed up just minutes before they closed. aI’d even called ahead and asked if it was ok if I got there just a few minutes before their scheduled closing time and an employee named Hunter told me as long as the bay doors were open they would help me out. Well when I pulled into the open door at 5:55 I was told it was 6:03. I explained that I’d just spoke with their employee and he said that if he doors were still open I’d be serviced. The employee said oh well, and pulled the chain to close the bay door almost on the front bumper of my vehicle. If I ever heard any of my employees speak like that to a client, I’d fire them on the spot!
I’ve taken all my vehicles to JiffyLube for their scheduled services since 1999, but after today?...I will never do business at any location ever again. You’ve lost a life long customer due to the disrespectful, lazy culture you’ve instilled in your employees. You need us more than we need you.....Bye Felicia!<//Review>< Resp>

<review>Fast & efficient, when there's not a line.  They offer tires which I bought without warranty and one ended up constantly leaking on me and then went flat, and they didn't care because I didn't get the warranty.  It was faulty to begin with but they didn't believe me.

This place is an extended Jiffy Lube because of the other building where they do tires, wheels, and whatever else they do there.<//review></record>

<text>Pulled in and was told 25 minute wait.  45 minutes later after watching three cars go through another bay while our truck sat unmoved we asked about it. Was told we would be on road in 15 minutes.  45 more minutes pass and we finally get called. We question the tire rotation we asked for as they did not say anything about our brake pads...guy starts stuttering grasping for words and spouts off random numbers saying "I'm the one who did it"  Yeah we don't think it was done.  Horrible exterior cleaning as they said (windows were not washed) and didn't bother to lift up floor mats to vaccum under them.  I understand that is really hard to do... backseat no vaccum at all.  Won't be visiting Jiffy Lube any time soon again.
Guy who told us 25 minutes from the start was no where to be seen when we left.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Did a lousy job. Was supposed to have my coolant topped off and of course they didn't do it. Was one dry when I looked at it. Worst part is they took my car out and never showed me the work that they did. Just shut the hood and wanted their money. This jiffy lube sucks and needs better service.< /Review>

I like coming here the team remembers me when I come back, friendly staff. The wait is a little longer than most Jiffy Lube locations but I will be back to this location because of the services and environment that they provide for me and my vehicle.< /text>

I have been their customer for a while, but over the last two trips, customer services has been horrible. After handing off the keys to mechanic, I was told that someone in office will write up the estimate, and I can head back to work while they work on my car. I called up a co-worker to pick me up, and I waited 25 minutes in their office and no one called me up. I started noticing that they were already helping customers who came in after me. So, I walked up to the counter, and I was then surprised again by one of their employees who told me that I need to wait for my turn. At that point, I just had enough, I wasted a total of 40 minutes and didn't even get a simple oil change done. They have definitely lost a customer.< /Text>

My rig has 9000 miles on it (4 cyl) Went in for basic oil change. Don't need rotation-new tires. I needed a cabin filter and they wanted 20.00 (went to Orieleys and bought one for ten dollars before my GI discount and it took me 10 minutes to replace it. So I wanted oil-filter ONLY. I figured $21.00 plus tax ect. The jerk at the  register nailed me for fifty one dollars!! Obviously  the jackass is on commission!21.00labor!< /review>

I was at this place for almost two hours.  It took them more than 30 mins to just change a headlight on a Prius. I get into my car to find this piece of something and the tech says oh yeah that's a part to you glove box that was broken already.  Hmm I didn't drive in with that part rolling around on my floor.  Just a joke! Not to mention no one at this shop are wearing gloves. So they are touching my car with black greasy hands like to big deal. Who does that!  This shop should get a minus star.< /Text>

< Review>
They tried to tell me I needed a new steering rack and pinion. They quoted me $336.00 for the part alone when in reality you can get it new for $150 - $200. Then they tried to charge me $420.00 for labor on it and $225.00 to fix a valve cover gasket. Overall they quoted me over a $1000 in parts I didn't need. So I turned around went to a friend who works on Hondas got the valve cover and labor done for $40 in about 30 mins. Do not go here.<//Review>

<text>I went there and wanted a oil change, but the idiot mechanic Kameron F. was on the lower bay didn't put the drain bolt after the oil change.  I gotten home and there were oil leaking on my curb side of my house and work.  I decided to make copies and scanned the receipt to give it Sacramento Jiffy Lube Human Resource and Joe K. Director of Jiffy Lube which he didn't give a damn much.  Joe K. told to take it back to Jiffy Lube and I decided to take it back to a Hyundai Dealer instead so that i can get an "unbiased" opinion so that Jiffy Lube doesn't cover their mechanics ass and say we didn't or it was like that when you brought it in.  Hyundai Dealer service adviser and mechanics saw and wrote on work order of what they say and it read "inspect for oil leak after oil change at Jiffy Lube. Found out to be a loose drain bolt. Re-tighten and clean any oil residue complete." Hyundai Dealer was so spot on for discovering that as result and they say I did the right thing of bringing it to them, cause if I would brought my car Jiffy Lube they would of made up some bullcrap excuses and cover their branch location and mechanics ass.  Listen to all of you people if you see something like this take it to a dealer first and get "unbiased" opinion so that they can right it on the work order as proof and then take it back to the place that screwed you over as proof.  Watch for this location they had 2 times screw up.  Give it to the manager to do the job instead so that you know who you can point the finger and not some stupid idiots mechanics who graduated from mechanic reform school (Universal Technical School).  The amazing thing was the Assistant Mgr Jeffrey S. was on the upper bay that should of take a look at Kameron's work but didn't.  If these are the kind of people that don't care who to take care of customer (peoples) car then they should and go back to school or find another job of employment.  Remember, Jiffy Lube these are private property personal car and you can be liable under the BAR (Bureau of Automotive Repairs) for some and/or all repairs if they take it to another dealers, or pay the consequence in court as simple as that or people will put a lien on the property.  If yo'u dont like that, then go get better mechanics and/or start being taking care of people care just like it was your.  Jiffy Lube if somebody did that to your care you wouldn't like that either and probably take it somewhere else.  So start doing your job and stop with the F-ups...stay tuned for the Hyundai Dealer paperwork to be uploaded for proof<//text><gmapID>0x809add1484f4724b:0xb70b8b1c98b9792f<//gmapID><Name>DC Wayne< /Name><rate>1</rate><response>None</response></record>

A longer wait than normal on this visit,  but the service was fine,  and my oil was changed.  The extra up purchase sells are ever present,  but it's easy enough to pass.<//review>

Maybe they were too busy. Took over 50 mins to change oil, had time to visit Sensei sushi across the street. They try to upsell all the time. They took out my air filter and did not put the cover back correctly.</Review>

<review>I called Ryan a couple times for repair work a few years ago and I was impressed with his quick response and no nonsense approach. We just had him install a new system. Again he was great to work with. No attempt to upsell us. Also the installation went great - Joshua and the crew were a pleasure to work with. The improvement in airflow and cooling especially is nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend 5 Star!< /review><username>Roger Hahn</username><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

< Review>
I kind of think of 5 Star Heating and Air Conditioning as your consultant first of all.  They will come in and tell you how a good system is designed, how your system can improve better with small changes, and then if needed discuss any major changes you might need.  I felt like their primary goal was that I got an efficient, cost-effective AC system first and foremost.  I'd strongly recommend.  One of the best experiences I've had with this kind of service.<//Review>

Ryan came out ahead of schedule for some routine maintenance on the A/C units. He explained that we have a small leak and what our options were to repair (everything from small options to a full blown replacement of the system).But until we're ready to commit, he simply refilled both tanks and we were back in business. Again, I super appreciate the upfront options and no pressure discussions. We'll continue to use 5 Star Heating!</text>

There are so many predatory HVAC companies out there.  Last fall I fired my HVAC provider of 15 years, Pacific Aire, due to high pressure tactics.  I am so excited to find this company.  They were quick, friendly, efficient and unbelievably helpful.  I now have a new addition to my home maintenance providers.  Thank you Jessica and Ryan.  You get my highest recommendation.</text>

<review>My air conditioning went out and so I called my home warranty company.  They scheduled a company to come out.  When the day came for them to come, they were a no show.  I called 12 different companies.  When I spoke to 5 Star they did not have an available appointment.  So I continued my search.  Later that day i received a call that some appointments had changed and they could fit me in the next morning at 8:00am.  That would have been great yet I had to be back at work for the first day of school the next morning.  I am in education but my position requires me to be on campus for some days even in Covid.  I said thank you but it wouldn't work.  Well that was not a good enough solution for them.  I believe her name is Jessica, then told me that she was going to call other customers and see if they wanted to move their appointment to earlier and i would then take their later appointment once I was back home.  All of that was to me, above and beyond.  I could not thank her enough.  When Ryan, the owner, showed up to diagnose the issue it was a very minor issue.  There was no charge for a repair just the truck fee.  If you are looking for a fair company that goes above and beyond to help you, give these guys a call!!!</review>< Pics>

They were great! Called in the am and they showed up later that same day, which is almost unheard of with ac companies. They gave us an honest solution and didn’t try to sell us on some crazy expensive upgrade for our old furnace. Highly recommend!</Review>

I received excellent service with knowledge about my heater. Ryan was able to fix it after I was told it needed to be replaced and I was quoted a replacement cost that was cost effective and quite a lot lower than the quote I received from another company. My heater is very old and when it does need to be replaced, I will trust Ryan to tell me it’s time and handle the replacement. I am so glad my friend referred me to 5 Star Heating and I would recommend them to anyone who needs heating and air conditioning services.< /Text>

5 Star is the perfect name for this company. I’ve been struggling to get my HVAC working properly for years but every company came up with a different diagnosis of the problem and after a couple of weeks I was back to zero. 5 Star is not the least expensive company but like a 5 Star Hotel you get what you pay for. They found the problem and figured out the solution.  For once, I can finally go to sleep knowing that my bedroom will not be 87 degrees at night during the next heat wave.  Thank you *****< /review>

5 Star installed a new AC / Heating System, they arrived on time, were completely knowledgeable about the installation process and were completely professional while carrying out their work.  I would urge anyone to at least try 5 Star prior to committing to any other Installation company.< /Review>

Ryan has been servicing the HVAC system on all of my properties since 2013. He has installed two full units and has repaired a multitude of air conditioning and heater issues for me since 2013. He is always diligent, punctual and courteous. Ryan is excellent at troubleshooting problems. He is also straightforward and honest. His pricing is always fair too. You can trust Ryan's advice and the work of his technician. 5 Star will continue to be my go-to company for all of my heating and cooling needs.</Text>

< Review>
We have been working with Ryan, and his associates for about 3 years now. He's awesome. All of 5 Star are. Every time we find ourselves with a problem, I call Ryan, and he comes out if not the same day, then for sure the next day... and usually he makes the same day work.

I always know he's giving us the advice he would follow himself, never trying to gouge us for a more costly job - and I feel like being able to trust someone in these cases is rare these days. We have used Ryan for small repair jobs, and also larger jobs in our home, taking multiple days, and he is ALWAYS professional, courteous, and gets the job done well.

I cannot recommend him enough. I really wish every person we called on could be as good as Ryan, and the rest of the 5 Star crew.<//Review>

<text>About a month ago, my mom's heater quit. Ryan at 5 Star fixed it but warned me that a major part may need to be replaced if it quit again. It worked for several weeks and then quit. I was concerned because she is 90 and lives alone. I called Ryan  and he went out that morning and replaced the part. He also deducted the labor charge I had paid the first time he came out. Very reliable and fair and he does excellent work. 5 Star's level of professionalism is a rare and refreshing find in today's world.</text>< Pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Review>First off, an actual person answered their phone when I called. I didn't have to leave a message and hope and wait for a call back as I did with a couple of other companies I tried.

Ryan arrived exactly at the appointment time, there was no "your technician will be there between 1 and 4 pm" stuff. He was friendly and knowledgable. I only had a fuse out which was a relief so he replaced it and then checked the temperature of the air conditioning which was cooling again properly. He also showed me that the grill in front of the vent in my bedroom was funneling the cool air right out the bedroom door. He got on a step-stool and used a needle-nosed plier to change the direction of the grill's slats so that the air would funnel into the room instead of out the door.

I am very pleased with the overall service of the company and Ryan was great.< /Review>< Pictures>

My visit to Family Eye Care was an exceptional experience. The staff was friendly, kind, supportive, and I felt like they really cared. I was picking out frames and I was able to get the opinion and advice from 3 different staff members to help me make a decision. They all genuinely wanted to help me choose the frames that would be the best for me. The office was clean and the building is beautiful. I can’t wait for my next visit!< /Text>

<Review>Every time I enter Family Eye care I know they will be on time, professional, and friendly. I have been trusting my eyes to Family Eye Care for many years. Dr. Garcia‘s team members will not only make you feel at home they make you feel like you’re a friend. The inventory of eyewear is top-of-the-line. After years of suffering with dry eye, Dr. Garcia finally solved this problem for me with several dry eye treatments. It has made such a huge difference in my life. Thank you Dr. Garcia and your wonderfully professional team.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Name>Patty O'Hare< /Name>< Rating>

The woman that helped me to choose my glass frames was very sweet and talkative, her name was Elijah. I took a long time choosing my frames and deciding what I wanted. She wasn’t rushing me. We had great conversation while I was there. I’ve been going there since I was in middle school and I highly recommend. The staff was very friendly!<//Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>The staff there was amazing they really go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and it really helps that they ask if you have any questions at all they'd be happy to answer them and when you do have a question they seem to be very knowledgeable which helps out alot . It just seems like they are very eager to listen to any problems are questions that you might have about the different types of eye wear are offers that may & are available to you.
What really stands out the most is never once did I ever feel rushed I felt like as long as I had questions they were there to listen an offer solutions that best met whatever concerns are needs that I might have.
I would definitely recommend them to anybody that might ask.
As far as for anybody that might be considering them are maybe still on the fence about there decision ,
Trust me you can stop wondering if this would be the ideal eye care facility for Your Family , Because I'd say without a doubt "Yes" they Most  Definetly are .</text>< user_name>

Well staffed and polite. A 10:30am appointment means 10:30am, unlike other places where you're waiting another half hour before being seen.
The staff is welcoming and explain everything clearly.
Great selection of frames.  Highly recommended.<//review>

<Text>Family Eyecare with Dr. Jeffrey Garcia in Lemoore has an entire staff of friendly and professional faces.
I was greeted by the staff who ensure to follow all COVID-19 protocols to not only ensure their safety but also those of their patients. I was amazed with how modern this practice is and believe that their state of the art equipment is essential in providing the best care. I admire Dr. Garcia’s dedication to not only create a connection with his patients but also ensuring they have an appointment where all their concerns are heard. I will recommend Dr. Garcia’s practice to friends and family and will gladly return. Marlene did an outstanding job helping me find the right pair of lenses.<//Text>< pics>

I've been coming here for years, and the service and care is always top notch. They take your temp at the door and the wait time was so short. The lobby is clean and the staff all wear masks and they have a hand sanitization pump at the door. They are quick as well as thorough with the examination. The staff were all very polite and informative.<//Review>

Absolutely wonderful  as always. My daughter  always  sees Dr  Guerra. She is very personable and doesn't  just listen to the parents. She also listens to the kids and addresses their concerns too. She is very thorough and explains everything to the kids. All of the staff are just as amazing.< /review>

Everyone from the girls at the front desk, all the way till the end were wonderful! From the Dr who examined me to the gal helping me pick out my glasses. This team is fantastic! I felt like my business was truly appreciated. As far as I'm concerned this is and will be my new eye team. Very professional and a clean office too.

Right from the start if you can read and knock for assistance at the front door they meet you and take your temp and confirm your appointment. I do understand why so many people don't read the sign and just try to to open the door and that's because they have like 8 signs on it. But that in itself is the comical relief you get while waiting to be called to the back. Very professional and informative on your insurance plan which is great.

<Review>The staff is very friendly and helpful. They were very cheerful upon us entering despite that it was early in the morning. The doctors are wonderful no matter who we see. They are always explaining what is going on during our visit. My oldest son gets nervous any time he visits a doctor and everyone  is great working with him and answering his questions. Maria was very patient and wonderful helping us pick out his eye glasses and sports glasses. She asked us what he needed and she catered and answered all our questions. She explained our bill and let us know what insurance will cover and will not. We always enjoy our visits!</Review>< user_name>

Wonderful facility. Love their text alerts for appt reminders and rescheduling. Saturday hours are very helpful for those of us that work and have a hard time getting away during the week. They also have a great selection of glasses! Wish they could provide a wait time when we arrive for appts. Hate waiting 30 min to see a dr. I get sometimes there are double bookings but then let us know wait time so we can go outside and do a call or run a quick errand. All-in-all, a first class eye care facility. Highly recommend!<//Review>

This office, the personnel, the service, care and treatment, unbelievable...  It is very far & few in between that there are healthcare/type offices that treat you like you were their "only" patient that day.

Dr.Luna, her staff, were absolutely so caring, thoughtful and most of all PROFESIONAL & on the Ball, they were right on top of things from the get go.

I went in with a simple but pricey & annoying DMV requested vision report and left with the referral process to my dr for cataract surgery, not to mention all the insurance bull they helped me cut through.

The staff there are the most knowledgeable, professional and caring group that I've seen in a long time.

Thank you Dr. Garcia for putting this wonderful office in our small town.

My family and I have been patients for a few years now and we are impressed at the personal care we receive from Marlene and the optometrists that are employed at family eye care. They have all the styles we love and latest in contact technology. I always feel informed and safe while there.< /Review>

It is such a blessing in a town that’s rather small as ours is, to have such a professional, upscale, caring optometry as Family Eye Care.
I am so impressed that they have such state of the art equipment not being located in a metropolitan area.
Staff is always courteous. You are always greeted when you walk in. I have never had a very long wait time. Dr. Garcia and his staff are able to make sure that your vision is cared for with the most updated knowledge and equipment. We are so lucky and blessed to have them here. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

< Review>
My first time with this facility. Everyone was friendly. My doctor was willing to answer questions and had great bedside manners. The young lady helping me pick out new glasses wasn't pushy and let me look around without trying to up sell me on anything. The place was clean and organized. I was comfortable and I'll definitely be going back. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a new eye care location.</Review>

I've been going to family eye care for years now, and I like the way the doctors are always very happy to explain everything and answer any questions. I believe they really care about their patient's eye health. I also appreciate their friendly staff. I only wish the glasses were more affordable.</review>

<Text>Had and appointment for a child's first ever eye exam.  Waited over 1 1/2 hours before my child was seen.  Other patients arriving after we had already been sitting and waiting were seen before us.  There was an intern there.  Was asked if we would rather see intern or wait for the doctor.  Stated we would wait for the doctor.  Waited additional 30 minutes before being seen.  Exam was great.  Just the wait time was unacceptable.  Was late getting back to work.< /Text>< response>

First, I totally forgot I had an appointment till twenty minutes after I was supposed to be there. The staff was kind enough to squeeze me if, as I had been waiting for a month to get in. Everyone from their assistants to the doctor were very friendly and professional. Marleen assisted me in pick out two pairs of glass and had she not helped me I would have been there for hours trying to decide. She was very friendly, professional and had beautiful brown eyes. Thank you for your assistance and look forward to getting my new glasses.</text>

< review>
We’ve been seeing Dr. Garcia and his staff for about 11 years now.  They take the time to get to know you and provide you with excellent eye care.
Being diabetic, Dr. Garcia (after my eye exam) sent a letter to my Primary Care Physician letting him know I had no diabetic damage to my eyes.
They have an amazing selection of eyewear choices and once you choose a frame your glasses are usually ready for pickup in a few days.
After our last visit, there was a little trouble coordinating our Vision benefits, but Marlene made one phone call to our insurance and everything was straightened out.  Now that’s great customer service.   Our family will be patients of Dr. Garcia for many years to come.  ❤️< /review>

Dr. Garcia was extremely helpful with diagnosing a problem I was having with my new glasses. I had recently had cataract surgery and he figured out my eyes had shifted slightly causing some clarity issues. New lens are on order and this issue will be solved. Dr. Garcia patiently listened to me and solved the problem.  I've knowed Dr. Garcia since my early day of the Navy and I totally trust him. His staff are just simply amazing. Great customer service.</review>

I have been getting my eyes checked here every year for the past three years. I can truly say that Lemoore Family Eye Care goes out of their way to make sure that you have the best experience. It was true for me from the moment I called to make my appointment when I was greeted very professionally. When I got to the clinic, the friendly staff at the front counter made me feel welcomed and were very attentive to my needs. Furthermore, Dr. Garcia put the final touch in this great experience by explaining all the photos taken of my eyes along with recommendations. Overall, the experience was exceptional. If you are looking for the best service and care for your eyes, look no further and visit their office.</review>

< Review>
Usually my experience is wonderful from the beginning until the end. This time not so much. The person who takes you back to check your eyes and prescription was not welcoming at all, it felt like I was just a number, no greeting  just "sit right here and put your chin there. The screen was dirty and hadn't been cleaned from the previous persons use. I mentioned it and she said " oh they didnt clean it". Thank goodness the Dr. I saw was much better and made me feel important. Customer service was lacking and I was disappointed after being a patient there for many many years.< /Review>

Ive always enjoyed going to Dr Garcia and his other Drs have been really great with my kids my last visit must have been too early for his ladies in the front one really looked like she was in a bad mood. Maybe she wasn't feeling good but other than that I have always had great experiences going to Dr Garcia's offices.< /Text>

The Lemoore office is actively sanitized with sanitizing stations.  The office is very spacious, so there is no need for assistance to get me in/out of my huge power wheelchair, SCORE❗ ALL staff are absolutely outstanding💯 I get a comprehensive exam by Dr. Garcia (my personal fav), explained well, doesn't take long & takes the time to answer any questions I may have.  Wait time under 5 minutes, (total time 45 minutes).  EVERYONE treats me like a valued client/patient.  Optometrist Tech Marleen is "THE BOMB,  BOOYA"❗❗❗ Alissiah, is VERY smart, helpful & professional as well, she's a jack of all trades & a keeper.  Zeida, Donna, Ivy, Maria, Christine ALL answer the phone professionally with a cheerful tone & if they are busy, other staff readily helps out.  If they put you on hold it's for seconds, not minutes or oops hung up on.  I am VERY exacting & picky.  I do know that I must drive these outstanding people crazy, but they don't give me the evil or rolling eyes👍 Professional, dedicated, easy going & caring staff that I am pleased with😊  Without a doubt, I Will return as needed. A+👍  BEST of the BEST❗  LUV my eye care family💚💚💚</Text>
