<review>Do not buy from MSI. They are not up front about their rebates and the process to redeem them. They claim to have sent a message by mail indicating that my rebate was denied because I hadn't uploaded something. Fun fact: I bought two computers for two different households, neither of us got this message by post.
Further, their rebates send an email after registering that the process progress would be updated via email. No emails besides the initial were sent.
In this manner you forget and then when you recall what you are owed, too.much time has passed.
I like the product but because of this I will never buy from MSI again.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Horrible repair system. They charge you to send in pc/laptop for diagnostics which they offer to deduct if you opt to proceed with repairs.

Seems reasonable until you know what you need and just want a straight forward quote for an already known repair.

In my case, they keyboard cable is damaged and the only repair is a full keyboard replacement on the laptop (MSI GTVW with Tobii Eye tracking and gtx1070 graphics). I simply need to know how much to replace old keyboard with a new one instead of laying out cash in advance only to find out their charges for a replacement are horrible ridiculous like most manufacturer repair services.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Hands down worst customer service experience to date.  I tried not to judge them based on the first (few) contacts, but the telephone customer service representatives got worse as time went on.
A key cap came off my laptop a few months after I bought it, 6 weeks after calling them and the wonderful "Customer Service Manager" (who also answered the queue call) told me that I had to sit around and wait some more.  Literally told me to "just sit around and wait."
Naturally, as always, there was no one else to talk to, I even asked for someone who might even just feel like being a little bit nicer, but no.
If it were an isolated incident I wouldn't be here writing this review, but jesus they're awful, time to vote with my wallet.<//review>< Pictures>

<user_id>113763598188153976702< /user_id><Review>MSI GS73 Stealth Pro laptop... Left side LCD hinge broke away from the LCD back cover aluminum screw mounts tonight when I went to close it. This happened on my GS72 after 6-7 months... it took 2 months on my new GS73. Keyboard still shorts out when pressure applied to bottom case resulting innnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn keys typing forever until pressure is removed. Keys when pressed are squeaky (just started recently), upgrading nvme SSD requires removal of motherboard (PITA, can't suggest for novices), aluminum case is so thin it bends/wraps very easily. Laptop randomly locks up and crashes, usually when you least expect it so always save your work!). I cannot recommend MSI laptops due to poor build quality. If you send your laptop in for RMA, it will take 2-3 weeks to get it back. Not acceptable for a $2,000+ laptop that is your daily machine. I use mine for business and pleasure and I can't be without mine for 2-3 days, let alone 2-3 weeks.< /Review>< Rating>

Don't trust their rebates. I bought a desktop tower case. it came with an MSI/ American Express Prepaid Credit Card. There was a hidden $2.00 monthly fee. By the time I was ready to use it, there was $0.00 balance on this pre-paid. Customer service at American express was unacceptable. They kept me on hold. Very unacceptable. If it guarantees $40.00 rebate toward purchases, then I want that rebate regardless. This is another sales loophole to increase sales. American Express should be ashame of such immoral tactics as this.< /text>

<date>1481750322034< /date><userid>105395463902551941931< /userid><text>After 3 months of owning my GT73VR-6RF I have encountered the following issues.

1. Screen Bleed at the bottom (120Hz version IPA panel). Which became more visible in recent days.
2. GPU toggle button no longer works. (Stopped working after a windows update, troubleshooting involved reinstalling SCM and Dragon Center - Did not fix the issue.)
3. Steel series button no longer pulls if the steel series app. (Reinstalling the newest version of Steel Series) did not resolve the problem.
4. When Xotic PC sent me this laptop it came with a green dragon logo, and not the white logo I had chosen at the time of purchase.

My experience with Xotic was fairly predictable as I was far out of my 15-day return policy. And the RMA process is around 10 days. This being my work PC that would be impossible and they do not send temp laptops to use while yours is being worked on. So your basically just S.O.L..

My biggest issues are these....

I should not have screen bleed on a laptop I spent 3200 dollars on, and if it does happen, at least offer a temp for working people. I understand there is always a chance of getting a bad unit, so this one I can let go since it is RMA fixable.

As for giving me a green dragon instead of the white one I ordered, Xotic PC did say that could be swapped with by RMA'ing it as well.

But, I SHOULD NOT have to worry about my laptops hardware buttons (GPU Toggle, and Steel Series button) becoming in-active or broken after a windows update. Windows updates often, and I don't want to have to RMA my laptop every time it happens.

I'm now worried about the future of this laptop. Eventually, my warranty will run out, and this laptop is a desktop replacement that should last longer than 2 years. Which means that everytime windows updates outside of my warranty, I will then have to pay to get it fixed.

Had I known...

The screen had bleed RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX - I wouldn't have bought it. (MSI rep said ALL IPA screens have a degree of bleed and that its normal)
The GPU toggle button, and the Steel Series button have a chance of breaking upon installing Windows Updates - I wouldn't have bought it.
The wrong color logo - Really Xotic PC? I spent 3200 on this thing and you didn't even get my logo right? The red coloring on the laptop makes it look like a Christmas themed laptop. - I wouldn't have bought it. (Based not only on aesthetics, but lack of attention to detail during manufacture)

Like anyone, after spending 3200 dollars on a laptop you would hope to never encounter these issues. Especially after only 3 months... Realistically though, it could happen.

Unfortunately now I'm afraid to update windows because it might cause more buttons to function incorrectly.

I of course am very dissatisfied with this product and would like MSI or Xotic PC to contact me for an exchange or return.

I will be posting this review on every review site possible. Because I don't believe anyone should pay 3200 for a laptop that 3 months down the line will encounter screen bleed, hardware button malfunction, and poor manufacturing with lack of attention to detail.

Thanks, and Happy Holidays!</text>< gmapID>

<Review>MSI's warranty service is crap. Heck, many of their computers likely aren't crap, but mine was/is. (I say was because I sent it in for warranty service--we'll see what I get back)

Anyhoo...

When buying an MSI, realize that for warranty service you will be paying out of pocket to ship your computer to MSI. Also realize that you'll need to confirm and reconfirm that your RMA includes all of the issue-specific information that you shared with the customer service rep who provided it. (Case in point: I shared myriad, detailed information with the rep, only to receive an RMA confirmation with one general issue listed. I called to verify that all of the specific information I previously shared about my computer's multiple issues had been documented--as the rep stated he was doing during our initial conversation--only to find out that NONE of my information had been documented. Needless to say, I rehashed and they supposedly forwarded the information to the service department.)

Also, realize that warranty "service" means you'll ship your computer to MSI and they'll take WEEKS to fix it. Heck, they'll take WEEKS to even START fixing it. I shipped my computer off two weeks ago (via Priority Mail) and MSI hasn't even moved my computer past the "arrived" stage in as much time.

Warranties and "customer service" aside, these computers aren't well made. I've had an MSI Ghost GS70 for just over a year and it's overheated since day one. I've never been able to play a game on it because the processor can't bear the load, and the fans can't compensate for the excessive heating (upwards of 180+ degrees F, then shutdown). I did everything I could to optimize the system (turned turbo off and green mode on, reduced frame rates, disabled programs, etc, etc, etc) and this system STILL overheated when I surfed the net. Talk about a $1500+ piece of junk. It looks great, it's thin, it's relatively light, it's a great color, but if you can't use it for any CPU-tapping tasking it's junk, plain and simple.

Long story shorter, I will never buy MSI again. Their computers are subpar and the customer service is abysmal--particularly their version of warranty service, which is offensive to anyone that uses a computer given that you have to pay to ship your defective computer to them and then wait ages to ever get it back. As if we don't live and breathe attached to our computers these days??!!

BOTTOM LINE: Buy an MSI computer at your own risk AND realize that the warranty service is subpar for the industry.<//Review>< resp>

< review>
Horrific company if you need an RMA, sent back a graphics card (that was just released that month), took over 2 weeks to hear back from them that they didn't have stock and that they were going to refund me. Agreed to a refund of $480, then downgraded it to $220, and finally settled on $260. Check was finally sent almost 5 weeks after this process started, it even took a trip from California to Rhode Island before finally arriving back in Phoenix, AZ which kind of symbolically represented the whole experience, worse part is that when I brought up the concern that my check traveled clear across the country, their answer was "Contact USPS yourself" and even had the gall to say on the BBB report I was "confused" about it going to Rhode Island in the First Place even though it shows its path right in the tracking.

Oh yeah and to top it off their customer service response time is horrendous, towards the end it took 1 week for them to even respond to my concern about how the check was being sent and when.< /review>

So excited to find a truck near me that sells birria tacos! The food is amazing. Heads up the wait is typically long. I've waited 45 minutes for my food  on busy nights.< /Text>

<Text>Without a doubt this is the best birria in Los Angeles . The queso taco is always super crispy, flavorful , cheesy and perfect. Their homemade juices are delicious , try the pineapple or strawberry :)</Text>< user_id>

Simple menu of food done well. Birria is flavorful on it's own, but extra consumé and toppings make it better. The tacos are double shelled and even with the soft shelled tacos, the outer one is crispy which provides a good contrast to softer ingredients. It's a popular place, so expect a 15 -20 minute wait (hint you'll want seconds so order liberally).</Review>

<Review>I've tried this San Marco's about three times. The first two times it was good. This last time it was a "oh no" situation. We normally get the birria plate and the queso tacos. This time we wanted to see what the hype was about the Ramen birria. We get home and we all took a spoon full of the ramen and it was like a spoon full of Salt!!! I tried calling them back and no answer. We tried adding water, lemon onion and salsa and nothing could make it better. It was such a bummer.<//Review>< GmapID>

It looks amazing but the tacos have no flavor at all not even a hint of saltiness. The spiciest salsa tastes like spicy water. The consume isn’t really broth it’s more like a tasteless red grease/oil. Wouldn’t try again but I’m glad I’m over the hype 😭<//text>< Name>

It all started with a video over on youtube and now it has become one of the Best Places to eat when my Girlfriend and I are in the mood for great food and a nice drive. I always get a "Consomé" no matter what I'm eating; Whether it be the "Queso Tacos" or the regular "Birria Tacos". Check this guys out, you will not be disappointed.<//Review>

So good.  I've been to two locations now and both were delicious. I suggest the queso-tacos and dipping them in the broth.  The only draw back is the parking is a little rough and hard to come by at times but well worth the couple times driving around looking for a spot.</text>

If you're of any latino descent, this food is amazing. If you're not and are afraid of getting a little bit of grease stains on your clothes, this is not for you. But the over the food is a solid 9/10.</text>

THE BEST TACOS! Came here all the way from Utah and they went above and beyond, they even threw in 2 extra items and an extra cup of consommé just to make sure we had a great experience! Highly recommend! Get here early in the day if you want to skip the long lines</Review>

The food is great so much flavor on the birria and the conzome. The only reason I gave it 4 star instead of 5 is because they advertise 24 hour service daily but during the week the open at 9am, however that will be me spot to eat everytime i visit LA<//Text>

Birria is ok but not super tasty, tacos El Guero At Tujunga av and Sherman way are better and cheaper. Now you go to both and decide for yourself.< /review>

<Text>It's unique blend of spices and freshness is what stands out at this restaurant.  I was never a fan of mole until I ate it here. The complexities of each spice stands out at El Pueblo. They do this dish justice with the rich flavors bursting in your mouth with hints of cinnamon,  oregano, chocolate, and clove among the many other ingredients in this dish. I came here twice to check the consistency of the dish which was spot on if not better the second time around.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiglPR_SfqY_EQ9zWFa9Zayr_v2MQ6hfNJsR8e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEli7fdgh_i1lzCliIPapqY47E3TftirBW5Y9u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ082oaMEBYSm3-UgP8C5Pn5QHxCM2NZ8mC1u4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQEF9EQjbDjmHWAg3TktdnkL-8Gd0ilJZE3Aec=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c286619ff1c8ff:0xb4737d41cc47ca38<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I got the camarones a la diabla it was really delicious . The only thing was we didn't get chips n salsa I'm guessing they don't so you can eat all your plate because that's what we did so good< /text>

So good!! I'm not from here but saw this place had good looking food photos compared to the other mexican restaurants in the area so I  got two child relleno burritos for $8.99 each and they are so dang good!! Their salsa are is delicious, and my salsa standards are pretty high! They not only have great food but they also have yummy pan dulce inside which I was pleasantly surprised to see. The place is clean which is another big bonus for me since it feels so clean to eat from there. Support this locally owned business! :-) the only con is that I live in Pasadena so i probably won't be in the area to try other things but I'm sure to come back if I'm in the area again.<//Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Sure, sometimes there are long lines but this place gets 5 stars for literally giving you free nespresso coffee of your choice as you buy more nespresso capsules that you're so addicted to. They are very helpful in explaining new flavors and helping you get exactly what you need. Remember to ask for the recyclable bags on your way out.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c286619ff1c8ff:0xb4737d41cc47ca38< /gmapID></record>

<Review>Best little Mexican restaurant I have been to in a long time. My boyfriend and I enjoy having breakfast at this place. The Mexican bread is always warm and delicious. If your a fan of mexican horchata you must try theirs just the right sweetness.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I love this place so much I kind of don't want to rate it because I feel like once people get wind of how delicious the food here is it's going to become crowded the most delicious Mexican food in Santa Clarita hands down! I might even go as far as to say the most delicious food from Santa Clarita to San Fernando Valley.</Text>< Rate>

We were the only ones there (which was concerning) but we were pleasantly surprised.  The service was good and the food was even better.  Those people waiting across the street are missing out!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Came here yesterday w a huge group. I was surprised how fast our food came considering a group of 30 dropped in w out a reservation.
The salsa was SO delcious and their tortillas and chalupas were the best Ive ever had. Extremely authentic! This is one of my top 3 favorites in Santa Clarita.</Text><GmapID>0x80c286619ff1c8ff:0xb4737d41cc47ca38<//GmapID>< Name>

This evening, my family and I attended for dinner. We ordered two cheese quesadilla , Barbacoa and Cameron’s de cocktail. The food and atmosphere was amazing!! It’s very hard to find good Barbacoa and we really appreciated the service as well. Highly recommend this place.< /Review>

This place is small but very nice. Love the decor. The service was excellent and the food was exquisite! Everything was fresh, including the chips and salsa. The Agua frescas were very refreshing and tasty. We're definitely returning... btw the prices are reasonable; won't break the bank.</Text>

I had a wet shrimp burrito and it was delicious! The only bad thing about this place was there was only one waiter and he really was doing the best he could. It had gotten so busy at one point I thought the waiter had forgotten our order. But it didn't matter how busy the place would get the waiter was always professional and courteous. Thank you so much!!!</Text>

My dog Ollie cut open his foot  on a broken mirror.
Poor guy.
He needed stitches.
Dr. Nolasco and staff took great care of him.
They were very kind and efficient.
Also, they are open 7 days a week which is very convenient for us working pet parents.</review>

I've gone for two pet emergencies here, and I have been so happy with the staff and my experience as a pet owner. I felt really informed and was provided with estimates before any further actions were taken with my pets. Will continue to seek the guidance of this team with my pets!< /Text>

<text>While the wait time may seem a bit long even when the office was empty, the doctor’s knowledge, care and bedside manner were stellar. Had to bring my mom’s dog in for an emergency visit when there was blood in the urine and the doctor and staff were great, responsive, and incredibly informative.</text>< Time>

He had been neglected. I took him to Valley Animal  Hospital. They took  wonderful care of him and charged 20 percent less than  usual. I was grateful and satisfied with their service. As for the staff... whom among us is always chipper and attentive at  work. Lighten up and be a bit more patient. Thanks to the staff and vets my rescued pup is healthy and living with me and the rest of the "pack".< /Text><time>1392677335044< /time>< Name>

<review>When my family and I leave for vacations (averaging 4 days or so), we have my dog board here.

Upon seeing the place in which my dog would stay, I was so sad to see that the conditions were/are very poor. The hospital's website states: "On occasion when we go out of town we need a place for our furry family member to stay while we are gone. Your pet can stay in a temperature controlled environment where he/she will be loved and cared for by our staff. He/she will stay in a spacious dog run with views of his/her neighbors and talk to the others about their great family and how much they are loved."

This is all complete bullshit. They sleep in caged, wired boxes(essentially) on a cold, hard cement floor. I hope that they at least provide them with a blanket considering they are sleeping on bare cement and during the winter time. The dogs in there are miserable; though it is true the dogs will view their "neighbors", it is because they have so little space. I do not buy any of their tempered, cutesy rhetoric. The staff are both nice and lifeless, basically.

I cannot speak for their medical services because my pet has only received shots from this place, no surgery or urgent medical treatment.

Tl;dr - if you love your pet, please do not board them here. You get what you pay for< /review><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>116054902706623248912</UserId.>< Rate>

<rating>1<//rating><review>This place is a complete rip-off. The X-ray equipment used on my cat could not even capture the image. And even though the vet admitted that their machines we're old as the reason why the image was not captured, I was still charged $250. Not to mention they suggested several other tests be ran on my cat that would have been even more expensive and very painful for her. Dr. Renia in Hollywood Worked out to be the best veterinarian I have ever been to. We were able to find out what was wrong with my cat she has mild asthma.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

He was already gone (I just didn't want to accept it).  Anyway, they took him from me to a back room, said I couldn't come in. I thought they were trying to save him. They had just left him in that room all alone. When I demanded to see him they would not let me until I paid them almost 300 dollars. I was freaking, pleading that I just wanted to hold him while he was still warm. No way, had to pay. I remember thinking, "Thank God the office is totally empty, they can concentrate totally on saving my Rungkin" To say the least, that's not what they were thinking. I'm sure if there had been witnesses they wouldn't have ripped me off so easily. Coldest thing I've ever experienced from a human.</review><name>Janelle Delabar< /name>< pictures>

I was very dissatisfied with the service I received from this establishment. I took my dog in for 5 day kennel service and grooming. During my pets stay she got a wound on her paw, which wasn't observed until she was picked up. Not to mention, this occurred 2 yrs prior. I called the hospital and made them aware of the wound that occurred while my pet was in their kennel. They had the nerve to charge me $180.00 for their failure of not properly taking care of my pet.  I have taken all my pets to this hospital for over 20 yrs and I have never had to experience this bad quality of service. I am unhappy with the proper care for my dog or assistance to the charges that I was billed additionally for their error.               Linda- unsatisfied customer</Text>

Dropped off my long hair cat so he could have a bath.  A friend brought him there and back as I just got out of the hospital.  When I took him out of the carrier, one entire side of his fur was one giant mat. They were closing so I couldn’t call to have this fixed. I ended up having that side of his body shaved to the skin in order to get that huge mat removed.  If they could mess up a bath, I certainly wouldn’t trust them to care for a wound or illness. TAKE YOUR PETS SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU LOVE THEM!!!< /text>

Beware, they killed my dog and only care to drain your pocket. If your pet is important to you, Make yourself a favor and don't go there. I was dumb and fool not to read their review and now my dog is gone. A simple care ended up all night bleeding. I'm so sad that I went there. How the hell this place is still operating? The gov has the answer. I already submitted a claim to the California board and hopefully they will shots down this so called hospital.</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I brought my 2yr old Frenchie here for the first time today after growing tired of his previous vets SUPER long waits and rude staff. I give Valley Animal Hospital 5 stars for many reasons; 1) they gave me a same day appointment at a time in need. 2) there office visits are only $48.00  3) the place is VERY clean. 4) The staff and doctor were very straight forward and polite. 5) my dog always growled and got anxious at his old vet and did not act like that here, he was much more calm and relaxed. 6) the doctor did not try and rip me off by ordering any "extra/costly" blood or skin tests. 7) the meds my dog needed were in stock and readily available. 8) the establishment is with in 5 miles of my home.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Is not every day that I write a review but there are times when I have to let other know what places/services they need to *avoid*

This -hospital- place is a clown short of a circus.  They can care less about what my dog needed.  After 2 minutes talking to the "vet" I got a bad vibe (he seemed more interested in his phone than on what I was trying to explain what was going on with my dog) and excused myself and left the place not without first paying over couple of hundred for tests that were not needed.

This place is a mere two block away from my house but I will not go inside again ever.  I rather take the extra time and effort to take my dogs to a palace I know has their best interest in hand.

My visit was at the beginning of this year.</text>

HORRIBLE! brought a feral kitten (tiny) in and they advised it would die b/c of the fleas, so we listened and went along with the flea solution they told us to put on her - it killed her by the next morning!  NEXT we captured the mother cat to have her spade and THEY WOULDN'T EVEN DISCOUNT the price - a big sign they DO NOT CARE about animals - they are an EMBARRASSMENT to Vets everywhere - READ THE OTHER REVIEWS, so many bad ones, they should be closed!< /Text>

If I could give them zero stars I would....my cat was so sick and I took her there for xrays turns out she was really constipated so she would need to go under anesthesia and get cleaned out....they didn't care enough to tell me she was under weight to b going under anesthesia she was 5 pounds....I got a call the next day saying she passed away from the anesthesia. ..and they would give me her body back or even see her unless I paid $800 for all the things she needed done even tho they didn't perform the procedure...so I never got her back and it breaks my heart that this place could have prevented her death if they cared enough to tell me she was to underweight....:'(< /text>

< Review>
The only thing good about this place is Richard at the front desk.  Dr. Perry is very condescending and cold.  They don't provide overnight care so if your dog needs surgery NEVER take them here.  You will have to transfer to an emergency hospital that is only open from 6pm  to 8 am and then you have to pick your pet back up and transfer them again.  Ridiculous!  Also, Dr. Perry was not at all good with my little chihuahua.  NO BEDSIDE MANNER.  I will not be back!</Review>

<Text>I have been going to this vet for several years, and in the past I can say that I have received caring service for my pets. In more recent times, I can say that the doctors have been good with my pets...the front office staff and some of the technicians however, are completely heartless and inept individuals. It is not alright to treat people like they are idiots...I understand that dealing with stressed out people is not fun...but that is the downside of working in this field. The word care is in the title of your job...do it...<//Text><time>1389842225330</time>< rating>

I have used this hospital for about 15 years and I am happy with their service and professionalism.  About a couple of years ago they hired a new manager for the office and I believe this is where some of the trouble resides in the complaints.  They horribly underpay the staff and as a result they seem to go through many people for the front office.  Other than that it is an excellent facility.< /Review>

<review>This place took my money and ruined my dogs teeth. They removed the wrong tooth that had an abses, and because of that it never went away! When I went back to them they denied that there was anything wrong ( my dog is white and fluffy and he clearly​ had a black scab on his face) The x-rays that they took before surgery, were somehow non existent now. It was all mess. And I was not going to pay for anything else. I went to another hospital instead. My dog is now healthy, with a few missing teeth but at least he's alive.< /review>< user_id>

<Review>DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!
This place is horrible, I brought my dog in for an exam, The vet performed a rectal exam which caused my dog to stop walking properly in his back legs wasn't able to go to the restroom anymore and cried nonstop. I'm telling you the reader, before I took my dog in, my dog could walk properly and use the restroom fine their was nothing wrong with him except he was constipated. I went back to demand they treat what they caused to my dog on May 29, 2016 The owner said he would only treat him if I payed. I said no why would I pay for something you caused, and I got into a huge argument with the owner of the place. Well the owner didn't care. I'm writing this because my dog had a seizure it had trouble breathing and it passed away on May 30, 2016. If you love your pets take them somewhere else where they do care about your pet and its customers because this place does not. I plan on suing this place for malpractice I've already contacted an attorney because my dog deserved more than this.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c29749650f4aa3:0x306cf1b1606a40d6< /gmap_id></record>

I brought my cat when  he was limping for some injury that was not evident to me. He wouldn't  let me touch him, when I brought him here he was handled with such ease he never complained. The dr. gave me specific instructions  and meds to help him recover, and he did fully.
I also have two dogs and one had to be seen because of an allergic reaction. Not only Dr. Ashkan addressed her symptoms but alerted me on a possible thyroid problem and suggested  a course of action for this and some dental problems.
Girls in the front office are very professional, nice and bilingual.
The costs of services is very fair and affordable.</review>

<Time>1454204886842</Time><Rate>5</Rate><review>Love this place. By far the most honest vet ive been to. They saw my dog in a timely manner even though it had to be by appointment. Which was made for only an hour after i arrived. What i most appreciated was that my dog was evaluated before any yalk of money was made. I was given options towards what i would like to do with my dog. Only the services i requested dor where done with no extras. This is my second visit here to the valley animal hospital. The first was more then pleasant as well as my second. For sure if any other medical needs should be neededin the future this is definitely first to come to mind and would gladly and strongly recomend this place to all pet owners.

<text>it is horrible how they treated me and how they sent my dog to the creamatorium.They didnt tell me that he died before sending him away. I suspect of course that they did something wrong to my dog and to cover it up after he died or
because they made a mistake and would not own  up to it.  I brought my beautiful aaakita in for boarding for some x rays and a blood test.  the next day I go to pick him up and they say he is dead.  They   tried to call but couldnt find the right number THAT WAS A LIE   I reached down to show George the manager  and  on the form I filled out the day before  there was my correct phone number. I would suggest not to take your pet there unless you would like to put them down!!!

DISHONEST:  They are dishonest about the actual total cost of services until AFTER they have given the services and you are forced to pay for it.  They were not upfront about the actual cost of services!  After my cat was seen by the doctor, another man named Omar, a nurse I think, came in and quoted me a price for the services that the doctor recommended.  I specifically asked him "what is the total out the door price that I am looking at for this list of services", and he said "$220 for the whole thing."  Based on this total price he told me, I said okay go ahead.  When I went outside to pay a deposit, the receptionist told me the total charges were $306 for the exact same list of services.  After a few moments of disagreement on the price, I reluctantly agreed to $306 since my cat was in pain and needed to be cared for.
The next day, a man who sounded like Omar, called me and told me that my pet needed additional services.  Again I asked him twice "what will be the TOTAL additional charges for all these additional services," and he said "a total of $70 more."  I said "okay, go ahead, but not for more than $70."  When I went to pick up my cat later that day, the front receptionist actually charged me $158 in additional fees.  The total cost that was quoted to me for these services for the two days was $290, but they actually charged me $464 for the exact same list of services.  Nothing additional was done to even begin to justify the higher fee.
This technique that they used of quoting me a lower price before the services were rendered, and the inflated price they actually charged for the same exact list of services when I went to pay is very deceptive and dishonest!  They were not honest about their pricing upfront even when I specifically ask them what the total cost is or will be.</Text>

Such a rip off. Don't attend to go to this hospital. Save your money and go somewhere else. Richard is straight up rude and half ass at his job. They don't care about the well being of the animals and only in it for the money.< /text>

I called them around 6:00pm and they close at 7:00 and  I asked them if they could please see my dog,there's something wrong with him, "well his last appointment is at 6:20 so your gonna have to bring him in tomorrow"  me: there's something really wrong, sorry they said. Our dogs are family to us and the way I see it,it's a business for them,not love for our animals it seems to me..</Text>

Everyone there is wonderful; friendly and caring, and they actually remember your name, ask about your family, and just generally make you feel as comfortable as they can 😊 In the chair the procedures are relatively painless, and staff and doctors are always extremely attentive and skilled, along with the essential good sense of humor!  I have recommended Pittsburg Family Dental to friends, and will continue to do so going forward. 🥰< /Text>

<Text>First time visit. Everyone was nice, friendly and hospitable. It was a warm good vibe. I'm glad I found this family dental place. Dr. Lin was very comforting and very careful in what he does and made sure his patients are okay before he does his presieger. His assistant was also very nice and engaging. The receptionist was also welcoming and engaging and very nice. See you guys soon. Thank you for making this a wonderful experience ☺<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

They don’t know how to call back when it comes to reschedule appointments. They call me back the same day I had a appointment and cancelled on me after I took that day off. I’m not happy at all with them time to switch off< /review>
<pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1531354379810, 'text': 'Monica, I am really sorry to hear this. The office makes best effort to not inconvience the patient but sometimes there are situations out of our control that make it necessary to reschedule for your best interest. If a doctor is out sick, we rather you come see the same doctor instead of a different dentist every time. Again, I hope you come back to us and we can regain your trust. I am happy to look into what happened in your particular case with your consent of-course, so that we do not repeat it again. :)'}< /Resp>< gmapID>

Let me just say, Perfect Locks is by far the best company for extensions. I have been ordering from them for years and I have never had a problem with an order. Shipping is quick, customer service is fantastic and knowledgeable, and the hair is beyond amazing! I mean what other company offers this many installation methods and textures?! Natural wavy hair is hard to find and you can’t find curly hair anywhere. I will always recommend them and I completely stand behind all of their products. Please educate yourself before ordering hair. You won’t be disappointed! 💕</text>

<Resp>{'time': 1620855421717, 'text': "Hello Space Kitty,\n\nWe are sorry to hear that our 20” curly bundle of hair was shorter than you had expected. Please note that we measure all of our hair when it's straight, which means our curly texture may appear shorter in its natural state. Due to this, each bundle may come with an extra 1 to 2 inches to ensure you get the most out of your look. We also offer a length guide on our website to help you determine which length would be the best match for you.\n\nOur return policy is quite unique and flexible as we are one of the only companies to offer refunds on unused packages. The 15% restocking fee is applied as each item returned needs to be inspected and sanitized. We also offer the option to do an exchange or store credit which is a great way to avoid paying the restocking fee.\n\nKatelyn N.\nCustomer Service Manager\n1-888-290-4771"}<//Resp><GmapID>0x80855e48fb17bd3f:0xe97a5162eb67de32<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

As a girl who constantly cuts, bleaches, and colors her hair a lot, this place has helped me so much when I need different hair extensions! This company has such a diverse amount of hair extensions, especially when it comes to the color, hair type, and length! Katelyn, one of the many friendly employees, helped me when I didn't know where to begin with my hair! She was so nice with helping me try on different ones to match my hair color and style.
When trying on the different types of hair extensions, I was amazed by the quality of it! The hair extension that I got was soft and smooth, it blended in with my hair! The extensions were very easy to use as well. The price is good for the quality and amount of hair you get! Highly recommend this place!</text>

My experience with Perfect Locks was nothing but pleasant and professional. They are quick to answer any questions or concerns you may have. The return policy was quick and haggle free. The bulk hair is a little pricey but well worth it. The quality is great and I have experienced no matting, shedding or short pieces like you get with some bulk hair. All in all I would recommend trying this company.</Text>

<text>I just signed on as a perfect locks pro so I can give the experience to my New Jersey hair extension clients. My experience with the representative and the technician that answer my questions has truly been 5 stars. They provide every texture of hair and every installation method which is not easy to find! The hair itself is beautiful and wears well after each shampoo . I’m happy I found you!!< /text></record>

<Review>Timely delivery. After washing and conditioning  the hair, it blends very nicely with my hair. I does shed when I brush it. I am hoping that stops after the next wash. But I like the texture, which is like my 4b hair straightened.< /Review>< date>

I have always used the tape in extensions until this last purchase. The beaded weft is HORRIBLE. it's thin and I mean THIN and very stringy on the ends. For the price of these extentions they should be full . VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. I will not shop here again . DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. 😡</review>

<review>I waited a few months (3) before writing this review to see how I liked my curly Honey Blonde Tape in Extensions.  I tried them for volume and to see if I could then let my hair grow longer - yes and yes. They are holding up beautifully and are satiny smooth.  I had to trim off approximately 0.75" due to modest relaxation of curl the first week but that has been it.  The extensions take longer to dry as the diameter of the hair is greater than mine.  This DOES NOT affect how beautifully and invisibly they blend with my natural hair.  Only downside is removal.  It is a pain and time consuming (I do it myself) but doable.  Oh, on a final note, customer service has been absolutely wonderful - both by chat and phone call!  Until I get over myself, I will be continuing with Perfect Locks.< /review>< pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I paid 400 for hair extensions to be put in for my wedding. 2 weeks after my wedding they were very dry and damaged and knotting up . so I took them out. I cleaned them and stored them properly and was thinking of having them put back in and I went to a stylist with them to see about color matching to my color now and they said they could not lighten them because they were synthetic. What a rip off they lie and tell you its real Remy hair and its not. I paid almost 400 for hair that was worth maybe 50.<//Review>< pictures>

I have a natural deep wavy/loose curly texture that is so dry and frizzy. I've tried other curly products, but nothing seemed to be moisturizing enough for me. After using their curl care products my hair feels amazing and so bouncy. It really helps blend my natural hair with their extensions. I also love that these products work with colored hair.

I probably have paid way more buying cheap wigs over and over because the hair gets tangled and matted after wearing them just a few times. I took my time and read the reviews on the website and even called to talk with someone at Perfect Locks twice. Without a doubt this hair is top quality. It looks and feels like your own hair; plus it’s comfortable. I wear it everyday! Get this wig. You won’t be sorry.<//review>< pictures>

If I could give zero stars I would. Not only was the hair frizzy and full of split ends, the ends started turning black after a couple weeks. I spent almost $500 and I 100% regret it. After 5 weeks my stylist, who is experienced in tape ins, took them out to move them up (using their recommended products) and I’ve lost HALF of my hair. I am not over exaggerating. I haven’t stop crying all day. The extensions themselves have lost so much hair as well. We tried to call and they “can’t find” the order even though we have proof with receipt and bank charges. They refuse to give back any money and said they can only provide me “maintenance tips”. The worst costumer service. SUCH BS. I’m begging you, do NOT buy from these products. A complete scam. If I would have known I’d spend $500 for 5 weeks of long hair ending with a nightmare I would have never ordered. I just want my money back, please.<//Text>< Pics>

My experience with Perfect Locks has been amazing. I sent several photos of my hair both in the straightened state and natural curly state. I explained my hair goals to the color specialist at Perfect Locks and she recommended 2 colors of curly extensions to be sandwiched together. I followed her advice and the result is just beautiful. These hair extensions are a finer texture and curlier than the pin straight ones I was buying from my salon which is marvelous because my own hair is fine and curly, so the constant straightening was doing damage. Not only that, my hair looked a bit weird in higher humidity levels.

The quality of the extensions is very nice, as in super healthy, shiny, undamaged, hair! There is also no slippage with the tapes, which says a lot, as I am a distance runner and my hair is often drenched in sweat, winter and summer. Slippage was an annoying problem with the Easi-Hair Pro line of extensions my salon uses, and I was paying roughly the same price.

I also ordered the Curl Care Shampoo, Conditioner, Amplifying Cream, and Nourishing Spray, and I have to say I LOVE the Curl Care products! They leave my hair and extensions super shiny and bouncy. This is a very worthwhile purchase. I believe the products will allow me to get 6-12 months out of the extensions because I let them air dry.

I really can’t say enough about the tremendous customer service Perfect Locks provides, in addition to their outstanding products. I appreciate their commitment to using only the healthiest, ethically sourced, hair. I mean, do you really want to buy hair from China that is being saved from people’s combs? I don’t. Please support this great company. In the human hair biz, you truly do get what you pay for.<//Text>

<Review>I purchased loosely curly steam permed weave - did NOT receive it! After waiting over 8 weeks I received a cheaper hair texture - it was loosely curly but NOT steamed permed. I am a 10 year customer that spent $$$$ dollars with this company. I don’t have a famous name but I am a hard working beautiful retired Air Force disabled veteran that is extremely disappointed with this company and how it has gone down over the years. This hair is not cheap, but for them to think they can get over on me by sending me cheaper hair is disloyal to me.  They will make this right, and I will not purchase from them again. Customers...Perfect locks customers, this company is not the same...let’s give our money some place else and give new companys a chance...perfect locks is far from perfect!<//Review>< response>

I’m one of those people that have to see it to believe it. This most definitely also applies to hair! I need to touch and feel it... I’m not about to drop this kind of cash on something virtual! This is not a video game, THIS IS REAL LIFE PEOPLE!!!

Perfect Locks checks all the boxes. Love the quality and the staff is nice. I’m so thankful to have found a place like this in the Bay Area. Don’t go anywhere else!</review>

All the brands start out relatively the same with tangle free hair but within about a month I start noticing the ends becoming tangled and dry but not with my perfect locks I have reused it already 3 months, I ordered two more sets so I can just take one out and have the other ready and one for highlights!

Prices are a little high but I feel good knowing I’m getting my hair and services done in the same place... so far there’s no problem but if there is I know I can contact them for help. Nick was very friendly during my consultation and did a great job with my fusion install. The overall process was smooth, and I’ll be coming back for a touch up on about 4 weeks. If you’re going to spend good money on extensions I would recommend getting them done here.

I had an amazing experience here. It was my first time getting extensions but they made me feel comfortable and welcome even though I was running late. I went in thinking a sew-in weave would be best but I got inch tape-ins to match my natural color and am really happy with how they turned out. They took their time styling my hair to make sure I looked great! You can tell they know what they are doing with the way everything was prepared and all the information they gave me. I particularly like the maintenance tips which I’ve been following religiously. I feel they totally gave me my money’s worth.</review>

By far longest lasting hair I’ve ever used. I have the 22in wavy dark brown and the hair is beautiful!! I use the tape and other supplies that come with the tape ins as well and it’s all fabulous and products work amazing!< /review>

The hair feels very soft and blends well with my naturally curly hair. It’s also very light weight, You do not feel it in your hair or pulling on your scalp.</Review>

money on hair so it was tough for me to splurge… But I’m so glad I did!! Now I know why my friends shop here. The hair is QUALITY. Their customer service is really good too. And I love that they have so many types of hair. I’ve always thought about wigs and they have an amazing

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I purchased these extensions because of hair loss from chemotherapy. The salon I went to said I needed to get them first and they would put them on. I was lost!! Ok I can do this. I just started googling tape in hair extensions. Perfect Locks was the easiest to navigate and they had wavy extensions. Picked the ones I wanted and the color was an exact match for me. I ordered them and they came 2 days before expected delivery. My stylist put them in very easily not having used Perfect Locks before. Thank you for making this purchase so easy and for an amazing product that’s given me my self confidence back.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My experience here was pleasant. I went in not knowing much and had a nice conversation with one of the reps Marie. She took her time explaining different options to me, she didn’t pressure me at all. I’m planning to make my first purchase after talking to my stylist.< /text>

< Review>
I purchased Perfect Locks hair. At first I loved it but soon realized that it is over priced and is very difficult to manage! I bought this hair based on how it was advertised as "real  human hair" unlike all the other hair that is cheaper. My hair became very dry  frizzy, and very hard to manage even with the recommended hair care products that Perfect Lock suggested, I still had problems with controlling the hair. I would have been better off to buy cheaper hair because I experienced the same thing with this hair . It is highly over priced and over rated. You better off with buying a cheaper quality of hair and save yourself some trouble and money is my true!< /Review>

The hair was absolutely terrible.  I ordered a 22inch curly, it didn’t look 22 inche,s, it looked more like 18 and when blow drying my hair straight at the hair salon the hair dresser agreed the ends were so bad I’d have to cut 5 inches for the hair to look healthy straight and not damage.  I will not be buying from this company.  Was not good quality and if you want a 20 inch buy 28inches because the hair is very stringy and requires a good cut before this looks healthy.</review>

{'time': 1569974545218, 'text': "Dear Erida,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your experience. We at Perfect Locks have a very flexible 14-day return policy. We ask that all customers inspect the hair thoroughly upon receipt. we ask customers to wash, condition, style, and in your case, measure the hair while in the security zip ties. We hope that all customers ensure the hair meets their expectations before installation. Real Remy human hair is an investment, and also has certain characteristics. Our hair is single drawn, which means the ends are left natural and will have variation. It allows our customers the flexibility of leaving the ends for a natural look or trimming them to achieve a particular style. If there was the slightest concern with length, we would have advised to immediately contact us so we can resolve the issue. Unfortunately, after the hair is installed we are limited on what we can do to help. I'm not sure what product was used on the hair prior, but usually adding some leave-in conditioner and scrunching the ends can help moisturize and add fullness to the ends."}<//Resp>

Well I was told 100.00 for coloring my unit but after Brittany came back from speaking with Nick it was 250.00. I thought that was very high to ombre my unit I just invested in for 500.00 just 9 days ago. Thank you Brittany for your professional support and helpful advice on maintaining the Indian curl pattern but I feel if you miss quote a customer ,it should be honored.  Especially loyal clientele. Nick is also very nice. The entire staff is very nice.</Text>

The initial price was an estimate, once the stylist took a look at the hairstyle you were trying to achieve it was clear there was more color and complexity involved... Hence, the reason for the price to change. We did honor a discount for you during that time and you seemed to be fine with the resolution. Thank you for your comments about your interaction with Brittany, it's surely helpful and we will pass on your feedback to her."}<//response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Perfect Locks is my favorite place in SF to get hair extensions! The hair quality is great, the store is clean and well designed, and I’ve never left not satisfied with my experience. Because of the way the store is setup, it’s easy to see all the different types of hair they have to offer. Maia and Katelyn are so helpful and educated on what they’re selling, and they’ll walk you through exactly what kind of hair you need for the style you want and how to maintain it. Try Perfect Locks out, you’ll never want to go anywhere else again!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

So glad I found this place. I’ve tried many brands… This is by far the most authentic hair out there. I maintain it with their Inspire hair care line and it’s just perfect. Let me start off by saying the customer service is amazing. At my request, they sent me photos of the hair they were sending out. I wanted to make sure it was a perfect color and texture match. And it was! I felt like I was being annoying but they totally helped me through the process and made me feel good about it. Then, they helped me sort out a shipping issue (not their fault). I was floored after I got the hair. It’s just beautiful! I’ve been using tape-ins for a while but thought I would try a partial sew-in this time. The weave hair is gorgeous and blends perfectly with my own hair. I’ve had it in for about 3 weeks now. So glad I found this company! Thanks.</Text>

<Text>My girlfriend and I were looking for some good quality extensions and I happen to bump into this online store. The website is super impressive and I saw they cater to some celebs too. Gave it a shot and I am so happy with my choice. Got a perfect set of extensions which match my color and texture. Only negative is I was expecting more hair in one bundle but I guess everything is clearly mentioned in the description which I missed. So had to order another set. Would recommend to read the description, their return policy, and also call if you have doubts about how much is needed. It really helps talking to a real person.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I’m a hairstylist working out of a high-end Manhattan salon and after 16 years in this business, I have found that the PerfectLocks Hair quality and customer service are absolutely the best. I don’t live in California but when I work on the phone with the staff at PerfectLocks they treat me as if I am there number one priority. The hair quality is exceptional. It lasts longer than any other hair I have used for my clients.  The curly hair is our favorite because the virgin curly is so incredibly beautiful and natural looking. The wigs are durable the hair pieces are flawless and I will be ordering from this company for many years to come. Thank you PerfectLocks for your amazing hard work.</Review>

<text>I always liked their product although since they moved to Walnut Creek they have price increases that theme a bit above normal increase that I assume that they're moving new Elegance tile showroom has costumes quite a bit of overhead therefore it's passed to the customer and the fact that they moved to upscale beat Walnut Creek from less Savvy Concord, so put it short when you move to where the wrong with are you live like the Romans in charge like the rhombus can afford that was the whole point in moving right ? But inspite of all that stuff they have the best products I have bought myself, are they still get 5 Stars from me....<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80855e48fb17bd3f:0xe97a5162eb67de32</Gmap_id></record>

The best place for beautiful, quality hair. I'm a customer for life. I've lived in the bay all my life and this is by FAR my favorite store to purchase bundles and wigs! I'm so grateful for this place because I don't have to order online anymore! Thanks Perfect Locks!<//review>

<review>I’ve been a hair stylist for 20 years, tried every brand out there. I do use other brands, but if one of my clients is looking to invest and wants the best Remy hair available, I recommend Perfect Locks.

Been shopping here for years. I recently got 3 bundles of curly hair and it's still so soft and beautiful after 6 months. I plan to take it down and install wavy hair I bought from them 2 years ago! Unbelievable experience every time! I've tried every hair shop in the Bay, but not anymore. The people here are always very nice and professional. Customer for life!<//review>

Thanks for wonderful product, I use your hair care line on my natural straightish wavy hair as I'm Bangladeshi mixed, it makes my natural hair so bouncy, shiny and beautiful, smells amazing with the orange cream scent!, I'll always use your hair care line on my natural hair and my older sister Sonia has a hair salon on the side of her mainstream engineering job, she orders and uses your hair extensions and hair product from you guys and loves, love you guys, however I don't use your actual extensions, my natural hair is type 2a, 2b and mid thigh length< /text>

After installing 3 of the 4 packs of hair extensions on my client on June 15th, 2018, she returned just over a week later to have them removed due to the hair discoloring from blonde to orange. My client has been getting hair extensions from me for years, and we have never had this problem before with other hair extension brands. I contacted Perfect Locks on June 27th, 2018 via phone and e-mail to explain the problem, and they requested I return the 4 packs of hair extensions so they could examine them to see what went wrong. I returned the extensions to Perfect Locks on 7/2/2018 using the shipping label they provided me. In the meantime, I had to purchase new hair extensions from my previous local supplier, and install new hair extensions on my client which cost me $325 for the new hair extensions and $200 for my labor, all of which I had to comp the client. A representative with Perfect Locks contacted me via phone on July 12th, 2018 and told me that upon their examination of the hair I had returned to them, they had concurred that they had sent me an old batch of hair and would resend me 3 new packs of hair and only refund me for the 1 unused and unopened pack of hair. I told them that I would not accept their offer since I had already lost $525 for my labor and the purchase of new hair extensions to fix the problem they had caused. I explained that I expected a full refund for the defective hair extensions that I had returned to them and the membership fee. The representative then told me she would discuss the issue with her manager and get back to me. I have not heard back from them and I am now in the process of trying to complete a charge-back with my bank.<//Review><Name>Heather P.< /Name></record></dataset><record>

I'm so disappointed with this product I got the platinum blonde extensions within a month they were dry, frizzy, and out of control. The extentions looked totally fake and turned into a rat's nest. My salon stylist said they were the worst extentions he's ever seen, extremely over processed. They're customer service is even WORSE Brittini could care less she sold me a terrible product. Could care less I spent $250 on hair extentions I used for less than a month. I URGE people not to buy this product and go with another brand. They fooled me I hope they dont fool anyone else. Needless to say I will never buy ANYTHING from this company again.</Text>

<response>{'time': 1569957798531, 'text': "Dear Jennifer,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your experience with your purchase. As our hair is natural Remy human hair, care and maintenance is very important. Using the right products can have a dramatic positive impact on your experience, using products that lock in moisture and hydrate the hair is key. Brittni was handling your issue, she was recommending certain products for you to use and even recommended we send out a complimentary set of sulfate-free hair care products and loop brush for extensions. We hope that customers are open enough to try our recommendations, taming human hair can rarely be frustrating... However, the results can be dramatic and impressive... When you ultimately fall in love with your hair. If customers are not open to working with suggestions from our experienced customer service team, there is little we can do to help. Sorry it didn't work out for you,."}</response><Gmap_id>0x80855e48fb17bd3f:0xe97a5162eb67de32<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>I ordered my 'Perfect Locks' straight virgin remy hair about a month ago.  I was extremely excited to recieve my purchase since I had read a lot of glowing reviews.  I had researched many hair companies because I wanted to ensure that I was well informed because this was an investment for me. I am ecstatic to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the customer service I received and the quality of the hair.  I will be a 'perfect locks ' customer for life.  My hairdresser was also pleased with the quality of the hair stating "this is premium virgin remy hair, it should hold well for a long while".  I am very pleased with MY perfect locks

After the extensions that I purchased in April of this year began shedding terribly, I emailed the company and the customer service rep told me the amount of shedding was “normal” it wasn’t. The extensions literally fell apart in my head. After 2 months, countless emails and 5 Pictures to explain to the same rep I originally messaged the issue today I was asked to provide more pictures and explanation. I have told so many people about this company because before this experience I loved the extensions but unfortunately the quality of the extensions is not the same and the customer service I received was terrible.

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Sketchers is one of the best store in USA. I visited many times in this store because of its perfect location , reasonable price and variety. I bought women shoes for my family. They like this brand because of good quality shoe stuff . Shoes are light weight this is also the main reason for women to visit this store. It is located inside great mall . You can get special offers on Mother’s Day, Black Friday, Father’s Day.  Actually 50% discount you can get on 2nd if you buy 2 pairs. Thank you 😊<//text>< pictures>

Friendly staff.  He offered to look up a shoe size to ship it to me for free.  Also informed me 2nd pair would be 1/2 off if I chose to get another pair.<//Text>

<text>I come by store last month. My cousin and I went to hooters and remember the girl we ask helped from Monique wearing a cropped top and was on top of the ladder putting shoes we can see her bra under the ladder. My cousin asked her for help and I find it distasteful that the girl was almost showing her body. And another girl i think latina wearing tight leggings sitting with her legs wide open.You should be selling shoes and not loook prostitute. We ask for her name and has a bit of attitude. If you like prostitute like girls come here shoes is just plus. Made the shoes look cheap cause the girls are like hooters.<//text>< Pics>

I spend more than $300 per year in this brand.
My last visit in this store was terrible. I tried to explain the problem with my shoes and just wanted to exchange the right one but they just ignore me. Awful customer service!</text>

Very unhappy with the shift manager Monique. When i got at the store @8:15 he metal fence was half way closed .At 8:20 pm the manager came over to tell me they are closing in 20 min ( they supposed to work until 9 pm)  they closed completely @8:30 pm
I asked her for a certain size she told me right away she does not have it. Did not bother even to check. I asked another girl and she was able to find it in the back. When i finished the with the purchase I explained​ to her what bothered me and instead of understanding she got rude, ignorant and defencive.insisting she did not do anything wrong. The other two employees were pretty nice.</text>

Racist staff. Rude manager asking me if it was my mess for somebody else,s boxes. Going to report these guys to BBB. All piece of junk staff here need to be fired sketchers if you are listening. Sketchers you will soon have a lawsuit on your hands if you treat pregnant women like this. Avoid this piece of junk store for the staff. Not sure if these guys are even trained by sketchers to treat customers respectfully. We were told that they are looking forward to read my review here.< /text>

Very rude staff. Monique the manager is even worse. Not a welcoming place. We pay them but it seems like they are doing us a favor. Never going there again.<//Text>

They really helped me out!! Was traveling on Christmas Eve. I live out of the area and got a low tire pressure alert. They had me come in right away, just after noon. They got the nail out so I felt safe driving the next 3 hours through the mountains. Thanks guys!!< /review>

Very good service, family owned and operated. McGuire construction only went to Schoettler to service our company trucks and trailers as well as our personal vehicles. McGuires only recommend Schoettler to friends and family in Madera. Very pleased by all the men there, very efficient men, high quality. You cannot find better service in Madera!<//Review>

This is a great local mom n pop shop, second generation family running it, great service. I've been doing business with them since the 80s. Free tire rotation for the life of your tires you buy from them. If they don't have a answer for your question they will get one. Highly recommend them.<//Review>

They rotated the tires on my RV but in doing they changed the rotation of the tire and the next time I took the RV out, the tire failed. I really think if they would have taken the time to dismount the tire from the rim and keep in the same side of the vehicle the tire would not have immediately failed.<//Text>

Had a shaky ride.  Brought the car in to Schoettler on a recommendation and they had it fixed in less than an hour.  And because it was a minor fix, they did it at no charge.< /Review>

<text>This is the best dentist I’ve been to in high desert. I had upper and lower teeth pulled without pain as well as fillings during the same visit. The office is very clean and updated and the staff behind the counter is great!  10/10. The girl who did my X-rays was bomb and whoever cleaned my teeth was bomb af!!! Thank you!< /text>< username>

<review>Well I had 9 teeth removed and I was scared but they assured me I would be fine and they were right never felt anything except the shots.  He was very gentle and super fast.

Check in process is super easy and quick. They take your temperature right away, and I was called in for my app shortly after. They are detailed and make sure your comfortable. They do amazing work. So happy I found them.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I have been a patient for just over one year. I’ll admit firsthand that I had seen a dentist in over 30 years, before I had come to take my grandson’s to their check up. They were very excited about going, something I couldn’t say about my childhood dentist. Fast forward to my first appointment. I confessed to the DH that I was petrified already and we were just taking X-rays. The event was painless and actually pretty cool that I could see immediately on the screen. Needless to say they’re some cavities that had to be addressed. Dr listened to my quick story of my dentist what was said and done. He promised that the second anything scared me or hurt that I was just to raise my hand and he’d stop. Nothing happened with this appointment yet set up for a few up coming appointments to start saving the worst three teeth. Very patient and I have zero complaints to say. Even my grandkids what toy I got. Mmm no toys for adults....<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Ever since I've been going to Dr. Jang I've always had pleasant experiences.  I am deathly afraid of the dentist and he makes it easy for me.  I have complete confidence in him and his staff.  Best dentist in Barstow for sure.< /text>

New location beautifully decorated. The interior is peaceful and calm. Very clean and spacious. The staff everyone there are all super friendly. Kid friendly. I especially like that no matter who your being assisted by they guide and walk you through what to expect. Ex:  you may feel a little pinch or you might feel a little pressure. Helps keep you calm. Great service  all the time. Typically there very prompt but there can be a little wait every now again which is expected. I definitely recommend them if your looking for great quality and service.< /review>

<Text>Dr Jang’s dentistry is the best thing that has happened to me. The front office and all the staff workers in the back are the most polite, friendly and professional people you could ask for when you are in need of being calmed down before having their teeth worked on. Dr. Jang is the most gentle dentist I have ever been to. His hands are a work of art when it comes to helping his patients. Thank you</Text>< Pics>

Best dentist I have ever encountered! I have gotten my braces from Dr. Jang and he is one of the few conservative type of dentists you will rarely find these days. His focus is more on preserving teeth and doing only whats really needed. Many dentists will do recommend to extract teeth prior installing braces and start with thicker wires to get the job done quickly, which involves pain and other side effects. He is very caring and has knowledge about what he is doing. I am very happy and satisfied with the services I had so far.</Review>

{'time': 1610221595235, 'text': "Sorry about what happened to you mom! I didn't know I can reply to the reviews until today. Sorry about late reply too.\nFor the Dentures, Adjustment is most important procedures. So, after we deliver the denture, patient has to come in every week for adjustment. We make three (3) mandatory adjustment appointments. With those appointments, we mostly can make denture to fit well. However, many times you need more adjustments, so we tell our patient to call and make an appointment whenever they feel pain or any problem exist. So we do the adjustment up to 6month at no charge. That is our police about denture adjustment. If there is sore spot, it won't go away not until we adjust that spot. That is why you have to make sure to come in if there is any sore spot or pain.\nMaking a denture is not a easy procedure. And we try to take enough time to make them. That is why some dentist doesn't even make a denture. Every patient has different bone ridge shape, you cannot expect same outcome with your friend who has a denture and can function very well. But we try our best to make a best denture with different situation that patient has. Sometimes we even have to start over if we think the denture is not working very well. We explain to the lab and if they agree with us, we make a new one at no charge. so if you have any problem you have to make sure to call us within 6 month.\nOur staff knows denture policy very well. However sometimes, lack of communication can cause problems. Maybe we didn't inform you well. Sorry  about anything that made you unhappy. Please call us if there is anything we can help.\nThank You."}</Response>

Went in got my teeth pulled and had dentures made. They didn't even come close to fitting in my mouth. Went back several more times but they still never got close to fitting in my mouth. Then I'm told come back in a year cuz medical will only pay for u to come in 3 times for denture work. So I had to report them. When I reported them I was sent to another dentist to see if my dentures could be fixed. They told medical that they're so messed up that I needed a whole new set made. Dr. Hangs office also didn't seem to care that 2 of the teeth were cracked when they gave them to me. All they could say was when u come back in a year we will do something about that too. Wrong answer. I didn't go back and I never will. If u need dentures DON'T go there they don't care about people who are on medical. If u have any other insurance be careful too. My friends husband went here and they charged him and the insurance company so they could get paid twice for the same set and he had to fix his dentures himself cuz they wouldn't do it.<//Text>

The reviews are true!! This place is awesome. I normally don’t like going to the dentist. But the staff made me feel very welcome. They treat you as regular person, make conversation with you. Very friendly, relatable and a relaxed, fun environment. I had my first appointment there and Dr. Sako made it so fun - all while still the business we’re there to do! I can’t wait to go back and recommend everyone to switch to Dental Design Studio City!!< /text>

Truly an exquisite dental studio.  The rooms are neat and clean. The Doctors are accommodating, knowledgeable and willing to work with you. The Office staff is just as wonderful.  My teeth were cleaned, X-rays were taken and a consult was done for veneers, and Invisalign.  I love the path we chose and can't wait for amazing results.< /review>

They are very personal, knowledgable, and energetic. I was impressed with how thorough each individual is and how they work seamlessly as a team. Grateful always to find a doctor and office that  I look forward to seeing and feel confident that I am in good hands.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Rating>5< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

Super happy with my experience at Dental Design Studio City. Everyone from the front desk to assistants were very welcoming. Dr. Sako is a friendly, down-to-earth guy and made me feel taken care of from the jump. The atmosphere is upbeat and fun, they played music during my procedure that helped me relax and never lost professionalism. They also presented a range of treatment options and were transparent with payment plans for each. I'd definitely recommend Dental Design Studio City to any LA/SFV resident in the market for a new dentist!</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Last week, I went to Dental Design for a cleaning (my teeth definitely needed it). Every stain on my teeth—and there were lots of them (I drink lots of coffee and tea)—was completely removed. I was so impressed. And now today, I had a filling put in by Dr. Sako and it was, quite possibly, the best filling experience I’ve ever had. Who even has good filling experiences?! This guy right here, apparently! Dental Design is the best! I recommend to all. Oh, and the entire staff is so polite and super capable. The whole experience is A+!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I had to change dentists since my previous dentist was no longer going to accept my dental insurance starting in 2021.   I found Dental Design on my dental insurance’s website.  Starting with my first call to the office including my first visit, this was probably the most amazing experience at a dental office I’ve ever had.  Dr. Sako Karakozian and his entire team were extremely courteous, caring, helpful and informative.  I couldn’t be more pleased.  Thank you all so much!<//text>

I had such an amazing experience at dental design studio city. Everyone that worked there was so kind and helpful. All of their equipment is high-tech and up-to-date. The staff was very professional and also made me feel comfortable. Going to the dentist is always a stressful experience and I want to thank the doctor and the rest of the staff for making that experience easy.I will be a long time patient.< /Review>

Wow, another fantastic experience with Doctor Taline!  Every time! The staff is incredible, Randi and all staff are the best. Careful care, friendly and professional, all COVID-safe. Dr. Taline had to do a complicated fix inside my crown-implant and SUPER fixed - no replacement crown and WOW. Magic-< /review>

Great staff, and very professional. I'm a registered dental assistant myself, and I tend to be pretty picky about where I get my dental work done. The Hygienist Jenny at this office is awesome! She's gentle and thorough. Dr. Sako is so nice and informative. He is GREAT at what he does, and he helped me feel very comfortable there, even during this Covid time. The office environment is really cool too, with lots of neat art and antiques that can help distract you. I highly recommend getting your dental work done at this office. 5 STARS!!! :)<//text>

I received a thorough but gentle cleaning with all the latest technology, and consultation with Dr. Sako who is very detailed and super friendly.  He followed up with text about a product he mentioned for me.  I love this place.</Review>

Had an amazing experience with Dr. Taline and the team. Appointments were easy to schedule and quick to get in, staff was incredibly friendly and made sure I was comfortable (especially with all of the covid madness). Every question was answered and they explained all of my options clearly - I'm so happy with the experience and would recommend to anyone I know. Also - solid music playlist ;)< /Review>

I don't usually leave reviews, but after my experience with Dental Design Studio City and Dr. Taline, they deserve one. I have been avoiding the dentist during Covid because it seems so scary not wearing a mask in an office with other people. After cracking my tooth I had no choice. My regular dentist wasn't available. Dental Design said they weren't taking on new clients, but if it was an emergency to leave a message. To my surprise within the hours I was contacted by their office with helpful tips and solutions. They were closed over the weekend, but said they'd have the office manager call me when they were open. I got a call and they squeezed me in right away. I could not believe the kindness and the thoroughness they displayed. I was super nervous going and from the moment I got there, they had strict protocols in place and did everything to make sure I felt safe. Dr Taline was so kind and thorough, she even reached out and got me an appt with a periodontist, the same day. She didn't want to do any unnecessary, painful or costly work. She also followed up right after that appt making sure that I was ok and helped guide me in the next steps to fix my tooth. I highly recommend Dr. Taline and her staff/office. They make going to the dentist not painful at all! I look forward to going back there and getting my mouth fixed right.< /text>

It had been a while since I'd been to the dentist -- I know three people who actually love going to the dentists and two of them are dentists themselves -- but any fears or reservations that I had when I walked in melted within the first few minutes. On the personal side, everyone on the staff was friendly and professional. Y'know. Like they wanted to be there and beyond that, like they wanted ME to be there. Such a comfort. Beyond the personal side, the office was clean and organized. And it's clear that that's not just because of COVID. Speaking of, I don't know what any of their smiles look like because they were all in masks. (Although all of their eyes smile.) Safety first! There was sanitizer and temperature check as well. The equipment was state-of-the-art and they were really good at bridging the gap between what I didn't know and what they did. So glad that this place was covered by my insurance.

Beyond the office staff, they have their own staff of knowledgeable and dedicated oral surgeons. I have no issues recommending this place.< /text>

Honestly one of the best dental offices we have ever been to. They were able to get me in last minute for a broken wire retainer, and they have taken great care of my husband who needs to have his veneers replaced. Great attitudes and cool vibe in this office !</Review>

<Text>Everyone here is so friendly and careful. They take time to explain every step of every action to you. They’re also very good at preparing the best plan for your dental care, but not pressuring you to commit to anything you’re not ready for. They really understand that your time (for appointments) and money are limited resources.

They are extremely busy, but I have found that Dr. Sako ensures that he gives each patient appropriate time and attention.

I only recently moved to LA, and I feel like I really lucked out finding the best dentist with the best staff.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Also love that they let you watch Netflix or listen to music while you get your procedures done. Overall a wonderful experience and looking forward to my next appointment!

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>It had been 5 years since I went to the dentist and the lovely people at Dental Design were sensitive and kind about where my teeth and gums needed some work after my years of neglect and gave me several options on how to move forward. All of my xrays were done with the best technology and they run the office so efficiently I was never left waiting wondering what was going on, and if I was waiting for just a moment they put Netflix on so that I could watch it while they cleaned my gums! Seriously better than anything I could have expected especially since I was worried about judgment for not getting a cleaning in so long. I recommend Dental Design to anyone who feels like they have put going off to the dentist for too long and needs a helpful guide, as well as people who are on top of their dental hygiene and want the best of the best to maintain it!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2bdfb0bcb1b73:0x2512a915a27f684b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It’s always hard to find a credible, knowledgeable and amazing dentist anywhere let alone in the greater LA area. If you are looking for a dentist- this is your place. The staff and facilities alone will make your experience worthwhile. I mean where can you watch game of thrones and play duck hunt while you get your teeth examined! Dr. Sako is your man. Perfect location. 👍<//Review>

<Review>First time going today everyone was extremely nice, honest, and on time.

I've been to many places that were unprofessional here in Los Angeles but this  place definitely beats them all.

<Text>I've been with the same dentist/hygienist for almost 19 years so switching due to insurance coverage was a scary thought.  Dr. Sako and his team are welcoming, comforting and excellent at what they do.  Thank you!<//Text>< Pics>

Best dentist! High level of attention to detail, wonderful drill-side mannor, amazing front desk staff.

Clean facilities —they validate for parking PLUS you can get a great car wash while getting your teeth “washed” 😜< /text>

Dr Taline is more like a friend than a dentist while being an amazing great dentist! How is this possible ? I have a phobia of dentists yet here I am, LOVING my dentist! Painless and non judgmental , she works really hard to make your issue as affordable as possible while also giving you best outcome. Her staff is amazing and don’t be surprised if after your visit , while she’s home
With her kids, even at dinner time, you get a No Caller ID call and it is Dr Taline checking on you.. yes! I had failed implant holding in a four toothe bridge on my bottom front teethe and implant saved, new teethe on the way and my temporaries is are awesome.</review>

<Review>The office staff are super friendly and they took the most sophisticated x-rays I've ever had.  Dr. Taline is great, really knowledgable and thorough in explaining all of the details related to any procedure you might have done.  So far I've just had an initial visit and x-rays, but I am very happy.  I had a couple questions after I left and Dr. Taline answered my email right away.<//Review>< pics>

Dr. Sako and his staff do a great job. Everyone is happy and it shows. I had an extremely bad experience with another dentist (he ultimately had his license revoked) about 20 years ago and have been reticent to visit the dentist. He and his staff have gone out of their way to make sure I am confortable during my visits.<//review>

The most caring, knowledgable and hospitable staff. Great work at a  value. Great attention to detail. I hate going to the dentist, but love my dentist!!!!! Dr. Sako is great.

Super easy complementary valet parking (they'll even wash your car while you're getting your dental work done).< /Review>

Waited to review because sometimes care declines over time, but not here!! I am a very finicky patient and the one thing I didn't want was to remove my wisdom teeth. I ended up trusting them to remove all 4 of mine and all my problems were alleviated after. On top of that, the office staff is top notch and seems to genuinely care. I tell everyone I know about Dr. Sako, the first dentist to win my trust!< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Dr. Sako, Dr. Taline, and their staff are all so amazing. Everyone here is always very accomodating and knowledgeable. It’s always a great experience at DDSC and we no longer develop that uneasy feeling knowing it’s that time of the year for our checkups. Taking x-rays are always painless and I was able to view my teeth right from my dental chair. Dr. Sako is so wonderful and made my teeth look exactly how I wanted. He goes above and beyond in expectations. They also provide a personal monitor inside every room which keeps you entertained. My son had a blast playing old school Nintendo while there for his teeth cleaning. We also had all four of his wisdom teeth removed over the summer and it couldn’t have been a smoother experience. Not to mention, the interior decor is very hip and there are several amazing contemporary art pieces to check out. It feels like a mini art gallery. So grateful for this wonderful establishment for me and my family. Always a five star experience!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bdfb0bcb1b73:0x2512a915a27f684b< /Gmap_id><user_name>angie king<//user_name>< response>

I hate dental visits or rather I did. I suffer from severe anxiety and  the thought of a needle coming at my face is not exactly my idea of a good time. However, I don't go into a complete panic attack anymore since Dr. Sako has been my dentist (he does this really cool pinch and jiggle thing on my cheek if I need an injection LOL). 12 years have passed and since he has relocated to Studio City, California - I actually travel all the way from Vegas for my dental work.
On the office- Super hip, trendy, and fun. My dental kit even came with a smiley pin. (LOVED THIS)
On the office staff-
Rene is so amazing and wonderful. He always makes me laugh, before I even get in the chair and I don't feel like I'm dealing with a used car salesmen when it comes to payment.
Daisy is super friendly and even showed me what all the tools are before they went into my mouth (Insert all your dental joke here..) As funny as this is, it's another amazing reason why I feel so much more comfortable at this office than I ever have before.
Eric- where do I start with this guy. He has this awesome LED scrolling name tag and is super amazing with X rays. I have a horrible gag reflex (keep the dental jokes coming guys.) He's super fast with X-rays and again, is another easily apparent reason why I choose to stay with Dr. Sako.
Randi is the office manager and a pitbull with the insurance companies and paper work. I imagine she is the reason the office runs so smoothly and I actually get to enjoy all my insurance dental benefits.
Dr. Taline I've only met a few times in passing, as she is not my dentist but the lady has an amazing smile and insanely pretty. She's said hi to me every time I've ever seen her.

For those of you wondering. I did try to find a local dentist office in Vegas. This resulted in taking the dentist 2 days to pull out a tooth. It damn near undid everything Dr. Sako has done over the past 12 years to keep me calm in a dental chair. I literally cried and did have a full on panic attack my 2nd day. This is exactly why people fear dentists. Save yourself some grief and just go see Dr. Sako. He's worth traveling for.</review>

< Review>
Dr. Taline is absolutely AMAZING, and I can’t say it enough. I let my fear of the dentist hold me back for years, but now I will never be nervous to go again, as long as it’s with Dr. Taline and her team. Their services are professional and overall, a relaxed experience — the staff just tops it off! The team is so kind, understanding, and genuinely compassionate.

Dental Design makes communication with their patients a top priority, and it goes such a long way.  I couldn’t be happier with my results. You’ll never be afraid of the dentist again after a visit with Dr. Taline — after spending several weekends in a row with her and her team, I can personally assure it. Thank you for everything, Dr. Taline!</Review>

Background Info:
Phobia of injectables. Had extensive dentistry experiences during my 50 years. Don't write reviews and/or testimonials unless the business/person is deserving of same. Visiting the USA (from Australia).

My Experience:
During my vacation in the USA, I experienced a toothache due to a cracked filling and associated infection. Pain, head throbbing and lack of sleep forced me to investigate dental options. From my first point of contact (with Miss V of the Dental Design Studio City "DDSC") to the repaired tooth, the service was second-to-none. Doc Sako and his competent team took fantastic care of me, my dentistry needs including my needle phobia. In essence, the DDSC team only cared about me. Sure, the service was outstanding, the practice was very well appointed, the paperwork was made easy due to the technological tools on hand, BUT, this means nothing unless your specific needs are addressed, and the Doc Sako and the entire DDSC team excelled in this area.

In Summary:
If you have a fear of injectables/drills/the dentist chair, or, want to experience a top shelf dentist service, undertaken by consummate professionals, STOP SEARCHING and call or email the DDSC team like I did - you won't regret the decision!<//Review>

The employees at Best Buy were very knowledgable and friendly. They took the time To explain to me about the products I was interested in. I feel like they Had my best Interest in mind,  Very ethical and dedicated to their job. I would definitely recommend Making best by your number one choice for Buying electronics and Getting any problem you have with anything electronic taking care of. Thank you Best Buy for You going above and beyond everyone else.</text>

< Review>
I'm old fashioned ... Grew up with the Good Guys and Circuit City ...and like to buy things from a store. Best Buy is one of those stores I can spend hours in... It's pretty obvious the internet has taken over...in store stock is low and the reps are not very helpful... That being said Best Buy is the only electrics store that is still around and I can still spend hours there</Review>

<Review>This has to be one of the worst Best Buys around. I go there cause it is the nearest to my house and never have a felt I was welcomed or cared for. I always get profiled at Magnolia no matter how much I tell them I need a high-end TV. The merchandise is over-stuffed throughout the entire store. And when I do manage to get some help from some representative, I end up telling them about what's great about a particular model. I guess this is why you check out the product at Best Buy and then buy online.</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< Rating>

I am annoyed with the store I bought a photographic lens they gave me a day and hour of delivery, but I arrived at the store and the employee only answered that my product had not arrived yet, I asked him to give me a day and hour to pick up what I bought and  He in a very curt way told me - come back another day maybe tomorrow!  my annoyance is: 1. they do not deliver things on time and 2. why they are not friendly and do not give an exact date of when things will be delivered!  I'm wasting my time 😤🤷< /review>

This Best Buy has been here for years and the customer service has always been inconsistent. This time around isn't any different. There's only one employee per work area and if they're busy, good luck trying to find someone else who isn't on the floor talking to an employee and not doing their job.<//review>

<Review>The staff in the computer (desktop, laptop, tablets) department is phenomenal: knowledgeable, patient, and helpful to my decision making. Yesterday I threw a curve ball to Samuel about cameras, as I process dense raw files on my desktop, and he was equally knowledgeable. Later I called to refine a tablet purchase, and the gentleman I spoke to helped me solidify my choices.  Earlier this spring I purchased 2 tablets and 2 styluses. They were also efficient and knowledgeable then too.  Really a fantastic place with exceptional staff!</Review><gmap_id>0x808fa2159f5f4cd1:0x398b3a1d4d9638f2</gmap_id><Response>None<//Response>< rate>

<Text>It was o.k.  My nephew took me there!
He bought me a 40 inch, smart, Samsung, flat screen t.v.  that had no box, no remote, instructions, manuel or power cord.
I was kinda surprise they didn't try to make the deal sweeter! It was marked down 50.00 bucks already and he tried to chew them down further, but no luck.
We did get a remote from the guy and I had a power cord from the samsung at my place that we were replacing.  being replaced.
The sales employee I  was asking said,  "there were no open box, smart t.v.'s in  the store!"
If my nephew was a female, I'm sure the sales guys would have told him the same thing, "no open box flat screens in the store.".
Do they work on commission?
Sure were acting like it.<//Text>< Pictures>

A good Best Buy as most of the others. A LOT of products in a huge store, with great prices. The people working there need to be called to help you, but their help is really good. They were not pushy to make you buy products, at least with me. Once I decided what I wanted to buy, they got me the product and the payment was smooth. The refund policy is great, if you didn't like the product you can get it no questions asked.<//Review>

I was also asked if I needed help with what I was looking for, which I did, and a sales associate came to the door right away and took me to the things I was looking for to help me, which was very helpful. If I had any suggestion, it might be to have the person at the door do temperature checks also, but overall my experience there today was excellent.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>I went looking for the brand new Animal Crossing Switch console and sadly they no longer had any to sell. The staff were very communicative and helpful making sure I knew what they had in stock and what they didn’t have. Even though I was sad about not finding the switch I wanted I left happy knowing that staff helped me and were attentive to what I was asking about. Always a great experience with staff at this Best Buy location. Definitely prefer it more than other Bay Area Best Buy locations!</Text><name>Melissa Navas< /name>< Response>

<text>Good selection of electronic appliances, found basic machines for daily life and entertainment systems as well. There were also many items on discount or on sale which very much piqued my interest in said items. For example, the gaining isles were filled with new and slightly older games, and the older games were rightfully discounted to mostly 1/3 it's original price. A stellar deal if I say so myself. Overall, cool place.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Don’t ever go to Best Buy for a auto stereo install.  First I had to wait a month for the first available appt.  then on my install day the Installer called in sick.  Then I had to wait another week just to find out they can’t install my speakers.  What a joke!!! Never again< /Text>

<text>Salesman in computers lied about windows 10s saying I have to pay an additional 50 dollars to unlock windows 10 full features in order to try to make me spend 400 more on a different laptop. Glad I didn't do so.

Appliances are amazing and the salesman there was honest and truthful and got him a sale from us.

Overall subtracting 2 stars because the majority of workers are dishonest and/or not knowledgeable about their assigned department, at least from my interactions with them.< /text>< Rate>

<review>Great for electronics you need right away / same day. Beware! Was really disappointed to see prices higher in the store than online. Very bizarre. Make sure to check the online prices and if higher in the store, they will match but had to stand in a special customer service line 🤔  Crazy in the age of Amazon that they would do this.</review><user_id>115945255347960076242<//user_id><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

They have staff that could answer your questions regarding a product your interested in purchasing. Their location is good too. There are other shops near it & there's also a Mexican restaurant & Starbucks near it.
This is the closest branch if you live in San Mateo, Belmont, San Carlos, Redwood Shores & Redwood City.</text>

<rating>2< /rating><text>I scheduled an appointment with Geek Squad a week ahead of time for an iPhone X battery replacement. When it finally came time for the repair and after waiting in the store about 15-30 mins (after cleaning the phone, entering info, prepping and etc) it was finally revealed that they didn't have all the necessary parts. The person there told me call in a few days to see if they had the parts first before setting up an appointment.

I have called now 5 times (1 time a few days ago, 4 times today since I had more time to waste). Every single time when I navigate through their phone menu which takes about 1.5-2min, and even then, it just rings off the hook until maybe 30s-1min later I get hung up on. This was a very frustrating experience.

Bump to 2 stars since a very helpful person on a different side of the store was able to assist out; I was able to get through to them (via Sales) and they went through the effort to manually walk over and check with Geek Squad to see what the issue was. Could be a management issue, but it turned out that they have been too busy (maybe understaffed). Either way, a bad customer experience.</text>< Pictures>

Needed a printer.

There were no sales associates who approached me during the 10 minutes I spent reviewing the selection.

Most major brands. Selected a Brother printer.

Went to the cashier. Thankful no extended warranty were offered. Paid showed the front security my receipt and left.< /Review>

My overall experience with Best buy has been good the staff are knowledgeable The geek squad agents are honest and help you fix your products another thing I like about Best buy is they have a lot of stuff in one place for example they have magnolia home theater center they also have Pacific sales which has big and small electronics and home design most Best buys have an auto installation center where you can get a car stereo installed when you buy one from store or if you bring one in they even have an AT&t Booth that sells phone plans and new phones they often are pretty easy on returns if you have a receipt if you don't they can look it up through your card I do like that they offer accidental protection plans on most of consumer electronics however some electronics do not qualify.</Text>

< review>
Went in looking for a TV. The guy who helped me was great. Super helpful and knowledgeable. I'm a but picky with tech and he went above and beyond to try to find a deal for me. Ended up ordering 1 of the 2 tvs I wanted but will be going back in a couple weeks for the second because of this guy. Generally not a big fan of big box stores but some of the employees can really make it an awesome experience.</review>

Be careful and watch your reward certificates. They expire fast, like less than two months after you earned them and a month after you are notified how much you have. I feel like I was robbed of the $35.00 I earned.</review>

<review>Started with ample parking.   Inside,  the store is clean and spacious.   The overhead signs are all easy to read, so it's easy to find the department you want.   Plenty of employees.  When there was a customer looking for help,  a quick message on a radio brought someone into the area.  My employee was well educated,  helpful,  friendly,  funny.   I enjoyed spending my money.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I changed my review that used to be good. We have been coming here for Christmas shopping and now I realize why I shop on Amazon. We came here to buy 2 pixel phones for our kids and the line was long and nobody to help. Now there were 3 employees in the Cell phone area but they could not help because it was not there department but it didn't stop them from congregating in a group of 3 talking about what they were going to do that night and how good some Marijuana was from some ace they got it. These employees are going to be the reason Best Buy folds like circuit city and everyone goes to Amazon. Bad customer service is something I can't handle when I'm spending good money.<//Review>

<Text>If it was possible to give 0 stars, I would. I made an appointment weeks in advance for the Geek Squad to install a dash camera. I received a confirmation email and a reminder email 2 days before the appointment. When I arrived and checked in, an Associate was called over from another area. When he arrived and started asking me what I was there for, it was clear he didn't have any idea I was there for my appointment. When I explained I had an appointment "right now" for an install, he proceeded to tell me he would need to reschedule my appointment to another location because they didn't have an installer on duty. When questioned how that could be and that I wasn't notified of any cancellation, he tried to explain their installer only worked part-time and only one day a month, etc. I had no idea what excuses he was trying to make or explain, but the point was I had a confirmed appointment, and if that had changed on the part of Best Buy and Geek Squad, there was no notification. This is completely unprofessional and I can't understand how you could conduct business like that and not have a system in place to update and notify customers of changes. Best Buy and Geek Squad has lost my business. There are PLENTY of other options to buy electronics and get reliable service. Bye-bye!< /Text>< response>

Worst customer service, had to wait 20 minutes + to speak to an available manager. Had to switch back and forth from stores to get a refund, can’t find help on the Geek Squad chat, phone not even the manager. Their technician did not install my radio as he was supposed to, radio kept on turning off until I hooked it to another technician and did an awesome job. Would like to know what they say when I came back to store for support? They denied it to me. They told me I had to pay more to get it reinstalled and rewrite. Thank you Best Buy team. Making this the most awful experience.</Text>

Because I was given a solution to a problem by a Samsung expert named Luis A. He solved something which no one else did. It truly changed my life. I'm so grateful that Best Buy hires good people like Luis.</Text>

Really fast service! Quick in and out! I bought a $200 monitor. No if's and's, or but's. Lots of staff around, every customer had at least one member staff with them assisting with their shopping. Greeter and Security were really helpful and so was the Point of Sale area. Great experience and would definitely recommend!< /review>

Yet again lives up to the Worst Buy title. Pro tip: when you advertise an item as in stock, then allow your customer to purchase said item and let them know it's ready for pick-up, it's generally a good idea to have the item actually in stock at the store.< /Text>

They have some issues with the total tech support membership that need to be fixed such as the limitation in the Chat and the wait in the phone... being able to talk with a real agent avoid the stress while waiting to go to the right department.

Overall, the geek squat tried to help me to deal with the issues I was having</text>

We really like having the ability to order something online and then pick-up at the store with no delivery charge. This has really worked nicely for us.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<review>Very helpful people! Don't forget to get a price match on items. If you can show any shop offering a lower price for the same product - Best buy will match the price! This is the best feature of Best buy that helps you get a product for cheapest price instantly.< /review>< date>

<text>It's ok if you need something right now. They had the latest Google Pixel on display though there was no stock of the model I was looking for. There are basic accessories for a variety of popular mobile phones though nothing outstanding. This is also true for computer accessories. Also the available models of headphones is underwhelming. Bottom line: nothing beats Amazon if it comes to electronics. This is particularly true with respect to the price tag.</text>< Pics>

<Text>If there was a zero star I would mark it! I took my trailer and truck in three different times because eswauldo, the technician did not know what he was doing.  I asked for a stereo and three cameras installed. The stereo does not connect to my phone as it should. I paid $70 extra to have the controls on my steering wheel work. They still do not work. He has no idea what he’s doing.  Everything I bought at the store he had to look at the box to find out what it does and how to install it. He has no knowledge of the products at Best Buy. He is the only technician there, which is sad because he has no idea how to install simple things like a stereo and back up cameras.  You get what you pay for! I paid $200. I would take back the 200 and all the products I bought from Best Buy if it wouldn’t take a day out of my schedule. I lost three days of work because of him, and my system still does not work properly.   I hope someone reads this review and does not go to the San Carlos Best Buy for any installation whatsoever! He is way too over worked. He has appointments all day. He cannot handle all of the appointments he has in one day obviously. I showed up and there were three cars already there at my scheduled time.  10 years ago Best Buy used to have a great insulation service. That time is gone. I hope no one has to go through the experience I had to go through!</Text></record></dataset><record>

My husband and I bought a 55" Smart TV here two weeks ago. We looked around and had some questions. Jack was very knoweledgable on the products. We really appreciate Jack for being attentive and helpful with our purchase. We are so happy with our purchase and the customer service we received. We plan on returning for a sound bar and other electronic devices.</review>

<text>Best Buy is a pretty straight forward franchise; anyone going to one knows exactly why they're there. So what ultimately separates one store from another is the quality of their staff. In that case, this Best Buy has always been a positive experience for me.<//text>< Time>

I ordered Bluetooth earbuds online then went it pick them up and hour later. Not sure why, but it took the staff 10-15 minutes to locate the ear buds in the store. I was half expecting someone to tell me they couldn't find them and send me to another store. I appreciate that they kept looking until they found them.< /text>

Haven't been to a Best Buy in a bit. This wasn't a bad store. It was as expected. Had a good amount of items that I was looking for and was able to make an informed decision. Normally shopping online is the way to go but when I need something today, well, Best Buy is there.< /text>

<review>Always friendly and knowledgeable. In the past I've always gone there first for my new cell phones. However this year they didn't offer any special deals with purchase, like oculus and a $400 gift card in 20015/16, so I had to go to Verizon to purchase my S9.< /review><user_name>Jan Chimera</user_name>< GmapID>

where to buy my Dyson air purifier there I'm a regular frequent buyer Best Buy. I don't know what just always been my experience that someone always comes up and asked me if I need help. I like the fact that they still greet people at the entrance to the store NEC to assist you as needed they may not be experts but they're very helpful. Most of them have a policy of not saying that they don't know. But they usually can find someone who does. Good for you Best Buy< /Text>

Also, when we asked about a specific movie the rep was not only able to tell us the section, but point to the exact spot where it was stored. Good training going on there.</text><rating>5< /rating><GmapID>0x808fa2159f5f4cd1:0x398b3a1d4d9638f2< /GmapID><userid>105360278885431556949<//userid>< Time>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>This Best buy location isn't better or worse than any other. The prices are ok. The customer service is sometimes great, but other times terrible. It just depends on who you get. I only go here if I can't wait for something to ship from online. I recommend knowing exactly what you want, what the price should be, and verifying their return policy before buying. Some things have restocking fees.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808fa2159f5f4cd1:0x398b3a1d4d9638f2</GmapID></record>

The location has definitely improved over the last 3 years. Their space has opened up. It looks more like an Apple store than a Best Buy from 3-4 years back. The staff is friendly and often allow you to browse through items peacefully. They also have sufficient knowledge to help out when needed.< /review>

Is Big Box brick & mortar feeling threatened by the likes of Amazon?  Well, they helped create the current state of affairs by muscling in on the original brick & mortars, then squeezing the life-blood out of them (think Home Depot and the demise of True Value, ACE Hardware). If there's anything to be learned here, going forward let's celebrate the success of Amazon. They got it, and continue getting it, right. So much so that the firsts to the e-commerce market that they followed are even in a state of panic scrambling, desperate to catch up. And we the people wait in awe of the next announcement of the next proposed Amazon brick & mortar store planned for opening. Because without a doubt they'll get it right. And we won't have to resort to the likes of Best Buy, who to this day don't have a clue when it comes the importance customer service and the traditional brick & mortars they worked so hard to eliminate< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Large space, very good for browsing. But like most brick and mortar these days finding exactly what you want is a little bit of a challenge. They have a great variety of products but very little depth. They just can't stock many models. Service seems to be much better these days.</review>

Not a true electronics store anymore. It's an electronic toy store. Did not meet the needs of a person needing electronic goods to fix or repair said electronic toys or goods. Staff was rude and not at all helpful. Was raining and they were out of cats. I asked if someone could get some of the carts from the parking lot, the Geek Squard girl said, and I quote, "but it's raining." Really? You don't say. Then after I asked again she said that she's send someone out to get carts "when it stopped raining." Then I discovered they no longer carried real electronic items, so I left and drove up to an amazing electronics store that not only had the cords I needed but we're helpful and kind. Skip Best Buy, as it truly isn't a Best buy, and go up the road a bit to San Mateo Electronics. Much better shop.</text>

I'm went into BB this morning looking for a washer/dryer set in red.  The Salesman found that GE make red, but according to him, only the washing machine came in red, no matching dryer ... ?????  So I came home and checked on line myself .... of course they make a matching dryer, so will order online.<//Review>

Very anxious to help and many associates available. They had a good variation of electronics of the latest technology. Security cameras, voice activated assistants, Smart TVs, and more. Some of the displays in appliances we're damaged, not sure if they are easy to damage or they are not handling them correctly.< /review>

<review>This place has improved a lot over the past few years.  Used to be nothing interesting here but I'll give them credit for revamping a lot of their displays.  Their PC section could still use more revamp compared to the selection at the Microsoft store, but I think their gadgets and TV selection has gotten quite good.< /review>< Pictures>

The store itself is fine, but if you have an issue, you should expect at least a week delay for Geek Squad to show up and it's a real hassle to get the appointment correctly set up.

Buy Amazon, save yourself the trouble.

The faster Circuit City, er... Best Buy ends, the better.<//Text>

<Text>This place never let's me down. I always come here for my gadgets. I love the smell of electronics when you walk through the doors. ( not sure if I'm the only one) they have car stereo equipment but if you plan on having them install it don't expect to have it done that day you may have to wait.< /Text><UserId.>106504995607711834838< /UserId.>< Pics>

If you are looking for responsiveness - look elsewhere.  3 friends applied for jobs at this BestBuy - all three were told they'd get a call for a follow-up interview ... NOTHING. SILENCE.  "Ghosting" people seems to be the norm with management here.  It's also VERY unprofessional</text>

<text>Spefically Geek squad, I like the quick service. They help me understand the the issue that I was having with my computer. However I feel like the repairs were not up to my standards as I recieved my laptop within the same week but the problems are still persisting. 3rd times the charm though so will update after I see how it goes.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>let's be honest, best buy is basically a front end for things i can get cheaper on amazon. and lets also be honest, it's easy to go to frys and enjoy the retail experience whereas it's hard to do that at best buy. so what's good at this best buy? it's near the airport and so it carry's a wide selection of headphones, phone cases, and tablet accessories. as there are several ipads and the offbrand tablet cases online are often marked to fit some models incorrectly i find its easier to go physically to best buy where i'm getting the same selection of branded cases (spline, otterbix, apple, etc) as id trust online but not having to deal with returns to international retailers which is slow and often hard to explain to get money back. i'd say what i dislike here is that if you really just want to look at first at what is available say of monitors or even phone cases like 5 bored sales people try to "help." ugh. i know service is supposed to make a place better but sometimes it's wiser for me to go see the options and then think in it overnight before buying. so in short this location has  good selection relative to its location and for item where you aren't exploring options but just going to get a specific option that you want to see in person it's fine but for a big open purchase, go to frys for ground research<//Review><Time>1563720911940<//Time><gmapID>0x808fa2159f5f4cd1:0x398b3a1d4d9638f2</gmapID>< Resp>

As usual, they didn't have what I needed.  Went to Amazon, who did.  I want to support the Big Box Brick and Mortar stores.  It isn't Amazon that's killing them.  It's their lack of inventory and exceedingly high prices.<//Text>

<Name>Grand Admiral Thrawn< /Name>< Review>
let's be honest, best buy is basically a front end for things i can get cheaper on amazon. and lets also be honest, it's easy to go to frys and enjoy the retail experience whereas it's hard to do that at best buy. so what's good at this best buy? it's near the airport and so it carry's a wide selection of headphones, phone cases, and tablet accessories. as there are several ipads and the offbrand tablet cases online are often marked to fit some models incorrectly i find its easier to go physically to best buy where i'm getting the same selection of branded cases (spline, otterbix, apple, etc) as id trust online but not having to deal with returns to international retailers which is slow and often hard to explain to get money back. i'd say what i dislike here is that if you really just want to look at first at what is available say of monitors or even phone cases like 5 bored sales people try to "help." ugh. i know service is supposed to make a place better but sometimes it's wiser for me to go see the options and then think in it overnight before buying. so in short this location has  good selection relative to its location and for item where you aren't exploring options but just going to get a specific option that you want to see in person it's fine but for a big open purchase, go to frys for ground research< /Review>

< Review>
takes forever to get someone to help. I try to go in knowing exactly what I want so I have minimal interaction with these employees. takes 5 people to call over a radio to get someone to unlock a cage. also went to exchange my broken product, but when I got to the counter, the lady at the register just asked for my receipt and processed a return instead of asking me what I wanted to do. I then had to wait longer for her to call a manager to override and cancel the return so I could simply exchange for a working product. only 4 stars because I love my toys, and almost always get them from best buy so I can buy a protection plan with them<//Review>

Likes the customer service. Bought a lenovo for my wife. They even sold me office 365  by their customer service else I would've not took from then.
The laptop was not charging above 58% battery so we got it replaced and immediately office was also setup quickly.

Collection of phones is good and there were guys with knowledge of electronics in the department. Very friend guys .< /Text>

No real electronics. If you need help, don't ask. No customer service, employees are rude and patronizing. Go up the road a ways to San Mateo Electronics Supply. Way better service and you'll get what you need without the drama.< /Text>

Super friendly, one of the Magnolia system designers took a few minutes to show me some music on some of the high-end speakers even though they were obviously outside my price range. That's the kind of stuff that will make me come back when I do have the money.< /Text>

<Text>Got a 10% off coupon, tried to buy tv audio receiver with it.  Since receiver was 500$ it was gonna save me some cash.  Sales rep came up with some bullshit why I couldn't use the coupon.  Tried to use this coupon online with the same receiver, and it worked.  So I finally went to Best Buy in mountain view, and was able to purchase it without problem.<//Text>< Pictures>

I purchased a new laptop in December 16, which ended up not being right for me for a variety of reasons. Best Buy's gracious return policy allowed me to return it for a complete refund with just a few simple and straightforward questions to answer. That's how I like to be treated. I'm very glad this brick and mortar store is still with us. I'll continue to do business with them going forward.< /text>

Do not shop at Best Buy.  They will not honor warranties.
They make you jump through so many hoops.

Do not purchase Insignia TV, they have a sound issue.
They rely on Best Buy to make the consumer jump through hoops.

I've spent about 2 months trying to get a product that works.  2 months!!!

<pics>None</pics><Review>There are Best Buy's and there are BEST BUY'S! This is definitely the latter one with all caps. The selection of popular and hard to get items is always on point and in stock, most of the time. The customer service is also better them all the other ones in the 50 miles radius. They know I'm a loyal customer at this particular location so they really cater to reasonable requests, especially the manager (female, but forgot her name). She has made my day on more then one occasion. Keep Rockin and Rollin!</Review>< gmapID>

The entire point of going there is to not wait for shipping. They did not carry what I wanted in stock and said they could order. I ended up ordering it from Amazon at the same price, got it the same time and got the color I wanted.</Review>

Even though I do most shopping online, I will continue to shop here as long as BB continues its price matching program.  On this trip, BB price-matched a lower price on its own website versus the price found in-store.< /review>

We picked out the tv we wanted, but when we went to check out, they didn't have any in stock or in their warehouse. If they don't have the tv, they should not display it for sale knowing they couldn't deliver. Very disappointed in Best Buy.< /review>

Pretty standard for a Best Buy. I came here to get a new phone and I was expecting to have one of the many employees who were by the phone section to be able to help but they all seemed to have better things to do even though there were no other customers.< /Text>

Maybe not as big and impressive as some other Best Buys I've been to but a Best Buy is a Best Buy. Have come here multiple times, did an Oculus Rift demo here, bought a keyboard, and perused the goods as I'm wont to do.</text>

<Review>Not usually crowded, and most of the employees are genuinely helpful especially when my "not-so-tech-saavy" mother shops here and needs a question answered in a truthful, non "salesman" fashion.

I purchased today Blu Vivo one. Then I purchased a airtel prepaid sim. All done within 30 mins, but when I discovered that the phone comes with screen guard, the problem start have to wait for 1 hrs to get it done. Worst ever I faced in any shopping center.< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>My mom went to this location to buy a TV. Her  English is not great! And the sales took advantage of her and sold her things were unnecessary. Two HDMI cables of $99 each!!!! My husband arrived later during the purchasing process. He stopped them to ask her to open a Best buy credit card and buy expensive tv and cables. But nothing had cancelled. Tv was delivered to the house along with all other things two days later. It took us another month to sort the mess out. No more Best buy!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

The best part of Best Buy is that they price match other major retailers and they're generally pretty easy to deal with.< /Text>

I was going to purchase a wiring harness for my car here. When I got to the counter, I showed the Amazon item to get price matched. The people there didn't even know what to do. They wanted to charge me what Amazon sells it for PLUS the shipping of the item. I've purchased and had things price matched before and this is the first I've encountered this. Not going back there again.</text>

They go to the back for like 20 minutes and forget to come out with the product. They asked me to take my dog outside in the most rude and demanding way which pissed me off not even making it past the entrance.
They made me wait several times, but today is the last time. I'm tired of waiting, and treated like a joke.
Too bad i can't give them a lower star.

Bad delivery experience. Store gave incorrect information on delivery and signature requirement. Impossible to get through to a person at the store. Voice prompt system is designed to keep a customer in limbo. Can't believe how bad they handled customer service.</review>

One of the few Best Buy's on the peninsula. Has a Samsung, Apple, AND Surface "pop up" shops inside, as well as a Magnolia home theater thing. Right off 101- plenty of free parking. Not a ton of open box items (not sure if that is a bad thing or not).<//Review>

Pretty run of the mill Best Buy. Advantages are that it seldom seems crowded, has plenty of parking, and has a large home-goods section. The main disadvantage I've come across is it seems to be sold out of things frequently.< /text>

I used to go to this store very often until I was cheated by it today.

I bought a AT&T refill card right before Christmas. When I bought it, I knew I would have a high chance of returning it due to some uncertainties. So, I asked the cashier about the return policy. He told me that it is refundable by Jan 15th.

But when I walked in there today and asked a refund, I was rejected by the customer service. Someone (like the manager) told me that it is not refundable this time, although everything in the card is intact. He even suggested me to go through a very complicated process to talk to AT&T for a refund.

OK. bestbuy. You lied to me (although unintentionly), but you want me to take the loss. You won. You took the money , and I will never come back again.<//Text>

I spent $140 on a pair of earbuds. For this price I expect not only the quality to be perfect, but the customer service as well. Forget the fact that the store employees had abolustely no emotion when I was buying them, at least I got all my questions taken care of. 4 days later I learned they were defecive and a piece snapped off. Apperantly according to the fantastic assisstant store manager, Man, a dog bit them and they don't cover against damage, just defect. Unless this 'dog' has the mouth of a hedgehog, I highly doubt it. There was no holes nor teeth marks present and only the size of my thumb nail was damaged. To add insult to injury one of the store employees decided to get someone that's not a store employee to back up their 'diagnosis'. Avoid this store at all costs.</Text>

At Best Buy, we strive to carry a wide variety of products to fit our customer’s needs, and we’re concerned to hear that was unachievable. I too would be disappointed if the location didn\'t offer the SD card I was looking forward to buying. If you should come across this situation again, we encourage you to view BestBuy.com or our Best Buy Mobile app and search "micro SD cards." You\'ll notice a larger selection of these available to order that may suit your needs. Also, please do not hesitate to ask our Blue Shirts to assist you with looking up certain SD cards online while you are in the store. Thanks for shopping at Best Buy.\n\nBest Regards,\nBri\nBest Buy Support'}</Response><Text>Went for micro sd cards.. Poor selection.</Text><Date>1553580011381<//Date></record></dataset><record>

There are literally hundreds of sales associates in the store. I tried calling the store to ask about a package I had shipped and was on hold for 25 minutes before hanging up. THATS RIDICULOUS. Wish I could zero star it.< /Review>
