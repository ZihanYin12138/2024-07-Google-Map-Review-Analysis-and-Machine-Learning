Friendly staff. Good food.  Great for grabbing a few drinks with a small group.  Wish they had more booze options though.< /Text>

The atmosphere was cozy. Staff were friendly and allowed us to split the check 5 ways (there were 11 if us). I had the taco trio with fries (pork belly, shrimp, and cauliflower) and the double classic Sloane's burger with salad. The food was good,  the soda is canned, not fountain. Everyone else in my party enjoyed their meals as well.< /Text>

We love Sloane’s! They have amazing food. The owner is a wonderful person. We have ordered a lot of different items on the menu and they are all delicious. A favorite is the curry fries - they are so yummy and filling. We loved the shrimp pasta. I also like the 3 tacos plate. Highly recommend going in when safe again, but in the meantime run over there and order pickup - you will not be disappointed.</text>

<review>Ok.. so in search of my bottomless mimosas, I found Sloane's. Let me say, #1..THE MUSIC IS ON POINT!! Whoever picked the playlist for today, Sunday 4/11, was ON ONE! Prince, Al Green, Smokey Robinson, Temptations, Stevie Wonder .. jammin from the moment I walked in..and the sound of poppin bottles was music to my ears!!
And #2, I had the 3 Belgium Waffles..and all I needed was a knife and fork. YES.. I NEVER TOUCHED THE SYRUP!! A waffle gotta be damn good to NOT NEED SYRRRRRUP!!
Bon appetit yall!!< /review>< Pictures>

We can bring our dog, the food is incredible, and the bottomless mimosas ... *chef’s kiss*. My favorite meal is the Bobby Brie burger. I’ve gotten it at least 10 times. But today I got the Brussels salad and it was amazing as well. Can’t go wrong at this place. Thank you for the amazing experiences.<//review>< pictures>

Celebrated my 30th birthday here! Not only was the food amazing, so was the staff. The atmosphere is lovely. Our waitress even put two dishes together when I couldn't decide between them and she took the cookies my best friend had brought and made this gorgeous birthday ice cream Sunday that we all shared and took our photo at the end of the night. She gave fantastic recommendations. Definitely recommend the brussel sprouts, the charcuterie and cheese boards, and the Ella Fitzgerald cocktail. Thank you for providing the perfect setting and experience that contributed to making my birthday amazing!<//Text>

Such a cute lil restaurant. I felt like I was on vacation by the beach and having lunch. Food was delicious, service was fast and friendly. Wish their truffled mushrooms had more truffle flavor, paid extra $2 for it but didn’t taste it in my burger, but the burger was still very good. Brussel sprouts were on point nice and crispy like it was described. Crispy onion rings were also good and portions were just right. Street parking only, but overall the dining experience was satisfying. I’ll definitely be back soon.< /review>

Great menu of sandwiches, salads, and breakfast offerings. Enclosed patio dinning room with smooth jazz piped in to create a nice dine in atmosphere. $6 beers and wines most days, with $12 bottomless mimosas and Perino beer on weekends. I had the regular burger and fries and the woman had the chicken sandwich for lunch. They were both top notch.< /Text>

Came here the first week after they opened their doors for dine in service during the covid pandemic. It's so cute. I had the garlic fries and a beer. Nothing special but it felt nice to dine out. Our server was so sweet. I'll definitely come back.</Text>

<Text>The food was amazing! I loved all the starters I tried. The Spanish octopus carpaccio, roasted bone marrow and wagyu beef tartare. I loved the scallops with the creme corn! The steak was cooked medium rare like I asked and it came out so perfect and mouthwatering. The sides were delicious as well, the Mexican street corn and mash potatoes. The tahitian vanilla crème brulee was very creamy and yummy. Chef Lynn is awesome! I will definitely come back.<//Text>< Pictures>

This is a nice neighborhood spot. I have seen many eateries in this space over the last 22 years so I hope this one makes it. I tried the fried cauliflower and fried pickles. Both were crispy and seasoned well. The beers were a little on the high side but the selections were good. I will definitely go back and try the mains and sandwiches.</text>

Walk inside, seat yourself and you’ll totally forget you’re on Laurel Canyon Blvd. It’s just so easy to feel comfortable with the cheerful and relaxing “vibe.” The food is delicious as well and I have no complaints about service either. Our waitress made good recommendations and was pleasant to talk to!<//review><Time>1565501357678</Time>< Response>

This place was amazing. Find me one brunch place this cute and this good with $9 bottomless mimosas WITH NO WAIT on Sunday morning! The food was really good, I got the burger with fried onions and pork belly (sorry can't remember the name). My food was great and everyone else's food at my table all looked really good too.<//review>

Swell and dandy is this welcome addition to the  village. Mid winter, mid week dinner was pretty good. Not crowded but comfortable for a chill meal with friends. The food is good and it’s great it’s in the village. The toasted cheese and soup was pretty good and the burger isn’t bad. Would try here for lunch or brunch.<//Review>

update: service... keeps going down. always put me on hold over the phone for 5-10mins. nobody is on top of it. frustrating since their chefs are top notch.

Had a fantastic brunch today for my birthday weekend. The food was pretty good but some of the dishes could use some work. I definitely recommend the Brie truffle board appetizer (I don’t know the actual name of it). And ask for Darcy. She was our server and she was incredible today. Had great recommendations and made a lot of accommodations for us. Definitely visiting again. Can’t beat 9$ bottomless mimosas and rosé!</text>

All day happy hour which means drinks 1.50 or 2 dollars off. The fried chicken sandwhich is my favorite dish on the menu. It's 12 dollars for the sandwhich alone but it's really big and very tasty. Great local place and a real gem in the area.<//text>

This is my favorite restaurant. Something that NoHo has been missing for a while. They have Excellent healthy (vegan, gluten free) options. The menu is creative and everything is SO  good.
Chill atmosphere, good vibes, great playlist.

😍😍😍 Its been so long since I've been to a restaurant that's taken my breath away. This place has fantastic food and a wonderful bright, open, and homely environment. I ordered a glass of Malbec, curry fries, and a Fried Cauliflower Burger (the villager) with sautéed truffle mushrooms. The cauliflower was so flavorful and the mushrooms had such a deep truffle flavor and the fries! They actually made me tear up with how delicious they were! This is definitely a fusion restaurant offering tacos and pasta and burgers, all with a twist to their generic/ usual composition. Again, so long since I've been somewhere in LA that's truly blown me away. As soon as you walk in you'll be wondering if you're still in Valley Village ✨< /review>

< review>
A brand new restaurant just opened in Valley Village. What a welcome addition to an area of Laurel Canyon that very little to offer.

They. have a very interesting menu that is split in two. One side offers items that go well paired with beer, and the other side of the menu goes well with wine. Of course this is only a suggestion. I chose items from both sides to go with my chardonnay, and it worked very well.

The food is delicious! I've been to the restaurant a few times. So far I've tried the grilled salmon over kale and  quinoa. Mixed in with it were pickled onions, red grapes and toasted hazelnuts. Light. but very flavorful. They also have a refreshing, and creamy gazpacho soup. which is perfect for this hot weather. I also tried the toast with truffles and brie. This was more of a hardy dish that consisted of toasted brown bread, sauteed mushrooms and gooey melted brie. Very yummy.

The menu has a lot to choose from, including salads. chicken, hamburgers, steak and pasta. The portions were large. and the prices were reasonable.

I can't wait to go back again!</review>

I would give this place 0 stars if I could! This place Is very unorganized and has terrible customer service and bad food.

I went here on a Saturday night around 8pm with my girls to celebrate my friend’s birthday and the waitress (Chelsea) was slow on taking our order, slow to bringing us our drinks, and had a very nasty attitude toward us. There were only two other customers and they already had their food, so there was no need for her to be slow on helping us.

They have a kitchen with an opening, but no door. And need I tell you the restaurant is outside so insects and rodents can easily enter the kitchen. There was no management from what we could tell because with every issue we had we could only speak to Chelsea about it.

There were 3 chefs from what we could tell and as they exited the kitchen to use the bathroom or take out the trash, they didn’t bother to greet us or make sure that we were taken care of during Chelsea’s absence.

My friend was given her alcoholic drink 20 minutes after ordering it and it tasted non-alcoholic. So my friend attempted to call Chelsea over, but she was no where in site. So my friend went into the kitchen to get her, and found her on the phone. Chelsea said she would come over soon.

We waited and Chelsea then told my friend that there is alcohol in it, but she replaced the liquor that was supposed to be in the drink with beer instead because they didn’t have the liquor the drink required. (Red Flag!!) My friend could’ve had a wheat allergy!!! So Chelsea said that she could bring the rest of the alcohol left in the can if she wanted it. My friend said yes and Chelsea brought her back an open and almost empty can. (Another Red Flag!!!) Health code violation! She apparently failed that test. And don’t worry our friend didn’t drink it.

After about an hour we got our entrees finally. We were given appetizers, but they weren’t very tasty or appealing (the appetizers came out before my friend’s drink did smh).

My friend went into the kitchen, after we had all received our disgusting looking dry food, to look for Chelsea again and to ask her to come to our table so that we could all address the issues we were having. Chelsea was on the damn phone talking! She gave my friend a nasty look and lifted her pointer finger as if to say “in 1 second.”

My friend sat back down at our table. Five minutes go by and none of us touch our food (accept our friend’s baby girl), now I’m upset. I go into the kitchen to confront Chelsea kindly, but adamantly and Chelsea is still on the phone, only she’s crying now. My goodness! I ask her to come to our table.

She then comes back to our table teary eyed and we tell her we are dissatisfied with the service and the food preparation and presentation. My friend states that she will of course pay for her daughter’s food and we would pay for our appetizers. By this point the birthday girl and our other friend leave because they are very disappointed.

We get the bill after waiting a while and Chelsea charged us for something we never even received. So we call her over again from the kitchen and tell her to change the bill. She then says “ok I’ll get that for you” and then starts cleaning our table with an attitude. She then reaches over my friend to take her daughter’s half eaten burger from in front of her. She then moves it to the table that now has all of our trash and dishes. My friend says “Did you just take my daughter’s burger from in front of her while she was clearly still eating it?” And Chelsea replied with an attitude “Sorry, I just keep doing everything wrong.” She grabs the burger with her hands and places in front of my friend’s daughter. (Disrespectful!! And another health code violation!)

My sister, my friend and I then say “oh no!! Goodbye! that was very disrespectful!” And Chelsea says “y’all are just tryna start drama!”

Who would want to go to a brand new restaurant with a baby girl and friends to celebrate their friend’s birthday just to start drama?!

Never will I ever....Never will we ever eat at this restaurant again!</text>

<review>My first waitress was nice. I had two for some reason. Both orders came out wrong. My hamburger was burnt, like crispy burnt. I did not get asked how I would like it cooked. The second burger was very well done also, when I asked for medium rare, but I ate it anyways. It was drenched in grease too. The french fries were good and the chicken was delicious. My friends order came without cheese, and without the sauces she requested. The take out containers kids didn't fit at all. They said oh well, that's all we have. I won't ever be going back.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

5 stars for the price and service! Comfy bed and they offer toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, etc in case you left yours at home! Very quiet considering right next to the freeway</review>

<Review>The management here is the kindest people I have ever met.  They went so far above and beyond, there is no way to adequately express my gratitude and appreciation.  They truly saved my family and I in a time of need (we were stranded with tire issues at night)    If you are looking for a nice place to stay, where your business is greatly appreciated... stay here! These folks are absolutely wonderful.<//Review>< rate>

< Review>
A very pleasant and charming stay in Big Pine.  The rooms are old school but well-kept and clean. The owners are super accommodating and kind, always asking if they can get you anything without being intrusive. There’s a nice outdoor area for eating or enjoying a beer at the end of the day. Overall I definitely would recommend!< /Review>

Tushar and Carol are wonderful hosts and take care to make each guest feel extra special. So many snack and drinks offered! The rooms were very clean and had fridge and coffee maker. Comfy beds. They gave us some great tips on nearby places to visit and hikes to take with our kids. Truly kind people, a wonderful place to stay!<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Wow! Just wow. The nicest people in the world own this place. The husband/wife team are there each day, working the desk, cleaning the rooms & getting to know their visitors. He even waited for us to get in our first night late, around 11pm. We were offered juice, milk, chap stick, maps, you name it!
It’s an older property. Probably built in 50s or 60s. It hasn’t had much work done to it but they have done the absolute very best job they could with the place. It felt extremely clean and no detail left out. Very good toiletries too! They give out the best lotion! I am obsessed!! It is so much better than your typical cheap hotel stuff. We had wifi, coffee, microwave and plenty of towels. They also have little snacks and juice out on the shared patio, so cute!
I can’t say enough good things. Highly recommend!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

We were on a road trip and hadn’t planned an intermediate stop. So we resorted to looking around at Big Pine. Because it was last minute, most places were full. But at Starlight we were greeted by the amicable Tushar and Carol who managed the motel together. Even though it was inconvenient for them they provided us a room for the night. The service and the amenities provided were much better than any other motel we’ve been to and in fact better than in some hotels. There was a unique personal touch to the services too.
If we drive up north again from LA we would love to stay here again. Would highly recommend.< /text>

<review>Tushar was very welcoming, and it was a quiet and clean place to stay in the Eastern Sierra's. The price was a bit high for a motel, but I didn't realize what sort of view I had until waking up. I was also the only person staying there for the night. I'd definitely stay again!< /review>< Pics>

When we first stayed at Starlight when came as quest and left as friends.
We just had to stay there again in the future.
This time we came as friends and left as best friends.
They have a great fish cleaning station,
And use of a freezer

<Text>Stopped here for one night stay on our drive from Lake Tahoe down to Palm Springs and it was a delightful experience.  I actually selected this motel over any other because of all the positive reviews and they were point on.  Owners were the most hospitable hosts we've ever encountered, down to their little touches like offering free chapstick and candy / granola bars left outside the rooms.  And while the building wasn't modern, the room was extremely clean.  Definitely recommend this choice if you need a place to stay in Big Pine.</Text>< user_name>

Great hotel. Super amazing manager who went over the top to make us comfortable and make sure we had the right direction to or next destination. Even gave us water for for or hike in the morning because the stores were all closed.< /Review>

real hospitable owner. Super nice guy; he helped us find an unofficial mechanic (hi, Pierre!) when all places were closed. Will be coming back here next time we're in Big Pine!<//Review>

Cutest friendliest and accominating motel we have stayed at. Patio for bbq's, with padded chairs to sit on, nice after driving a lot. A fire pit to enjoy in the evening. Moderately priced and worth the stop over. Would diffently stay agakn.< /Text>

<time>1527990325040</time><rate>5<//rate><text>This has to be one of the best little roadside motels we've ever stayed in.

Tushar, the owner, is wonderful. What a helpful man! He goes above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable at his motel.

He let us know the hours of all the nearby eateries. What attractions are nearby. And not only did he know what was happening in his little town of Big Pine, but he was knowledgeable in what was what in neighboring towns as well.

The rooms were quite and clean. The view of the nearby mountain range was spectacular.

If you're ever traveling down the 395 and need a place to spend the night you can't do better than the Starlight Motel.

Thanks Tushar!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>This motel and it's owner are gems! I have never experienced such a high level of hospitality and kindness. Upon checking in the owner was knowledgable about the local eateries and told us how much longer they would be open. He went great lengths to make sure we were taken care of. There were generous complimentary snacks when we arrived and juice with granola bars in the morning.

The room was very cozy, but incredibly clean and had plenty of storage options to keep your luggage out of the way. The heating / ac unit works really well and kept us cozy despite the cold temperatures outside. We never ran out of hot water, and the water pressure was amazing. The beds were surprisingly comfortable. It won't be the most comfy sleep of your life, but it's better than most places.

The owner seems to have thought of everything inconvenient about staying in a motel and worked hard to remedy them.

There is also an adorable bbq and fire pit area and a fish cleanin sink.

In my opinion, this place is an incomparable value. Stay here. You won't regret it.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Very friendly and helpful owner. Hotel is clean with cable TV, but the wifi is spotty and the outlets (came with sockets and USB ports) didn't actually charge my devices. Room has a large closet but the tiniest bathroom with only a shower stall. Owner offers juice, fruit, and cookies. No breakfast. For a country hotel it's very nice, but a bit pricey.</text></record></dataset><record>

Not your average roadside motel. Mr. Oza, the owner, clearly takes great pride in his establishment. The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable. Even though the entrance fronts US-395, the rooms are set back from the road. The thick cinderblock wall construction not only cuts down almost all the road noise, it keeps the rooms cooler in the summer and warmer in winter.

There are great mountain views off the back end of the hotel and a nice shaded deck and lawn area koi opposite the rooms. It is a very relaxing place to stay.

If you're used to the corporate hotel experience this might not be your cup of tea. Then again you might find it refreshingly different, including Mr. Oza's personal touch. He doesn't just run your card and toss you a key. He obviously cares about making your stay a good one.

Perfect for sportsmen who want to get out early and come back late. For other folks in transit, it's a good midway point between Reno and the L.A. Basin.

Yes I'm a fan. Stayed here over a dozen times. Never had a problem that was not immediately addressed and resolved.</Text>

Owners are so friendly and offer great rates. They helped me secure a room last minute when Priceline double-booked our hotel in Bishop. The property is old but they have newer wood laminate and tiled floors, flat-screen tv, comfortable beds, and a nice variety of soaps, lotions, coffee & tea. They also had juices and breakfast snacks available in the morning. We hope to stay here again.< /text>

Tushar, the owner, was super friendly and helpful. We were given room 14 and it was very clean and well-kept. My husband woke up around 5 am to a little bug on his pillow, at which point he turned on the light and proceeded to find 4 more just like it on the clean white sheets. They turned out to be bed bugs in their second larvae stage. We confirmed with our friend back home that owns a pest control service and he advised us what to do to prevent them spreading to our luggage and home. We showed Tushar and he told us about some group before us bringing their own bedding and how he had the place sprayed right after they left. That's great, but you need to have it sprayed every 5-7 days. He refunded us 50% of our one night stay, which in hindsight we should have probably received a full refund given that we have had to spend money to prevent the bed bugs from spreading and infesting our home. I give this place 5 stars for the friendly and accommodating management, and for the fact that the place is clearly well taken care of (clean bathrooms, crisp white sheets, etc.) - other than it needing to replace its mattresses and really hunker down on eliminating the bed bug problem.<//review>< pics>

One of the worst Motel's i have ever stayed in the rooms smell like urin,  the owners are unfriendly every time you leave your room they come in and shut the air off so you come back to a hot muggy room. the do not disturb sign means nothing my buddy left the room in the morning to grab some breakfast and i stayed in bed no more then 5 min later the door was opened and guess who it was , the owner wanting to shut the air off.  I do not recommend this hotel<//Text>

Never stay at this place. My husband and I called to book a reservation and told the man on the phone I had my service dog with me and he refused to let us stay based on their no pet policy, which is a clear violation of the American Disabilities Act of 1990. We politely told him that it's illegal to deny us service based on my disability, and he continued to argue with us and was extremely rude. He demanded we stay elsewhere, and outright refused service to us. I'm really appalled at the way we were treated by the staff, and am saddened to think they treat others that way. I would never recommend this place to anyone, they clearly have no regard for the law and discriminate against the disabled.< /Review>

<Review>Big Pine, Big Surprise.
Lucky for me I ignore most reviews older than a month. This place has new India Indian American owner. It is a new trend I have been discovering on my so far 5,600 mile H-D motorcycle SE USA tour. These American citizen immigrants are a boast to out Immigration Policies (ok, not all pocies are great). But these (I've met and stayed at 3 so far) owner operators know customer service and have a great work ethic. So kind and knowledgeable of the area. 3 of the places have all been restored 1950/60 motels. I say restored, but some are built very well so original equipment still works well and has been maintained. I started testing some of these old motels and have been greatly surprised that75% plus are great values for the money. And Tushar, the new owner, is a first class gentleman and host.< /Review>< Rating>

< review>
(Translated by Google) The place where we found ourselves by the will of fate, or rather the bad weather, trying to drive from Las Vegas to Sacramento in January. Great motel with premium quality cosmetics, juices and cookies for kids. I have remembered their motto for the rest of my life. Come as client, live as a friend!

<Text>(Translated by Google) "Come as guests - leave as friends!" The Indian-born owner makes the stay special with his friendly and extremely helpful nature. We arrived late and our daughters were first treated to soft drinks and sweets. A welcome drink seems to belong here. The rooms are totally clean, have a nice wooden floor and the Wi-Fi works. In the courtyard there is a nice, shady "deck" under tall trees on which you can grill. For breakfast there are juices, fruit and granola bars. If you can not see the chain hotels, you will feel very well here!

"Come as Guests - Leave as Friends!" Der indischstämmige Besitzer macht mit seiner freundlichen und extrem hilfsbereiten Art den Aufenthalt zu etwas Besonderem. Wir kamen spät an und unsere Töchter wurden erstmal mit Softdrinks und Süßigkeiten beglückt. Ein Willkommensgetränk scheint hier dazuzugehören. Die Zimmer sind total sauber, haben einen schönen Holzboden und das W-Lan funktioniert. Im Hof gibt es ein nettes, schattiges "Deck" unter hohen Bäumen auf dem man auch grillen kann. Zum Frühstück gibt es Säfte, Obst und Müsliriegel. Wer die Ketten-Hotels nicht mehr sehen kann, wird sich hier sehr wohl fühlen!<//Text>< Pictures>

Used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant, until today. Discovered the horchata I was drinking from had an entire insect in it. Instantly became sick and threw up, and couldn't finish the rest of my food. Who knows what else is hidden and crawling through everything else?! Never buying from Taquiza Limon again.< /review>

<text>I love the fact that only so many customers are allowed in at a time and they really take care to secure and cover each food order. The meat is seasoned to perfection and the portions are pretty generous. Great prices and customer care will have us returning over and over!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Very disappointed in this food. Ordered menudo with no pata. All I got was 1 big bone. In a container only 3/4 full with only 2 pieces of tripe that were not even close to cooked. Couldn't even chew. Had to throw it away. Also Ordered a shrimp taco. 3 shrimp on taco. Not worth it. I see decent reviews but my experience today won't take me back to try anything else. Total waste of money.<//text>

<time>1568585534320</time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Great family friendly restaurant. Not a huge place, it has 4 tables inside and patio tables outside. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table! A wide variety of choices for plates and burritos.

Parking: this place is located at a shopping center so there’s plenty of parking spots. There’s also an ATM in the area Incase you’re in need of cash :).

Food: the food tasted really good and fresh! I ordered carne asada plate and there’s was nothing left but the lettuce :). My friend ordered Chile Relleno and tamale. The kiddos got burritos and they loved it too.

Service: really family friendly, attentive, and very nice people. There were a lot of door dash orders (so you know, it’s good). Thank you!!! We will come again!</Review>< pictures>

Amazing food, my papa doesn't like onions on his food and normally restaurants don't follow the request for no onions or pico de gallo on items. Taquiza Limon followed all special requests and everyone LOVED the food. My papa was extremely satisfied and raved about how good the tacos were. Delicious food for a great value, I look forward to getting food from here again!< /Review>

Would have give  0 stars if there was an option. Worst burrito I have ever had. In my 28 years of living and I've eaten off of some sketchy looking gut trucks.  Ate here on 9/17/2020 and the beans in my burrito were crunch.</Text>

Absolutely love this place ♥️ The food tastes so fresh and delicious! I come to eat here regularly because it's so good! The service is great too! There's not many delicious food places in Oakley, but you can bet this is definetely one of the best! It's like a hole in the wall restaurant, and I recommend 100%!< /Review>

Great authentic food!  I always order a Carne Super Burrito.
Small restaurant, some outdoor seating too.
I recommend calling in your order, to save yourself a 20 min wait in store.<//Text>

Pretty poor to me. Meat was definitely not fresh or was crazy overcooked, the pork was in better shape than the chicken, and the pastor was much more bland than I'm used to. Staff was very nice and parking was easy but they were not very good tacos at all.</text>

Best Mexican food in the whole East Bay!!! A few reviews say it's "too spicy". (It is coming from people in Oakley, wink wink) but I COMPLETELY DISAGREE. every bite is bursting with flavor. I've ordered her 4 times and each time is better than the last. The Cali burrito is off the chain. Chase it down with some delicious horchata. I mean anything you order you can't go wrong. Love love love!<//text>

Great place! one of the best in the area.
Ordered the super alpastor wet burrito.. was reallly good and nice size plate. I come here regularly and never ordered anything I didn't like. The people are very respectful and the place is clean the only thing is sometimes it can get full in there fast and there is very limited seating due to the size of this place</Text>

Love this place. Great crispy/soft tacos, burritos, enchiladas, barbacoa, homemade tortillas on the weekend, rice & beans good together. But let me tell you about that ceviche! Delicious, fresh, and so refreshing. Prices are very decent here too! Always recommend.< /Review>

This is my favorite Mexican place!! If you haven't been here...GO! I have a minor addiction to the Cali Burrito with Carne Asada. The small town vibe here is great, you can tell it's a family business and it feels good supporting businesses like that... But even if it wasn't a small town vibe their food would keep me coming back again and again!<//review>

Great little place with friendly service. I've had the tamale, carne asada taco, and enchiladas with verde sauce. They were all delicious.</Review>

<review>Great flavors! Their carnitas is delicious. I also highly recommend the crispy potato tacos. Make sure to stop by on Tuesdays for discounted tacos which are also very good. Cream-filled, homemade churros are to die for. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. The place is small but has outdoor seating. Decor is clean and what you'd expect from a Mexican food restaurant. You can't go wrong with this family-owned place.</review>< user_id>

I've eaten at this restaurant since it opened. I was worried when the original couple running the place retired that the food would change. Not one bit! With a family of 6 you can't beat the price and the quality is always outstanding. We find it hard to eat at other Mexican restaurants as the quality of meat and fresh ingredients has not been matched anywhere else. I'm reluctant to write this review as I like how low key and private the setting is but they absolutely deserve everyone to try their food! There's food that's great and then there's food you can taste how much care went into it from ingredients to service. In short, this is my family's favorite food in town! Come enjoy! (Just don't take all the pineapple Jarritos, that's all I ask people!)<//review>

Was really looking forward to coming here and we we're disappointed with the service. Very understaffed and it took 20 minutes to even get a high chair from the back. My 3 kids got their food first and by the time my wife and I got ours the kids were already done eating. To make matters worse they got my order wrong and had to remake it. However i gave them a 4 though because they rebounded quicky with my mucho grande burrito and they gave us churro's on the house. Food was excellent though and lived up to expectations.  They just need someone assisting the lady at the register.  This place is way to busy for her to handle everyone.< /text>

That fact only AMPLIFIED the amazing and fresh (i mean FFFRReehhhhSH) taste of these giftS to the patron of Taquiza Limon! First time going and ... the sadness is real when it comes to the fact that I'm always on the road. This would be my OD spot. "Uuum yes its me again" would be my greeting lol.
The veggie burrito + fries - dairy = THE CHEAT CODE for a hecca bomb veggie option. If don't think that is enough add the heavenly crispy potato tacos + guac to your order and thank me later.
O_O I'll be back.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x8085566d9acb30cb:0x893c00a2d1b0b99d<//gmapID></record>

<review>(Translated by Google) The food is more or less. The dish I ordered was roast beef and the meat was cut as if it had been taken from a taco. I prefer that they be meat steaks. The chips like they were from stock market. The sauce without flavor. And it took half an hour to bring us the food. I saw the people who ordered to take them to arrive and they supplied themselves less than we had been waiting for 40 minutes. I just do not recommend this place very hard to find on the GPS. I give it 2 stars. It can be better . That does not leave us bad to the Mexican pope. That is all .

(Original)
La comida está más oh menos . El plato que pedí era de carne asada  y vino cortada la carne como que se la sacaron de un taco . A mi me gusta de preferencia que sean filetes de carne. Los chips como que eran de bolsa de mercado . La salsa sin sabor . Y pa cabar se tardaron media hora en traernos la comida. Veía a la gente que ordenó para llevar que llegaban y se surtían menos nosotros que llevábamos 40 minutos esperando .solo se que no lo recomiendo mucho este lugarsito difícil de encontrar en el gps. Le doy 2 estrellas . Puede mejorar . Que no nos deje mal a los mexicanos papa.

Pro: fast friendly staff, can upload documents online without printing out documents to turn in, free parking.
Con: Call center open most days but store only 2 days a week. Only 2 employees at the branch so was a small wait even with appointment. They organize all the data and fill out forms but you the customer still need to obtain the info for example if you're missing your W2 then you still need to call your employer to get the data.</review>

<review>It depends on who is doing my taxes, last year I had a horrible person who did not know anything it seemed and had to keep looking things up.  My confidence level was zero and we ended up having to pay $5,000. in taxes, which i still think is incorrect.  The only reason I went back to H&R block this year is that my friends mom, Linda worked there. She did  fantastic job and knew her stuff.  As long as I can go to Linda, I will continue using H&R Block.<//review>< Pictures>

Marsha was great and very attentive! She was knowledgeable and made sure I understood everything she was entering into the system, which is greatly appreciated by someone who is completely lost when it comes to doing my taxes!</review>

I love my tax preparer Linda McGluckin.  I hope that I did not misspell her last name because I don't have her card directly in front of me.  Linda is great and she provides useful information for every question you can ask.  And if she doesn't know she will research to find out and get back to you.  EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>It was way to expensive. I lost out on $132 on my taxes. This was my first time ever going to H&R Block, and because of this experience I have been telling all my peers not to go here. We go to you guys for service with filing taxes but it seems like your service is more of a way to take from your clients taxes. What I do not really understand is why it was supposed to only cost me $118 for simple things I had nothing special to add onto my tax report expect for my income. Not to mention I had a $25 off coupon so it brought it down to $93 but then went up by $39.95 when I mentioned I wanted to just have your company take the $93 out of my taxes when they arrive. That is absolutely unacceptable. I am already paying your agents to file the taxes for me so what is the point of the extra fee. I do not feel like that a fair thing to do to your clientele. I look forward to my hard earned tax money every year for bills that I have been having a hard time with receiveing money for.<//Review>< Pics>

Anne henson is and always will be the perfect tax preparer you can ask for. Trusting and knows how to interact with her clients.  This is my 4th year and I appreciate the customer service and knowledge/advice she gives.</Review>

I went to this particular H&R Block last year, and the customer service was ok. However, the fee they charged me for doing my taxes was Ridiculous!!!! They charged me $440 to file my simple tax return. I had spoken with quite a few people about this $440 fee, and they all were asking why so much! A few people also told me that with THEY'RE experience at a random H&R Block, they charged them from $80-$150 to file they're taxes. I feel this place had ripped me off real bad!! And to add to it, the Department of Education took my refund (because I did owe), and H&R Block hounded me to pay them the $440 anyway! Wow!! I will not......go back to this place EVER!< /Review>< pics>

<rating>3</rating><Review>nice big clean machines. some could use some maintenance, but overall they seem pretty reliable. not a large facility. not a large number of machines. so plan well and prepare to wait for a spot, especially on weekends. staff is helpful... except for when they close the front door for the last hour and tell everyone already inside to move their cars around to the back entrance. there you will find very few parking spots and none are a convenient distance from the small back door. thus a lot of chaos and dropping things and baskets left along sidewalk at the end of the process. not a great "procedure."< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Overall, this is a very nice laundrymat!
It is clean, the employees are friendly,
and it is in a good location. However, I
am reluctant to go back because half of the customers,(including the employee), were not wearing masks. There is currently a mandate from the governor that all Californians must wear masks in public. There is a sign on the door that says all customers must wear masks, but it is definitely not being enforced.  This surprised me, especially because it is virtually impossible to social distance inside the laundromat.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Prices here is lower by .50 cents compared to where I usually do laundry at which made me happy it's a friendly place. It is a small place and moving around in there is very tight when there's a lot of people. All and all I liked it.</Review>

I've been coming to this laundromat for over 2 years now. It is well staffed and clean. The vending machines have anything you may have forgotten or ran out of like laundry soap and fabric softener. There are 2 machines offering $0.50 beverages and snacks. There are nice big machines to wash clothes and they actually get stuff CLEAN! The dryers are nice and hot. The best Laundromat EVER!!< /Text>

Come every week. Plenty of machines and you can get quarters for your cash. Washers are $2 to $3.50 and dryers 25 cents per 8 minute dry. I usually dry for 24 minutes on medium.< /review>

<text>In general, I dislike going to the laundromat because who really enjoys doing laundry? Nevertheless, every now and then, I need to use the commercial-sized washers ... so here I am.
My expectations, in terms of service, are nothing. After all, it’s a self-service laundromat.
I expect to sit and wait ... nothing more, nothing less.

The laundromat attendant noticed me standing and staring at my laundry spin. My wife was sitting in the single seat next to the machine. I assumed I would be standing for the next hour.

The attendant stopped what she was doing to bring me a chair. Not only that, she brought us water and offered to share some of HER grapes with us. Small gestures go a long way.
Thank You.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rate>

This place is clean, tidy,  and constantly kept up by personnel. Large capacity washers do better job than regular size washers. Can be VERY busy with little manerving room on the weekends; much lesser people during the week. Vending machines for soap, etc. Average cost of washing/drying (high..)</review>

<text>This place has come a long way since 2005. All equipment is nearly new. It would be nice if the hikers would park in the back lot or along the road to make it easier for the patrons who are trying to utilize the facilities though.< /text><rating>5< /rating><user>113375403940163158075< /user>< Resp>

This is a great laundromat. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. The machines are clean and the prices are fair. Snacks & drinks are only fifty cents- which is great if you have kids with you. I am having my washer and dryer delivered this week, but I will still be back in the future to do my comforters and larger loads.< /text>

< Review>
I have been coming here almost every week for 2 years. That being said- I wish it were a little cheaper for the washers, however, I can have quite a load of laundry in the medium washers and the wash is very clean at the end. Also, the location is clean and the owner is active with his business and very considerate. I use my visits as quite time- the early mornings or early evenings can be fairly quiet and calm< /Review>

<text>I had dropped a twenty dollar bill and the employee Sandy quickly picked it up and gave it back to me. She is so honest and nice. She even gives out free water in the summer.  It is always clean and the hours are great. Best laundromat in the valley.< /text>< Name>

As far as laundry mat places go this one is ok. I think its a little pricey to wash hete but drying is really reasonable. It was clean most of the machines were in working order. Tbere were lots of people there doing laundry so it was hard to move about. My clothes got clean and i never had to wait for a machine to open up. Also they are open until 11 pm.<//review>

I was Amazingly surprised and pleased upon my arrival for the first time at Thrifty Wash.  Our brand new washer broke down after only having it for 28 days and forced me into a terrible choice.  I had the option of wearing dirty clothes and smelling or going to a public laundromat.  I was not sure which option was the worst of the two.  My early days of public laundromats could cause anyone nightmares.  I pulled up with anxiety going through my body and was extremely upset that it had come to this option.  I walked in and was floored.  My eyes went right to the immaculately kept floors.  Nice large bright tile that one of the employees was mopping to keep the glow of a wonderful place I walked into.  I almost forgot I was in a public laundromat.  I walked further into the place and it was cleaner than my own laundry set up at home.  All of the washers and dryers where clean from dirt or grime.  Yes, I did decide to check out the place and to try to find some.  I just could not believe my experience.  I had a nice chat with the lady that was taking care of the place; her name is Sandy and she gave me the owner's name and number.  I wanted to give this person a call to let him know what an excellent job he and his staff have done to make this a truly wonderful experience.  When I gave the owner a call, he was pleasant and respectful, exactly what his business represents.  This is the first review I have done for any type of business that I have patronized and it gives me great pleasure to do so.  Oh, I almost forgot, if you want a snack of chips, candy, or soda while waiting, it won't break the bank.  They are only .50 cents each...Yes..that is right!!..yes, even for soda!!..Thank you Mr. Jim Gordon and Sandy for making my day!</text>

I went about a week ago, and I received an excellent, clean, and friendly service; the fluff and fold service was also really nice and it was done in a couple hours and in a really good price. This is the best laundry service and place I've been to. I really recommend it to all the Coachella Valley; and I'm definitely returning.< /text>

<review>I Came here to do a little laundry seeing the reviews were great. One star because you have to pay to use the restroom.  Absolutely insane, I have never ever seen such a thing.  Furthermore,  the employee was starring at me very rudely even after I warmly said hello.
As an update,  the 40 pound washer didn't spin out a lightweight backpacking sleeping bag  and I asked an employee to check it out and she rudely said even though it says 40 pounds it's not.  She literally watched me put my load in and said nothing prior to me starting it. She reluctantly restarted the load with more attitude than I have seen in a while.  I am Shocked by how terribly rude and nasty she was.</review>< pics>

It was the only place that was close and it was super clean and really affordable! Our resort didn't have self serve facilities and we like to save money for fun stuff not to have our laundry done by professionals.<//Review>

<review>We've used the Thrifty Wash Laundromat in the Rimrock Shopping Centre on E. Palm Canyon weekly in the last three winters that we've spent time in Palm Springs.  The equipment is well maintained in what is probably the cleanest, brightest laundromat I've ever been in. It is kept spotlessly clean by Eny who is, I believe, the manager (hope I'm remembering her name right). She is constantly mopping the floors, checking the dryers, wiping the washers inside and out.<//review>< gmapID>

This place rules. Wash a bit expensive for front loading machines but dryers are cheap and massive and soda/snacks are only 50 cents. Plus it's open late! I never go anywhere else.<//review>

<Text>Ernesto & his team did an immaculate job replacing the AC compressor with a new Trane unit. His team also upgraded the existing coil unit in the HVAC to match the new AC unit. They did a fantastic job of replacing/installing new vents throughout the house & creating a new one into the existing duct work in one of the rooms. Castillo employees communicated efficiently & effectively via phone & email correspondence
in delineating the proposal, verbally during installation process throughout the day & completion of work performed to customer satisfaction. Just awaiting for the final inspection to make it official with the county permit.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80db62c204c5a6e9:0xa37d7d7d354be352< /gmap_id><rate>5<//rate>< username>

The owner is very easy to speak with. The technicians are very professional . They finish the job when they said they would. The 2 day installation process was painless. With no air conditioner and a full house, we hardly notice them moving in and out of the house. I would recommend this company.<//review>

I called in to Castillo on a Monday and they came out next day to fix my A/C. Nate was my tech and he was very professional kept me up to date with what he was doing at all times. I got text messages informing me of when they were going to show up, when my service was and when it was completed. When I called in the service was outstanding. I got emails right away notifying of everything. I couldn't be happier.<//Text>

<Review>Have used Castillo several times over the years, always with exceptional results. This time AC was running but not cooling. Nate was able to come earlier that scheduled, did a thorough examination, presented the possible options and worked for several hours to try and rectify the problem.

We can't be happier.  Our air condition stopped working two days ago when the temperature was 107 degrees.  It's always nerve wracking when you're trying to find a reputable company and we have been stung before.  We were imagining all sorts of high-cost estimates and were PLEASANTLY surprised and pleased with our very reasonable bill.  Their repairman, Nate, was knowledgeable and answered all our questions.  Repairs were accomplished very quickly and competently.  We highly recommend this company.<//Review>

<Review>I discovered Castillo HVAC back in the day when I didn't schedule routine maintenance, the coolant escaped, and I couldn't figure out why the A/C wasn't A/C'ing.  They responded promptly and gave me the data about codes changing in the near future (in HVAC days) with the choice to keep the coolant type I had which would probably hold as long as I live or upgrade to meet new standards in case the unit needed additional coolant after 2020 when it would no longer be available.  I upgraded to 2020 standards although it was only 2017 or so and have scheduled routine maintenance ever since.  I added a 3-filter system and have appreciated the filtered air with the multiple fires in So Cal.  More than once I've noticed nothing in the air until I opened my garage door to go biking.  Castillo HVAC hires competent technicians who are socially perfect for interacting with customers - not an easy combination to find.  I'm so glad I called them when I was sweltering in my house wondering what happened!</Review>< user>

Art was on time everyday. His crew was professional and courteous. Art was never in a rush, and took the time to answer all the questions I had. In the end I got the mini split system I was looking for at a price better than any other estimate I received. Truly appreciate the service, professionalism and kindness delivered.<//review>

<Review>Castillo Air and Heating did a fantastic job! From Art coming out and giving us a great estimate and working with our schedule to Ernesto completing the job, the process was smooth and fast! Ernesto installed the system in one day so we did not have to go without a/c in 100 degree weather! We are so pleased with all the work done!<//Review></record>

<text>I was referred to Art Castillo by my neighbor to replace an old furnace and A/C unit with a new heat pump.  From the initial meeting with Art, to the service and responsiveness of the installers and the office staff,  the process went smoothly and professionally. My new unit works perfectly and saves me money in energy costs. I could not be happier with my choice of Castillo Heating & Air.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>The work is part of a service plan when Castillo Heating installed a new Heat Pump last October 2020.

The install went well, on time and clean. Assessment, options and pricing with Art were stress free. Installation crew -Ernesto, Tony and Nate were excellent, knows what they were doing and courteous.

Summer is coming so the maintenance/check up came at the right time. Nate was ahead of schedule, happy  and courteous
- Opened up attic access and inspected horizontal mount modular blower
- Changed out filter for customer (customer provided)
- Took diagnostics of the unit and stated System is operating as designed

My experience with Art, the office staff, and the install/maintenance personnel is excellent.< /Review><userid>113630320436091932594<//userid><gmapID>0x80db62c204c5a6e9:0xa37d7d7d354be352<//gmapID>< Name>

<Review>I'm an advocate of supporting local small businesses such as Castillo Heating & Air Conditioning, Inc., and not just to help them gain revenue and stay operational.  You’ll gain plenty of wonderful benefits as well;
excellent, personalized customer service along with an approved independent Trane Comfort Specialist™ dealer.  Thank you Art, Teresa, Ernesto and team.< /Review>< Pictures>

Fantastic company!  They went above and beyond to fix my mom's AC. She lives in Menniffe and I live in San Diego. She is very hard of hearing and can't use the phone. I contacted Castillo on her behalf. They were so accommodating and ended up fixing her air that evening. After business hours. I will recommend them to anyone and everyone! Thank you so much Castillo Heating and Air.</Text>

< review>
We live in the mountains above Palm Desert where the temperature in the summer can hit 100 degrees and yet fall to 20 in the winter.

We had lived in our home for 15 years without quite being able to justify installing A/C since our Swamp Cooler coped reasonably well apart from about a month a year and we were out of the house during the days.

And then Covid hit and we were working from home and our Swamp Cooler simply couldn't do enough to make the 100 degree temperature during the day livable.

So, we asked Castillo Heating & Air Conditioning for some suggestions and a quote.

They proposed a Ductless three-way split system which would save us money on Propane during the winter months as well as cooling the house during the summer.

It took them two days to install it but they were quiet enough that we could work throughout with a minimum of disruption.

The ductless mini-split was amazing and made the temperature in the house much cooler. Indeed, my teenage daughter's room is like a morgue because she likes it really cool and keeps the door closed (did I mention "teenage").

However, the unit in the Master Bedroom was not performing as well as we would have liked. It was still acceptable to me, but my wife wasn't satisfied (I am not criticising her; she was right - I'm simply less aware of my environment than she is and didn't notice that it was closer to 80 than to the 75 it was set to). We called Castillo two times to look at it.

The first time, there was a genuine issue. One of the two fuses in the outside unit had blown and so it was running on half power. This was better than not running at all, I suppose, but the fact that it was running meant that we didn't have any reason to check the fuses. They replaced the fuse and assured us that it was very rare for them to blow like that and it was probably just a bad fuse in the first place. In the 6 weeks since then, the fuses have been fine despite a few power outages due to our Utility.

My wife was still unhappy and called Castillo's again. The chap that came examined everything again and was helpful and polite. Finally, he noticed that the vent in the Master Bedroom for the Swamp Cooler was still open and was about 4 foot above the ductless unit in that room. By checking with his thermometer, he found that the ductless unit was effectively sucking the air from outside through that vent. This was made worse by the fact that the swamp cooler is sort of above the outside condenser and so that air was extra warm.

He closed and covered that vent (and covered the other vents as well which were doubtless leaking air despite being closed) and, sure enough, it made a HUGE difference - Instead of being 78 degrees in the Master Bedroom, it was 68 last night ! (We have now set it to 75 and it's doing great.)

Thank you Castillo's for your hard work, your patience and your kindness when you must have been thinking that we were complete pains.

Very Highly Recommended.</review>

Hugo called to let me know he could arrive earlier than the promised 2-hour arrival window.  He arrived when he said he would.  He was very professional and inspected my air conditioning unit, called the manufacture to determine if unit was under any warranty and explained in detail what this company would be proposing for replacing the unit.  Hugo wore all of his PPE that is required now during this pandemic.  I would definitely recommend Hugo and Castillo Heating and Air.<//Text>

Art Castillo, himself, came in on the weekend to look at and repair our AC.  Such a super guy, and I didn’t even realize he was the president of the company till now.  You can trust him and his team with your HVAC maintenance needs. Btw, Art took it on his own to go back to his shop and  find a part and come back to install to prevent our AC from being down all weekend.  Art’s a leader that inspires professionalism and leads his team by example.  Very, very impressed!  Thanks Team Castillo!</Text>

<Review>Second time I've used Castillo. First in Sun City with what turned out to be a while system replacement and then here in east Hemet. Turned out to be something simple this time and just charged the diagnostic fee. Professional and knowledgeable staff. Will be glad to use them for all my HVAC needs.</Review><GmapID>0x80db62c204c5a6e9:0xa37d7d7d354be352<//GmapID>< response>

<text>My issue was little to no hot air when the heater was on.   Hugo and Arturo were very methodical in performing a diagnostic of the heating system. Turned out a fouled sensor was the culprit. This was quickly rectified.  Professional and friendly.  Great value for their services.    Castillo HVASC is my go-to for heating and air conditioning issues.  I recommend everyone give them a try.  You will not be disappointed.</text>< time>

<Date>1580938553050</Date><Rating>5< /Rating><text>We highly recommend Castillo Heating & Air Conditioning. We had a system that was 10 years old, half of it stopped working. We solicited multiple estimates from 5 different companies before deciding on one. Naturally we had many questions on what would be the right system for our home Art even came out to our home a second time just to do a feasibility study to put our minds at ease the system we were getting was going to work for the entire house. Art, Amanda, and Teresa always answered every question we had regardless of what time or day it was. One the day of install Art, Ernesto, and Hugo showed up with crew in hand and they told us every step of the two day process. We could not be happier with the finished result, not to mention the efficiency of the system, and one of the best parts we are no longer using a ton of propane to heat our house because our new system has heat pumps. When you decide to go with any service from Castillo you are not just one of their customers, but you are family, and they make it point to listen and make sure all your heating and AC needs are met, not just try to sell you a system. From the start of estimates, to working with us with financing, the whole install process and beyond I cannot say enough good things about them. Castillo was definitely the right choice to make and I am glad we did.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>FOLLOW UP - After providing such excellent service on our furnace a few months back, we contacted Castillo to do a maintenance review and service on our AC.  Again, excellent service and very honest and professional.  I will continue to refer Castillo to anyone in my community looking for great a great HVAC company!
****************************
Placed a call around 6PM.  Heard back early the next morning.  They were able to send out a technician same day who was very professional.  He had to locate the part we needed for our very old furnace and had it repaired and up and running withing a couple of hours.  Will absolutely use again for our HVAC needs in the future.</review>< user_name>

Air conditioner went out right before the holiday weekend. Although they were booked, they squeezed me in the next morning!They were very prompt and knew exactly what was wrong and had the part on hand to fix it. Their price was more than fair and I really appreciate that!  It’s great to work with local business that are talented, honest and hardworking.

Tech was knowledgeable, on time and thorough. Problem ended up to be an oversight on my part but the inspection and troubleshooting was so complete I have peace of mind that the system is safe and secure.

Castillo Heating and Air Conditioning replaced my 43 year old furnace.  All persons involved were courteous, highly professional, and a pleasure to work with.  Price was competitive.  I am very pleased with my new furnace, and with every aspect of how the project was handled.</Review>

<Text>We were pleased that Castillo HVAC responed to our request to check the HVAC for the home we have in escrow. All HVAC businesses are booked solid due to covid-19 and the heat wave. Castillo was the only company to respond to my request. Many simply did not want to be bothered by a measly service call to check equipment for a potentiial buyer! The twp servicemen lookeed very young, but my concerns were alleviated when they  listened to my concerns about the system and they briefed me on how they would address the problems. They were neat, courteous and accomplished everything i requested. I am going to use Castillo for any HVAC services in the future and recommend them without reservation.< /Text>< username>

<text>Having many years of experience as a home builder I can attest to the fact that having a contractor that designs, sizes and  installs the system properly is more important than shopping the name brand stamped on the side of the equipment. With Art and his team, you can rest assured that you will be getting all the above with the added bonus of some of the best equipment on the market, all at a very fair price.  When it came time for a new install at my own home,  I only needed to make one phone call.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>Hugo, the tech was nice, friendly and knowledgeable.  He explained everything he was doing to us. He was not in a rush and took time with us.  He was patient since we have dogs and I had to move them around.  Hugo had great customer service and kept asking us if we had any questions .  He was not a salesman, trying to sell us a bunch of unnessary parts.  He was honest and I will definitely call them again.  I liked how they update you on the ETA of the tech. You have a 2 hour window but they gave me a heads up that he was an route.  This was very helpful.  I highly recommend them.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The guys came out in a blistering heat and spent 8 hours carrying equipment, materials, crawling under the house to do repairs to the duct work and replacing the drip pan and coil unit for our system. I never saw them stop working the whole time. Hard working, courteous, friendly and talented. God bless Castillo -<//Text>

Over the last 10 years Castillo H-A/C has come out to my house 4 or 5 times to deal with various issues. Each time they took great care of us and we were confident about the fairness of their costs.   The professional integrity of the technicians that they send is world-class.  They are knowledgeable, honest, trustworthy and willing to answer questions and explain what is going on in terms that I can understand.  They do excellent work.

I am so glad to know that reliable businesses Like Castillo H-A/C still exist.< /review>

I have delt with Castillo Heating and Air Conditioning 3 times in the past several years and each time they have gone above and beyond their duties.  They provide great service starting with the office staff all the way to the techs. Every tech I have encountered was knowledgeable and friendly. I have had the privilege of speaking with Art on separate occasions and he has always made me feel comfortable and explained everything to me in great detail.  His staff and himself are perfect examples of what customer service should be.     Thanks.< /Text>

<review>Castillo Heating and Air Conditioning is the absolute best! I have to begin by praising the amazing office staff!  They are friendly, professional, and always return phone calls and emails within a reasonable amount of time!  Through the years, this company has serviced my a.c. unit, and they have always done great work!  This year, the old system finally quit on us.  Art Castillo, the owner came in and gave us a great quote that included different options to choose from.  He worked with our budget and exceeded our expectations.  The installers were always on time, respectful, and made sure to protect my carpet and keep things very clean.  I must also add that Castillo Heating and Air uses top quality products and offers great warranty packages!  My home is cool and comfortable now thanks to the Castillo family business!<//review>< Name>

I was referred by a friend but I still wanted to get quotes from other companies. All companies were close in price the first company tried to tell me I could only by the filter from them that was a lie the second company never got back to me on a discount for over a week. Castillo Heating & Air was on top of everything. I would call Art and ask questions and he would answer all questions. My Installation went great and all in one day. I had my inspection from the city and he told me I picked a good company that everything was done right and up to code. The inspector said a lot of installations are not done properly. Installations are the most important thing if you want it to work  properly and for many years. Thank you for all that helped especially Art.<//review>

Very honest stuff Hugo came and found out the problem right away and he was educating us through the process , we had another company come Two days before for a diagnostic and they had told us that the air unit was to old and that they couldn’t fix it  and that we had to replace it for a new unit, Castillo company found out right away that it was only the thermostat that needed to be replace, I definitely recommend this company is very honest and reliable< /Text>

At first they wanted to charge us 60 dollars because the  technician was waiting for 15 min and then they charged us $90 for diagnosis and then they Wanted to charge us $400 and saying we gotta order some parts for the AC unit and when we called another company they charged $75 for diagnosis and fixed our unit at no extra charge and on the same day with no extra parts needed. Rip offs!</Text>

Love this company.  They are incredibly honest and customer focused.  A few times over the years, I thought we were in for big bills and the fixes turned out to be really small.  They could have ripped us off and they didn't.  They have even changed some of our vents to get them pointing in different directions to make sure that they improved cooling for the room without charging us, just because they thought it was right.< /Review>

They've been back twice now since finding the first leak in refrigerant.  The second time for a very bad water leak. Hugo replaced the 25 year old condensation pump and hose.  Yesterday(October 21) he came back for a check of our heating system. I highly recommend them.  They are courteous, knowledgeable, and thorough.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Professionalism, promptness,  excellence, polite.

In this day and age, how many of us can say that about a business?

So after almost 20 years of having a broken AC unit and furnace and using portable room ACs in my house, I called Castillo Heating and Air after getting another quote from a different company.

When I called, I was impressed with the professionalism on the phone.  I was scheduled to meet with Art.

Art arrived about 30 minutes early instead of an hour late like the other guy.

Art is an old school professional, polite, firm hand shake, eye contact, oh and did I tell you he beat the last estimate by nearly 4k and with a more energy efficient unit?

I am now the proud owner of a Trane 3 ton 16 sear unit with new furnace.

Installers were so professional and artived early,  the AC and furnace completed a few hours earlier than the estimate.

Castillo Heating and Air is what almost all companies USED TO BE, so professional,  prompt service and quality work.

I was always taught, "If you are on time, you are late."  Amazing to find an organization that has the same Old School philosophy.

If you want amazing professional service with an established family owned and operated company, call them, hire them and be blown away.</review>< Date>

This Company is Solid Gold!

I am an electrical contractor in the Orange County area, and my elderly parents that live in Menifee, were recently were taken advantage of by an unscrupulous air conditioning contractor that did some shoddy work on a recent AC replacement project. The contractor had not pulled proper permits, had not followed up the installation with a HERS, inspection, and had basically run off with the $3,500.00 that they had required my parents pay up front for. Castillo was referred by a friend, and they provided my folks with a reasonable quote. Shortly after the quote was accepted, the Castillo Team was hard at work fixing the mess that was caused by this
unethical contractor. Shortly after the installation was completed they passed the cit y building inspection as well as and passing the HERS inspection with flying colors. They were even so kind as to assist my folks with a sworn affidavit stating the horrible work that was completed by this other contractor.

These are people that you can trust!

Thank you Castillo AC for not only doing great AC work for my folks, but for just being nice, kind, and caring people.</text>

<Review>I had my 2 outdoor AC units replaced by one Trane 5 ton variable speed communicating XV20i with its corresponding indoor coil and variable speed furnace XC80. Art was very thorough in explaining  the system that he suggested to replace my old unit. He was honest to answer all the questions and concerns that I have that helped me in my research. It sure helped me in making my final decision. The Castillo Heating & Air Conditioning technicians Ernesto and Tony who installed the units were outstanding! They communicated well with me and accommodated my schedule. They were prompt, on time and worked systematically. They took great care in covering the carpet areas where they worked and they kept their work areas clean. They were very professional in dealing with us and I was very impressed with the quality of their work. My wife I are extremely happy and satisfied with this Trane AC and furnace.  It is very quiet compared to the old units that it replaced.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1554869104826, 'text': "We can't thank you enough Mr. Del.

The initial visit with the company's owner was very pleasant. Art explained all the possible systems we could purchase, as well as what the benefits were for each type of HVAC system. Art also made sure we were clear about the financing programs that were available. All in all, working with Castillo HVAC was a very satisfactory solution to our heating/air conditioning problems. Office staff was also very helpful.

All three crew members worked diligently to complete the installation in timely, professional manner over two days. The workers cleaned up the work area thoroughly when they were finished. We were given complete directions on how to use the new smart thermostat. The tech was very patient with us.

Thank you very much Castillo HVAC!

Follow-up visits have been timely and helpful. We received assistance with the digital thermostats  and with the SCE summer program monitor installation. Thanks again!< /review>

<review>It’s been about 15 months since I had my A/C system installed by Castillo Heating & A/C and just wanted to report back that everything works wonderfully just as advertised. They installed 3 zones at my home with one of the zones designated for the Master Bedroom which was very important for me since I have MS which makes me sensitive to heat and I tend to spend most of my time there its great to be able to set the temperature a little lower in this room than the rest of the house.  The A/C system that was installed is very energy efficient and the installation process starting from the initial quote to the completion of the installation went smoothly. I would definitely recommend them to family and friends.< /review></record>

We are also so proud to have someone like Teresa on our team, thank you for acknowledging her service.'}< /response><review>I requested information regarding my girlfriends Trane AC when she was having problems with it. Castillo had no involvement in it’s purchase or installation but their employee Teresa went out of her way to twice email me information regarding warranty and installation. It was exactly what I needed. Service like that is very rare these days especially in this heat wave when demand for their services is at an all time high.The next time I have any issues with my HVAC, they will be my first call.  Thank you Teresa!!<//review>< rate>

Nate was actually early and very responsive to identifying the problem, figuring the problem and finding the part that was needed. He worked late to assure my property was cooling before he left. Thank You Guy's for making this a painless and successful process. Mark< /Text>

First time trying it. Bought some of the snacks. The fried meat balls, hmm my husband thought they were dog treats. That's what they looked like. They tasted gross. The other snacks were just ok. To much money for what we got. Basically reheated frozen food. Will not be back. The service was good. They even were super polite to a woman who refused to put a mask on. Good job employees.</review>

Ordered a large brown sugar fresh milk. The drink looked good but they use poor quality boba pearls. Each boba was still hard in the middle. Overall, I was disappointed with the drink and didn’t finish after the first 3 sips. BSB doesn’t stand out compared with other boba places in the area. They fixed the loud music part which I saw in others’ review before I came in. Might give them another try some time later...</Text><gmap_id>0x809ad9a4a6468c25:0x6552d472c1b3f669</gmap_id>< time>

This was my first time going! So the employees are pretty nice. I ordered a chocolate milk tea. It was basically chocolate milk with extra chocolate. A little sweet but good! Boba was nice, but it was a little hard in the middle. Overall I give it only because the boba thrower both me, and the 2 other people in the car off. Again, good tho. And I plan to go again!</review>

So I’ve been to this place about 4 or 5 times and I have to say that I really enjoy their drinks! The first time I went was about a week after the soft opening, and I waited about 25 minutes. I didn’t mind because they were probably still figuring things out. The next few times I went, the service was much quicker, so I really appreciate that! I have gotten the cookies and cream and mango slush crushed peach. Personally I think their drinks are a little too sweet, but luckily they allow you to adjust the sweetness, which not all boba places do! The employees are super helpful if you have questions. I also really appreciate that the owners listen to customer suggestions! With that being said, please add egg pudding toppings to the menu :) Also, maybe a description after drinks that aren’t super obvious what the flavor is, (like blue kids kreamz). I definitely can’t wait to try more flavors!<//Review>

<Text>Wow just wow. We went as a family and apparently they had some friends of either a worker or owner who were in line in front of us. They got out of line to talk to their friend for about 5 minutes. Then when it would have been our turn they hopped back in line and ordered. Like magic they got the "last 2" bears of the day. It was despicable and we will not go back our weekly trips will be to any other establishment. My autistic son asked for 2 days why the ladies didn't have to wait in line yet got bears.    Wanted to add. Since the owner responded. If an employee has someone get out of line to talk to both them for several minutes and lead them back into line, so your employee felt like someone talking gto them meant they did not need to wait in line. I did mention it to the register employee  who shrugged their shoulders. I was(technically still am) following on social and had stated that. I understood/understand at the time that there was a limit but it seem suspicious that 2 friends of an employee who didn't feel they needed to wait in line were also the last 2 bears of the day. It was a clear example of nepotism. Also the drinks were so sweet my kids were unable to finish them.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1619395939530, 'text': 'Hello Amber,\n\nAccording to our policies, we had an limit of 25 Bearbricks a day, and it’s only available for our social media followers who have been waiting for a long time to take a Bearbrick home. After April 1, there are no limit for both Bear bottles and Buddy bottles.\n\nAccording to your statement, we’re assuming the incident may happened before April 1. As for the customer that was in line ahead of you, got out of line then return, their placements was still in line ahead of you. However, if you had felt that the customer that was in line in front of you were cutting for leaving the line then you should have asked them to get behind you directly and personally because we have no authority over sending someone to the back of the line if they were in line in front of you first.\n\nSince the incident wasn’t at our fault, we refuse to apologize for what happened.\n\nGod bless you !\n\nEdit:Hi Amber,\n\nTo refer to your first comment, the customers were already in line ahead of you. In addition, We have discuss the matter with our employees and the reason for the customer getting out of the line was to discuss about their called in regarding orders, menus and the bears. It was not for casual conversation. Thus, after the discussion they were ready to pay and got back in line in their placement where they were in line ahead of you. We do not favor friends or families. All our guests are treated equally. Thus, if they are ahead of you in line then they have the right to order ahead of you. Also, we allow pre order of the bears as well and anyone can put in their orders a day ahead for reservation. That was also part of their discussions as they have place orders as well.\n\nThank you for your understanding.'}</response><Gmap_id>0x809ad9a4a6468c25:0x6552d472c1b3f669< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>My first experience at this place when it first opened was amazing, my order was brown sugar with coconut milk, I ask for almond milk they told me they didn't have one so I ask for coconut milk instead and still tasted really good. Until the second time I went and ordered the same drink this lady told me that they were not doing the drink anymore it's because it doesn't taste good she said. My point is that they should provide more milk choices. So then I ordered Taro milkshake with coconut milk and they told me they don't do that as well, so then I ordered mango smoothie with NO MILK and they put milk on it and I can't drink milk that's why BSB
need more milk choices. Would I go to this place again, I don't think I would. Thank you for the experience.<//text></record>

<review>The customer service is top notch. The waiting period takes quite a while. The sugar boba shop just opened up at the time of this review. The environment is welcoming and humbling. Lack of seating available and prices are a bit expensive.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

If I could give a negative star I would. I waited for over an hour to get up to the register to order and they had run out of Thai Tea the only thing that I wanted!!!!! I will never spend why time or money at this place again. The music is so loud that the person taking your order cannot hear you.<//text>

<Review>I like the peach boba~! its super good, and ( unlike one review said) it aint hard in the middle.  the reason why i gave a 4 star though was that when i ordered a passion fruit boba, they didnt add the boba. they are still new though, so im not fussing that much! next time, im getting the bear block!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Was excited about finally having a Boba spot in C.H. area but when I visited, I was very disappointed. Ordered the Lychee Tea w/boba, flavor was way too sweet, not much boba, too much ice, and Cups too small for the $5.75 price. I'll just drive out to the Cool Tea Bar in South Sac for my boba next time I'm craving it.<//text>< Pictures>

Didn’t have a good experience. Music was loud or the cashier was talking too low where I couldn’t understand him. I asked for crystal boba and he said okay. When drinks came and I got regular boba? I told them that I order crystal boba and not boba. The lady say oh we’re out of crystal boba. First of all, the gentleman could of told me that they were sold out, that way I could of chose something else because I don’t like boba ( crystal boba are totally different from regular boba ). Second, the lady could of offer me something else because I did not ask for this but they made it anyways thinking that was okay? Also, we got the brown sugar boba and that taste nothing like the brown sugar boba. Plus, the boba was not formally form or I’m not sure because ours was breaking apart ( which was gross ). We definitely didn’t even finish our drinks. I did order some fried meatballs and took them a long time to fried them and I believe on the broad it said 12 pieces and I got 10 instead. Me waiting for a long time to get our drinks and the food was not worth it at all.<//review>

over all it was ok. they had good vibe's. but the prices are to high and when i tryed to call them they didnt answer idk if  they were bissy or if they just didnt here it bc of the music. but i had to pay 17 dollars for my drink that could have been like 6 dollard. but the worker's there were really nice and tryed there best to go fast with the order's. but i think for now ima stike with kp market.< /Text>

On the web it says they close at 8pm got here at 7pm and they are close. Should atleast change the time on the website. Came from south sac to north highland. Don’t go base off on their web, they don’t open u til 12 and probably close at 5 pm or 6 pm.<//text>

Everyone is so friendly & attentive! They make sure to always do an amazing job! I love Emily’s work every single time that she does my nails, they always come out PERFECT & I always get so many compliments on them. I would highly recommend Venetian Nails!!💅🏽< /Review>

This was my first time here and I’m definitely coming back! I called the day I needed an appointment and they took me within the hour! I got exactly what I wanted for my nails, and they were very patient to explain all of options and color selections. This is a very clean salon and they follow all safety procedures right now. Emily made my experience great and did an amazing job on this set!</review>

From 5 stars to 2.

Update: When the owner was doing my nails the first time he told me I could get them filled when it was time. I called while on my way to the shop and was told the price of a fill. I came in to get then filled and was told they do not fill dipped nails. I said to just take them off then and the owner came over and said they could fill them but for a higher price than I was told over the phone for the same service. I loved my nails the first time but the inconsistencies truly bother me. I do not like when people change the price and services once they have you in the chair. I did get a pedicure today and it turned out nice. However I don't think I will be returning here in the future, as I do not like when people play games with my time or money.

Original Post: LOVED my experience! Today was my first visit, I found them off an internet search and I am so glad I did! The service is great and so is the quality of the nails. You can tell they really care about how their customers leave the shop. I am so happy and will definitely be going back.</text>

<Text>I had a very mixed experience. The ladies were extremely nice and helpful however I’m not really satisfied with my nails. I just got them done yesterday and they already look like I need a fill in. It wasn’t busy at all which was nice and the shop is very clean. I just feel like they rushed my manicure. I’ll probably go back once more because the customer service was great, perhaps it was just an off day.</Text><gmapID>0x80c33583ca996c9b:0x4f3b4ceaf194d81c< /gmapID><user_id>102784403969698269216< /user_id><rate>3< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This was my first time coming here and they took me in on a busy Friday evening. I love the atmosphere and the selection of colors they offer. My nail tech is Tori and I Definitely love her vibe. All the other nail techs were super sweet they all came over and chit chatted with me. The service was incredibly amazing that I brought my boyfriend back here for a pedi within the next day and they sat us down immediately! Go check them out you will definitely love them.< /Review>< Pictures>

Very professional and clean. I don't look for quantity but quality and cleanliness. My nails are perfect every time I leave this place. People in a rush need not apply. Places like this stay in business for a long time for a reason, they are in it for the long haul because they care. Thank you Bryan!< /Review>

Not sure why this place doesn’t have more stars!!! The owner genuinely cares that all his customers are happy with his work!!! Made an appointment for a fill and took 40 mins. And I still had time to drive through some food on the way back to work!< /Text>

I have gone there twice and their service is so genuine and they are truly one of a kind. The ladies are so sweet and give you advice on whether design on your nails will look good or not. Very caring environment!!! 10/10</Review>

I liked the friendliness and the great customer service BUT, my nails were too thick and a few days later, they were lifting. One nail came off, so I had to go elsewhere to get it replaced.
I wanted them flat (not bulky like the pics) and to look natural. I had to have them redo one and unfortunately I didn't have time to redo all so i just left unsatisfied.< /text>

<text>Best nail place, hands down! I work in orange county and live in the high desert. I've tried so many nail salons and this one is, by far, the best! Kind, accommodating, hard working people who seem to always get my nails just right! I'm very picky since I have small hands, but I have never been disappointed.

This nail salon is like paradise and everyone is so friendly. Been wanting to try out the nail dip instead of acrylics but have been to scared to because of the bad service I’ve seen people receive from other nail shops, but this nail shop does amazing work and have truly convinced me to keeping doing gel dip. They also did amazing gel work and art on my feet. It’s best if you make an appointment but it was so kind of them to take us in when they were busy but again appointment preferred. I definitely recommend Tori and Tammy. Tori did the gel dip and Tammy did my pedicure. Both were such a blast and had me smiling from ear to ear. This nail salon is the best and I definitely highly recommend. I will never go to any other salon again. Can’t wait to go back!!</text>

<review>Came for my daughter to have her nails dipped. Finished job was enough for her to be happy. I on the other hand wasn't impressed. When they first said they were finished I could still see the white base color through the color and top coat. I politely asked him to fix the color. Which he did.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I found this salon by accident while I was visiting the area. I needed someone to take off my gel polish that was over due . They did it quickly and put on polish temporary. I came back 3 days later with my mom and we had a mani/pedi. The pedicure was wonderful , the polish was done perfect and all the “tools” were new and came out of sterilized packets.
The manicure was a dip polish, my first time with this polish and I am now in love with it. The attention to detail and no-rush attitude left my mom and I wishing that  we could find a similar salon near home. I go to Ontario frequently and honestly I may wait till I return to get my nails done! The ONLY negative thing I have to say is that since they just re- modeled the whole salon  and opened the services under new ownership the services were not listed on paper and my moms “person” tried twice to convince her to do more. But I said no thank you and that was it. No big deal.
Thanks for a wonderful mani-pedi and it’s been 10 days and it’s still perfect! Love it!!</Text>< Pictures>

The people there were very helpful and took their time working on my nails! This time I got the dipping powder in matte and I got 2 other ladies to try out the powder! They’ve done a fantastic job and almost immediately get seated every time I go :). I definitely recommend this place and will become a regular!<//Review>

*******NEW OWNERSHIP******

I've always wanted to try the nail dip instead of the acrylic full set. Nail dip feels so much better than acrylic and my nails look so natural instead of looking thick with acrylics. Staff is so friendly and welcoming.
Tory did my nails! I will definitely be back again.</Review>

In CA with my husband for his job. From NC so I didn’t know where to get my nails done and chose this place because it was close to our hotel. So glad I did! The staff was super friendly and did a beautiful job on my nails. Wish I lived closer because I would definitely be a regular here.  I’m probably going for a pedicure tomorrow. I highly recommend this business.<//Text>

So, I give this place 3stars. I went yesterday to get a wax, and full set. Woke up this morning with bruised, and swollen eyebrows. The lady was just so heavy handed on my eyes, she pulled some of my skin with the tweezers, and even missed hairs. Would not recommend getting any kind of waxing (which wasn't a wax, was threading btw). I only give 3 stars because she did do a pretty good job on my nails, so if it wasn't for that, they would definitely get 1star. Oh!, and they arnt sanitary. I pray I don't get an infection. I will not be going back.</text>

Nail salon is now open under “New Owners” completely remodeled and very comfortable welcoming shop. I went in for a fill and to fix a broken nail. Tori the owner is very sweet and professional. She did my nails ombré/dipping powder and they came out amazing and she did it all in less than an hour. I highly recommend this nail salon. I will definitely be back, this is my go to nail salon. My picture is posted purple ombré.< /text>

<Review>Really pretty salon. Tiffany did a wonderful job making my nails pretty. Kim did a terrific job on my pedicure and even helped me to create a special color by using two polishes on my toes to give me that little extra special touch.

<Review>Most awful experience aside from my pedicure which was great. Smelled like a hospital or nursing home upon entering. The nail tech didn’t listen to my request to fix my nail upon noticing it was crooked. She kept saying she would fix it later; my nail is still crooked. I got a full coffin shaped full set and I can bend my nails like they’re plastic. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.</Review>< Rating>

I came here yesterday after work. I got here at about 6:30. The owner Bryan said they normally close at 7 but he would be willing to stay open for me. They just opened about a week ago and they were trying to build a new client base. I wanted a full set dip and pedi. He was soo friendly and personable. Got a pedi from Nancy he was very thorough gentle and Bryan did my nails. I was a little hesitant just because I hadn’t had a male nail tech before. He was diligent quick and did a great job. With all of the people they took AFTER business hours it was about 8:30 before I left. All in all it was a great job and I will be back! Thanks Bryan!</review>

< Review>
I would give them zero stars if I could. This place is AWFUL. DO NOT GO.  Should have been a clear sign to me when I arrived on Saturday afternoon and there was no one else there. The staff was rude, and tried to push other services on us nonstop. But the kicker is that my nails LITERALLY turned yellow the very next day. And by today, 4 days later, one broke in half. It is shoddy, cheap work that they will not fix.  I called and requested that they fix my nails, or issue a refund, and they started playing games in pretending they did not understand me. I finally hung up, I am posting these bad reviews, and then plan to file a charge back with my credit card company.</Review>

<review>Overpriced, unclean, and poor job overall. We got a lot done. Tammy, the owner, wouldn’t go down on price of my husband’s pedicure got $45 one. He was so ticklish he didn’t get his feet scrubbed or massage just his nails cut. Lily cut the edge of my big toes sideways; For sure going to get ingrown toenails. They said they were going to give us a $5 discount and didn’t. Also their wax warmer was filthy. 🤮 I seriously regret getting going there.< /review>< pics>

I wish I could give them less stars. This place was incredibly awful. The first thing I noticed was the fact that they couldn't seem to decide whether they wanted to be a jewelry/knick knack store or a nail salon. Either way the atmosphere was very unprofessional.

The second thing that became clear was the lack of cleanliness. All the tools were clearly used and the nail file even fell to the floor and the woman just picked it up and placed it back in the tray. Absolutely disgusting and hoping I don't get an infection.

Third, the pedicure I got was so painful! The woman didn't seem to care that I was visibly in pain and trying to yank my foot away. The callus remover block was unusually rough and she decided to concentrate her attention on the arch of my foot. Not the heels or anywhere that actually might have calluses. My feet are still in pain and torn on the bottom. I doubt she even had a license.

They didn't even seem to have a drying table anywhere. I had to leave with my nails entirely wet.

I have no end to the negative things I can say about this place. Just please take my word for it and skip this terrible place.<//text>< Pictures>

First of All, I got my nails done like half an hour ago and they’re still not dry… The topcoat was cheap. You can find it for a dollar at the fashion store. And second of all when my nails messed up while drying ( due to the cheap top coat ) the lady had the nerve to give me an attitude and a smart remark. “ you want to stay here forever “ ... implying that I wasn’t wanted.<//text>

The overall service here was terrible. I walked in and asked if they did facial waxing, which the old lady said they did. As I was getting ready for the wax, I was instead met with a thread. I didn't say anything after because I figured that she must know what she's doing and I was in a rush. The cost was extremely overpriced for a facial  threading. Once I got home, I immediately noticed that she didn't even do a good job. I would not recommend this place to anyone.</Text>

There was only one nail technician for two guest. Each pedicure took about two hours per session. The the initial guess did not get a full pedicure but paid for package three which was one of the most expensive choices out of the selection. The nail technician that worked on me, constantly kept messing up on my pedicure, she ended up putting more than four coats of nail polish on my feet .  She didn't seem experience. There was another nail technician on their phone eating in my opinion we could've been working on the second guest but instead as stated above there was only one nail technician working on two guest which delayed my for their activities for the day. All in all they still charge  us full price. We ended up paying $75 for a half job/botched job pedicure.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I walked in for a gel mani/pedi today the woman looked up for two seconds and said, "We're busy." That amazing customer service must be good for business! Didn't bother helping me set up an appointment or anything and I wasn't in a rush.

<text>I'm trying to plan a b-day for my sister and I live in another state, so I call for pricing and info on services and the gentlemen said they don't really do massages anymore even though it's on their website, I ask "what are your services?" He says that I would have to stop by, I explain that I can't and he says "oh well then ok thanks goodbye", I felt it was unprofessional and rude, we definitely won't be going there</text>< resp>

Location is average. Not a huge selection for colors and mostly off brands. FANTASTIC prices. Ask for Roxanna "Roxy" really sweet and fun loving girl who gives a badass pedi!! I'll definetely be back as long as she is there ❤<//Review>

We came to this salon due to reviews; but thought it only right to leave an accurate review
We had 3 people. All 3 of us got deluxe mani/pedies & paid 104$ to get file burns & inexperienced nail techs
They were inexperienced with the chrome process, they weren't willing to listen to what we were saying, they messed up the color choices, more then once.
It definitely was not a relaxing experience, they don't have a smooth process of doing A mani & pedi process & they don't seem to sanitize properly, nails ended up crooked & we left sore and in pain with less then par manicures and pedicures and paid over 100$ for them. We won't be back. And we would not recommend.< /text>

I've been doing my nails for over 10 years. This place is HORRIBLE. Skip it like the plague. Over priced, ancient nail techs who couldn't put on a nail straight if their life depended on it. Just buy some of the swamp meet jewelry and walk out before your fingers fall off.<//Review>

<review>Came for a fill, and they did a horrible job! My nails look like I just painted them and dragged them across the carpet. The shape of my nails are lopsided and I didn’t have the heart to tell her I didn’t like them.. but she did know but my actions</review>< pics>

Maybe it was my fault for going when it was busy but I got pushed into the dip nail and when I pointed out a mistake I was rudely helped and the mistake was made even worse now I have a climb of nail dip all clumped on my nail very disappointing I will not go back to save my life.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Bad service, uneven nails, injured fingers and the customer pays even if he is not satisfied. A shame. I will not come back.

Mal servicio, uñas disparejas, dedos lastimados y el cliente paga aunque no esté satisfecho. Una lástima. No regreso más.< /text>< Gmap_id>

We usually order the slushie cause its dairy free. Our favorites are the mango and rose mango flavors so far. They have a functional bathroom despite the out of order sign. They have a rewards program but only count the tea drinks, it's okay since they still send you offers.</review>< Time>

<review>My daughter and I searched for a place to visit that look appealing on the net. We had one afternoon to explore San Fransisco. We made this choice from the selection and presentation FrosTea created. We learned that the owner is less a year into this business. Her  enthusiastic and energetic attitude prevailed and were consistent with generous portions and polite service. This establishment will succeed and grow quickly. I welcome getting to be a part of supporting its development.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I asked for a slightly sweet almond avocado green milk tea. It was actually far too sweet, so much so that I couldn't finish it. The almond flavour was so overpowering that I could taste neither the avocado nor the green tea. Serving is pretty generous though: medium here is the equivalent of what I'd tend to call large.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Delicious bubble tea place. Came across this shop every time I get off the bus. Huge servings for a great price! I added a picture of the large bubble tea next to a 1 gallon water bottle. The first tea place that had three selections of sweetness. I took normal and it was personally a little too sweet for me. I choose half sweet and that's perfect.< /text><UserId.>113231228657077119157<//UserId.>< Pics>

I had the green milk tea and it was good. My husband tried the Thai tea, which sadly isn't premixed so he found powder in his drink and had to shake it up himself.<//Text>< pics>

The drink was really good but I was a little bit disappointed in the popcorn chicken. The drink I got was really tasty but it had a lot of ice in it. I got the Mango/Passionfruit flavor black tea with lychee jelly and I must say it was a really good choice combo on my part! The only complaint I have is with the ice because not a lot of people like a lot of ice in their drinks. As for the popcorn chicken, it looked so good and ready to eat with the sauce I ordered to go along with it. After a several bites into the popcorn chicken, it just didn’t taste good anymore. It was slightly over cooked even with the right amount of seasoning and sauce. I highly recommend just a couple of test runs after closing to perfect the popcorn chicken. That’s about all I have to say in my review! A huge thanks to UberEats for delivery.<//Text>

The honeydew shaved snow and mochi toppings are so-so for me. I'll try another flavor and their milk tea next time for a more accurate review. Parking space can be found at CVS nearby.< /Text>

Selection is limited and they use powder flavor on their drinks they do not even have seasonal fruits as an options.  Ohh and no calamari.<//text>

Not premium teas and milks like Boba Guys, but it's a decent milk tea with huge serving sizes for a good price! I ordered the green milk tea with honey and lavendar flavor and added 1 topping, housemade grass jelly. Haven't tried their shaved snow or ice cream macarons yet because the macarons look a little stale in the freezer. Also it's usually too chilly and foggy in this area for frozen desserts!! But I saw that they have a stock of board games in the corner and a few tables for groups, so would love to come back to hang out.

TIP: Join the FiveStar app and sometimes they will send you a free drink! (No purchase necessary)</Review>

Service was great.  The nurse spent a lot of time with me to ensure she knew exactly what my issues were.  She was kind, thorough, and made sure all my questions were answered.  While it did take about 15 minutes to talk to the Dr. (via video screen) the Dr. had all the information prepared by the nurse and we quickly got to a preliminary diagnosis.  The Dr. was helpful and made sure all my questions were answered.  Overall, a very good experience.<//text>

<Review>We are withholding a star because the quality of the video and audio was poor which made it difficult to understand. Also receiving a printout summary or email of the visit with the diagnosis and treatment would have been helpful. The medication prescribed by the provided was not available at Safeway and so we have no idea what it was. That being said, Nurse Bri was exceptional, very professional and great with children.< /Review>< rate>

<review>We’ve had nothing but great service at the Tennant Station facility. All of the nurses are patient, kind and very professional. Brie, Melissa and Christy are excellent nurses.....a special shout out to Christy Hunt, the nurse I’ve worked with the most. She’s been very helpful and informative with my in going condition. It’s important to feel relaxed and well taken care of....and I get that with them.
Thank you Action Urgent Care!< /review>< Pictures>

First off let me just say plainly that this urgent care clinic was truly Out of this World Fantastic!!!  I made an appointment ahead of time online which was extremely easy despite the fact that I felt like death itself.  The clinic itself was being run by the sweetest and most caring young LVN I have ever come across.  She was kind, efficient, and patient despite the fact that she was keeping the place running all by herself.  She was a secretary/front office worker/LVN, and more all rolled into one.  After this amazing young lady got all my info, checked my stats, and did more than her due diligence she got in touch with the funniest, most amicable/helpful physician via video chat.  This doctor made me feel more comfortable/at ease through a TV screen than any other doctor has been able to in person.  I just wish I could remember the names of these two amazing people.  Trust me if you are in need of a clinic of this type,  and are in or around the Morgan Hill area,  don't bother looking at other alternatives.  You won't be disappointed.< /review>

<text>Action Urgent Care is awesome!  My husband and I were able to make an appointment for the very next day, we didn’t have to drive to San Jose and we were able to get our meds renewed same day. The nurses are polite and professional  At both appointments, Christy was my nurse - she rocks!  I would definitely go again!< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I'm convinced all these positive reviews are fake.  We waited for an hour only to learn there is no doctor at the location and the visit is done through a video conference.  The best part is they couldn't even get the video conference working.  There was someone else in the waiting room who was told she would have a 2 hour wait.  Basically everything in their name is a lie.  There is no action, urgency, or care.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

We didn't know this place was located in the Safeway store so we showed up late to our appointment.  The nurse was so friendly she assured us that it was no problem.  They happily took our insurance (Tricare). We filled out a few questions and she connected us with a doctor by video chat. He was very friendly and tried hard to relax our 11 year old, who was very anxious about getting a TB test for school. After a brief interview with her, the doctor said she was not at risk for TB, and sent us a form to take to the school.   This put a smile on her face. We were very satisfied and will happily use them again.</review>

It was very quick, (which I liked) and I did get the medicine I needed so this met the criteria for my visit.  My only complaint was the very poor bedside manner of the attendant.  I came in with a very soar throat and she insisted on having me shout answers to her across the room.  She also rolled her eyes at me a few times and made it seem out of her way to reschedule the appt with another doctor which I thought was very unprofessional.  After all, she did ask if that appt worked for me.  How dare I say no?  This location was convenient and quick but staff has a very poor demener<//Text>

My experience was neutral, not the best but not completely the worst either. One of the ladies booked my appt. @7:30pm, I show up on time & they still make you wait a while( keep in mind they close @8pm.) the Lvn said my appt. wasn’t even booked. So that gives the impression of an unorganized establishment.</text>

I had a wonderful first time experience at AUC.
While all of the other local urgent care centers were closed for the weekend, AUC was there in my time of need. Bri greeted me at the door and she was so patient with me and swiftly walked me through the process. Bonus, she’s also an excellent nurse with efficient and pleasant bedside manor. It was high tech in comfort. My virtual Dr experience was good as well. It felt like we were in the same room. All in all, every reason why I’ll go back for future visits and I have already recommended AUC to my coworkers. Thank you.
Best Regards,
Worthington< /review>

Excellent service.  Easy to make appt.  Nurse meets you and confirms data, vitals and issue to be seen for.  Sends information to urgent care doctor who then reviews and then speaks w you via online system in private office!  Tech that works!  Had dog bite on hand ...reviewed...recommended antibiotics and next steps to care for it.  Dr. then emailed prescription to my pharmacy.  Very comfortable and easy ...will use again :)< /text>

< Review>
I'm disappointed by choosing this Sevice
The receptionist/assistant, wouldn't know how to proses my secondary insurance

Then we were taking to a tiny room with a screening on the wall
To my surprise, I was going to be heard NOT SEEN by a doctor

My issue is in my throat but doctor couldn't check she was on a TV screen

Then they make a return appointment with a cancelation fee, if I forget to cancel

THEN, my medication supposedly was set to my Pharmcy, but when I went to pick it up, there was two medications missing, so I asked, and was told that's all they sent,you need to call them back and have the resend the full prescription order, so I did call the Clinic again and was told they will check and let me know what went wrong.
But 2.5 hours later no return  call.

"(All this happening while I was sick with massive headache and coughing my lungs out)" needing my medications

So I had to call AGAIN the clinic, and the girl said "I'm sorry, I'll check again and let you know."

She call back saying, I just resend the prescription by voice mail

Then I checked with pharmacy, and was told, yes they left a voicemail but with no quantity, so we can fill your prescription till we have a full quantity order.
So I had to call back the Clinic and the girl said... oh ok let me call the Pharmcy back .
By then the Pharmcy was about to close and couldn't proses my prescription till next day
SO I WENT FOR THE SECOND TIME ON THE  NEXT DAY TO OBTAIN MY MEDICATION AT 1pm the next day

I had a miserable night been sick coughing all night and without been able to sleep

I CAN NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE TO GO TO THIS PLACE
IF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE WORKING WITH HUMANS THAT NEEDS  HELP NOT ANIMALS
EVEN ANIMALS CAN'T  BE TREATED CARELESS< /Review>

Staff was friendly. However, I did not realize we would video-conference with the doctor. This took a bit time for the staff to arrange while we required immediate assistance. I would not recommend coming here if you require immediate assistance as you are better off going to the emergency room as the doctors are not available onsite.<//Text>

I took my daughter here at 7:00 on a Saturday night with a bad earache.  All of the other local Urgent Care places had closed around 5:00 pm and I was very relieved to see that Action Urgent Care was open until 9:00 pm.  It was a clean, spartan waiting room with just chairs and a potted plant, but I imagine it's easy to keep clean and keep people from spreading germs reading the same magazines.   The doctors were friendly and helpful and got us just what we needed to help my daughter feel better.  She loved getting stickers for being a good girl.  It was well worth the 45 minute drive from our house and I would definitely go here again if I needed Urgent Care.</text>

<Review>Inexperienced staff. No one else in the office, but still waited over an hour for a virtual/remote doctor's visit via web cam. Doctor did not provide a diagnosis, but prescribed medication that has proven insufficient. Took several days to get a receipt for the visit. I found the entire experience to be more of an administrative joke than anything remotely related to professional medical care (yes, pun intended). Go somewhere else.</Review>< user>

I knew I had strept throat and needed antibiotics right away. Kasier makes you wait 24 hours for results. They gave me my results in 15 minutes. I was able to fill the prescription and I was on my way to recovery. I think they are a little understaffed which made the registration process a little long but other than that, they were great. Appointments can be made online!<//Review>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>Discovered this place when Googling urgent care in Morgan Hill, and since I needed to be seen rather urgently, thought I'd try it out. Located in Safeway next to the pharmacy, which is also convenient for prescriptions after your visit. Met with a virtual doctor after the nurse took my vitals and sent pictures to the doctor. Works well and was probably the same amount of time I would have spent anywhere else.</Text>< Time>

They promised a walk in, when I got there they couldn't see me. So I made an appointment for the afternoon. 1 hour 15 minutes later than appointment time.  The Nurse was trying to manage appointments, do vitals, greet patients on her own. When the .Doctor finally appeared on the screen he had the worst bed side manner imaginable. He looked like I was an interruption to his day. Absolutely dreadful.< /Review>

This Urgent Care facility is in a local  grocery store and I am glad that I went there. My fiancee found this place that was open during the 4th of July weekend and it was so fast and efficient in every way. It sat alongside the pharmacy, so once a prescription was ordered, it was filled at the same place. Super convenient!! Thanks for getting me what I needed quickly.<//text>

Very good and quick help.  I had an ear infection from swimming in some dirty water.  I was able to go in right away and teleconference with a doctor.  They diagnosed it and gave me a prescription that cleared it up.  The only downside is they don't contract with my insurance Blue Shield of California/Covered CA, so I had to pay cash and now try to submit a claim.</text>

I was a bit concerned about not seeing a Dr. in person but I was able to have my exam via a Skype type of service.  They had the technology for her to look at my throat via camera scope and the Dr. was able to tell that I had strep, which I did have.  I also got a follow up call checking on me a few days later.  The whole thing took about an hour and a half verses the last time I went to the emergency room which took me16 hours to be seen and gave me no help at all.  This place is convenient and professional and the staff was friendly.  Thank you guys.  I am feeling much better.<//review>< pictures>

Friendly and efficient!  The professionals at Action Urgent Care assessed my situation, handled my paperwork and dealt with my medical needs quickly.  My wait time from door to examining room was about half an hour.  The nurses and physician only had to ask a few questions, then tests confirmed their suspicions, and I was medicated and done :).  My doctor ordered a follow-up test for next week.  Gonna be healthy again!</Review>

The only thing the nurse is interested is getting paid can u believe it . The nurse was calling the United health plan for 40 minutes trying to get a verified payment...I was patient to wait. In conclusion I ended up paying the visit. So don't bother going to this virtual urgent care clinic they don't accept hmo health plans.< /Text>

It was cool they got me in right away.  The lpn did a quick assessment of me made notes and informed the dr.  He popped up on the screen had very few questions since the lpn did such a great job.  Prescribed me meds explained each med for me and sent me on my way.  My scripts were ready in 5 min in the pharmacy.</text>

This is showing Morgan Hill and I was seen at the Blossom Hill location, but here's my experience there. Went in at 6pm on a Thursday with badly strained muscle in my neck and upper back. Was treated promptly and courteously. They also filled up quickly when the pharmacy had a problem filling one of my prescriptions because of an insurance issue. Great service and would highly recommend.< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>This place does virtual visits (Webcam) with a Nurse Practitioner, not a doctor. I had to argue with them to not pay my co-pay because I didn't have to. They seemed to know better so I called my insurance and they talked to them, no co-pay (because as as I told the Nurse and desk guy on site, I met my out of pocket maximum). The NP on Webcam didn't even read my chart the on-site nurse wrote up. It was a very subpar experience, something you should expect when going to urgent care in a supermarket. I won't make this mistake again.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808e20702c8b34db:0xc5fb104fa4eb5941< /Gmap_id></record>

<name>Shawn Lemaster</name><review>Impressively poor service/care all around. New trainee had absolutely NO idea what she was doing. Couldn't utilize the technology (iPad), couldn't do a patient assessment appropriately, actual patient interaction was poor - just all around a bizarre experience. Felt like I was in a highschool setting - the trainer was drinking Starbucks and wearing a hoodie while they talked about physicians and giggled.Took the two 1hr 45min of an office visit (excluding wait time) to assess. Again, probably the strangest and most incompetent healthcare experience I've had.< /review>< Pictures>

The PA is incompetent, you have to call them repeatedly and follow up.  She wasn’t helpful and didn’t provide any diagnostic of what’s wrong with you.  Then you have to pay again to get your results, avoid this place at all cost.<//Text>

<text>When I arrived at my appt time, a very professional nurse checked me in via an IPad.  Everything was done on that including my insurance info and my signature.  I was brought into a private room and sat facing a large screen tv in front of me.  After getting my vitals, a Doctor came on the screen and talked with me.  She was able to see the picture of my allergic rash that the nurse sent over and prescribed me my medication.  It was so smooth I loved it. I have to admit it's different, but I can accept this for minor problems.</text>< rate>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I tried this place thinking it was a regular medical facility, and found it was a facility done through a doctor via Skype. After waiting extensively, I spoke with a female who prescribed 2 medications for 2 possible issues. Process of elimination I guess was the diagnostic process used and boy who could of done better by guessing. If we could only prescribe our own meds, I thought. On top of this when I received the billing, I was charged $50.00 extra because it was a Sunday, December 24. When I called and complained that I had not been informed about the extra fees charged of which Insurance did not cover, the billing agent said it was because it was a Sunday.  The agent told me to look on google for the billing policy. I said , It should be posted at the facilities location and that an extra fee should not be charged if Action Urgent Care hours for Sunday are listed as regular hours open. Which they are, if you go to their Website you can see that Sundays are part of their hours listed for business. Yes, this is a business. Plus, my time is costly too and I waited a long time and this appointment was at 2pm and it was well after 3pm that I spoke with a person (female) over Skype. I will not do this again. An expensive co-pay.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

What kinda urgent care has a lunch break and is useless as this one. Should be available from open to close at all times. I drove farther from Gilroy becasue this was rated better. What a waste of time.</Text>

< review>
I had an appointment,  I arrived on time, filled out registration on a tablet, was triaged by a Medical Assistant, urinated in a cup, a dip stick was used and determined that I had a UTI, a doctor,  or a professional equal to a doctor was called, then on a television screen I spoke with this medical professional,  and I was prescribed Nitrfuranton for 5 days.
I was told yo return in 3 days.
The down side was only one person was there to help me and 3 or 4 more people who arrived, without an appointment, and answering questions on a tablet can be time consuming and tedious. I was concerned, what if someone arrived with something contagious the area was so small that I felt venerable.<//review>

The M.A. named Hila wrote nasty notes about me and lied about my symptoms to the doctor. Very unprofessional. If I could give no stars I would. Treated me like an idiot even though I have worked in the medical field before. Acted like I had no clue what I was talking about.</Review>

Had to go in to get a flu swab. Before I went to the hospital in San Francisco 4 chemo treatment and it took over 3 hours just to get a 15-minute swab. Had to postpone my treatment for 3 days. Even seen a patient walk out with her baby that was waiting too long< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) It was a very good experience, thanks to the kind Dr. Dubois who attended to me, she was very patient and with very nice manners, she shows that she loves her profession, she does it with a lot of respect and she looks like she enjoys, the clean place, there should be more people like that .

<Review>I have purchased 2 vehicles now with Integrity and both times I was pleased from start to finish. Enrique is super friendly, and helpful. He’s not pushy or aggressive, and I never felt pressured into buying. They always have a wide selection of vehicles, excellent quality and condition. For these reasons I’ll continue to do business with Integrity in the future!!<//Review>< Date>

I contacted Integrity to see what my options were about getting a vehicle. They worked with me on getting the vehicle I have been wanting to get. Manny was very friendly and did pretty much everything possible to help me out. Very happy with my purchase. Thank you!</text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>Impressive experience and deal altogether! Thank you Integrity! No regrets! Once I made a choice for the car, everything else was as smooth as they only show on TV! Everything took under ONE HOUR!!! (But yes, I was prepared with the needed documents). I drove off with the best vibes and now 8 months later I can only say Thank you once again. Well deserved review. I'll be back for an upgrade once the time will come.< /review>< Time>

Enrique, Shawn, and Liz were the salespeople that helped me and they were all awesome! They were each extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Got me into a great car that I love! I’m so pleased with my purchase. They didn’t pressure me into anything and worked hard to get me exactly what I was looking for and at a great price that fit my budget. Definitely recommend.</text>

Terrible customer service.  After they sale you the car they want nothing to do with you.  Enrique will not respond to you if you need anything thing from him.  I needed paperwork from him for my insurance and he lied to me numerous times and then stopped responding to me all together.  I had 3 other people lie to me also that said they are going to send me the paperwork.  Their mechanic is not to bright also.  Sold me a car that their mechanic said was in great condition.  This place is totally sketchy do not go here.</Review>

<Review>Very surprised that they have such a high rating on Google. I bought a vehicle here at the end of September 2020. Still don’t have my license plate March 1st. They said they mailed it to me in December and it was returned undeliverable. Huh? I don’t think so.  So instead of trying to call me to come pick it up (I live 40 miles away) they wait for me to call to find out what happened to my license plate. The lady Victoria is very rude. No apologies, just excuses. A simple phone call would have been appreciated.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>My husband and I went in yesterday hoping to get a good deal on a used car. We drove out in a beautiful suv with very low miles (70k), that didn’t cost your soul! We walked out paying a modestly low down payment and low monthly payments! And my husband has no credit history! (I’m told that’s worse than bad credit but idk 🤷🏾‍♀️). Everyone there was very helpful and super chill. The energy in the place was great! They even got us good insurance rates through AllState and registration and everything is covered when you finance! I highly recommend them to anyone in the market for a car!<//Review><Name>Ebony Rice<//Name><Rating>5</Rating>< response>

George helped me out and Enrique helped get the numbers where things worked. Mark in finance was also nice and gave good tips for first time buyers. All in all, buy a car isn’t ever easy but Integrity Autoz made things smooth. They even removed my old speaker system from my car at no charge. Definitely check them out< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Called to verify they had a vehicle in stock and made an appointment to test drive for the following day. Emphasized that we would be driving from 3 hours away with a newborn. Upon arrival, we were informed that the car we wanted to drive wasn't actually in stock but of course, they offered to sell us something more expensive! Not impressed!<//Text>

These guys are professionals at greeting and getting you to buy a car from them. This review rating is for THEIR SERVICE not their cars, the Hispanic guy that works there is extremely Sarcastic. Only because we wanted to get a lower deal on a car we wanted he told my husband "its too much of a car for him". These guys need more Respect and Maturity. FOR ANYONE THAT COMES HERE: If your trying to get a car just be aware of what type of attitude they may give to you if you don't come to an agreement. Can't imagine how they'll react if you buy a vehicle that ends up needing work, will they be willing to help you without being so rude?< /Review>

< review>
Absolutely terrible experience here.

We arrived 5 minutes after our scheduled time to test drive our car and was not greeted by anyone as we walked in. We then waited 10 minutes for our salesman to get the keys to the car we were test driving because the vehicle was being worked on. No big deal, it’s a used car so we let it go. The car drove great at the salesman we were with was helpful and pleasant.

Everything changed when we sat down to go over pricing. Our salesman informed us that he was not in charge of negotiations and promptly got his sales manager. This is where the one star review comes in.

I have bought over 12 cars in my life and this was hands down the worst experience I have ever had.

This sales manager was a combination of every cliche in the book. He was pushy, rude, and inconsiderate. He treated us like we were being unreasonable expecting to be able to negotiate the price of the car. I’m sorry, no one comes to a car dealership expecting to pay list price for a car.

The sales manager came over and sat down without greeting us and was hostile right out of the gate. Within the first 5 minutes of our conversation we were lied to on multiple occasions about when the car came onto their lot, how the car was purchased and how they base their prices.

A little backstory on the car. It had been on their lot for 5 months when we came in to test drive it. The price had been set the same for the duration of the time on their lot aside from a one time adjustment of one dollar two months prior to our test drive. He told us he was selling the car at his wholesale cost and what he paid at auction and said he is taking a loss because the car had been on the lot for a long time. When I mentioned the price hadn’t changed since they originally put it on the lot and that we were told by his salesman that they based their prices on kbb and market value. He told us that his salesman is lying and that he knows nothing about how their pricing works. He then proceeded to tell us that he was unwilling to negotiate the price of the car and had a very arrogant attitude about it.

When we mentioned that he was pricing the car in the range of what kbb suggests for retail cost he said we were lying and that the price he paid was what it cost at auction but in the same breath said he wouldn’t tell us what he paid at auction (?). When I pulled up the listing on kbb he just stared at me for a while. He then said something along the lines of he would go on kbb himself to show us. He came back after a few minutes with a document that didn’t have any branding from kbb on it with an astronomical number for “auction/wholesale” cost. We then looked up the same car and found a dozen listings under what his “auction/wholesale” price. The sales manager then proceeded to again tell us he will not tell us what his wholesale price was.

After a few more minutes of this we came to an impasse. He flat out old us that he was not going to take a single dollar off the list price of the vehicle then stared at us. Needless to say, we left shortly afterword.

Listen, I am the first to admit that negotiations can be intense but I have never had such a negative experience with a “professional” in my life. We will not be back to this dealership.<//review>

He failed to mention that their finance Co is closed on the weekend ugh. Total waste of time! I think they're paid by the number of people who physically come inside.  They didn't care about deceiving me or the position they put me in. I don't deal with dirt bags- not in my personal life nor in my professional one.< /Review>< pictures>

I am so grateful for integrity auto carz because they assisted in me in purchasing my first vehicle. I was really nervous and I didn’t think I would leave the lot in a car that I was content with I thought I would leave in whatever I was approved for. HOWEVER huge thanks to Enrique Cervantes sales representative of integrity he worked persistently and ambitiously to get me in a car that I was satisfied with. That’s right NO settling he got me in my dream car at an affordable cost. Thank you Enrique for showing great compassion and resilience 🥰<//Text>

When I brought the  2017 Nissan ultima , recently not even 24 hrs the car had check Engine light , so I called Leo one of the works that sold me the car. And I told him what was going on. He said “bring in the car so we can check it out”  We were there for hours. The transmission broke down at 72,000 miles 😡like new. And eric the manager the runs the dealership came to us and told us “to be honest with you, yesterday i told  my workers to not sale the car ,because another customer  had the same problem that you guys are having”  so i was very upset. He give me two opinion or you take the car you have and we fix it or you can choice from the other once. He was acting very rude!. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP!!< /text>

Greatest Car Buying Experience Ever!!!
My Salesman was Kurt Wilson.
Very friendly and no pressure at any time.
I was able to get into a clean low miles 2018 new car-
even with my challenged credit history .
I'm doing the happy dance!
I was in and out of there in only about two hours!

I went there and purchase a vehicle after 2 weeks the car broke down i took back the car to them 5 times to fix and they said they fix it already with the same problem. Now my wife and our baby almost got to an accident because of the same problem. I call them and asked for their help but they keep on lying to us. I keep calling them but they keep making excuses and telling us they gonna fix it. Now its about 1 month the car being park at our house waiting for them to come and fix but we haven’t heard from them. Im so mad cos they keep lying to us. I keep calling and text them they gave me the same answer. They supposed to help us customer with our need. So my recommendation is for all the people that plan to go there and try to get a new car is don’t go there they tell you everything good about their car and everything but the truth is they don’t tell you what the problem is. If you guys don’t believe me i have all the proof of our conversation.</Text>

The staff at Integrity Auto Sales were incredibly kind and helpful. They foster a friendly community at their dealership and always make an extra effort to ensure everyone's comfort and satisfaction. The vehicles on display were in immaculate condition and priced well. I definitely would recommend visiting them if you're looking for a wide range of quality vehicles backed by a competent and cool staff.< /review>

Will is the Sales Associate that assisted me today. Will and the Integrity Auto team went above and beyond to ensure I received the most value for my trade in, in addition to a great price for my new vehicle. They literally worked MAGIC and got me the BEST financing deal. I highly recommend Integrity Auto, specifically Will, his customer service gets 5+ stars from me! I left the dealership feeling great about my purchase! I will definitely be a repeat customer and will send my family and friends their way!</review>

Integrity Auto Sales lives up to their name. William Guillen immediately greeted me with a smile and helped me the entire way until I left with my BEAUTIFUL car. Not only was everyone friendly and honest, they also made my first experience buying a newer car wonderful. Not to mention working with me on the price! I definitely recommend them. Ask for William 😊< /review>

<Text>The vehicle I test drove had soda all over the console and windshield and floor mats. When the issue was brought to the salesperson he said that the homeless check the cars to see if they are unlocked and get into the cars. I know for a fact that the cars should all be locked and the cars are then unlocked by an associate only when a consumer shows interest. Therefore it just goes to show that this dealership does not care about their investments apparently. I do not recommend this dealership for your next car purchase. Bad service makes for bad business.<//Text>< pics>

<review>I have fraud on my credit which gave me a lower credit score. I was struggling to find a car and Loan. I even work for a dealership and it took them a week and half to get me approved. Well it’s to late I purchased my Ford Focus from integrity auto sales last week! I applied in the morning at work and by 1pm I had an approval. They kept in contact the whole time and answered all questions. With little down I got an amazing car and a great deal and package! Aaron and George worked wonders. I’m so happy with my experience at integrity. From the time I walked in at 630 pm I was out by 730pm paperwork signed and keys in hand! My next car will be purchased there. 100%. Thank you guys!</review>< Pics>

I am a first time buyer and I went after work just to pay on a car to hold it which you can do there. Enrique seen the need in my eyes and put me in a car better than I was expecting and I left the lot in the same day with the car. Their customer service has truly brought tears to my eyes and if you need a car here is the place to go trust me they will work with what you have.😁😁 Thanks again enrique you have changed my life in ways I don’t even think you can begin to understand. ❤️<//Review>

Paul, Enrique and Robert were so helpful in the process of buying my new car. They are excellent. I felt super comfortable buying from them because I knew I was getting a good price and I wasn't being pushed into a decision. They stayed after opening hours to accomodate us with our new vehicle. If you ever need a good car. Go to Integrity Autos and ask for Enrique!</Review>

<Review>This is my third car from Integrity. After my second time, I wasn't sure about going back to the company, but after receiving help from George, I'm glad I stayed. I only went in for some help figuring out my monthly payments, but ended up walking out with a new, better car for less than what I was paying previously! George was incredibly helpful, kind, courteous, and respectful. He really came through and created a positive experience. I'm happy with Integrity, and am a fan of George in particular.< /Review>< pictures>

Service was wonderful they really worked with me and my budget. My credit isn't the best but that was not a factor at all. They broke my down payment up into payments since I didn't have it all at the moment. Reduced the price that was asked online for the car and gave great advice on warranty plans. I would definitely do business here again !< /Text>

UPDATE: Once again Johnny Ballesteros at Integrity Auto has gone above and beyond for his customer! I needed to come in to have something repaired, but due to a busy schedule (I work two jobs) it was difficult to nail down a time. Johnny was kind enough to have a technician available for me when I was finally able to come in. He ensured that the service would be quick! And it was!!!!! I can’t thank Johnny enough for taking such good care of me! I really appreciate everything Johnny has done for me. And I’m sure you will get the same level of service! Once again, THANK YOU JOHNNY B!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I was not able to get the vehicle I originally went in for. But Johnny was able to find something that I liked and gave me a good deal. He has been very helpful throughout my whole buying experience. He’s very honest and not pushy. I’ll bring friends and family when the need arises for a quality used vehicle. Thank you very much Johnny! Keep up the good work!<//text>

Everyone was very accommodating. Made buying our car a pleasure. They gave a fair amount on the trade in. Also the vehicle was clean and in good condition. I would definitely recommend this dealership.< /review>

Omar showed himself to be an honest  professional understanding individual his customer service was everything anybody in my situation could ask for! I have nothing bad to say about my experience even if I didn’t  get to drive away I still felt like everyone showed me respect  not once did they mislead me to thinking I would get something I could not afford. Omar worked with my credit and my budget. He basically did the work for me and I have no complaints and that’s big coming from me 😅 I would suggest this place to all single moms or first time buyers<//review>< Resp>

Carlos the Salesman was the most amazing. He's super helpful. This place is cool. There is a wide selection. The process is explained in detail and they are very insistent. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.<//Text>

This was my first time doing business with Integrity Auto Sales. I have to say this was an AWESOME experience. I initially spoke with a representative named Paul , who was very helpful. I went in and was assisted by Enrique C.
He demonstrated nothing but professionalism!!
He walked me through everything explained everything in great detail. Enrique was great as was Paul</Review>

My vehicle had structural damage from a previous accident. Didn't know about it until I wanted to sell and ran a Carfax for the buyer. Now I'm taking a loss. Also, was promised fixes on the vehicle that they didn't follow through on. Just be careful before you buy from them!</text>< pics>

I came in with low credit and told the salesman exactly what I wanted. And less than 24 hours, both of us were able to find one that fit my needs, find a loan, and get me on my way. The vehicle needed some light detailing after getting it home, but it looks great! Can't wait to surprise my kids today!< /Review>

<Review>They should be reported to the BBB. They bait you to come in by posting fake pictures of vehicle on Facebook marketplace. You  Show up thinking the car of your dreams there at a decent price. Not only do they not have the vehicle....I don't think they ever even had that vehicle ever. They get you to come in, have you fill out a credit report and they will promise you they will not run your credit until you find a vehicle that you for sure you want to purchase. They state they will only do a soft pull which would not leave any mark on your credit report. But don't be fooled! If you don't end up purchasing a car from them they get you back by running a hard credit report which shows up on your credit report thus possibly lower your credit score and looking negative if you're trying to get a different kind of loan or purchase a car somewhere else. Not to mention they purchased their cars at an auction so be very weary of the condition as you never know what happened to that car and what needs to be fixed. It's in the auction for a reason right.</Review><date>1585826440705</date><user_id>108914783809353434924<//user_id>< response>

I came into integrity not knowing what to expect. With ok credit, and no down payment I was for sure I was running into a dead end. As I was walking the lot, George approached me with the warmest smile and immediately offered his assistance. I explained my situation and what I was looking for and he said none of that was a problem and that he was certain he could take care of me. We looked at a few different cars that I thought I wanted, and then George showed me a Honda I fell in love with and knew I needed. Within two hours I was driving off the lot with a basically brand new car at a WAY lower price than I had said I was willing to pay. George made sure the car had excellent mileage, no issues, payment was more than reasonable, and answered ALL of my questions so that I knew exactly what was going on every step of the way. I’ll never purchase anywhere else, and will definitely ensure that I’m handing his card out to all of my friends who are looking to buy!!! George, thank you for your time and patience today, it truly is appreciated.</review>

<text>Went here to look for a car I only had a 1400 down payment they stated I needed a co sign I got the co-signer and took them a day to get back from the bank when I got their the next day they were asking for all my information again they lost everything or they didn’t submit was in their for 5 hrs then called told me I needed 1700 down then when I go their changed it to 2000 very unprofessional and rude Enrique laughs like everything is funny and he didn’t come to help not once cause he knew what he did was in their arguing with me saying he knows what he said which he doesn’t. Don’t recommend going here their cars fall apart and they have to jump start their cars I seen him doing it to the one they were gonna give me don’t buy from integrity</text>< Pictures>

Nice men good customer service. I just didn't like that they never offered something to drink and just left us alone for over an hour. They need to learn how to make customers comfortable while waiting for approval.< /review>

<review>Lyric was very helpful and helped me get into a new car right away. He wasn't pushy at all and helped me finish the paperwork and the process smoothly. I go here whenever I need a car and they always work with my situation. My brother is even gonna get a car with them soon. A+ experience.

They left us hanging 45min at the desk waiting and then the manager came and was very rude, disrespectful with aggressive tone to just inform us that they can not help us anyhow... Why do you have to waste our time?</Text>

Truly horrible overall experience at the location in Sacramento on Florin! My strongest suggestion is find a car somewhere else!

My wife found a car via online search at this dealership. We went in together to look at the vehicle. Amed, who was the sales rep let us text drive the vehicle as the usual with the initial experience of any car dealership. Once we got back we negotiated. We said we were going think about it, they were pushy for the sale (typical like anywhere). Everything was seemed normal until the paperwork started.

As soon as the contracts were printed, Amed begins to multitask between us, another customer who was looking into a car, and apparently someone who he had already helped. Every question we had Amed could not answer himself. He knew nothing about the vehicle and he had to ask Reggie on several occasions about our contract. Reggie never sat down with us to explain it, he just yelled across the main floor from his desk.

Now this is were the experience took a turn for the worst. Reggie who is the floor manager, made several verbal promises that he did not deliver on or gave us the run around unnecessarily.

First, we had been assured that the car had been recently maintained which required a specific filter to be replaced ($350+ part/labor). Instead of replacing the filter, their service department just reset the "maintenance required" light and told us that everything had recently been looked at, maintained, and cleared. I guess they didn't expect us to take it to Toyota to pay for a vehicle inspection.

Second, their ad that they posted for public view online said that the car had GPS navigation installed and ready to use. When we drove off the lot, the SD Card with navigation was missing ($182 pricetag) and navigation was not working. After being instructed by a Toyota service technician that the dealership is responsible for the missing piece we informed Reggie at Integrity Autosales. He was reluctant to provide us one until my wife pulled their ad and explained what they were telling potential customers. At that point he put in a order for the SD card, it took about 2-3 weeks to receive it.

Third, Reggie promised both my wife and I without us bringing to his attention the matter of a second key FOB($500+) for the car. Now this is the main reason for me writing a review. Reggie promised my wife that they will send out the second key once the contracts are signed and approved. We have not recieved the key to this day. To make matters worse, when I questioned them about the key they said that it was shipped via mail with the SD card (which we received with no key FOB in it). The package that came was not tampered with and was in a paper thin UPS next day air envelope.

So I then follow up with them, I am put in touch with a Victoria since she is the person that was responsible for mailing out the key. She immediately gives me attitude when I ask questions regarding the tracking number, when it was sent, how much the package weighed, etc. She insists on calling me back to get answers... never does. I call back 40 minutes and she has left the building.

After I decide to visit the location in person and get more direct information. Reggie greets me improperly and answers any questions I have with short one word answers. When there is no progress with our conversation, he stares at me asking me "What are you going to do about it?" I become frustrated and spout off like a crazy person.

All I hope is that this review is read by at least one person we don't share similar stories. Too much time and effort was put into this.

Please stop supporting the location!

This dealership in Sacramento is by far the worst car buying and customer service experience my wife and I have ever been put through.

Just because they say they have integrity does mean they do... we were the naive. Don't make our mistake.< /Text>

I purchased my vehicle in October and before I could even make my first payment I experienced mechanical issues I contacted the dealer and brought my truck in for inspection. They said it would take 2-3days for the new part and they would call to schedule the repair. Well 2weeks passed I was never contacted so I called to get an update, I was told the part was not ordered, they apologized and said they would take care of it that day. I received a call saying it was ordered and was expected to arrive within 2 weeks and you guessed it! It has been several weeks with no update. I called this morning and was told they would update me once the mechanic was in. I have had this issue since October when the vehicle was purchased it is now January I will be contacting an attorney regarding California’s Lemon Law. I am so disappointed with their lack of concern or urgency for their customers. Please buy elsewhere!!!</text>

<Date>1591557126832<//Date><rate>2<//rate><review>Hello, here to express my experience from beginning to end.. Well I was directed to this dealership as a last option because I needed a new car quickly ( due to my old car Giving up on me)... I started by viewing the website and saved a few choices I wanted to view once I had the time to go into the dealership. Once there and got down to business( Credit, amount affordable for down payment & etc.) I showed a picture of a car I really was interested in but was told I couldn't get the car because they REQUIRE you to purchase a car under 10,000 very ODD- so I viewed my options again & found a car within what they were requiring but the dealership COULDN'T FIND THE CAR after they had already called and advised me to come in to view & test drive it - and this was an option they had listed on the website at the time too.. I was shown many rinky dink cars and out of all only 2 good options in which I chose 1... Fast forward to a month after having the car ( The Pandemic happened) and I was getting called almost everyday for more paperwork that I obviously handed in during the time of purchase but I was told its because they were still finalizing my loan.. WOW okay I did what needed to be done and turned in all of my paperwork all over again.

Fast forward to currently now in June 2020 my Tags and registration has not been provided to me because the dealership is still requesting the title from the owners ( Since March though it's been being requested) & NOT once was i notified about this I had to call myself b/c I new the temporary plates where due to expire && every time I reached out they like to use the excuse B/C OF THE COVID.. but that is just what it is an excuse b/c the dealership reached out to me during the COVID for more paperwork and I dropped it off in person ( during the COVID) .. They don't have to physically go pick up the title it could've been mailed or any other form since all companies are aware of the virus.. && I already figured they're behind with paperwork b/c the car I sold them back in MARCH with the title is still in my name collecting fees... oh and REALLY pay attention to whoever is dealing you a car they talk pretty quick and when you get to going over what was discussed make sure the pricing (DOWN PAYMENT) and whatever else is offered to you stays the same as what you discussed prio to signing paying any funds... PAY ATTENTION..

Overall with the expectations of the car its runs okay- the tire signal comes on every so often to fill up the tires with Air ( im not sure if i need new ones but yeah gets slightly irritating) The brakes were horribly squeaking in the beginning they did at least change then after going in there 2 times. Yes they still squeak but not as loud as before.

Im only leaving this review because I felt it was necessary and people do work VERY hard for there money and your time is valuable should never be treated any lesser than..

AND another funny thing is when my sister felt she should change this rating from 5 stars to 2 stars they called me the very next day 😄😄 but NEVER once reached out about my Registration and Tags.. we notice that the ratings matter but updates on documentation status doesn't..<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I was helped by Kurt Wilson. Very nice and honest salesperson from the start, made it so easy. Years of experience but mentioned it was his first day at this dealership, I am glab we got to help eachother. I bet he will do great at this
dealership. Totally recomend to speak to him if you are looking for a new vehicle.
He was straight to the point. He worked
around the numbers to get me at a
confortable loan payment.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Purchased a Harley-Davidson motorcycle that is in excellent condition with very low mileage as was advertised.

<Text>Went to meet a sales guy there and they wouldn't really respond to where he was after I requested him a few times. Just that they knew of him. I figured maybe the he went home. Turns out they just stole his sale because he texted me the next day. While we where there we where waiting for hours just to get the price. They told me how they could help build my credit if we got a loan so we did. They put my partner on every thing and told me just to go to the dmv later. Very unprofessional and inconsiderate. Don't go here to buy a car if you're buying one with another person. Be cautious and firm if you do decide to go buy yourself a car.< /Text><username>ADT< /username>< pictures>

A great used car dealer. Amazing selection of cars and their showroom is awesome. I am eyeing the Audi A8L they have...such an awesome car.

The sales reps were really great and are always there to help.

Check them out when shopping for your next car.< /review>

<text>My Aunt and I came to Intergrity to look for a car.  She was in desperate need due to her car no longer working.  We did not expect to leave with a car today.  However the salesman  Robert was very pleasant upon our arrival.  We told him directly what we were in need of and he assisted use with no hassle.  He made it so seamless that we left with a car my aunt fell in love with.  If you looking for good quality cars stop by and see Robert.  He’s the greatest!   God bless<//text>< Pictures>

l bought a van from here great service when buying a vehicle.. Not so great when problem solving.. It took almost a year just to receive my plates and tags.. Then when it came time to register my van.. My plates turned out to be invalid.. Then when I try to call or go in the person is either not there or they will not return a call.. Luckily I have family who work for DMV and they said they never released my paperwork.. Then I call the loan company and they don't even have the title! I will never lease a car again.. Worst company I've ever dealt with. Wasted $5000 for something I have to give up because I can't even drive it because of negligence on their behalf..<//Text>

It's hard these days to find a good used car dealer. We ended up at Integrity via Internet search. The vehicle we were looking at online had sold, but they let us know they had others in stock. The first one they showed us was it! We worked with them and they worked with us, ultimately I got a deal I felt good about. Thanks to Paul, Enrique and Bill for being friendly, courteous, and professional.<//review>

< Review>
If I could give this company 0 stars I would. Not only this company, but ALL of this owners companies. The lack of respect, ownership and customer service I have experienced is horrendous!

Let me take you to the beginning..
I received a Kia Soul Ev (or so I thought) back in March.When delivered to me two weeks after I completed my order, I was informed how I'm going to have to jump start the car because it won't turn on without it. Then I was informed how there is a SAFETY RECALL on my vehicle. That was extremely disheartening and I felt very unsafe. I had the car for two weeks and had to ship it to Palm Springs because it wouldn't turn on. Yes I'm in Las Vegas and I said Palm Springs. After I received the car, they mentioned how I have to send it there every time there is an issue.

Due to unforeseen circumstances (Covid 19) I was without my car until the middle of May. While my car was there, there was multiple other issues wrong with the car. Being I only had the car for two weeks, I didn't see why I would have to pay for this. This company denied paying until I wrote a review. "Give us 5 stars today and I will send you the check" fair enough.

Incident 2
now June, I receive my car and drive home. My car shuts completely off at a traffic light. You could probably understand how I feel unsafe in this car and do not want to drive this ever again. I take it to Kia immediately. I attempt to trade it in, and was informed of how much it was worth. That was impossible based off of my knowledge of the car's worth (kelly blue book, online, exc.)I take it to Toyota to see what they would offer. They stated that the reason I'm not getting what I think I should is because I WAS MISREPRESENTED. I was sold a" Kia Soul EV e wagon" but I had a Kia Soul base model stated by the VIN number. its a big difference because I'm paying for features this car doesn't have. You scammed me to make more money. I called you because I simply want you to buy back your car, I want to force a buy back but you won't return my calls or emails. Ive sent you certified mail, and no word. I got your attention last time through reviews so here I am. Make this wrong right< /Review>

< Review>
I am 77 years old and I have bought tons of cars in my lifetime but I can truly say that Integrity Auto Sales is undoubtedly the most professional and courteousdealership I have ever dealt with.  They got me financing at a very reasonable interest rate and affordable monthly car payment. They even arranged my car insurance for me. they undoubtedly are the best and you will gain everything by choosing them as your car dealership.< /Review>

Great experience with the sales team. Paul and Bill were especially helpful.They know their cars and the staff was very helpful and transparent all the way through with my car purchase.They only ran my credit one time and I got approved within minutes. If you're looking to buy a used car, I highly recommend you stop by Integrity Auto Sales first. This place may be the only place you'll ever need to go to buy your used car. They have a great selection as well. Only drawback is that they may be understaffed and sometimes they won't get back to you right away, so some patience is needed, but they'll get back to you.</Text>

<Text>I always hated the idea of having to go into a dealership again. The hassle, the time it takes, the negotiating... ugh!
But, I found INTEGRITY! Totally different experience! Super great and friendly salesmen! Experienced and honest guys! Bill (manager) and Robert Garcia made EVERYTHING super easy and fast and made the final price and payments fit into our expectations!!!
I’d recommend INTEGRITY anytime!!!!
Thanks guys,

< review>
I thought this was a good place but now I feel like we were ripped off. The Yukon we bought had a hole in the carpet that was covered by the plastic stick on dealer floor protector that we didn’t see until we took it off at home, it has a broken passenger sun visor and the driver side mirror was replaced with a cheap aftermarket mirror that doesn’t have the blind spot warning. Come to find out it was in a accident that wasn’t reported on the car fax report. Took it to a GMC dealership to get the recalls taken care of and they said there are signs that the Yukon was in an accident. We took it to integrity and they said it was never in an accident it just had a broken mirror that they replaced with a cheap aftermarket one. If it was never in an accident why did they have to fix the fender and mirror, right? Yeah they’re crooks. We asked if they could replace it with the correct mirror they said sure and kept the Yukon for 3 days and literally did nothing to it. It sat in one spot on the lot for 3 days.  We asked about the hole in the carpet and the sun visor. They were going to replace the visor and get us new floor mats to cover it but nothing. Never called us or returned any calls. We kept asking about it until they said “look we never promised you anything, you bought the car as is!”. Now if we tell the creditor that the Yukon was previously damaged and not worth what they said it was then the creditor will force them to buy it back and get us out of the contract but they took our car as a trade in so we will be SOL without a vehicle. We’re discussing with an attorney to see what options we have if any. We went here because our credit wasn’t good if you can avoid this place you should. I smell another Paul Blanco in the mist. Integrity is the next Paul Blanco.</review>

Our experience with Robert was great. We had and issue with our truck we bought the very next day, and we let Robert know and they took the truck back to fix it and things are going well. Great place to do business. The day we called about looking at the truck Robert stayed late and then worked a deal for us to come right in my area for what I could afford. Great experience. And we love our Truck. :-) Thank you Robert</review>

Very professional service at this dealership! I was interested in a Range Rover evoque, so me and my husband came to look at it.. When we came, the sales person was very polite, offered us coffee or water, was very professional... he showed us a car, we loved it, it was immaculate , so we went inside to work in numbers, but my monthly payment was a little over $300 and I can only afford up to $200, but they were very nice about it, so then they offered me a different car, BMW , we test drove that one and it turned out to be really nice and lovely car, the payment was still a little higher then $200, but I was very happy with it, because the general manager decided to give me a pretty good discount, so we end up buying it! My experience was amazing, they work very professional, quick, very focused on their customers and very polite! Will Recommend to all my friends and family!</review>

<text>I have 1 word to describe "Integrity" Auto: LIARS!!!  First of all, I was coerced by Paul to write my first 5 star review, with him practically breathing down my neck after the sale to ensure I gave them a 5 star review... and I thought everything was great! Boy was I wrong.

Then I get no registration tags in the mail. I call up the car lot numerous times to no avail. So then I get a voicemail left by Veronica that my tags are ready for pick up. So my husband and I come down on our day off.. Saturday to pick up the tags. Well they tell me the registration is closed! It would have been nice if Ms. Veronica had told me their office hours.

So Mr. Aaron the sales manager ensured me for the inconvenience of coming down from far that he would mail me my registration. So I wait and wait another week. Nothing.

So I call and speak to Ms. Veronica to see if the tags got sent in the mail. Low and behold she then tells me we OWE Integrity for my tags which when we bought the car in our unique situation I explained to Paul that I need to pay for the registration with our down payment now since we dont know what might happen.

So I asked to speak to the General Manager as this was not clearly stated to us nor did we get notice about additional fees, and Veronica said she would have a manager call me.

Now WEEKS have gone by and still no phone call. I want my registration tags or BBB reviews and Consumer Report will be my next stop.<//text>< Pictures>

Hands-down the best !!!   Every employee helped in their own special way, made me feel comfortable and excited !! I left in a 2016 Ford Fusion with less than 40 thousand miles 🕺🏽🚘 I recommend them  to all my fellow employees at work. If you are looking for a great Reliable car this place is the place to go !! 💯

Thank you all for the great experience  !!<//Review>

I bought my dream truck yesterday and we could not be happier with the amazing price, amazing help from Jerardo Aguilar. If you go here only ask for Jerardo. He is the man! Make sure you buy here and when you do it’s from Jerardo! My Chevy has gotten a bunch of compliments and we will make sure we send family and friends here to see Jerardo and purchase a car! They worked with me even though I had zero credit! Thanks guys we are happy!<//Text>

<Text>Originally bought a car from this place an had dealing with this place in September. The day I bought my car things where great as far as customer service was concern after initially having some problems in the beginning. After getting into a car an taking it home is when my troubles began the next day I was taking it to get a oil change an inspected ( never made it ) An my car stopped literally in the middle of the road. Fast forwarding I contacted them they suppose to had fixed the issue an I finally take my car to get inspected in which I find out it had some leaks coming from the transmission area an other then that the car was in good shape. ( they agreed to fix the leaks ). Dropped my car off a few times for the issue to be fixed ( an it never got fixed just a bunch of run around ). I then take for it’s due oil change to find out there was some kind of plumbing tape put on my oil pan screw to keep it in place. I tell them about this an they where suppose to fix it ( yet didn’t ) long story short I take my car to the maker to verify that they fixed the leak that I was told was going to get fixed an indeed they didn’t after putting dye in my car to identify where it’s coming from the leak. To make this short I ended up taking them to court because they didn’t fix what was said an I have messages to prove which was the leak an oil on replacement. I didn’t win because I didn’t purchase the contract warranty at the time of the sales the 48 hour one. I didn’t think I needed to as I was assured I’d be helped an they didn’t help. So I’m telling u guys just be 1000 % sure u want to do business with this place an make sure u purchase the extra warranty to have your car fully inspected by someone who isn’t them. I in the end am having to come out of pocket almost $3000 over to repair this leak they didn’t an replace this faulty oil pan they knew about.</Text><date>1554939594963<//date>< Response>

<Review>The name speaks for itself. Had the best experience ever at a car dealership. We got the car that we wanted thanks to Roberto G. He was very helpful, he also hooked us up with his agent for insurance. I would recommend anyone to go there and check them out. No pressure and they will work with you, good or bad credits. Thank you Roberto and the team at Integrity Auto Sales!< /Review></record>

<text>They do not honor their “30 day warranty” we’re stuck with a broken suv. They say they’re going to fix it, keep the vehicle all day then say the parts never came in or the parts were wrong or the parts were the wrong color. They did this to us four times already and we’re still stuck with a broke EXPENSIVE suv. Do yourself a favor and stay far far away from this place.< /text>< Pictures>

I’m very happy with my perchase! I bought my second car here, so Integrity got their lifetime customer!!! My first car was Toyota Avalon, but unfortunately it got totaled, so I was looking  for the same one, but they offered me even a better one with better interest rates, which was amazing!
Love the service!!!< /review>

It took a month to get an that's because  I called every day  up to 3 times a day. I will never buy anther car from them. NOTHING BUT LIES FROM THOSE GUYS.< /review>< rate>

<review>A couple of weeks ago after searching for a few months to buy a specific truck, I went in to Integrity Autoz to make an offer. After a short negotiation and approved financing, I purchased the vehicle. Very smooth transition with my sales rep Robert. Usually having an issue with a newly purchased vehicle would be bad, but in this case, I had an issue and the manager just requested I drop off the truck and they will take care of it. I havent picked it up yet, but if you are going to buy a used vehicle and maybe dont have perfect credit like me, Integrity Autoz is definately the place to shop. I will update after picking up my truck but so far this is a five star experiance.
Thank you Robert, Brandon and Rita ! ! and Kajeem.......didnt mean to forget the shop ! ! :)

<review>When I bought the car he said it was just serviced and would need nothing for 8000 Miles. Half way home I noticed my headlamp was out. He promised to send one but never did. Promised extra key fob that I never got. Ran hot in a few days so off to the mechanic I went. Many many codes showing. It had 6 leaks in cooling system and leaking oil. I took it back and now I’m looking at thousands of dollars in repairs. I am a girl alone and I believed him. I tried contacting him and others at dealership but nobody answered. Run from these shady guys!< /review>< pics>

<review>This dealer is one of the best. Why? They will work with u until u get what u wanted. They are very helpful  and they will make sure u test drive the car u wanted first.  My credit is not that good and i do have a car repo back in 2010. And i still get the car i wanted which is 2015 vw gti. The person who help me is Robert Garcia.

Robert was both professional and patient during my vehicle search. He assisted me in getting all of my must haves and really made me feel like the purchase was about being of service to me. I will be sure to refer both family and friends and the entire team for the most part was very welcoming and personable.</text>

<text>Edgar and paul were great in helping us find a car that fits our family. Selection of cars were a bit limited but it worked. Edgar was able to work with the manager and helped with the price to fit our budget which was super awesome.

I just wanted to share a quick note on what an excellent experience I had in working with Sales Consultant, Mike. He was incredibly professional in helping meet my needs for a new car. However, I was most impressed with how personable and caring Mike was during the whole process. I am delighted that I got to work with such a great individual!

Thank you for the positive buying experience and I look forward to telling my friends and family about how great Integrity Auto sales is and what a wonderful Sales consultant Mike is.<//Text>< pics>

My Husband went to Integrity Auto Sales in Sacramento and was very please. He was surprised that they took time to answered his question and appreciated the honesty. At the end of the day he was please with the vehicle he had picked out because it accommodates our family at a decent price. He would recommend you to go there and you will find what you are looking for.<//Text>

My cridit is not that good and i do have a car reoo back in 2010. And i still get the car i wanted which is 2015 vw gti. The person who help me is Robert Garcia. Trust me, he will work with u as long as u got stable job.

<Text>Enrique is one of the best helpers we've had, he helped us getting the SUV truck that we wanted, although at first we didn't meet the requirements for the truck and choose a different one he saw that I was unhappy with the Kia that I was going to end up getting so what he did was he kept trying to see if he can find a way for us to get the ford and out of no where he told me to follow him and told me that he got good news and talk to my family and I that I could get the truck that I loved. I recommend Enrique for anyone that goes to integrity he will help you and always be honest.< /Text><user>111077763859921906884< /user>< rating>

<review>- We recently went to Integrity Auto Sales looking for a family car, they have a wide variety of cars at reasonable prices and we were able to find just what we were looking for. The people there are really nice and treat you well and with respect, they let you look around without bothering you. They explain everything you may have questions about, which we appreciated a lot. The sales guys that were helping us with the process made us fell really comfortable and were really really nice with us. Being first time buyers with no credit we thought that it was going to be difficult to be able get accepted to buy a car at a good price, but we were actually impressed at how easy it was and at the price that we got our car. They understood our need and tried to accommodate everything they could to make it possible for us to get the car we wanted...     They even gave us gas money for our New Car !!! :)  I highly recommend this place.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
It's a typical car lot with commission based sales. The salesmen are nice enough. They have Spanish speaking salesmen from what I could tell as well as some who speak a Slavic language. It's being painted right now, so that's why the place looks shady and looks closed from the street. 3 stars because I had an ok experience. Not stellar, but also not terrible. Not sure if I would go back though.< /Review>

We let them do their job, but when we where told that “the vehicle was ready” it never was they still sent us towards the place the vehicle was at. Keep in mind the vehicle wasn’t ready but told us “it was ready” the tire place was closed, took us about a week or two to receive the vehicle back. I wouldn’t recommend buying from here they will tell you LIES, they are RUDE, I felt DISCRIMINATED. 👎🏻 It’s like the people that work here are not all their......... it’s sad<//Review>< pics>

Worst negotiating liars ever,  We made a deal for a SUV and they come back saying someone called and offered $4,000 more for the car so they would not be able to honor the deal but if we paid more on the downpayment we could have the car.  They knew we had limited resources and my kids really liked the car.  They played us like violins,  the car ended up having some minor issues that were supposed to be fixed but never received a phone call back after being ensured the problems would be fixed, poor business practice across the board. Will never go back...< /Text>

This site won't let me submit a review unless I put at least one star;
if I had the choice I'd put zero stars.  Integrity Auto Sales needs to change their name because they have NO integrity.  I won't go into detail, but Larry is a liar and not a man of his word.  Same with the people he works for.  I got nothing but the runaround and got strung along from them on a matter I had with them.  Do not trust them or use them ever.<//review>

<review>Worst dealer you'll ever do business with! I recommend everyone to take their business somewhere else. My girlfriend bought a car from them and the transmission went out 1 week later after going back and forward with them they refuse to fix it and gave us one option to do voluntary repossession and they would keep 2500 down payment we made we didn't want our credit to get ruin by these snicky rats so we took the option I still regard not talking them to court!!<//review>< Name>

Great people!! We had some issues with the first car we looked at. With no hassle, they put us in a loaner and fixed all the issues. And after all that, we decided we wanted another car and they did that for us as well. No hassle car dealership, first time I've enjoyed purchasing a vehicle. Worked with us thru every issue to make sure we were completely satisfied. Larry(Salesman), Brandon(Financing) and Vitali(Store Manager) were all exceptionally patient, understanding and compassionate. You have definitely earned our business.Thank you very much!!!</review>

On 05/12/2018 I went to Integrity Auto Sales in Sacramento, CA to purchase a vehicle for my fiance. I took the chance with the business based off the company having decent reviews and a professional impression by the salesperson. We went with a 2015 Ford Explorer that had minor cosmetic issues (window trim) and were told the disclosed "structure damage" I was signing was in regards to that and that I would be given a "Due Bill" to bring the car back in for the window trim to be glued back down. They gave me a Carfax showing a clean history with the only noted damage being the window trim. Not being educated that structure damage meant the actual frame of the vehicle, or having the real disclosure of what it meant, we went with the vehicle in trusting that this was the case. Shortly after my fiance lost her job and, in having to pay two cars on my own, I took it into Carmax in Sacramento, CA on 09/18/2018 to possibly get into a smaller vehicle with less monthly payments. Upon their inspection of the vehicle and in pulling a full vehicle history report, Carmax found that the auction disclosed on 01/2018 to the dealership that structural/frame damage had been noted with the vehicle. We have three children that the dealership was aware of and they still put my fiance and children in an unsafe vehicle willing knowing that they were trying to hide having to disclose the actual damage within the car. I contacted the dealership the same day I received the news from Carmax and the owner Vitaly told me to bring the car in and he would trade the car in at full car value for a different vehicle. I took his word and we went into try and speak with them about possibly returning the vehicle since it was a fraudulent sale at that point being that they never actually disclosed accident damage to the frame of the car. Upon trying to work out the trade, the owner tried to have my fiance and I take a loss of 5,000 dollars that would be added to one of a couple of cars he gave for us to look at. In the end he tried to charge 24,595 dollars for a 2013 Kia Optima valued at 13,000 dollars. I notified him that I would not be scammed into spending twice what another car was worth for us to get out of an illegal sale, which at this point he refused to do anything more. The initial salesperson we bought the car from even admitted, which I have documented, that he was unaware of the disclosed damage to the vehicle and that he would have never made the sale if he was aware of it being more than the disclosed window trim. At this point we have sought legal counsel, as frame damage/accident history is the only mandated disclosure to be made by dealers in California and this business willingly withheld this from us. I am posting this lengthy review so that all others that may be considering, or already have, purchasing a vehicle from the establishment are readily aware of the owner/manager's slimy practices. They will do everything in their power, even if it is not legal, to get you into a car, unsafe or not. They have no care whatsoever for their customers and only care about making a sale. You have been warned to not make the same mistake I did and find a legitimate business for your car buying purposes.</Review>

WARNING!!!! DO NOT BUY A FROM THIS DEALER. DISHONESTY, DECEPTION AND CORRUPTION!!! The sales person named Enrique Cervantes promise to get the missing parts without a problem but after signing on the ownership they will hide, after 15-20 phone calls, text & emails to speak with the manager either they are out, don't worry, or we will call you back, which they never did. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!< /Text>

By then we just weren't comfortable being in the car anymore so they switched us out into a nicer car with less miles. Mind you, my credit is not the best and they were still able to help me find a car that met my needs. they also had good advice about cheap car insurance which saved me about 300 bucks. Integrity (Larry, Brandon and Vitali) have bent over backwards to make sure that we are happy with our vehicle purchase.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Name>Kenneth Alvarado<//Name>< Review>
One of the worst dealerships I’ve ever dealt with. The reason I am writing this bad review is simply because of one phone call I made to them today (Friday). I submitted and online application on Monday night for a pickup and I got a phone call the next morning. A salesman named Paul told me that they needed me to go in person for them to run my credit, but I told them that I live in Fresno and before I drove up there I wanted to be approved. I asked if he could run it over the phone and he said yes but that he would call me later because they needed him to help out other people, so I said ok. He ended up not calling me back. Long story short, I kept calling all week trying to see if someone would help me get approved over the phone but no one helped me at all. Thursday night I talked with my family and agreed to take our business to another dealer, and I was going to call them to let them know why. Now, I was a bit annoyed that I was in communication with them for a week and they never ran my credit, but not enough to write a bad review. What happened today (Friday) is the reason for this. I called to let them know that I was backing out and that I didn’t want them to run my credit anymore. When I said that to the guy who answered me (I believe his name is Raul), he was extremely rude. He said “ok then why the hell are you calling to let us know that you’re backing out!?” I told him that I spent a week trying to get approved but no one did anything but before I finished my sentence he hung up. I called again and he answered saying that the phone was probably cut off. I told him that I was also backing out because I was already in contact with another dealer and that he was being rude and unprofessional by hanging up. He hung up on me again after saying that. So I called again to speak with the manager and luckily the sales manager answered. I told him what happened with Raul and everything else that happened that week and he was very apologetic. He said he would take care of Raul, but that they don’t run credit unless the person is present not over the phone. I told him that I wished they just would said that from the beginning instead of having to deal with this the whole week. He offered to give me a better deal for that pickup just because of what they put me through, but there is no way in hell im ever going to do business with them after this.< /Review>

Went in yesterday just too look at an Acura RDX. Then Roberto approached us in the lot and was calm, didn’t pressure us like most other sales people do. Needless to say, we ended up leaving with the RDX. Roberto was one of the most friendly and easy going sales person. He’s respectful and treated us with dignity which made us feel very comfortable.< /Text>

I bought a 2007 Saturn rely from here 24 hrs after i bought it i had to take it back they ended up having my car for 63 days. with in that time i had two cars as "loaners" one the transmission went out and the other was a 5 speed that had no air no heat and no radio. from there my van needed to have three engine put in from them. i got my car back the transmission started to go out. all in all i have sewed them for all the money i put out plus harassment from the employees there. this is a bad company.</review>

Don’t ever buy a car from this place I went in and talked with Robert Garcia and he made it seem like he was selling me the car I wanted little did I know it was a lemon. He did nothing but lie to me about the car after driving it for a little while I went to get my tires changed and alignment done at Les Schwab. They told me my car couldnt be aligned because the left strut was completely bent and needed to be replaced and have possible frame damage something they never told me . After taking it to them they fixed it but the vehicle still doesn’t drive the same . I took my car to a body shop where they told me I had a suspension problem and now the dealer is saying that there not willing to do anything about it because I should have noticed it sooner. Now all the paint on the left side of the vehicle is starting to chip . Never trust this dealer or any of the salesmen it’s just a scam<//review>

<review>Very friendly representatives. Unfortunately less than a month after purchasing my vehicle at Integrity it broke down because of a small error in a heater core bypass that caused fluid to leak all over the interior of the hood and engine. This fluid shorted out the starter and one thing led to another and I ended up paying almost a thousand dollars in repair costs. Afterwards I told Integrity Autos about the problems with the car. They took responsibility for unknowingly selling me a car with faulty parts and helped me take care of the problem with a compromise. Integrity Autos lives up to it's name because integrity is practiced by all of it's staff in the way that they conduct business and is seen in the vehicles that they sell.</review>< pics>

<Text>Wow, where do I  - start? I accidently entered the dealership because I had to use the restroom and was greeted by one of the staff men (no names). I told him that I worked in Davis and had to use the restroom then once I come out we can talk business. He said, "I hope you came to do more than use the restroom"! That day I purchased my car/suv from them. I have had minor problems, however, I can call them and explain the issue and they'll have me bring it in and fix it. Never once have a had a really bad moment with the staff. When they see me they know who I am and they know that I'm as honest as they have been to me. I have and will continue to refer people to them! As they continue to bless families with vehicles and smiles, I'll continue to be the best customer that they have.

After having the car for 3years, I wanted to trade it in and to my surprise, I was offered $400. The car was supposed to be salvaged due to a front end collision. They fixed it up very well and I was not able to even tell. They will never get another dime from me or anyone else that I associate with. I was SCAMMED! I should have took heed, when they had people protesting outside. Smh, I hate thieves.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

{'time': 1552599284230, 'text': 'Nickole, we are sorry to hear about your experience. The Cadillac you looked at has low miles, clean black leather interior and is very competitively priced. There are a few examples in the 50 mile radius that are a few thousand less but have almost twice the mileage. Once again, we appreciate all kinds of feedback but it is important to be accurate and fair otherwise it is a huge disservice to everyone who relies on reviews to make a purchasing decision.'}<//response>

I do not recommend that you buy cars or trucks in this dealer they sell broken cars I had a very bad experience in this place two and a half months ago I bought a truck and it turns out that the truck has many mechanical problems my truck has three weeks in the workshop and I have to pay $ 1372.62 for repair if you plan to buy cars in this dealer first take them to a workshop for a full inspection< /Text>
