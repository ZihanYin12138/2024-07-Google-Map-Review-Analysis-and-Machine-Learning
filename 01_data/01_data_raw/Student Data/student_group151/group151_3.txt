Cool shop, very nicely put together.  Great product and great service. They also have a drive thru, I've never even seen another shop do what they do here. They even have their own brand called "Froot" which I highly recommend, straight fire on both the gummies and the pre-rolls. Definitely check it out! 👍👍</Text>

BE AWARE OF FROUD. sadly I was a regular Cartridge buyer here and this time cashier insist for $80 while I was buying it there always for $70. even though label shows the same price as before. when i asked for reason, they kick me out very disrespectfully. Luckily I ended up buying the same product from down the street for $65. I Will tell all of my Persian and Jewish friends stop buying from you. will never go back</Text>

{'time': 1614134641115, 'text': 'Hi Callie, I am sorry you weren’t able to get a PlugPlay battery today from us. We can sell you the vape pods for the PlugPlay but not a stand alone battery. The law doesn’t allow any business  (dispensaries or vape shops or even 7-11) to sell vape batteries to anyone under 21. I would love to be able to sell batteries to 18-20 year olds but I can’t legally. I don’t know where you heard or read it was legal to, but it isn’t. We can sell you the vape pods, or even disposable vape battery pens, but legally we aren’t able to sell a stand alone battery to anyone under 21 years of age. The reason is that the same stand alone battery can be used for tobacco pods, which is illegal to anyone under 21 years of age. PlugPlay batteries can be used for tobacco pods. If you’d like to discuss it please email me your name and number to theplant2019@icloud.com and I would glad to talk with you about it.\nHere is a link to read about the law that changed 5/2016: https://www.wecard.org/new-“21”-minimum-age-law-takes-effect-california\nI do hope you will understand from a business owners perspective and hope you will come back again. Best, David'}<//Resp>

This place has a drive thru and a store!  They have everything you need and the customer service is the best around.  Everyone was so nice and helpful!!  I meet the owner and you can tell his vision has snowballed down to the staff and the feel of the business.  The product is hella fresh!!  I encourage everyone to go here at least once to try it out.</Text>

Customer service and selection was really good, however, the 25% off promotion for first time customers is horrible. They almost charge 30% in taxes   I spent $138, and $30 of it went towards taxes.  Three separate city and or state recreational taxes. Highway robbery. I won’t be returning as I can find other dispensaries that don’t charge so much in taxes.<//Review>

{'time': 1607922211029, 'text': 'Hi Sarah - thank you for taking the time to review my store. What exactly did you get that you were unhappy with? What cartridge brand was on sale?  We have promotions (bogo’s) from the brands we carry, I am unsure of what, if any cartridges we have a ‘sale’ on right now. We stand 110% behind anything we carry, if there is an issue we have no problem whatsoever no questions asked policy where we can refund and/or replace it. I have spent the last two years building a dispensary that is known for being reputable, customers first, customer service, trusting and honest. I look forward to hearing back from you. I am in the business of taking care of customers, and I would like to see how I can help make your experience at The Plant a better one. Thank you. If you’d rather call 818-855-2013 or email me at theplant2019@icloud.com. And please ask for David.  Best, David'}<//Response>

This place rocks!  The employees are the best!!  I’ve been to many dispensaries but this place is different and better! They won me over!! I kept going to atrium and I swear they just recommend whatever is promoted that day. This place they took time to ask me questions and helped me figure out exactly what I don’t like!  I feel educated since comin here! I’ve become alot more confident in picking my own goodies!< /Review>

Thank you for being open and making sure everyone has a mask on. The security guard was helpful and nice. So happy that you carry vegan gummies. The girl that helped me was so nice. I will be back.

This place has it all! Sparkling clean, easy to find, well lit, polite security guards, friendly and very knowledgeable budtenders, and an AMAZING selection! Many different kinds of edibles, lots of different strains, and tons of vape cartridges. I found the prices easily comparable to other local spots, and their edibles were particularly well priced. They even have a loyalty program. Definitely worth the stop!<//text>

My daughter recommended The Plant to me, I’m in a lot of pain from arthritis and they helped me get a balm called Mary’s and it’s wonderful. They explained to me how it works and why it works and I’m feeling a few years younger!<//text>

<review>The Plant has been my go to for a while now. Check in takes second and once inside, I get to shop!  Easily some of the best products around, and with covid19, they have sanitizers before you go inside, while inside, after lol and they give you hand wipes to take home to wipe down your products!!  An incredible staff, owners are always onsite so you know its run with care.  Thank you to all of you!  The Plant is my dispensary for life!</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

The owner is racist and always talking bad to staff every time I come here This place is a scam. They overcharged my card. Then when I caught them, they told me it was my banks fault. How could it be the banks fault when you guys are the ones who charged me and input the transaction wrong. Then after I talked to the “manager” he did absolutely nothing. They never gave me what they owed me. Then muscled me out with the security, when they knew they got caught stealing. Be careful using your card here, it’s a scam they overcharge and pocket the difference.< /review>

< Review>
You can use only debit card or credit cars with pin. But all transactions will be considered as ATM withdrawal. They charge fee 2.5$ for transaction and be ready that your bank will charge ATM withdrawal fee also. Of course, they’ll not tell you about that. Is it even legal?</Review>

<Response>{'time': 1567057844152, 'text': 'Hi Pashafedotov,\nI appreciate you taking the time. We publish on Weedmaps and in-store that there is a 2.50 cent ATM fee and that your bank may also charge a fee.\nAnd since we can’t actually charge it as a debit/credit card transaction, The banks won’t allow us, we can only do the next best thing, and what we thought was better than putting an ATM machine inside. Instead we have terminals at our checkout stations that act as a ‘cashless’ atm, no different than taking money out of an ATM that isn’t from your bank. They charge a 2.50 fee. Banks like to try and charge their own ‘non-bank atm fee. We find most banks do not “double-dip” and do not charge their own fee, but That is up to each individual bank. Not us. If we had a choice we would simply accept any form of payment without any fees.  It’s simply not up to us - the government wont let us. We strive to offer the best selection, quality, education, and experience. If you truly believe a 1-star review is warranted because we’re offering our customers a convenience instead of just cash and no other possibilities, then so be it. But if you can see our perspective and how much we wish we could take any credit card or debit card without any fees, and do away with any bank politics and just be treated like a retail store, you’d see why we’re trying to do what we can, for you. I work incredibly hard to make sure what I do, and every flower, every edible, every cbd product, every vape and concentrate in the shop are all 5-star, so you can experience only the best. I hope this helps explain it and perhaps you’ll see us as a 5-star store instead of 1.  Best, -Dave The Plant'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Very very disappointed in this establishment. The tax in this shop is 35 percent.it is extremely misleading when you purchase something you think is only $36.00 and the total actually comes to 50 dollars. It is upsurd. Very very misleading. Also, not to mention, my very first time in the shop my ear was bleeding from the amount of useless information about a particular pen to only come home and find out the pen doesn’t even work. I will continue to use SoCalop. Everyone should be careful because this store is one big scam.< /review>< gmap_id>

Brand new Whole Foods Market located in downtown Sunnyvale. Ample parking, short lines, never out of stock items, and friendly staff. Located in downtown Sunnyvale near Target, restaurants and bars, and El Camino Real.This store has many special features - lines are short and it's located in a great spot.

[The Features]
A full beer bar with seating, a sushi table, a deli, meat and seafood, produce department, and many grocery items including beer, wine, and spirits.

[Welcome Addition]
The parking here is one of the best parts. They have a dedicated parking lot just for the store. You can bring your carts to the lot and there is an escalator that brings the carts down.

The staff here is also great. They have many cash registers and the lines are managed well. We never have to wait more than a minute or two. This is one of our new favorite spots for going grocery shopping!<//text>

Staff are cordial and super responsive. Everything's well laid out, but it can still be difficult to find some things simply because there's so much of everything. Even if you're not interested in sweets, stop by the bakery and take a gander at the absolutely gorgeous custom cakes. Garage parking is handy.<//Review></record>

Very neat, clever usage of fridge space, like the shelves for small items like spices and chocolates, the chilled drinks are all placed in one section unlike Los Altos, appreciate the team member picks, lots of hot food options and fancy cakes. Unfortunately they don't have ground chicken other than prepackaged.
As someone else mentioned, there were no recycle or compost bins and had to give my personal details to sit down outside. It was apparently for COVID related policy.<//review>

The best organic food in my area 😇.
I put 3 stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ because this store has only around 60%-70% of the regular whole foods products/offerings. Also, the new coffee bar is not open 👎🏻, for unknown reasons, presumably related to covid but the employees don’t even know why. That's ok, I can give my coffee business elsewhere.< /text>

Beautiful and pristine store, but the customer service is terrible!
The store was rather slow, so two salespersons were chit-chatting while one rang me up. Didn't give me the time of day, just handed me my change and kept on talking. On another shopping visit, salesperson very rude, reluctant to show me where to find a product.
So sad...
Much rather go to Redwood City Whole Foods. At least they're friendly there!<//Text>

<Text>It's very clean and organized in the store, but I found it a bit too bright for my liking. I know it's a pandemic but I found it sort of annoying that a bunch of the "doors" are blocked off and unusable, so everyone has to go in and out through one door. They didn't have any individual slices of the cake I wanted, so I had to buy a whole cake.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Lots of parking places with some spots reserved for EVs (charging via ChargePoint).
The store stack fresh fruits and vegetables along with a range of other groceries. Staff is polite and helpful.
Carts are sanitized by the staff. The store requires face coverings at the moment.< /review>< pictures>

This is a new location for Whole Foods and they did an awesome job making it. It's one of the larger format stores with a great selection and ample parking. It's well maintained and is also close to Target so one run gets a lot of stuff done.</Text>

<Review>I love how fully stocked this store is! Not sure if it’s because it’s new, but I was able to get everything I wanted (and more)! I also like how everything is well organized and spacious compared to some of the other stores. I also feel like there is more selection here.<//Review><userid>111992389054053420039<//userid>< rating>

Much anticipated opening. The store is enormous with a great selection of produce, and we spent quite some time exploring around. Everything is clean and organized. Parking is easy with a huge parking garage nearby. Staff is friendly and helpful. Overall, a great experience.<//Text>

While the snarky customer was cussing without filter, the cashier said and did nothing to make things right and salted the wound by nodding and smiling at the rude customer.

Will never shop here again and telling my friends this isn’t the place for decent human treatment.

Every section is fully stocked with a large variety of products. There is also more than enough parking for this location.</review>< Name>

It was an adventure exploring the enormous store! I was most excited about their huge selection of beers, wines, cheeses, produce, seafood, and meat.

They have a huge beer selection, full of local brews and mainly full of IPAs and Stouts, for the most part (not complaining because that's mainly what I drink). Would have loved more organization of what is from where and what kind of beer they are.

I had to ask for help finding things, especially since the store is so new and so large, and I didn't know my way around just yet. The employees were super friendly and helpful though. I was asked if I needed help many times when I didn't and when I did they showed and guided me to what's on sale and what's a good deal, not just the priciest item on the shelf.

Recommendations: Park in the parking structure and enter from there if you're grocery shopping, park across the street in the Macy's lot of you're going for Floodcraft Brews (beer, food, coffee) or Whole Food's cooked to order section, which includes rice bowls, soups, sandwiches, sushi, and charcuterie too (though the cheese is opposite the meats on the other side of the store, fyi, by the wines and beers).

Also, bring hand sanitizer, many packages in house products had the labels on the bottom requiring picking them up, handling them, and checking the label to see what it is or what's in it. In COVID times, this makes me cringe, but, it looks nicer, I get that...

Glad this was finished and is so close to downtown Sunnyvale. Excited to learn its secrets, best foods, and enjoy this newly minted cornucopia.</review>< pics>

New store (2020-Nov), it FINALLY opened.  Has just about what you need. Not as large as some nearby stores, but maybe their stock will shift with time. I parked a block away and hiked in, which might not be great if you have a hulking cart.

Close to a dozen other places and the Farmers Market, which is great for a combined multi store trip.  This store will save me half an hour a week from going to a different store.< /Text>

<review>When Amazon cancelled my Christmas Eve order last minute, Sean here at The store saved my Christmas Eve by personally taking me aisle to aisle to pick the items for me right before store closed.

<Text>Stick to safeway if you want better quality and taste at competitive prices. A lot of items taste bland as compared to safeway. Stuff like fruits and sandwiches, salads, wraps at food counters are of lower quality and missing flavor than what you may get at safeway. Overall shopping experience is great and they also have good selection of beer but for the price you pay, you would think they would offer food with better quality. Raw Meats and seafood    is fresh and great quality.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Terribly small selection of items.  Could not find several items they normally carry. And then to top it off, thier carts lock up when you try to go to your car. I might expect that in large urban centers, but not Sunnyvale. It's rated one of the safest places in the US.  Ofcourse no sign alerts you to this when you walk in and grab a cart. You are left to figure things out on the way out. No customer service, no help. What a rip off. Avoid the place.</Text>< username>

This could be the best Whole Foods in the area, it's new, big and beautiful, but they lack people a lot. If you want to buy meat - prepare to wait a lot of time since there is always only one person there and packed meat is not always refilled in time, the same happens if you want freshly cut ham.< /text>

I was asked to leave the outside table because I was uncomfortable to provide my phone number in their weird “guest list” (something to monitor the spread of COVID. And I didn’t have any symptoms, also I had not been in contact with anyone diagnosed with the virus). While I’m always respectful and understanding of COVID related regulations, this particular one doesn’t make any sense. There are tens of people who come and stay inside the shop who are not asked to share their personal details, why do I suddenly have to do it as soon as I sit down on an outside (!) table?<//text>

This weekend, one of the cashiers who helped us was only half - heartedly wiping down the grocery items between customers, leaving me quite concerned who invested are they in customer safety during Corona times.

Other than that, it is like a regular whole foods store with similar selection and layout.</review>< UserId.>

It’s clean, bright and well-organized. I need to try the boxed sushi next time; I saw that it was $14 for the nigiri I was eyeing. There’s also some fresh hot items like pizza, rice bowls, noodles, and more. I love that they feature so many local purveyors too (bakeries, to-go items from restaurants, etc).

There were quite a few Prime deals posted, so don’t forget to scan your barcode or enter your phone number at the register when shopping to get the discount!<//Review>< pictures>

The clerk at the entrance carried our luggage to the car.  While saying that today is the first day.  Whole Foods with great people!</Review>

<rate>2</rate><text>Beautiful store and staff is super nice. But ordered two identical veggie sandwiches with ALL veggies plus avocado and was charged for their Tempeh Bacon and Avocado sandwich ($9) and hardly any vegetables. Just barely a smarter of arugula, avocado, tomato and onions. No pickles, no Cucumbers, no romaine, no olives, no spinach. A $9 dollar sandwich with virtually nothing on it. Normally I’m charged $7 at other Whole Foods because it’s literally bread plus veggies. The clerk fixed this for me but I basically ate a thick Cibata bun with barely a thing in between. Was very disappointed (and still hungry! Highly considering eating the second sandwich that I bought for tomorrow’s lunch but it’s too much bread, lol). Otherwise, loved the store for aesthetics and selection. I think I’ll still be going to the Whole Foods in El Camino Real for my sandwiches in the future. If anything else, their selection is a lot bigger. I bought about $65 worth of sake and Soju. They’ve got some great stuff!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Poor customer service. I was followed around the store, given dirty looks, staff was unhelpful, and the selection is terrible. The worst part was when the caddy for my shopping cart catapulted my groceries onto the floor. For a new store this is a disaster.</Text>

<text>I came here for a battery change and the service was amazing especially if you have Oliver and I recommend you asking for him because I’m not one to know a lot about cars and he was kind enough to be patient and help me with what I need. Was fast and quick and was straight to the point. I would definitely come again!!😁< /text>< Resp>

< Review>
Want to compliment the Lake Forest location for their outstanding customer service.

Having replaced a car battery in 2020, it just stopped charging and could not hold a charge.

Having a mechanic check the alternator and passing that test, I drove to the local store and they not only replaced the battery, but also wLked outside and replaced it.

They gained a customer for life. GREAT customer service.  Wish all companies acted that way!!<//Review>

Usualy this is my go to place for autoparts and some bike parts. Friemdly people, good prices, conveniently located. I was not aware that they sold some motorcycle parts as well. Just recently I was in need of a brake line and looked it up, they popped up on places that cary it. I have a 2012 Harley and they carry several parts for mine. Plus I get my headlights from here which are way cheaper than getting them at the Harley shop.</Review>

On May 20th 2020, I visited O’Reilly Auto Parts in Lake forest to purchase Engine Oil with the sole purpose of receiving a rebate which I saw was marketed online. Being a relatively new customer to O’Reilly, I have never purchased an Item with a rebate and was not familiar with the process.  The cashier that help assist me with my purchases was Justin, and not once did he inform me on the necessary steps to receive the rebate, all he said was that “it would come in the mail”.

Fast forward to July 10th 2020. I walk in to O’Reilly parts to purchase a new cabin air filter and inquire about not receiving my rebate for the purchase I made 2 months ago. The cashier told me that I had to submit a form in order to receive it and was sorry that the original cashier never told me to submit the necessary form. I asked to speak to the manager to see if there was anything they could do. Nick, the manager walked out and insured me that the promotion was still valid and that I could still submit my paperwork. When I get home, I notice that the form says that Nick and the cashier gave me said explicitly that the purchase must be from May 27th – June 23rd, which I then realized it was for the following month’s promotion, which did not apply.  Were they too lazy to check my receipt to cross check what they were explaining to me? Or did they take the easy method of just giving me a form to fill out in order to get me out of the store?

Driving back to the store again, I asked to speak with the manager Nick. I could see the cashier walk to the back of the store and address the manager (Nick) from where I was standing. I could clearly see Nick briefly talking to the cashier, brushing it off and not take the time to address it and then proceeded to walk out of the store. The cashier returned to me and explains that they “there’s nothing that they can do” and that Nick, the manager has left for the day.

From a Customer’s perspective, I find it extremely disheartening that a manager of a store would not only take the time to make sure they are giving me the right information of an application to fill out for a different promotion, but decides to not take the time to make sure their customers are addressed properly when they are facing a problem that they initially created when they did not tell me to submit an application for a rebate.

Please do not shop here, they do not value their customers time and will not bother to make sure their customers have all their questions answered. Worst customer service from a manager I have ever experienced.< /Text>

These guys are the best. Super easy to work with and knowledgeable.
I got the wrong size air filter and the exchange process was a breeze.
The two different employees I talked with casually were friendly and easy to get along with.

This is one of my favorite O'Rilley's in the area.<//Review>

The people are nice, but for the third time they told their used oil tank was full and last time they told me to take it to the oil change place next door. I don't believe their tank is full; they just don't want to deal with used oil because they can just direct people next door. I'm assuming it also saves them money because they never have to recycle their oil tank.<//Review>

Did not find the part (front wheel hub bolt).  The assistance was great, the employee looked for the part several differwnt ways and I appreciated his efforts.  He also gave me some recommendations on where else I could try.< /Text>

<text>Been shopping here for a while, never had an experience that stood out til now. Went in to buy a part and found out they were out of stock of. So they ordered me in what I needed and said to come in the next day to pick it up, so I did and they couldn't find it after having to wait 30mins and they finally told me theyd reorder it and I could come in later that week to pick it up, same thing happened and now I'm waiting for another 4 days for the part to come in to hopefully be able to pick it up and not have them lose another one.
My vehicles not running right now for about 2 weeks as I have to wait for this so it's a real damper.</text>< gmap_id>

I went in 30 minutes after they opened and had to wait about 10 minutes before I was helped. There was only 1 worker there with 1 customer at the counter and 1 in front of me. I bought wiper blades, 1 had to be ordered and would be there a few hours later.

I asked for the blades to be put on, since the website said this was offered. The worker looked put out by my request and I was told I had to wait for another worker to arrive which was about 5 minutes.

I went back 3 hours later for the other blade and had to wait in line for another 5 minutes or so to be helped. Then when I asked for it to be put on I had to wait for another worker since there was a long line. 2 minutes later I got helped. Unfortunately he didn't know how to replace the blade so he had to get someone else to do it.

Spending a total of about 20 minutes just standing around waiting to be helped was a bit ridiculous. Doubt I'll be back.</Review>

<review>Great staff and your average selection of off the shelf auto parts for most major makes and models.

If you've got a question or are unsure where to find something, asking a staff member always helps, as opposed to aimlessly wandering the aisles.

Minor criticism would be the air filter selection. Brands were limited, and the shelves didn't appear to be stocked in a consistent order (e.g. they appeared to be stocked by part number, but probably only 70% of the time).  Also returned parts appeared back on the shelves without any sort of inspection from the store. E.g. I found a used oil plug crush ring inserted into a returned pack of 4 crush rings. This should have been an easy thing to spot during the return; as easy as it was for me to spot while shopping.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Went to get windshield wipers. Everyone there asked me if I needed help. One kind older gentleman looked up my car and found the kind I needed.  Another employee named Julian assisted me putting them on. He was so kind and the old ones were so difficult to remove. If he didn't install them for me I would have had such a hard time. Who knows what would have happen.</review>

Not busy at all, easy to get in and out quick with staff around to answer questions. Products organized reasonably well too, didn't need any help finding anything. Tons of parking nearby to boot, so it's a very easy-to-access location.<//Review>

<Review>The guys at O'Reilly really helpf. The oil drain plug on my 2007 Ford Edge was put on by King Kong at the dealership. After hours of trying to get it off myself and stripping it down to a round Bolt, the guys at O'Reilly let me try every tool possible to get it off. After being unsuccessful with every tool they had, they walked me over to the Valvoline oil change place next door and they got it off at no charge. Needless to say without the O'Reilly guys help I would probably had to of had to pay a welder to take the drain plug off at a crazy price. Thanks guys, you got a loyal customer now.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dce9e0f7e5aa7b:0xa49258683b89465d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dave, the manager is very sharp and helpful.  Kaitlen also knows here stuff. However, their are logistic issues that become a customers problem when parts don't arrive on time even after you witnessed the counter person make the order.  I lost a sale of a car because the counter person made an assumption instead of making certain a specific part would arrive for me in time to make the car sale.  The counter person was a man about it and admitted he made a mistake which I did appreciate. However basic engine questions are an enigma to some of the  newbees and young counter staff. Some have good critical thinking skills and some I would not trust to walk my dog.  Entry level positions..I think I expect too much. What can I say.<//Text>

I want to love Seaside. It has everything I love, mouth watering burritos, one of the best Monte Cristos you've ever had, and glorious thick cut bacon. And this place gives you the biggest portions, so bring your doggy bag and or your appetite.

The one thing to note about this place is there is usually going to be a wait. This is due to the size of the restaurant (90% is outside seating) and that it's a popular place. This alone prevents me from coming here more often, unless I got 3-4 hours to kill.

The reason why I didn't give this a higher rating is the times I do come here, something is always wrong with my order. Normally, if my order is wrong, I'd be more than happy to tell someone but since it takes so long to get my food in the first place, it would probably take another 20 minutes before I'd get it back. And I would feel bad about asking (I know I'm weird). So instead of being a pain for them. I just avoid coming here. But by all means, you should give this place a try, it's definitely a local favorite.< /review>

<Review>Took my pregnant wife here for Mother’s Day this year...she (and I) absolutely loves it. The wait was close to an hour due to the day it was, and it seemed the staff were a little overwhelmed, but the food was amazing. And the servings are absolutely huge. Will definitely return the next time we’re in town.<//Review>< pics>

We were looking for a quick breakfast to go.  So glad we sat down and enjoyed an awesome breakfast.  The owner Tim suggested the home made English muffin with eggs, which was amazing, the French toast and fresh fruit... double amazing​ and the shell burrito was delish!  Atmosphere was lovely, cute seating inside on a rainy day.  Highly recommend this place!< /Text>

Updating my review after remodel: even more indoor seating with tons of outlets and big TVs. The food is sublime! Everything is delicious but come hungry because portions are generous! Anything with potatoes or bacon is a must order! Just go already.</Text>

Charming place. While the food is always amazing, it's not always consistent. It depends on what ingredients they can find. They, therefore, get creative with the ingredients.< /text>

Not only does this place have ridiculous hours (they close at 4 but the kitchen closes at 3?!), the staff only grudgingly greets customers (as if customers are a distraction from their work) and the one food item I did finally get to try (a Mexican casserole) was dripping with grease. Needless to say, I won't be back.< /text>

Food takes way too long, it's overpriced and inconsistent. The customer service is poor.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Really great breakfast, large portions in great quality. Even the cappuccino was excellent. The whole family was very satisfied, everything from sweet to savory was satisfied. The reference to unsupervised children was a hit, friendly, clear, in no way child-hostile and humorous.

(Original)
Echt super Frühstück, große Portionen in super Qualität. Sogar der Cappuccino war hervorragend. Die ganze Familie war hoch zufrieden, von süß bis herzhafte wurde alles bestens befriedigt. Der Hinweis auf unbeaufsichtigte Kinder war der Hit, freundlich, deutlich, keinesfalls kinderfeindlich und humorvoll.< /Text>

The staff was excellent and so much fun. The very nice lady that assisted us was very knowledgeable about the products that they offered, and her recommendations were spot on. We decided that we were going to go back for another visit on our next vacation.< /Review>

OMG! Like a kid in a candy shop...I think I embarrassed my husband, lol. We drove past a couple times as the entrance is set back a little on the deck. The staff was great with information shared and selection was superb. Found what I had been looking for, for years!! Shocked, excited and happy with our purchase, even though its on the higher-end price wise. If its something you love, it makes you happy and life is easier to manage because of its medicinal benefits....the small cost increase is not only okay but acceptable because no one else has it!< /Review>

Sol de Mendocino is the highest quality marijuana dispensary on the Mendocino Coast. Their staff is very knowledgeable and kind. If you are looking for quality medicine provided by real humans who care I highly recommend this shop.< /text>

<review>Helpful very knowledgeable staff. My favorite among the 4 or 5 shops in the area. In my recent visit 3 days ago, they had a table set outside where you can peruse their products. They have curbside pickup for online orders. Or you can call them if you need assistance with your orders.<//review><Name>Rachel V</Name>< Pictures>

The ladies were super nice & helpful. Pointed me to some local bud I'm excited to try! Very cool, low-key shop. *Tried the product... smoothest I've ever had. Thank you!!<//Review>

The staff was unfamiliar with their own products and was not familiar with the strains... There was two different workers there and neither of them were knowledgeable about CBD or strains for pain it was quite shocking being this was in Mendocino County...<//Review>

<text>On weed maps it states if you place a review they will give you a free gram. I was on vacation in the area&did so. When i asked the budtender"rob" to claim the gram he did not honor the weed maps review&claimed it wasn't in system. When i pulled it up on my phone&showed him he still refused to honor it?that's what i call false advertising!!! Went next door to the leonard moore dispensary&had an awesum experience. -5stars for this place!!!< /text><gmap_id>0x80804d34e360d257:0xc265881eeb81e4b2</gmap_id><Name>Taylor Weik</Name><Date>1455945810973</Date></record></dataset><record>

<review>Brian Hayter, Vet at Aliso Beach Animal Clinic totally rescued us. We were trying to leave on a vacation and our dog was having huge bowel issues. Mind you, our dog is over 16 years old, blind and deaf. He's a cute little thing, but this concerned us greatly. And we were in desperate need to get him to a vet. We called before hours to Brian's office and he was there and he told us to come right in gave us the appropriate medicine and within less than 24 hours our sweet pup was 100% back to normal... He is a terrific vet. We've worked with him a few other times and he always gives us great suggestions, provides good quality information, and doesn't put us through a big rigmarole of testing unnecessarily. We are grateful to him and his team.</review>< Pics>

<Review>We moved to Dana Point, CA in November 2018. A friend referred us to Dr. George and when I called to set up a time to meet our poodle, Norman, Dr George invited us to come that same afternoon. Her staff and she are true professionals and compassionate caregivers. Dr George takes the time to explain current health issues,  treatments and always follow up, as well as, always taking a good look at your pet each time they are in for an appointment. We highly recommend Aliso Beach Animal Clinic.< /Review>< resp>

<review>I have been bringing my dog and my cat to Aliso Beach Animal Clinic for three years now. I like how friendly, caring, professional and helpful they are.

<review>I have always considered Aliso Beach Animal Clinic my first choice in care for my beloved dogs.  Many vets are much closer to where I live, but I would not feel as comfortable as I do with Dr. George and her staff.
Very caring, very knowledgeable and all round GREAT</review>< time>

<Review>I am so grateful for this place. I previously went to a different vet who didn't seem to do a thorough exam on my dog who had something clearly bothering her. When I came here it was very obvious they really cared and listened to me. After a quick exam and X-rays they finally had idea what was going on with my girl and I felt confident that she would be ok when we left. She's already back to herself and I'm so grateful I chose to come here for a second opinion. It's really frightening to trust somewhere new with your fur baby but I can honestly say they have my full confidence and this will be the only place I go now.< /Review>< Pictures>

So very caring. I started with my new kitty and his first visit to Aliso Beach Animal Clinic on exactly one year to the day that I took my old cat in at the end of his 20 year life.  I trust Everyone in this shop with the best loving care they can give my furry family members.<//review>

Dr. Caroline George has taken care of our pooches for going on 6 years. She and her staff have always displayed competence and compassion as well as  prompt attention and availability.  Sadly our most recent encounter was to euthanize our very elderly and disabled pet which was handled with patient and reassuring kindness and relieved her of her suffering peacefully and humanely.</review>

Dr. George is warm and compassionate and has had to see me for routine visits and through some sad times as well.  She always listens to the pet owner and  always has great options instead of just pushing you to the highest cost treatment.

Both Dr. George and Dr. Church are skilled and compassionate veterinarians. We have been impressed with their personal and their medical concern for our dog, Gilly, who has had some serious medical situations occur.  They always return our calls promptly and answer all of our questions with patience and knowledge.  We rest better at night knowing that these wonderful doctors are available to us when we are faced with Gilly's situation.  Our gratitude goes out to both of them!< /text>

<Text>I started coming to the Aliso Beach Animal Clinic five years ago when I lived closer to Laguna Beach.  Dr. Davis and her staff took wonderful care of my dog Bailey.  I moved about 30 minutes away after a year, and I continue to take Bailey here.  Dr. George is the new owner of the animal clinic, and she and her staff continue to take such loving care of my dog, which I appreciate so much.  Dr. George is very kind, compassionate and takes time to talk to me about my concerns when I bring Bailey in, and she calls me to check up on him.  I always feel that my dog is in such good hands each time Dr. George or any of the other vets takes care of Bailey.<//Text>< user_name>

<Review>Since 2005, Aliso Beach Animal Clinic has cared for my family. From my cat, that died of cancer, to my little rescue dog that was euthanized suffering from a lung tumor and other ongoing issues with multiple dogs. The staff are very involved in our family. I can always count on Drs George and Church to provide compassionate, reasonably priced services. The extra love and technical expertise have kept us coming back. Even after moving out of the area. I still commute to get the level of care that I need for my babies.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I have been bringing our dogs here for YEARS. The care and treatment that they have received has been the best. I have never had a complaint or a concern. Dr. George has recently taken over from  Dr. Davis. Dr. George has picked up right where Dr. Davis left off. Not only has the care given to our best friends been perfect the care given to us when we loose one has been very kind. Fear not. You can trust this pet medical group. The staff has always been kind, friendly and caring.</review>

We have always loved going to Aliso Beach Animal Clinic and SKIPPER feels pretty good about it too!!  We know that our precious possession will be well-treated and professionally cared for.  The transition of owners and vets went very smoothly, thankfully.  The "Skipmeister" will be turning 15 in June and he still wants to play!!  We leave thinking Dr. George and the entire staff love him as much as we do....< /Text>

I've been bringing my kitties to Aliso Beach Animal Clinic for 16 years.  The expert care and compassion have meant everything to me.  My rescue kitties have always needed extra care and presented special health problems to challenge the doctors and staff alike!

< Review>
This is truly the best group of veterinarians to be found.  They take every extra step to ensure your baby is ok before they leave the office.  They follow up.  They care.  They won't let you down.

Revised in November 2018... 2 years later and I say these doctors are still the most compassionate, caring, and knowledgeable.  I took my dog in today for a vaccination and Dr. George looked at her records for any allergies or reactions in the past.  They go above and beyond.  I wouldn’t go anywhere else!</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>We love Aliso Beach Animal Clinic! Dr. George and her staff are so knowledgeable and caring. I always knew our yorkie Buster was in the right hands if there were ever any issues. Most importantly, she and her staff were so compassionate and kind when my Buster passed away last year at 13 years old peacefully in his sleep. Dr. George had followed his tracheal condition and had it managed with lots of knowledge and care. It is never easy to lose a loved one but we know exactly where to go when we get a new fur family member.<//Text>< pics>

We have been going here for years.  We were a little worried about the new vets.  However, we love them!  They are compassionate, patient and caring.  Dr. Church looked at our dog after an emergency and helped us all out.  He removed an unnecessary and uncomfortable nose tube in Anna (our poodle), then created a diet to keep her on track with avoiding further problems.  We feel very safe with bringing our pets here.  Try them!

Dr. George and her staff are very sweet with my super nervous dog. Even let us wait in the car and called us in when they were ready for us. 1/2 price immunizations on Tuesdays! No appointments necessary.< /text>

I have been taking my pets to Dr. George for over 10 years and i drive from Corona to see Dr. George. Dr. George has an excellant bedside manner with my rather difficult chihuahua. My dog is my child and I trust Dr. George implicitly to manage her care. T he staff at Aliso Beach Animal Clinic are friendly and helpful. I highly recommend Aliso Beach Animal Clinic.</Review>

Compassionate people and true professionals. Dr. Church is an exceptional surgeon. He operated on my cat's shattered leg and even boarded him in their own home for a few nights post-surgery just to make sure he was okay. Thanks do the careful attention and post-op care instructions given by Dr. Church and Dr. George, my cat's leg has fully recovered. He climbs his cat tower and runs around like the traumatic experience never even happened. I strongly recommend Aliso Beach Animal Clinic to any pet owner, especially if you have an injured pet.<//Text>

<Review>Dr.George and her staff are very patient and handle my older dog with the utmost care.  His bad back makes him anxious that he will be hurt so it takes empathy and understanding to get him calmed down so he can get the basics like nail trims done.  I appreciate the extra work it takes and always trust this clinic to do right by him.  Highly recommend Aliso Beach.

Walked in last week with my Chessie under the weather.  Saw Dr. George within 10 minutes and was out the door in 45 minutes after blood work and with 2 scripts.  He is now doing fine and Dr. George has called twice to check in on him.  Would not trust anyone else with his care.  Thanks!<//Review>

<date>1618988758116<//date><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>my adult kid and i have several piercing done by Gage. his exuberant personality and nearly painless piercing make him a joy to work with. he’s amazing at curating a well proportioned ear party. he takes great pride in his craft and it shows in his flawless execution. he is extremely knowledgable in body piercing and his jewelry options.  we drive a great distance to use this business and won’t go anywhere else. the new piercing space downstairs is beautiful, with the same upscale vibe as the upstairs(tattoo). so clean and inviting. really cool touches everywhere you look. very well made, beautiful options for jewelry. while they offer affordable pieces, nothing is garbage. if you’re looking for a cheap piercing, this is not your store. they only offer high quality metal, which is best for healing.
highly, highly recommend.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Largest gold jewelry selection that I have ever seen!
They specifically only carry 14 and 18k solid golds which is great for sensitive skins.
It wasn't the cheapest place, but who really wants "cheapest" when it comes to piercing jewelry that goes inside the body?
I love their lifetime guarantee on all their jewelry and services.
Such a fun time, super friendly, great tattoos too!< /Review>

<Date>1619411277112< /Date><pics>None<//pics><Text>My only apprehension in writing a review for Cast of Crowns is that I may lack the vocabulary to articulate just how absolutely incredible this establishment is. I have spent around 40 hours over the past 4 months being tattooed by Anthony Ianozzi. I'll start with Anthony. You cannot ask for a more consummate professional. He is punctual, extremely knowledgeable, breathtakingly talented, and incredibly welcoming. He is a master of composition and execution, particularly with respect to black and grey realism. I came in with very high expectations, and he has exceeded them at every turn. He (and every other artist) maintains an impeccably clean and sterile work station in which he produces elite caliber art. I just cannot speak highly enough of him and have been honored to spend so much time in his chair. But for me, it's not just Anthony that makes Cast of Crowns what it is. The rest of the crew rounds out the entire experience... Corey, Cierra, Marcus, Desi, Gage, apprentice Joanna... these folks make the experience thoroughly enjoyable. They're all kind, funny, welcoming, and great conversation. The music is awesome. The atmosphere/design is beautiful and upscale. The views of the Pacific are a sight for sore eyes. It is simply a genuinely enjoyable social experience to spend an afternoon (or 8!) in Cast of Crowns. I endorse Cast of Crowns in the strongest possible terms. Please feel free to reach out directly with any questions related to my experience.< /Text>< gmapID>

<review>I was taken care of by James, extremely helpful and caring, made sure I felt comfortable since this was the first modification that I had. Definitely reasonable price. The shop is a safe environment from my own knowledge very clean and comfortable. Wouldn't trust anyone else for modifications . I went to 3 other people and james is by far the best in pricing, comfortably, and artwork. Definitely want to go back for more modifications in the future<//review>< response>

Love the service here! My friend and I got Gage who did our lobes and conch. The piercings didn't even hurt and aftercare was super easy/had no complications. I've been pierced 10x before and this has been my best experience. I highly recommend this studio for their piercings.<//Review>

<review>After a lot research, I brought both of my daughters to Gage for ear piercing.  Needle piercing is far better and less painful than using a gun, which is sadly how mine were pierced a long time ago.  Gage was meticulous about cleanliness and positioning the piercing correctly.  Jewelry selection was perfect and we are now converts to flat backs for everyday/24/7 wear.  Can’t recommend them enough. Plan on a follow-up visit one post your piercing.</review>< rating>

I turned 18 two days ago, and have wanted a piercing for a long time, so I went over here to get one. I had an amazing experience with Gage!! He gave me a birthday discount and everything was very clean and COVID friendly inside. Super friendly staff, would definitely recommend. Very professional and very sterile:)<//Review>

I am definitely disappointed. They list their tattoo artists on the website, so I reached out to one of them with the 3 inch tattoo I am wanting, only to be told they don't do work that small. Ok.😥 I did give them 3 stars though because Corey was very polite about the rejection.< /review>

<Review>Cast of Crowns has a super inviting space and incredible artists. I went for a piercing and jewelry. They have an amazing selection of special pieces. I felt like I could take my time, Gage answered any questions I had, showed me all the jewelry I wanted to see, and told me about the artisans.  They adhere to the highest hygienic standards for sterilizing piercing equipment / jewelry and the shop was very clean.  It was a really personal experience and I felt comfortable in the space. Evan took the time to chat with me about a tattoo I want to touch up and expand on. There’s amazing artwork, shared front patio with a local restaurant and private back patio- a sweet collective space surrounded in artistic beauty! I highly recommend this spot for top quality, talented artists!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<time>1550514526954</time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>What a great place atmosphere here, artist here seem very professional make you at home. My first tattoo and Brandon took care of me. When it was time he had my full attention gave his thoughts and ideas to make this tattoo last a long time and when all was done, I was more than impressed, this guy is professional I was so full of anxiety, he found a error before we went further. That there shows his heart is in what he does. I appreciated his time. Cost was more than reasonable. Not out to extend time with a simple design. The shop in a whole was great from the first time I came in to talk with someone to the moment of the tattoo.  Thanks a lot for something that’s very meaningful to me!!! You made it come true.  God to be the Glory!!! God Bless this shop!!< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBFzqxnQ78WjeHHtni6tCAJpA61BZDB18CFeGh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

After searching for a couple years to find the right artist to do a sleeve piece I've been wanting, I stumbled upon Corey and instantly knew he was the artist I wanted. Patience, clean and precise line work, creativity, and eye for detail is something extremely hard to find and I found it all in him. The piece he did on me came out more amazing than I could have ever imagined and I have another session scheduled with him! I LOVE this shop so much and it's different than any other shop I've been in. Chill atmosphere, every artist there was super cool. The owner is super nice and was working on a killer portrait piece while I was there and it was identical to the photo provided! I highly recommend this shop!</Text>

<review>In my experience, this place feels like a home. It's warm, inviting and filled with amazing people. I gaurentee you will be greeted with a smile within minutes of walking in and someone is more than willing to help answer any questions you have.
Each artist here is one of a kind, and they've created an incredible environment that showcases their talent beyond tattooing.
Corey has given me two pieces so far, and we have more sessions to go, but in my opinion, he is one of the most talented in his craft. Besides being quick to respond to emails and on time for each appointment, he is down to earth and just all around amazing. They're professional in there own charming way and you'll never feel more comfortable in a "tattoo shop" in your life.
If you're considering getting your first or 20th tattoo, or tagging along with a friend, stop by and see what they're up too.< /review><rate>5< /rate><user_name>Teagan Sanchez</user_name></record>

This place is amazing! I had my inner conch pierced, which Gage recommended and I love it. An earring broke and he replaced it. Rad dude and place is clean and very cool and high end.
I had a consult w Brandin to get a tattoo done and he wouldn’t do it because it wasn’t perfect. He is very professional and just down to earth. Very impressed in every way with Cast of Crowns. Recommend to everyone. I will be using Brandon for every tattoo I get in the future. 👌🏼👍🏼< /Text>

<Review>This place and the artists and artistry are above and beyond what I expected.   Victor was so helpful and worked me in between his appointments.  The artwork is phenomenal.  If you are thinking about your first or your tenth tattoo, check them out.  BTW this was my first and I am a week away from my 81st birthday.  Thank you all at Cast of Crowns for making it such a memorable experience.< /Review><user_id>108845511930485930053</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Got a piercing from Gauge and the service went way beyond expectation.

The design and vibe of the studio are great. Everything is pristine and it is clear that they hold cleanliness as a top priority.

If I could leave 10 stars I would but I guess I’ll settle for 5.< /Review>

long over due - CLEAN and everyone is fantastic.  Ive received two tattoos from here  and love them both-  Brandon is super rad and very sweet extremely Genuine and most of all talented through and through. I've got about 9 tattoos - The most recent was the spin- he is very delicate, no pain- at all. some tingle but felt kinda good. They are all very good! They have sweet art and amazing jewelry outside breath taking tattoos. This is a life decision. make it worth every penny. QUALITY work love thanks Brandon. xo!!!! .</Review>

Awesome place to get your nose pierced, especially when you are old like me :) They made me feel not so old.....and welcomed me, and i was not nervous at all. The gallery is beautiful, very clean, sanitary and it was just an awesome experience. Thank you Cast of Crowns! Have wanted to get my nose pierced for 25 years !!! And now it's finally pierced!

Brandon worked on a tattoo for me today and I couldn’t be happier with the experience. The shop was beautiful and immaculate and Brandon himself was a true pro. He took the time to make sure things were perfect and then executed on it. I’m really happy with my tattoo and would recommend him to anyone who asks.< /review>

My friend and I came in today from Aliso Viejo/Orange County for body piercings. We are both in the “beauty industry” (hairstylist and esthetician) and extremely particular about where we get work done. Gage was so awesome and kind and educational! Sanitization was beyond on point as well which is important to us! We loved that all the jewelry was GOLD AND QUALITY!!! If you are looking for an awesome piercer you need to come here! We will be back for all our piercing needs! And maybe a tattoo next time!<//Text>

<Review>🌸I literally had the most comfortable piercing experience there ever. Everyone and everything from the moment you walk up the stairs is SUPER ☺ nice! I went in there on January 6th to get a two nipple piercings with Gage and he was extremely sweet and chill. Honestly, I was 😳crazy nervous😰 about getting them and he was just so supportive😊.
⭐The cleaning process was so detailed it was awesome👍 to watch! Gage made sure I knew everything was new and unopened.

🌙 The piercing process was quick and Gage definately made sure beforehand that the dots were aligned correctly. He was also very helpful with any questions or concerns that I wanted to ask.

⭐ After it was over I was ecstatic on how they came out. Absolutely perfect!

🌺P.s. : They give a bag of treats🍫 and information on the size of your piercing etc.

🌻P.s.s. : The place is extremely amazing! The art is beautiful, the environment of the place is really gorgeous, and the people there are very attentive and helpful to their customers.

🌼P.s.s.s: I also hugely recommend Gage as you notice 😄.

⭐Thank you so much Gage and also Cast of Crowns for making this a wonderful experience for me 👌. Definately will be back and HIGHLY recommending everyone.🌙< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dce4369cd2c1b1:0x9cea648dd2659333<//gmap_id></record>

As a recent college graduate from UC Santa Cruz, I was really missing the beach towns and art vibes of the city so I decided to spend the weekend in Laguna! It was my first time here and I wanted to get a memento to remember the trip.
Some of the locals suggested Cast of Crowns, and the first thing I noticed was how insanely beautiful the place is. There was a large deck with an ocean view to hang out on, and I was surrounded by gorgeous paintings from the bevy of in-house artists.
Ciera was the piercer on hand, and she was by far the most comforting yet professional body art practitioner I've ever had the pleasure of meeting! She was super bubbly and made me even more excited to be there. We went over what I wanted, a simple nostril stud, and then she painstakingly helped my indecisive self pick out the perfect piece of jewelry. She answered any questions i had about the pieces with absolute ease. This girl is a straight up expert in the field.
After we had everything picked out and cleaned up, we were ready to get started! Ciera walked me through each step of the piercing, making sure I felt comfortable all along the way. The piercing itself was an absolute breeze!! Within the span of a couple deep breaths I was the proud owner of a brand new nostril piercing! Ciera got my nose all cleaned up and gave me a super detailed explanation of what to expect throughout the healing process, then we had a fun little photoshoot out on the deck so she could document the piercing.
This was by far the best experience I've had in a tattoo/piercing shop. Even though I don't live in Laguna, this place is my new regular stop whenever I want to get adorned with some new body art.<//Text>

<text>Called to ask about getting gauges and after driving 20+ minutes to get there they wouldn’t sell me the jewelry because the piercer wasn’t there. How the hell are you going to run a business around pierces when they aren’t there. You might as well just save your damn money and only be open when you have a piercer so you can actually get something done.</text>< pictures>

Pleasantly surprised at the professionalism, the cleanliness, and the entire staff. Dr. Herbert was amazing, very informative and funny! Lisa helped me pick out frames for my progressive glasses. She was patient, helpful and so sweet. She was essential in helping me pick out the right frame for me. So happy!<//Review>

<Review>I always have a great experience here, from the time I walk through the door.  All staff are courteous and helpful from the receptionist to the opticians. The doctors are knowledgeable and caring.  They communicate information clearly and listen to any questions or concerns I have.  They have the most up-to-date equipment so you know you are getting the best care.  I highly recommend them!<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< rating>

I have been going to Dr. Beach since I was 8 years old. He knows my eyes and how I like to see. He’s a perfectionist and I love that. The staff is extremely kind. Each time I call or come in they are very professional. Samantha is a long time employee and makes me feel at home when I come in.< /review>

<review>My grandaughter was referred to this group for a followup exam and she was treated so well with such caring we decided to switch providers for the whole family!  Dr. Beach is a wonderful man who explains the testing and examination very well.  His staff is supportive and also professional and very caring.  The selection for glasses is extensive and affordable. I can enthusiastically recommend this provider for eye health.< /review>< pictures>

The doctors and their team at Napa Valley Optometric Group provide professional and caring service to my family. From the moment we get our contact lenses or glasses, we also receive a service to make sure everything is fitting right and comfortably. Everyone in the office is friendly and takes an interest in our lives. I recommend NVOG to anyone who is looking for quality service.</Review>

<Text>I was sad to see Dr Fugit who I’ve been seeing for 15 years had retired. I saw dr Herbert who was wonderful, very thorough and not rushed at all. The staff from the minute I walked in to paying on my way out were professional and personable at the same time. The lady who fixed my glasses and helped me pick a new pair was very helpful and the young Landry who took me in the room and did pictures was absolutely adorable. I don’t look forward to going for eye checkup but this visit was enjoyable. I wouldn’t go anywhere else< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808506e99c5960ef:0x76f31be9755b5f24<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I judge a good business by how they conduct themselves when things go wrong.  While I have only had a few issues in 15+ years (one of which occurred last week) they went above and beyond my expectations each time to fix the problem.  In doing so they 100% gained my loyalty and trust.< /Review>

I am so happy to have found Dr. Sam and the wonderful staff at NVOG. My last visit included a remapping of my eyes (not a tech term) which revealed an improvement in my overall eye health. Nice to know that my vision is getting better with age - maybe it's due to the attention to details by Dr. Sam and NVOG staff!< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I have been a patient for more than 29 years and I visit the office annually. I have never encountrted a single problem. Not one. The staff is excellent in providing quality customer serive. The doctors are excellent, both Dr.Samuel Herbert and my recently retired doctor, Dr. Tempus Fugit. Ihave recommended many people to go to their office over the years and I continue to do so. Good job Napa Valley Optemetrics. Keep up the good work and God will continue to bless your business.< /review>< pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Dr. Fugit is a wonderful doctor. He takes the time to explain what is going on with my eyes and the best way to help the issues I am having with them. Dr. Fugit's has an amazing staff as well.
I had an eye infection and the office was closed. Dr. Beach was still in the office and said he would be glad to see me since Dr. Fugit had left for the day. How many doctors do you know that would do that?
Thank you Napa Valley Optometric Group.

This is actually not a bad place. It’s just a tiny place and there are a lot of trucks coming in at same time that’s y there is always chaos. Come from the w oaks blvd and wait behind all other trucks once u reach stop sign go in the trailer and check in there and then wait in your truck they will call u once they have open dock for you. Yes this whole process take 5 to 6 hours for unloading. They do have nice clean restroom near dock number one. Docks are tight, years of trucking experience comes in handy at this place. No overnight parking at this facility. But go to nearest casino (Thunder valley casino parking lot number 2)they have nice big parking for trucks it’s only 4 miles away.< /Review>

Don't come more then 45 min before 15 to 20 min will take you in line for check In they don't checked in early then 30 min. Otherwise you will be told to come back and it's hard to find parking near around no parking at close by.<//Review>

Very hard to find entrance. Stay on sunset and look left for entrance. No signs except little ass ones you can't see. check in  1:30 and park on left. You can check in 1 hour before your appt. unload time isn't bad. Decent place. No overnight parking.</review>

You can only check in 30 mins prior to appointment. Pull all the way to the left once your in line because it's tight. Check in at the trailer. They'll call you for a door. Longest wait time is them to tell you your lumper fee. The bathroom is to the left all the way around the building.
No onsite parking but Thunder Casino has huge clean parking 4.5 miles away<//review>

You’d think accountability should be something that just is right? This isn’t a review of just UNFI it’s a review of almost every grocery DC in America. Want cheaper food prices? Want to run more miles and get in and out? It won’t ever happen. These places are over run and over stocked. The lumper service costs are ridiculous but always have been and receivers that drag their feet and only care about their own paycheck along with bad management are very valid reasons. When you charge $254 for a rescheduled appointment, that cost gets passed on to the consumer which by the way is all of us 👍🏼

It’s also not all their fault either. Late drivers, no shows, shady trucking companies and even shadier brokers all play a role in why these places are a total train wreck. Accountability is across the board to everyone. We all want to make money and have a decent life! It’s too bad everyone can’t work together so that happens. Make no mistake..... there is no more all for one one for all out there. It’s every man for himself. As a whole.... of course there are wonderful people out there who work hard and have compassion and empathy for those around them. But in a big picture it’s selfishness. Me first. All about me me me. From the top of the chain CEO at UNFI all the way down to the janitor.

If everyone would realize we all for the most part want the same thing then life would run so much smoother. My suggestions?

When you see your fellow driver struggling to back into a spot, HELP THEM. Those of you that just sit and watch are part of the problem not the solution. Let people merge in. Be kind to the people that you deliver to and pick up from!! It’s not personal! Help each other as much as possible in every aspect of life and I’m willing to bet the 4 and 5 hour waits at grocery DC’s would drop. We all have bad days and bad weeks and bad years sometimes...... try to remember you aren’t the only one on this planet. Your problems and concerns and issues aren’t mine or the lady at the shippers. We all have problems and issues 👍🏼 A little accountability, empathy and compassion can go a very long way.< /Text>

<text>They don't care about small business, only large accounts.  We even offered to pick up the order and would order weekly more than required amount if not way over and nobody cares unless you are a huge carrier.  We have to buy from third party and they charge us twice as much.  We have tried for years and nobody cares and they are only 20 min from our business.  Rude and hard to even get someone to call us back.   They are just another corporation all about large business.  Very disappointed and why sign us up for business account and never help us.<//text><rate>1</rate><Name>l Miller< /Name><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

Friendly staff! Felt welcomed. I was looking for breakfast meat to cook while camping but they did not have any refrigerated meats. The young gentleman at cash register sold me sausage that they use on their menu. I was so grateful! Thanks for great service!<//Text>

I love this little market along the Bob Jones Trail. Their food is delicious, they have a small outdoor patio to work seating & they have incidentals you may need for a beach day, small gifts & toiletries you may have forgotten on vacation. I would give it 5 stars but the line isn't managed and it is crowded when you wait for the register. If they could mark the ground and enforce distancing it would be 5 ⭐.<//review>

I enjoyed stopping here to grab a glass of wine. I didn't get to see much of the marketplace, but the patio was great.</Text>

Wood stone Market Place is located on the Bob Jones Trail.  The food and coffee are very good.  There is a charming patio that looks out on the trail.   It is a great place to stop for refreshments.< /text>

I always enjoy my visits to Woodstone Market. Their salads are delicious and always fresh, quiche is outstanding, and I'm a huge fan of their pizza!  Also a good coffee stop.< /Review>

You would think they want their food to at least come close to the menu description.  I think they have lost their desire. All the residents go there, why try. Pickles so so. Salad was bland and oily. Pastrami so dry. Menu description included dijon but sandwich had none.</text>

A chicken chipotle sandwich and a side of smoked salmon with a cold drink on a beautiful patio on the bob jones trail. Great food and desserts. This place is a hidden gem.< /Text>

Have lived in the area for 20+ years and was just shocked that this place exists! Walked the Bob Jones trail and stopped for lunch. I had a Cobb salad...it was very fresh and good. There is seating inside and out! Self serve drinks...served lunch. Great gift shop, cards, and salads and meals to go. They also have dinner specials...we will be back!<//review>

So this is a deli/market place. We get our drinks and other necessities when a woman starts to order her food but has a million questions. Then proceeds to get on the phone with her friend. What do you want? Cappuccino? Latte?? Cinnamon.... All the while we are standing there and are ready to check out... That's not the best customer service. If she wasn't ready then the cashier should have taken care of us while she got her info to really order<//text>

Stopped in since we are in the area on a camping trip looking for some munchies.  Didn't find anything that caught any of our eyes, staff didn't welcome or assist us in any way. The food seemed a little high as if we went shopping on Hollywood blvd.<//Review>

Woodstone market offers a variety of fine deli style foods with a posturing of elegance.  Poor people keep driving, you can't afford to eat here and they certainly don't want you here.<//review>

Very nice little market, stopped by after bike ride on Bob Burns Trail.

Best breakfast burrito in a long time - had the eggs, cheese and chorizo with potatoes on side and side of salsa. Eggs were the best prepared, better than the omelets I've had on this trip.<//Review>

Wanted my 2 year old son to try the black bean and corn salad to make sure he liked it before I purchased. The older man behind the counter was very rude in his words and tone, said they don’t give samples. It’s fine that he wouldn’t give a sample to my son, but his tone was Disgusting and he obviously didn’t want to help any customers. I was very embarrassed when another customer heard the way he spoke to us and agreed how rude he was. We are locals and always support our community but we will not be continuing to shop here anymore and I will spread the word the way we were treated.<//Review>

<Review>I love this place!! I visit here almost once a week. Great food, reasonable prices, and I just love chilling on the patio next to the Bob Jones Trail. My favorite is the seared tuna salad with a really fabulous cucumber & wasabi dressing. My friend's parents go every Monday night for Prime Rib dinner which sells out. This is a hidden gem for us locals!< /Review>< Rate>

Worst customer service ever. Sold me food to go even though I didnt request it, then wouldnt let me eat it there because I had a to-go container. Rode in on a rental bike from my near by hotel so couldn't take it to go so I asked if I could change my order to eat in and she would not allow it. Never got kicked out of somewhere as a paying customer. Prices are very high. Pizza is ok but I could not believe she would not let me eat in the restaurant or outside seating after I bought food from her.</text>

<text>Food is alway great and the service wonderful. The environment is always clean and it’s great to sit outside to dine. It’s a little pricey but considering the location it’s worth it!!</text>< Time>

The breakfast is great and the lunch too.  Salads are huge so you can share one for sure.  Burger and wraps are great.  The menu changes and there are specials.   The
Prices are great  and you can't beat the nice staff!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Quaint little place to shop and has very good food, however the service could be better. I have been in there about 4 different times and the same woman always takes our order. She's super friendly to her regulars, but seems a little put out by visitors and can be rude. It's a shame when the marketplace is so cute and has so much to offer.< /text>

< Review>
The owner won’t allow using the take away cups for coffee to be used on the patio... if they provide them,then let them be used where the purchaser want to use them. No reasonable explanation given. My wife prefers hers in a paper cup because it keeps the coffee hotter longer. We used to go weekly. We haven’t been back.< /Review>

<Review>Had the pesto chicken pizza today and the first few bites were good but as you kept eating it started to taste really bad. Really nice tourist place to stop and pay too much for local wines but they do have a decent market for basics like milk, snacks, and they sell unique knick knacks.

The people there are really nice and are more than happy to help. It's a nice place to stop and see but for me the food wasn't good enough to come back.< /Review>< pictures>

We love Woodstone and the food is amazing, I have a weakness for the chipotle chicken sandwich. However, when I called to place my order the phone rang for about three minutes with no answer so I tried calling six more times and on the 8th call a  young man answered with no energy or kindness he was very rude rushing me through my ordered and when I asked what desserts were available he told me I would have to look when I got there. Halfway through my order he seemed very distracted almost as if I was wasting his time by spending my money there. Before I could ask for my total the young man hung up on me, by that point I was so annoyed I questioned whether or not to cancel and take my business somewhere else. This is not the first time the customer service has not been up to par, the younger kids that work there need a course in hospitality asap. Its a shame something like how you answer the phone and take orders could sway future customers from not having the privilege of tasting your delicious meals.</Review>< gmapID>

Ordered two #4. Turkey club. The turkey was  pressed turkey. Picked out the supposed turkey, which left a BLT on toast, lots of bread and lettuce. The French fries were good. I know they're trying to reopen and want them to do well. I'll go for something else next time.<//text>

Fantastically diverse Menu offerings.  A little on the pricy side.  Invitingly large indoor dining area as well as a modest patio for temperate days.
Very friendly and accommodating servers were present when we visited.<//review>

A bit pricey at around $17 per person depending on customization but worth every dollar. Fresh food made to order. Pastrami cheeseburger has Pastrami on top and bottom which is an excellent touch. Come here when you have time to eat slow and enjoy every bite whilst taking in the scene.< /Review>

Love this place, make me feel like a kid walk into a amusement park. Interesting and wonderful decorations everywhere. Look around the wall and it will take you a history tour instantly.
Very friendly services and of course delicious food. Definitely one of the best diner around LA.</Text>

Rude drive thru service. I waited over 5 minutes and no one greeted me or asked me to wait. I said hello but no one responded so I just left. Clearly they don't care about their service.<//review>

Really good food. My favorite food to eat here is their pastrami sandwich, followed by the patty melt. But decided to get there nachos supreme and I was so glad that I did! It was delicious and very filling. There was enough to share if I wasn't so hungry. Their menu is pretty diverse and even have a few breakfast items that are available all day. Large parking lot and the drive thru is easy to navigate even with a truck.</Text>

Went to this place on Sunday afternoon for about an hour w mom and sister.  Little car show in parking lot.  Everybody calm and having a good time.  Nice old-time music (50s and 60s).  Had Coke floats...tasted great.  Good employees.  Definitely recommend.</Review>

New best item is the banana pudding, reminds me of being a kid again. Best pastrami’s around, even better than that other place down the Route. Burger combos can’t be beat. All the salads are crisp and large portions served. Sometimes it’s hard to make up our minds, but the servers there are always extremely courteous, respectful and always very patient.
Food is always served in about the amount of time that you would imagine, they don’t cook it till you order it, they don’t profess to be fast food but very tasty and enjoyable food.

Just had a double burger,  so dry! literally eating a spoon full of  Peanut butter. Wow! water please. Tasteless meat, blandthe only thing that has flavor is the pickles. Normally you would see the meat just drip with juices, not here. Then we have the Chile cheese frys, $4.50 for the small and yes its small. Not too much chili, you literally must grab the frys and try to scrape the walls of the container in order to get some chili  on them. This dry burgers killing me.< /Text>

Because our food is made to order, you could always request extra dressing, or perhaps the cook that day just didnt put enough.  Usually our chili fries is overflowing with chili, so I will definitely look into that.I hope you'll give us another shot to impress you in the future. -Peter Tsianos, General Manager"}<//Response>

<text>The food is great the staff is very friendly. I had a breakfast burrito it was great. Just a suggestion you should be able to buy french toast or pancakes at anytime if you can make that happen they would be great. Today's visit definitely a 5 star. Once again if you can make that happened breakfast pancakes or french toast that will be wonderful

Thank you< /text>< pictures>

Then to top it off the fries were overcooked and under seasoned. Dry and almost plain. I paid $8 for a combo and they gave me a child size cup. They also didn't provide napkins.<//Text>

WOW!  This was appealing outside and then the inside decorations were awesome and takes you back about 65 years.  The food was fresh, filling and yummy yummy.  Tonight they had homemade banana pudding for $1.75. A big portion at a retro price. We loved our experience and the workers were very helpful with whatever we needed. The owner came to our table to check on us. Really a fun time. Highly recommend this establishment.</review>

The food is quite good and far too much! We ordered a large salad, a small onion ring, small fries and a large coke. The 2 of us couldn't eat it! The atmosphere, the legendary music make this place worth visiting. Classic place on the classic route 66.</text>

The food is great the staff is very friendly. I had a breakfast burrito it was great. Just a suggestion you should be able to buy french toast or pancakes at anytime if you can make that happen they would be great. Today's visit definitely a 5 star. Once again if you can make that happened breakfast pancakes or french toast that will be wonderful

Thank you< /review>

Not the best food, but there are many options and I appreciate the variety. They have some cool sides to choose from such as breaded mushrooms and zucchini. They are a bit too breaded but still pretty good. Also have Mexican food here with a salsa bar.</review>

My baby girl made a mess around our table and when I tried cleaning it up the waitress was really kind and said not to worry about it. Then when I put away the high-chair she thanked me and said she was really grateful for it because most people don't do that. She went above and beyond to make my family and me feel comfortable. She deserves a raise!</Text>

<rating>4</rating><text>My first time there and went with a friend. Place is a little pricey, $13 talking about splitting a pastrami sandwich but it's a lot of meat and it's very thinly shaved. Unlike the hat and many other restaurants that seem to have good pastrami but just a little on the chewier side this is very thinly sliced and wasn't chewy at all. Probably one of the better pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. Just comes on a simple roll with mustard and pickles. I noticed everybody around me was eating fried zucchini fries as they refer to them which are the thinner zucchini like a french fry that are crispy all the way through not soggy on the inside. I decided to go for onion rings which were good but I've definitely had better. But they were tasty.  Saw they do fries, sweet potato fries, fried mushrooms. They also have a milkshake and ice cream bar ready to make you a Sundae.< /text>< Pictures>

I have eaten at Legends in Upland before but my first time at this location. We got burgers which were ok. The onion rings i was not impressed with. My daughter got chili cheese fries and the chili is not that good. It reminds me of Farmers nasty chili. My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito which he was not impressed with. I felt it was overpriced and was not happy with the food. I won't be going back. I would ho to Terrys burgers in Upland next time where their food is so much better.<//Review>

<Text>Food was amazing.. Our first time. I know it's Sunday, the place was packed and very little choices to sit. BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS DIRTY. Even spillage all over the floor. When they slowed down, then they cleaned the tables.. When we were leaving, we filled our sodas and there was no ice. And in either of the two machines. When I went to ask about ice I was told the only two employees that could do it were on break.. So no ice. Otherwise food was amazing..< /Text><response>{'time': 1552439471035, 'text': "Minky, we're really happy you enjoyed your visit!

Great menu, very helpful and friendly people. Traditional American fast food and Americanized Mexican food. The spicy green salsa is surprisingly good. You need to like 50s music.<//text>

< Review>
It's a great place for small groups. It's also good for just families. We usually order a large sampler (fries, onion rings, fried zucchini, fried mushrooms), which is enough for the four of us and then a burger. Overall a great family dining experience.
1. Portions are very large and satisfying. Though it may seem pricey, each order is large enough for two meals.
2. This is a diner atmosphere so don't expect much more than that. However, the vintage memorabilia add to the ambiance.
3. Staff have always been friendly and helpful.
4. Parking has never been a problem for me, but I haven't been there at peak hours.<//Review>

Diner was very nostalgic.  Felt like we went back to the 50's.  Cool decor,  if you're into that era.  Ordered classic diner food, cheese burger, fries and onion rings.  The burger was very cheesy and the meat was just the right thickness.  Reasonable prices and very friendly waiters.  Want to return for the milkshakes, which I've heard are delicious.< /Text>

<text>Legends is one of my favorite fast food joints. The chicken strips meal with a salad is a great way to split lunch with my 6 year old. I love their salads. Their fries are great.

<Text>The diner inside was cool...the food,not so much...I got a sampler platter  and it was mediocre barley warm,the fries were soggy and limp,the onion rings (2 our of 5) were burnt and cold,the mushrooms we're warm,as were the zucchini stix (but not fresh or hot)
So I took this and asked for the manager,after being told to wait,he could not be found,and a boy came up and said how can I help you I told him the situation and even showed him the onion ring and while standing there threw the burnt onion rings in the trash.he told me that he would tell his fry Cooks about them and that it wouldn't happen again ....and as he turned and  walked away,I said, 'Are you the manager?"and he said, well no, I'm the person in charge at this time. which obviously he was not the manager and they couldn't find the manager...and what should have happened is he replaced what I threw in the trash but he didn't.
So there's the one star ...
If I could give none I would.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1559253783214, 'text': "Dianelaine, thank you for bringing this to our attention.

<Review>The environment is great With oldies classics playing over the speaker system, nostalgic pictures covering the walls, it brings back thoughts of  a time long past. The food is good and large portions, but don't expect to get out of there spending less than $30+ for two.

Oh... We have ordered shakes and malts on numerous occasions and although their large malts and shakes are really, really large, they have a very different aftertaste; we don't order them any more.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1521752493546, 'text': "It's great to hear you're a fan of our food and atmosphere, Franklin!

Delicious breakfast. Hearty and perfectly priced. I had the avocado omelet. It overflowed with cheesy avocado goodness. Eggs tasted fresh and hash browns were perfectly cooked. I cannot wait to try other items on the menu.<//text>

This one of my favorite Legends Classic Diners.  It is a ways from home however they have a very fun car show the 1st Sunday night of the month. You can't beat great food, great cars and good friends. They have great desserts and offer both Malts and Shakes all hand dpped and made fresh. Food is very large portions and I have yet to order and not love what I have received.< /text>

This is a really good choice for a fast meal that isn't a chain.  Their menu is huge and everything I've tried is really good.  My favorites are the fried chicken and french fries.  So good!  Their Gyro has lots of tender meat -excellent!  The decor is cool- socal diner surfer and it's always clean.  The staff is very friendly too!  Give them a try!<//Review>

First time here, wow, there is so much cool memorabilia here on the walls and items hanging from the ceiling. Guitars, surfboards, street signs, a juke box, and if you sit in one of the table booths to eat, notice the old time soda bottle caps cemented into the wall.

A 50's themed diner, with a fairly broad menu.  Tasty enough.  Every Veteran"s Day, there is a great muscle car show there.  Nice cars, nice folks, low key affair and cheap (as in free for the car show, not the food - duh!)< /Review>

Pastrami burgers, zucchini fries, onion rings, french fries, chili cheese burgers, club sandwiches, tuna melts, breakfast burritos. All of them are fantastic. I love going here, even if my diet doesn't love it so much. Plus the classic decor is awesome, the walls are covered with classic stars. I find myself often staring at the wall decor every time I go.</review>

Great retro 50's-60's dinner in the heart of Glendora. Menu consists of hamburgers, some mexican dishs and sandwiches for lunch and dinner with also a morning breakfast menu. They also have a kids menu. Decor celebrates the "soda shop" atmosphere combined with the history of being on the historic Route 66 highway.< /text>

<text>Interesting diner style restaurant. They have allot of little curiosities around to look at. I had the pastrami and chili fries, both tasted pretty good. Price was resonable too. It's not fast food but a good place to try.< /text>< resp>

<text>After leaving Doughnut Man, we saw the very distinctive sign, googled it and saw it had 4.5 (4.5!!) Stars and thought, man this place has to be good. The decor and atmosphere are the best thing about it, I think. Very cute, nicely put together. We got a classic cheeseburger with chili cheese fries and a turkey club. I gotta be honest, it was ok. Good but nothing to write home about.  It was a fun 30 minute stop, but I can't see myself going back.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Pastrami burgers, zucchini fries, onion rings, french fries, chili cheese burgers, club sandwiches, tuna melts, breakfast burritos. All of them are fantastic. I love going here, even if my diet doesn't love it so much. Plus the classic decor is awesome, the walls are covered with classic stars. I find myself often staring at the wall decor every time I go.</Text>

<Text>The service was very slow. We were a party of 2, and 2 larger parties that came in after us received their food before us, our order was not a complicated order, a quesadilla and a salad.. There were more that 8 tables that were dirty and needed to be cleaned. Trash on the floor. None of the employees seemed concerned. The self serve soda machines were out of ice. It was not crowded,  time was 7:00pm.
Not to sure if we will return to soon.</Text><response>{'time': 1518284700872, 'text': "I'm sorry the service wasn't as attentive as it should have been, Daniel.

I ordered a pastrami sandwich, fries and a chocolate shake. The pastrami was a good size - especially with fries and a shake.  It was, however, a bit too dry for me. The fries were okay but the shake was really good. Nothing too special but I Di see some ice cream creations that looked great!< /Review>

Prepare yourself for the incoming food coma. Great tasting burgers with their amazing pastrami chili cheese fries. Nice theme with enjoyable music but can get crowded on the weekends at night.<//text>

While I visit regularly, typically it's a very friendly atmosphere. However, the drive thru people could  use a lesson on manners and customer service. While asking for a drink carrier, I was handed the drinks, then the carrier for me to put them in. Should have been put in before handing off to me. The girl at the window, then shoves  my food order at me and says"here.".  Then shuts the window before I could ask for condiments. I waited a minute or so to get her attention to ask for some ketchup. She never returned.< /text>

Prepare yourself for the incoming food coma. Great tasting burgers with their amazing pastrami chili cheese fries. Nice theme with enjoyable music but can get crowded on the weekends at night.< /review>

I wish their breakfast menu wasn't limited after 11am because I was really craving the French toast since I walked in...

< Review>
Waited 20 mins. in line last night (which is expected for this place) just to get a cold burger and soggy fries. The young lady didn't know how ring up my order and didn't listen carefully while I was ordering. I don't mind waiting for hot food but making a customer wait and then giving them cold food is just disrespectful. My food was so cold I didn't even finish eating it. Also turning off the headset would be a good idea as I heard everything that was being said while the young lady was trying to figure out how to ring up the order. I definitely will be going to Grand Burger for now on.</Review>

The last time I was there they burnt my stake sandwich and I had to wait over 20 minutes to get my food and it was only a small order.

I do enjoy the food when it's not salty but the wait in the drive-thru is getting longer and longer just for a few items.</review>< pictures>

<text>Too much food, nothing healthy on menu. Everything I have ever had here was greasy, salty. That said, my family likes the chicken fingers and shakes here; I come along under duress.  The walls are covered on 2 1/2 sides with memorabilia that refers to, but is not from, the '50s.  The other 1 1/2 walls have a poorly drawn mural that these places all seem to have. Jukebox plays oldies, loudly at times. Bottom line: poorly imagined '50s dinner with below par food.< /text><rate>3<//rate><userid>114016879405890758523< /userid>< Response>

<review>Food wasn't too shabby for a diner. Huge meal cost a little over 20 dollars.

We had a bacon avocado burger with added pastrami a side of zucchini fries and to wash it all down with a thick strawberry milkshake.

Don't forget to bring cons for the juke box and take the extra time to look at all the paraphernalia on the walls.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<text>It's our second time here in a month and the same effortless service from the same cashier, she doesn't show any enthusiasm and she doesn't seem to be happy with her job, it's a drag on what the restaurant's setting is aiming at, and it's a shame the service has gone down the drain, the good thing is they're hiring, maybe if you're reading this you can help make a better first experience for future customers. Overall great food at a reasonably price, thumbs down on the service< /text><user_name>Pedro Munoz< /user_name>< gmap_id>

The staff has no grasp on how to assign and stay on one job, instead they talk and decide to do as little as possible, you can almost see how much the staff doesn't want to be there let alone how unprofessional these people are, i wouldn't eat here unless you want to have the stomach flu, the only thing the owner and his wife care about are yelp reviews.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><text>Today was the 1st time we came to try this place out. I was looking for restaurants in Glendora, where my brother lives (he recently moved there). I found this place on here (I like to read reviews that also has the owner/manager replying back to the reviewer, this tells me that they care & a sign of great customer service 👍) & told my brother to meet us here for lunch.
It was a great place!!! I like all the decor, from classic license plates to photos of Lucille Ball, Audrey Hepburn, Betty Boop & lots & lots of memorabilias that I could just read & look at. This resto felt welcoming, spacious & nostalgic. It reminds you of the fun, good old days, no worries at all.... Oh BTW the food is very good!!! My sons like the chili cheese  burger combo, my brother had the pastrami (pretty good portion of pastrami 👍) & I had the mess burrito. Sooo many to choose from. They also have other condiments, 4 different salsas, huge jalepenos, onions/cilantro (I think that's what it looks like) & pickled small yellow peppers/carrots/onions. When we get a chance to come back I'd like to try the French toast, didn't make it before 11am ☹️, next time. Overall 👍👌</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1526480477590, 'text': "Jen, thank you for the wonderful feedback! We're so happy you enjoyed the mess burrito and atmosphere.

<review>I been here before with my sisters, they seem to like here, burgers are ok, I had better, on this occasion I tried the pastrami burger I liked the pastrami, burgers still the same as last time just ok. Place this time was not that clean, the salsa area there was a dark liquid coming out from underneath the container dispenser, which I brought to their attention and was clean right away.</review>< pics>

<review>Ever meet someone who is always with whatever is the hot in "thing" but you still dont want to be around them?

Thats kinda what I feel about Legends Classic Diner

Its amazing how you put a bunch of crap on the walls and people get all "jazzed" about a theme.

The real theme of this place is deep fried not that great food.

I have been here more times then I like to recall because it took quite a few times to convince people that this place just isn't good.

I will say that nothing is horrible. Just nothing stands out at all and considering how much fat is in everything and the fact I can bump into a Greek burger place with my eyes closed.

Almost everything deep fried is overcooked and dry. The food is also just bland.

Feel free to come here just dont come crying to me about it.</review>< pics>
