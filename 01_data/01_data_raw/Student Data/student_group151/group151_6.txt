< Review>
I CANNOT recommend this class more. Seriously. I've been attending Todd's class for about 6 months and it has honestly been one of the most wonderful class experiences I've had as an actor, anywhere. He seems to hit the nail right on the head week to week with our discussions on the business and current events. I find it to be very motivational and sort of exactly what I need to hear which makes me think Todd might be psychic. Really, he is super knowledgeable about the industry in all aspects. Plus he's easy to talk to, work with, and you kind of always wanna be around him.

You also gotta love the fact that this class breaks down and works on COMEDY, specifically, in a way you might not necessarily think to do with comedy auditions and scripts! The price is WORTH it, the $20 workshops are unbeatable, and the vibe In class is super fun and chock full of talent. Couldn't recommend it more for my comedy peeps in L.A! Get in it while you can....the wait list is gonna get REAL.< /Review>

It is hands down the best acting instruction I've received.  I've been a student here since January. Todd was great at pin-pointing strengths and weaknesses and creating a nurturing environment.  His knowledge of the business is phenomenal...he always on top of the latest news that effects the comedy actor.  In this amount of time I've gotten an agent, made great contacts and my career is moving forward faster than ever.

The workshops are awesome, with talented guests and a great price.  I highly recommend ACS if you're looking to improve as both an actor and person.  He's that good.<//text>

I can say with certainty that my work has gotten cleaner, crisper, more free, and funnier as a result. Todd's an amazing teacher, and since some of the other teachers have subbed once in a while, I've learned that they're amazing, too. I've been involved in acting and comedy for a long time, and this place is the real deal. Great work is happening here constantly! Their $20 workshop program is just the latest in the exciting stuff they offer. Seriously, I've got a strong BS-detector, and there's none here. Just a great, supportive environment that will push you to give your best.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Just took the Comedy Cast Intensive last week and loved it so much I had to write about it! Dorian and Gunnar work so well together. They are such a wonderfully well rounded team. And Dorian's manner was so surprisingly pleasant. She had this amazing ability to guide our acting skills in a way that made us feel like we were more empowered individuals after.  I got so much from Gunnar and Dorian on their experience and insights into the industry. It was an invaluable step into my career! The all-day intensive took out so much guessing. I just love this school! It's exactly what I've been looking for to expand my career!< /review>< pics>

<userid>107089479397871903867< /userid><Text>I have been studying at the Actor's Comedy Studio for 9 months now and cannot see myself taking classes elsewhere.
Not only is Todd incredibly observant and knowledgeable, but he represents your biggest motivator and fan in a town where true supporters are hard to come by.  And everyone at the studio help in any way they can, becoming friends in the process.
The classes are great for actors and sitcom writers as you study what makes jokes work from both sides of the coin, and the different characters on sitcoms you will portray.  After only a few classes, you'll know what your "type(s)" is/are and be able to polish your characterization while always maintaining the humor of each scene.
For a fun time and advancement in the industry, I highly recommend Actor's Comedy Studio.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><rating>5<//rating><time>1367565339338< /time><gmapID>0x80c2b92ea9286e1d:0x30fef0916ad69aa3</gmapID><name>Andy Wasif<//name></record></dataset><record>

Love this place.

Todd is so knowledgeable and helpful and the entire staff is incredibly professional. The actors are taped and critiqued every class and given different material that's chosen for them every week so you learn how to give a quick read and work out a script fast. You're also given audition techniques and upcoming changes in the film and tv industry that pertain to your career.

100 percent worth every penny.</review>

Todd is incredibly forthcoming with his industry knowledge and is really invested in his students' success.

I love being in an environment where the other students are committed actors who take their work seriously.  If you're interested in sitcom training this is the place to study!< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Hands down the best acting studio in LA! The classes are excellent and affordable - a rare find in this city. Lauren and Todd are absolutely amazing and know how to work with their students to bring out each one's maximum potential. The energy in each class is unmatched at the other studios that I've been to, and the personalized communication and advice from the teachers shows me that they truly do care about my success and are not just out to make a quick buck. I love ACS and give it my highest recommendation.< /Review>< UserId.>

This class is amazing it focus's on the part of comedic acting that we need to focus on and that is finding the characters that work best for us and making sure that the first impression that casting directors get from you is the best one.  Most classes focus on what comes after you get the part, this class helps you give a great performance and really dive deep into a character when you only have 20 minutes to look at sides before you are in front of the camera trying to land the part.

Todd has an incredible way of giving feedback that not only helps you as an actor but as a person. He helped me (and is still helping me) get over my insecurities as an actor and every class I feel my self getting better.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I have been going to ACS for about 4 months now and I can definitely say that it's best Acting Studio I have ever been to. Not only is it just comedy training and audition technique, but Todd instills a confidence in you that you wont be able to find much elsewhere. He is a phenomenal teacher, who loves what he does, and that translates extremely well into his agenda. I love it here and won't be going anywhere else for a while< /Text>

Being a part of Actors Comedy Studio has been one of the best decisions I have made so far since moving to Los Angeles. They offer weekly classes that range from the beginner actor, to the professional actor. This is a safe, skill building place where you can learn everything from the audition technique and cold reading, to character development and script analysis. It is a fun time, and can be somewhat therapeutic and relaxing, but also challenging in a positive way that helps push you to become better and better at what you love doing, acting. I have taken weekly classes for almost a year, as well as many workshops and seminars, ranging from script analysis and improv classes, to casting director workshops. If you want to be good at something, then you need to put everything you have into it. Actors Comedy Studio will give you what you are looking for.< /Text>

<review>I've had my eye on ACS for some time now and I finally had a chance to begin classes in July...What a terrific decision on my part! I love this place! Todd has a way of teaching sitcom technique that is better than any other class I've attended in LA since 2008. After taking this class, I've watched my comedy audition technique and cold reading skills improve so much! I even got a few callbacks! Lauren is amazing because she gives fantastic tips on how to master the skill of cold reading and reading out loud in general. The instructors here are very passionate about comedy and the time they take with you to assure you become a master in the comedy craft is note worthy. They also keep you up to date with the latest trends in the industry, industry news and $20 casting director workshops with NO CATCH! I highly recommend you try the studio out for yourself.<//review>< date>

Todd and everyone at ACS are an amazing team to work with! Not only is the studio well equipped and well organized, but I've never worked with a teacher who is as personally invested in the success of their students as Todd is. I came here 5 months ago with a theatre heavy background, and have made amazing strides at bringing my acting into a more nuanced, honest, and film-friendly place. As far as pricing goes, it really is rather cheep compared to most other legit acting classes out there - and I promise you'll get the most bang for your buck here!

As a working actor and member of SAG since 1994, I have seen and participated in numerous classes, workshops and acting schools. I can honestly say that if you are looking for a place to focus your comedy chops, this is the place to do it.
After taking a few years away to be a parent and raise my 3 kids, I was looking for somewhere to shake off the rust. What I found was a place to not only shake off that rust, but a place to put a fine polish on my comedic skills.
Todd Rohrbacher has a gift of pinpointing the heart of what is funny in scripted material and shows you how to do the same consistently.
Thank you Todd and Actors Comedy Studio< /Review>

I love the classes I take there. Gunnar has a unique take on comedy that will open up a whole new range of specifics to apply to any audition. He is a passionate teacher devoted to helping us succeed. The Comedy Cast intensive was also a great way to get real insight into the casting office and how to deliver in any audition.</Review>

I am going to try my best to put into words how amazing the Actors Comedy Studio is. I just finished the 10 week Sitcom Essential class and my mind is blown. I have learned more in this 10 weeks, than my college experience.  Gunnar and Lauren teach you exactly what you need in order to feel confident going out there and auditioning.

Actors Comedy Studio teaches you script analysis, helps you perform a multi camera scene in front of a live studio audience, and brings in guest speakers and teachers who come in to talk about their real experience in the industry. Every class for 10 weeks has something to learn from.

This studio is the real deal. I highly recommend this course and their other workshops to anyone looking to further their education in this industry!</Review>

I just completed the Safe and Easy Writing class with Gunnar.  A first time writer, I had been on the fence about it as I was not sure I was 'ready' to dive into writing a whole pilot, but that is exactly the reason TO take the class. Gunnar is a true expert on comedy - structure, character, what makes things funny - as well as on a vast number of comedy shows, past and present. His able to draw upon all of that makes his instruction and feedback incredibly precise and insightful.  What's more, the class is designed to be collaborative and supportive.  Not only did I walk away with a much better understanding of the structure and essential components of a strong pilot script, but an actual draft, some direction as to where to take it from here, and a great community of fellow writers - many of whom are also actors, writing material for themselves, like me.< /text>

Overall, this is a FABULOUS comedy crash course and the price point is also fantastic! Looking forward to more classes with ACS! :)< /text>< response>

<Text>I've been studying at Actors Comedy Studio just shy of two years now.  I've had the pleasure of studying & working with all of the studio's founders & teachers.  I started from the ground up with Lauren in the Foundation class then progressed into Gunnar's Master Class.  The wonderful thing about studying with ACS is not only do you get an in depth understanding of performing sitcom comedy, but also of the industry as a whole.  They are very transparent in their knowledge of the industry & do not want you to miss out on any opportunities.  They support you & celebrate you on your successes.  It is truly like a family.  I have come to grow so much as an actress, a person, & a business woman. They have really taught me to value myself & my craft. And you get to go to class every week & laugh your booty off...so what's not to like?!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>I took the Intro to Acting class at ACS, and I could not have hoped for a more encouraging or in-depth introduction to the world of professional acting. Lauren is an empathetic and knowledgable teacher who offered insightful coaching in terms of students' acting from a craft/technique standpoint, as well as the business side of the industry. Working as an actor is a career choice that now feels infinitely more accessible!< /text>< pictures>

ACS is, by far, the cleanest acting studio I've ever studied at. Its administration is handled in an organized manner. It offers well produced workshops and showcases. Gunnar and Lauren are very thorough in the way they run things. Street parking can be a bit of a challenge sometimes. I like to think that I am getting my workout in, walking a few blocks to class. The training: excellent! I've acquired sitcom acting techniques that I never knew in my decade of study. People are friendly and supportive in class. This acting studio is a gem!</text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>I just completed the Sitcom Script Analysis class with Gunnar and I have to say it was absolutely a great investment in my career as an actress and producer.

Gunnar has found a way to use his years of experience to provide useful knowledge and insight.  This mixed with his compassion, intelligence, and encouraging spirit helped our class to feel valued and inspired to get better at what we do - every day!

I can't wait to study further at Actor's Comedy Studio.

Tip:  Parking on the streets can be very difficult at certain times of the day in the area - it appears to be OK to park your vehicle at the park down the street.< /review><time>1440007223071<//time><pics>None</pics>< username>

ACS is a great place to learn acting for comedy. It's amazing how much I've learned in a short time. There are many different types of characters in comedy and Todd helps you identify the types that you are good at. He doesn't just teach how to perform. He teaches you how to analyze scripts and how to handle yourself at auditions. He's been on both sides of the camera and has an excellent eye for what works. You can see for yourself since the performances are recorded.<//Text>

I found ACS after having studied at UCB for a few years. I was looking for a place to round out my training, and ACS turned out to be the perfect solution. The Acting For Sitcoms class not only teaches you technique specifically geared towards the sitcom world, but also teaches and reinforces on-camera, audition, cold-reading technique as well. The on-going nature of the class allows them to work with you over time, keep track of problem areas, track progress, and guide you towards success. I look forward to class every week, and would recommend this school to anyone in a heartbeat You'll definitely see results!</Text>

<text>Finding ACS was the best thing that has happened for me in LA! Now that I have a clear goal of a career in scripted comedy, there is no where else I would rather study. I feel confident in my audition, script analysis, and character development skills and have a clear sense of where I fit in the marketplace.  Equally as important has been the sense of community. There is no ego at ACS- everyone works together with the vision of shared success and we help each other reach our goals. Since I started producing projects I haven't had to look elsewhere for referrals, resources, equipment, or volunteers. We all work together to make it happen! Gunnar and Lauren are the best in what they do and care about each student's individual journey.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>I have been studying here for a few years now and I still find myself learning something new every week. Gunnar always says that what separates good auditions from great auditions are mere percentage points.  The talented staff at ACS helps me fine-tune my performance so that I can go in confidently knowing that I am giving a great audition. The studio also fosters a safe and creative community outside of the classroom that allows the students to connect and work together on their own projects.  I cannot recommend ACS enough!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I'm so glad I took this class!! Gunnar's Safe and Easy Writing Class is just what I was looking for. This year I decided to write a half hour multi-cam sitcom, but I wasn't sure where to start. I have a sketch comedy writing background but I wanted help with the pilot format. Gunnar is a wealth of comedy writing knowledge. He broke everything down in such an easy way. He made it simple to generate material and kept us all hitting our deadlines in a completely fun, supportive environment! I found our group table reads to be invaluable. We were able to hear the flow of our dialogue and gauge how jokes landed. Wherever you are in your writing career, you'll walk away with great resources, new relationships…and a PILOT!!</review>

I've been a student for over 5 months now and it's been the best thing I've done for my career since I moved to LA. This class is on-camera, organized, and so much fun! It focuses on audition technique and on-camera skills, as well as the business side of being a professional actor in LA. Gunnar has found the perfect balance between being smart about your career and the truth of acting.  An essential for any actor serious about booking sitcoms!

The studio offers private career consultations, $20 workshops, and best of all, an intimate working environment with a supportive community of teachers dedicated to your success. Gunnar and Lauren are great at working with students individually and at all levels. I had no on-camera training when I started class, and after just a few weeks I felt confident and prepared to audition alongside other professionals. I can't believe how much I've learned in such a short amount of time! A must for anyone ready to take their career to the next level!< /Text></record>

<Review>After years of studying at a conservatory program for acting, taking numerous acting classes in New York with top teachers, and working with a multitude of coaches, it’s easy to become aware of and anticipate many commonalities of style and approach.

Taking class with Gunnar at ACS has been a completely new and authentic experience. His teaching method is completely unique and so helpful. Sitcom acting is incredibly stylized and specific, and Gunnar helps you understand the depth within it and encourages you to find the YOU in your work.

I’ve gained so much confidence in my work and my understanding of how to approach sitcom material.</Review>< pictures>

YES AND YESSSS

This class is literally one of the best classes I have ever taken. For those who love comedy and just want to focus on that, its a GREAT class to learn the ins and outs of all things sitcom. This class as helped me prepare for auditions and help me to analyze a scene in a short amount of time. The Ten Characters of Comedy is part of this, and wow. This really helps in breaking down a script and help understand the angle to approach from. I have booked things because of this alone.

Todd is brilliant. He genuinely cares about the person within the actor and pushes you to get it right.  He also is VERY informed about the business side as well, giving us weekly updates and all the insider trade secrets :)
The school also offers $20 dollar workshops, bringing in agents, casting directors, and important people in the biz. Its almost unfair that its $20, because every workshop is so valuable and legit. They aren't like those workshops you get in mass emails that promise you this and that and are so vague.

So. In short. YES.
I HIGHLY recommend this class and will continue to take it.

WOOTY WOOOT!!<//text>

“Safe and Easy, Sit-com Pilot Writing Class”? I would retitle this class “Safe and Priceless Writing Revelations”. I agree it was ‘Safe’ because, as always, Gunnar Rohrbacher, insures all exercises, instruction and sharing within the group maintains respect for each person who is there to learn.

Why not “Easy”? It’s not easy, in a way that connotes, kicking back and it’s all done for you with an A+B=Pilot. Your creative chops are challenged and you quickly/easily can see where you are in the process. Gunnar imparts so much valuable information, easily, but it is still up to you to ‘do the work’ and apply that to your own creation.

I say “Priceless”, because this class forces you to see and discover for yourself your skills, commitment and true interest/joy in writing. In eight weeks?! That’s “Priceless”.

For fellow actors in Gunnar’s acting classes, no matter what level, when you take this class you will experience “ah-ha” moments researching your characters for your pilot.  You will come to understand the comedic archetypes (Gunnar has told you about) from the screen writer’s point of view, and that is equally “Priceless”.

For me, I discovered I could do it…I wrote a half hour sit-com pilot in eight weeks! It confirmed, I want to continue to tell stories as an actor and as a writer.  No matter what the title, the “Safe and Easy Sit-com Pilot Writing Class” inspired me to seek beyond this one creative experience and continue to tell more stories. That’s priceless.</Text>

LA has no shortage of actors, and thus, no shortage of acting teachers. But finding an excellent one is the trick. What puts Gunnar in that category is, like any great coach in any field, he caters his message to the individual. Yes, you'll learn how to break down a script and the 10 characters of comedy, but all of this is meant to bring out the many shades of you in the room, and Todd has an uncanny ability to figure out each individual's key to unlocking his/her specific, unique colors.

At the end of the day, finding the right instructor for you is a very personal decision, and ultimately is about results. When it comes to comedy, no one has aided me better in achieving results than Gunnar. And it all comes through a non-results oriented attack that begins and ends with sharing your truth. If you're ready to share it, and have a few laughs in the process, The Actors Comedy Studio may very well be the perfect environment for you.</Text>

It's not like any other class in that is solely focused on comedy and on camera work which helps tremendously for auditions. Todd Rohrbacher is one of the best. I've watched Todd elevate good work to the "booking jobs" level. He has the insight to know what they are looking for out there and he helps actors achieve that level of specificity and truth in their work.  He is a great teacher who just knows funny and with the Actors Comedy Studio he has created a supportive and fun place to play. Every class you work and Todd is always mixing it up so it's constantly challenging and unexpected. It's hard in LA to find someone who truly cares and I highly recommend ACS for anyone looking for a sitcom class that's so much more than just taking your money.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I love Actors Comedy Studio and recommend classes to anyone who is serious about working in comedy.

Gunnar, Lauren, and all of the teachers at ACS take the time to care about each student and work with them individually in order to have the best opportunity for a long and successful career.

Classes are designed to prepare actors for working on-camera and booking roles. Since attending ACS, my acting has improved ten-fold and I can easily navigate a script in order to best personify the character, hit the jokes, and be truthful in my performance.

The twenty dollar workshops ,open to anyone, are a great and affordable way to network and perform in front of professionally working casting directors.

ACS is a fun and safe working environment where an actor can really hone their skills and become better at what they do.</Review>

While taking improv at UCB/Groundlings/etc. is great, if you really are looking to be a comedy master on Film and Television, this studio is what you need to set your sights on.

The owners Gunnar and Lauren are very knowledgable and create a positive and exciting atmosphere. There was no intimidation or judgement which is so great! In this particular class we covered everything from script analysis to differences between multi cam and single cam to representation and how the market sees you.

You also get partnered up and perform a multi cam scene in front of an audience with three cameras rolling and writers on the side who are giving you joke rewrites. No other place I know of gives you this experience, and I think it is important because if you're getting sent out for multi cam show auditions and have never been on one, you want to be as prepared as possible for how everything runs.

The community at the studio was warm and friendly from the teachers and guests to the students. At the end of the day, Gunnar and Lauren want to help actors and it shows. I highly recommend checking it out!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

This acting class is 5 star all the way.  Gunnar Rohrbacher, Lauren Bertoni and their staff at ACS are topnotch.  They're knowledgeable, supportive and passionate sans ego which are not always easy to find, I've been studying with them for over 3 years and my booking ratio has doubled.  They not only know the business  but they are also able to communicate their process in such a way that the students are able to understand and apply it to every audition and every job.  I believe every actor should be continually enrolled in an acting class and I'm happy to call this class home.< /Review>

Actors Comedy Studio is THE place to go for sitcom and scripted comedy acting. I've been taking classes there for 8+ months and seen huge changes in my technique and confidence in an audition room. Nobody breaks down a script like Todd Rohrbacher. He stays on top of business news in a way that makes you wonder when he sleeps. With a different technique being emphasized each week, there is always more to learn, always something new to challenge you and it all takes place in a safe, welcoming, playful environment. Aside from the amazing ongoing sitcom acting classes, ACS has recently started offering $20 casting director workshops. The price CANNOT be beat. All of the teachers at ACS are incredibly supportive, knowledgable, and talented.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.< /Text>

After moving from NYC, I found it nearly impossible to find a studio I was happy with, until a friend referred me to ACS. BEST investment for my career in LA! ACS has provided a creative, positive environment and has prepared me to take on this hard to maneuver town. Since studying with Gunnar, I have landed both an agent and manager. He provides the in-depth knowledge to truly understand comedy from an acting and business perspective. Gunnar is intensely passionate and “gets it.” The entire team at ACS are fantastic allies and my career has certainly benefited from it. I am beyond grateful for this gem of a studio!!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I found out about ACS through a workshop that Gunnar did in Portland, OR and fortunately decided to enroll in regular classes once I moved down to LA.  Talk about landing at the right place at the right time!  The studio has not only been an excellent place to take classes and learn as an actor, but I also value that we have a great, supportive community of super awesome peeps.

Everything the studio does is of the highest quality.  They also make a concentrated effort to make sure that their classes and workshops, though they may touch on similar topics, are distinct and unique from each other.

As far as the classes I have studied mostly with Gunnar and he is phenomenal.  He is a focused, detailed teacher and he has an amazing depth of knowledge about the industry that I consider truly invaluable.  I love that our classwork not only consists of learning so many incredible things about comedy, but also includes discussions about what is going on in the industry, developing our careers, and many other related topics that help you become a more well rounded artist. We work multiple times during class, we practice on camera, and we get specific, individualized feedback.  Gunnar is able to really zero in on who his students are, their personalities, look, etc. and helps them hone in on their individual skills to develop their comedy in a specific and unique way.

I feel super lucky that I started my journey in LA at ACS and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for excellent classes, to grow as an artist, switch things up in their career, or just connect with some terrific peeps.<//text>< Pics>

ACS not only sharpens your skills and technique to nail comedy auditions and scenes, but they arm you with the skills and tools to access your best work for comedy, drama and procedurals.  Gunnar and Lauren have created an amazing space for learning, growth and support.  Gunnar's headshot consultation allowed me to make the most of my headshot investment by giving me specific feedback on looks, styles, prep and characterization.  The Acting for Sitcoms class will push your audition skills to the next level, and allow you to breakdown scripts and uplevel your auditions.  The Sitcom Essentials class is incredible, you get insider Industry knowledge, top notch script analysis techniques and culminates in a live taping!  AMAZING!  These guys are innovative, plugged in and in the know.  They go above and beyond to ensure every student is supported and pushed to do their best work.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>ACS is THE ONLY place to train for sitcoms as far as I'm concerned. I have studied at ACS for over a year now and I have nothing but the most positive things to say about this studio and the people who run it. Gunnar and Lauren are some of the most intelligent people when it comes to knowing the ins and outs of what it is happening in situational comedy today and right now. They're eternally focused on keeping on top of what's going on in the industry and making sure they are teaching they're students what's important and how best to understand how to create the best auditions possible.
Not only is ACS an AMAZING place to train and hone your skills, but it is also a place that has felt like another home for me. Having a network of like-minded people has always been important to me for my "artistic health" and I'm so glad to say that ACS has provided a community of hard-working passionate artists that I am continually inspired by. I have the utmost respect for my peers at the studio and for Gunnar and Lauren who are two of the most inspiring individuals I have ever met. The studio that they have created is nothing short of amazing. If you are looking for amazing training in a positive environment taught by people who are on top of the industry than ACS is the right place for you.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Actors Vocal Program they offer with instructor Corinne Dekker. Yes, you heard me right. An Comedy Studio that offers amazing voice lessons. Whether you are a beginner or experienced professional, Corinne is an amazing teacher. She understands the voice and the vulnerability it can bring and she makes you feel comfortable in the classroom and explains things in a way that make you feel like you just encountered a miracle.

Go to this studio for the BEST training around.< /Review>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Woohoo is right my friends. I have found a fit for me in LA. I have a degree in theater and I have studied and done numerous shows and even showcases in LA. The transition from coast to coast from Stage to Film is extremely difficult. Actors Comedy Showcase is making me grow immensely week by week connecting talent to WORK. It's an Honor to work with both Lauren Bertoni and Gunnar Todd Rohrbacher. When I met them, they asked me what they could do for MY career and they gauge what they can do with each and every actor separately. In this studio, you compete against yourself, because there is only you. I haven't been asked that sincerely in my acting career.

ACS provides on Camera sitcom acting class in which I'm enrolled currently. To think i went to so many auditions not knowing the rules of acting on film and especially in the audition room. I have learned more in 2 months than I have the many years I have already spent in LA. They have an amazing Staff that give specific notes and you get to work through your notes after you watch yourself on Playback. To Correct and learn your mistakes. It is an efficient way to learn and improve every class.

They offer different classes, private coachings, career coachings, intensives, and schedule out several Industry showcases each month and its ONLY $20 for students and non students all the time.

The class I take begins with announcements and discussions about the trade and what is happening in the industry. At first I just learned by listening, and now I am reading everyday just to share every week. Its such a great knowledgeable vibe at the studio, actors and staff. It's worth the interview with the Co Owners right at the studio. I recommend this to any Actor or actress as it creates a network of HONEST, healthy improvement in your career.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>FACT: ACS is the only Acting Studio dedicated solely to mastering the art of Sitcom.

I started at ACS a few weeks after relocating to LA from NYC. Like any diligent New Yorker, I did my research and looked into several acting studios before landing at ACS. Diligence pays off kids. If you're serious about having a career in sitcom or if you just want to understand the science behind why some people are funny and others are not - ACS is really the only place to be.

Word to the wise, Gunnar will not let you get away with bad work - That's probably the most important thing I can say about his class. Beyond that he always provides SPECIFIC reasoning behind why it was in fact, "bad work." So much of acting (and humor in general) is subjective -  not with Gunnar. He turns comedy scripts in to easy-to-read road maps to comedy gold.

If you're ready to step it up a notch and get serious about comedy, you should probably call Gunnar... the actors going into "the room" on either side of you probably already have:)<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Gunnar, Lauren and ACS are game changers. The studio’s relevance in the marketplace is outstanding. Gunnar works with his students to build characters we can draw from and sell ourselves to sitcoms TODAY. The ACS philosophy is current. Gunnar also understands that the marketplace is constantly changing. He is clear and CONSICE, which is a rare trait for an acting teacher! Finally, and most importantly, my ACS sitcom acting class is the most FUN acting class I take.< /text>

<Review>I was studying at the Groundlings for several terms and kept seeing postcards and fliers for the Actors Comedy Studio and would take them thinking I'll call when the time is right.

It took a while, but boy am I glad I finally called!  I had heard about a different comedy coach teaching a similar style and met with him first.  I found him pompous, rude and it took his staff weeks to call back to schedule me into a class.  Thank heavens for that because I am much happier in the presence of the exceedingly bright, straight forward-without-being-rude, freaking FUNNY Gunnar, who takes comedy very seriously. He studies it, eats, lives and breathes it...to my benefit!

My husband and I were actors 15 years ago and left for the wine industry and have just recently come back.  This makes me feel like I have sooo much to catch up on and do, but just not enough time.  What I dig most is that with Gunnar, we have have eeked out a plan for my career.  So much has changed since I was previously in it, so it might seem lame to appear that I am not doing the plan entirely on my own, but I am not too proud to say that I appreciate Gunnar's expertise and SO appreciate the help.

Now, among other things, we have a production company and my husband and I wanted help with our scenes in the film.  I had worked with a couple of people whom I felt were not really that helpful.

I made an appt. to meet with Gunnar to see what he had to offer.  We clicked!  I joined the master class, filled with all sorts of inspiring talent, and my husband and I did privates with him as well.  Things that just weren't clicking at read-throughs were fixed in a NY minute with Gunnar (who used to be known as Todd, just for clarification.) We fleshed out our characters, bringing them to a much deeper level.  Good stuff!

I love being in the presence of people who are constantly working as well.  Class opens with "good news to share", and there's often a boat load! There are so many things offered such as $20 workshops, 10 week Comedy Intensives, an Industry Showcase with nothing but top-notch attendees.

I very much recommend the Actor's Comedy Studio to youth and adult actors and look forward to carving out another career for me doing what I love! Thank you to Gunnar and your entire staff! (They are very efficient and good to work with)<//Review>< Pictures>

I recently completed the Sitcom Essentials class at Actors Comedy Studio, and never was there a more appropriate name for a class. From beginning to end we learned so much about what it takes to be a successful sitcom actor. I've been "studying" sitcoms my entire life, but until you dive head first into the nuts and bolts you don't fully realize what is involved on a daily basis.

ACS founders Gunnar Rohrbacher, Lauren Bertoni, not to mention the amazing guest teachers (Elaine Hendrix, Phyllis Katz and Deb Barylski), created a warm, safe, and educational environment that was irreplaceable.

We learned about the 10 archetypal characters of comedy that are present in every sitcom, how to break down scripts in a way that gives you the most to play with, the difference between single and multi-cam auditions, what it's like to do chemistry reads with people you barely know, and the on-your-feet experience of taping live in front of an audience - complete with rewrites, line changes, and new blocking.

As an actor, I've been studying sitcoms consistently for a few years, and I have plenty of on-stage improv and theater experience, but the live taping was something I've never encountered before: to be handed 4 consecutive lines changes, all of them killer jokes, and to have less than a minute to wrap your head around it in order to nail it on take 2 is mind boggling. It's also thrilling, exciting, challenging, and most importantly, forces you to trust yourself, your homework and your training.

For me, the best take away was looking at the live taping experience as you would if you were a guest star on a show. If you're a series regular, you can make mistake after mistake and, for the most part, it's okay, you're the star. But if you're a guest star, maybe even co-star? Well, you need to nail any and all adjustments the first time. Every time. They don't have time to wait for you to get things right. And if you can nail the changes right away? That's how you work consistently and move up to bigger roles. It shows them you can handle anything thrown at you right away.

I'm so fortunate I was able to take this unique class. I feel so much more prepared for working on a multi-cam set (and single cam as well) knowing I have this experience under my belt.

If you have any interest, at all, in being a working sitcom actor, I highly suggest the Sitcom Essentials class and Actors Comedy Studio.</Review>

I have been in classes at ACS for 6 months now and I could not be happier. Todd and ACS offer much more than classes and workshops. ACS offers a blueprint of how to build a successful career in this industry. Todd's knowledge of and respect for comedy shine through week after week and his ability to help actors see where their individual strengths lie is uncanny. The workshops are always affordable and consistently feature a who's who of CD's and other folks we should all know and be meeting with. If you are interested in growth as an actor and as a person then do yourself a favor and come to ACS</text>

<Text>I love Todd Rohrbacher. I love Elaine Hendrix. I've had the opportunity to learn from both of them through their own shared experiences and their knowledge of the industry. Their ability to coach comedy is so effective and so precise. I'm excited to know that I'm learning from actual pros. I've learned how to break down scenes quicker, make better and more interesting choices and how to use my unique voice in every scene. The Actors Comedy Studio is a really great community for actors, which is so important. On top of the classes ACS is offering Casting Director Workshops, which is cheaper than anywhere else in town - with the same popular CD's.
I'm inspired by the other actors in the class. I was surprised to see the dedication and talent that fills the room! Todd is so specific and is so spot-on and also really knows how to get the best performance out of every one. He digs and he challenges and encourages. He knows comedy, he IS comedy, and you'll learn soooo much from Todd all while having a blast!!</Text><user_name>Amber Marie Bollinger< /user_name><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

I cannot recommend the Acting For Sitcoms class at ACS ENOUGH. Todd has an unparalleled passion for and understanding of comedy. At the beginning of each class he gives a brief but always amusing update on the current events in the industry, knowing that as actors it is imperative we are kept informed and on our toes and therefore empowered when it comes to taking the reins in our careers and steering in the right direction. He knows what’s up and stays current.

Class is made up of actors from pretty diverse backgrounds, from actors who just want to loosen up and be more comfortable with comedy to stand-up comedians looking to branch out and get some solid technique for translating their personas to on-camera work. And every class, they all progress. You will see it. Each week is a chance to improve your cold-reading skills, audition technique, learn to nail taking direction, and watch your second take on playback at the end of the night.

The cost of class here is crazy low and as other people have mentioned ACS offers legit $20 casting director workshops and endless networking opportunities through its Facebook group and well, the other 15 or so working actors in class every night being encouraged to self-produce and just plain make-it-happen.

I’m only half-kidding when I say Todd is the Dumbledore of comedy. He can take any muggle struggling with finding the funny and with the right combination of spells turn them into a competent comedy wizard. Do yourself a favor, Accio your cellphone, conjure up an orientation meeting with Todd, and you’ll find your patronus has mysteriously changed to a whimsical, bespectacled little man charging down dementors while giggling and bellowing out, “Hello, everybody!”< /Text>

I've been going to ACS for the last  4 months and I love it!!!  I moved here from NY, and one of the things I quickly realized is how much sitcom comedy is valued in this town.  Todd's brilliance comes from his passion for comedy and specifically his love for sitcoms.  He breaks down sitcom comedy into a very actor-friendly approach.  I came from a 4 year theatre program in college, and found this to be a very useful segway into the world of tv comedy.  His 10 characters of comedy is brilliant, and very user friendly.  I'd highly recommend this class to anyone coming from a theatre program, improv background who wants to transition sitcom comedy, or anyone who wants to dive in and take some comedy classes.

One of the other very useful things I found about the studio is it's practical tools and networking opportunities.  Todd also offers private coaching, which I used multiple times during pilot season.  The studio also offers workshops with some awesome people like Dorian Frankel(CD for "Parks and Recreation", "The Office") and Scott David ("Criminal Minds") for very reasonable prices.  ACS is a great place to grow as an actor, but there are also awesome networking opportunities to segway you directly into the business.  Highly, highly recommmended!!</text>

< review>
This plaza has Trader Joe's, Marshalls, Kohl's, Chuck E Cheese, Round Table Pizza, Bed Bath and Beyond, Rubio's, Panda Express, Mimi's Cafe, Panera, Party City, and many other small shops and eateries. Only reason it got a 4 star is Toys R Us went out of business in this plaza! Bummer! The parking is crowded but doable.</review>

<Review>Well in this center you can find a Riteaid Pharmacy, a Dollar Tree store, a McDonald's, Bank of America and a Pizza hut, they have a big parking lot, then you won't have trouble to find space for your car in here.<//Review>< Resp>

Can't praise Land Park Dental enough.  The Dr is thorough, skilled, patient and efficient.  And I am the worst coward in the world when it comes to dentists.  Thank goodness for the gas. 😁  He explains everything!! Explains why I'm feeling the pain I am feeling, my options, plan of attack, priorities.   He takes all the time you need to make your decisions.  The office staff, front and back, are all super friendly and helpful.  Work with you to get you in when you need to be seen and help with financial situations.  They feel like friends, not just office staff.  Go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  I've been coming here for 2 or 3 years now on the referral from a friend.  So happy I did.  There are many reasons the office has been named "Best Dentist " several years.  You won't be disappointed.< /Text>

I have always been nervous going to the dentist but I’m glad I had a great experience here. I am a new patient and April who helped me out was super friendly and made me feel very comfortable. The office was small but didn’t bother me at all. The staff and doctor there was very very informative and definitely answered all the questions I had. I loved how the doctor walked me through every single tooth with a small camera showing me what needs work and what was going on with my teeth. I know I need a lot of work done and after my first visit I am confident that I can trust Land Park Dental to fix my smile.</review>

<Text>I have had nothing but exceptional care and service at this office for myself and children. My first visit was last week, and I was expecting the worst. The staff has been kind, courteous, gentle, and caring. I am normally terrified of the dentist, but everyone made me feel at ease the entire time especially with everything going on with COVID. In my first visit I had several follow up appointments and a plan explained to me in detail. Thank you to the entire team of essential workers. The Mercado family truly appreciates you.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>For years I avoided going to the dentist. I would wait until I was in excruciating pain...to the point where there was nothing left to do but to have my tooth removed. After having a few teeth removed...lol...my wife finally convinced me to try Dr. Mahal. I am so glad I did! He and his staff are great—Excellent customer service, professional, friendly and very accommodating to my dental needs.  I only wish we had discovered him before losing so many teeth!!<//Review>< pictures>

I love the customer service I receive from Dr. Mahal and his team...April (account services) and Lenka (the hygienist). They all provide excellent customer service!!

<Text>Land Park Dental has the sweetest staff that really cares about their patients. Dr. Mahal is very kind, patient, and takes his time to both listen and explain. It doesn’t hurt that he is totally adorable and has the most beautiful eyes, too 😏! The front desk gal was very thorough and pleasant. The hygienist Lynka  (sp?) remembered me from 8 months ago and made the task of teeth cleaning go by quickly and pleasantly. This is by far the BEST dental office I have ever been to.</Text>< Time>

Dr Mahal was AMAZING! He and his team took amazing care of my boyfriend both visits and we are excited to work with him more. He is so understanding and makes sure you are comfortable before every procedure. He's always been nervous about the dentis but this dentist and his team make every visit as quick and painless as possible. Thanks so much guys! Keep up the amazing work!< /Review>

Dr Mahal is amazing, I was in need of getting my wisdom tooth looked at because I was dealing with pain, He took me in a day after. After getting checked, turns out I had an infection and he took two of my wisdom teeth out. I felt no pain during the procedure. It was quick & painless. I was so amazed on how skillful this man is. I found my new dentist. Shoutout to April for helping me get started, such an amazing women with a big heart. Thank you Dr Mahal!! I highly recommend this dentist.</Text>

The staff is outstanding!  I have had several things go wrong with my dental insurance and they have stayed in touch and followed up consistently.   They have shown considerable empathy throughout the whole process. All of this is in addition to dentistry procedures that were very sensitive. As a newcomer to  Sacramento,  I am very pleased to have found Land Park Dental!

I usually don’t post reviews for any businesses, but I must admit this dental office has treated me very well for the last 3 years!
As most people know the dentist appointment is something you really don’t look forward to going anytime soon. Lol But I have had nothing but professional and positive treatment on every visit! The receptionist and dental assistant were very professional and courteous at all times, even through all my nervousness! 😬  Dr. Mahal treated me with kid gloves and was very informative about my dental condition (gum disease and future treatments) so I came away from my appointment feeling very confident that my future appointments will go well. Thank you to all the staff at Land Park Dental!🤗< /Review>

Dr. Mahal and the team are amazing! If you are looking for the best look no further. The staff is very personable and attentive making sure you are well taken care of.

Im not a big fan of the dentist but all i can say is Land Park Dental is good on my books. After a bad experience and expensive too i did not go back to my old dentist and was happy to find Dr. Mahal. They took care of me and there was little to no pain at all which will keep me coming back. I definitely recommend Land Park Dental and Dr. Mahal and his staff are very friendly!

Thank you Land Park Dental for the great work and hospitality! 😁<//text>

Let me just say this Dentist Office is super upbeat and professional. Sarah the office manager is amazing and full of life when presenting your treatment. Melissa the DA was so warm and friendly taking my x-rays took my anxieties away. Dr. Mahal is super cool and my favorite Dentist ever! They have same day crowns all Porcelain. Beautiful good vibes all the way around.<//Text>

Going to the dentist gives me Anxiety with a capital "A" This is small but VERY friendly staff. gives you a personal feel like you're the most important person of the day. They sensitive to your needs, Dr. Mahl answers all of your questions. Appointments are easy to schedule and the text/call reminders are Awesome.  If you're looking for a Dentist look no further go ahead and schedule an appointment. Tell 'em Lesah sent you.<//Review>

<text>I was scheduled for a filling I had been in 2 weeks earlier for a cleaning and some how, they schefuled me for another cleaning and filling. My time is important. They apologized for the mix up but mix ups here are the norm. Lots of staff changes and  DDS Mahal is or has a casual relationship we'd ith time. What should have taken at most 45 minutes took 1.75 minutes. He is also very non communicative with pts as to what hes doing which if you hate going to the DDS. Is very stressful.< /text>< UserId.>

<review>I came here in mid December as a first time client due to some pain in my upper gums/jaw. Come to find out a wisdom tooth was ready to be removed and I needed a crown put on a tooth I had grinded down terribly- both of which they identified immediately. After my first appointment I was very satisfied with the staffs approach to conversations of both my procedures. Not only is Dr.Narinder extremely honest, friendly and great at what he does, but his staff goes above and beyond to make sure you’re comfortable. Shout out to Melissa who helped me both times I was in, and is exceptionally personable and sweet. That’s much appreciated when you’re anxious about getting work done. Thanks to everyone especially Dr. Narinder‘s assistant (I wish I got her name!) who talked me through beforehand and made me laugh and forget I was about to have my tooth pulled! (And for telling me it’s okay to only eat ice cream and watch Netflix all day😂) I have never written a review for a mandatory appt I.e dentist/dr office but I feel I need to share my great experience in case a new guest feels hesitant like I did! Thank you to Dr. Narinder and his amazing staff!<//review><user_name>amy</user_name>< time>

Fast and efficient. Definitely one of the better boba places in the area. There's also one near blackhawk if you're in that area.< /Review>

I live in Tracy and get my Indian groceries in New India bazaar weekly. Whenever, I come there, it has become a custom for me to get a boba tea at happy lemon. Love the taste. 👌👍<//Review>

I have always loved happy lemon, but not this place. Service is bad. I always order chocolate milktea with puff cream for some reason it’s not available. I guess i shouldn’t come in 30 mins before closing.< /Text>

<Text>I swear, sometimes I wonder whether my girls really want tea and the softest, chewiest boba, or whether they want to visit this Happy Lemon because the owners are so amazing. The customer service makes this our fave place. There are iTea, T4, other happy lemon locations, and I would say that besides our other fave Boba Guys shop in San Ramon, this is our go to....Kathy and Samantha remembered our order the second time we visited, they start our drinks when we walk in, they know my kids and me by name, they make time to listen to my 8 year old’s puns, and to make eye contact with every customer,  and to really serve great tea and snacks with a smile. This is the east bay. There are
Tons of places to pick up tea and boba, but this is how you create a loyal following... come and visit. Start with the classic milk tea, they can customize sweetness and ice levels and then get creative... taro, earl grey, milk tea with salted cheese (so good!!), and the puff cream milk tea... only one of my brood likes boba, but she and I go to get our fix while the other two get their strawberry milkshakes... :) the parking lot is busy and can be a bit dangerous with blind spots. But it’s super convenient with pizza, a gas station with 7-11, Walmart marketplace, an Indian grocery, and our go to korean soup place all in the same complex. The only thing that would make it better is a location right in downtown...</Text><Date>1609274235424<//Date></record>

Great drinks. My favorite is the mango lemon 🍋  slushy with jelly especially on a hot day. It's the greatest drink to cool you off.<//review>

<Time>1601173715804<//Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>So, I went to this store  today to order matcha latte with tiramisu, one of the girl told me that your matcha has dairy,. I said it can’t be bc matcha is a non dairy & she even went on saying that she is a vegan that matcha has dairy on it. I told her I disagree but she insisted that happy lemon matcha contain dairy. It’s because I am Lactose intolerance I just want to switch the milk to soy or almond. If the owner is reading this please confirm that your matcha powder really contains dairy without even putting milk or cream on it? Thanks</Text>< pictures>

If you’d like to order a custom drink, using just the powder, please make that request and we can accommodate you. Also, please be advised that the tiramisu salted cheese in the drink you were trying to order also contains dairy.\n\nThanks for your input and let us know if you have any other concerns.'}< /Response>

I got a small black tea salted cheese drink with 50% sugar and shared it with my sister.  It had that wonderful Hong Kong milk tea taste with kind of a cheese cake taste at the finish.  The drink was beautifully presented.  The shop was clean with nice seating and comfortable, not cold, AC.  The service was warm and efficient.  I'm definitely coming back!  ^_^< /Review>

The staff is very nice, and the teas are great. There isn't a long wait time unless there is a lot of people or someone with a large order. I come here almost everyday (I'm kind of obsessed) and I love it.< /Text>

<Text>I'm a big fan of Happy Lemon. I was surprised I found one in Pleasanton. Customer service is good. Cleanliness is good. Lots of customers. It's a hot day today. I felt it wasn't cool enough inside but that could be b/c people were coming in and out, opening the door. I'm happy I found a Happy Lemon in Pleasanton.<//Text><rating>5</rating>< user_name>

It's a tea place where you can order different types of teas. The main focus is on lemon tea where you can get different blends.
I got a green tea with lemon juice and no sugar. It is somewhat better than drinking a national brand of tea with high fruitcose corn syrup, but the natural tea at Happy Lemon cost more and is healthier.
No word on whether they are going to serve food or snacks in the future.
Hopefully with all the tea places poping up in the Bay Area lately that this is not a fly by night fad.< /text>

Great drinks.

Awful service. The person behind the counter was extremely rude and unhelpful. My simple questions/request for suggestions on what to order were met with stares and unhelpful answers. When my kid wanted to keep and play with the order token even after we got our drinks, conveying this request was met with eye rolls and I think anger? I'm not usually one to hold people up for indifference in service, but this was particularly egregious. Being kind goes a long way and hope they train their staff to be accommodating.

The salted cheese is really good, though.</review>

The location is this Happy Lemon is a little peculiar, however it's not too hard to find.  And once you do find this, you'll enjoy their drinks just like any other locations.  Staff was great and drinks(I get the black tea salted cheese and my wife usual gets one of their lemon brewed drink) are consistently good.  I've been to this location twice so far.</Text>

Takes forever to open 99Ranch attachment, over a year now, NO FOOD just boba drinks, Tea is Tawainese style and overly bitter for oolong, breaking a continual trend of overbrewed not changed enough, let alone not taking out the leaves after initial brew.
The Taro snow tea, was great, au natural, no nsa or sugar free on the lemonades.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>One of my favorite places to dine! The authentic Colombian cuisine reminds me of my own abuelita's cooking. The food is fresh and always tasty. Service can be a little slow when it's busy, but they are always kind and helpful. The food in itself earns this place 5 stars for me. Would recommend time and time again.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Went here once. Food was good and tasty. I think it was very authentic, but I don’t feel like you got a lot for your money. I was still hungry after.< /Text>

<text>Came here on a Friday night with my guy and we we're seated right away.  Quiet little spot tucked away in a shopping center. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive. The sangria messed me up-very tasty and the food was FANTASTIC. 100% authentic Columbian fare-best I've had since leaving my hometown in NYC.  If I could just find a good slice of pizza around here I'd be all set.</text>< Rating>

<Review>I know NOTHING about Columbian food. I was forced to go here by my wife and two other couples. I don't know what I ate but it was great! The service was top notch. The coffee was superb. I will definitely eat here again. That's saying a lot because I am VERY picky.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Best Colombian food I've had in Orange County. Bandeja Paisa is amazing every time! Also, the aborrajado is great for a dessert!
Besides the food, the service is always very good. Everyone is friendly and attentive. I'll definitely keep coming back.<//review>

Authentic Colombian food. Plates are really big and delicious and it's a very good value. Service is good as well. Bandeja paisa is a must but they also serve a wide variety of their local comfort food, typical dishes as well as arepas. The vibe is a normal casual restaurant. They sometimes have live music on weekends!
Definitely worth trying!< /review>

<Review>Great Colombian food, some of rhe best I have tasted in the US.  "Arepas de chocolo" and the "cazuela" were great choices.  Dessert was very difficult to pick (to many great options) but both the "postre de natas" and "brevas con arequipe" let us thinking in the next time we will come back.</Review>< Pictures>

Great and reliable place. Been coming here for more than 4years and always have a good experience. Finally decided to write a review because this is the second time they help me out, when they could have take advantage like other mechanics would. This time took mike 99chevy because it was having some small issues and I really couldn’t figure it out. So I took it to Fred’s and they told me it was a small wire... and at no charge!
This what makes them a great place of service, because I know they could had said it was something else and they could have also charge me for just checking my truck like every other mechanic. I really appreciate their honesty. And hope they never change. Will be hopefully a customer for many more years. Thank you 🙏</text>

This is an awesome mechanic shop, honest good guys. If you need good work done from good Christian people these guys are it. They went above and beyond everything I asked them to do. I will not only get most of my work done to my vehicles with Fred's. I recommend them to everyone I know.<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Pics>None</Pics><Text>Brought our van into Fred’s because it was making a noise. I said it sounded like the brakes. They said it was the transmission. They rebuilt the transmission and when we got it back, the car was still making the noise. Took it back and Fred’s said it was the brakes. They fixed the brakes and refunded the transmission cost. Next day, the transmission starts slipping. Brought it back and they “adjusted” it. Fast forward a couple of months. Driving down the freeway and transmission fluid starts pouring out of the dipstick. Now I need to go pay for someone to fix my transmission that was working fine in the first place.< /Text><Name>John Hochadel<//Name>< Date>

<response>None</response><Text>This was most far the "WORST" Experience I've ever deal with from a auto shop. Thought I could put my trust in these guys to fix my car right and get what I was paying for. Didn't happen at all!!!!
They were suppose to replace my radiator with a brand new one, which it was used, but still had nerve to over charge. Had them changed my oil, and they didn't even do it, but charged me anyways. Then they had nerve to charge me for coolant but didn't even put coolant in my Reserve bottle. I'm very disappointed especially as a single women with two kid's, who works hard, and goes to school. It's just another place taking advantage of people especially women because they assume we don't know any better.
Spent over 600.00 dollars here and for What? To have someone else fix what wasn't done right. I never wrote a review for any place in my life, and this was far the most corrupted place. It's so sad that we have evil people in this world. Won't ever be returning here. & good luck to those who do!<//Text>< user>

I came to Whittier from San Diego... as we were driving, right front tire lost two nuts and about to fall off. My BF took my car in to Fred's. He was really happy with their prompt service and the price was very good. Will definitely go to him as needed when I am in town.<//Text>

I went in to this place because something was leaking supposedly it was coolant. My car was there for 2 days and during those 2 days the engine light went on and gave a code(which it hasn't done to my car in 2 years) then all of a sudden my engine is cracked. They said to fix it I would need to get a new motor. They ended up only charging me for parts which was suspicious. When I finally took my car home the few miles to get there my car smelled like something was burning inside. It never used to smell like that. 0 stars. Instead of fixing my car made it worse. I can't believe auto shops like this exist. Oh and the number is incorrect on yelp. Might want to check yelp people scary reviews there similar to mine. -_- Beyond Annoyed.<//review>

<gmapID>0x80c2d35a8fdec52d:0x749b2b4eb91e2607< /gmapID><Review>These are what Fred's is "famous" for.

I decided to try Fred's based on not one, but multiple (isolated) mentions and raves of people telling of his trustworthiness (integrity/honesty) quality, and speed. The raves and recommendations, were from church going Christians, and not.

At Fred's, it is very common to receive an estimate of what the repair price could be, only to receive a call (on the same day) to find out that the cost would be a mere fraction of the original estimate, after all!

If they find something inexpensive was causing the problem, like a loose wire etc, they let you know!

We'll, I can say that I have taken my car to Fred's a couple of times now and have had the same repeated experiences: Receiving a friendly call (same day, while at work) to inform me that my car is fixed and ready to go, with a "the problem was minor after all" report.

Before Fred's, I feared and hated having to take my vehicle to a shop because of past personal and shared experiences opposite to what you experience at Fred's. I've been to and have heard stories of going to other mechanics and getting charged for work that wasn't needed based on either higher initial estimates or having the mechanic "discover" a much costlier fix once you are gone and they've have time to "discover" what the problem is.

Thank you, and kudos to Fred and his men!!!
(he apparently hires mechanics of the same ethos)

P.s.
It turns out, Fred is a pastor where he attends church every week, for many years now.< /Review><name>Robert Rubio</name>< Rate>

<gmap_id>0x80c2d35a8fdec52d:0x749b2b4eb91e2607<//gmap_id><review>My wife took her 2013 Honda Accord V6 to Fred's Automotive for an oil change in June 2013.  I took her car there for another oil change in early 2014.  While I was there, I noticed from their oil change reminder sticker on the windshield that they had replaced the oil with 5w20 oil.  This car uses 0w20, which only comes in synthetic blend or full synthetic motor oil. I asked them if they used conventional oil in the car and they said yes.  I told them that the recommended oil for this car, per the manufacturer, was 0w20, a synthetic oil.  They tried to convince me that 1) the manufacturer also recommended 5w20, 2) it was written right on the oil fill cap, and 3) 0w20 also comes in conventional, making it okay to use 5w20 conventional oil.  I told them to go check it again, and showed them on Google that 0w20 ONLY comes in full synthetic/synthetic blend.   I asked them if they switched back and forth from synthetic oil and conventional oil in their own cars, and I got a blank stare.  They checked the oil fill cap, which says to only use 0w20 (duh).  They then said that since they didn't carry 0w20 synthetic oil, that if I bought the oil, they would do the oil change for free.  I told them I'd think about it, and left and never returned.  I ended up doing the oil change myself, with the correct oil and an hour of my time.

I'm not an ASE technician, but even I know you're not supposed to use conventional oil in an engine designed for synthetic, much less switch back and forth between the two. The oil change interval on the Accord is 7000 miles, which is fine if it had been running on synthetic.  But the standard life of the 5w20 conventional oil is 5000 miles.  So, I have been running on oil 2000 miles past its recomended life.  I doubt there's permanent damage, but if a place can't bother with something as simple as read the oil fill cap and Google "oil for 2013 honda accord", how can I trust them to do it right the second time?  That was just pure laziness (or worse, incompetence) on their part.< /review><user_id>117627906912370026098</user_id><Rating>1< /Rating>< pictures>

Terrible service! Maybe because tax season is coming around they feel the need to mess up their cars. The mechanics all have different stories on whats wrong with your car. Don't come here! WARNING!<//text>

I recently had a visit with them for my cat. She had a slight limp on her paw. They did xray and prescribed Metacam to take home, which I was to administer orally. Well apparently the FDA has a warning that it shouldn't be administered to cats. I wish I would have known that beforehand because she passed away. I am extremely distraught from what happened. She was a young cat under 3 years. Warning for all cat people, please bring your cats elsewhere. RIP too my poor cat.</Text>

My cat had broke her arm once and the vet took great care of her with ease. I'm always happy with service, I recommend this vet clinic.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Ďŕ Kumar is so so caring and has the best bedside manners, it may not be a high-tech office but it absolutely makes up in there skill, ability and how nice his front and back office staff are! Dr. Kumar really cares about animal rescue to which is so wonderful to hear and it's nice to be supported as he knows that both myself and my friends I've been doing rescue for a long time and this place is so great!!</Text>

<review>I took my puppy chow chow here because he was looking very sick. I brought him here and let me say it was the best choice! My puppy was treated very well, he had to stay for the day to get treated for his illness and when I picked him up I noticed he was already looking better. I was given a bag of medications and care instructions for my pup! The next day he was jumping and wanting to play like before! Thank you Southern California Animal Hospital! You guys are the BEST!< /review>< rate>

{'time': 1595709636783, 'text': 'Thank you for your review. When your pet first came in, the\ninitial symptoms that were given by you were decreased\nappetite, excessive itchiness on rear area, and scooting. Dr.\nalways takes his time to do the exam and is very thorough in\nwhat he does. Based on Dr.’s exam and the symptoms present,\none of our technicians went over an estimate with you. While\ngoing over the estimate, the technician explained why each test\nand treatment was needed. You signed the estimate and gave us\nyour card to run through, giving us permission to get started. In\nthe estimate, we informed you that Dr. recommended to do skin\ntesting if your dog was not doing better. You talked to your\ndaughter AFTER signing the estimate and then decided to not do\ntreatment. By that point we had already started treatment, since\nyou signed off on the estimate and gave us your card to run. Our\ntechnician then went outside to explain that you are required to\npay for the treatment that was already done. Two tests that Dr.\nrecommended were blood-work and a fecal test because of the\nhistory that was presented to us. The blood test was\nrecommended to find out why your dog had a decreased\nappetite, as this is crucial to your dog’s health and well-being.\nThe fecal exam was recommended to make sure your dog did\nnot have any parasites, which could be the cause of the\nexcessive itchiness on the rear and scooting. Since you ended up\ndeclining all of the testing that was initially approved, we were\nunable to give you a clear diagnosis without the tests. Here at\nSouthern California Animal Hospital, we are willing to discuss\nprices and reasons as to why testing is recommended. If you felt\nthat the price was too high, you could have expressed your\nconcerns or declined what was offered to you as opposed to\nsigning to approve the estimate. We apologize that you don’t\nhave a clear ailment for your dog, but that is because your\ndaughter wanted to stop all testing and take the dog home. In\norder to give you a clear diagnosis and prognosis on your dog,\ntest are required.'}< /Response>

Normally we do not give any quotes over the phone due to each animal being different. For safety reasons, we require an exam first before we do any type of treatment. For spays and neuters it is slightly different. We can give an estimate, but that can change depending on what the owner approves or declines.

As a rescue owner for German shepherds I can not say more then they are excellent . Clear communication , perfect vetting and very nice staff to deal with . We had several very aggressive dogs and they never said no while so many other vets denied us . We are extremely grateful for all what they did for our rescue group .</text>

My dog is the sweetest big German Sheppard, but a little neurotic on a leash. The staff loves her and they answer my questions and provide good vet care. The pick up is slow so plan to wait at least 30 minutes to pick up your pet. That's the only reason for the 1 star demark. I left her all day for a lime dip and they didn't have the meds ready when I came to pick her up. Other than that I'm happy with my dog's vet plan and service!</Review>

Friendly staff who sympathized with us as we visited them to put our dog to sleep. He was 15yrs old and had many health issues. They made the process a little easier and gave us time to be with him before and after the process without rushing us to leave. Compared to other places for the services we got it was affordable.< /Text>

<text>I am giving it a three only because before this visit I really like this place, I have brought my pets for vaccinations and to be fixed. But today’s visit was not like the other visits, staff one girl in particular wasn’t understanding at all, claimed my cat was hostil, I didn’t see what went on when she took him in the back room to give him his vaccinations but had they asked how my cat was handled the last time he got shots or even asked about his personality or called on me for help they would have gotten a different outcome instead I have a scared kitty who pooped in his carrier due to being so scared. And she proceeded to tell me next time he will have to be tranquilized before shots!!! Nope not happening, not going back there again!!< /text><GmapID>0x80c2d6f554de48b5:0x4feae8d5644f4d65</GmapID>< userid>

After waiting in the reception area for 1 1/2 hours. I wasn't even acknowledged I left to another pet hospital close by. She was put out of the misery finally within 15 minutes of walking in. Don't go here with your pet unless you have a deep pocket. This office does not put what's best for your pet FIRST.

They always treat my pets with care. However, the last time I went in and brought my pet I was disappointed. I brought my dog in and told them she had a swollen eye due to something that might be stuck in her eye. They evaluated my dog (temperature, weight, etc.) and took her to the back. They told me it would take about 2 hours to treat her and that they will see what they find in her eye. With medicine and treatments, they quoted me at approx. $300. They called me about 2.5 hours later and told me my pet was being relentless and that she might need to have a higher dosage of anesthesia so that she can calm down and that way they can take a look in her eye more thoroughly. They told me the cost would go from $300 to $550! Yikes. Long story short, I payed what they have already done on my dog, took the medication and found a different animal hospital in the area. They charged me a remarkably lower amount to further her treatment in the new animal hospital. Not to mention, they found the foxtail she had stuck in her eye in about 10 minutes!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<response>{'time': 1551567812028, 'text': 'Thank you for your review and we understand fully your concerns. When you came in on Thursday\n2/28/2019 with Baby you addressed to us that you were given a copy of an estimate that was given to\nyou for treatment April 27, 2018 under ASPCA, we did inform you that since we haven’t seen Baby in a\nyear we would have to do an exam prior to any testing’s that you requested. We also informed you that\nthe estimate you are referring to was under the ASPCA account and not your own and any pricing on\ntheir reflects what we give to our rescue organizations, ASPCA issued you a voucher last year in April and\nevery voucher they issue is for single issue only it’s not a reoccurring coverage and when you called\nASPCA this Thursday they also informed you of this and they told you unfortunately they wouldn’t be\nable to assist further with treatments, you handed your phone over to one of our staff members who\nspoke with the ASPCA representative you were speaking to and she was able to confirm what the rep\nhad already told you regarding your options but with the health of your pet declining we did offer you\nto do an exam but under your own account with our regular client prices and you declined. You had\noptions offered and we did our best to resolve your concerns with Baby but there’s only so much we can\ndo if you decline any services. We understand that you have financial difficulties and we do our best to\ncater to low income clients by referring them to organizations that can help and ASPCA did help you in\nApril 2018 they covered exam, treatment, testing and medications for Baby but unfortunately her health\nis declining and they understood that you felt she is suffering, ASPCA offered a secondary option but\nagain even after you were offered multiple choices to help Baby you declined any services.\n\nWe are sorry that you felt your experience here wasn’t satisfactory but do keep in mind we did our best\nto help you for the wellness of Baby.\n\nThank You\n-SCAH'}<//response>< Pics>

<Text>Gave me a price quotes for my last visit. When I came back for more services they said the prices I was given were invalid. I'm low income so they wasted my time with there poor communication. Were gonna charge me more than what they said before. They said the offer expired but it didn't say that on the paper so how was I supposed to know? Just very poor service for my situation. And my poor dog is suffering.< /Text><Rate>1< /Rate>< user_id>

The employees here always work hard and care for the animals.  Most importantly the doctor appears to be very sincere and caring and he wouldn't recommend something unless absolutely necessary for your pets well being.  He is high in demand and he is always busy and that is a good sign to me, I just wish he would first bring another veterinarian to handle the load and second redecorate the office to a little more contemporary appearance, Neither of which has anything to do with the quality of the care that your pet receives here.<//Text>

Everybody is wonderful there and and the doctor takes his time with your loved one pet. I've been taking my Brucie there for 7 years and never had a problem. My Brucie was very sick when he was a puppy and with the good care here he is still with us and healthy. God bless<//Text>

I was skeptical at first and I'll admit I didn't have a first good visit considering I was left to wait 9 hours for a simple X-ray and it's completely understandable since they accidentally overbooked appointments. But all in all I appreciate the workers and I'm usually in and out in about an hour.</review>

<review>Every time we had to take our dogs there the staff was incredibly nice and extremely knowledgeable... they always called our dogs by their names. They never overcharged us for vaccinations and even when we had to do a very risky neutering for our Whippet... they knew the exact treatments that would be safe for a sighthound. I hate that we are so far away now and wish we could find an honest, knowledgeable, and friendly staff like Southern California Animal Hospital. If you live close consider yourselves lucky... it's a little in the boondocks but it's worth it to make the trip.</review></record>

As well as having my very own dog, I do a lot of personal rescue. No I am not a large or funded rescue group. I choose to do dog rescue because it needs to be done. Dr. Kumar and his staff are 5 star plus. This is not a place where it's just about $$$$$$$$$. This is truly a dedicated Doctor, and he has obviously trained his staff with the same mentality. Dr, Kumar is owed a tremendous debt of gratitude for the tremendous work he does for the many rescued animals he treats. He is truly a very talented physician as well as a philanthropic man.< /text>

< Review>
Dr. Kumar and his staff are amazing! They showed so much empathy when I had to put down one of my dogs of 15 years. The staff was extremely comforting and Dr. Kumar was honest about my dog's prognosis and what would be best for her circumstances. Never did he give me any false hopes and was supportive with my difficult decision. I now have a 5 month old Boxer named Hazel whom is recognized by all the staff there. She's always getting into some sort of trouble from the kennel cough, to allergies, and most recently a accident where she was struck by a truck. The people at this place are like family to me and my new puppy. I love how they all interact with my dog and always pay extra attention to making animals and owners feel at ease with the best care possible. I recommend this place to anyone who has pets. Thank you guys for doing what you love and making my life so much easier in caring for my puppy!<//Review>

<user_id>111969196160571569748<//user_id><text>Dr. Kumar has been the only Vet to see my animals...birds, cats, dogs all of them! Over a 30 yr span of treatment for everything from  simple infections,major surgery, and routine visits and vaccinations.
I was recently there with my white beautiful boxer that he'd treated since 7 months old...she was now 11 and we had to send Maddie "off to college" (RIP), and he allowed me to do it completely on my terms, I sat on the floor and he allowed me to cradle her and he kneeled next to me and did his job. And told me I could take all the time I needed and left. He didnt think about the usage of the exam room or how much it might affect his day...thank you Dr. Kumar. Acts of kindness are key.<//text>< gmap_id>

<Text>I have brought two of my dogs here for urgent care type of stuff. One of them needed surgery and the other was just a drama king and needed some pain meds to ease his little episode. The doctor and staff are so incredibly helpful and friendly. I'm certainly glad they were open that fateful Sunday morning. With that, I'll always bring my pups here as they treat them like the family members they are.

Thank you for all your helpful services and tender care. Very happy to have you as apart of our lives.< /Text><rating>5<//rating>< Pictures>

Normally have to wait 40 minutes after appointment time before they see my dog. Left my dog there at the pet hotel and when we picked her up she was covered in pee. But that was only once and they're good at sending reminders for vaccinations and if you goo during their clinic hours it's half the price< /Text>

Love Dr. Kumar and his staff, so sweet, I take all my dog's there, and my rescue's too, Ivan is the best, he should be a Vet he is the nicest and so professional, all the staff is.  I just cant say enough of this place.  I totaly trust Dr. Kumar with my babies. There is a smell that isnt very pleasant but that's because I guess it's kinda outdated but other than that, I really feel comfortable going there.<//text>

<text>I am speechless!  So Thankful that there are people that genuinely care for the well being of our pets.  My babies (pitbulls) had major surgeries, the staff were exceptionally professional and caring. Ive been to many other pet hospitals but this one here is absolutely the BEST of all.
Thank you, Thank you a million to Dr. Kumar, Britney,Nef and Ivan for all your help and attentiveness.  I'll Make sure I let my my friends know about this great place.
CANT THANK YOU GUYS ENOUGH.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2d6f554de48b5:0x4feae8d5644f4d65<//Gmap_id>< pictures>

I brought my dog here after he got hit by a car last year and was taken care of immediately. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Since then I've taken my dog there for about three more times for check ups and I'm extreamely satusfied after every visit.<//Text>

I am a strict animal rescue and I require only the best for my pets I rescue. I have used several vets in CA, (not by choice) and I would highly recommend Dr. Kumar and his team.  They are by far the best. Dr. Kumar doesn't believe you should give up on a pet, that if that pet is willing to fight for it's life you should fight also. Many vets first word out of their mouths are euthanize for a critical situation, not Dr. Kumar, and that is what I love about him. I am based out of Rhode Island but I have met Dr. Kumar and his team several times, I even call him for advice on my own personal pets I have here with me in RI, I value his opinion over my vets here any day.  Dr. Kumar has been my CA vet now for almost 2 years and every fur-baby I rescue goes to him and are boarded with him until I am able to drive to CA to get my rescued babies. If I could give him 10 stars I would but only allows 5....lol! Great Team At Southern California Animal Hospital. Love you guys! <3< /text>

I absolutely love the LA fashion district. There's so much to see and do so much more than just fashion. Be sure to check out that California flower Mall, all the food and drink places And there's a lot of public art and beauty perfect photo shoots. There's a lot of security and police presents so it's very safe. Lots of parking garages everywhere. You don't have to have a business license to shop. Great place to spend the day.< /Review>

Buy something or don't, he will still leave a lasting impression that will make you want to go back and buy a few of his suits.

<Text>A nice and perfect place to buy clothes that you want, this place is very accessible and convenient. You can find different kinds of garments here because there are plenty of vendors who are selling different style of clothing, if you're looking for colorful clothes they are easy to find, or if you want simple attire like black and white they are available as well. I really enjoyed my shopping here and I guess I will come back more often to buy my own clothes or even for someone else.<//Text>< rate>

I love fashion and hope to one day be a successful fashion designer so I really did like it there. There are so many fabric shops that it would take hours to shop through all of them. I am just saddened by how run-down the district is. :(<//Text>

Come to the alley on a Saturday morning and bring cash.  The wholesale stores will do sidewalk sales and sell tops and dresses for $5, $8.  It gets very crowded but you can get a lot of awesome stuff and street food.< /review>

The guys really worked hard shuffling cars to get you out but it was a bit unfair when a caucasian man and his wife walked up and demanded they get his car right away and everyone else who have been waiting their turn had to wait for them to service him. I was there for 30 minutes waiting for my car and expressed that but they had to get his immediately. Just unfair.</Text>< Pics>

Worst place in Los Angeles. It is so much crowded and unsafe to go alone. People who needs to buy in wholesale can choose this place for fabrics. I really can't see the roads so untidy and it's almost like walking in dark.</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It seems to have reproduced the Dongdaemoon Peace Market in Los Angeles in the 2000s. The same goes for the clothes that sell. If it is attractive, it is attractive.

(Translated by Google) There is a great supply of dresses and ball gowns; plus inexpensive bazaar items.
Other than that, it is a waste of small businesses that sell retail or wholesale.

What is "fashion" little or nothing, really.

(Original)
Hay mucha oferta de vestidos y trajes de gala; además de artículos de bazar de bajo coste.
Aparte de eso, es una malgama de pequeños comercios que venden al por menor o por mayor.

Lo que es "moda" poco o nada, la verdad.<//Text>

<review>Good selection of wines in all price ranges. Most of these bottles are not available at grocery stores. Sometimes they bring in bottles from small producers at a great price. I've noticed a bit of decline in service. Staff used to be more friendly. Might be a covid thing where the afternoon staff member is a little less interested now< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>A sophisticated and fashionable wine shop. Last Tuesday, I went to this wine store. The wines in this store piqued my interest. It was truly impressive. The flavour of their wine was divine. The red wine, in particular, had a bitter-sweet flavor and a wonderful aroma. I'm sure I'll return to this shop. A lovely wine shop.</review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

The staff was great and did a wonderful job explaining each wine. The wine that I bought from this shop was top-notch. The apple cider mix was magnificent.   I love this wine shop because they had a great collection of wines. The place was so relaxing and cozy.  I will surely visit this shop again.!!</Review>

They deserve wonderful scores! This was an excellent location for a wine store. My family has wanted to try to taste their fine wines. I was told they had to come back, because it was a nice one. We love this place truly, from the back to the edge. The level of service they delivered was immense. A faithful customer here!</Review>

<review>William provides great entertainment and a lot of good wine. My sisters, nieces, and I stopped into his shop today, and we enjoyed ourselves. We tasted at least 10 Chianti Classico, as well as several other varieties, three dessert wines, three balsamic kinds of vinegar, and truffle and olive oil chocolate. I highly recommend this wine shop!</review>< Pictures>

Late in the night, my friends and I had drinks here to unwind and relax. We were greeted happily by William, our server. He was funny and very welcoming. We had some fine wines, really. But, we enjoyed William's service. From various angles, he took a lot of pictures of our party. We had a nice time all in all!< /Review>

This wine shop has a lot of different wines to choose from. From white wine, which is my choice, to champagne and red wine, too. You could even sample their very own wine, which had been put in a barrel. Apart from the wines, they even had beers that you could try. The location was also so soothing and elegant. I can't wait for this wine shop to stop by again.< /review>

The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable about the enormous variety. She helped me choose the perfect wine for me. I like this shop's setup. It was so relaxing and cozy. The racks of wine were all organized. This is the best store I've ever been to for liquor. It has the impression of a very high-end wine store, but the prices are much more reasonable.< /review>

<Review>This is the only place provides a personal and dynamic service. They assist their clients by way of chat, call or email. They take care of all clients' drinking and gift-giving needs, may it be private or corporate clients.

Their position was both secure and elegant. On their menu, the food was delicious and savory. We had steak the last time we were here, and it was delicious and the best we've ever had! Aside from their extensive wine and beer selection, they also offer lunch and dinner menus.</Text>

<text>We stopped in for a wine tasting to see if we enjoyed any. Sophia helped us pick what we liked and educated us on the difference in the types of wine and how they were made. We ended up buying three bottles and got complimentary wine glasses! Sophia was very knowledgeable and helpful. I strongly recommend them!</text>< pics>

<text>I'm part of a wine shop that enables you to carry your food while enjoying your favorite beverage. So, since there are many restaurants within walking distance, this spot ranks as one of my favorites. Nice workers and truly wonderful customers and the staff here are one of the kindest and most social people I've ever met! This is your spot if you want to be with people who enjoy wine.</text>< pics>

The owner is genuine and very humble but also incredibly knowledgeable about the local products. We would recommend a visit to this wine shop as it is a great way to learn about the area. Plus, you get the opportunity to taste and buy if you would like some wonderful wines and local products.< /Text>

Since they started their company, I have been buying their wine. They were more expensive than any other wine shop in the region. They had the finest service as well. Their workers were also very educated about wine and beer. I hope they'll stay longer because they've got the best tastings and the toughest wines to find in the region.<//Text>

We went to all the wineries, and we enjoyed all of them, but our two favorites were the blueberry and blackberry in this wine store! Just like their wines, Bailey is so helpful and sweet! He has described the wines perfectly as well. We'll be back again next time we're in town and recommend them to all my friends.< /text>

My friends and I had a nice time yesterday at this wine store. This is a chilling place to hang out if you're a lover of liquor or wines like me. Many of the wines shown are all imported and are reasonably priced. Well, for you, this is the place! A very good environment for just dining, drinking and chatting to your friends. Highly advised!</review>

< review>
This wine shop has it all for you if you need a great wine.  It took me far too long to find this place in the neighborhood,  but I am glad I did. This wine shop is a hidden gem in this town.  If you run out of wine you can buy a bottle of wine in this shop and chill. The staves were so friendly and surely will help you out. Highly recommended!< /review>

Excellent wine shop! The proprietor is exceptionally helpful and very knowledgable. All in our group bought wines at a variety of price points and I can't wait to sample them. They have a superb selection of wines. We will definitely visit this place again. This is a great place for you to choose which wine flavor do you want to taste.<//Text>

I went to this wine shop yesterday Morning. The server was well versed regarding the menu and wine list. I was happy to see he had at least one of the best red wine from the other country. It went well with my meal, and the seafood dinner was superb too. I highly recommend this place to everyone I know!< /Review>

I will rate this wine shop a five-star because of its amazing selections of wine. The staff here are very friendly and knowledgeable about their work. They truly have a wide selection of wines, and I'm happy because everything that I needed was here. I could not ask for more about the service from these guys because it was certainly amazing. Thank you so much! Keep it up!</Text>

<review>This is the best wine shop in the city! They had all the wines and beers, too. I bought my dad's favorite Chardonnay and Pinot Noir here. They were much cheaper than any wine shop we've been to. They also serve menus for brunch and dinner. They had pastries and bread, too. I love the smell of the place.</review>< pictures>

We decided to try the wine tasting event that they have. You get three generous samples of the wines they are highlighting. The people come around to your table and serve and explain each wine. We also ordered food from the menu. Everything was delicious that we tried. I would revisit and recommend this wine shop to my colleagues.<//Text>

They have fabulous staff! If you are a wine drinker then you must try! I booked the venue for my sister's bridal shower, which included afternoon tea, canapes and plenty of great alcoholic beverages. I honestly cannot criticize this place at all. Everything from the venue to the staff, to the food, and drink was absolutely wonderful!<//review>

This wine shop provides the different category of wine, which one is my favorite is Casanova di Neri Brunello di Montalcino Effusive aromas and flavors of raspberry, cherry, floral, mineral and tobacco are at the centre of this linear, vibrant red.<//review><Time>1607697399798</Time></record>

If you consider yourself to be a gourmand of wines then you definitely have to come and check this place. Here, you can find different wines such as Chardonnay, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Very good selection of natural wines. The staff members who worked here are very welcoming and will show and let you try the wine as well.</Text>

A great wine shop that has a huge collection of wines. Every weekend they have a free tasting of their own produce wine. The staves were very welcoming and friendly. They will surely help you in choosing a great wine. I love the place because it has a calm ambiance. The wine that I bought from here tastes so good.< /text>

I hadn't been there in five years and it remains a small shop compare to the behemoths. They have relatively few Spanish wines. Use your GPS because it is in a small "industrial" park. Parking is good.< /Review>< Pictures>

These guys are incredible.  Every time I am in LA, I head to their store/warehouse.  I given my target price on a per bottle basis.  I tell them my preferences.  (Which happen to be any reds from light to medium to full bodied).  They pick out the bottles for me.  I trust them absolutely.  I get the bottles shipped to my address in Miami.  The bottles arrive.  And every one of the 12 bottles are incredible.  These guys are a class act.  First class service.  Knowledgeable.  Understand and address your needs perfectly.  I wish they could ship to Canada where I live full-time because it's hard to get wine this good at all price levels at their great prices.< /Review>

<review>Great wines at great prices.

This place is excellent for all sorts of wines, from everyday wines under $8 to multi-hundred dollar wines for that very special occasion. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  Just tell them what you are looking for -- style, meal, whatever -- along with a price range and they will give you an excellent recommendation.  You cannot go wrong purchasing your wine here.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1483062922012, 'text': 'Very kind of you.

What an absolute nice surprise on the outskirts of downtown LA!  The wine was decent and I also enjoyed a small canola with a iambic beer from the case.  Cool place to relax and enjoy a drink.  Next time I want to try out the restaurant in the back.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Everything is good. Every single wine. The selection here isn't as broad as many wine stores, but the quality... Well, except the Sophia, that stuff's nasty. The staff will help you find a wine you like, with selections from all over California, Spain, Italy and France. If you see something you like, buy a bunch, as they tend to rotate stock pretty quickly. Small selection of glassware and tools, too, at good prices. Remember, just wine, so you'll need to get your beer and liquor somewhere else.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

They know their stuff here. Ask the staff for help, because while their inventory rotates fairly quickly, there's always excellent wines, and if you tell them what you like, they're more than happy to help. The prices are also very reasonable.</text>

Friendly service (and I'm usually shopping at the lower end of the price range). Later, when I'm home drinking the wine, I usually think mmm good wine, great value.< /Text>

Great pricing generally and high turnover of stock so lots of new stuff comes in often. Also good about giving you the sealed OC or OWC if it comes in that packaging and you're ordering in the appropriate quantity (case or half case depending on packaging).<//text>< Pictures>

Very organized, clean, and pleasant staff.  Attended a volleyball tournament here for the 1st time and was surprised how easy it was to park, find the entrance, and lots of areas to sit/eat, meet with team both inside and outisde the complex.<//Text>

The sports complex has 21 basketball courts at max capacity for tournament play. They have a huge snack bar, that's not too pricey, as well a a sporting good store (that was closed after our game). The bathrooms were nice, but could stand to be cleaned more often.</Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>This is a very large sports center that hosts a variety of sports including: volleyball, indoor soccer, gymnastics, and basketball.  There is a cafeteria with lots of seating, food is pretty good for being a sports facility, you are going to pay a little more for convenience, variety of beverages including sports drinks, sodas and beer.  They do sports conditioning as well.< /Review>< pictures>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Huge amount of unused courts, yet won’t let kids just shoot around for an hour without paying $70 per hour.
Took my kids there because no one answers the phone. No staff available to answer questions. No one at the front desk. The doors were open and there were like 6-8 open courts with no one playing on them. It was a rainy day so I took 3 kids there to just shoot around to get ready for a tournament they have coming up and got kicked out by the janitor. Just wanted to let the kids shoot around for an hour since they couldn’t go to the park due to rain and they wouldn’t let us.
Where is the love for the athletes and the game?</text>< pics>

We come here for AAA Sports Club Volleyball.  This facility is amazing, and my kids love training here.  Also, I like that there's a restaurant area, I get snacks and bring my laptop to do some work during my kids' classes.  It's a very convenient setup for us, good place.< /Review>

My daughter practiced here one day as a guest for AAA Sports, and we were so impressed with the facility.  I hadn't eaten dinner yet and didn't know there would be a restaurant which was a great surprise.  Also, glad to know this place was here, great place to enroll for summer camps I think!</Review>

<Review>It’s a nice facility but charging $15 for parking and blocking off all other free parking for miles is not right... Also, snack bar is over the top expensive really taking advantage of people who are trapped as even when you pay for parking they don’t allow u to re-enter.  Whoever is making these decisions needs to evaluate how this is perceived as I hear many people complaining.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_name>

It's so hot inside. It should be illegal to play when it's that hot. 90 degrees outside,  110 degrees inside with hundreds of people. You can hide out in the restaurant area with some ac, but poor players. They could have hot yoga classes. The courts are ok, but the spectator seating is only on the ends...makes it difficult to get the game footage you want.<//review>

<Review>I have a very bad experience with this guys.
My daughter plays in this place for about 4 months. Her mentor is Miss Jillian. She is very careless of the kids & she isn’t a professional person in her job. This lady makes a big difference between the kids. We talked several times to Mike (her boss) about this problem but he doesn’t care.< /Review>< userid>

This place is great! It's huge over 20 full size basketball courts. My AAU club team competes in basketball tournaments here. It has a small weight lifting area in the back with a small size restaurant inside.< /Text>

<text>I attend Momentous for volleyball tournaments. I will start off with what I dislike about this place. We bought a drink. Asked for a refill and there was a charge (which ok, is understandable). But instead asked for just ice and was told that's $1.00. For the ice.... The food prices are rather high. A slice of pizza is $5.00. That's almost a whole pizza at some places. Adults are $8.00, Military and Seniors are $7. Kids under 12 are free. Other than that the facility is good. There's tables and chairs outside the courts but you need to get there early to grab one. I can say that they keep the bathroom cleaned and stocked. There was an attendant in there every time I went. I do like this facility over some other ones though.<//text>< Pics>

They’ll take your right arm for parking and then your left leg for a little bit to eat. It’s also about 200 decibels in there, hard for players and coaches to communicate, hard to talk to the person right next to you. The courts are well maintained and that’s about all they’ve got going for them.<//Text>

<text>Over priced for everything. Yea 4 dollars for a large soda doesn't seem bad... But no refills at all? And parking for 20 bucks seems kinda ridiculous. That's of course just my opinion though. It's a nice gym especially for volleyball, but I would like to be able to serve the same on any court. Not all court space is the same so some teams get more of a chance to save a ball while others get stuck watching it fall in to the nets that separate the courts.<//text>< Rating>

<rating>1</rating><Text>This “sports facility” is hardly deserving of one star.  It is clear to see that PROFIT is the only thing on their mind.   $10 for parking and $15 for entrance fee wouldn’t be so bad if you were going to sit in an air conditioned building. Since this isn’t an air conditioned building and feels like a sauna their fees are exorbitant.

The least they could do is open all doors and let a draft in.   They are content letting players and visitors sit here in the heat. It seems that they are willing to take the risk of a player having heat stroke in here while playing a sport.

I most definitely won’t be coming back here again.

Next time my kids play in a tournament I will ask the coach about the facilities.  I advise you to do the same.

The only reason parents are willing to come in here is because of the investment already made paying the club team fees.  This company is obviously taking advantage of that situation.<//Text>< pics>

Great place for tournaments. Food at their cafeteria was pretty pricey though. A quesadilla,  loaded nachos and 2 sodas cost $28.00. Later 2 sodas, a chocolate milk and a tigers milk bar was $17.00. The tigers milk bar was $4.00 by itself.</Review>

For volleyball tournaments, it is expensive to park ($20), expensive to get in ($9), expensive to eat, and very noisy.  On the upside, the courts are nice and they use electronic scoreboards that are elevated.  Now everyone can see when the girls working the scoreboard are not paying attention.< /Text>

We were set off track with time so we had to wait there longer than what was intended.We were supposed to start at 4:50 but ended up starting at 5:50. They did not allow refunds and they kept blaming it on the volleyball players before us. It was very unprofessional.</text>< pictures>

Parking is steep 20 bucks for tournaments and entrance is 8 per adult  but its overall a nice facility right off the  toll roads . its surrounded by great places to eat. However, if you want to grab a bite to eat there they have a massive selection of food from Chinese to salads at an affordable price.<//text>

We are new to the whole cub volleyball scene, and I have to say, it's not very fun. This complex is large enough, with nets dividing the courts. There is limited space to sit, even if you bring your own chairs, it's difficult to find a place to sit. Good luck, and if you get a super anal ref like we had last time, he'll ask you to move and find somewhere else to sit, but on other courts there were people sitting all around the courts. Maybe he was having a bad day or just picking on our group, I don't know. But by the end of the day people were sitting were ever they wanted and he never said a thing.

What is it with volleyball etiquette??? In club soccer, it's an unwritten rule, that when it's time for your child's team is play, the previous team (or parents), leave so that you can now watch your child play. Seems simple and courteous enough, right??? Well, not volleyball, everyone camps out to keep their spot. It's crazy and rude to me that you wouldn't get up and move so the next group can watch.

It's $20 to park, $7-8 to enter, just absurd. It was FREEZING in the gym, and I heard it's just as uncomfortable when it's hot out. There's no where to go to eat, they don't allow you to bring in your own food or drinks and the food is really expensive. Overall, not impressed with this facility AT ALL.<//text>

Charge to play...ok, that's cool.

Charge to park...huh?

Charge parents and siblings to come in and watch the kid you paid for play...wait, WHAT?!?

Pre-made salad and sandwich...$20...never again.</review>

<Review>I can't believe there were no fans during the coca cola tournament. There are 100s of games going on and your sweating like crazy. Really?! After paying $33 each for 3 adults and $18 for a kid they can't afford to rent fans!!! It's the worst tournament by far!
The only air conditioned rooms are the restrooms and eating area. It also looks like a new facility. Wow! Felt like I wasted my money.<//Review><rating>1< /rating>< Pictures>

<Text>The sports complex is big, has a nice cafeteria. However, it is extremely hot and it’s not eve summer time. The other downside is parking. $20 is way too much.<//Text>< Date>

<pics>None</pics><Text>Facility inside was nice and staff was cordial but the $20 parking and $8 admission was a joke.  I thought the cashier was joking when I had to pay $7 for a banana and a muffin! We already pay enough for our kids to play and shouldn't get hit with such outrageous fees. SCVA please find another location to use that isn't all about the money!< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Fabulous modern sports complex. I was in attendance for a volleyball tournament however they can accommodate other sports including basketball. Admittance was a little pricey $8 for adults and $7 for children. Parking can be found in nearby business parks for $20 at the event I attended.

The snack bar was impressive for this type of facility. There is a large variety of hot and cold food and beverages. Other traditional snacks are also available. Food ranges from american, asian, Mexican and snack bar food.

The facility is well ventilated and does not smell like a gym. This was a big deal for me as we spent about 7 to 8 hours inside. Bring captain chairs and enjoy. Ample seating for eating is available throughout the facility.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dcdc6de34a2461:0x7ae8c55c15b1b522<//Gmap_id>< username>

Volleyball tourneys: Parking $20. Admission $9.

In a warehouse district. Parking in done of the surrounding parking lots is pricey as well. Cafeteria food is good quality. 22 courts. Doesn't seem to get as got or cold as ASC. Best thing about this place is that the ONiell warehouse is 3 doors down and always has phenomenal prices.<//review>

Volleyball keeps us busy with tournaments all over.  This center is well put together with lot's of courts, clean bathrooms, a sports shop and great food...but the prices on the food are ridiculously high so bring a bunch of money or a picnic.< /Text>

Avoid if you can.  Attending this place is a huge rip-off.  And the quality is just not there.

Parking - high prices.  However, you can park inside Harvard park and walk.  They will tell you that you cannot; however, this is not the case.  Don't believe me?  Call the city of Irvine and ask.  Irvine city code says vehicles can be ticketed or towed after 72hrs of documented parking.

Food - trash.  It's about that bad.  They overcharge and it's all whitewash garbage.  Better off just sneaking food in.< /Review>

Parking is expensive at $20 but the food is great and they have electronic score boards. Bring ear plugs. Very loud and you ears will be ringing by the end of the day. I Bring stadium seats. The metal risers can get uncomfortable. The food is great. Philly cheese steak, carnitas with homemade salsa, breakfast plate, homemade hummus and veggies are our favorites but there are more choices.< /review>

The parking price is ridiculous $20.00 onsite and across  the street. Unless you drive a prius, your car will not fit in the on-site parking stalls if you intend on opening your doors. Admission is $8.00 per adult to walk in the door. Don't forget anything either, the food/drink pricing is equivalent or higher than a movie theater. However, if the cost doesn't deter you, they do have a really wide selection of food/drinks. The facility itself is good, other than they need another set of bathrooms to accommodate the number of people in the facility.</Text>

One star was generous, I wish I didn't have to give them that one. They charged $20 for parking, cash only, even for handicapped. Expect to be gouged at every lot on the entire block by their staff. They only accept cash for the entry also, but have an ATM that also charges a fee. The staff were not helpful at all and seating inside was poor, bring your own chairs. If you can skip attending any events at this subpar facility, that is the only recommendation that I can make in relation to this center.

I actually had to edit my review because I needed to add that there was no place to actually put a chair because the volleyball courts are arranged so poorly that you are literally arms length from the court. The noise level is intolerable and the line of the ladies restroom was extremely long because they lack proper facilities. Worst sports experience ever! This place is an embarrassment to organized sports and that is paying the facility a big compliment.<//Review>

After paying a fortune for parking and entrance the girls shouldn't have to worry about a leaky roof and puddles on the floor during their volleyball games! What a safety hazard! To make matters worse the ref didn't even care about the safety hazard!!! Court 11< /review>

Sent my kids to a week long sports camp and it was a complete waste of money.  The staff did the same things every day and when I observed they where more concerned with socializing with other staff than working with kids.  I wasn't at the camp all day but in my observations I didn't see any coaching or teaching and very little monitoring of the kids. The only redeeming camp quality according to both of my kids was that the food was good.

On the last day of camp my kids forgot water bottles and my daughters hat.  So I stopped in the following Monday to look for it and they told me I wasn't allowed but to leave a note with my information and the missing items description and they would call me back.  They didn't call back so I stopped in to ask (the annoyed and very rude front desk attendant) to look through the lost and found and was given the run around again and told only someone named Jamie can do that.  They refused to give me direct contact information for this person so I left another note for Jamie to call me.  He doesn't return the call so I am leaving messages on the phone for them to call me and finally after about three weeks of trying to get ahold of someone I get a call (not from Jamie) saying they donated all the lost and found items.  So they donated lost and found items over the weekend and one day after they had been left.  Not even being allowed to look for my kids items is just idiotic.

This place is a joke and I can't speak for Jamie other than he doesn't return calls, but the girl working the front desk is about as bad a receptionist as I have every come across.

The camp was a waste of time and money and the staff is a joke!  I am sure it isn't all staff but it certainly applies to the individuals I had to deal with.< /text>

Giving it  a 0ne  star due to the fact that you already paid $20 for parking $9 admission. Also the food at the food court is overpriced. As a parent is a lot of money due to the fact that you already paid hundreds and hundreds of dollars for your daughter to play Club volleyball.  One of the girls from the opposing team got hurt we went to go get some ice and they went ahead and charged a dollar. You would think for all the money they charged to get in and 20 For parking. You get some ice for a sprained ankle. Other volleyball facilities have trained Medical personnel helping out for any injuries on the players

<text>A huge complex so obviously designed to maximize profit and minimize customer comfort:  $20 to park in a crappy, crammed lot full of compact spaces, plus an entry fee on top of that.  1 set of bathrooms for a thousand people.  Little court side seating.  Again...it's all about how many courts can we possibly cram in here to make the most money??</text><response>None< /response></record>

Loud overcrowded expensive...
But it's not like we have a choice right? Get there early to get a spot to sit.  They have a restaurant on site that's has some decent selection mid-price< /Text>

Good sport center. Lots of court that can be booked for basketball, volleyball etc. Provide people with free cold water. Parking can be confusing for a first timer.< /Text>

It's ok. Always dirty floors at the courts. Like no one cleans. Our coaches sweep our courts. Takes away time from the court rental. Expensive like Disneyland for parking and still have to pay to get in. Even parking across the street is just as expensive as front row. What the heck!<//Review>

On top of having to pay a registration fee they charge you $10.00 for parking plus another $7.00 per person to watch your child play. Facility is okay but a bit costly for a bunch of courts.</Text>

Nice place. Parking is exspensive $20. Entrance is $7 adults  $5 seniors & military with ID.  Food is exspensive!   Needs more seats. Bring your own chairs if you can.</Text>

No AC. 108 degrees outside and there were players passing out and fans during a basketball tournament due to heat exhaustion.  It was better to be outside then inside.  Charged for parking and then charged again to get in. Expensive cheap frozen uncooked food. If you are going to create a venue and not have AC installed and you have 20 full basketball courts inside, this is a hazard.</text>

Was there over the weekend of March second and third for a volleyball tournament. The gym is conveniently located but parking fills up really early in the morning and it's $20 to park anywhere nearby. the city has seen fit to block off the streets from any parking anywhere within probably a half a mile away momentous must make a ton of money off of parking alone. the place was clean they have food and places to sit but everything's expensive.</review>

<review>Transitioning to Momentous after the split with Misty May Treanor - the MMT logo is still everywhere.  The facility itself is quite nice, well-organized and there is a better than average snack bar.  What I object to is the high fee for parking and admission ($20 and $8) for girls volleyball.  It is also true that nearly every adjoining business has guards out front to discourage parking.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

< review>
We play here basketball.
The night shift manager (Joshua, i think) has an attitude problem. Last week he moved our personal stuff (wallets, watches car keys) without asking, and used offensive tone when we told him he should ask our permission.
This week, this Joshua guy interrupted our game and threatened to throw us out because a player that was waiting out a game, was shooting baskets on another court, and per the night manager: "we only rent one court.
The place has tens of courts, and usually only a few are occupied when we play.
This may be the last straw for us, as the place has no air conditioning or vent system, and the courts are crowded - there's hardly any out-of-boundary area for our stuff or people that are waiting out a game. So, metal benches are placed on the court line, which is dangerous.< /review>

This is basically a giant warehouse or convention center space with dozens of sports courts for basketball, volleybal, indoor soccer, etc. If you've been to American Sports Center (ASC) in Anaheim you know what I mean. The parking is $20 and there is really no street parking available nearby. Turning into the parking lot can be an adventure in the morning since the line of cars gets long and the layout isn't designed for one line turning right into the lot and another line coming from the other direction turning left into the same driveway. The food is ok (ASC is better) but I've had a lot worse at other similar venues. There's a small eating area with a few tables in the cafe and a slightly smaller area on the other side of the building with tables and chairs. And there are small bleachers courtside and not much room for folding chairs.< /Review>

Great venue for volleyball, and excellent food options, but the parking seems a bit pricey given the amount families already pay annually for traveling sports for their kids.</Text>

We are in Irvine for our daughter's basketball tournament which is costing us nearly $600.00 in gas and lodging alone. Get to the Misty Treanor complex to be charged $10.00 to park each day and $15.00 per person to get into tournament each day. So we are talking a total of $55.00 a day for my family to watch my daughter play basketball. It is a shame that the MMSC would allow such robbery of hard working families of their hard earned money. Very disappointing.</Text>

This place although large is hot, they charge for EVERYTHING excessively, parking, admissions, even for kids, the food is overpriced and not good. My least favorite sports center that we attend. I dread it ever time we have to go there.< /text>

This place sucks. The on-site medical staff tried to charge us $1 for ice to treat an injured player. That of course is after Misty May charged us $15 for parking and $6 a person for the privilege to enter her shrine.</Review>

Terrible facility policy!

They charge parking for my game at 9:00 and when i returned for my game at 2, they charged me again and said there is no in and out. I kept my paid ticket, so there is no reason to gouge the parents and charge Parking again and again.

I've been to many basketball tournaments all over and this is the ONLY facility that does this crap!< /Text>

Absurd that they charge $20 to park and block off any other parking, opening up a few other area for $15. This is not Pro! Not even colleges charge this much. Food prices outrageous too.</text>

<Review>Money hungry, it's really bad, they want to charge extra for parking and they won't let you park on the street, you can't bring food or drinks in, Disney Land prices for everything. We the parents already pay the club team that pays for the tournaments. This is for the kids and family. The coaches have to pay for parking, what is that all about.< /Review>< gmapID>

The facility is fine but the parking is too expensive ($20) and you often have to pay to park in a lot far from the facility.<//Text>

<Text>The Facilities are great but Parking fee are ridiculous, they don't validate specially if you are from out of town with back to back and a long wait between the tournament games, we should be able to get out and come back on the same day, sometimes people are on a budget for the league and hotel accommodation, the food inside are very expensive  just like a theme park.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>
