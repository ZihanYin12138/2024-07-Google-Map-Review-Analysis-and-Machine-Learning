<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I have gone to kennolyn for 3 year sand look forward to it every year. The staff are so nice and accommodating. I am a picky eater but they always make sure I have things to eat. All the activities are great and safe even with possibly  dangerous things like archery. I have never gotten homesick all four times I have went most times I don't want to go home. I have made great friends that I still keep in contact with even months after camp. All the counselors are so nice and helpful.  Outpost is always great you may not sleep the best but you're in the woods :) They make special dietary meals like vegan, gluten free, and diary free meals.  I highly suggest Kennolyn.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808e3e5971cb934d:0x77a318a32ad7c5f3< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Kennolyn Camp has become a fundamental part of our families life. My boys love it so much and look forward to it all year. Every detail is considered and every request attended to with kindness. The leadership of the entire staff is exemplary. You can tell that everyone is invested in creating a positive experience for all. Our children are engaged and having fun all day and always come home with enthusiastic reports.< /review>

Kennolyn is everything a summer camp should be.  They have all the activities you'd expect and many more.  The owners and Sr. staff are stable and they do such a good job of hiring exceptional college students to be counselors.  My daughter grows so much each summer during the weeks she is at camp.  Her manners improve, her ability and willingness to help around the house improves, and her self-efficacy is noticeably boosted.  And the best part is that she has no idea that Kennolyn is teaching her so much- she's just having fun.< /Review>

We had our son start his first year at camp here and he has loved it so much! Throughout these uncertain times it is a big decision to let our kiddos go into the care of others. The Camp Kennolyn staff has been SO professional and extremely organized. It gives great peace of mind to families. My child comes home happy every day and loves to tell me all about his adventures from each day. Thank you!<//Text>

<text>My boys just completed their second week of Kennolyn and today, on their last day, my 8 year old got into the car and gave me a piece of candy from their egg hunt in the forest and said “here Mom, this is for you to thank you for letting us come to Kennolyn this Summer so I could do so many cool things”! Every single day for two weeks on our car rides home my boys would talk enthusiastically about all of the activities they did, the friends they made, the new things they tried. I honestly haven’t seen my boys this happy and excited about anything in months and I am so thankful for all of the wonderful people at Kennolyn that created this truly special place and program. My boys are already talking about what they’re excited for most at Kennolyn for next summer!<//text>< Name>

<Review>Phenomenal day camp experience!  It has always been our favorite, and in 2020 Kennolyn stands out even more.  Kennolyn has a careful and rigorous approach to managing camp safety during COVID that we are very comfortable with.  Kids come home tired from swimming, archery, climbing wall, outdoor cooking, and of course fun and engaging counselors.  So happy Kennolyn found a way to make camp a go this year.  First rate program focused on stewardship, friendship, independence, flexibility, and the joys of outdoors.</Review>< gmap_id>

LOVE Kennolyn, the people who make it possible and the mission that they stand for. I spent 10 summers at camp and I can say without a doubt that my experience shaped the person I am today for the better! One of the best things you can do for your children is send them to sleepaway camp. Highly recommend <3<//Text>

<review>This year we were finally old enough to attend camp Kennolyn, and then COVID. After months of quarantine, time away from home and outdoors was just what my 6 year old needed. Of course we had ambivalence sending our camper out of our nest. After attending an information webinar and reading the guidelines and camp structure, we felt confident that the staff were knowledgable, strategic, and well planned to open camp. And Camp Kennolyn did not disappoint. We are very pleased with our experience in the face of these trying times. Thank You Camp Kennolyn!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5UqDE0nQBGR1_R35SCbIB6xlVjjHEYAig575D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

The first word I have to describe our families experience with Kennolyn is THANKFUL.  We are thankful that my son at 11 or 12 (now 19), who didn’t want to go to sleep-away camp for fear of no outlets and video games, got out of the car (under extreme protest) that fateful first day.

We are thankful that he found a camp environment he would embrace and become passionate about each and every year since and all the way through being a Junior counselor. We are thankful that his younger sister, now in the leadership program, has had an equally exceptional experience (less any protesting).  😊

We are thankful for Kennolyn leadership, the environment, the values, the caring, the traditions, the welcoming inclusion, the activities (old and new school) and the camp features.   The experiences and friendships will last a lifetime.<//Text>

I have been going to Kennolyn since I was seven years old, this camp is one of the most fantastic life experiences ever. The staff poles the whole thing together, meeting people from different states and even different countries, you get to learn about there life and their experience at camp, but most importantly they make your experience better. This upcoming summer of 2019 will be my 8th year at camp, and I am going to continue to go for as long as I can, so I can make other kids experience the great things I experienced at Camp Kennolyn.</review>

<Text>My daughters absolutely love Kennolyn.  They have attended a week-long camp for the past four summers and they are all signed up for the fifth! The girls look forward to camp all year long.  Their experiences at Kennolyn have resulted in so many fond memories.  We have had many chats over the years about camp and they often can barely contain themselves when discussing their time there. As a parent, I take great comfort in Kennolyn's warm & caring staff, fantastic facilities and commitment to excellence in everything they do.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808e3e5971cb934d:0x77a318a32ad7c5f3< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I think camp Kennolyn was a ok experience. Here are a few reasons: the camp  made us where clothes I didn’t want to have to where, and there wasn’t many social things because we had so many different classes and had to switch different friends each class, (at least it’s what it felt like)m. I liked the activities though.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Today I had a great experience with the Mgr. of the Portola, Foothill Ranch location.
I shop there often and the store is kept neat and clean, team members are always friendly,  polite and ready to help.
However, last night I lost an item in the store, and let me just say the manager went over and above to help me find my  lost item.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!< /Text>

Michael's has some great coupons if you look on the app or online sometimes up to 40% off. They are down to a skeleton crew but they are still very helpful, as always. Parking is super easy and they have sanitizer and wipes at the door. People are respectful of the mask mandate, so it's never awkward. Good place.<//Review>

A great place for all of your seasonal holiday needs.  Using online coupons along with store promotions is a great way to save a bundle during this holiday season.  They have, for Christmas,  garlands, wreaths, ornaments, tree toppers, festive pillows, birds, and snowmen, artificial flowers, as well as general purpose hobby materials such as art paints, canvases and many other things you find from a typical arts and crafts store.</Text>

I really  like this location it's a huge store with a bit of everything. Its always been very spaced out which makes it easier to keep distance thou theres still customers that totally ignore social distancing and make no effort to keep away. Employees  do this as well. It's not hard to stay 6 feet away from people if everyone would just try! It was very busy certain no signs of people "staying home"

They can't control customers but please teach employees they can talk n help customers while standing at least 6feet away< /review>

I really love Michaels for their prices. Having said that, it pays to be pay attention to what you're buying. Today they had a Buy 1, get 2 free, paper packs. They also had clearance items that were on the bottom shelf of the display, that were not part of the Buy 1, get 2 free. Once I was at the register,I told the cashier I wanted to make sure all items were part of that deal. Turns out 2 weren't, but there was no way to make sure which items weren't! Luckily the lady who came over to help the cashier, decided to give me the date price for all of it! It helps to double check & to make sure you ask. Everyone I've dealt with at Michaels has been really nice<//Text>

I shop a lot in this store and usually have a very good experience.  Unfortunately, because of the corona virus situation, they adopted a new method of shipping flowers.  They do not ship them like they usually would from the warehouse.  They ship them from a local store instead.  The flowers are arriving dirty and damaged.  I made many customer  service calls, but it is pointless. The product they ship is unusable and should be thrown away. If you go to the local store to complain, they will tell you that we didn't pack this and it must be another store. The manager sees no problem with this situation, since I could return it, no need to apologize. She told me I'm not invited to shop in this store.  I spent a lot of money at this store location and online for my business.<//Review>< pictures>

It was my first trip in a Michaels store. I went there because I saw items on the web that they sold. The store staff was very friendly and even though I asked for an obscure item they not only know which aisle it was on but which Shelf at what level. I think they might have been robots in Disguise. Nonetheless I'm going back in for my third time this week</Review>

This place never had help and I could barely find what I needed. No further assistance asked nor was I asked if I needed help. It was very hot in the store and had to wait a very long time in line. Not only that forget about returning anything here. They do not apply any returns to your order they do a whole separate order put it on a gift card then ring your items up. What a waste of time after already spending a ton of time in line. Also really? You have to have an ID for a 2$ return. What a joke or you can't return the item. This place has gone down hill and was never like this when I worked there.</text>

<Text>This place is way too expensive for custom mats. I tried to go in without my picture (since I had taken all the measurements at home) and they told me I needed to bring it in. Ok fine. I bring it in, and THEN they tell me the price, which is way more than I wanted to spend. They could have saved me the trouble to hauling my large picture and frame around town and just told me originally an estimated price range based on the measurements I provided. Overall, a very obsolete and disappointing place that tries to stay in business by inflating prices.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Great store! Lots of items to window shop. Everytime I go here I come out with a shopping cart full of stuff. New looking and old looking stuff. Pictures, frames, tool trays, flowers, too many items to mention here, you better just visit. You will not be disapointed.</Text>

<review>Called to look for an item in store, seeing as three other locations were out of stock. Maybe I'll buy it online or maybe I'll forget about Michaels all together. Telling a potential customer that they aren't speaking English then hanging up is rude. I don't care if there are a lot of foreigners in this country,  I grew up here as well as my family. Not my fault if you don't know what a "planner" is or the words "budget."</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

She claimed that there is no stacking of any coupons whatsoever, we explained that the store has allowed me to get my senior discount with anything including all 50%off on regular price item's, Michelle the manager of foothills ranch store belittled me in front of numerous customers saying if you can't afford the cost don't buy it , I again asked for my discount and was denied due Manager at the checkout register.

GUIDANCE FOR EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS IN
ENFORCING MASK REQUIREMENTS
Employers must ensure that workers comply with safe and healthy work
practices, including the use of face coverings as required by the CDPH
guidelines or equivalent protection when a worker cannot use a face covering.
Employers should handle face covering requirements the same way that the
employer enforces other health and safety requirements at the workplace.
Employers may require the public to wear face coverings in their establishments,
and at a minimum should strongly encourage members of the public to wear
face coverings, using signage and requests to the public before they enter the
establishment. Making the public aware of requirements and expectations
before they enter an establishment is the best way to minimize confrontation
and encourage compliance. Making disposable courtesy face coverings
available to those who don’t have them is also recommended.
Workers should avoid confronting coworkers or members of the public who are
not wearing a face covering for the purpose of attempting to enforce any face-
covering recommendation or requirement.
In these instances, workers should maintain at least a 6-foot distance from others
and raise any concerns to their supervisor.
Employers should train their workers on what to do in such situations, including
how to minimize risk of workplace violence and what to do to get support when
de-escalation efforts are unsuccessful in these situations.
Consider using the following language:
• “Following the guidelines (on face coverings or distancing) can protect
you and everyone else, so we ask that you follow them.”
• “If you don’t have a face covering, we’d be happy to provide one (if
available).”
• For customers and visitors to the workplace: “We regret that you’re
unwilling to follow the guidelines. Please give us a bit of time to organize
the area to allow additional physical distance between you and other
people.”
In all instances, it is important to focus on minimizing risk and to practice de-
escalation measures:
• Speak with a calm voice at a normal volume and communicate with
posture and expression that the person will be respected.

Settle on a method for calling in support from security or law enforcement
if needed.< /review>

I always felt like something was just disconnected.  I took it to a auto stereo shop and without even checking it I was told it was totally dead (I knew that) and that it would be more expensive to fix and I would just have to buy a new one. I went to Panchocisco and his fee was so reasonable to inspect it. He backed my truck out 15 minutes later with my stereo playing!!! He replaced two burnt out fuses.  The inspection fee covered the work.  I will be back with my car. I found him to be honest, direct and affordable for my budget.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Purchased my Kenwood stereo April 23rd. Took the best day and time suggested by Isabel, the following Tuesday in the afternoon because of a possible dr's appointment. Got the call the Drs appointment was rescheduled and immediately called Isabel who gladly pushed my appointment to 9:30 am. I was taken in on time, the AC and electrical were checked before any removal or installation was started. Once the work was started it was done both quickly and professionally. While I briefly waited I notice Poncho personally interact with other potential or previous customers. He was pleasant, spoke clearly, and was very accommodating. As a matter of fact while there I found out he  also does tinting and because of the service I got at the stereo business I'm going to get my windows tinted from him as well.<//Text>

<text>I've been going to Panchocisco since they've been open. He has installed stereo and beat in every car I've had. You have to have plenty of patience in order to get your car done properly, which he does diligently. Very knowledgeable on what is needed for your vehicle, also affordable.

<name>John Mark</name><text>I’m honestly just disappointed. It had to have been an amateur worker who drilled 2 screws into my spare tire where the bracket holding my subwoofer box to the floor was. I didn’t notice until I needed to use my spare tire what had been done I couldn’t even take out the tire without unscrewing the screws. After a long night of being stuck on the side of the road I brought it to the attention of the year boss. I wanted my spare tire replaced and since you cannot patch the sidewall of a  tire I felt a new tire was fair. Two weeks later almost 3 weeks later I finally get back my original tire and it has a tumor in it. Let’s just hope that it doesn’t pop if I ever need to use it. Thanks Pancho Cisco tunes.< /text>< gmap_id>

<Text>PanchoCisco Tunes Car Stereo & Alarm is more than a car stereo & alarm store.
They also install car window glass regulators & fix any car door locks.
I was skeptical when I first went in to have them fix my door lock, but I came out impressed with the work and their honest labor charge amount. Their parts prices and labor charges are very competitive and  one of the best in the Vallejo market.
Francisco, the owner, is very up-front with his Store Policy and will emphasize that any possible issue resulting from doing business with him can be solved in a “polite, civilized manner”.
Now, I’ve gone back a couple more times for services on another vehicle and my opinion hasn’t changed one bit, because I trust them to take care of my issue and my vehicle at a fair price!< /Text>< Time>

If you need an alarm, car stereo system, windows tinted, car wrapped, you name it, this guy can do it all. He is an expert with car electronics. I been coming here for years. I can't say you will get the best price because as with everything, you get what you pay for. And this guy does very high quality work.< /Text>

<review>These guys do amazing work with HID installments along with car alarms. They lay it down straight and let you know that a rushed job, is a bad job. Be patient and let them work and you won’t be disappointed!</review>< pics>

<review>I bought Hid's from this place and had them installed. It took them 2.5 hours to install... the lights went out right when I left the place so I took car back and they fixed it.. that same day the lights went out again.... so I called them to setup appointment.. so I came in the next day right when they open business doors.. owner told me he is going to put technicians on my car to fix car right away... I wait their 6 hrs for them to me I have a short in my light wiring harness... I told him my car was working fine with the regular lights I had on before he put HID's in so he charge me for light relay  fuse... so the light were working until I drove down the street... they don't know what they are doing... avoid them if you can.. they mess up your car< /review><response>None<//response><Time>1479270309016</Time><GmapID>0x80857367dcc65bab:0xad964433c04ce514<//GmapID>< Pics>

Warning. Warning. WARNING!!!

Don't let it be said someone didn't warn you about this place.  The guy is a hack. My car came back with a stereo nonfunctioning..  Opened up the dash to find duct taped in speakers.  Wires run Willy nilly..

Then you go back to the guy and just like that..  He doesn't answer the phone.  Chase him down, he tells you it worked perfectly when it left the shop.. Hey buddy,  I'm calling you back the same day..

Warning. Warning.  WARNING!!!< /text>

Oh man..  Stay away from Pancho Cisco Tunes and Alarms in Vallejo.

That guy (Francisco) is a straight out incompetent crook.  He botched up a complete car stereo install on my classic car.  I had to take it to another car stereo place, where they pulled it out, and replaced everything.  The problem?  Francisco didn't set the screen angle before he installed the stereo and when it opened it hit the back of my instrument cluster and that was it.. The stereo was broken.

Now Francisco is running around trying to get everyone to believe he didn't do it.  All the other stereo places did was push a button, dude..  Your unit hit the back wall all by itself.  For 2-weeeks I tried to get you to fix it..!!  Then when I call the manufacturer, they tell me you aren't an authorized dealer and we are stuck with a broken unit?  That you broke??

If you want this to happen to you.  Pancho Cisco Tunes is your place.  If not, try looking just a little north of them.  There's a great car stereo place on broadway!</Review>

<text>Went back for another vehicle. Opposite experience. Pancho was not as friendly and very condescending. He was stressed out about his employees and their work product. Jerry rigged the whole system that cost me $800.00. Nesa stereo, Sony amp that worked when it wanted to. Subs that sounded like someone was putting their hand on the speaker. Bluetooth that did not play music from any phone only the radio or aux.

Had to use another guy in Vacaville who also charged  $800.00 but for a system but installed Kenwood amp and kicker woofer with kenwood deck. He even fixed the jerry rigged ignition switch wire that turns the radio on the right way.

Pancho has gone the other way with his customer service and work product. Not impressed nor will you be.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80857367dcc65bab:0xad964433c04ce514< /gmap_id></record>

At the end of everything I do not know who of the two is going to get tired first of all, I'm waiting for him to answer me for what I already paid him or to get tired of my insistence and install what I asked him from the beginning!

I installed also the springs of the back door and they exploded 2 days after installing the door also because I was too big for my car and still does not answer!

Al final de todo no se quien de lo dos se va a cansar primero yo de estar esperando a que me responda por lo que ya le pague o el se canse de mi insistencia y me instale lo que desde un principio le pedí!

Dive bar vibes, can be a good thing. Never over crowded and chill people. They have pool here and some outdoor seating if weather is nice.</Text>

They have 3 pool tables which they do not charge for. If it's legal to serve alcohol, they are open. Fantastic after work type place to grab a drink and down your sorrows from the days stresses. Will absolutely be returning to this awesome place.< /Review>< Pics>

It's changed since the middle 90s. Looks very nice, clean, and quiet. Had a nice picnic lunch there. Restroom on site.< /Text>

<review>I have been there during daytime, very, very nice and clean and we'll taken care of. I'm sure the big baseball field has nothing to do with that though. Out playing with my suicidal drone one afternoon and I look around and there's a boy in a base-a-ball uni looking at me. Let's do the time warp again! No, no. Anyway I asked if he was going to play a game that day. Yes he said, and your in center field! No way dude, I didn't even have a glove! Told him look, I'm busy picking up drone pieces and no one his size is going to hit to deep center field and if they do, it's a home run anyway! A couple crashes later he said bye as there must have been 3outs or my deep center reasoning made sense. Picked up pieces of drone and booked it as fog was rolling in. I did see one person waving, I wavied back, hope he hit a homer at his next time at bat.< /review>< Pictures>

Great games being played out here! Snack bar available during games and parking ain't bad'... now if we could just get some scoreboards? Hmmm. Come out and support.</Review>

I’ve been a loyal customer here at Cost-U-Less for many years. I love this insurance company because they really do help you on the getting the lowest rates as well as a getting the things you want included in your policy.  I just came in actually to add my bf to my policy with his car, and they did an amazing job with considering I’ve been a loyal customer, to help with a low down payment because we switched to our policy to Stonewood. Definitely recommend anybody to Cost-U-Less.<//Text>

< review>
I talked to a really nice and helpful lady, at the Cost-U-Less in Tulare, named Marlen, after my insurance went from 175 a month to $287 a month(that's almost $110 a month more!) and I was desperately looking for something that was more affordable.  She got me insurance that was at a rate of $131 a month (That's way cheaper than it was before!) When everyone else was giving quotes of $250-$300 a month for me! Marlen was really kind and considerate on the phone and it felt like talking to a real person who cared about my situation,  so I just want her company to recognize her value because she really helped me a lot!<//review>

<name>Erica< /name><response>None< /response><text>Worst customer service ever & I wouldn't recommend anyone to go through them for car insurance. While adding a vehicle to our policy the guy was rude & unprofessional, answered a phone call while helping me & not once listening to me or looking at my paperwork. He messed up my policy by adding wrong information about my vehicles & I didn't know because the guy didn't give me copys like he should have & I asked him 3 time's for. I found out only after paperwork was mailed to me, then I went into the office & it was only the guy working & 8 other people waiting so I went back later in the day which he closed 4 hour's earlier than he should have. I had to get another Cost U Less involved & they had to get  corporate involved, finally got a little somewhere with them but not completely fixed. I'm still not happy with all the run around I had & trouble they caused. I'm definitely not sticking with this insurance place any more.< /text>< pics>

<Text>I bought two of these lamps on November 1st. First I want to say, every employee I have interacted with was amazingly friendly. I am also impressed with the quality of product they have. The lamps I bought are steel and glass. Comparative products are made completely of plastic; both base and shades.

The three star rating is for two reasons.
1) issues from a corporate level. I ordered the lamps online. There was NO option for home delivery. Only to store delivery with me going to the store for pickup.  Because I could not have the product delivered to my house I had to wait 7-10 days before pickup vs 3 to 5 for home delivery
2) issues store level. When the lamps arrived in store no one called me. The lamps should have arrived no later than the 11th. I called them today, November 13th to see if they were in. They were and I left within five minutes of hanging up the phone with them. Once there they couldn't find both lamps. "Because there were a lot of customer packages on the back". Hint: call them and let them know their orders are in.

They were very kind to load both lamps boxes in my vehicle. I truly appreciated the effort.

Advice from a former Retail Store Manager and Regional Operations Manager: Your stock area is a gold mine for profit. Keep it organized and have processes in place call customers when orders arrive. An organized backroom also increases your customer service and review ratings will go up.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7TXGDzcswTMZHnK2pL192CmeB7xlVATM_Ls8h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

The first time I went to the store I was surprised or better yet a little bit of shock. Because I'm not used to going to the stuff at stores I don't want to sound a little bit cliche but it's more like a girl type of store. But I actually had a great time they have a lot of stuff not just for girls but for anybody but do your Christmas shopping in a lot of excellent metal work in their craftsmanship you guess your check it out. And also you supporting your local stores so give it a shot<//Review>

Went in for my first time recently after hearing such great things about this place. Ive always seen the store, but didnt know exactly what it was. So after my trip to the dollar store (next door) I decided to stop in. They had a sign out front promoting 40% off, so of course they had me convinced that I NEEDED to go inside.  Such a bad idea. That store is amazing. Reminds me of Pier One or Cost Plus, sooooo many cute pieces for home decor. I loved the Christmas items. I ended up with a few xmas tree ornaments and a super cute sign. Became a member of the rewards program. I will definitely be going back.< /text>

I love Kirklands! They have so many beautiful and unique home decorating and holidays items. I wish there was one closer to my home. But I will travel to this one now that I know about it. They are just bringing in all their Christmas decor now.<//Review>

They can't do receipt lookup. They don't even offer an email copy. And they don't tell you when you buy that you have to keep your receipt. Its 2020, get with the technology. Bout just 2 weeks ago. And the manager calls you "hun"... im not 15, ew!< /text>

I always get the most amazing customer service here. The manager has such a friendly and welcoming personality and even took the time to see if she could find what I was looking for online on their site. I ended up ordering 14 tall mirrors and received a discount. My mirrors came in a few weeks later and the wonderful ladies helped me load them with care so that they would get to their destination with ease.<//review>

Always new things at Kirklands, yet they need to rotate the picture section more often.  Customer Service is very good, as I had to return two pieces of furniture that just did not work where I had hoped.  After a quick inspection we were refunded completely.  We probably spend too much here, but cant keep away from the great variety of goods.< /Review>

<Review>Always find what we need. Customer service wonderful. We were looking for a large livingroom wall clock. Didn't want to spend a lot but the ones we've seen were above what we were willing to spend. We found the perfect wall clock and an added extra goodie it was the last one they had so they clearanced it out and we got it for pennies in comparison to the others we've seen. So happy with the purchase!!!< /Review>< username>

< Review>
I ordered a picture online over 5 weeks ago and I get an email that my order is ready for pickup after 4weeks and it's still not there. Employee tells me that they tell corporate to change their wording all the time but they don't listen. Very frustrating that it takes over a month to receive something you ordered and still waiting....<//Review>

This is a great apartment complex. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you are happy and comfortable in your apartment. If you aren’t, they will help! There is always someone cleaning the common areas. Hallways, elevators, trash room etc. It’s nice and clean always. I love the outdoor areas to hangout in. All of the appliances in my unit are brand new. The bathtub is big and deep, unlike many apartments. I’ve already been here a year and would love to spend a couple more here. Oh! I forgot to mention, my AC stopped blowing cold air the other day. I put a maintenance request in online, and they were here in about an hour to come fix it. Took them no time at all.< /text>

It used to be a good apartment complex. After the management team changes, its service becomes really worse.

1) I lived there for several years and recently moved out from it. Since I left in a hurry, I did not moved out all my furniture and told the leasing office. They said they will charge 50-100 USD for that. Then I just received a letter from them telling me that they charge me about $1300 for the trash and cleaning fee, also including $381 full paint fee for 2+2, but I am actually living in a one bedroom apartment. STAY AWAY FROM MAIN STREET VILLAGE!

2) my car was broken into and staff inside the car was stolen. Many other residents met the same issue but the management team do nothing.

3) it is not a smoking free apartment building.

4) Management is horrible. Every single lease I've signed i've bugged the front office multiple times and they lag in preparing the documents.
In summary, there's much nicer places in Irvine with actual respectable residents and staff that will take care of you.< /Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1614799815226, 'text': 'Unfortunately, the maintenance that was required to make the apartment presentable for the incoming resident was extensive after your move-out. Leaving behind excessive trash and furniture results in our trash company charging us more for the disposal. Your unit also required additional painting and cleaning due to excessive damage which resulted in a much higher than average balance such as this.  We quoted $50-$100 per item left behind depending on size, not in total to completely clear out furniture and other items that were left behind. We charged not for a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom, but for the 2nd coat of paint as the first coat (not charged to you) did not suffice to cover the condition the walls were left.  Our average move-out cost on a one-bedroom is $300. Also, we address any and all concerns including smoking when we are able to determine the offender. Smoking is not tolerated in our community. We offer a 12-hour standing guard, gates, cameras, and other security measures, which is far more than our competition, to dissuade crime. We post signage throughout the community reminding residents to lock their cars and leave nothing insight or of value. Irvine Police Department sends us letters that we e-blast to the community warning residents to lock their cars and remove anything of value. We have sent you thorough photos to demonstrate how significant the damage was, and explained to you the charges since this was posted.'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

COVID makes a fair review hard. The community is pretty, my apartment has a nice layout, since moving in (6 months)my bathroom door has fallen off, garbage disposal broke and unfixed water damage stains have resurfaced so not overly impressed with what's below the pretty paint.   Can't comment fairly on service since I typically avoid reaching out, when I do the service is either spectacular or horrible.< /text>

It used to be a good apartment complex. After the management team changes, its service becomes really worse. My car was break into and staff inside the car was stolen. Many other residents met the same issue but the management team do nothing. Also, It is not a smoke free community. I have complained numerous times to the management team but they simply tells me to call the security to catch the smoker in action myself......so when I am sleeping at night, I smell the smoke again and have to get up and call the security at midnight. It happens many times during one single day......ready bad experience......</Review></record>

I just moved in but I like it so far! The community seems great. The apartments are also very nice.  I am giving 4 stars because the soundproofing is light.  My upstairs neighbor loves to stomp.</Text>

I will be updating my review later when I finish moving out here.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1606253411891, 'text': "Hi Sylvia, We're sorry to hear you feel this way.

It's a nice apartment with good amenities, but the price is high as is to be expected. Main issues I have that lower the rating to 3.5 is when my bike wheel was stolen the front office told me they'd look into it but they never did. Also free coffee no longer includes alternative milks which feels discriminatory since I'm lactose intolerant and it isn't by choice I drink non-dairy. The floors in our apartment are stained dirty and they came to clean them when we first moved in but it didn't really do anything.< /review>

She showed us all of the amenity spaces (even the cool little garden in the back of the property.) We were. Pleasantly surprised with how nice the apartments are for the price we thought that they would be dated, but everything was brand new.

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I have lived here for years. Three years ago I would have given this property 4 and possibly even 5 stars, but about a year ago the property was sold by Lincoln Property Group to Legacy Partners, a much smaller company. Ownership and management changed over. The quality of life here has decreased significantly and the rent has gone up 35% in three years. As others have mentioned the property has roach and spider infestations. It is dirty. Despite numerous requests from tenants for repair, the main elevator has worked periodically for 6 months now. Meanwhile, Legacy only invests in the aesthetics of the property in order to lease new units but once you sign that contract you're doomed! Beware. Nearing 10 years old, the property is aging but rents continue to escalate. Management turns-over frequently and blames any problems they are not able to resolve on "corporate." There are many newer & nicer properties in the area at the same price point. At over $2+ mo. per sq. foot this property is outrageously overpriced for what it is. I will say the management crew that has been here for years is awesome but they are overworked and spread thin. Do yourself a favor and choose a nicer, newer property near by for a much better value.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

My wife and I had great interactions with the leasing staff, Maureen and Alexa specifically. Answered all of our questions (we had a lot, it probably got annoying). We looked around at many other places and they had nice people too but it seemed different here. We got to see how the staff also interacts with the current residents which made us feel comfortable choosing Main Street Village. After moving in things have still been really good. Thanks MSV!< /Review>

If I could give negative stars I would, this place is a rip off, they tell you one price that will be your move out costs then they send you a letter saying it is beyond the 800.00 security deposit then 3 months later they send you another bill... they don't clean up the dog messes in the dog area, they don't provide monthly water and trash bills then decide to just make up numbers...<//text>

< Review>
I am a San Franciscan and I have just moved for the first time to Los Angeles.  I spent weeks looking at apartment complexes and rental houses.  We chose this place, because we loved the grounds, the set-up of our apartment and the square footage vs. price.  Main Street Village has been amazing since we have moved in.  The staff is wonderful!!  The maintenance people (especially Isabel and Jose!!!) are wonderful, polite and fix any issues we have within 24 hours and are always so kind and helpful.  They clearly love working here as much as we love living here!!  Thank you so much to Joseph and Jeff for making our move go so smoothly!!  We LOVE IT here!!!</Review>

Just love living at MSV. It's my little paradise!  I originally came to live here for a year. It's been over 3. Enjoy the events and amenities. One of the best aspects is Carolyn's Gym. Great way to work out, meet new friends and have some fun. Staff is really friendly! My family truly enjoys visiting.<//Text>

<Review>The Main Street Village apartments was an amazing community.  I lived here for approximately six months and I enjoyed every minute of it.  The staff was super courteous and friendly and any maintenance issues that we had were immediately resolved within a couple of hours.  I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone seeking a new home.<//Review>< pics>

I have lived at Main Street Village for about 7 years and love the property.   The office manager and staff are very friendly and helpful.   A few of my favorite things about the community are Carolyn's Gym, which is an outside gym on the rooftop of the parking structure; location, location, location....easy airport and freeway access; community events, especially the "Cooking with Carolyn" class and the ongoing Carolyn's Pine Table on social media.    If you are looking for a property that makes you feel welcome you have chosen the right place.<//Review>

< Review>
Editing my review to add how much I hate the new parking rules. It sucks to come home and by 6 pm the entire basement is full and then have to take a 3-4 min drive up to the fifth floor. Why exactly they charging 75$ p month for the empty parking spaces throughout the floors is a mystery to me.

OG review- The new parking situation is the worst thing about this place now. Now you can only park ONE of your cars in your parking spot and if you have another car then you get a pass to park it in the basement. Soooo... This is supposed to be "better" but it's a pain in the butt for the residents. With the price we pay for the apartment we should be able to park whichever car we want in OUR PARKING spot. Whether it be a guest of ours or any one of our cars. Main Street need to fix their parking system to at least allow us to park either one of our cars in our parking spot.
So some pros,
The apartment is pretty big and has a spacious bathroom. The electricity bill is pretty low since there is a Nest system and there are gas stoves.

All in all though, not worth the high price and having so many rules. You know your neighbors can hear you talking through the halls because you can hear people when they're walking through the halls.
Another con, they have a loud fire alarm that is impossible to shut off.</Review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>First, you need to know the conclusion : never even think about to move to this place! I'll tell you why :

I moved here in 2017, at that moment, the reason why I choose here I'd because of its good parking rules. But now I have to say everything I'd getting horrible for this property. Equipment are getting old but price in getting higher, the new management company destroyed the Cinema at the leasing office,  told their residents the main elevator is broken but never tried to repair it, now the elevator already stopped working for more than two weeks.

Another horrible thing : image you will need to meet more than 20 speed bumps every time you tried to get in or out of the parking structure, they just built ridiculous amount of speed bumps last year without taking care of some more emergency things like the elevator. If you come home late (after 7PM most of time ), passed 12 bumps and tried to find a spot in underground level, trust me, it's not possible. Then you will have to face more than 30 bumps and drive your car to 5th floor.
While the Lincoln Property is still the managing this place, the parking is free to us and there is always empty spot on the underground level. Now, they are charging you $75 per month without even give you a spot.
They have few spots marked as LEV parking, but if you drive a car that has LEV or even ULEV emission standard, they will never give you the permit to be able parking in those spaces because they think your car is "performance car", there's no way for those car meet LEV standard.</Text></record>

<Review>I'm not recommending this apartment community at all. The parking situation is awful and for a two bedroom apartment you get only one permit and if you park in LEV/DEV or leasing area, they'll tow your car in your own living community. My car got towed in LEV/DEV (I had permit but forgot to hang it) and I had to pay the charge to take out my car from towing company. The service is really disappointing too, I had a request to unclogged my bathroom drain pipe and after a week no one showed up and I had to call again and again! The gym is dirty and the A/C doesn't work most of the times. With this price there are too many options around this area to look for a new apartment and better community.< /Review>< pictures>

Very nice property. Clean and well maintained. Friendly staff. My favorite part is the onsite gym located outside on the top of the parking structure. Coach Carolyn has over 20 years of experience and is one of the best caches I've met. I also love the monthly Pine Table events in the clubhouse where I get to learn about healthy cooking, try out delicious food and meet new people. I think having an onsite access to a senior fitness coach and health oriented community events really add to the appeal of the place.<//review>

I moved from Portland and been in Irvine for almost 2 months. I thought I might lose that community life style, but to my surprise MSV reflects that community feel. Warm feelings everywhere from the office staff to the maintenance. In general everybody who lives here is very respectful and friendly. Last but not least, I love all the residents events. I wish I can attend all of them like the last one, for example, I was very pleased with Carolyn's Pine Table and Oil & Beyond. They did an olive oil tasting. Not an average resident event. I am glad to call MSV my home.</Text>

<review>I agree with recent bad reviews. I have been living in this building for 6.5 years already and the property management has been changed twice since then and each time they brought a worse one. It used to be a very clean building with lots of events and activity and nice and understanding staff that you loved them. Now, it seems they make any effort to push you out as perhaps they can rent the unit with higher price. Prices has gone up like rockets. When I moved in back in 2012 it was cheapest and best residence in the area but now has become one of the most expensive ones with 30% increase in lease amount but 100% or more in cutting services. THE WORST THING THEY HAVE DONE RECENTLY WITHOUT ANY NOTICE WAS CHANGING PARKING STRUCTURES TO MAKE MORE MONEY OUT OF IT. They put lots of bumps (for me is 18 of them) and removed all unassigned lots to lower and upper levels in order to rent out those more convenient ones. When Legacy partners took over, they didn't have any portal available and couldn't even provide a proper invoice for a full year and it made a mess and lots of frustrations. I can keep going but I think you got the picture.<//review><Rate>3< /Rate>< userid>

<Review>The best part of Main Street Village is Carolyn's Gym.  The gym set-up is so unique, it is on the roof so you get amazing workouts with an awesome sunset (or sunrise depending on when you work out):)  I love that MSV partners with Carolyn because not only do they have the awesome rooftop gym, but Carolyn also does events for Carolyn's Pine Table, which is the foodie side.  All together Carolyn's Gym, Carolyn's Pine Table, and MSV have helped me gain a more healthy and positive lifestyle!!  Thank you!!!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

This was used to be such a nice place, friendly, quite and secure.
Now the leasing office staff completely changed and it all about getting new residents. They probably figure they make more money if residents do not extent their lease since they can get more than the 5% increase they already apply.

There is no communication or planning in advance. You will get an email the day before they close the gym for a week for constructions, just to get a second email a week later that constructions are taking longer and the gym will not open the next day.

The same for resident events, or lets call them leasing staff events where residents are allowed to come if they are flexible in time. The email will come the day of or the night before. I never have seen such a disorganized leasing office.
And they will not make that up in being friendly or helpful.

They are difficult to reach via phone or even email. Then you take your lunch time to drive there for a simple question and when you are about to go into the leasing office you get told (not in a nice way) that you can only park here if you are a future resident. Not a hallo or how can we help or even just a friendly reminder to make it quick. This when the other parking spots are open and the person turns out to be the manager of residents relations, what a good fit (irony). Especially since he had parked in the disability spot for future residents.

There is a lot to complain about this place and the leasing officr but to end this long post.

The maintenance staff is awsome. Very helpful, polite, quick and resourceful. Very impressed and happy with them.< /Text>

I really loved living in MSV. When I moved in, leasing process was very comfortable, and living there was very good experience for me.
Parking was little uncomfortable for some, but I was on 3rd floor, so I was good. Service team was great too. They used to resolve issues on the same day.
Due to my job, I had to move out with a lease break, and the leasing team asked me for Rent responsible since there were 2.5 months remaining on my lease and told me that based on their involvement with new customers, my apt will lease out early. I paid for a month which also came back. I got the statement next week, with a refund check within 10 days of new resident move in.
They didn't charge anything extra, just basic cleaning/paint/carpet cleaning.
If I ever come back to Irvine, no way I am moving to a new place. Will always go for MSV.<//Text>

<name>Chris McCartney< /name><time>1343674548602<//time><Rate>2</Rate><Review>Do not even think of moving here. This place is more like Stalag  Main St..

First the parking. New polices in June 2012. You will be towed under the following conditions.

“Vehicles parked in the same space for more than three (3) days will be considered stored and towed at the owner’s expense”

This means that a 3 day weekend = TOWED. The policies also state

They now will give out citations for anything they deem failure to follow policy.
2-citations = TOWED

Park out front to go to the main office or get your mail = TOWED

"creating a safety hazard in any way" = TOWED. Don't ask me what this means.

“Vehicles tagged for towing will have 30 minutes to relocate their vehicle before being towed at the owner’s expense.”

What they do not say is that they will NOT notify you that your car is tagged.

If you park your rent a car  in your spot, YOU WILL BE TOWED

Now, if someone parks in your space illegally. Call the office and they will tell you, "We can do nothing, you must call a towing company."

Many tenants have been towed multiple times.

Concerning the pool areas. The security guards at the pools have stopped kids from throwing small footballs and have made them take all flotation devices out of pool, regardless of how many people are in the pool.

If you are looking at moving in to Stalag Main St. Ask to see "Parking Policies" and MVS Rules and Regulations, as they will not inform you and NONE of these polices are in the lease or related materials</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>This place completely shatters my perception of an apartment community. They call it Luxury Apartments and that's an understatement; it feels more like resort-style living. As a bachelor, I wanted to live close to the action. South County is boring, North County is not my cup of tea, but there's this wonderful little area where Costa Mesa, Tustin, Newport Beach and Lake Forest connect to Irvine. Its a fantastic little pocket where you're essentially close to anything a fun-loving young adult would want to do. Clubs, bars, beaches, hiking trails, parks, late night eating, Disneyland (yes, I love Disneyland), fine dining, good shopping ad more. As they say in these shrimp places, the Whole Shabang!

Main Street Village is the perfect place in the perfect area.

Let's start with the surroundings. I can walk to Diamond Jamboree for my Asian fix, I can Uber to the bars in Santa Ana or Costa Mesa for $8 (why drink and drive?), I can walk to Ralphs, the park, a running trail. I'm across the street from the Hotel Irvine Bar (great place to pick up tourists). I walk across the street to pick up my Dry Cleaning or grab a quick bite. Usually in Irvine the residential areas are very secluded from everything else. I used to live in Woodbridge and you would have to drive EVERYWHERE. Even the 7-11 was a mission! Main Street Village offers the convenience of being close to everything, whether you're on foot, in car or Uber'ing it.

Now about the apartment itself. The gym is the real deal. Big, nice, tons of equipment, TV's everywhere, courtesy disinfecting wipes. Plus it's never crowded (and I've been at nearly every time you would go). It's 24 hours too. I canceled my gym membership because I had no need to ever leave my place. I just wish they had a barbel. But whatever.

Amenities. The theater is something out of James Cameron's house. They have a yoga-type studio, two clubhouses which are amazing! Pool tables, foosball, TV, kitchen-- the whole works. They also have community events like pizza parties, pancake breakfasts, group walks, etc. Which is a really nice perk.

They have two pools-- one resort style pool and one lap pool. Two jacuzzis and several 24 hour fire places with comfortable seats. Many gas BBQ's, a hammock, some cool future-inspired sitting pod, a place for dogs and a children's play area. And I want to mention there isn't very many kids. I see the same 7 kids all the time.

Neighbors. My neighbors are very cool. I've already made lots of friends and it's great getting drunk with a friend and being able to walk around the corner back to my home. Also, my neighbors seem to be super rich. I've seen Lamborghini's, Bentley's, Corvettes, high-end Mercedes' and others. And you don't need to be rich to live here (trust me).

The staff is great. Always helpful and always friendly. In past apartments I found the staff only to be nice until you move in then I feel they lose interest in you because they'e already "closed you." But certainly not here. The staff feel more like the concierge of a hotel then "leasing agents." They accept packages for me, give me free cookies and coffee, and genuinely make me feel welcomed. Naz, Gary, September and Jessica have been the ones I've worked with and they are all amazing.

My apartment is certainly high end. Granite countertops. High ceilings. Great master bath. Washer and dryer in unit. Nice patio. They even give you free cleaning supplies and will change your light bulbs. Plus there's this community portal (website) where people post things they have for sale or services they offer. It really gives meaning to the word "community."

The city of Irvine often claim they're a great place to live but the irony is the best place in Irvine is not owned by the Irvine Company. Ha! See you by the pool. :)</text>< Pictures>

I've been living in the Main Street Village since Dec 2016 and I made a big mistake choosing this community for my home. The parking situation is terrible and you get only one parking for a two bedroom apartment. The elevator doesn't work at least one week every month. The pools are very dirty and there's no maintenance. Old kitchen appliance and most of them were not working properly when we moved in. The fitness area is very dirty and the machines are old and the AC doesn't work. It gets so hot during summer that you cannot even train. If you complain to the  leasing office they simply ignore it or it takes them a couple of  months to take care of the issue. Don't recommend this place at all.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) They rent very comfortable apartments and you can enjoy the gym, swimming pools, jacussi, or a grill in their zaadores.

I actually had a covid test done on the same day after this appointment, (came back negative) and it came back before the strep results did. I was told to call lake Elsinore for results the next day since the murrieta office is closed until Monday, The receptionist at lake Elsinore stated to start medicine right away and the doctor I had spoken to had no idea what she was talking about, there are even quick swabs that come back immediately for strep and they claim not to have those. It is “Urgent care” for a reason, nothing about this has any urgency whatsoever. Horrible customer service in their lake Elsinore location, as she did not seem to even care and was giving me conflicting advice from what the doctor said. I will be going elsewhere next time.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I was able to get an appointment right away. The waiting room was empty and we were able to see a PA within 10 minutes of arrival.  Everything was clean and sanitary.  The PA who saw my granddaughter was pleasant and very through.  She explained everything so my granddaughter understood what she had to do to get better.  We will be coming back when we need to see someone ASAP.<//Review>

I would actually give the medical assistants and secretaries 5 stars. The PA was average maybe 3.5 stars. The reason for 2 stars is I showed up around 920. Didn't get put into a room until 1030 and PA came in around 1045. Sign in was all contact less done over an iPad and my phone. No one was in the waiting room. I left at 1130. No sense of urgency. I dont understand why it took so long. I'm an er nurse and used to fast paced environments.  We try to see people has quickly as possible on slow and busy days. I have pneumonia so the last thing I want is to wait when I was the only patient. Then, they don't have xrays so I had to go somewhere else for that, which is fine. Also, no COVID testing. They tried to tell me to go to lake Elsinore and I'd have to pay $125 for it because they don't take any insurance for covid tests. I went to CVS down the street and had a covid test done for free. Just glad I know where to find the resources I needed, but not sure if the average person would.I dont know if I would return or not. Still waiting for my xray results.<//Review>

The provider was okay but didn't seem very knowledgeable with what was going on about my back and bilateral ridiculopathy. She prescribed Flexeril which hinders and interaction with Prozac. I talked to the pharmacist and I'm just not going to fill it so I don't even know why she would give me that if there was that kind of interaction because I know that all my other medications don't have that. I wish Dr Powell was there<//Text>

I love total care however is my second time with this nurse and the second time I had to leave the room, she is a non comprehensive nurse and looks like she is on hurry to let you go, and of course when you go there is because you are not ok or in the mood, not because you love to be there I don’t feel confident with her . However  Ross and dr Powell are a really good professional and compasiva person</text>

The office staff went out of their way to get special authorization from my insurance so that I could be seen as they don't normally take my insurance. The medical staff was very professional and courteous. I was also lucky that I only had to wait about 10 min. to be seen once they got the authorization (I waited at home and they called me once they had authorized my insurance. I live near by so I went straight over and they got me right in) I would definately return if needed and send family and friends their way aswell.</text>

<review>I appreciate the information I learned from the medical assistant and the PA about my medical complaint. It really relieved my fears and worries. The appointment didn’t take long at all even though there were three people ahead of me. I’m thankful for the treatment.</review>< pictures>

I've seen both the PA and the doctor. Always an excellent experience while helping me feel better.  I'm very picky about my health care.  I never worry going there.<//text>

Nice is not enough. Good service is also being adequate and quality service. How this place got 3 stars? I don't know. I'm sure it's probably their employees who write those reviews.
Stop! Don't go here.<//Review>

Wouldn't give any stars.  There is never anyone in the facility and yet you still wait almost 45 to an hour in the lobby to be called back just to wait a half hour more. Never see the doctor only the PA. PA did a half a** job during my check up. I complained of an ear ache and sore throat of which I thought was potential strepp. She did not use a tongue depressor and just shined the light into my mouth and said nope looks fine. Yet, my throat had the tell tale obvious signs of strepp. She barely checked my ears and sent me on my way. If I did not adamantly and aggressively insist she write me a prescription for antibiotics, she was not going to give me anything.< /Text>

We went there on 1/15 and it took 3 hours to be seen. They took some people behind us so they wouldn't have to wait because I had 4 to be seen. It wasn't that busy to take that long. Then they were supposed to fax something to the pharamacy and their was a error code but no one followed up so when I went to pick up the drugs they weren't ready and I had to call urgernt care to then have them call it in. They are so lame there don't wast your time!!!!!!!<//Text>

WORST PLACE EVER!  You will wait a long time.  You will see a nurse practitioner instead of a doctor.  The nurse practitioner will be sub par even as nurse practitioner's go.< /Review>

Wide variety of product's with overall excellent prices. In the last year prices at my 2 local supermarket's have been steadily going up so I thought I would give WinCo a try. I saved a lot of money today. And since you have to bag your own groceries I was able to use my bags, didn't have to do it in the parking lot. I do wish WinCo had more organic fruit, veggies and other products. Will definitely be going back even though it is further away.<//Text>

Store is clean, large, large selection, deli is awesome as well. Right now there is plenty of paper products and there is a limit of 2 packs per customer on Toilet paper. That is a plus in my book! Being that everyone bought out the country a few months back! Thank you WinCo!! This is my store that I prefer to shop at!

Love the name brand items and the low prices. WinCo is more inexpensive that Walmart. And they are a complete grocery store with many choices. Not like Food Max or Food Co with a limited selection.</review>

Some aisle were blocked preventing your cart getting through.  Shelves were fully stocked and was easily able to locate desired needs. Establishment appearance was mediocre.<//Text>

<Review>Staff in customer services were actually very helpful. They tried to assist me but you need to make sure your debit/credit card has a chip. I was able to do my transaction at a bank atm but they did their best. I thank them for that.< /Review>< userid>

<review>Love this WinCo. Great produce section, great, cheese selection, awesome bulk department, good meats. I also love their ethnic (Mexican) selection and their healthy/organic options in some spots. Also, so cheap. Love shopping here. Wish it was slightly closer to me.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>This location seems small or the people were just rude. Idk either way I probably won't be back to that location unless  neccessary. Even the seafood clerk customer service was dry. I spoke he looked like he seen a ghost. Try to lighten his day with some jokes and small talk and he did not even talk back. Awkward as fk but it's no surprise being in that area. I said what I said.< /review><gmap_id>0x809b2747b46e7ae3:0xe980ed69977e5f3< /gmap_id>< UserId.>

Best time to shop is early morning before 10:00 a.m. or a Friday night after 7:00 pm. Not many humans around.. This is the cleanest Winco I have been in.</Text>

We love this place, good prices, bulk items, quality fresh fruit and veggies make it a great place to do most of our grocery shopping! A big selection in all departments makes this a great store to shop at anytime you need to get your groceries too.<//review>

<Review>Considering it's Christmas Eve, the store wasn't too bad. People were friendly and all were wearing masks. 😀  The 6ft distancing was awesome at checkout. The cashier was super nice and no one was crowding or rushing me in line. I love Winco...and was very impressed with how today went.< /Review>< gmapID>

Winco has Its fair share of good mood employees that are a joy to talk to and take time to show good service to customers and then you just have the don’t want to be there can’t handle customers and hate questions employees.

Considering it's Christmas Eve, the store wasn't too bad. People were friendly and all were wearing masks. 😀  The 6ft distancing was awesome at checkout. The cashier was super nice and no one was crowding or rushing me in line. I love Winco...and was very impressed with how today went.<//review>

No one on floor maintaining shelves many isles in disarray. Even in produce but this store is busy . i was not happy w selection limited brands i buy baking potatoes they were not up to par visibly misshapen not big enough prices were great value even the sales are great honey ham was .98 cents today meat also great value but u will not see a lot of organic items but  not enough but this store is for the budget shopper. It has low prices. It is not safe way type store although they have bakery deli n flowers .. Cashier was very friendly you bag your own groceries also</review>

Their crew need to learn how to keep isle clear of thrown boxes. If the store is going to remain open to the public they should have better housekeeping. Maybe have an apprentice clear the boxes that have been thrown. This will prevent accidents and possible law suits.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Exceptional customer service, in the wee hours of the morning.  Cootoes to Kylie P, Cashier who helped me.  These days, some people don't appreciate the employment they have, this lady appreciates her job.  Kylie thanks for your awesome customer service, may God bless you and your loved ones.< /text>

Winco is one of my favorite stores to shop.. The one on Elverta Rd is open 24hrs a day and has a large selection of fresh produce, poultry, pork, beef and seafood.. The bakery always has yummy cakes, doughnuts and bread baked daily and displayed for easy access. The stores layout gives you plenty of room to browse with your cart and if you want something already cooked and hot then check out what the deli has.. Sometimes theres a line in checkout so when i only have a couple things I find the self checkout fast and easy to use.. Ive always had good shopping at winco and being employee owned with friendly helpful people i give 5 stars to you.. Thankyou</review>

My favorite thing about WINCO is the store hours which enables me to shop at my convenience. The store located in Antelope have a wonderful group of people working the graveyard shift. They are friendly and very helpful.They take pride in their work and despite that they are busy restocking they maintain a very clean environment for me to shop in.< /Review>

When I went to wasn't too crowded, and they had a lot of check stands open, so the line moved quick. And the checker was super friendly and helpful. The only thing I could complain about would be that they have some items in weird places. There was cereal in the produce, and cleaning stuff by the frozen food. But there was an actual aisle for those things, so a little confusing.< /text>< Pictures>

I don’t review Much but I just moved to antelope and I experience the best customer service from this grocery store but mainly from one employee, her name is Que. When my wife and I come in, she’s helpful, engaging and welcoming. She’s constantly working hard but most she’s nice and hardworking. Thank you Que for your service< /Review>

I had to change my rating from 4 to 1 after my last two visits.
This store does not enforce their mask wearing policy. They have the signage, PPE, and staff at the entrance yet people walk in with no mask on. Not just a person or two. My last trip I counted 45 different customers not wearing a mask or wearing it down around their chin or mouth.

As in these times I do not want to travel all over for groceries, I will continue to shop here but if I have a cart load of goods and I encounter many people not wearing masks and employees not enforcing, I may be forced to leave my cart of items behind and leave the store.

I will update my review if the store makes changes.<//Review>

I have been going to this location for 10 years. Everyone that works there has always been super nice, knowledgeable, and makes shopping there even better. The prices are the cheapest I've seen anywhere.  I hope the antelope location stays open for many years to come.<//Review>

<text>Q is by far winco's best employee and she works in produce. Dont get me wrong theres other nice employees that ive encountered but there customer service isnt consistent...

another pro is that winco is cheap and you will find items here at this location that other locations dont have</text>< Pictures>

<review>Toilet paper now well stocked, no sign limiting TP purchase (who need more than two packs?).  Not too crowded at 4:30PM on a Tuesday. Better to shop at in early AM. Overall, not bad at Winco.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>Been shopping here a couple times a week for about 7 years now.. Never had a bad experience with any of the store associates. Shelves are pretty much always stocked.

I did think it a bit silly how they were requiring people to stand in line outside during this covid ordeal.. but to each their own.

Overall, this is the only place I do my grocery shopping.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>10 shoppers without masks, 2 store employees without masks. Management could fix by establishing a policy of NO MASK, NO CHECKOUT. Just like a restaurant,  no shoes, no shirt,  no service. Just my opinion.<//text><rate>1</rate>< username>

Went today to shop for groceries picked up a California sushi roll to eat on the way home. Was so upset to find out that each one I bit into had some sort of plastic rapper inside of them. Called the store to let them know didn’t seem like they cared much!</Text>

<review>Usually have quality and seasonal foods. Their website is a lovely little place for recipe ideas. Managers are relatively nice. Just don't accidentally steal anything. It bites you in the a** 3000%. Floor and deli employees are fairly friendly and helpful. They don't accept VISA or other forms of credit cards so cash or Debit only. Always expect a wait or for it to be busy. From 6am-2am. I'm pretty sure they're open 24 hours a day, but their deli section closes early, like 8pm. Mostly focuses on food but have aisles for some home, self, and pet essentials. Also have a bakery. And hands down the best fried chicken-- even better than chicken exclusive restaurants out there. Don't ever alter the recipe please!< /review>< rate>

Had a terrible experience today. I tripped over the pallet that the watermelon were on, since the edge is just hanging out I let one of the employees know he told his supervisor and said to go to customer service. Went. Had to wait like 10 min. All the guy said was "they come like that" "what do you want me to do" that's it. He didn't bother swing how I was or apologize or anything . That was unexpectable .</review>

Store "claims" to have mask policy but they are NOT enforcing it...many people walked right in with no mask on and never questioned or they would have it down under their chin..one gentlemen in particular had no mask and sneezed in the vegetables< /text>

< review>
The parking lot was really dirty. There was a lady yelling and cussing at an disabled employee cause he misunderstood about ice. She started yelling really nasty names and when she finally was leaving she still toke her car yelling profanities and slurs and this employee. I rathet drive and extra 30 mins to go to orangevale or even roseville not to deal with people like that.< /review>

< Review>
Very upset at what I saw at winco today. Im in line at 6am and the line was down to Orchard Supply used to be. Limited to2 paper products, I understand as hoarders created this. Chapped my hide to see an employee with at least 10 paper products. Big 24 packs of northern toilet paper and mega good paper towels. We are all left with the cheap stuff and limited. I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt like this. It is WRONG!< /Review>

<text>The lady in winco with the braids is nice and knows how to pick out strawberries 🍓 I come here at least twice a month when I’m at my property and I’m always greeted and I save a lot of money than shopping at raleys. They have a sushi 🍣 spot and the guy and ladies are nice they will make me a roll with or without ingredients . They don’t accept credit that will be the only problem I have with winco< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I came early this morning because it’s not too busy and the girl who works in produce named que is so awesome!!! She was friendly and greeted me first I don’t know how she pushes that cart but clearly she’s hardworking, perfect person  to have right when you walk in. the cashier Ron was super cool to and he has a good positive attitude to be early morning I just love winco!!< /Review>

Your employee Rose apparently opened up a register just before 1 am today to let her personal friend skip the at the time one backed up register. I wouldn't even been bothered by it if she'd stayed open to handle us being told to hop over to her register by the cashier we were waiting on but no, she was just gonna help the guy in the black t-shirt and dip on everyone.</Text>

First of all this is an employee owned and operated chain. Headquarters are in Washington State . Overall prices and quality are supior to all the competitors. The produce is usually fresh and cleaned. The bulk food section is enormous. The meat department has service available. The frozen foods and dairy cases are competitively priced. Dry goods and cleaning products are also lowest price. Cash and ATM acceptable but no credit cards.<//review>

The bulk section in the back can be a real money saver and dozens of low cost alternatives. With a wide variety of food,produce, and brands to choose from, it'll be hard not to be pleased here. The checkout lines can be awfully packed, there are self checkout machines available for the smaller quantity shoppers.</review><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809b2747b46e7ae3:0xe980ed69977e5f3</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great prices and almost everything you need. You bag yourself, but that's where all the savings come from. No flowers, no stunning pastry, or meat department either. For the bulk of your household groceries shop here.<//Review>

More often than not they have everything I'm looking for and then some. They have shelf labels to help identify gluten free products which is helpful when you don't have time to read the label on every product in the aisle.  Usually pretty busy, but it seems like the lines move fast enough that it's no big deal.  I will mention that the parking lot can be crazy at times but I just take a spot in the back and walk past all the commotion.< /Text>

You can't beat the prices here. They're almost always busy, but customer service is pretty good overall.
On one occasion I was having a tough time with my two little ones and a manger took notice, so she offered to help bag and walk me to my car. It was such a kind gesture.
Another occasion, I was pregnant and needed help bagging some items, so I asked and they helped without hesitation.
Late-night is always the least crowded, but that's when they stock, so the aisles are a little tough to maneuver around the pallets of food and such.</Text>

Great prices for the quality and quantity of the product. Use the bins for bulk foods so its cheaper for you. A good day to go is a Wednesday at 8 or 9 pm. I recommend 9. Not very many people there at that time. Very nice customer service and quick lines. Self check out is available. Great for regular grocery shopping store.< /review>

Winco used to be good. Their bakery is lacking, bought garlic bread and there was no garlic on the bread. They no longer carry the chewy rolls we buy every visit. Other than that their prices are reasonable.< /Text>

Decent prices. Product line is limited to the most in demand selections of popular brands and some house brand items. Anything less popular will have to be obtained elsewhere.</review>

Their general goods are reasonably priced as well as everything else in the store. The meat quality is not anywhere near great, though I have had worse. Always a really long line to get through checkout as well< /Review>

I still am amazed at the amount of food encluding 3 large package of meat. 2 beef and 1 chicken that I bought.  So if you don't mind bagging your own groceries this is the place to go if you want to bring home lots of groceries for your money.  WinCo's name brand products that I've tried are all items I will buy again. They have all been as good as the name brand products I've bought in the past.  Thanks WinCo for giving us the prices back from the 70's.</Text>

Absolutely love this place. Hands down my favorite thing about the store would have to be the bulk section. You can get as little or as much of something as you need . Just about all items are cheaper than competitors and staff is  pretty friendly. I like to come really late or really early when it’s not soo busy so the fact that they are open 24 hours is awesome! The cashier Ron is a sweetheart always polite and patient as well as the young lady Que. You can tell when employees are happy with their job, it definitely shows. The only downside would be the fact that they don’t accept credit, but they make up for it with the super low prices. Winco is my go to store.<//Review>

<text>Many of the fruit and veggies are usually under ripe. The layout is pretty easy to navigate and find what you're looking for (for most things). They have a surprising selection of vegan, gluten free, and other specialty diet options that cater to the diverse crowds that shop here. It's cheap, and have only had trouble with one employee being rude in the several years I have been shopping here.< /text><Response>None<//Response><user>110694537399380079806</user></record>

<Text>Incredible values despite the somewhat unkempt parking lot. It really isn't their fault it is just a condition of the neighborhood. Seeing people throwing trash out of their cars into the parking lot when there is a trash can 20 feet away tells you a lot about the people frequenting this establishment. Other than that better deals can not be had anywhere else.< /Text>< Pictures>

Early this morning, around 2:30am, my boyfriend and I went to this location to buy formula since we ran out. We asked for Enfamil Gentlease. The woman that was called to get it brought Gentlease Neuro Pro. My boyfriend and I spoke up that we thought it wasn't the right kind. The lady said "It's the only Gentlease we have". At this point we are very tired and accept that we might be wrong. The woman rings us up, name on receipt is Mary R.. We get home after 3am and sure enough, the formula is wrong. At this point it is too dangerous to drive due to being sleep deprived, so my baby had to have water instead. We go in today to exchange the formula for the correct kind, which was right there at customer service, and we are told it is illegal to return the unopened formula even with the receipt. So because Mary R. didnt want to go back and check for the correct kind of formula, we are out money and time wasted...</Text>

<Text>You can't beat the prices here. They're almost always busy, but customer service is pretty good overall.
On one occasion I was having a tough time with my two little ones and a manger took notice, so she offered to help bag and walk me to my car. It was such a kind gesture.
Another occasion, I was pregnant and needed help bagging some items, so I asked and they helped without hesitation.
Late-night is always the least crowded, but that's when they stock, so the aisles are a little tough to maneuver around the pallets of food and such.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x809b2747b46e7ae3:0xe980ed69977e5f3<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>just moved to Antelope and im new to the area...came in this morning and glad I did, there was a lady in produce who was holding it down named Que, knowledgeable and I can tell she takes pride in her produce area..I feel like wincos produce and products are cheaper and at the same caliber as safeyway, raleys and any other grocery store. Wish there organic section was bigger, but glad they had it. Bulk section is great and overall throughout the whole store, customer service was exceeding all expectations< /review>< Pics>

Out in antelope for work, glad I found this place. Affordable prices for everything, cheaper than the other stores for sure. All the employees asked me if i found everything okay, which is great because Im a customer service type of man. Produce options were great, had a good amount of organic options, The lady Que is very helpful. She knew what fruit I was looking for even though Winco dosent carry it, but not a lot of people know what this fruit is ( mangosteen ) she was able to tell me they didnt have it and where I can find it. Very smart girl<//review>

Gotta Love Winco! The employees are without fail both friendly and helpful.  I appreciate the low prices and also appreciate the new self-check registers.  The atmosphere is bright and clean. The selection is pretty good and quality is good.  The bulk foods section is a real help since I can buy only as much as I need. I have to recommend this grocery store.</Text>

Go to place for food staples at  reasonable prices.  It is a self bag grocery store.  The fresh fruits are "iffy" at times dependent upon day of the week.  Selective shopping here will save money on your monthly food bill.< /Text>

<Text>Has a great selection of both family size and bulk items in grocery dept. with a variety of items on sale or at membership store prices, good produce and meat dept., large store is easy to navigate and reach items, many checkers and clerks available so easy to find help and lines are usually short and fast moving. Security is in store as well as patrolling parking lot so safety and security are not an issue. Overall a pleasant shopping experience and one I recommend to anyone needing one item or a cart full. 4.5 stars out of 5 ( -0.5 for cleanliness as it can be a bit sloppy when really busy.)<//Text>< pics>

<text>Greatest grocery store on the planet. Not sure about other planets.. But when visiting earth, visit winco for all your food needs. Great or comparable prices on everything.

An hour goes by I realize I’m very ill. I had food poisoning he entire day at work and that soup was the only thing I ate in two days. I am very upset! This store needs to be investigated!

I don’t know how she can do produce but I admire her work ethic because it looks tough. She’s always smiling and asking if I found everything okay . She definitely deserves a raise winco!!!!</Review>< pictures>

Prices are great! But there were no shopping carts. Waited half hour for chicken. (The staff was great, but the looked over worked). Then waited 45 minutes in line to check out. Never again!!! I am sure it's not the staff they worked fast, but wayyy to many customers< /Review>

I can always count on this place to be open late since they are 24 hours but if you come late don't be amazed when only one cashier is working and you have a long line. Even despite the long line and wait I am happy a place like this is open reliably so it get's a five stars from me.<//Review>

<time>1555442538678<//time><text>although non Union store,  can't beat their prices. I hate seeing unions not in play. But the bulk section and the prices lower than Walmart which is also non-union can't be beat by Union stores. A lot other work is non-union. At least I'm supporting a locally employee-owned store they say... but this is a One Stop store for the most part. Then stop @ wallyworld for the few thing cheaper there. It's difficult being low income.</text><UserId.>109159551485706291758< /UserId.><Name>Dee W< /Name><Response>None</Response><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

The staff is helpful ...meat ..canned goods..beverages...dairy...and frozen products are great. My only concern complaint is to step it up on the produce...theirs usually fruit flies around it because things are going bad. Clean store
Great staff. Quick check out... It's mostsly just the produce.that needs work. Otherwise I love WinCo and always have ❤️< /Text><user_id>111129499097800177590</user_id><user_name>Trevonne Owens<//user_name>< gmapID>

I bought glazed donuts from this store some time ago. The donuts melted in my mouth. The donuts were light tasting and had a good flavor. Glazed on both sides of the donuts. Today I bought the glazed donuts, they were thick with no flavor, glazed only on one side. I will not be purchasing glazed donuts from this store anymore. I like this store, its clean, the prices are great, and friendly workers.</text>

So I get winco's chicken wings atleast twice a week, but this experience ruined it all for me. Atleast half of the wings had feathers...yeah chicken feathers on them. My appetite was ruined for the entire day, I nearly vomited the moment I opened the box. Never eating their wings again. Yuck! I understand that they have different employees for different duties, but this just shows how accurate and clean their food prep is.< /Text>

Love WinCo. They can keep prices low since they don't have to pay credit card companies (cash/debit only) and you bag your own groceries. I have a habit of asking employees about the work environment and without fail they all say it's fantastic since it really is an employee-owned company.</review>

<Text>Stopped by for a few things at midnight, (I work nights so I love the 24 hour) and couldn't find corn. I asked the guy stocking if they had any and he cheerfully went to the back and grabbed me some. This was June 9th-10th at midnight and I think he was a redhead. Hope he gets good props for great customer service.</Text>< Pics>

You should know of their hitla tactics. They stock stuff at distribution centers right? It's their stuff there no other way. They order it. I was one of the people who took their load to deliver to them. Normally this is a favor you do to whomever hired you even though you are getting reasonably paid. Guess what when i delivered, I was denied an unload for free. It's their stuff I should not pay for them unloading it. They forced me pay for unload. And very very steep money... I was broken why did I take their load to deliver? If I pay this unload fee what's left for my family..? I have a pallet jack, I was willing to unload it. Guess what they prohibited me from entering the warehouse and denied any trying to unload it. I was forced to pay the fee for them unloading it that decimated my income. Shady elusive liar company, unfair and dishonest,  does it in a way groceries consumer not to know. Shame, shame, shame< /Text>

<text>This store is very busy during daytime hours. The wait at registers can be 15 minutes some days. Not for lack of cashiers, but amount of groceries people buy. Good prices and selection is what causes overflowing baskets in turn making checkout a lengthy process.
Come here in off hours if possible. Be careful of store re-stockers. They're busy, but always glad to help you find products you can't find.
Would be 5 stars if the checkout wasn't always packed with 10-15 minute wait times.< /text>< pictures>

Two guys were really nice. The cashier all but ignored me. Produce is cheaper, but the strawberries are terrible and have left a bad taste in my mouth. Haven't tried the rest of my fruit cuz it's not ripe. Lines are long and slow. Usually avoid this place and not sure I'll be back<//Text>

<text>Stopped by for a few things at midnight, (I work nights so I love the 24 hour) and couldn't find corn. I asked the guy stocking if they had any and he cheerfully went to the back and grabbed me some. This was June 9th-10th at midnight and I think he was a redhead. Hope he gets good props for great customer service.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x809b2747b46e7ae3:0xe980ed69977e5f3</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I am going through some hard times financially and so I had to return some things. She just gave me total attitude. The manager had to come and assist. He was polite. This was my first time going to this location and will be my last. I will not spend my hard earned money on a place ungrateful for it. She even greeted the baby next to us with a smile and gave us nothing but a frown the entire time.<//Review><GmapID>0x809b2747b46e7ae3:0xe980ed69977e5f3< /GmapID>< Resp>

You should know of their hitla tactics. They stock stuff at distribution centers right? It's their stuff there no other way. They order it. I was one of the people who took their load to deliver to them. Normally this is a favor you do to whomever hired you even though you are getting reasonably paid. Guess what when i delivered, I was denied an unload for free. It's their stuff I should not pay for them unloading it. They forced me pay for unload. And very very steep money... I was broken why did I take their load to deliver? If I pay this unload fee what's left for my family..? I have a pallet jack, I was willing to unload it. Guess what they prohibited me from entering the warehouse and denied any trying to unload it. I was forced to pay the fee for them unloading it that decimated my income. Shady elusive liar company, unfair and dishonest,  does it in a way groceries consumer not to know. Shame, shame, shame<//text>

We like Winco for the produce and some meat products. Lately we have thought about going somewhere else because we are always stuck behind someone that is using Wic coupons. It is so frustrating because they take forever, once even going back for different cereals that were acceptable. My ice cream melted. Can there be a line for people that use WIC? Come on, this is ridiculous.</text>

<review>I use the lazy Shopper to help me get around as I have trouble walking. It was so cold in that store that it put my body in pain. I was freezing. Also a lot of the things I needed to buy where on the top of the shelves and I can't reach them. It gets tiring always asking somebody to reach that for me so I just don't buy it.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I have been shopping WinCo since 2003, it has gone from a great store to a store that I don't want to shop anymore! They are carrying less and less of what I buy, they are moving things around the store to places that things shouldn't go. I have to walk around more and waste time to finds things or to find out they no longer carry the item!  They seem to have trouble keeping things in stock and are too lazy to face shelves at nigt. Having to climb up on a shelf to reach something that should have been faced is not a good thing. They had a wonderful crew of people working there and only a handful of great people left working there. WinCo is a store that is supposed to be great for the community and the employees, I say they are not!</Review><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

Large store setup a little different than most of their other stores.this store has some different stuff that the other stores I've been to. The refrigerated section seemed a bit cramped for the amount of space the store has. This store has handicap parking and wheelchair accessible parking and access to the building. Public restrooms are also available I did not check to see if they were wheelchair friendly or if they had baby changing stations or not. This store also offered brown paper bags and plastic bags which I've never seen at a WinCo. The people here we're a bit more pushy and rude, meaning customers, the employees were ok nothing special stuck out about them. Oh also the parking lot was large smaller parking spaces than the other stores I've been to. This store also had hand baskets for those not needing a cart.<//Text>

<Review>I work late nights and get off at 3-4am.  I go to Winco because it is open.  Only one checkout line open and that's understandable but the guest has four carts and is couponing.  I waited and not once was another cashier called or any attempt to help me.  Poor guest service, only good prices.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809b2747b46e7ae3:0xe980ed69977e5f3<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The prices of most items (food only) are lesser than any store in the area. The staff at the Antelope store have always been friendly and great customer service.< /text>

<Text>I love winco, can't beat the prices. Anywhere. They're even cheaper than Walmart. However, the quality of people who shop there will drive you insane. Some of the most low life bottom feeders of the earth roam about at winco which can make for quite the unpleasant shopping experience. Rude, inconsiderate disgusting people who cough their tuberculosis all over you without a care. Its annoying and maddening at times but I have a large family to feed and I DO NOT get any assistance from anyone to feed them, so I shop at winco.
The employees are usually always nice and helpful. Unless you shop during the time of night when the shelves are being restocked. The pallet people come out with their forklifts and they can be ruthless. Like they're pallet crusaders with a mission to put beans on a shelf and they will stop at nothing to complete their mission, even if it means running you over. And don't even think about reaching for something when they're on that mission, they will give you the most soul crushing stank face you've ever seen. Just don't shop late at night.
Otherwise like I said, I ❤ Winco.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Winco is a great place to shop for deals. I think the main benefit over Walmart is they offer bulk bins which is nice. I like to buy Grains like Steel Cut Oats and Chia Seeds for smoothies and spices. Its the cheapest way to buy.< /Text>

<text>I came to shop here one very early morning @ around 2:30 a.m., because of the the convenience of 24 hour-hour shopping and affordability, but I was a bit disappointed when I got home, because the 1 gallon ice cream bucket was broken and the seal was tampered. I spoke to the manager, and he told me that a customer must have put it back in the freezer, but I don't think so because nobody was in the store except me, and it was shelved uniformly with the rest of the ice cream in that freezer, and no would suspect it was broken. I end up discarding that 1-gallon of contaminated ice cream and never set foot in this store again. This store lacks quality control considering the fact that the ice cream was a Winco Store Brand. You need to have a strict and careful quality product control for loyal customers to return and shop in your stores. This was not the first time, it happened several times in this branch. I have never seen any incidents like this happened in Safeway,  WalMart,  Raley's and Bel-Air Supermarkets, but only here in this Winco branch.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x809b2747b46e7ae3:0xe980ed69977e5f3</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The employees at this store actually renewed my faith in humanity! I lost my wallet on a Friday evening and live over 50 miles from Antelope. It wasn't until late that night I realized it and tried calling a couple other stores I had been to but nothing was turned in. Eight o'clock a.m. I got a call from AAA saying that my wallet was found at Winco and they had gone out of their way to connect so I could recover it. I called and set it up so my ex who lives nearby could pick it up. EVERYTHING was accounted for including over $500 cash! Not only that there was a bad storm and it was found in the parking lot drenched. They dried out everything even the money so nothing was ruined. Truly above and beyond :-) <3< /Text>

<text>I loved the store some family members worked here too. Great prices and great bulk selections. UNTIL  I had an incident where I was busy in the mix and accidentally threw a small $.99 hand sanitizer on top of my purse. And when I went and grabbed my phone  somehow fell in farther. Moral of story I got in trouble for "Stealing" & I know that i did have the right to not sign the papers & stick up to myself to the Police if they called but I had just had my 1st baby 4 days before & had really bad Post Partum Depression at that time so i did not want to deal w it. I had told Security that I would pay for it & that I genuinely did not mean to do it. but the HOLE time they were just laughing & digging through my other groceries i had boughten & making bad remarks about me. A few days later i heard from one of there employees that the Girl & Male Security were bragging about it & still laughing about the situation & making fun of me. I've shopped here since I was in Middle School. I know I personally could of handled it more strict but I had literally just had a baby & i told them that.</text>< pics>

I love WinCo there wayyyyyy better then Wal-Mart.  You get more food here with your money. Wal-Mart rips you off!  Winco is the best place to Shop for food.  Plus people are nice here and not rude.<//review>

Cheapest prices around! Almost always beats all the other stores for its prices. The place is a little old and can get crowded from all the people with its narrow aisles but its still great.</text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I spent $11.31 for two packages of "SUPREME STEW MEAT" - what I got were little itty bitty pieces, most of which was scrap meat.  Out of those two packages only 1/2 pound was decent meat - the rest was fat, tiny bits or meat that were added for weight instead of being discarded.   It was like this was the last of the meat so he just scrapped them into these two packages, put larger pieces on top and wrapped them in plastic. This is ridiculous when I am charged  $4.68 per pound for pieces that are going to disintegrate as soon as I begin cooking them.  What a disgrace -  I have been shopping at this store since it opened - and this is the first time I am disappointed in their meat.  This isn't even worth one star - but couldn't post without - this is a travesty.
One other thing...I would like to request that the lettuce be taken out of the plastic bags - the plastic causes the lettuce to sweat and be all slimy; by the time it is purchased, half of it must be thrown away - We always have to buy our lettuce elsewhere  or the pre-packaged ones.
And just so this is not a total negative - the employees (cashiers and floor personnel) are incredible - they will absolutely assist in any way possible - which is the main reason we come back to do most of our shopping.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I used to shop between 3 stores.Raley's,Walmart and Winco.Walmart for convenience and Raleys for the produce. But Walmart cut their hours(I shop crazy hours like 1am) and Raley's produce is not,in my opinion superior anymore while Winco has improved.I price compare and Winco is hands down less expensive than Raleys and a bit better,for what I buy than Walmart.Raleys has better selection Walmart is the worst for produce and selection.Winco keeps getting better and better.Long lines but it moves fast< /text>< Pictures>
