The school is specifically for people who are very focus in being a CPA or lawyer.  I came from a huge big school that has its own highway inside the campus to a small boutique school that has almost nothing. But this is where it counts, right in the middle of the financial district.  Going to class is like going to work, carrying a suitcase (at least at that time).  No partying.  Only studying.  If you want to have a good time for being young, then go somewhere else.  If you want to be a CPA and lawyer, this is the place.<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I completed my doctorate at GGU and it was an incredibly rewarding experience.  I was first drawn to the program because it was the only fully-accredited doctorate in finance in the Bay Area that could be pursued part-time by someone who also had a career. The experience proved to be so much more than that, however..  The full-time faculty who run the program are passionate about what they do, offering students the opportunity to engage in significant personal growth and deep learning. The faculty are also well suited to GGU's mission, combining, as they do, first class academic credentials with significant leadership experience in the "real world."

There are two distinct phases to doctoral study and GGU's program delivers the best of both.  The first phase is focused on core doctoral seminars that provide the tools and conceptual framework for understanding and conducting formal research. It was here that I came to fully appreciate the nature of the academic enterprise and begin to master the tools and techniques for its pursuit.

The second phase involves the development of a research question that will result (if you're sufficiently diligent) in the production of a formal dissertation.  This is the apprenticeship phase, where you work closely with your dissertation committee and, most especially, your chair.  My own committee chair, Paul Fouts, was at once both guide and mentor, sending me back again-and-again to reexamine my sources, rewrite my proposals, and revisit the evidence. Each time, my dissertation got better.  In the end, I was able to produce work that I believe will have a real impact on my profession.

The doctoral program is probably the smallest part of what GGU does, but it represents the best of the University's mission and values. Beyond that,  I can heartily recommend GGU to anyone who seeks to improve their skills and advance their career through any any of the University's many degree and certificate programs.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORHAsl9ZpOytbQTkB8VJ6eu5qPLyw5qhvTahj0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

My time here was slightly disappointed.

First, the school's credentials aren't as well recognized compared to the other schools in the area, so many students have a hard time getting a job compared to students from other schools.

Second, the school says they offer help to get students job, but all they do is review your resume and have you go out and find your own opportunities.
Third, the counselors I had for business, kept mixing me up with other students and when it came time to discuss a problem, she'd forget the issue. She also told me I didn't need a class and then said I did. After taking the class, I found out I really didn't have to and wasted an entire semester with this school.
Fourth, the resources may seem like alot at first, but the truth is, what really matters are resources for certifications. They don't have many resources that'll help and do not offer certifications for most programs.
Fifth,  the teachers and systems aren't as reliable. I find that some professors don't like it when you have questions. Some make you go to class to listen to the lecture and then still make you do an entire online course (might as well do online only). Some have a power trip and would make excuses for being late on grading or make "adjustments" to their grading on the syllabus after class is finished, messing up your entire semester. Most teachers are never up to date on their online courses. They either don't fix the dates for due dates or they don't open the assignments or just not clear on their direction.

Sixth, there are a lot of students that are international here that get discriminated against. It's very disheartening when they have to report that their teachers are saying rude remarks or making jokes about anyone of color.

Bottom line is, I regret coming here. While there were some great teachers, there weren't enough to count past one hand. Don't make the same mistake as I did. Get your money's worth elsewhere.</Review>

The LL.M. in Tax program is outstanding for lawyers wishing to specialize in tax litigation, estate planning, probate, or business taxation.  Faculty is superb and facilities are very good.  Location is ideal, especially since the Transbay Terminal is being built on the other side of Mission. Might launch an LL.M. in Estate Planning.  The LL.M in tax cost me just under $35K all-in and I completed it in 16 months</text>

I am a recent grad from U.C. Berkeley.  As an older "returning" student, it became apparent, quickly, that Cal Berkeley was not interested in my academic future and made it very clear that I was not the type they were looking for regarding graduate programs.  I reached out to GGU's faculty and staff, looking for a good fit, and professional treatment by educators who were interested in me and my future.  I have been Very pleased with and appreciative of the time, energy, helpfulness, and professionalism I have received at this school.  Highly recommend.<//review>

Education is good, but no campus life. The University is just one small building in downtown, and  most people just go to class and leave right after.<//Text>

<text>WASTE OF TIME, EFFORTS, MONEY TO ORDER OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS, AND FRUSTRATIONS 0 STAR IF THERE IS AN OPTION, if I know that I have to go through all of this for nothing, I should listen to my people around me to take the Contra Costa College for my Fall semester 2017. It is just 7 minutes drive from my home and I don't have to deal with too many unnecessary things from other schools. The only thing I disliked about CCC was the tuition is too low that I will not get much from the tax return. The BAH in my area is 3500 compared with 4200 BAH in San Francisco, which is fair overall based on a lot of factors. If I can change my mind, I would go for my first option in the first place instead of wasting my time, efforts, money, and frustrations for some other schools that did not take me anywhere. On Monday August 28, I have received the email from GGU with the subject "GGU will support you all the way - from start to graduation!" To be honest, I was almost laughed my stomach out. If GGU will support me all the way, why did they require too many unnecessary things in the first place. Just let me take some classes first, then I will submit other less important things later, but that is not how GGU wanted. That is the best support I get from GGU all the way - from start to graduation. THANKS FOR THE WARNING! That is the best email Subject I have ever received from GGU, and it came on the day that the School Starts, but I was unable to start school. I am so excited to tell you that I would like to continue my education...............somewhere else.<//text><GmapID>0x80858062df7eb43b:0x39b6f4fe79698103</GmapID>< pictures>

<Text>One of my faves when I want to go camping without a lot of hassle. There are lots of people and dogs...but in your own campsite, feels like home. No problem relaxing, rivers changing all the time, but it's always there! Nice to take ez relaxing walks along the river! Hank the host has been great with us!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x8090cb3ea39b2db3:0x5badf24ccb31ac1d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I visiting this campground every summer growing up, from before I can remember into my teens. I loved it here. The campground was always clean and quiet, with plenty of space to play and fish.  As An adult I diversified and have camped at dozens of places throughout the region.  Having gone back to this place this last week I am shocked at how down hill this place has gone. It’s crowded, with a rowdy crowd, and too much urbanization. The biggest flaw is the huge amount of flatlanders crawling all over the place, driving horrible, and walking in the middle of the road.  I give it two stars because of the memories.</text>< resp>

My friend and fishing partner had the pleasure to camp at Fraser Flat campground. The camp host was the nicest most well informed camp manager I ever had .  I will tell my camping friends our visit was the best.                 Respectfully .            KC and SG< /Review>

A hidden gem off the beaten path. No stores, showers or any extra frills  but It's absolutely gorgeous,  the river runs right through the campsite. Very relaxing. I visit Fraser flats at least 2 to 3 times a year and always look forward to the next trip.<//Text>

It was beautiful the campground host Hank keeps the bathrooms very clean.  The only problem was there was a lot of yellowjackets something no one has control over!  A group of us women have been going there every year this is first time we've had this problem.</text>

We only had one minor run in with other campers who were blasting their music with lots of bass. My husband went over and asked them to turn it down,  which they nicely did. But later in the afternoon it went back up again. Please remember to be kind to your camping neighbors. Some of us come out to get away from the city noises and it puts us in an odd position to have to confront you.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x8090cb3ea39b2db3:0x5badf24ccb31ac1d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My family has been going to Fraser Flat campground for four years and have made it a family tradition. The scenery is wonderful, great family environment. However this year, there is a new camp host, Michael who is horrible.  We handed him payment for our sight as he was making his rounds and he rudely told us he was off duty and I could drop it off in the post out front. I apologized and told him I didn't realize he would have a problem taking our money and that I didn't appreciate his tone he had with me. His response was " if you don't like it, you should find somewhere else to camp!" So we packed up and drove away as our kids cried . This man has no business working with people let alone at a family campground! There should be more attention given to the hiring of this position by Dodge Ridge.  Sadly, we won't me returning until he is no longer the camp host.</Review>< Time>

<Text>This campsite was the dirtiest we stayed at in 2+ weeks of staying in National Forest campgrounds around the western states. The bins were overflowing with smelly waste, all of the toilets were overwhelmed with flies and there was loose rubbish at almost every individual site. The whole campground smells of fish! If we hadn’t needed somewhere to stay shortly before dark, we would have gone elsewhere.< /Text>< pics>

The campground it self I have never camped in, because I am unable to drive my toy hauler into the campground.  But there are a lot of open spaces for dry camping."no hookups, water or bathrooms". Plenty of fire roads fore hiking, mountain biking, and OHV.< /review>

<Review>This is the best hamburger I’ve ever had. The pickles were perfectly crunchy on the outside. The patties were juicy and the fries exquisitely seasoned. It just, so to speak, hit different. A great spot to hit on the way to Mammoth. 6 stars<//Review>< pictures>

<review>A good greasy spoon on the way to Kernville. Good burger and onion rings. Employees were wearing masks, customers aside from us mostly were not. Small outdoor seating area. A good place for a quick bite and a side trip to see the kitschy and somewhat derelict town of Boron, CA.< /review>< Pics>

<date>1598994081522< /date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>So I’m a truck driver and today I stopped at Astro Burger because I thought why should I give my money to a chain burger place when small businesses are struggling right now especially because of everything that is going on in the world. They have about 100 items all on the wall but I just had one small request to have my burger wrapped in lettuce even just a piece of lettuce on each side is fine instead of a bun because I’m trying to watch my weight due to being a truck driver. The lady said the owner refuses to make a burger that way! My question is to the owner are you eating it are you selling it to the customers isn’t it what the customer wants to eat??? It’s unbelievable that they have 100 items but won’t do special request I won’t go there again!!!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I don't leave a lot of rewies but this one I feel like I have 2. Never had such a huge burger for this $8.99. I asked for biggest burger they have and I'm shocked with their quality and price. Definitely will stop again.<//Text>

<Review>Hands down best burgers at Kramer Junction. Yes it looks scary, yes it's a bit run down, yes they seem like more of a taco shop than a burger place when you walk in and order at the ominous podium that awaits you. Truth is this place is a well kept secret that only those who knpw about it will tell you. Don't be afraid! Get in there and order the best burger of your road trip!<//Review><Time>1561062329592<//Time><user_name>Robert Malek< /user_name></record>

Great food, reasonable prices. I mean a double cheeseburger with pastrami, brilliant! Chocolate shake was very good too. Menu is very large and fairly diverse. Road construction is killing there business, but they are worth a visit!</text>

I was passing through and this little burger shop in a rustic looking building caught my eye so I had to try it out. I had the cowboy burger and was more than satisfied with the product. I had a burger the day before in lone pine for twice the price and it wasn’t half the burger as this one. Well done Astro burger I’ll come back if I’m passing through this way again.< /Text>

<Review>Appearance is deceiving

From the outside the place looks like an abandoned drive-in, but we were pleasantly surprised by the tasteful food. Service was fast and prices very reasonable for the portion sizes< /Review>< user_id>

Surprisingly great, old-school "drive-in" burgers at this oasis in the desert (at one of the longest stoplights I have ever waited through).  It looks closed down, but don't be fooled. Stop in and enjoy... the prices are great!< /Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>The Classic hamburger here should be called, "Asco" Burger. Because they are Asquerosos - bread, lettice were low quality and the fake tasting beef patty is worse than McDonalds'. However, the Gyro sandwich was good except that they did not chop up the tomato to fit in the pita bread. Instead the left the large round slices they use for their hamburgers on it. I am sure that they are trying to save time by not chopping them but it makes it difficult to eat the gyro like that.</Review>< gmap_id>

Best burger I ever had in my life. It was so good that I bought second and some tacos to. My family of six had all of our food on the table in 8.56 seconds. I timed it. I really recommend it.< /review>

seriously!!! don't stop at Burger King. I actually really like Burger King but this here... Astro Burger is a real treasure!!! The tacos were amazing. I live in Chicago in heart of a mexican neighborhood so I'm bit of a taco snob!! And these taco's are so good. My girl friend had the Fried Zucchini. I don't know how they get Zucchini this fresh, but these were really fresh and had a wonderful snap. Mind you Fried Zucchini can be found at most high end bars in the biggest cities and my girl friend had had these there, and these Fried Zucchini here at astro burger were the best. I mean... think about it... a vegetarian option that doesn't suck out in the middle of no where. Astro burger is so good I'd totally make a detour to hit this place up when traveling anywhere near there. Looks like you're getting outnumbered Kevin ;)< /text>

The first time I stopped here I got a wet burrito and it was ok. Nothing special. But when I tried a burger here I was surprised. It was a really good burger and the fries were nice and crispy. If your passing through I wohld recomend stopping here for a burger.<//Text>

Food was good, not great, but good, service was quick and pleasant, the atmosphere is funky, stale, and makes for a great memory. The bathrooms are unappetizing, but that should not discourage one from visiting and checking it out. One major comment that must be pointed out, the ice is white. While the soda tasted fine, steer clear of their water.< /Review>

A lot of options, but the food isn't the freshest. Spicy chicken burger was very dry and spongy. Eat for cheap and move on, if that's all you need.<//Review>

Drab appearance and the bathroom was unappetizing; but the food came out fast and was surprisingly tasty. Much better than some crummy burger chain. Highly recommended for your next pitstop. (Try the chicken club!)<//Review>

Large selection of foods, I like the Mexican fare, huge selection, but also have a lot of hamburgers. Place could use a face lift and the bathrooms are tiny and dingy. Carne asada taco plate is pretty good.</review>

Are they not maintaining regular posted hours of business? Sad we got shooed out the door at 4:15 pm. on a Wednesday ) :  we were half way in the door when a man (the cook?) shooed us out saying they were closed while pointing at the red closed sign in the window, which he must have just flipped to closed as we had just saw customers walk out just a couple minutes prior.<//Review>

<date>1620674509956<//date><Name>Amy Coyle</Name><Review>This is the best salon! I have been coming here for 5+ years and I absolutely love this spot. Demetri and Hector are amazing, the staff is so friendly and the stylists are incredibly talented. I’m very picky about my hair and I love having a low-maintenance hair style that I don’t have to blow dry or recolor often, and this salon always delivers.

I would recommend this salon to anyone!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><gmapID>0x808580a72c01fad9:0xf4c6825ee3673954</gmapID><resp>None<//resp></record>

<review>I went for the first time after my boyfriend kept raving about this salon! I had Demetri cut my hair and told him to do what he thought would look best and I was not disappointed!!! He did such a clean and wonderful look for me. I needed a new look and so happy I came here!<//review>< name>

I have reeeeeally long, thick hair and they make it look and feel light, healthy, and sexy. They understand exactly the look I'm going for and even help guide my vision for what I want. I have never loved haircuts before, as I do now!</Review>< pics>

jams gave me an amazing cut and beautiful color! Even though my hair usually takes a long time to process, jams had it finished much faster then other salons I've gone to! Hector Estrada Salon is a really cool salon. Very relaxed and comfortable and they served ice coffee! I definitely recommend jams and will be going back again!< /review>

The stylists here are fantastically talented. A haircut isn't cheap, I believe $115 is the latest price for a haircut, but especially if you have curly hair, or very thick hair, they will take excellent care of you.</Text>

Had long hair my entire life and decided to cut it dramatically.  Was referred to NATALIJIA for short cuts and she did the damn thing.  She is very passionate about what she does and she knows her short cuts.  I went from long hair (my entire life) to shaved sides and I LOVE the cut.  Highly recommended to anyone looking to get a short cut..<//Text>

<Review>After 12 years in this city I have finally succeeded in finding the best hairstylists in San Francisco. I have nothing but positive things to say about Jose's work. He is a wizard when it comes to transforming the mess that is on top of my head into something presentable and his maintenance tips have helped my hair care tremendously.

I highly recommend Hector Estrada salon to anyone who is looking to find their one and only, like I have.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Best cut I've had so far. Jose truly knows his craft and provided a lot of useful tips for styling and maintaining my hair. Seeing him work with geometry and explaining what he does was really a pleasure.</text>

My very first time here and everyone was very welcoming from the host that greeted me to my hair stylist Anthony. This is my very first time ever getting a haircut with someone other than my hair stylist in Dallas. Being new to the bay area I was in the search for a good hair salon and they exceeded my expectations.Very happy with the outcome and I will definitely will 'be back.</Text>

I went in for a Balayage. While the service was great and the stylist was very talented, patient and nice, I dint feel like my requirements were understood accurately. The stylist did not ensure that my look matched the picture I shared or considered how I wear my hair. I had to proactively book a second appointment to get closer to the look I wanted. Unfortunately, it's still far from perfect.< /Text>

< Review>
I had a great experience with Ana who runs the front desk and manages rentals.  I was looking up alternatives to get a smaller unit and researching options to leave Public Storage - instead Ana was proactive and helped me find a smaller unit where I could downsize and fit my things in a space that I was able to afford.

She helped ensure my new unit was easily accessible from my old one so my move was easy and even helped me understand how to use the app which makes it easier to get in an out of the gate!

Ana gives a friendly, neighborly feel to a very big brand storage unit company.  I felt like my well-being was cared for as a customer.  She is the reason I continued my business with Public Storage, rather than going to a new company and goes above and beyond.

I'm a long-time, out-of-state tenant who called with a question about my unit. Ana very quickly returned my call, spoke to owner on my behalf, and got me a good answer in just a couple of hours. Thanks for the great service! Ana was also very personable and professional. BTW, I haven't been at the facility for awhile, but when I last visited it was well maintained and run (which is why I first chose it).<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been working with public storage the past several months and Ana from the Evans street facility has been exceptional.  She has gone above and beyond in terms of customer service by diligently making sure that my items were delivered when I was unable to be there to receive them.  She has been extremely
courteous and supportive and was also willing to go out of her way to make sure that the people that are delivering my items did so when they were supposed to. I’m grateful that I’ve had the ability to work with her through this process.< /Text>

<Review>After nightmarish dealing with a number of storage facilities in the SF Bay Area, what a lucky and fortuitous experience I experienced at the Public Storage location at 2090 Evans Street in San Francisco. When I called this location with my options running almost at an end, I spoke to Anna on the phone and was surprised by her helpful and polite phone presence as she went out of her way to explain to me what options for storage options available at her location. I was even more surprised when I arrived to find she was even more helpful in person than she was on the phone. She went out of her way to make sure I received first class treatment as opposed to the shabby attention to detail I had beed experiencing over the phone with EVERY storage company I had called prior to speaking with her. The rates didn't change after I arrived from the phone quote as seemingly was the standard practice with other I had dealt with earlier in the day. The facility was clean and well maintained, there were not hangers around to make one feel unsafe. And When completing the paperwork in the office, Annas, positivity and polite attitude carried over to the young gentleman named Buddy who helped us complete our business transaction. What a difference these people represented compared to those I had been dealing with on the phone. I felt respected and they defiantly made me feel like they were eager to have me as a customer. So, after a long week of packing, driving endless miles from Central Oregon to San Francisco and dealing with countless rude and unpleasant people on the phone and at their locations, this location and the staff made a trying week much better. Five Stars (*****) for their professionalism and polite dispositions. It is my distinct pleasure to do business with this Public Storage Location!<//Review>< UserId.>

<review>Had a great experience working with Eric and Anna — they were both friendly, and offered exceptional customer service. Booked the reservation kinda last minute and they made sure I was well taken care of. Worked with Anna initially to set everything up and she communicated everything with Eric so I was good to go upon moving in. Eric was also able to confirm my original rate even though I delayed my move-in and the original unit was no longer available. Everything went seamlessly and I was very impressed with the entire process. Would definitely recommend this location and working Anna and Eric.<//review>< date>

I was so thrilled how helpful Eric was at assisting us in booking our storage unit. He went out of his way to secure a great unit for us making our move much easier. We were super grateful for his hard work and outstanding customer service!< /text>

I went to public storage yesterday and just want to thank ERIC for the great service he provided. Was Interested in getting information about renting and informed me that we can now do everything on the public storage app! Such a great feature ! Pay online and now access a gate without touching a keypad which is great because of COVID.<//text>

Eric at public storage was straight forward, helpful and very insightful. I needed to get a storage space the day I contacted Public storave on Evans and he was able to get me the space I needed quickly. If you are looking for great customer service, getting into your storage space quickly I highly recommend Public storage on Evans.< /Review>

Thank you so much Eric for all the help today! This guy here knows his stuff. I came in today to see what size Sto ages units they had and Eric was so happy to help me. Gave me a quick walk around showing me what they had available and also offered storage supplies. Two thumbs up for this guy! I will definitely keep public storage in mind when I finalize my move.< /text>

<text>The property manager, Ana, was the friendliest property manager I have ever worked with. She gave me detailed instructions for how to access my unit and was always available to talk on the phone if I had any questions. I would go back to this Public Storage unit knowing that Ana is there to help out.

Yesterday I dropped by to drop off a few packages at fed ex and after that I was on my way to Lowe’s to see if they had any moving supplies. I saw public storage while at the stop sign and decided to back up and park and see if they had any. I asked the gentlemen who I saw cleaning the area if they sold moving supplies and let me tell you  he started off by introducing himself. Eric was so helpful and told me that Ana was inside and would help me with any moving needs. The lobby was so clean and everything was so organized. I loved the fact the they have a display box showing how the big the boxes are. So much better then me grabbing folded boxes and seeing how big they are. They had everything I needed. Ana and Eric  you both were very professional and helpful. Thanks again! If I ever need a storage room I will definitely be coming to public storage.</Text>

Eric and Ana provided great customer service. I was in need of some moving supplies and they had everything I needed and were so kind to ring me up with a smile. I have had bought moving supplies from other companies and they all seem like they hate life. It’s always a great experience with public storage.  They are always kind and helpful. I will be needing a storage unit at the end of the month and will definitely be looking at reserving one with public storage. Thanks again to Eric and Ana.< /Text>

I will start by saying that Ana, the onsite property manager, is AWESOME.  I was a customer here for 11 years so I have some history, and I saw this place change from a poorly run, unsafe (had a couple break-ins) and dirty storage facility under the previous manager to a complete 180 degree turnaround since Ana took over about 2 years ago.  She has completely cleaned and secured the facility, and makes sure every interaction with me/customers is a pleasant one.  She's very proactive, will greet you outside and help you open gates if she's available.  Unfortunately being a client here for 11 years my rent just kept increasing and ran up too high, but I would stay just for my confidence in Ana alone.  She definitely deserves every recognition and Public Storage is lucky to have her at this location.  (Ana, come to my new location in Millbrae please!! lol)</review>

My experience here at public storage has been wonderful. Ana is an amazing person with a beautiful spirit. and she really cares about her customers. If you are looking for a clean, secure property to store your valuables and have grade A customer service, Public storage on Evans is the way to go. I had multiple storage units all over the bay area. Ana is by far the best ive done business with!< /Text>

All of my worldly possessions lived here at 2090 Evans for about a year and I couldn't be happier.  Finding the unit was easy and quick set-up, and the customer service from Ana and Yapo was incredible. Ana was quick to help me in any way necessary, advocating for me to management during the resolution of an inquiry I had... and she was proactive in calling and updating on the process.. all the while with a positive and supportive attitude. My belongings were safe and there were no incidents or concerns about the facility.  I very infrequently submit reviews, but the level of service I received here warrants the praise.  Thank you!</text>

I just want to thank Eric so much for the great customer service he has provided me. He was the only one working and works so hard to make sure everyone gets the help he needs. Public storage is lucky to have such a great employee like him who loves his job. Public storage needs to hire more people like this gentleman. Thank you again Eric !!< /Review>

<Text>I've been at Public Storage for at least 6 years now and there's a reason why that is. The staff there are really nice and friendly.

I came in looking to buy some moving blankets but unfortunately they did not have them.  It they did have a full stock of moving boxes tape and even mattress covers which I didn’t even think of buying until now. This whole time I have been using bed sheets to move my mattresses and was always afraid of getting it dirty and now I don’t have to worry. Even thou we are going thru a pandemic it’s great to know our essential workers here at public storage are helping everyone with a smile.  Eric and Ana thank you for all the help you are providing and thank you for having such a positive attitude. You guys rock!!!<//review>< pictures>

I would give it a zero rating if I could.  Woman ( I believe her name is Ana, which I gleaned from other reviews, but I'm not sure because she refused to tell me) yelled at me this morning and hung up on me saying she would just have the district manager talk to me after I questioned a charge. Whether or not I sign a contract, I have every right to ask about charges.  She mentioned my contract and asked if I had even read it, instead of talking with me she belittled me. I believe she is the regular manager, she was hostile and uncommunicative.  I really hope they record phone calls, as I'm sure nothing can be done unless they do.  I would advise Public Storage to review the recording, I'm honestly still in shock.</text>

Other storage unit operators could learn a few things from Evans Ave Public Storage. I found them to be professional, informative, and friendly. I was impressed by the layout, the upkeep of the facilities and attention to the security of the building and units. Eric was outstanding and made sure from the very beginning we understood the process of moving in and billing. I've  used other storage facilities in the City, I wish I had gone to this one first.< /text>

I came to paid my Mom storage and the service I received from Ana was the best greeting I ever received in my life. I went to the other location where I usually go but office was closed and waited there for over 30 minutes and when the lady came back she was very rude and was on her phone all the time she basically ignored me so I walked out there and came here.<//Review>

As a businessman myself I am a fan of the Public storage company. This is the second time I have used their services in the bay this past year and I couldn’t be happier with the service and security of the space. Eric was very helpful and friendly in assisting me finding my unit and setting me up with an extra lock for insured security even though my unit is on the inside of the building. This is definitely your cheapest and best option for any of your storage needs and I would recommend them to anyone who needs a little or a lot extra space.<//Review>

When I walk into there to make a payment I was greeted with the most beautifulest smile and energy from Anna. She was very pleasant and she remembered my name being that I just met her last month there with a friend. Anna and Chris has great customer service and if I know of anyone or even myself who needs a storage I will definitely refer or bring my business to them being that they were very courteous. Which is hard to find these days. Thank you for brightening my day with that wonderful beautiful energy!</text>

One thing that would be helpful is a facility map. Its like a maze in there - and it takes a while to understand where you are. It also takes a while for the sales rep to show you the units that are available. If they had a map, it would save a lot of time.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7fac29d1e4d5:0x4fb9f306f0664c1d</Gmap_id></record>

Anna at the Evans Public Storage location made my spirit excellent One of the problems I did have was with that when I got to the to the property. I have to buy an additional lock for $20 after it was articulated to me that the lock was built specifically for those units and never way safer than buying bring my own lock. I understood that but when I didn't look forward to was having to bring another 20 haven't go back and get another $20 and then come back that made it difficult. So if you could be put inside, you know it along with the initial when your pricing is then I wouldn't have to go somewhere and get $20 and come back. I think it should be articulated. Enterprise in over the phone that this this lock is specific to these units. And it was awesome and Anna the articulated to me. So I wouldn't feel cheated or despondent. She did a really good job.

Very nice facility. I have used this storage for a few months now and it is very clean, well maintained and the staff are friendly and helpful. Compared to other public storage locations in San Francisco, this one is significantly better.<//Review>

We’ve used this storage facility for 5 years and have always been very happy with the service. We recently changed to a different size locker and the staff were extremely helpful in making the transitions and making sure we had the best deal possible for our needs. Ana is amazing...super friendly and helpful going above and beyond for us. Of all the storage lockers we researched, we got the best deal with the best security here!!!<//Text>

Great secure facility and got a very thorough explanation of the whole property and renting a unit from Eric. Public Storage really helped me out in a pinch because a nearby storage facility was completely full. Highly recommended!< /review>

Erik was awesome. He helped me pick out boxes and helped me load my car. He was patient with me while I looked at packing supplies and helped me find the right items. Moving is so stressful. If you need moving supplies and a laugh, go see Erik.</Text>

Anna provided excellent customer service with a concern I raised this week.  She responded promptly, said she' follow-up within a couple of days and the next day I had a very favorable resolution.  A much better experience than I expected.  Thanks, Anna!< /Review>

<review>Absolutely terrible customer service experience. Avoid renting here if you can find an alternative. And if you can’t, plan well in advance of any visit to avoid getting your stuff locked out in the open.

It was around 4pm and I got a flat tire while trying to get the moving truck to the unit to pick up my stuff (this was a weekend, so the gates closed at 5pm). My stuff was sitting outside the unit with the unit open. I got back a few minutes after 5, and there was absolutely no way to get back into the storage. The people in the office blamed an “automatic system with motion detectors that would call the cops” if they let me in. They claimed they had no way to turn the system off temporarily, and they wouldn’t contact the owner because it was “after hours” (literally only 20 minutes after close at this point).

I had to get up at 5:30am the next day to get to the unit right at open (6am) to secure the thousands of dollars of stuff that was sitting outside.

Bottom line is they are extremely inflexible. Don’t rely on customer service to help you, or even there being a way to buy your way out of a tight spot. If you lose your key, you have to wait 3 days for a locksmith. If you find yourself needing to access the unit out of hours, they will actively try to stop you.

The building is located in a sketchy area. It’s not a friendly atmosphere, where other tenants look you up and down or just avoid contact at all while unloading.

Also, they used to have a large trash bin outside that you could use which was super convenient, but they got rid of it recently.<//review>< Pics>

At the time I rent the unit, Bayo was very helpful and nice. However time went by and the costumer service at first got decline in a big way... The property needs an update when it comes to the doors going between areas.  Doors slammed into my good every time I walk through the areas with doors.</Review>

<Text>The location was clean and appears to have good level of security. The manager called me moments after I made an on line reservation. He set an appointment time to come view the storage facility and specific unit. On the morning of my appointment, the same manager called and asked if I could come a little earlier or later as he had another potential client coming in at the same time I requested. I came in earlier and he efficiently and thoroughly conducted his tour and completed my registration process.</Text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Resp>

< review>
My experience at this location has been great. But it's mainly due to Mercado's great customer service. He's excellent and cares about his customers. He helped me find the perfect size storage. When I was visiting my storage the other day, I had a hard time locking the lock (it's a bit tricky at first) and he came and showed me exactly how to do it, with a smile on his face--as always. He really takes care of his customers and assists whenever possible. My only concern is with some of the gates that have broken sensors. The gates are supposed to close at 9 p.m., however, but there are two gates that have broken sensors and have to be closed at 6 p.m. We parked in a different gate that we were told works fine, but when we were unloading, the other person working at the storage came and told us that we have to remove the truck because the gate will come down automatically and they might not be able to open it again. This was all before 6 pm., although this gate is supposed to close at 9 p.m. I confirmed to her that this was the gate we were told that works fine, but she insisted we remove the truck. This was a hassle because it made the unloading process more difficult. I recommend they fix this problem as it becomes a hassle during the loading/unloading process. Other than that, I'm happy with my experience.</review>

Had a great, smooth, and thurough experience at this Public Storage today, Jose and Conrado helped me get the storage unit and explained the logistics clearly with happy smiles that left me feeling secure and knowledgeable about how to operate the storage.

Cheers to them for making it fun and easy. They offered great suggestions and extra help.

Overall big facility with easy access/parking. Dolly's to borrow and code access. Thanks Jose and Conrado!< /text>

<text>we were in need of assistance during our  move out day and had everything we needed from Conrado. all we had to do is ask. we were very stressed with all the movers and he made our experience very smooth.

thanks Conrado! we will always refer anyone in need of a storage unit to the Evans location in San Francisco.

What great customer service! Conrado helped me get the unit, the paperwork, and the locks all straightened out quickly and politely. He even did two follow-up calls to make sure everything was okay. I appreciated the friendly customer service and if I need a unit again, 2090 Evans will be it.< /Text>

< Review>
The cleanest, most convenient Public Storage facility in SF with the absolute best manager, Bayo. What a great guy. He is incredibly kind, helpful, and supportive.

This has been the easiest and best facility for me. 6 cargo bays, you just back your car right in. If they’re full, just park outside. Never much traffic or activity here. It’s surprisingly quiet for being so close to the freeway. 101 and 280 are minutes away. Also- 6AM access. One of only 2 facilities to offer that.

Overall great experience. Big thanks to you Bayo!< /Review>

Change of gate access hours from closing at 9pm to NOW 6pm. What is this? No rent decrease either. Find another place to rent that has more reasonable hours where you don’t have to leave work early to get to your unit. ZERO STARS if that was an option here.</text>

Bayo and Conrado were so helpful and kind. I came in to ship my bike and they were knowledgeable and went above and beyond to help me find a box that would fit. In addition, they helped me pack my bike and bring it over to FedEx. This type of customer service is rare and will absolutely bring me back to public storage in hunters point in the future!</text>

<user_name>Aguilera Taxes</user_name><Response>None<//Response><Text>Conrado is an exemplary employee of Public Storage.  Very professional, courteous, helpful and always with a smile on his face.  Which is why I've done business at this location rather than the SSF location I used to use.

On 11/25/13 I was helped by Angel who was temporarily helping out at the Evans location and I found her to be very efficient in the handling of the paperwork.  She too was courteous and with a smile on her.

It is a pleasure using this service and highly recommended by me.

Thank you.<//Text>< Rate>

Staff was helpful and patient, showed us several options and helped us make a decision.  Facility seems secure and accessible but a few things could use an upgrade (handles need jiggling, garage doors don't all work).  Plus we got a great price booking online< /review>

I was very please with the staff helping me setting up my storage space at the facility which was very fast.  They gave me a tour of the building and told me where I can park my car near the loading zone in the building. I had easy access to the restroom and the carts.</Text>

Conrado, the staff who assisted me with my account and move in, was excellent! The facility and prices also seem quite good. The big issue is that 3/6 of the load-in gates are currently not functioning, making move-in more complicated than it needs to be.< /text>

I have used many Public Storage properties in San Francisco and have stayed with the Evans property now for several years.  My unit is safe and secure and the manager, Bayo, is fabulous and supports the customer in any way he can.  He has great customer service skills and his priority is always the customer.  Can't say enough about the storage facility on Evans.</review>

<text>I can't believe a company that is supposed to provide a SECURE place to store your stuff can go for 2 months with a damaged front roll up door. Anyone can walk in after hours. I would think twice about renting a storage unit here.< /text>< GmapID>

The staff members, especially Conrado and Bayo , were very helpful in answering questions about my storage space.  They were very responsive with issues on my bills.  Conrado and Bayo were very prompt in returning my phone calls.  The facility is very clean and secure.  It is very easy to park my car near the docking zone and not worrying about using the elevators to get to my storage space.< /review>

<review>In addition to getting a really good deal on a 5'x15' unit, I had an above-and-beyond customer service experience with the manager, Bayo. I got lost and didn't make it to the storage compound to sign for my unit until 5 minutes to closing. The process takes a bit of time and they instruct you to show up 30 minutes before closing to setup your unit for the first time. Bayo told me that I was too late, but then to my great fortune, took pity on me and got my unit setup and ending up working 20+m past closing with his family waiting for him to finish. I'm in the middle of a hectic move and it was extremely important to get that unit setup at that time. I wanted to tip Bayo but he absolutely refused even upon my insistence.  He really saved my butt. Besides customer service, I found the prices to be very competitive for the area and I got a great deal on a climate-controlled unit---something I didn't think would fit my budget but makes me feel better about storing some electronics and paintings in my unit. Pretty happy so far that I went with public storage so far.</review></record>

The manager, Bayo, was very very friendly and such a big help in my storage rental. He suggest me to find online the 1 dollar per month deal and saved me at least 40 bucks! And he was also very efficient in processing your orders. I would def come back to this store if I need storage!<//Text>

<review>I needed to get a space quick this month and Conrado was very quick to fit me in and explained everything great.

He is a great employee and thanks to him for his details to set up our account.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7fac29d1e4d5:0x4fb9f306f0664c1d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>In addition to getting a really good deal on a 5'x15' unit, I had an above-and-beyond customer service experience with the manager, Bayo. I got lost and didn't make it to the storage compound to sign for my unit until 5 minutes to closing. The process takes a bit of time and they instruct you to show up 30 minutes before closing to setup your unit for the first time. Bayo told me that I was too late, but then to my great fortune, took pity on me and got my unit setup and ending up working 20+m past closing with his family waiting for him to finish. I'm in the middle of a hectic move and it was extremely important to get that unit setup at that time. I wanted to tip Bayo but he absolutely refused even upon my insistence.  He really saved my butt. Besides customer service, I found the prices to be very competitive for the area and I got a great deal on a climate-controlled unit---something I didn't think would fit my budget but makes me feel better about storing some electronics and paintings in my unit. Pretty happy so far that I went with public storage so far.< /text><userid>110093355107280166300< /userid>< pics>

Conrado was very helpful and professional.  Unlike other storage units closer to the city center, this facility had easy parking close to the storage units.</review>

< Review>
I'm updating my review due to my frustration with Public Storage.
Bayo and Conrado were very friendly and helpful, but I had a huge problem with payments and move in. My  credit card was charged 3 times the day I moved in and it took them 23 days to remove the charge. I called the district manager, and his supervisor and left messages, neither returned my call and no one in customer service could help. If it wan't such a pain to move, I would take my business else where, the management service is terrible.<//Review>

<text>I just moved into a storage unit and thanks to Eric, it was a very easy process. He provided great customer service to not only me, but to several other customers as well who had stopped in while I was there. I look forward to his continued service. Public Storage is lucky to have such a great employee working for it.<//text>< response>

Ever since the management changed a year or two again, this place has gone down the drain. Despite the quality of food not being the same, and the service not being as efficient, I still supported them up until tonight. I placed a Postmates order for two items at 11:51, I receive a notification that they are out of one of the two items. When I substitute that item, I receive another notification that now both items are out of stock.
I called the store and ask what was the problem the owner goes "we closed". I said - don't you guys close at 12- he said yes AND HUNG UP ON ME while I was trying to ask when the last order would be. I called back a couple of times before he picked up again and he was not at all sorry about his customer service and hanging up on me.
Lost me as a customer.<//text>

The pizza here is amazing! It's a wonderful addition to the kosher restaurant in the Pico-Robertson area. Posted is the Mac and cheese pizza, and it's so far my favorite one.< /Text>

<text>A glorified pizza take out, with a few grubby tables to eat at. What's different? Their offering is like a salad bar, but for pizzas. You move along a line, selecting base topping etc. Ok so far. They also do salads, but were missing over half the things I asked for. I ordered gluten free pizza instead. Very mediocre, oily, underwhelming and over priced.

If you weren't kosher, why on earth would you eat here?< /text>< Pics>

This place is wonderful for people who eat kosher! It's like Blaze Pizza, but everything is kosher. They have a nice vegan cheese and gluten free crust options. There are plenty of toppings to choose from, and yummy chocolate chip cookies. The bathrooms are clean, and there's tons of room in the place. Really great spot!</Text>

I like it even more that it's under new ownership.  Their food is great and very fresh. They have variety of vegetables ,vegan sausage , gluten free doughs, and all are very delicious  . Also, i love their beyond cheese burger and chocolate shake. This is the only place that my kids love to eat and people there are very kids friendly.
I highly recommend them.< /Text>

The food quality  was ok. I question though why they think 28 minutes from ordered till delivered for a strawberry shake is anything close to reasonable. I would suggest Pizza World any day over this this for superior service & atmosphere. I told one of the employees who was sitting at the back customers table with his iPhone that the men's restroom was completely out of towels when I just came out. 2 minutes later when we walked out he hadn't moved.< /text>

Their answering machine says they’re open from 11am on Sunday..... yet it’s 11:40 and the door is still locked, with multiple people waiting outside.  (There are employees inside, who are probably setting up).

Still giving 5 stars.... ‘cos Christina is that good.   But they need to make sure their times are correct.

Bibis opens at 8am on Sundays.  Nagilla pizza at 11.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Place is very neat and clean.
Service is good, I asked to lower the volume of the music and they did right away.
I'm Italian so I'm very judgemental about pizza, so I'll say that the basil was absolutely wonderful, but the pizza dough and sauce were a bit blend, but still tasted better than all of the other kosher fast-food tasting pizzas.
Fries were really good.
Definitely planning to come back and try some other options in here.<//Text>< gmap_id>

I really enjoy the food, but they offer vegan cheese yet half of the times I’ve gone in they have not had it. Today I called in first, surprise, no vegan cheese yet again. Get more consistent with ordering the stuff so I can recommend this otherwise great place to my friends!!<//review>

This place is amazing! Build your own pizza!! They have anything you can think of and everything is fresh, delicious and really high quality. A cool soda machine as well! The service is outstanding and the atmosphere is great.

Besides that the design is really nice which ties in with this place being a really good pizza place.

It’s kosher as well which makes this place really one of a kind!! Highly recommend!!</text>

If you like creating your own things including your own food this is definitely the place to go, many different options for many different varieties of salads and pizza. Great selection of drinks in there really cool one dispenser Coke machine, it's basically unlimited refills.
They have other things on the menu such as milkshakes cotton candy etc. You should definitely stop by!!</Review>

This is a kosher version of the build-your-own pizza trend (ie like Blaze Pizza and Mod Pizza in the non kosher world).  For that reason, it's an important addition to the Pico Boulevard kosher restaurant lineup. Since my last review two years ago, this place has improved significantly. The toppings are more generous now, vegetables toppings are unlimited now and impossible burger toppings are a welcome addition.</review>

This is my second time there. 1st time we were at the line for more than an hour and everything was great!! But yesterday we arrived in quit time (5pm), the pizza guy was very nice and fast! The thing was with the salad lady!! It took her 6 minutes!!! to come to the display and start my salad then she fill tones of lettuce, and when I asked for cucumbers she put about 6-7 little cubes when I asked to add more she said it's extra!!! And same with the carrot, at this point I decided to give up my salad!!! My kids were really excited about the pizza so we staid but no with the same vibe. I think for the prices it ok to put more veggies on the salad and be nicer😕<//review>

<review>I custom made a pizza here and it was delicious. I would say that it was a little overwhelming custom making my own pizza with all the options. It may be better for some to choose a pre-made pizza off the menu and you can still tweak it such as adding pesto sauce instead of marinara. Definitely will return again!</review></record>

Great kosher pizza restaurant. Has a ton of custom pizza options. Really great if you like thin crusted personal pies. If you want to try multiple types of their house pies ask them to do half and half. Beware of the Saturday night rush.</text>

Really nice to see a kosher restaurant in LA that's actually changing things up a bit. The pizza isn't amazing, but it's different, and very customizable. The salad is also great. However, it can get write crowded and loud on some nights.< /Text>

<review>I was extremely dissapointed with the misleading menu. As one who is sensitive to gluten and eats kosher, I was excited to try their gluten free pizza. Each time I've gone, they did not have the gluten free pizza, and I walked out of there hungry. When I spoke to the employees, they had no clue when the gluten free dough to arrive, and did not seem to care whatsoever. In addition, the "soda machine" was out of everything except for water (and flavored water). The only reason I'm not giving them one star is because their salads are tasty.<//review>< pics>

Pizza and salad excellent
saying that last night After Shabbat my wife and friends came as
we do almost after Shabbat and she fainted outside
Could not get anyone to come and open the door for a chair and some water.
Hatzola,  City Ambulance came and people behind the counter completely ignored the situation. Your staff needs some training in

Kosher do it yourself pizza. I think Kramer came up with this idea in the first season of Seinfeld. You don't actually touch any of the components but you select everything from crust type to sauce (red, spicy red, white cream or presto) to toppings. To augment the fun is an amazing diy Coke-branded soda machine that contains every beverage in the coca cola family (eg Hi-C, Fanta) plus flavored versions of Coke that don't even exist in the wild. It's a little loud but what do you expect from a place that careers to kids.</Text>

They asked me for my dob and ssn during a phone interview, which I thought was weird. I called back the recruiter and it went to voicemail. My experience is consistent with the reviews I have read on this page. I’m concerned that this is not a legitimate business.</review>

This place is nothing but a scam. A recruiter contacted me after I applied on their website. I was told that they have afew jobs matching my skills and experience. A week goes by and no contact. Well, the next day I called but no response. Later in the day I tried calling again and no luck. Afew minutes later, he calls and rudely tells me to stop calling him since his in a zoom meeting. I apologised since I needed a job. Well that was a few months ago and till to date, he has not once called me with a job offer. After reading all the reviews, I now know that they just collect data. I wonder if they sell our data to third parties since after contacting them, I have all of a sudden started to get job postings from people and companies I have never applied to.< /Text>

<Time>1605729319924< /Time><rating>1<//rating><review>Roseville Ca, Office opens at 8am and I’ve tried calling multiple times and nobody answered...Received a missed phone call from recruiter Andrew by 1 minute regarding a application I was following up on and I tried calling right back but no response....I’ve probably called a total of 20 times both the recruiter phone line and their office phone line before a lady at the office picks up..I tell her I’ve received a call from the recruiter and she transferred me to once again the recruiters voicemail..I’ve tried calling back a couple of more times and she finally answers again. I inform her that the recruiter line is going to voicemail and she tells me “oh well looks like he’s in a meeting, you can leave a voicemail for him” never did I receive a phone call after leaving 2 voicemails...the next day I tried once again calling and no respond...finally a different recruiter calls me and I inform him on the position I’m acquiring about...he tells me he will take my information and pass it on to Andrew..I tell him I’ve had no luck getting response and was asking for another recruiter...I was then told the best thing I can do is not call and wait for them to call and that the worst thing a person can do is call ( a temp agency who’s job is to HELP PEOPLE get jobs) too much because that will in other words irritate them and not want to employ you...Are you not suppose to follow up on job applications?..doesn’t that show determination and commitment?.. I have never heard a employer let along a TEMP AGENCY tell anyone we won’t hire you if you call too much especially with a COVID pandemic going on and lots of people looking for work, that was two days ago and I have STILL NOT received a call back....sounds like this company lacks the professionalism of other temp agency's (volt, labor ready, elite HR, etc) seems they would rather be lazy instead of actually doing their job...HELPING PEOPLE FIND WORK!..< /review>< pictures>

<review>employee safety isn't a concern at all.   they'll also gaslight you on what happened at their client locations, despite themselves never been onsite.

they quote obsolete CDC guidelines from earlier 2020 of the pandemic and attribute that to the surge in late 2020 and force you to go into the office.

employee safety isn't a concern at all and only their bottom line is!

go with another recruiter agency.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Went in for an interview. Seemed to go great. I was pretty qualified for the positions Jasmine said they had open. Told me she'd reach out to them and get back to me like. Never got back to me so I emailed her about 2 weeks later and she never replied back to that so pretty unprofessional. Felt lied to and that I have wasted my time. Sucks because I truly felt that this company cared for the temps they placed. Guess I was just naive.</Review>

<review>In all honesty this company is very professional. My Recruiter Roz called back the same day i applied and tried her best to find me the wage and career i was looking for. She gave me options of companies to choose from and had me working very quickly for a company who ended up hiring me on full time. I would recommend this place to everyone. If you need employment let this place be your 1st choice. -Isaac B.<//review>< pics>

This place was reccomended to me by my in law. Was able to get in and speak with Kayla. Who was super friendly and seemed willing to help. Leaving the office I have told my sister and a friend about them and how they should go check them out. But unfortunately it was an act. Haven't recieved the help I needed. No responses to emails I've left. And therefore told those I referred to not even waste their time with them. Best of luck to those who do.< /Review>

To whom it may concern,
I was contacted by Julia from AeroTek in August of 2019 regarding an entry level CAD Drafter position with All Weather Insulated Panels in Vacaville, CA. After reviewing the job description, I submitted my resume as I felt my experience aligned well with the position. After a few months of sending information she wanted, such as digital portfolios, and professional references, I was told to wait until after the Christmas and New Year holiday since the managers were out of town. I was scheduled for an interview on January 15th with Marco (Manager), Sarah, and Jordan. After completing tests and questions from the panel, I felt satisfied with the outcome of the interview. I was contacted by Julia the same day informing me that Macro contacted her and would like to offer me a position if I accepted $20/hour instead of the $25/hour that I requested. I accepted the offer and was asked if I could start work January 27th, 2020 which I accepted. Julia informed me that I would need to do a drug test and background check before then which she would schedule. I was also offered a position elsewhere with a different company which I declined because All Weather offered me a position. January 20th, 2020 I was contacted by Julia informing me that Corporate Headquarters for All Weather declined the offer. I was confused on why Corporate would need to approve since I did not meet or interview with them directly. I spoke with Julia and her Account Manager Kate regarding the reason for the disapproval, in which they said Corporate said I did not have enough experience. Marco and Sarah specifically said in my interview that there is a lot to learn and that they would train me properly since it is an entry level position. Sarah even mentioned that they recommend that I do not take notes for the first week of work since there is an overload of information. I tried reaching out to Marco to discuss this, but he did not want to reply to me. I spoke with Julia and Kate on a 3-way call and told them it not only embarrassed me personally because my family was informed of my new hire as well. I believe the reputation of All Weather Insulated Panels is not as family oriented as they claim to be. I told Julia and Kate that All Weather should disclose the process of hiring during the interview so applicants can be aware of their status. If I would have known there would be another approval from Corporate, then I would not have declined the other company and waited for a final offer. Another hic-cup in this situation is that AeroTek should not be congratulating me without a final approval offer which Julia and Kate both apologized repeatedly. I would not recommend working for a company like All Weather Insulated Panels if they cannot hold onto what they claim to represent, which is being straight forward with its applicants.< /Text>

Clean office, seems professional until they schedule you for a job. One of the people working for areotek screws over new employees. Gets them a position, then when the worker arrives 10 minutes early to speak with the person about how to do said job, he never shows. We have been here waiting since 7:20am and they said he would be here in 30 minutes. Extremely unprofessional and it makes sense that people don't follow through with jobs from aerotek. I extremely  do not support this company, DO NOT GO THROUGH THEM! ENTIRELY UNRELIABLE AND WORTHLESS!<//text>

<text>My experience with Aerotek has been less than stellar. unprofessional. She told me we would set up a meeting today. I had to call her to confirm the appointment. And she said I already spoke to someone else and applied for a position and I didn't have enough experience so don't bother coming in. What if I didn't call and just showed up. Shows they don't really care about your time. And it's funny because I have over 10 years of experience in this field. It's as if they Steal each other's leads, and don't communicate together, and all of a sudden they don't tell you anything. In fact she never sent me the address or confirmation email like she was supposed to. no thanks</text><gmap_id>0x809add3f7e5af2fb:0xd28889bdb9d0abc4<//gmap_id>< Rate>

<user_id>107942367113290538989<//user_id><Review>AEROTEK used me for their own benefit. They conviced me to give up my position on my previous job for a job they guaranteed me to last for over a year or more just to get positions filled.  My recruiter started off very caring and helpful as much as he could at the start but after I started to see things come to an end "WAYYY" too early and I mentioned to them a couple times that the job was wrapping up and I needed to be reasured they had work for me. They promised me the job was not going to be over and I would be fine, and if the job did end they would have another one lined up for me. Sure enough, when all was said and done, their position did come to an end, and lasted only 3 months. My recruiter ghosted me and left me without work and I had no choice but to find a new job myself. This company does not care about you and will screw you over.<//Review></record>

I came to this agency for the first time, the ladies at the front counter was very polite & greeted me. I  was introduced  to my agent “MIKA” she is very polite, friendly, and knowledgeable. Mika went over all information about the job positing, and the company. She was very through and professional, also continuously kept in contact with me via the phone and  email. My first day at this new position, she met me at the company and walked me in. This reassures me that Aerotek and their Agents values their clients, and will go the extra mile for them.<//Text>

I really enjoyed my recruiter Mika at Aerotek. She was extremely professional, yet very social and open. Splitting ways from my previous job, Mika was able to understand my future career goals and apply them to a job that was in my field. She listened to all my responses and asked very open ended questions which made me able to dig deep in what I want in a career. She has a bubbly personality and I highly recommending talking to her as a recruit. She's a great person to talk to if you're trying to get into a field that you were studying for or just a job in general. She also does not make you feel like you are a waste of time. She really invests her time in understanding who you are and where you want to be. That, is what really caught my eye and what really pulled me in, as well. Some other staffing agencies are just trying to get by and place you somewhere to get you out of the way,  but Mika really listens and tries her hardest to get you somewhere. I really appreciated that. Definitely will recommend her to any of my family and friends! :)< /Text>

Of course, I expect Areotek to reply to this post in their defense. However, they had an opportunity with a brilliant and well- disciplined resume to concluded a job search, they still dropped the ball.</Text>< Pictures>

Read carefully: Aerotek employees are Very friendly people, they always keep you update whenever there's opening. Josh was the first recruiter I keep contact wit, every time josh call to see if im available for work, I always say yes. Only problem is?  He always go back to his favorite saying, "let me get a hold of the manager and I'll get back at you asap." like okay? Randstad/spectra/exact staff took me in and gave me jobs. months later, some girl name crystal from Aerotek started hitting me up everyday about my apps she saw on indeed or their website, not sure exact where but, she called and asked If I'm still interested? She have couple of spots that are open right now and can put me on. I gave her a call and we spoke, she asked what kind of job/field I'm looking for. I told her what I'm looking for and she replied she have few spots open that matches my needs. Then she asked if I want my name in her system so that she can get a hold of me when there's a spot open. I said yes, and what do you know, same thing josh said when I said yes to a position offer. "Let me get a hold of the manager and I'll get back to you asap. But you just said you have a few spots open; Hmm...kinda weird. After that conversation wit her, I never hear from her again. I even tried and reach out to her for updates, left couple messages and still no call back. Before she would always call back whenever I left a message. not until my name was in her system. See? Very friendly and always communicating very well, until they have your name in their system then you're welp! Lol! It's all about getting people in their system, that's how bonus kicks in for them. The more they put on, the more they take home. They ain't really out to help you. Josh and crystal, thank you very much for always leaving me in a loop of wonders. Lol! Give it try peeps.</review>

WORST VAPE SHOP IN TAHOE BUYERS BEWARE!! Went with my sister to get this “brand new” and “unopened” vape, only to find out its clearly been opened and used. When we tried to call back and ask for a refund they not only were rude and unprofessional but they also refused to let us return it or even come back and show it to them.</review>

The gentleman at the storefront decided to ignore me for 10 minutes with no one else in the store, despite me asking about a product, then 3 people (likely friends) came in and he went to chat with them and continued to ignore me. Don’t waste your breath. If this guys not the owner then I’m afraid you have the worst customer service I have seen in tahoe.</review>

Super Low Quality Glassware, not worth your time.
I had a piece break as I left the parking lot, went back in and the guy said “Glass breaks, no matter quality”< /text>

Closes early unexpectedly. they should post the price of each disposable and how many puffs it has because T gets irritated when you don’t remember. It seems real simple to just list brands with prices and  put it in the window instead of forcing us to ask.  He refuses to run my debit card as credit, which is really suspicious when the other sales rep has no problem~ and even turned down a $55 sale when I didn’t have the pin for a new card. It makes me feel uncomfortable using my pin in front of him. You can tell he’s not the owner, nor does he work on commission.  He def has no interest in making profit for the business.<//review>

< Review>
I shop here for my vaping supplies. I've been coming here for years, ever since they first opened. Its your basic head shop/vaping store with a good selection of glass and other types of pipes. Ceramic pipes, the new silicone pipes, and everything else for your smoking needs. The vape selection is pretty good as well. I go with the yocan line of self contained wax burners and hand held vaporizers. I like YoCan products because of the pricing and the quality of the products. So, if you are looking for vaping equipment and you can't find where to go, then please check this place out. Afrer looking at some of the other reviews i figured that the people that moan and whine just don't know what the people who work there are about. Its not easy to please everyone all the time. For instance, reviewers have said they were rude. Thats absolutely not the case. They are from India, the Punjab region. A place I've visited in years past. Plus they don't speak English all that well. So people just think they are rude. Americans can be so stuck up sometimes. I'm a white American myself, but I've traveled the world. It has a good parking lot too, in and out is very easy. Happy vaping! 720 rules!</Review>

<Text>Spent over $250 in store on 9/28/2020 and one of my $32 exxus snap Batteries did not function before or after a charge no matter how many ways I clicked the button. I called to ask for an exchange and was told that’s I’d have to wait until Saturday’s when the owner is in the Store  Even though I was only in town for a few days on vacation. Hopefully they make it right.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Good service, and when I accidentally got the wrong item they let me switch it out 15 min later when I noticed.  Very clean place too.  They were constantly speaking spraying counters when I was there.</review>

BUYER BEWARE! Total import clone knockoff store. Nothing you buy here will work its fresh off the boat from China. E-Juice is wayyy overpriced, mods are clones that do NOT work. Batteries are dangerous, and not legit. Nothing in this store is authentic.< /Text>

Worst customer service EVER!.. I WILL NEVER GO BACK!. After dropping 300 on mods and juice I come to find out that my mod will not charge via usb. The sales guy who was super nice told me one thing and iit was a mistake. So 1 hour after I left I returned and the owner told me that he can't help me but told me I need to spend another 50 to get the charger and batteries. . This place blows. . Buyer beware.. the owner will not support his products. Blah...< /Review>

Great selection on vape and oils.  A bit costy but cpmparing fepm traveling out of the area and spending gas or ordering online, just get it here!  Whatever it is you're lookong for, you're more than likely to find here.  Staff is friendly and very helpful and will always tell you what is a must for your needs wether they get thw sale or not.  Very honest group of people that work here.< /Text>

A little pricey for used, but good store. Clothing is well organized. The store is clean. Customer service always pleasant. Several good finds. This is a little bit more towards the boutique style as far as dresses, etc. Have found some good name brand stuff and great jean selection. Not as dirty as other 2nd hand stores. I recommend.<//Review>

<text>Im very upset because i called before i came and before i loaded my truck with furniture. When i called to see if they take furniture the girl on the phone said hold on let me ask to make sure. She return and said yes they are taking furniture i get to the location and the manager decline what i brought because their is no more room. So yes im piss friday 11/20/2020. I want to suggest that whoever is answering the phone should have knowleged in the rules for donating furnutre(what they dont take ,limited space for furniture, or time that they take furniture.). This would avoid having to take my donation back with me to unload after i loaded it by myself. Very inconvenient for me.</text>< pictures>

My husband and daughter dropped off some very nice items to this store on Sunday afternoon 8-25-19.  My daughter accidentally gave them my patio chair cushion I had in my car.  This cushion matched my other 4 chairs in the set.  They go back an hour later and the employees would not give it back to them nor let them look for it!  I WILL NEVER DONATE TO GOODWILL AGAIN!<//Review>

<review>I always enjoy browsing through thrift stores. Goodwill always has an interesting selection of second hand items. My latest purchase was an office chair. It is in good condition and I only paid $8.50 for it. I have been using it at my desk and it works quite well. Goodwill has a color of the day and that color is half off. They also have a selection of Halloween items if you are interested. Goodwill is a good place to purchase clothing and shoes. With a little perseverance, you can find some pretty good bargains for these items. They also have an electronics department with a variety of used radios, lamps, VCRs, headphones, DVD players, coffee pots and other useful things. It is always an adventure shopping at Goodwill. The employees are very nice and helpful. If money is a little tight, Goodwill is a good place to go!!!</review><user>113174002022486581286</user><Gmap_id>0x80dc9bc07bed5a9b:0x1eb7da8a67383f46<//Gmap_id>< pictures>

The clothes come in a viarity of styles, sizes, colors, and designs. Almost all items have a tag with a specific color. They will have signs telling you what the color of the week is, and if the item/s you have selected have that color it will be on discount. There are dressing rooms included. The bathrooms are in the right-hand corner at the back of the store. You can find heels, sneakers, boots, and other types of shoes. If you have things you don't need just laying around in your home, you can donate it. It's all very affordable.< /Review>< Resp>

Goodwill is a for profit organization. They don’t donate any money to any charity. Their CEO makes in excess of $1M a year.
If you want to donate, choose a charity place like Salvation Army or Angel View. Their income actually goes to charity.<//text>

My son and I love to browse the nic•nacs here. The staff is always friendly and on Mondays- they have a military discount and Tuesdays is senior discounts. Every week they have a "color of the week" any item that is the color is only $1. This lady last week- went in and got 3 tvs, kitchen table, chairs, 2 couches, entertainment center, dressers, lamps...pretty much everything she needed to furnish a home- and spent  $38 bucks. Insane!< /text>

I donated a ton of stuff, then I decided to go in. I was looking for t-shirts etc and I was informed all the sizes are mixed, well I didn't have all day to look, so I left. And I won't be back. It's Rediculas to think someone could look through all those racks just to possibly find 1 shirt. Bad marketing, bad displaying,  bad idea .</Text>

Ok.  So their clothing is sorted nicely by color and the store has a good appearance upon enterring.  However, they are insanely overpriced!!  Some items are decent, a lot are broken/overused.  It's Goodwill...these items were donated (for FREE!!).  Yet the price tags are reminiscent of a high-priced antique shop.  I'll never step foot in there again!< /review>

<review>Goodwill has way more stuff than they have room for, it gets donated by the truck loads, so why do they jack their prices up so much? When they have there $1 day everything else should be 50% off, maybe they could move more items out to make room for the incoming items......IDK I guess it just makes since to me.<//review><userid>112223457770532998229</userid>< Rating>

<Text>Laotian/Hmong flair in their Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese dishes. Asian food for the area. If recommend any larb/pad ka pow type dishes, soup dishes like their pho or seafood spicy dish. Don't expect much service. If you fine in a large group, I recommend ordering when you are ready vs group because the kitchen probably can't handle 1 large order.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

When I'm in town this is my go to restuarant for beef larb, deep fried tilapia, sticky rice and thai tea. The food taste great and the flavor is consistent. I don't go during their rush hours because they don't have enough staff to handle the volume. The waitress/cashier person is very friendly and accommodating since my two girls are picky eaters. I didn't give them a 5 star because my recent visit made me aware that either the prices have changed and it wasn't updated on the menu or I accidentally paid someone else's tab of $82. Please pay close attention to your tab to avoid mix ups because I was already on the freeway I didn't go back to question it but it still bothered me.</review>

Been coming here for years. Always a stop when I visit Merced. The beef larb is delicious. The combo pho has good broth and plenty of meat and seafood.< /review>

We've gone a four times, and each time it got worse. This last time was the absolute worst service I have ever received. When we came in there was a party of 12 and us (2 and child). Right after we ordered an appetizer the large party received their food, so they weren't really holding anything up for us.

We ordered our food and a hot tea. The foot came in a timely manner, but the hot tea took 40 minutes. We never received a refill on our waters, and waited about twenty minutes for our server to come back so we could get boxes. There was a lot of noise coming from the front room, so I figured they were busy. I eventually went to the front to ask for a few boxes, and I was right they were busy. The two servers were busy chatting loudly with some guy who brought in KFC. I asked for boxes and went to pack up. My husband went to ask for a to go cup for his hot tea, and the server rolled her eyes at him.

When I asked for a manager, it was made clear there was none. I proceeded to tell the servers about how awful their service was, and how unhappy I was. I've been in the restaurant business since I was knee high, and this is not how you handle an upset customer. She laughed at me, and when I told her I would not be coming back she told me, "That's fine."

To be clear, I don't expect a lot. I expect to see my server at least once or twice during the meal, to see other tables bussed (not left piled high with dirty dishes for an hour), and when there is an issue to see it acknowledged. I didn't even wanna refund, I wanted them to acknowledge their rudeness and apologize (at the very least).

Never coming back, and with service like that I'm surprised it's still open.</review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>I had an appointment here for my son's OCI application. I clearly told them that my current H1b extension is in progress, so I am going to submit my h1b receipt and my old h1b approval notice. The lady collecting the papers told just receipt is enough though. Then later after a week, they had put the application on hold due to insufficient documents! When I called the customer care, they told they definitely need my H1b approval notice. But when I went in person to the office, another reviewer told my H1b extension receipt and old expired approval notice is sufficient (the same thing I told them initially). Due to their lack of knowledge, application was delayed by around a week for no fault of mine!! Wish they knew the process much better!!</Text>< Pics>

I have been trying to reach customer service for my passport renewal as it is expiring. No one picks the call. Office phone numbers cant be reached. There is no information on the website as to what is happening. This scares me as to what happens if i need to travel. Whom can we contact in such situations. Extremely unprofessional way of dealing with things. Also the website has been made so difficult to understand and is confusing. Feel stuck.<//Text>

Such a bad service and I am left in total frustration. I have to get my passport renewed. For some reason I can not generate payment receipt and therefore not able to send my docs. Been trying to reach this ridiculous center for a week now via email but no response. On the top of it, I am unable to login and retrieve my application no more. But nobody to help about whatever the heck is going on. Call centers are closed.</text>

I'm unable to continue with the application. Starting the application from scratch didn't help. Please help.

Worst Service, My daughter passport will be expiring in 10 days. Fedex labels are not getting generated, if I tried to fill new application giving error message as already your application is in progress.

First the phone number had a busy tone. Now the phone message says "you've reached a non-working number, error code ..." etc. And calling the 1-800 number merely tells you that these are the working hours, but that the office is closed - when you're calling within working hours! And no one responds to the trouble-tickets raised on their site. I'm at my wits end to get a passport renewed. Help!<//text>

Even when I get feedback, the response is incomplete/not clear, despite asking the question clearly. We pay for these services ... and expect better.

<review>They kept our 1 year old son's oci application 'on hold' twice asking us to resend the photograph. The photograph we sent was perfectly fine and it was accepted by the indian government website, not sure whats the deal with CKGS. CKGS wont respond to emails nor their customer care phone number works to enquire about the issue. Indian government should really look at all the negative feedback, reviews about CKGS and take appropriate action. Agencies like CKGS bring down the reputation of the nation and India should really consider getting rid of CKGS, they only bring agony to indians living overseas.< /review>< user_id>

Very bad service. They charge $30 for shipping service. They receive the application and take 5 days to send to Indian Consulate. Consulate approves the application in a couple of days and send that to CKGS. Then CKGS sits on it for 5 days doing sorting. And I have no idea when they will send the documents back to me. Pathetic Service. Hope Indian Government finds some other company. Their phone number does not work and customer service has no idea. This is the company that is employed by the Indian Govt., seriously? They dont care about any urgency or emergency someone might be facing. Modi jee, please fire this company.<//Review>

I agree with all of the reviews. No phone numbers work. It is always busy tone. I applied for OCI and suddenly because of lockdown, now they only want the application to be mailed. Their emails are vague on all the answers and never clearly mentioned on process. Very sad to deal with incompetent people.< /review>

Sent CKGS a queried regarding a mistake I made on my OCI application on July 12th 2020.... no response from them as yet.  Have sent two more queries, hopefully they will respond. When you call the number given in their response email the response is this number does not exist. Why post a number then?  Wonder why the bad service??<//Text>

The OCI card is worthless. Save yourself the trouble and just get a 10 year visa. This whole process is confusing and not well thought of.<//text>

<Text>This is absolutely the worst service I have gotten from an institution in my entire life. They never responded to any of my emails or phone calls.Online application is confusing on what should be entered in the application form. They send me a vague email stating i have my name and passport issued date entered incorrectly in the application form, so they are rejecting my application. I double checked multiple time on my name and the passport issued date, but it was exactly the same as it was in my passport. After a week or two later I got an email saying that they are sending me back my rejected application form and charging me service fee(even though they did nothing to help me to clear the issue) . These people have absolutely no responsibility on helping people by any means.</Text>< GmapID>

<Review>I spent a whole day fighting with the confusing system in order to apply for my Indian passport renewal.. Please improve it.
It's extremely hard to figure out how to navigate the process. There is too much information displayed, which is confusing.
The website itself has two pages on how to use it- "Passport- How to apply", and "Passport Application Guide"- this should be a hint that it's hard to use it. A well designed website would not need any user guides.< /Review>< UserId.>

Follow instructions exactly as given, you will face no issue. Don't expect any flexibility if your docs are not correct. Otherwise it is very quick service.< /Review>

Hi, During this COVID lockdown please advise if still walkins are encouraged and appointments can be taken. If not, is it safe to send the passport and application via fedex and get the process move forward smoothly. Kindly advise. The site says operating between 9 am to 10 pm EST and the phone number provided also does not work.<//Text>

<Text>Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi should and must Fire everyone working for this agency.
This is the worst service Indian Government provide to their citizens resides overseas in the USA.
The customer service is completely incompetent and ill prepared to provide basic answers on visa applications. On top they charge like call center for information. The process to complete online application is so confusing and so outdated with questions. You have to submit pre payment information with type of payment and check number for money order or cashiers check, etc.
The agency should review and model passport visa renewal process with other western countries or better yet follow USA simple application process.
The Government of India has lots of young bright computer programmer and believe even college students can write easy computer program to process then CGKS.
I hope Indian Foreign Ministry read this review and take decisive prompt action. This is simple MONEY GRAB agency.<//Text><username>Nirav Desai<//username><UserId.>110700829044323273539<//UserId.><resp>None</resp><pictures>None< /pictures><GmapID>0x80858089e112152b:0x3a62c42a75a8ad7f</GmapID>< Rating>

Today June 05, I had an appointment with CKGS for my passport renewal...I came all the way from San Jose taking half day leave from office. Reached CKGS SF office and waited for 25 mins at their door. They didn’t open door at all. When I knocked, someone came but instead of opening door, just ignored me. Note on their door says, they open door only for Fedex and UPS.

Considering Covid-19 situation, I understand if they want to process applications via mail only. But then CKGS  should not give appointments. They don’t receive calls either. I scheduled appointment on June 1 for June 5 as their website showed we will open office from June 1.

This one mistake from CKGS has cost me $150 uber and my 3 hours of friday morning is just wasted for nothing.</text>

My experience with CKGS was very good.

1st - I had issue with finishing application first time and when I send email to them, they were very prompt and provided right direction.

2nd - Online application initially seem daunting but once I started to fill, it was relatively easy than I thought earlier. Make sure you keep your photograph ready to upload. You have to resize it.

3rd - I checked and marked all checklist items. During dropping off application front desk lady was helpful and didn't face issue at all.

4 - Representative at application acceptance counter was helpful as well.

5 - After dropping off received visas in 4 business days. Also got few emails regarding status update of visas.

Thanks< /review>

They reject applications for the silliest reasons that are actually immaterial to the content of the application. Then they make you apply over and over and collect $$. There's no way to edit certain details online after they reject your application so in order to reapply you have to waste time trying to get someone on the phone. Wasteful service.< /review>

Surprisingly smooth experience. Was in and out in 10 mins for an OCI application with appointment. Just make sure you read all the instructions and take the docs. The website and the instructions are scattered across so it’s a pain to get it right the first time. Nevertheless this centre as such had no issues for me.</text>

Overall, it was a very smooth process for me. CKGS team is very experienced, quick, supportive and they know their stuff very well.

Few tips: Read the instructions carefully, follow checklist, if you walk-in, go early morning and check their holiday list before walk-in.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Passport has been received for a week - then no update. 0 progress - they don't even have time to verify it, and move the process along. God knows when i will get my passport. I have to travel in couple of weeks, and this process is probably going to make me miss it.

And god forbid if you try to call their contact center. They ask for a credit card, so that they can charge you 2.5$ per minute for a call center in India. Never met more unprofessional company.

I guess all the competence of Foreign Ministry passed away with Mrs. Sushma Swaraj.</review>

There's no status change or anything shown in the website. We're very very anxious and if we don't know what's the status, we don't know what to do about the wedding.
The biggest mistake that we did was not going through tatkal. Please let me know if we can change it to tatkal or if there's a way to fix this.

They officially useless. They ask for so many documents, charge you more than any other embassy,  then take 0 responsibility for your approval. They are slow and they are not educated enough to know what is even in their site. They give you a template but they dont even accept their template. Worst experience ever. -5 star. I got rejected for (their own reasons) which doesn't make any sense. It just means you are treating Indian Government's validity by your irresponsible application process.<//Text>

Interactive pages for entering pertinent information are made by very incompetent IT people. I have spent a lot of my time trying to fill it and failed. There is no button or field to click and save the partially filled form for the OCI/renunciation application. I have been in USA as and American citizen for about 50 years and have never come across such a horrible interactive form. I feel ashamed of my country where I was born. I am a retired NASA scientist of international reputation.< /review>

My experience is mixed. The staff who dealt with me was cooperative. Information regarding supporting documents is not available in some cases like addition of spouse, correction of Father and Mother name. Their checklist which is provided on filling their online form is not complete for the services requested.

The staff works at this palce is horrible and they dont know the details of the legal system and on top of it their website is the worst website which never gives you proper information

My application got rejected on very minor issue and they send it back to me after deducting the amount from the fees i paid. I was never given a chance to fix it

Now yesterday my new application got hold with new silly reason that i have to.pay them for shipping but unfortunately the staff is so dump that they are not able to find the prepaid return label which i send to them

They dont have any contact details so that you can call them and explain
Also the help center number given is directed to call center located in India and if you call them then another horrible story

They just want you to pay them, they are only looking for money....

Guys have some extra money for unnecessary charges which they will ask for...... only money matters to them not your application as they are outsourced company by Indian Consulate.

I am waiting for them to reject my application second time and then i will take the matter in consumer court in a legal way

And will also ake this matter to the Indian Foreign ministry office and to "Subrahmanyam Jaishankar" External Affairs Minister of India

If you have any complains on them then please reach out to Subrahmanyam Jaishankar or tweet her on tweeter so that others dont have to pay them for  all unnecessary charges< /text>

<review>Worst Visa application process ever. It took me 2 days to understand their weird online process. Then again the information was incomplete. The single star is due to courtesy of the front desk at this center. This reminds me of the days of dealing with bureaucracy in India 15 years back. Indian government should make Visa applications simpler. Outsourcing to CKGS does not absolve them of the responsibility to provide good experience to people who want to visit India.<//review>< pics>

This is harassment. They literally got me to tears to fill up the application and send it to them. They have made things and process soo hard that its impossible to understand.  Never in my life have I ever come across such a horrible interactive form. Its a shame. I wish I never had to deal with them.

In the end they rejected. No questions, no suggestions. Just rejection and returned.< /review>

<Text>Horrible service, they keep asking to submit documents again and again that too one at the time and spend more on shipping cost and resubmit the payments already made for the services. There is no clear verification process it seems as they keep requesting one document at a time. Also they keep charging for same application re-submitted again.

There is no clear timeline given on refund processing and its timeline. The tracking number provided is also incorrect for refund. My case ID is 04152786, look into it.< /Text><GmapID>0x80858089e112152b:0x3a62c42a75a8ad7f<//GmapID><UserId.>105949597999934542185< /UserId.>< Time>

<text>Passport renew for kid

9/20/2019 - Horrible service. Lady on counter was very rude... I gave 1 star.
10/03/2019 - went again. Same lady was nice this time and it took 5 min to resubmit the application. Going to revise it to 4 star.

The mistake I did first time was - The print out from govt site came on 6 pages. As per CKGS, it should come on 4. I dont know how it got printed on 6 but it was not mentioned anywhere to ensure that govt form print out should be on 4 pages. So ensure this thing before going.

Major disappointment was CKGS call center. I talked to them for 3-4 min and they charged me $27. I think charges start from when you dial the call center number including wait in calling queue. Think before you dial CKGS call center number.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Wish I could give them zero for their services. I applied for an OCI ( I regret it now). First they had issues with the photo I uploaded when I sorted that out by myself without their help, then they did sent me my OCI card with incorrect birth place. Mind you I sent THREE DOCUMENTS stating my place of birth, but apparently they cant read. Every time you ring the helpline they don't know anything and they blame everything on you.Seriously how is business even allowed to run?<//text>

Very very very helpful staff !!
They helped me through my application for my passport and provided guidance wherever I asked for.
I had a pretty difficult time after my passport was stolen but CKGS was forever helpful and replied to any query I had over the phones/email/in person.
They made it very smooth for me and were very accommodating.< /review>

My experience with CKGS so far has been very positive. I applied for a passport renewal for myself and a tourist visa for my wife recently with successful outcomes in under 2 weeks for both cases.

The application process is definitely very convoluted with many documents to submit and having to go to the CKGS website first followed by the government website and then back to the CKGS website. However, once all the documents were submitted, the rest of the process was very smooth. There were automated notifications that kept us posted about how the application was proceeding. I got the passport back in less than 2 weeks (including weekends).

The visa application was submitted under a tight deadline as we were traveling in 2 weeks and our e-visa application had been rejected just then. I called CKGS through out the process to see if the application could be expedited and was able to connect with someone every time without any wait (other than navigating through the endless menu). Though they couldn't help me expedite the application, they were very patient and explained what and when to expect things to happen. I also dropped by the CKGS office in SF and the lady at the front desk was very helpful in answering my questions. When we were about 2 working days away from our travel, the lady understood our situation and said that she would take a note so her manager can send out an enquiry to the consulate. Luckily, we got the visa the same day before they had to send out the enquiry.

Overall, we had a very positive experience with CKGS and I would like to commend them for their professional service.< /review>

Their service is really horrible and inefficient. The general process and system should be updated/changed properly so that people can use this service more conveniently ......<//review>

Awesome service. The reception lady is very patient and answers all your questions. I showed up on Thursday and said I am traveling on Tuesday and she said pickup on Monday. Without delays they processed my application.<//text>

Not sure how to thank CKGS for the faster service. Fully satisfied and happy with their service. In just 5 days was able to get my work completed. Appreciate your work and the way you keep applicants posted with status of the apllication is much appreciated.< /review>

<Review>This one star is for the broken process. The UI for application process sucks. Lot of duplicate information needed to be filled. Instructions are hard to understand. Once you submit the application, there is no update on when to expect visa. The Website timeline changes without informing customers. Call center is very hard to reach. I hope to see the process improved :-(</Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< user>

Overall good experience.
However, I do want to share one unpleasant thing that could have been avoided.
I sent my visa application in a PERSONAL envelope along with correct UPS shipping label v/s the ORIGINAL UPS envelope (paid for full shipping online) . Later, I was charged extra $18 for "Wrong Packaging"  .

** No where on CKGS website it says that applications can't be sent in personal envelopes  **

This information would have come handy to save me some time and money had I known before.< /Review>

I applied for reissue of passport for name change. I received it today and found out everything is blurred and the details on last page are overwritten. The picture is tilted and the the font is so dull, as if they ran out of ink. It is so pathetic that i will have to reapply for reissue again. Such unprofessional people that they don't understand how important a passport is in a foreign country. I spent almost $200 on the whole process, plus the phone call charges. I need to apply for H1B visa with my new passport in few weeks and i am not sure i can do so with this literally damaged passport. Though i am not sure is it CKGS fault or the embassy's fault. But anyone should've verified the passport before dispatching it. I am not sure what i am not going to do now.<//Text>

Pathetic service. Applied for passport renewal at the San Francisco office and they misplaced my passport. I had to track it down on their behalf. The customer service representatives had no idea where my passport was, lied to me saying it is in the consulate while in reality it was with some lady in Arizona. Charged me $157 for calling them. I had to call because they messed up. Its been over a month that I am following for the refund of my money, but all they say is  "there is no timeline defined of this procedure" . Does that mean they will take years to give my money back? It is unfortunate that we have to deal with such agencies.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>This agency is a joke. They don't have a clue on processing a simple Indian visa application. I've traveled to more than 50 countries and obtained other country visas more than 20 times in the last 5 years but I haven't seen anything this unorganized and chaotic as the Indian Visa application process. If everything goes fine you're lucky, but if you end up making a small mistake (such as entering San Francisco for place of passport issue instead of USDOS) on your application, you'll be spending 2-3 hrs of your valuable time with the CKGS customer care reps. Every time you get a different answer based on who you talk to at CKGS customer care, and finally they will ask you to cancel your application. The cancelled application with your Passport will arrive after another 5 business days. Also, upon cancellation, they will forfeit all the application processing and shipping fees and you'll get half your money back after 10 days.  And you start all over again with this incapable agency since you don't have another option to reach the Indian Visa gods sitting at the Embassy.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1559247670516, 'text': 'Dear Applicant,\n\nWe request you to share your contact, application details and experience at cs.usa@ckgs.com to better assist you.\n\nPlease mention the link of this post and case Id: 04006678 in your email.\n\nRegards,\nCKGS USA Team.'}</response><gmapID>0x80858089e112152b:0x3a62c42a75a8ad7f< /gmapID></record>

Due to a visa emergency, we applied for a passport renewal under Tatkal. As per the online instructions we sent the email with all the requested documents and nothing happened for a week. After a lot of follow up and spending a lot of $$$ on the paid customer service calls (Yes, you have to pay by minutes to customer service) and many many attempts finally we figured out that **total** email attachments cannot exceed 2mb and we have to send multiple emails (each <2mb) to send all the required documents. Once Tatkal was approved, the usual drama of rejecting the documents for no reason started. Unfortunately, there is no way to escalate this since the online feedback is broken on Indian Consulate SF mission's website and the only way to communicate with Indian Consulate is via CKGS.
I wonder why the process is outsourced a private company if it's equally bad as any Indian Govt agency?< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>CKGS website is one of worst online portal for passport renewal application. To start with few things:

1. Language is super confusing on the website.
2. There is conflicting information at times and FAQs are not really helpful.
3. There is no Live Chat assistance provided for customers.
4. The so-called customer help service number charges the customer after first five minutes of the call. I am like "Are you serious??". Please don't call it Customer help service if you are charging customers for a valid enquiry or feedback call.

My husband applied for a passport renewal application online and attached all the supporting documents along with the original passport and the checklist as mentioned on the website. Once CKGS receives the application, it is natural that they are going to review it. Once they review it, if there is a missing document, they email you with the information (which is fair enough).
But the annoying part here is they email you the missing document one by one. That means, for example "document A" is missing, they are going to email you that Document A is missing and please return it within 7 days. Once you send the document to them via FedEx or UPS ( which causes a shipping fee of $15-$20 approximately from your pocket), they start reviewing again. Again they find something missing, they send you an email with a deadline of 7 days. So again you end up paying for UPS or FedEx shipment to send your document one by one. This gets too pricy.

Feedback:
1. It would be great if they could review the entire application and send the list of missing documents if any via email. The entire process can be made as ONE SINGLE STEP instead os series of back and forth.
2. The website can provide a Live chat assistance for customers
3. Please stop charging customers on the customer service call. That just doesn't sound fair.

My husband's passport renewal is still on hold with the status "Missing/Incomplete document" and I am still calling the customer service getting clarification on what is missing and being charged on my credit card for the number of minutes they put me on hold to get the correct information.

This service is ridiculous and I will not recommend this to anyone.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1562758809652, 'text': 'Dear Sonali Vishwakarma,\n\nWe request you to share your contact, application details and experience at cs.passport@ckgs.com to better assist you.\n\nPlease mention the link of this post and case Id : 04066500 in your email.\n\nRegards,\nCKGS USA Team'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Second, unless you have 2-3 months and lots of free time to continue to resubmit documents either via the mail or walk in... this is a long process. As someone that lives in the bay area near the office in SF walking in was easy, but it required me being late to work or trying to leave in the middle of the day to submit paperwork.

Third, they require your actual passport to be sent and documents that you have submitted online may or may not be accepted at the embassy. You photo MUST be a professional passport photo.and you need copies of everything you filled out online just in case.

Four, the instructions were far from clear, and its multiple pages of information as if you are applying for a passport in the USA including a reference in the states and in india to get a visa.

Five, of you need to call in for anything, you will be charged for the call by the minute.

I'm posting this today because the total cost of 3 weeks of my life and time wasted was $212.90 and I had to withdraw my passport because I am traveling some place in 4 days and they have once again asked for another document with no clear timeline on me getting my passport back before I leave the country to go to Japan. Is a refund possible, currently I dont know... would I love one, yes! Because it's been a headache trying to figure out the online app and get everything in just to get a damn visa. Will I be traveling to india, probably not since it requires shots, a visa, and lots of patience that I am currently lacking after this experience.

Edit: 10/05/2019

Just learned this company is going out of business in Europe and will be shutting down. They told my best friend her visa had cleared but because of all the issues I had she checked the india site and she found that she was not cleared for her visa. We will be visiting the Indian consulate in Japan for her to attempt to correct it.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>This Agency.... i don't have any idea who runs it. It is all about looting money from the applicants.
Point 1 : their check list need to be simple and clear... should not be confusing(notarized in color). where it would be done in COLOR.... !
Point 2 : where ever the signatures are  needed, it should be clearly mentioned how many people should be signing ? (parents one/both or kids etc)
Point 3 : if there are missing documents(except color difference) or information it should be consolidated completely and sent to the applicant.  Should not be looting public by charging $15 for document one after other.
Point 4: The Worst part is "Charging for Customer support call to check on the confused application status". As per my knowledge any American Resident/Citizen has the RIGHT TO KNOW .

My basic question/doubt is... whether this whole process is happening in America or some where in remote India village.

I have never faced this type of problem/process with either Mexico, canada, US or singapore visa/passport applications.

I appreciate if any US Organisation/department looks over this messy process and control them so that the public would be saved from getting looted hundreds of dollars for each application.

<text>CKGS charges applicants if you call their customer service no. ending in 5431. They charge a whopping $2.59 after the first 5 minutes which is "free." I have never heard of being forced to pay for asking questions. Nice joke< /text>< Resp>

<text>This company is the worst company to deal with. I have tried to get a visa to attend business review in India and my travel date was 11/8/14-11/16/14. I could not attend my business review and I had to cancel my trip and lost out money on non-refundable ticket. These people are incompetent. When you call, you get a call center in India and it takes waiting on hold for an hour to get through. They know nothing. Just try and get a phone number to the office here in San Francisco! Absolutely unbelievable how much time I have wasted on phone calls, FedEx and still no visa. I have also miss out on a business trip to Europe and my passport is still stock over there with them. I am about to take a trip to San Francisco on 12/11/14 to get my passport back since I need to travel to Europe 12/15/14. My passport has been with them since 10/20/14. I am not sure how India govt can take a pride in dealing with such an incompetent company with such a bad reputation. I am also advising my company to move our business away from India and placed them in Philippines where you do not get any issues with visa going over there. I guess they don't want you to do business in India. Way to go Cox and Kings! Completely useless and hopeless company.<//text>< Rate>

<Review>This the worse company I have ever dealt with. I applied for OCI and got my photographs done by a professional. They dont accept those photos that I uploaded online then they send me instructions about how fix the photo and I did it, but they still dont accept it. Their helpline is useless. They dont know anything. There is no case manager so you cant directly talk to your case manager regarding your case. Absolutely useless. :(  :(</Review>< pictures>

<review>Applying visa for India is nightmare. CKGS service is horrible, unprofessional, I have no words to describe. Confusing website, rude employees, no phone support, longest hold time and you have to keep pressing 1 every 10 seconds while on hold, if you don't press 1 after waiting for an hour every 10 seconds you will be disconnected. It's time for Indian govt to replace CKGS and there rude and unprofessional employees.</review>< Pics>

<Text>We went for a walk in visa submission for our daughter. Though we were a bit late for the walk in window, the lady at the entrance helped us in getting the token and submitting the application. The person at the documents collection was quick and courteous. He checked everything promptly and told us about missing parts, which were able to rectify and submit again soon.

I was expecting to get the visa in 3-5 days but i reached our home in 2 days, which was very quick and useful, as we were traveling soon.<//Text><GmapID>0x80858089e112152b:0x3a62c42a75a8ad7f< /GmapID></record>

In the recent years, Indian Government run services in India have been exemplary in efficiency, timeliness and consistency.  Indian e-visa processing is exceptional.  Kudos!

On the contrary service quality have gone decades back with vendor CKGS ...

During the peak morning hours only two counters have clerks, taking long breaks between tokens. Only active person was the one that caters to agents.

Poorly trained and arrogant staff of CKGS is a good example of what not to do, in a customer facing business. There seems to be utter confusion between what is online functionality of CKGS and what's in-office. Divide is so vast that it seems like beneficiary of online processing fees is different from in-office.

During my multiple visits to CKGS office in San Francisco,  CKGS employees never cease to amaze me with their crafty words. Favorite phrases are "CKGS online issues are not CKGS office staffs problem. Cancel that form and file another one for me to help you here", "Passport issuing location should be USDOS not California, Cancel this form file another one".  "I don't care, if you lost the passport, you should provide me a copy.", "I know you submitted this document with your other application, but I can't give you a copy"

And new favorites last month, as I waited helplessly for someone to provide me an answer.:
"You started online, I CANNOT help you"

And for 9:00 AM to 11:00AM walk-in advertised on web:
"You cannot walk-in, I don't care what website says"
"I can accommodate walk-in but you will be charged extra $17"
"You are not allowed to walk-in, unless you make an appointment"
"Walk-ins are only allowed for people, you have made an appointment"

Entire staff seems to be fresh off the boat this year, with no language distinction between "Sa" and "Sha". It's a good case study for Customer Support students.<//review>

<Review>Great experience here while getting an emergency visa to visit my sick mom in India. Once the receptionist looked at my proof of emergency (letter from my mom's doctor) I was bumped to the front of the line. I was seen within five minutes. The second clerk was also very thoughtful. Understood my situation. Sorted my paperwork without any hassle. I needed an extra photocopy. They did it for me and charged it to my card, no hassles. I got my Visa on the same day. Overall great experience in spite of my stressful day.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80858089e112152b:0x3a62c42a75a8ad7f</gmap_id></record>

Crazy people. They dont mention that tatkal drop off for documents is only between 9-11 am.

On the website they mention 9-11am and on email they mention 9-3:30 pm. I went there at 1pm and they will not accept my application.

The lady helping me was chewing gum like a buffalo and had golden hair (mojave hari color)
04024994

UPDATE: the lady working apparently did not knew the difference between different tickets, you see when you take a ticket at the kiosk, each one comes out with a different starting letter which specifies if you are dropping of incomplete docs or submitting a new application.

She mistook 'D' for 'A'  and said cannot take my docs at 1pm. I called customer service twice got charged $13 (total 26) and customer service calls me back yesterday with apologies.

I should be refunded.</text>

5 star rating for the services offered in the CKGS office, while less than 1 rating for the so called 'Public parking' facility in the basement. Went there today to renew passport and office work was done in less than 15 minutes. No rush, total breeze.
On the other hand, parking was a nightmare. They don't have the parking rates displayed up front and only have 'Public parking' placard. It is a very narrow alley to go to the basement and at one time, only one car can either come in or go out. Considering it is a public parking, we drove down and found out that the rate for parking was $20 for 0-1 hrs, $32 for 1-2 hrs. I tried to take a U-turn and leave from there, without parking, but the narrow alleyway was packed, so I had to pay $20 and park there.
The parking attendant literally laughed on my face and showed me the exit door when I pointed out to him that they should have parking rates displayed up front. This is unethical business practice and they are duping people knowing that once someone drives in, it is difficult to get out.</text>

All along we were constantly updated via email regarding the status. The customer service representative we interfaced with - Dwayne; was courteous, patient and extremely helpful. Dwayne was reassuring and helped in expediting the process by getting us a ticket/ reference number. You guys restored our faith on anything regarding processing for India!

I was pleasantly surprised with customer service at CKGS. I had already planned on my trip to India and needed to get a renewed passport before Feb. 9. I applied for the normal process because the Indian Consulate was very slow in responding back with approval for tatkal process. The receptionist and the lady at application processing desk at CKGS was very nice to let me know  that the processing is slow and I better go to Consulate to get approval for tatkal. She promised to help me when I get back with the processing without appointment when I get back from the Consulate. When I got back from the India Consulate with the approval (which was a pain) they helped me right way and got my application for passport renewal on the way. I hope to get my renewed passport soon! Thank you CKGS :)< /review>

The employees at CKGS are rude and incompetent. I would avoid going here at all costs unless absolutely necessary. One individual to be weary of in particular is Shanawaz Mirza. He is extremely hostile and abrasive towards applicants and will use whatever reason he can to avoid processing paperwork. I  witnessed him myself telling several applicants to come back at later dates because of simple errors with their paperwork. These were errors that could have been easily corrected in a short period of time (in other words that same day) however Mirza still insisted that people leave rather than come back even if they had corrected the errors. He claimed that it would be to busy to see them later and reprocess their paperwork. However the place was almost empty in the early afternoon (as it was on several other days) which obviously shows he is lazy, inept, and unwilling to do his job.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Average rating of 2 for both CKGS and the indian consulate tells the whole story on how pathetic the things are. Not sure why this centre is needed in the first place. They really don't know anything. Any questions other than the standard application process would not be answered. I had to run between the consulate and CKGS for two days. It would have been good to have this in the consulate itself. Why do you want this centre to be in the middle of a city where parking charges are just way too high. Good that I traveled using uber, but still wasted a lot of money and time by running between the two centres. Sorry state of affairs. A country like india should be able to do this on their own rather than through a 3rd party. This will save them as well as the general public a lot of money, time and effort.<//text>< pictures>

<rating>4</rating><Review>Hi All,

I want to share my experience with CKGS and their office in San Francisco. I applied for my son's(minor) Indian Visa through them. I was little skeptical first and told my husband to just ditch the visa altogether and apply for E-Visa instead, as I was not comfortable with sending my son's passport. I read so many bad reviews and it just didn't feel good. It took a little while for me to understand to application procedure through CKGS website and Govt. of India website, but once I got the hang of it I was comfortable. After the initial glitch the next problem I had was shipping. They gave me the option of shipping through UPS/Fed ex from Me(Alaska) to them (CKGS SF), but when I tried to opt for the same from them to me back it didn't gave me any option. I thought of using shipping form them both ways as they charged $15, but may be because I am in Alaska it just didn't work. But after talking to the customer service they told me to use USPS prepaid label instead. Well I sent the application and after that it was a smooth process. They updated the status regularly. Sent us text and e-mail for the same. Finally we have our son's visa for 10 years to India. Thank you so much CKGS San Francisco for helping.

<review>Indians are regarded as smart, hard working and successful.

Obviously none exist at this horrible service, nor in the IT department of the Indian consulates.

This will be one of the most painful visa applications of your life. Guaranteed.

Flaming incompetents. Date drop down has only six months. Cannot gomoutside of those. You will figure out eventually that you have to enter manually instead.
Make a mistake with date of birth and want to change it? No dice. You can edit almost everything in the ‘modify’ page, except your dob or nationality. Why? Ask these incompetents who designed the website.
You will have to submit an entire new application.

There are many more issues, such as ‘have you ever visited any SAARC country (apart from your own)?

Figure that one out.

They could hire a fresh grad and within a week he/she can give them a better website.<//review><response>{'time': 1528111140577, 'text': 'Dear Applicant,\n\nWe request you to share your contact, application details and experience at cs.usa@ckgs.com to better assist you.\n\nPlease mention the link of this post and case Id : 03318732 in your email.\n\nRegards,\nCKGS USA Team.'}</response>< gmap_id>

the website is so complicated. they ask you for your father's and mother's current citizenship status. there is not provision to input if they are deceased.  It is also mandating current permanent address in India. what If one does not have a permanent address ?  I was applying for renunciation of my Indian passport to get my OCI.  There is no way  to connect to a warm body when you call them.  Also due to some glitch I am not able to log in to my account.< /review>

<Review>Would give this 0 stars if it was an option. Our culture, our religion is so beautiful however our motherland is corrupted with this government that calls itself a "constitutional government." "Incredible India" is most definitely not incredible and I suggest no one visits this country as you may also be tortured without a reason.  We will not loose another innocent Sikh life due to this system.

Very poor web application process for Renunciation- The application asks for current passport and citizenship information (USA) and also for any other citizenship or passport (UK in my case)- Now I keep getting messages of "Missing Renunciation form" even though I have sent two copies to them twice now! They are now asking for a Renunciation certificate with UK details instead even though it initially asks for current citizenship/passport... the form can not be changed. Phone calls and emails have been no help- It has been escalated but all I get is "Missing Renunciation form" again and again with nobody to help me properly. The whole process is almost at 21 days and I will loose all fees paid due to terrible customer service</review>

<review>Site crashed with error "internal error" several times. Difficult to get back to saved applications - says unable to find application with the reference number etc. Overall unacceptable experience. Also the back and forth between the CKGS site and the Indian Visa site is awkward, information is not consistently communicated between the sites. It used to be simpler in the days one just visited the Indian Consulate, filled out required forms etc. and got a visa on the same day! I was hoping the online application process would be quicker, easier, and less expensive: it's none of the above.< /review>< rate>

{'time': 1548769045697, 'text': "Dear Applicant,\n\nWe have investigated on your case and observed that your “Middle Name on the Government Visa form” was missing in the initial application.\n\nCKGS is a mere a facilitator and we follow the strict guidelines laid down by the Consulate/Embassy. CKGS has been instructed to only accept applications that are complete in all aspects. Moreover, CKGS is charged a penalty by the Embassy if we fail to comply with the instructions by the Embassy and forward any incomplete/incorrect applications to the Mission. Hence your initial Visa application was not accept.\n\nWe are sure you realize that many people have the same names and therefore, missing initials or middle names is not a simple case. It is very important that you enter the name on the application exactly as per the supporting document provided (e.g. Indian/Foreign Passport). These rules are implemented by the Embassy of India and CKGS is obliged to follow the guidelines.\n\nWe also wonder whether you had clearly read the ’How to Apply' section (https://www.in.ckgs.us/visa/howtoapply) available on our CKGS website before starting the online form filling process. Our ‘how to apply’ section provides detailed instructions about the form filling procedure along with a Sample form for your ready reference.\n\nWe confirm that the refund for the rejected application was processed on Jan 24, 2019 after deducting all non-refundable fees applicable as per the CKGS terms and conditions accepted by you while completing the online application (https://www.in.ckgs.us/terms-and-conditions).\n\nUpon further investigation we understand that, you have submitted a new Visa application on Jan 25, 2019 and the same was placed on Hold due to Incorrect Information on the Additional Particulars.

This place disgusts me. The lack of professionalism is absolutely no where to be found. The people are very rude. Out of 6-7 station, only 1-2 are working. They don't answer any of your questions. They asked me to make a copy so I went to UPS next door, within 5 minutes the staff had left the premises and had gone home for the day. I came in at 11am with an appointment and I left at 3:47pm. Absolute garbage place. I would rather travel to a different state to get my visa than to come here again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME MAKING APPOINTMENTS. It's no use! After coming here, no one would wanna go to India after this rude experience.< /Text>

The worst services i ever seen.Its 6 months now, they returned  the passport with VAF tag,trying to contact every where to know about visa status and even online its just showing this VAF & passport delivered.

In 6 month they are not able to issue or update one person visa status.

I wish they can improve their services or Non US Citizen can apply visa from their own country.

I wasted my time and money to apply visa fro CKGS-San Francisco.< /Text>

Somebody should take action with this company. There is absolutely no accountability or ownership with this organization. Completely unprofessional and lackadaisical attitude.
My applications were rejected and the refund has still not been processed. Wait times on phone calls are ridiculously long. There system sucks. No way to trace applications: they get randomly deleted. No word yet on my refund status. Prepaid shipment is not acknowledged and emails to the folks get lost. It's a very frustrating experience. In this world and age of customer service, I am surprised these guys still exist.<//Review>

I had a horrible horrible experience with them. Initially I applied for renunciation certification at the counter. Not only did you lose my application, they told me I never submitted my application. It does not exist. That was such non-sense because I had all the receipts including web reference number. Later When I re-applied for renunciation, not only I had to repay the entire fees but I also had to pay $250 more including that  amount because according to this new timeline my renunciation application was considered late. POOR SERVICE!! VERY POOR!! I would give them a 0<//Review>

very bad service center. Only place where we have to pay to get service.

Nobody helps you unless you grab them by their arm and forcibly ask your question. I stayed at the facility from 9am to 6pm only to submit my visa application. Only to submit! So if you need to submit your application, show up at 6am and you might be helped. I paid them their $100 extra charge for expedite service because I had an urgent need to travel, it's been a full month I still haven't received my passport. They sent me an email saying "a document is missing/incorrect" and I need to submit the document within 7 days, but they didn't mention which document. So I went to the facility, spent 4 hours, only to find out that the email is automatically generated and I should ignore the email. So if you need to travel immediately, good luck!</text>< pics>

<review>ALWAYS  a frustrating experience to apply online for OCI. If it's not one issue, it's another at a different time. I always have to call them when I am  applying online. Even when my signature and picture is according to their  need, it doesn't go through. Now it keep saying that my passport  issue date need to be equal or greater than my date of birth when I indicated that my  birth country is in India. The temporary ID number doesn't let you get in even though it's accurate and the reason being the robot code I enter is wrong. When I finally called them I was told that the government website in India is down and try 3 hours later!
I have been dealing with them for the last few years, first to apply for OCI online and now to change my name and it is IMPOSSIBLE to have a a good experience on their sight. It is at a point where I am just going to give up! The website is INFORMATION OVERLOAD. The irony is India is known for their best programmers!!! I would give it 0 star for CKGS website including the government site!!< /review>< UserId.>

<Review>Worst service I have ever experienced.  The systems are derelict - if you upload one doc and then try to upload another one later, the system won't allow it b/c the price doesn't update from zero and they won't allow a $0 checkout ?!?.  Each customer service interaction starts from scratch and so you will waste hours in phone calls explaining why you can't have a Driver's License from India b/c you were 2 when you left 30 years ago.  And then their email system reviewers are probably the most incompetent team ever - you send over a doc, they say they got it but then immediately you get an automated response asking for the same doc.  If you send over multiple attachments they refuse to believe you and say they only received one.  Unfortunately you have no choice but to work through them, so stay patient and good luck.<//Review><username>Shiva Rajaraman</username><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I spent 4 hours in line just so they could check my documents that I filled out online. The website is buggy and I had to do the application 2 times. Once the document was checked I had to wait another 1.5 hours for them to collect my fee. I was told I had to pay an extra $100 because I was a walk in and considered an emergency visa. I went on Nov 4 and my flight was Nov 25, but the first available appointment was Dec 2. I was told I would have my visa in 48 hours. Today is Nov 12, I still have not heard from them and cannot get in touch with them. I will have to drive back to the city just to talk to somebody.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
We had no trouble in getting a visa for our minor child. The website and instructions are a little confusing hence minus one star. I read the FAQ, sample application, called the help desk a couple of times to ensure our application was complete and all the required documents were attached, notarized. I chose to take a appointment, but you can also walk in if an appointment is not available. The time for walking is 9 AM to 2PM. My husband was able to submit the documents and get out in half hour. They did not allow us to pick up the passport, so we ended up choosing FEDEX to get the passport back.We got periodic updates via email. We submitted my son's passport on Wednesday, the visa was approved on Thursday and we received the passport back on Monday. The process went super quick and smooth for us.</Review>

I know for a fact its correct. Lot of other people seem to experience the same issue.

If you call customer service, they charge you $2.69 per minute. Customer service sucks too - they have no idea about what's going on. I've spent so much money trying to get my issues resolved.

Filling out a simple renunciation+ visa application is taking 7+ hours(an still going) because of a website built by absolutely incompetent people.It seems their website and processes are just meant to punish NRIs for taking on citizenship of other country :(

Filing for green card was piece of cake in comparison to filing for tourist visa. They made easy process so complex. No clear communication. No one picked up the phone after calling 45 minutes.

Although I got my visa in 2 weeks without asking any additional papers. But this company is no good.

Indian government should snatch contract from this shady company.</Text>< Pictures>

Although your visit to CKGS may not feel like a five-star experience, I gave the highest rating because of how patient and accomdating the staff was with the crowds of people waiting in line and for their number to be called. I watched this one woman become completely unglued and unleash her frustration on the staff only to watch them patiently and delicately handle the situation without losing their temper or even raising their voice. Even I screwed up on my application and they were incredibly accomdating and let me not only use their printer but also jump back up to the front of the line (after already waiting my turn) to complete my application process. My hat goes off to the folks who work here, they work hard and do a great job.</text>

This company is literally is the worst!!!!! They did not tell me everything I needed to send in order to get my work Visa from India which kept delaying the process. I missed my trip even after calling everyday for 6 weeks to try and find out where my visa was. The only response i got was "no decision has been made." I've been told multiple times that they would contact me with more information and a realistic timeline but no one called and when I called I just got the run around. I would not recommend using the San Francisco branch to anyone. My family members back east got there visa in 3 weeks and had no problems.< /Review>

<review>They are completely incompetent. Not sure why Indian Government allows them to represent India.
I am sure anyone with minimum qualifications, work ethics and integrity could do a better job. I applied for an Indian visa for my family. We are all US citizens and travel regularly. Getting a Indian VISA has made our India trip a bad experience even before we get to India.....<//review>< UserId.>

I had a very good experience today at CKGS. Went to file Visa for me 1 month old son.

DO NOT go walk-in, they only allow appointments.

The lady was very nice and took all the documents from me and choose whatever was appropriate and minimum for the application.

I was free in less then 15 minutes.

Just read all of the instructions, everything is written in the instruction, somewhere.</Review>

Not only to me when I was there in office, I observed that they were trying to help each and everyone.

<Review>Calling their website and service pathetic would actually be giving them higher rating than they deserve.

I had web reference number and all documents ready but their system would not give me an appointment 2-3-5 months from now. Not sure what was wrong. it locates my application in the system but does not give any appointment.

No way to call them to get direction/guidance on what needs to be filled out< /Review>< Date>

I wanted to provide a better review than the ones I have seen lately.  Certainly, I had some problems. It was not a perfect process as expected, but a lot of the headaches come from the red-tape of the Indian government.

I went initially on Friday, and completed an application online.  I want to point out that the Indian lady at the front desk was extremely warm and friendly, as were many of the employees. She even printed out an application without charging me.  You can question  whether there should be a charge for this or not, but that is beside the fact.

On a negative note, one of the gentleman on Friday was somewhat rude. I had already been told that I could complete an application online. However, it took longer than expected because the initial attempt resulted in the application being lost and unsaved.  I started and finished but was pressured repeatedly and forcefully by the gentleman.  They should have not let me start, but the front desk lady was trying to be nice.

There was a slight mix up in the scheduling for the next day, but I was able to complete the application the same day anyway.  Again, the front desk clerk was extremely friendly and helpful.

The morale of the story is that one great customer service experience can make up for a few bad apples.

It seems like CKGS has taken the online feedback and tried to make improvements.  It still has a way to go, but I am glad it is going in the right direction.< /review>

Apart from the hassle of preparing, attesting multiple documentation, (taking care of each and every detail) which is applicants responsibility - every other aspect was managed and handled excellently and swiftly with CKGS. Greatly appreciate CKGS for managing it well.<//Text>< rate>

<review>THEY ARE USELESS, DO NOT USE THEIR INCOMPETENT "SERVICES".
Worst visa service I ever stumbled upon. Avoid this company by all means. Their "costumer service" representatives are sitting in India, without any direct communication with the guys in San Francisco. If you have any problems with the forms in San Francisco there is nobody to speak to. when trying to look for their contact information on the website,  they "hide" it from you under "feedback". I did not want to write any feedback, only ask questions regarding to the filling of the forms. Maybe they do not know what feedback is, so now here is my feedback. They don't have any email address to reach to, all is done through a feedback form. when calling the call centre, they "hide" the option of getting help from a representative, and only after listening to a long long recorded message with explanation about the website, after all the options, and after you pressed 4 different numbers, you can some how reach a representative. not user friendly and as if they are hiding away this option from you.

My employer address is outside of the US but their website would allow only US addresses (although the indian government website allows any address). I've been told by them on the phone to apply as an "unemployed" and "house wife" in order to get around it, although it is a lie because I do work.

I needed to fill out all the forms again from scratch cause their bad website would not let you amend any of the information that you enter in the beginning (the indian government website, by the way, does let you change the information, but the CGKS website will not). I applied for it all over again, just to realise that there is a discrepancy cause I am single.

Called them again. now they said fill out your home address as the work address. which I did, but then it seemed strange to fill home address as work, so I re-did the whole thing  and filled out as a freelancer (which I also am). then I payed and after payment saw that now they are expecting me to give a "journalist letter". I called them again and told them that I am not a journalist. So they said they will send me an example letter to my mail by 2 working days. 5 days have gone through and still no letter.

Calling them again, they say that I should wait two more days. I realised I might wait forever for this "journalist letter",  by that time i'm losing time and many days (every time you talk to them you need to wait one more days for a reply from San Francisco). So I realised if I will apply as an employed I will get around this letter. But I already payed, and in order to change I need to cancel it and re-do the whole thing. which I did, and they not give me the whole money back. they took some of it.

I applied for the whole thing AGAIN and sent it to them by mail. I sent it on a one-day ups in Thursday, but off course they received it only on Monday. Monday morning I receive a message that they have my forms, which lay on their desk for a whole day, only to get an email from them at the end of their work day, 4 minutes before the call centre closes, that there are "missing documents". It said that the name of my parents that I filled out in the india government form does not match to the other documents I provided. But I did not provide any documents other then that form that has their names...

I needed to wait another day, called them, they said they will ask in San Francisco and will give me an answer in 24 hours. I wait one more day, and a whole week passes by by the end of it I still don't understand what is the problem. they keep changing the information and not they want me to get a birth certificate (why does one needs a birth certificate for a visa????). Eventually they tell me that I need to cancel and reapply with my parents full name (the government of india form only asked for first name!!!).  By now my flight is coming near and although I've had more then a month when I started, now there is not enough time AND they had my passport.  now I have no visa and lost 3.5 weeks of stress with them<//review><Name>Raaya Adato</Name>< user>

Looks like they are working hard to improve customer experience, and trying to shed the sarkari babus' attitude usually associated with Indian Government's contractors. My experience with them always turns out to be better-than-expected and better-than-last-time.< /Review>

Do not ever mail applications to this office. I sent them all the proper documents with my both my old Indian passport for renunciation and my new U.S. passport for Indian visa. The geniuses claimed that they only received the Indian passport and nothing else even though it was all in one UPS package. And today, I received back the Indian passport and the u.s. passport in separate packages thru UPS with both containing notes that there was incomplete information. I want to know how they can first claim that they never received anything but the Indian passport but somehow they managed to send back both passports. Now I'm out of the fee that I paid and they didn't get any of the tasks done. I suppose they can be out of India, but the old Indians habits of stealing money and not doing anything are still hard to break.</text>

I have applied for passport renewal and I have got an update saying that there is a correction required in the passport application and I was asked to send the application again with the correction. Since I was asked to send the original, I had sent the corrected document to CKGS with FedEx overnight delivery. The document was delivered at front desk and someone from CKGS signed and received the document.

But it looks they lost the document and keeping the online status as if I still haven't send them. I did numerous follow on this. No one knows where the document is (though it is signed and received in CKGS office).

Every time I inquire, I had to explain everything but they don't answer where my document is though they agree on the fact that the document has been received and the next day, they will go from scratch on the status and say the document is not received. This is one of the worst services I have ever had. Still struggling with CKGS on this.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Will not give them any stars, absolute the most incompetent company I have dealt with.  They lie on the phone about the status of your application.  I sent in my passport for a visa, mind you I have had a visa in the past.  They said I need to go through the renunciation process, even though I moved to California when I was two!  I don't have a passport! Yes, I still need to surrender one?  When my visa was denied they still would not send back my passport.  I had to travel.  They lied and said my passport was on the way.  It wasn't.  Worst of all, when you call them, people in India who have no idea of what is going on, answer the call.  I will consider myself lucky if I never have to deal with them again.<//Text>

Compared to one year ago the service improved, but that's like moving from Stone Age to Middle Ages.

They have automatic tracking of your application, but the clerks are not trained on how to fill a correct application so you need to come multiple times for it.

The waiting time is shorter, but equally chaotic. It's unfortunate that the whole experience suggests it's a piece of India in San Francisco.<//Review>

<Review>I gave it a one star because that's the lowest i can give, i mean there are no proper direction on their websites. Their customer service is horrible, they do not give you any answers if you call them they tell you to refer to the website which is very badly structured. I expected good service since they outsourced it to another company but its still the same thing no change at all. very  bad.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>One of the worst service that I have ever experienced. I could have given negative 5 stars if there would have been an option. All the different parameters, such as, customer service and Website have plenty of issues in getting the simple things done. There is a lot of lot of wait on phone and connections breaks without any reason. No email response if you file a complaints. We're still working on my application with this center and will share experience in more detail. I appeal to government to improve the infrastructure and staff to establish broken system.< /review>< UserId.>

Quick processing if you've got all your documents in order. They've got some stationery (pens/glue) in case you need them. I had everything in order and didn't really have much trouble with them.<//review>

I will give the website and people working 0 Stars.  The experience is very horrible.  I submitted 3 applications... 2 for Visa and 1 for renunciation.  But, I am not able to either make an appointment or even login.  Everything it complains about wrong Web Reference, DOB and Passport Number.  You call them up and you are on hold... They force you to press 1 every time while you are on hold.  There was a time this process use to take 2 days max...  I have a trip coming up in Mid-Feb and I have a feeling that nothing will be done.  I wonder how Government of India got in this mess by outsourcing the business to this crappy company.< /review>

It's really phenomenal how bad and buggy their website is. I had to attempt my visa application 3 times before the website allowed me to complete it. They make you fill out several forms with virtually identical information on it, there are several different checklists telling you the steps of the visa process, each slightly incomplete and slightly different.

It's not like any of our reviews matter, though. There's not anywhere else you can go to get an Indian visa.<//review>

Good customer service, but faults in the website.  You have to read the fine print of the checklist.  When applying for children, the checklist states that the second page of the visa application must be signed by parents or legal guardians and must be notarized.  However, looking at the second page of the visa application, there is no place for parents or legal guardians signature.  Another thing is making a payment, you have to click on book appointment but if you have pop ups disabled, it will not do anything.  So the website needs a few improvements, but nothing terrible seriously, you just need to have a good scanner and a printer handy to get your documents ready for shipping.  Apart from that, customer service is always there to support, so I called a couple of times for assistance for documentation and also when my child's passport was put on hold.  One star removed for the not so user friendly website.</review>

Absolutely disappointed with such non-professional guys. They have no idea what customer service means. Eventually, I had to withdraw my application, but it still took ages (they said one week but now 4 weeks and no news) to get my passport back that resulted in the cancellation of two important meetings in other countries that almost ended up losing my job. My advice is: this level of frustration is never worth a visit to India. I am trying to get help from the law enforcement agencies to get my passport back.</review>

Pathetic customer service. It takes ages to get through their customer service phone line, and they forcefully disconnect you if the wait time is more than 15 mins (unless you respond to a ridiculous prompt that repeats every minute!). The application forms in the website are a joke, looks like it was built by someone who has no common sense at all!<//Text>

I actually had a great experience here, quite unlike most of the other reviewers. Everything went smoothly and I received my passport with an Indian tourist visa in it 8 business days after submitting the application (two days faster than they said it would take).

I followed the instructions on the Cox & Kings website exactly as they said and prepared all of the required documents. I booked an appointment online for 9am, showed up roughly 15 minutes before that, and went into this strange "pre-opening" room upstairs in an adjacent building that they have set up for people to wait before the actual office opens. This room had a LOT of people waiting in it, and I immediately though "oh crap... this is going to take all day." But then I showed my appointment confirmation to the attendant and got a ticket (people without appointments don't get these, so definitely make an appointment if you're submitting in person), then went downstairs to the actual office once it opened.

I waited there for about 15 minutes to see an attendant (the tickets are numbered and they call out the numbers one after another). It then took about 5 minutes with the attendant to submit my application and pay the fee. I was in and out within 40 minutes.

I received regular email notifications of the application process: receipt immediately after submission, notification of different steps of the process, and then a final notification with a tracking number when my passport was mailed out via Fedex.

I'm not sure why it went so badly for the other reviewers. Maybe it's only the people that have negative experiences that post here? Either way here's proof that it can actually go well at this place :)</Text>

<review>This whole process has been so ridiculously frustrating, that now I may not be able to make my business trip this week because I am still waiting on my Visa.  I am the only one out of 4 of us who doesn’t have their Visa at this point, and it would be nice to be able to talk to someone and get an answer on whether I should cancel my flights and hotels.  After questions about my passport, I submitted everything early last week and had no updates until I finally got through to someone last night and explained the situation (Ref USASV0038517), but they would give me no information and just told me to wait for an update from them.  That was after I had to wait on hold for HOURS and constantly pressing 1 to continue staying on the line or else getting hung up on.
It would be nice to get an answer, as I’m sure if the folks at CKGS were on the other side of the fence and had to deal their company, they would be just as frustrated.<//review><gmap_id>0x80858089e112152b:0x3a62c42a75a8ad7f</gmap_id>< resp>

I applied OCI for my son who is minor applicant through this center. Process was pretty smooth as they have document checklist in their website which is very clear and crisp. I had 10 am appointment on Wednesday morning and it hardly took 15 minutes for all document verification and sign off.

They even have computer system and printer if you forget any documentation and staff are really knowledgable and helpful. I would recommend to call their customer service and confirm all documentation you have before  going for your appointment else it will unnecessary add complications and ultimately you could avoid blaming CKGS. They even have mobile app and timely updates to your email.

Wish CKGS had processed Power of Attorney attestation too as it took me multiple trips to Indian consulate when I had done that directly.

Thank you CKGS</Text>

So we applied online for a visa for my infant child. Filled in the details as per their guidelines, but for reasons unknown, my child's middle name ended up showing on the printed form as '-NA-'. There is no way for us to edit this information - not manually, not through their website. And the 'Edit' feature on their website is a joke - an edit that doesn't let you edit. For over a week we've been on calls with their support staff to get this resolved, and till date, there has not been a resolution. We haven't been offered a service level guarantee of when it will be resolved either. Every time we call, we're being told to follow-up the next day. At this time, we're out of options, and re-starting our application process from scratch instead of having to deal with the support staff again. An advice to the CKGS management - please get your act together. A website to accept data filled in a form isn't rocket science, and this shouldn't be the experience an applicant has to go through, while availing your services.< /Review>

<text>There website needs a serious overhaul, there should be an option to visit any part of your application at any time in case there is a typo or you want to edit something later on, which is currently missing there.  But, their customer service is very nice, they will promptly respond to your concerns/ queries.<//text>< Pics>

Update: [changing from 1 start to 3 stars] They have been more responsive in the last couple of days. This review might have something to do with it. Nevertheless, I appreciate the improvement.
----
This is a very unprofessional organization, and frankly, I feel quite helpless that I cannot take any action against them. My OCI application has been pending with them for over a year now. After at least 10 calls to their help center, they asked me to send them scans of all the documents in September (I am assuming they misplaced my application). There was a death in the family and I had to get an emergency visa to visit India. Meanwhile, it has been 3 more months, and they have not provided any further update on my case. Wish I could give them negative stars!< /text>

<Text>Horrible experience.. Very frustrating and annoying.They ask for the same details again and again. They ask for copies of originals submitted along with documents. I wonder why they charge so much money just to feed some corrupt politicians..Shameful to say that I am an Indian. I expected a lot of changes with new government. Same old experience and sad part is more money. Should be never changing India not incredible India. Rotten system still sinks. I wonder who chose CKGS, not even BBB accredited. Perhaps some one who got lot of bribes. Indian administration never changes. Hope the external affairs and foreign ministries see this review.  I don't think they will care.<//Text>< resp>

I had walk in appointment at 12 PM, no queue. the lady in the front checked my documents. I missed annexure Form "E" and "Affidavit of change in appearance" for renewal, which she printed out for me ( extra cost) and asked to complete the form and handed me the token number. What a relief :) i had extra photo, glue and pen in hand, completed the form. Waiting area was empty, after 5 min wait time they called my number. The lady in the  window checked all my documents again and verified,  printed out the tracking ID. All done in like less than 20 min during my lunch break. Thats amazing. i saw the queue started forming up, when i was leaving the office. Lucky me :) Well done guys, keep up the good work.

Suggestion: I noticed that they had all the applications in the medium sized plastic boxes open next to the desk, i can see other's applications, their address, their pictures and  personal info. Thats dangerous Please store the documents in a proper way, Identity theft is a big deal.</Text>

Most incompetent and terrible company to get any of your oci needs. The web online application is a joke and just cannot get to a human on their published lines. The automated message is ridiculous - after clicking several options (mostly redundant) and hoping to get to speak to someone, the call disconnects itself.<//Review>

Bad service over all. The documents they require make no sense. The first day i walked in i got a list of documents required to get visa. I got all my documents and made an appointment the following day. At the day of the appointment I was given a different list of documents, which i did not have. They wanted my old Indian passport which I turned in 10 years ago after i got my citizenship. Since, I did not have that passport they wanted me to get a form notarized that i lost it! Also, they wanted me to get my birth certificate to insure that I am of Indian origin to which I did not how to react as I am a US citizen just wanting to visit india. Also, one of the workers told me that Last names such as Singh and Patel have a rigid process of visa compared to other names. This is pure discrimination. Last, I saw couple of people breaking down because they were being such a hard time.</text>

Never expected this from an Indian governed office or delegated agency to act so quickly, not even with the appointments!

I would recommend to take an appointment and plan to reach early because this office is located where there's hardly any parking. The parking in the same building charges $20 for first hour and price keeps goes up to $45 for 12 hours; cash! The CKGS office for passport renewal is on a different floor than the one on the main street; it's in the same building, just different floor.

Anyway, the staff was helpful and never expected them to be so soft spoken. I'm glad to say, I was wrong! There wasn't too much rush, still I was done with my work in max. 15 mins from waiting in line to submitting my documents for passport renewal and getting out.< /Review>

No wonder why CKGS has got such poor reviews. I had to renew by passport and had few questions to clarify while filling the details, so I called the customer care and guess what... 2 of the 3 guys that I spoke with were very rude and arrogant as if the customers calling them were illiterates and idiots.
They have a very tedious process with unclear instructions that often confuse the users filling up the information for the first time. They should either simplify the process or at least train the customer care employees to show some respect to customers and provide the information that was requested instead of judging the customers.</Review>

Got my Indian passport renewed through CKGS and the whole process was smooth. The instructions were very clear on their  website. I also had great experience in their SFO office. The staffs were kind and courteous. 10:00 AM was the appointment and about 10:20 my job was done. Received my  renewed passport within a week.
Thanks CKGS,  you are doing an amazing job..

To update,
I do see most of the negative reviews were due to to poor parking. This office has nothing to do with that limitation.  Come on friends, it is located in the heart of the SFO downtown and nothing is free there. I have reserved my parking space in advance, right under the basement of this building for just $8 for four hours.  Used the the Parkwhiz'.   I would recommend two modes of transport to this office for smoother experience. Use public transport or prebook your parking space if driving.<//Review>

Extremely poor web interface.  I have tried to submit my application for a tourist visa today two times.   Wasted 3 hours so far.   I have no idea if my application is being processed or not.  I would like a regular tourist visa for 5 years that allows multiple entries.   My prior EVisa expired in 15 months.     I tried to book an appointment for my first applications by hitting the appointment icon.   That got me nowhere.   It was a dead end.  How am I supposed to make an appointment?    Do I have to travel to the San Francsico office to make an appointment?   Do I call the SF office to make an appointment?     The website says that some centers don't book appointments online.  Next,    when I tried to print my application for ostensibly taking it physically to San Francisco,  I could not do so.     The inquiry page will not accept my reference number to help me print the application.  The message is my info does not match the database.    Screwy.< /text>

Impressed with the speed (entry visa for my 3YO son within 2 weeks including shipping transit). The customer care is good. I called several times during the visa application preparation and ckgs people are very nice and patient in answering all of my questions.
So why i had to call several times and why so many questions? Because the website design and underlying visa process itself is absolutely horrible. So much of confusion.
Example: The application (printed out from GOI site) needs to be notarized. It must carry thumb print of the toddler. Confusion is, do we have to notarize both parent's signature and thumb print of the kid or only signatures? because it's not easy to notarize thumb prints.
Why we have to go back and forth between GOI and CKGS sites. Can that process be integrated into same website with extra secure authentication.
SO MUCH CONFUSION at every step of preparation
So 5 stars for CKGS people
and 0 stars for the website and the visa process designers.<//Text>

Very bad service. Customer satisfaction is a distant thing for these folks. you keep writing to them or contact them many times, they respond back at will, without resolving the main issue. I have been waiting to get my documents back ,on OCT 28 2015 they told me that my documents are ready to be shipped, I am still waiting for them to ship my documents. it appears that,  In the internet age they seem like living in stone age....<//text>

If google had given an option to give negative star, i would have selected that one.
Worst customer service and call center, you won't get connected to the number they provided.  Better India Government should think about these guys...< /text>

<review>Has been a very bitter experience dealing with CKGS. Half the time the website does not work. The application mechanism is buggy. There is a total disconnect between the phone service and the SFO office. When I talked to a friendly local staff when I was tired dealing with the CKGS phone/website, she agreed that their system sucks big time.

Some talk about Digital India and stuff ... but things here sure seem to be still in the 90s if not worse.<//review><rate>1< /rate>< username>

They are completely incompetent and when you try to call, you are routed back to a call center in India, who have no idea about the particular policies of each individual US location. I now have to spend $300 to fly to San Francisco (with my trip to India two days away) to retrieve my husband's lost passport, because they stamped my son's passport with my husband's visa. Meanwhile, my son's application status still shows "pending" and again, we are two days away from the trip. There should be some sort of law against letting this company operate at all, particularly as the sole gateway to getting an Indian visa! Just terrible! Definitely NO STARS, but had to at least put one.<//Review>< Date>

<Text>Terrible phone system, terrible phone service. extremely slow document processing, and almost no transparency in process length. I called and asked to speak with a supervisor to request more information than the support rep was willing to offer me, and he got angry and hung up on me.

They have been holding my passport hostage -- not submitting it for visa approval and not willing to return it back to me unless if ill out a form and wait 4 business days. I may have to cancel my plane tickets because ckgs has been dragging their feet and unable to facilitate my visa application.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>The most frustrating website and customer service!!!
Other than all  the trouble of filling OCI, they rejected my application TWICE.
First time, they rejected my OCI application saying that  spouse's name is not as per my Indian passport. My spouse has middle name 'kumar'  in indian passport but not in US passport.  They could have just asked US passport copies of him, as simple as that. But they rejected whole OCI application.

They also put big lines on all documents/xerox, so you cannot use whole paperwork next time. They spoiled all paperwork.

Next time, I  called them and confirmed on phone several time, should I put middle name? They said yes, I also sent copies of both Indian and us passport of my spouse.  Apart from confirmation from them, they rejected OCI application  SECOND time, saying that spouse's name is not as per US passport.   They LIED on phone. There is no accountability what they say on the phone. They can act differently.

Also they sent back papaer-work thru UPS which is still MISSING. Did not receive my US Passport, and all documents from them, over 4 days now.

<text>If Google would let me, I would give Cox and Kings no stars. This company is the worst to deal with. I have tried to get a visa to do business in India on two separate attempts and these people are incompetent. When you call, you get a call center in India and it takes waiting on hold for an hour to get through. They know nothing. Just try and get a phone number to the office here in San Fransisco! Absolutely unbeleiveable how much time I have wasted on phone calls, and still no visa. I guess they don't want you to do business in India. Way to go Cox and Kings!

<review>This company has some major issues.

First, They really need to have someone come teach them business practices of 2016/2017, because they are so far behind.

From a business prospective, anyone smart enough to make an app and build some relations can build something a hundred times better then there online portal. This company will be wiped out as soon enough, unless they step up.

Second, The customer satisfaction is probably the lowest score I could give this company. Now why am I giving them two stars. Simply for the fact that after figuring out there vigorous process, I got my visa mailed back within a week.

I have heard some personal stories of people who have lost there passports with this companies back and forth and took 10 calls plus 8 from myself to help track down these passports. Than when we called in for the 9th time to assure the last person found the passports, they could no longer locate the passports once again.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<rating>5<//rating><review>CKGS is doing a great job by helping Indian embassy to streamline its services to Indian citizens and NRIs. My recent experience with OCI card application processing using CKGS is pleasant and impressive. I give 5 stars, even though it is not the greatest service available, because they are taking every possible step to improve quality of their services. Remember that Indian consulate general still have age old practices to provide services to its citizens and NRIs, which are yet to be improved. It is not fair to blame consulate without knowing the underlying issues, but quality is not up to expectations. So far CKGS is doing good while supporting consulate processes.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>This service is a Joke!!!. No one has clue even after 6 weeks into my application. Finally, the certificate from consulate has arrived at CKGS facility on 7th June and was in sorting status. When I called CKGS yesterday, they said that after receiving documents from consulate it will take 24 hrs for them to dispatch. Its already 48 hrs and  I just called CKGS, now they say it is minimum of 72 hrs for dispatch. Today is Friday and according to them it will dispatch only after Monday. What a Joke. Wish our Indian government finds a better agency to work with, rather than these nut cases.< /Text>< Pics>

Probably just some opportunistic neighborhood character. Or potentially a scam within their delivery web. Either way, no help given, no recourse offered to make a passport (cost me 600+ USD).. and no refund given on the india visa! I was told, well, we made the visa :D Yes, but then failed to return my passport to my hand. This service has been slack and rude for years. Now they have become a security threat to my identity... and potentially to our country at large.

The government should be ASHAMED to contract out something to such an appalling and shameless company. I can only imagine the biggest bribe was taken to give such incredibly important work to a truly disgusting organization. There can be no other reason or way such a company could win the bid to carry out this work

Honestly, there are no words to describe how appalling they are. Everyone who works at this company should know they are selling their souls to work for what is effectively the devil.

I concur with all the reviews below. And as many reviews have pointed out...the machine that requires you to press 1 every 5-10 seconds in order to stay on the line...that one action alone defines how pathetic and unethical this company are. If the wait is 15 mins (which it ALWAYS is...I'll actually never know cause I NEVER got through), that requires you to press 1 more than 150 TIMES or you get disconnected. If that is not an outright unethical practice...then what is?<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

CKGS application center at San Francisco, US is the worst of all. They have no integrity, work ethics or responsibility.
Also you don't get to talk with them and the only way is their call center at India.

I'm having worst experience with them for an infant visa and have to reschedule my flight because of their laziness and zero responsibility. I initiated the application process in 1st week of October and application center at SF held on to it with no progress.

Every time I called, it been in processing without any progress or action. Beware!! This is the current face of Indian application process.

You should start the process 6 months in advance.< /Review>

<Text>There is a reason the term "red tape" originated in India. CKGS represents bureaucracy at its very worst.  This visa application process has been an unbelievably complicated, expensive and frustrating experience.  My minor daughter's visa application is on hold until I overnight a new original with my notarized signature even though the official form only provides for the applicant's signature: not the parent and there isn't even space, or a jurat, for a notary to sign.  My phone call to the help desk amounted to the agent telling me I was either blind or stupid because the form clearly requires my notarized signature.  I have good vision and I'm a lawyer, paperwork is my jam, and no, neither the form nor the CKGS instructions give any indication that I was required to sign the application.  Prepare yourself for extreme aggravation and extra expense.  Don't even get me going on how backward the application is with regard to a single, female parent of a minor applicant or the whole day the website didn't function and the link to the Indian government site was broken. I am left shaking my head in disbelief that more isn't being done to improve this service, but since CKGS has a state sanctioned monopoly, why bother, I guess.<//Text>< pictures>

They kept my passport & visa application for 4 MONTHS & kept asking for affidavit after affidavit. Then denied my Visa after all the back & forth. I'm a naturalized US citizen & Indian by birth. I need to go to India for medical treatment and after all the begging & pleading these people denied me a Visa. I didn't get my application fee back or any of the paper work that I had submitted, which took me a long time to accumulate. Last time I applied through Travisa and got my approved Visa within 10 days. Cox & Kings took 4 months and still denied it. These people are a very poor example of work ethic and professionalism. I sincerely hope this company get shut down ASAP.< /text>

<text>Clearly one of the worst run companies I've come across.  The only way to get anything done is to go there in person (and you will spend your entire day doing that).  Any attempts for phone calls, emails, faxes, mailing, Fedex will lead to nothing.  They don't respond and any attempt to call their call center for clarifications will either lead to stonewalling or just telling you that they will get back to you (which they wont).  I don't even want the visa any longer... I just want my passport back and even that is a process that requires one to come in person (if they want it don).  I find it shocking that the India Government is even paying a penny for this company.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>Utterly disgusted with their visa processing and customer service alike. A bunch of unprofessional, irresponsible, unethical and incompetent lot. This applies not only to CKGS but CGISF as well. They are all the same. It’s like throwing your passport, application and fees in a black hole and wait for an outcome. Who knows when are you going to get them back, if at all? They actually put more stress on writing disclaimers on their website than actually providing a reliable and a timely service. Unfortunately, most of us are stuck and have to deal with these clowns.< /Review>< Time>

This company is utterly incompetent and Kafka and Turing would understand these robots who are unable to think creatively or "outside their narrow box" Visiting their center is no help. But should you complain not through their own website but on social media, then someone would respond to cut the red tape. Such bad publicity means more than actual smooth business practices. If you need a visa for a single, short visit to India, try e-visas through its government and avoid CKGS if possible.</Review>

<Text>This is the worst service I have ever encountered. I called them to ask some questions and after 20 call tries, finally I was connected and the automated voice said expected wait time is more than 15 mins. The worst part is that every 30 secs, the automated voice will tell you that the expected wait time is more than 15 mins and if you wish to continue then press 1. So, the ordeal started. You need to keep pressing 1 on phone every few secs otherwise the call will get disconnected. This is the first and probably the only service where you need to keep pressing 1 while on hold for long long time. This is crazy and most unfriendly service.<//Text><Response>{'time': 1481021000449, 'text': 'Dear Applicant,\n\nWe request you to share your queries/concerns at cs.usa@ckgs.com to better assist you.\n\nPlease mention the link of this post in your email.\n\nRegards,\nCKGS USA Team'}< /Response></record></dataset><record>

Even when I followed the directions to a T, the website would blank out at the end of the application without any reason at all. You never know why it does that- no reason! Then when I called the ckgs person to help, he went through a list of things, but none of them helped. He asked to start the process all over again (after I had already done it x3) and ofcourse, again the same thing- ugh! The worst! If I could give it 0 starts I would.

I have also dealt with people at the office in person and it's so frustrating. I hope the service and directions improve. Until then, I will have to do the process all over again- again.< /Text><user_id>104692419064599995064<//user_id>< resp>

<Text>Absolutely ridiculous. This is by far one of the worst and most frustrating organizations I have ever had to work with. The website shut me out while I was filling out my application and would not let me log back in or make a new account. The people at the office were amazingly rude and unhelpful. This process ultimately took days and was extremely stressful. CKGS reflects poorly on India.< /Text><user_id>111188547227914591965<//user_id>< resp>

I faced a partical issue with my kid's OCI card due to my US Visa issues
Every time i called, the customer service was prompt & took time to help me out. I should also thanks Erlina for going out of her way to help & sending email updates.

Honestly surprised by the 2 star rating on google reviews, I think it's unfair the US consulate in India with many more restrictions, paper work & security procedures has 4 star rating over CKGS.
I am not saying CKGS & Indian consulate process is optimal,  you still have to diligently follow their checklist, but relative to the US consulates in India, Indian consulate in SF & CKGS are far more easier to get things done.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I had posted the following comment yesterday, and the OCI card has already been dispatched. Thanks for taking these reviews seriously.

[I recently applied for my son's OCI and I'm unable to track the progress. Its been in the same state for many weeks. The status was updated, until I received the passport.
I've posted questions several times, but have not received any response.]<//text>

I received my visa in 12 business days, just in time for my trip!  Though  it was not without worry and spending crazy amounts of time on hold on the phone.  I do believe the "squeaky wheel gets the grease".

Tips:  1)  Make sure your paperwork is in proper order with all the additional documents and properly signed and notarized.  2)  Do call CKGS frequently.  I called them regularly and I think that while they weren't able to provide me much information a log of calls is kept.  3)  If you get anxious about the whereabouts of your passport file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau online.  I filed a complaint on a Friday and by Sunday CKGS had a created the Fed Ex mailing label for my passports, and then it was mailed the next day.

Good luck!</Review>

<Time>1513363175189</Time><rate>1< /rate><text>I would give zero stars to CKGS and the process they have in place for Passport, OCI and OCI -PIO replacement. Indians have habit of paperwork, paperwork and more paperwork. I submitted my son's OCI-PIO card replacement and they send the letter to submit the PIO along with the original proof of payment. Why do you need the proof of payment You wouldn't have asked for PIO if I hadn't paid the fees in the first place? The CKGS website and govt site is riddled with software bugs, data loss, confusing processes. For e.g here is a sample checklist. send 1) Payment Receipt, 2) This letter alongwith submit other documents and 3)PIO. May I ask what other documents you need for #2. Just say, Payment Receipt, This letter and PIO. Thats IT!!!
Completing the OCI process is a marathon effort and the entire process of collecting documents, signatures etc will take minimum 2 weeks . Compare that with applying for US passport. Its Matter of Minutes.

I have submited my sons visa application Sep 17th with all additional requested documents on Sept 23. Last update on the system was Oct 10 saying it was processed.  So far no more update on status and I need my passport back.  Phone is inactive and there is no clear communication on what is going on.  Really poor service.  I love India but hope not to have to suffer with this company again.</Review>

<Text>PIO to OCI conversion should be simple and painless. And that too for a 7 year old kid. Come on. You have already harassed us once. Why again?

In our case, they are asking for mindless documents that is not even mentioned in the required documentation for the PIO to OCI conversion.

And that too they would not tell us all the required documents in one time. I have now sent them more and more documents 3rd time. Every time they demand something new. Spending extra on overnight couriers and notarization.

Where does one begin?

The website - If anyone has been to India and seen advertisements for schools, stores and services, you would notice the banners will be full of useless information - in diarrhea of fugly colors. Every inch of space would be utilized. CKGS website is no exception. Has anyone filled in expiry date of passports? Try scrolling through a date in Dec 2030.

Tried calling their help desk? I go in to a fit of depression, anger, humiliation all at the same time when dialing their help-desk. The same explosive diarrhea of useless information and you are forced to listen to. CKGS got to be make a decision when pronouncing names of US cities. It is weird to catch a desi accent and failed faking of US accent attempt.

None of this would be an issue, if these fools that are employed here did what they are paid to do. That is when all of the above pushes you to existential crisis. Jeez, Why me?

After a wait of 'less than 13 minutes' (that's what the fake accented voice will tell you), You then call in speak to a representative with a fake accent that is neither knowledgeable not capable of addressing a problem. And oh, they show their attitude to cover up their efficiencies and air-headedness. Then you ask for a manager. In my case I was told that the manager was KIND enough to review my request to speak with him/her and that they would call back. ETA - 24 hours!!!!. Jeez, WHY ME???

It is a NIGHTMARE to deal with CKGS and this statement is NOT being made in vein. It is an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE to go through the formalities and deal with these numbskulls.

Going through the difficulties in processing legitimate documents and being stonewalled by these guys, now I am wondering, are they expecting me to bribe them? Will that expedite or just make the process easier? Has anyone bribed CKGS powers-that-be? What is that bribing process? Is that online as well? Please enlighten me.

CKGS stakeholders and employees - If I see CKGS in a resume (current or past experience) that I review, you can be sure that POS resume will end up in recycle bin.< /Text>

0 stars for the website, 0 stars for service. I have applied 5 TIMES in total. Each time, the CKGS site is either down or does not recognize my application, even though I have evidence that my application was submitted via a web reference number and application ID (and even a downloaded PDF of the completed application). As mentioned in other reviews here, there are 2 websites that one must go through to complete the application form and they don't talk to each other well at all (after going to the CKGS website and complete the application there and  am transferred to complete my application on the India government's site, the session will just expire and not return me to the CKGS website (even though the India Government website shows that my application was successfully submitted). I have sent numerous emails to CKGS, called their offices, and went through their contact us/feedback form. I either get no response (they never pick up there phone - the 15 minute wait keeps cycling over and over), or if I do here a response (only via email), there is a ton of back of forth and my questions never get closed out or they tell me to complete the application again! I can understand technology is not perfect, but to have the system constantly not working is ridiculous. At this rate, I may have to adjust my travel plans as I am concerned I may not be able to get a visa.</Review><name>Pat L<//name><resp>{'time': 1467105644742, 'text': 'Dear Applicant, We request you to share your queries/concerns at cs.usa@ckgs.com to better assist you.

<text>I have submited my sons visa application at the end of august. I submitted additional requested documents on Sept 11. Received a confirmation on Sept 13 2014 that documents were received and the application will be processed. Till today that is Oct 16 2014 the application has not been processed and now I track the status and it shows the application is being sent back due to lack of documents. I have called them but the call goes to Mumbai call center. The standard response there is we have escalated the claim to concern department and they will update the status in 72 hours.There is no way to contact them in San Francisco. They dont even respond to emails. If someone from Govt of India is reading or reviewing the reviews please give responsibility to a company who is capable of handling the visa applications and processing them on time. I am already pursuing legal action against this company.</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

are clueless and just give you standard scripted
answers.consulate needs to change the service
and Bring the service back to USA. instead of call
centers in India.
I highly recommend TRAVISA
I would rather pay more & get good service
than pay a little less and get either no or Crappy Service<//Text>

Why there is not an option for zero star??? I just frustrated with CKGS process and the way they deal with their customers. It has been a month since I initially submitted my application for passport renewal.

They put my application on hold saying "Missing Info." I uploaded the document the very next day, paid the fee for print out. Called thrice to confirm if uploaded document is ok and my application is good to go and every time I received different answer. Finally walked in to San Francisco office and there I was told that they rejected my application for no reason. They didn't even check that I uploaded the document. As a next step, I was told by Saurabh & Shrishti (CKGS representative) - I need to resubmit the application and i'll get full refund for my previous application plus shipping charged for my second application.

Since then, through a series of phone calls and emails. I only got half of my application fee back. Not sure what blocking them to issue the full refund when they committed to do so. Still doing follow up with CKGS Assistant Manager Dwayne Wilson. Hoping to get my refund soon. I expect CKGS to respect customer time and stick to their commitments.<//review>

Horrible experience!! This is the worst service center. I applied for renunciation of my Indian citizenship and before starting the application I made sure I thoroughly read and follow the instructions. I even called the service center to make sure all the process requested was followed thru. I used my own Federal express service to send my application to SFO center, as I was told that I can do so either by certified USPS or any type of overnight services.  I generated my own airway bill label and used Federal express standard overnight express envelope to mail my package. My application was received by the service center next day. After six days, I received an email suggesting that I need to I pay additional $18.41 because the package was sent via federal express envelope. See below:

“  Your application received by CKGS Application Center is ‘Not Complete’ and the processing is ‘On Hold’ due to Documentation. Please complete your application by sending the required documents within 7 working days as stated below to the CKGS Application Center.

On receiving the correct document (s) and post verification your Application will be ‘Submitted’ to the Consulate for further processing.
Document Name	Remarks	Status
Other Remarks	ADDITIONAL $18.41 FOR USING FEDEX EXPRESS ENVELOPE. PLEASE PAY ONLINE OR SEND MONEY ORDER OF $18.41	Pending

I was quite surprised to receive such an email, so I decide to call the  contact number provided on CKGS website. For 45 minutes the hold music kept saying that there is 15 minutes wait…after 45 minutes the operate got on call and said all he can do was open a case and I will have to wait for 24-48 hours response as they have no way of contacting them in person or via phone call and all contacts  can be done via emails only.  There is no direct phone service contact with USA location and all calls get routed to India only. So I decided to let them do their job and  wait for their response.  Two days later I got another email and I was told the same thing that I need to pay additional charges.

I called the contact number again, this time I decide to just pay to get things moving and when I logged into my account to pay, there was now where I could pay additional charges as requested.  So again after waiting for 38 minutes and pressing #1 for 60 Plus times (as the instruction keeps saying press “1” if you want to wait or it will disconnect the line) finally I get an operator and the smart  guy tells me, that it’s better for me to pay, as I should follow what I have been told to do so and I should send them a money order check  as there is no option to pay online.

I just can’t believe it, I used my own account to send the application  and wondering why do I  have to pay again? I called very  next day, this time I got an operator by the name “ Vrushal” who totally  understood what was going on and told me that I should not have to pay because there nothing wrong with how the package was sent and there no reason for the additional charges. Even if the package was not sent via envelope the additional charges will be billed to my account not to CKGS, as I did not use their service.  I sent them pictures, proof of billing, address label photos and I am still waiting……. What a horrible service!!!!!  Seems like they have a bunch or morons working in CKGS-SFO, who have no clue of what they are doing.  The website is unfriendly, call  service center hold options are horrible, CKGS staff is untrained. Have no idea how they got their ISO 9001 certificate. Overall very  bad experience  :( Hoping this gets resolved soon.< /text>

I sent in my India tourist visa application and got my passport and visa back in a week.  Not the best but an acceptable experience.
1.	Confusing web page (hence the 3 starts).  The application forms are very complex. I have travelled 2/3 of the world and India’s application is the most complicated I have ever seen. They should just design one form for the people with Pakistan passport or Pakistan origin and give everybody else a break.
2.	Make sure your read and collect all the forms you need.  In my case, I need four forms.  Please not forget to attach a copy of your drive license to proof your address on the application is current.
3.	Since I lived in the Bay Area, I delivered the package myself.  Since CKGS will review your package, one will know if the application is completed or not on the site.  It is easier and quicker to correct the problem that way.
4.	The online appointment system was okay.  My wait at CKGS was about an hour (I watched the “Incredible India” commercial 8 times in the waiting room). When my number was called, a pleasant young lady reviewed my paper works and issued me a receipt within 5 minutes.
5.	Five business days later, the FedEx package showed up at my door step.  The saga was over.
6.	Most of the problem people have with the current system is that they did not fill the forms correctly or did not have all the necessary paper works.  One cannot blame CKGS on that front.<//Review>

<GmapID>0x80858089e112152b:0x3a62c42a75a8ad7f<//GmapID><text>Indians are supposed to be leaders in IT. But try dealing with applying for OCI card when you already have a PIO card and I had to pull my hair out to such an extent that I may end up needing a wig.
They have the website so complicated that the applicant has to keep going back and forth multiple times to upload the initial application and documents. AND the website keeps CRASHING in the middle of the application process. Then they find ridiculous issues with the application and I agree with another post on this website that the "errors" that they find are not errors at all! Not only are their "errors" wrong, but they will keep denying the application one "error" at a time so that you end up paying UPS/FedEx fees multiple times.
Try getting them on the phone, it's almost impossible.
I am so disgusted with this waste of time, that I am tempted not to get my OCI card. With the PM Mr Modi proudly saying "Make in India", maybe fixing the basic internet experience should be a priority.
I will be sending the same email to PMO office too.</text><date>1499704489503< /date>< Name>

<review>Thank you for providing the VERY BEST customer service to us! My friend Ariadna  and I experienced several hiccups while attempting to complete the online visa process, but every time we contacted CKGS, their staff excelled in every aspect of customer service.  From Jayachandran Singh and Shiv at the call center to John at the San Francisco Center, gave us the support, guidance and time to assist us.  Especially John at San Francisco CKGS Center!  When we walked in today, Friday at 2:45PM, we didn't expect any staff to welcome walk ins.  But we were amazed to receive a warm welcome from a young female staff, who asked us the reason for our visit and informed us she is on lunch break but will have another staff assist us. Immediately John greeted us and took us to Window 3 and started the process. We were very anxious whether we could complete the remaining steps in time to get the visa on time for our trip to India next week, Sept 25th!  He not only assisted with reviewing all the documents one by one, but also patiently listened to our stories about our 20+ years friendship and how we mothers are finally excited to take a trip that we promised 15 yrs ago!!! John, we mothers appreciate everything you did for us!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

- The online process of filling out the forms is confusing

- I walk into the office on appointment day and nobody greets you:  you have to figure out on your own whom to talk to

- The appointment time is essentially irrelevant - one has to be pushy with the staff to get one's number called

- The person handling my paperwork refused to let me pick up my passport in person - this is despite assurances over the phone the previous day that I could pick up in person

- My passport was sent to somebody else's address after repeatedly checking my address with the person handling my paperwork

The sad part is that there is no alternative to this ludicrous process - one has to go through this hell if one wants to visit India.< /text>< GmapID>

In the process of applying OCI in lieu of PIO for my minor child.

When applying for this, I followed every inch of the instructions and at some point the application just gave up midway before taking me to the page where I need to go get a temp number before I go to the government site (in india) due to timeout issues. I had to redo everything and then tried everything as needed and sent via the fedex ship. I get an email today saying it is incorrect application and have to resubmit.

Today, I am unable to create a new application since the popup during the new application says unable to proceed since the US Passport is already tied to an existing application.

Tried calling both their numbers for past 1 hour - one does not work and the other immediately asks me to hang up. What a pity and shame. On top of this the email says I have to submit within 7 days or consider the process abandoned!.

I would have loved to give a -ve rating for making this a complex process.</review>

I read all reviews but want to give them benefit of doubt. My application is still in process(1/16/17) and customer service is hard to get but courteous.
Had to apply for a Visa and while doing  renunciation for when I answered no to the question whether I lost it or surrendered to foreign country it said I do not have to apply for renunciation.when I sent my visa application without renunciation they put it and hold and demanded that I do the renunciation.I had to pay another $30 for fedex and another 47 in fees.Even though the renunciation is for misplaced/lost passport there
Iwere many questions about it in the form.The same San francisco consulate had given me 4 Visas(between 1988-2015) before CKGS which I have in my passport.
In all I have paid $155 +77=232 to CKGS, most which is for services by CKGS & fedex.
I hope the matter is handled expeditiously .
1/25/2017 I would like to add the following
I got my Visa today.
In the final analysis the soft ware is the problem.None of the reps can over ride or change anything and therefore are not much helpful.CKGS did its part efficiently enough & kept me informed at all stages.
Renunciation was redundant as the same consulate had already issued me 4 visas after they did not return my Indian Passport during my first visa on my US passport.
Now we travel often and hate to say that while the world is eager to get your tourist dollars Indian Consulates are so callus to grant Tourist Visas.</review>

Their website talks about allowing walk-ins and so do their customer service. The were few of us who were ready to wait for the people with appointments and emergency to complete their visa application and then process ours. And, the SFO website states that they allow walk-in:

Submission without appointment
If an Applicant walks in without an appointment, there will
be a preference given to Emergency Applicants and to
Applicants with prior booked appointments. There will be
a waiting time and the applicants will be serviced on first
come first serve basis. We thank you for your patience
and understanding.

Yet, the folks working there were not OK with the walk-ins and refused despite repetitive pleas from multiple people who were likely desperate. There is a definite disconnect between what is listed on their website and what CKGS SFO follow. They need to understand that people need to travel a great distance to be at the office for the visa application. The policy has to be more accommodative.</text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<text>Not a good experience. The staffs at CKGS are not well trained to handle visa or passport related questions. The entire OCI, passport process is totally confusing and complex.There is no way to contact consulate officials and get clarified. The govt of India has created a barrier by having this third party in between. Applying Indian visa is more of a harassment considering the process and complexity involved.<//text></record>

Worst experience of my life!! You have far better odds of swimming to India directly, then making it through the mess that is the OCI application process. The forms are so unclear, and their "clarifications" will have you wondering for hours what kind of idiot it took to make such a confusing and tedious application. Just a disclaimer, I only needed to have and address changed for my OCI card, and even something as simple as that required ridiculous amounts of repetitive paperwork and forms, so best of luck to the rest of you. Keep in mind though, you have to have all these forms electronically submitted at once, because the application temporary id  in case you want to return to the application serves no purpose at all. If you somehow make it through even all of this mess, the consulate will make sure they take their own sweet time processing your paperwork so do not expect any results anywhere near two months. In conclusion try you very best to never have a problem in regards to your OCI card to avoid this literal hell hole of a process.</Review>

STAY AWAY!!!

Submitted an application for a transit visa.  It was denied because it took C&K 3 weeks to get to it and by then the dates were too close.  Fair enough, things happen, the update on my application tracker said the application would be returned and I would get a refund of fees.  Well that was is September now it is December, and I still don't have my passport!

Edit - Just got my passport back 12/2/14,  just under a 3 month ordeal.< /text>

<text>HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!. When you call them it says" your expected waiting time is 15 mins and if you wish to continue please press 1"  then if you do not press 1 every 5 seconds, the phone call will drop. What kind of inefficient company does indian government give visa contracts to???
The CKGS and Indianvisa website do not integrate properly. I called CKGS for help and that did not fix the problem. I am trying to get a Travel visa to India . I completed the form 4 times but it will not allow me to make the payment online. Horrible website and horrible phone service. Thats why India is going no where.< /text>< pics>

Horrible Visa process ... Not really CKGS fault though. You make one mistake on the application, you cannot correct it; you have to cancel the whole application and start over - a (probably) 1 hour process. This is Indian stupidity in the extreme absurd.</review>

My experience with this company has been a NIGHTMARE. I have applied for OCI and Renunciation for myself and my husband and OCI for my kids. First, they could not "find" our applications (mine and both the kids) and insisted that I had not submitted them. Luckily the Fedex label has the web reference number and hence I had proof that all the applications were delivered.
Next, they rejected the OCI + Renunciation applications as they expected one payment for both applications and not two separate payments. At the time of submission of the OCI application, I NEVER came across the option to pay for the OCI and Renunciation together. I took screenshots and proved to them that their website had issues. They acknowledged the error and fixed their website.
Even though they had a flawed online application process, they still want me to withdraw the applications and re-apply. Why the hell should I do that? They need to accept the applications as the fault was at their end not mine.
Now, for some reason, my OCI application has been processed and sent over to the Embassy!! I am unable to get the status of my Renunciation  application. My husband's OCI application on the other hand is still marked as "On Hold" and I am unable to track his Renunciation application.
They also want me to withdraw my daughter's application as they want proof of parents' renunciation (they do not accept renunciation application/proof of payment and want the surrender certificate). But when I try to file a refund claim it says I can't since the application is being processed!!!
Trying to get the "customer service" guys at the CKGS office to understand all of this is worse than someone pulling your hair out one by one. But since I have spent close to $1700 on all of this, I guess I have no choice but to continue to engage with this incompetent company.< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>In order to complete the visa application, my husband and I (with 3 postgraduate degrees between us) called their call center THREE times since things were so unclear on their website.

This was after submitting an OCI application for our son to the consulate directly, since there is NO indication on the consulate's website (after Googling OCI application) that one must use a 3rd party - by the time we figured that out, it was too late to apply for an OCI card. That is an issue with the consulate, but it still soured this experience.

After several hours of deciphering instructions (incidentally, middle names on passports go along with the first name in the "first name" field of the application), we finally completed all the forms, printed them, took them to the notary, thumbprinted our 17 month old (easier said than done), and brought them to the CKGS San Francisco center.

I was very frustrated with their website because (among other issues) once you select a mode of document delivery (drop off in person vs mail), you cannot change it. And for some reason, although I was initially allowed to make an appointment to drop off the documents, I had to cancel it because I realized I had to work on the day I had selected - then the website refused to allow me to make another appointment! We called the call center yet again about this; they said it was because we had selected "walk in" as our document delivery method...which makes no sense, as I had been able to make an initial appointment.

I mention this because once I arrived at the center, I had to wait in a line just to tell the greeting/desk person what I needed and get a number (she kept getting up and leaving when the people in front of me asked things), then it took nearly THREE hours to be called up, as I did not have an appointment. They tried to specifically call up people with appointments first, but many people just walked up once an agent was open, and were helped. This was quite frustrating.

Their overhead announcement system for calling numbers was broken, and anyone sitting in the 2nd waiting room could not hear numbers being called (I'm glad I got so hungry I had to use their vending machines shortly after arriving, or I might not have figured that part out). When I arrived, they were on non-appointment 610, and my number was 618 - it took over two hours to get through those 8 numbers because they called appointments and people kept going up out of turn.

Once it was finally my turn (around 2:45 PM, after arriving at noon), the experience was fairly pleasant; the agent was polite and helpful, and fortunately all of our documents were in order. We received our son's visa in the mail in less than a week - but we also mistakenly received someone else's passport!!!  His application number was listed to be the same as my son's (which it most definitely was not), so we got his passport. I have called them to find out what to do with the passport, and am awaiting a call back. I hope for his sake that he is not traveling in the next few weeks.

I would have given my overall experience two stars, since the agent was quite polite and helpful, and the visa came very quickly, even though there was a 3 hour wait - but getting someone else's passport in the mail was very frightening - that could just as easily have been my son's passport that was lost!

So, overall - if you can decipher the website, make sure to get your forms notarized/signed/thumbprinted (for kids under 5) appropriately, and have an appointment at the center, you could probably be in and out within an hour or two; otherwise, bring food and something to read, because you will be there for a LONG time. (FYI, their vending machines only take dollar bills).

And at the end of it all, you might not get your passport back, since they could send it to someone else!! If you are sure your documents are in order, it is much better to complete the entire transaction via mail.<//Review>< resp>

<Review>This review is purely for the walk in application process.
I was suuuper nervous sending in my Visa Application via Cox and Kings. I went as a Walk In applicant initially -- which was a BIG mistake. The lines are really long, and a brief look at the Cox and Kings website will make it very clear that it is SUPER EASY to get an appointment for the next day.
**TIP (and I can't reiterate this enough)** : PLEASE MAKE AN APPOINTMENT - Making an appointment is very straightforward, it makes your life really really easy.
I took an appointment for the next day (got the first time slot - 9-10 am). There's a waiting room in the building if you arrive before 9 am, and my heart initially sank when I saw about 20 people waiting, and no sign of anyone from CKGS.
Just when I'd decided that it was going to be a really long wait - a CKGS representative showed up (they open at 9, he was in the room at 8:50), and in an Orderly fashion, started handing out Tokens - Emergencies/ OCI Matchups/ Visas.

I was Number 10 in the Visa line and I'd submitted my documentation/ gotten it verified by 9:30!

Couple of suggestions to make things better
- *It would be great to have an indicator on when the next available open slot for Visa appointment is in the landing page for the consulate*. After talking to people who'd showed up there, I realized it was mostly lack of information that was getting people to do WalkIns (the attitude was - ""I've heard there's no point getting an appointment anyways so I'm going to walk-in"". I had the same opinion, but realized how incorrect that was after seeing that I could easily get a next day appointment).
- It gets really ambiguous if there are a lot of people sitting in the Waiting room without any CKGS representative showing up. Please put up a sign saying *A CKGS representative will be here by 8:55 to hand out Tokens* - this would really help clear the confusion amongst people who show up early.

Tip for people coming in to submit their application via Walkin - please try to get the 9:00 am appointment. It'll be way quicker!<//Review>< pics>

<name>Ravi Jonnal</name><pictures>None</pictures><review>We submitted our Visa applications on 6 Nov, and today is 21 Nov. Over the past two weeks I've been growing more nervous, after CKGS missed various promised benchmarks (notifying us of the receipt of the applications, notifying us of their being sent to the embassy, etc.), and have suffered dozens of increasingly confusing communications. This morning, each of their two phone numbers contained a message saying that the number had been changed to the other one. This is insanity. Joseph Heller could not have dreamed up a more bizarre company.

I'm not even sure whom to report them to because  they don't quite qualify as a 'business'.

Who runs this place, Guy Debord and the Marquis de Sade? Their customer service is an object lesson in dialectics, and their web site is like a Choose Your Own Adventure novel where every ending is me getting punched in the b***s.< /review><resp>None< /resp>< rate>

The only reason why I am giving 1 star is beacuse of the inability to give 0 (If I had an option I would have given them negative stars) They are responsible for handling the visa application to India for visitors and they are not doing any good at it.

Like most of the other people here, I dont have a very good experience in dealing with CKGS. I applied for my 4 month daughter VISA application and the USPS tracking shows that documents were delivered on 7-Oct and an acknowledgement from CKGS on 9-Oct saying that we received your application and is under progress, unfortunately the application is still under process on 16-Nov (even after 38 days). I started following up with CKGS since 25-Oct and uptill now I haven't got an update. The case was escalated on 29th Oct with CKGS and uptill now I don't see where the escalation went. When I call them (yes, after waiting for more than 15 minutes and pressing 1 every 15-20 seconds so that call doesn't not get dis-connected) I don't seem to get an update from the customer care associates on where the visa application is stalled.

I have travel planned for India on 28-Nov to attend a close family wedding for which I have now given up hope as it does not appear that I will receive the visa and passport for my daughter in time. I will be loosing close to $800 in tickets and all other hotel and car reservations that I made in India. When I told the associates at the call center, they argued with me saying that you should not have booked the ticket before getting the visa. According to them I should be asking CKGS before scheduling a marriage.

I still have hopes that I might get the visa in time the chances of which are very few. I will update my review when I actually received my visa<//Review>

Submitted documents after triple checking and after these were delivered via courier got several contradictory emails stating claiming that application fees are not submitted, indian passport is missing.

Luckily, I had sent a cashier's checks and upon checking - CKGS cashed the check 2 days prior to claiming that the application fees were not submitted. The average wait for OCI is well over 75 WORKING DAYS. What are they vetting applicants for? Nobel Prize? What's puzzling is why the Indian Consulate persists with these jokers.<//Text>< user>

<review>Their processing staff appear to not have any knowledge of US citizenship for minors. Notarised documents appear to be ignored. Documents NOT mentioned in checklists are requested after everything that is on the checklist have been submitted already.
No- its not easy to get an appointment- once you start the process of mailing it in. In other words, once you mail it, you can still go there, but expect to be treated as a person without an appointment.
Nobody picks up either of the two phones listed, despite trying for hours.

** Updated **
After attempting several times over a period of 2 hours- i got connected and was put on hold for about 17 minutes. The phone appears to go a centralised processing backoffice of sorts, and not the actual ckgs office. Once i did get through to a rep, he went above and beyond what was expected of him, and gave me clear directions on what else to submit/mail. Changing review to 3 stars, with an implied 5 stars just for that one rep.
** Tips  **
- If your signatures on the applications do not match those on federally issued Ids (US passport) they WILL be returned, and you will then have 7 days to resubmit (no additional payment required). Most of us don't usually sign in perfect style everytime, or even daily, so this can cause some lost time.
- If the applicant is a minor and a US citizen, always submit the parents Naturalization certificate, even if that is not spelled out clearly in the checklist.<//review>< Rate>

The usual Indian govermental incompetence and inefficiency, what else can you expect.

Applied for OCI card for my newborn son, the amount and variety of documents they need is absolutely ridiculous, the charges totally over the top. They seem to forget that this is for a permanent visa for India, not for citizenship in heaven. Getting the paperwork together is a frustrating nightmare, but that's just the start. CGKS employees are lazy and stupid, they demanded a notorised (sic) translation of my birth certificate in English. I had to point out that it was already in English.

Now, after a mere 5 weeks, the application is "under process at the Embassy / Consulate for further scrutinization" FOR AN INFANT. What the hell is there to scrutinize? His criminal record?

Anyone who wants to go to India, just apply for the electronic visa, and do not go for more than one month. Forget OCI, unless you can afford to wait months until they finally can 'match up'.

Of course, IF you want OCI (which you should want as much as a chainsaw up your behind), there is no choice and no alternative.

The Vogons have finally found their match in CGKS!< /Text>

<Text>This is my experience with applying for an Entry Visa for my son who was born here in the US a few months ago. I applied BY POST through CKGS.
Facts: Application+Money Order+all documentation sent by me through USPS, received by CKGS on 5th Nov, 2014 at 11:53AM. CKGS / CGI Holiday: 6th November Notification of Application receipt: 11th Nov Notification of Money Order Processing: 11th Nov Notification of tracking number: 11th Nov Application/Documents submitted to The Indian Consulate: 17th Nov Application/Documents collected from Consulate: 18th Nov Passport sent by courier: 19th Nov Passport received: 21st Nov Overall, I had a pretty good experience. I called the CKGS New York number a few times and was able through to get to the customer rep. You will need to call 5-10 times even when the automated voice mentions high call volume and simply disconnects. The wait times are between 30 mins to an 1hr so patience is key. However, once I did get to speak to a customer rep, they were very knowledgeable, responsive and friendly. It says that the processing time is 3-5 business days on their website but clearly, it takes much longer (16 days in my case). They need to change that in the website or have a flash message or banner saying that they have high application volume and processing time is 2-3 weeks. Other than that, fortunately, my experience was certainly far from being as bad as most people here have written.< /Text><username>Krishna Das<//username><Pictures>None</Pictures>< date>

<Text>I never thought I have to deal with a company like CKGS in US as this was the very reason I left India so I can have a peaceful life but didn't know even after becoming US citizen, I have to deal with Indian consulate to get Indian visa who outsourced it to CKGS. It is hard to understand if CKGS is worst or the Indian consulate.

I applied for Indian visa to CKGS on Oct 27th and their customer service told me to hand deliver the application to San Francisco office to make sure there are no mistakes etc in application which can delay the processing. I did the same for myself and my family. My family got the visa in 2 days but they put a hold on my visa. the reason was that they couldn't find the US entry stamp on my Indian passport (which I submitted along with my renunciation application). They ask for green card when they should know that we have to submit the green card when you become US citizen. However I managed to find a copy of the Green card and submitted by e-mails as requested in the mail and also hand deliver to SF office so they don't have any excuse.

Anyway, I called 4 times since then (with over 45 minutes wait and most calls lasted 1.5 hours or more) with no results. Calls goes to India call center and they have no clue on what goes on in SF office. I also visited CKGS office from LA 3 times in last 3 weeks and met with their manager to know the status of my application. They assure me that they forwarded the documents to Indian consulate which I am not sure. I also emailed 5-6 times to center manager, inquires, Indian consulate etc. and today is Nov 18th, I am schedule to fly on Nov 24th and till today I have no clue if I will get my passport with Indian visa on time before the flight. I am frustrated with their system and hypocrisy of these Indian 3rd party vendors and consulate. I hope I never had to deal with them again.</Text></record>

Wouldn't mind to give zero or even minus stars,one of the worst services ever especially the receptionist and the people in the desk think they are some big shots and the attitude they have when we have any questions for them cannot be appreciated at all.The response they give to us is what we have seen in movies where the masters talk to their slaves,pathetic service.I have been to the ckgs office in nyc,they were excellent but these people have an attitude that they are doing us a favour after all the money we pay to them.</Review>

Absolutely no stars.

My passport application was held back due to missing renunciation application. After submission, both Visa and Renunciation were held back for 8 weeks. To my surprise, Visa got rejected due to missing renunciation and send back via FexEx at  a cost of $30+ from pre-paid fees.

Renunciation submission was Nov 2014 still stuck and no reply. Not sure, how long should I wait.</Review>

<review>I will start referring to this company as Cox & Kegels.
This is the worst service of any agency EVER.
We submitted an OCI application 3 months ago, and never heard back.  I found an email of the OCi team at the consulate, who told us some weeks ago that they had already received the OCI card, and that it's currently at Cox & Kegels.

No phone calls, no emails. Nobody to answer their phones ... WHERE is that $400 OCi card?!<//review>< Pictures>

<text>One word to describe these people, - stupid!
I went in initially and they said I was missing a document just bring that next time and we'll process it.
The next time I go,  they make another excuse.  Why in the blue hell didn't you tell me this in the first time when I visited you people?
Talking to them is complete waste of time smh</text>< date>

<review>Cox and Kings Global Services, San Francisco which is operating and managing OCI process provides is not honest, truthful, and lacks integrity with the OCI tracking.  I sent my passport via Fed Ex for OCI match up and Cox and Kings Global Services, San Francisco offices received it in two days but did not update the tracking that they have received my passport.  Each day I will go to OCI tracker to no avail.  I became nervous and after 12 days when the tracking system was not updated, I sent an e-mail to Cox and Kings Global Services and they confirmed that they have received my passport for OCI matchup.  On the 14th day, they updated the OCI tracking that they have received my passport and it has been in transit to Indian Consulate.  It's been 20 days since Cox and Kings Global Services, San Francisco has received the OCI from India and it's been 17 days that they have received my passport and so far I have not received my OCI.  Cox and Kings, San Francisco is gaming they system by showing that the customers are not sending the passports for OCI matchup.  Cox and Kings, San Francisco is dishonest and lacks intergrity.<//review>< Resp>

This is worst place. No clear communication. I applied for my daughter VISA and told that it will deliver Via febex and after 5 days I found out that I had to pay $15 additional for Fedex. Why they didn't communicate when i was there. Now I am leaving for Indian tomorrow and I have to rush to SFO office to pick up my daughter VISA.  worst service!</Review>

They are such a pain in the ass, their process of getting an indian visa is taking so long and they just keep requesting more and more documents, they just won't process my request. I must've applied for indian visas about two months ago, but still the process goes on, as I keep sending them everything they've requested, they just keep requesting more and more documents and I have no idea when I will get my visas. This is the worst organization I have had to deal with in my life, they are nothing but a joke.< /review>

< review>
The website  and forms are very poorly designed, with  very confusing navigation between the CKGS form and the Govt of India form.  It took me 2 days and multiple calls to the CKGS call center to fill the form. Some of the field labels were incorrect and one help desk person  told me that it is my fault that I don't understand it.. He also told me that it is typical to take 2 days to fill a visa form. The "Appointment" option exists in both the Govt of India site and the CKGS site, but  the former just loops you back to more forms. In the end a technician had to manually link both the forms. Totally frustrated. I still don't have an appointment.< /review>

<review>I just completed filling up the entire renunciation certificate and when I signed up again with the web number, date of birth and us passport number it tells me no record match.
secondly, after becoming us citizen back in the 80s and the passport was not returned (I only have a copy of old passport with picture and passport number page) the system gives you an option of oci+renunciation as a package but throws you out on a loop. Don't know what else to do. really frustrating.<//review><userid>104347921257907629815<//userid></record>

I am surprised that this service is still in existence! The web site mostly does not work, the language is so archaic, navigation buttons break and the phone wait times in order to get clarity is horrendous. How does the Indian Consulate associate themselves with this appalling service provider? It speaks a lot for the Consulate, unfortunately!!<//review>

<Text>Am surprised how they got the contract. Way below par. No email response, nor the call center phone works.

Such a ridiculous process and paper work to get any thing. CKGS blames consulate, and consulate blames CKGS. :)

They forget that they exist for the citizens' services.</Text>< Rate>

The worst, I don’t know that they are problem solver or problems maker, did you really expect a baby of 5 years old to sign on the forms otherwise the application will be on hold for couple weeks?</review>

<Text>The website itself is very confusing and convoluted. I had questions and I needed to call them to clarify. I have been trying for two days and I always get -- We are sorry, due to high call volume we cannot complete your call.

It has been a really painful process to get OCI even after you pay a ridiculous fee of $350. Are you kidding me?</Text>< resp>

Absolutely horrible service, there is no proper system, you can get different answer from every person you talk. I have been submitted documents for multiple family members, one of the document was OK for two file and not for the 3rd file for same question and they sent my file. I would never suggest anyone to work with this organization.</Text>

Terrible service, terrible customer service.  I had an 11am appointment, they made me wait until 5:30pm, when they sent me away and said if I want a visa, to come back in the morning, first come first serve.  They were consistently rude, and incompetent.  I only wish I could give zero stars.< /text>

Horrible customer service - despite having an appointment, had to stand in multiple lines, waited more than one hour to be finally seen - and then was told wrong information on documents needed for our OCI card application; harassed on needing to go back in line with some passport photocopies that they couldn’t get - a complete mess!<//Text>

<text>I had to wait for 2 hours before I was called and this is after I made an online appointment. It's a disgrace. I was given a number and was asked to wait along with walk-ins. Poor customer service and broken process.</text>< username>

<Review>Terrible service. Woman at CKGS told me I couldn't pick up my passport and Visa when it was ready, and that "we only ship passports out". The incompetence didn't just stop with service, she actually wrote the wrong address in and FedEx has been waiting for me to get in touch with them as she obviously would never have given my contact info on the shipment. Avoid them like the plague, if possible< /Review>< Response>
