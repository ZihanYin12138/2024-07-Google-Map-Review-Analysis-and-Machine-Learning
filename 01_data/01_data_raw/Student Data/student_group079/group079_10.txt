<time>1626825074767</time><Review>Dr. Jimenez  was professional & informative as always.  But he zipped out of the room before I thanked him. It was a busy office day, so that's a good thing. Busy means you're in high demand. Well, at least the dental assistant heard my gratitude. Thank You for my tooth chip fix Dr. Jiminez!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Today I went to this place and noticed that:

- The staff of the clinic (both dentists and administration ) were professional.
- The environment of the clinic was clean and tidy.
-The Infection prevention (IP) was a prioritized

Many thanks for the awesome service🙏

<Text>Amazing experience. I was worried because I currently don’t have the best insurance, and I had a filling fall out. I just moved back to SD and have been to two other offices where the service and staff were less then ideal. This office was clean, everyone was welcoming and friendly and Dr. Jimenez was informative and gentle.< /Text>< Pictures>

To Dr. Jimenez and Staff,

After my last visit to Dr. Jimenez's office, Sun Valley Dental in El Cajon, I felt the need to write about my experience because it was so positive and I am extremely happy with the work that was completed. I have an aversion to dentistry work from a bad experience as a child. Dr. Jimenez is the only dentist I will go to. He makes me comfortable, describes exactly what the procedure will be, and then takes the utmost care. The staff is also super helpful and kind making the experience much easier for me. I chipped a tooth, one of my molars, it was something I needed fixed asap. Dr. Jimenez made himself available that day, completed the work and I couldn't be happier. I would highly recommend Dr. Jimenez and his Dental practice for any and all of your needs. I am confident he and his staff will treat you with the same dedicated care they provided me. Thank you Dr. Jimenez and Staff!</Review>

<Review>Dr. Jimenez and his staff are wonderful. I went to see them for a cracked tooth which needed an expensive crown. Having to go to a new dentist after my dentist of 30 years retired was upsetting as I didn’t know much about them only that he was recommended. Wow! I’m so impressed with their professionalism, courtesy and reasonable prices! My crown matches my teeth and fits perfectly. No one tried to up-sell me like other places do. We feel Dr. Jimenez is our family dentist we can trust with all our dental needs for years to come. Thank you Dr. Jimenez and staff!</Review>< user_name>

I’ve been going to Dr Cesar for years now. I know he’s Dr Jimenez, but I call him Cesar. He is a really nice man. Does a great job on my teeth and my children’s teeth and is very honest. It’s refreshing to have an honest dentist after some of the shady ones I have encountered. Neat man! Highly recommend him to everyone.</text>

The absolute best!
I wouldn’t go anywhere else.
Dr. Jimenez is an artist. He bonded some teeth and I love them.
The staff is so friendly and they’re very efficient.
The office is run like a well-oiled machine.< /Text>

His office staff is always wonderful and quite frankly is the best dentist I've been too. I am a huge dental chicken and Dr Jimenez makes sure I'm doing fine the entire time he works on me. His prices are about a third of what a regular dentist would charge, only his work is perfection!

Dr. Jimenez and his staff were very professional. I was in and out and did not feel like I was getting hustled which is key for me. Would Definitely recommend!

<Text>Pleasant office. The dentist and staff really care about you. I was taken to a room and told the dentist would be right in. Five or ten minutes wouldn't have been bad, but I waited 25 minutes after the tech took X-rays. No one popped in with any updates. That's the only reason I didn't give it a five. This office was highly recommended, and I'm looking forward to my follow up visit.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>I started coming here after I saw that 11 people recommended this place on someone’s Facebook post as the best dentist in East County. Dr Jimenez and his staff are amazing and this is the 1st time I’ve had a great dental experience.
They really care about their patients and go above and beyond to insure customer satisfaction.
I now have my children coming here as well as my friend and I will continue to recommend them.
I’d like to add that I also called many other dentists to see how much my procedure would cost since it was extensive and Sun Valley Dental was by far the most affordable as well!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I have been a patient at Dr. Jimenez's office for a little over a year now, and they are great! They wish you happy birthday every year. They send reminder text messages and phone calls for appointments. The dental hygienists are pleasant and gentle with their care. I really like Dr. Jimenez. I have been to some dentist's office where you do not see the dentist during the cleaning, however with Dr. Jimenez he begins the cleaning, and does a routine assessment then allows his hygienist to finish. He makes himself available for questions or concerns before he moves on to his next patient. And he is comprehensive in his explanations of x-rays and dental health. Highly recommend this office.< /Text><user_name>Jonathan Cunha<//user_name><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The best dentist! My husband and I live in Oceanside and we won’t go to anyone else so We will drive the extra miles to come here. They make you feel comfortable and relaxed and Dentist Jimenez is the best and his staff, Blanca in particular very very nice and friendly and very helpful as well. They deserve 10 stars.<//Review>< pics>

I have never had a better dental visit than I did here. The staff was friendly and professional, the doctor is quick while still being though and surprisingly funny. My tooth removal happened so fast and painlessly I was shocked, they took my fears from bad experiences seriously and helped me not panic. If you need a new dentist go here I already set my sis up for an appointment.<//Review>

It's hard to find a good dentist not having the best insurance. The staff was phenomenal. So nice and thorough . Everyone had a smile even though it was law in the day and everyone was probably tired . :) I really Iiked the whole experience . I took my 9 year old here for a cleaning and we will definitely be coming her from now on.< /Text>

I found this Dentist on Denti-Cal and he and his staff were kind and caring, especially the young man doing the x-rays.  Sometimes I have problems with gagging, but he was patient and kind   Dr was professional, but not as gentle as I have had at other places   I will go there once more for filling, but maybe not next cleaning.</text>

I went today and there was a girl doing a work interview who did a great job, but Jimenez came in and asked why i hadn’t gotten braces yet. I simply said that I am planning to but I need to wait till my family can manage that financially. After that he assumed i didn’t have a job and said “why don’t you get a part time job then you can make the monthly payments yourself.” he then asked if i liked my smile and i simply replied by saying not really. and responded to that by saying “your smile is gonna affect you in life. it can mess up things like job interviews or social situations or when your with your friends or even if you like someone” i have no idea why he thought it was acceptable to point out one of my insecurities and say it is going to ruin my life. he had the audacity to say these things and assume things about my life. i will NEVER go back here again and i genuinely suggest that you don’t either.<//review>

<Review>Haven't been to the dentist in a very long time and while I haven't had any bad experiences prior, I've heard just as many nightmarish experiences as the next guy.

Dr. Jimenez and his staff were extremely helpful and VERY friendly. Get in, get an honest evaluation and get out.

I went in with a damaged tooth [due to impact] and he took care of it then and there. I can't praise this place enough. Already looking forward to coming back and WITH the family.

Hope your experience is as good as mine!!!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Friendly, professional, and caring all the way--from the front office to xrays to the exam with Dr. Jimenez. Most important they did not try to upsell me like other dentists have. They told me what I needed without pushing a finance contract at me. Thank you!< /review><gmap_id>0x80d959a7a7bf0db1:0xb83295b3f9f2e46c<//gmap_id>< name>

<Review>Are you looking for the best dentist and dental staff in the San Diego area?
Look no further as Dr Jimenez and all of his staff are it.
I have had dental issues all my life, going to the dentist has always been a bit fearful for me. I am slowly getting over that because of the dentist, Dr J.
It was a 1st earlier today as I did have an appointment, I almost fell asleep while the Dr was cleaning my teeth, my fear IS GOING AWAY!  Thank you Dr Jimenez for who you are.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Decent grocery shop. A good selection of Latino pastries, vegetables, and other food items. It would be nice if the fruits sold are more fresh. Maybe not much demand for fruits? The cashiers are courteous, but not CORVID conscious--was wearing a mask with nose exposed. Make sure to bring cash when shopping here, because a minimum of $5 is required for credit card purchase.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Great local grocery market for fresh fruit, produce, meat, & snacks. Their pastries & baked goods are worth a try-very popular amongst the Latino customers. Most are a bit too sweet for my taste. But i do love their corn muffins & baked mini baguette rolls. Wish they offered some savory items such as meat empanadas.< /Review>< pics>

The best Pan Dulce I have ever had. However, they have changed the recipe on their elote one and the new version does not taste good at all. It was better when the inside was more orangey, the bread was more moist, and they didn't have the black speckled stuff that makes it taste like pan de muerto.
As soon as the original recipe comes back, I am buying the whole batch for my family, it's all we talk about when we go get pan dulce.</text>

I am rating this mostly for the great selection of baked goods on the one side of the market.  They make the biggest (like a ping pong paddle) & best palmiers.  They are buttery but not too crumbly, firm enough to dunk in coffee or milk like a biscotti.  And they have thick fat slices of pound cake, frisbee sized chocolate chip or peanut butter cookies.  And churros.  And much more.  They used to make great burritos to go, but stopped a few years ago, maybe because of the burrito joint next door.

Update 6/5/16:  Came here for the palmiers and shocked that they are now half the size!  Sign of the times.</text>

Imagine if a theme park churro and vanilla custard had a baby. That, my friends, is what I found here -- a beautiful vanilla custard filled churro. For just $1 a piece, you too, can find this little slice of heaven.

In all seriousness, I've been hunting down this particular churro for quite some time now. We kept getting Mexican food catered at work and they would always throw a box of these in with our large orders. I knew it wasn't from the restaurant but I never found out where they were sourcing these bad boys from. Eventually someone at work let me in on the trade secret, which is why I found myself walking into this place at lunch on a workday. Lo and behold, the churros were sitting there in all their glory behind the little acrylic doors. Not quite sure when they make them each day, but if you're lucky enough to get them fresh..well, let's just say you've hit the jackpot.

I didn't get to explore any other part of the store or try any other pastries solely because I came here for one thing and one thing only (lol), but if I were basing it on that alone then this place gets the nod of approval from me. Only downside is that it does have a credit card minimum of $5 but who am I kidding? That just means you can get 5 churros for yourself and not feel bad about it hehe.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The service is very good, the tenants are very friendly people, here you will find typical Mexican products as well as local and organic products; There is no parking only at the front of the business where you can park your car.

(Translated by Google) Good location has the basics in almost everything.
They have very fresh fruits and vegetables and the cakes and breads in the bakery are pretty good and at a good price ... Maybe the way they are shipped is not the correct one, as far as what is hygienic.
They also have Salvadoran tamales! 👍
The girls are very attentive and friendly, in general the place is good

(Original)
Buena ubicacion tiene lo básico en casi todo.
Tienen frutas y verduras muy frescas y los pasteles y panes en la panaderia bastante buenos y a buen precio...  Quiza la forma en que se despachan no sea la correcta,en cuanto a lo higuiénico.
Tambien tienen tamales salvadoreños! 👍

This is a very lovely quaint Store that’s full of beautiful options for all kinds of jewelry needs.

But what was even more lovely what is the customer service that I received having not a clue what to look for I was shown everything under the sun with no apprehension it was just a wonderful buying experience. If you get a chance to be held by Deborah then you’re a lucky person she really went above and beyond and showed me everything that I asked for it was just absolutely pleasant thanks again Debbie you made my day and for sure my girlfriends birthday love the shop glad y’all are still open and Doing so well!
Cheers!</review>

<user>107110288648665965766</user><Review>Received great service, reasonable pricing, quick turn-around, friendly and professional staff.

Purchased upgraded engagement ring from them over a decade ago.  Recently lost a small diamond from the side setting.  They were able to replace the lost diamond and build up the mounting to prevent future issues.  To keep my ring in optimal condition, they are offering free inspection every 6 months to ensure the mounts look good and gems secure.</Review><username>L Wong</username><rating>5</rating>< Date>

<Review>Great selection of engagement rings, timely alterations. But to note, the customer service is the best part of this place. The owner himself educated my then boyfriend and I regarding engagement rings, settings, stones, and helped me find the most PERFECT & unique engagement ring ever! Can't thank them enough for all they did for us.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNj2hByg643RbghY9GWYyNxnivKivV6TD4NsCPX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x8085b6a7d3f1566d:0x54e72f5de1f33e10</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We first went to Hollingsworth Jewelers more than 15 years ago on the advice of a friend. Quickly discovered that these jewelers you can completely trust ... so important when working with a jeweler. Over the years, we bought rings, earrings, necklaces and had many older heirloom pieces repaired or restored.  Highly recommend.</Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>When my family first moved to Petaluma I needed a jeweler.  I asked multiple persons and read multiple reviews before, finally deciding to visit Hollingsworth.  I am so glad I found these wonderful people.  The craftsmanship is second to none. The quality is impeccable.  And, most of all they are kind, generous and honest.   They make you feel right at home with their genuine next door neighbor kindness.  I especially love their dog, too.  I live out of the country now but, when I am home visiting my brother and father I often need something repaired and I always go to this amazing business.  You will not be disappointed.  If I lived anywhere in the Bay Area and I needed a Jeweler...I would drive to Petaluma to visit these genuine people and true professionals.< /Review>< UserId.>

<text>I have bought a number of beautiful pieces here. They are very accommodating and patient and will go the extra mile to assist. They don’t rush you and allow plenty of time for browsing. If they don’t have what you are looking for, the books come out and they will order, at no charge or commitment, what you want. I love it! And they have a great dog there who hangs out!

DO NOT GO HERE, unless you want to be attacked by a barking dog.

I have gone to this store many times and I have recommended them to family and friends. I went recently during the pandemic and they were open and doors unlocked so anyone can walk in, however when I did a large dog came running out and cornered me in the front of the store. The dog was barking and jumping at me. I was literally just looking around, waiting to be helped. The owners just kept saying, "its our son's dog" and "it's only 3 years old." They couldn't even get the dog away because the did not have a collar on it. I am lucky that I am not afraid of dogs, but this was extremely dangerous and unprofessional. They didn't even say sorry until i told them that it was frightening being cornered in the store.</Text>

I took a ring to be sized and to check if the stones were securely in the ring.  They examined the ring and told me the stones were safe and no work needed to be done.  I appreciated their honesty.  I had my ring sized and it was done in a couple of weeks (not bad since it's the holiday season).  They cleaned the ring and sized it perfectly.  Looks great.  I've had other work done there in the past.  Always honest and reliable.< /Review>

<Text>Mike and Tammy are incredibly kind and helpful people. I bought my wife’s engagement ring here as well as her wedding band and my wedding ring. Each time, they were very friendly and seem very knowledgeable and passionate about their jewelry. Their staff is just as friendly as they are, and it’s never bad when theirs a cute yellow Labrador to greet you when you walk in (which they have!). I will definitely be making any jewelry purchases there from now on! You should do the same! Thank you, Hollingsworth!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Having a trustworthy jeweler is worth it’s weight in gold. Hollingsworth has been in the community for many years and they’re the only jeweler I use. I’ve had repairs, appraisals and purchased a gorgeous ring from their estate items.<//review>

<review>My husband worked with Hollingsworth to secretly purchase the most PERFECT engagement ring! We couldn't go anywhere else for the wedding band! He even had my wedding gift set here. The ring set, though chosen separately, go so well together!! The diamond he chose initially is well set - I'm never worried about it. We just had the band and engagement rings welded together. Hollingsworth took care of us every step of the way!! They are absolutely amazing!<//review>< pics>

Incredible service and staff. And wonderful selection. Great attention to detail. I love this place and the people (especially Debi, who has now become a friend) here. This was one of the first experiences for me in Petaluma and surely set an example of how lovely the people are in this beautiful small town. Support local!< /Review>

<Review>I am so impressed with the recent major wedding ring repair.  I’ve been wearing my wedding ring for 32 years, but after it broke a few weeks ago, and I didn’t know if or how it might get repaired. Hollingsworth Jewelers did a fantastic job making the replacement parts which I lost after they broke off. The job they did exceeded my expectations!  Now I will have the repaired shiny, sparkly wedding ring back on my finger just in time for my daughters wedding in May.</Review>< Resp>

<Name>Susan Villa< /Name><Time>1543693525440</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>How do I love Hollingsworth Jewelers? Let me count the ways.
1. The staff and owners are friendly not in smarmy car salesman way.
2. If you are looking for something in particular  they are always willing to bring out the catalogs, bring out the hidden treasures  or offer to have an item made.
3. I appreciate their workmanship on everything from their stocked items to cleaning and repairing jewelry.
4. The staff and owners always have time to explain what can and cannot be done.
5. Local  jewelers who care and you can trust with your family heirlooms.
6. This is one of the best places to find unique estate jewelry  but you may have to ask and have time to look through unpriced treasures.

Shop local. Buy from local folks that care.

This was the greatest experience for our wedding bands. They are voted #1 Jewelers in Petaluma for a reason. Great service, quality products and prompt delivery. We gave them two weeks to come up with a custom wedding band to match an existing engagement ring. They created it in less time. My wife was very pleased with the ring. I would give them 10 stars. Thank you Tammy!</text>

Great people, great service! I recently had some diamond studs converted to dangling small hoops... Mike helped me choose the perfect settings. They look beautiful and were completed quickly.

I have had a wonderful personal experience every time I've gone in. They always have the perfect piece I'm looking for any family member. I bought a necklace for one daughter and went back a year later to buy the same one for my other daughter and Tamara remembered the exact piece and ordered the second one. She is also more than happy to help design unique pieces to suit any price point. I highly recommend!<//Text>

<review>Tammy and Mike run an amazing store in Petaluma!! I have been shopping with them for over 10 years and can't recommend them enough. I started shopping with them when I went to pick out my engagement ring. They provide welcoming, knowledgeable, and professional service. I've since gone back to them to get everything from watches to earrings for both myself and my wife. All the pieces are of phenomenal quality. I've since recommended multiple friends to check them out and all of them walked away with pieces of jewelry that they love!< /review></record>

<text>Their price for a simple soldering a clasp back onto a neck was over priced. I don't beleive a half a roll of silver solder cost that much. They are fairly niece folks, they will make you wait and not address till they are done with their current customer. So okay, three stars maybe a 2 and a half.< /text>< Pictures>

The whole experience of buying an engagement & wedding ring from Debbie was by far the best I’ve had....ever. She’s so good at what she does from high level of job knowledge to her warm family-like approach to customer service, she loves what she does and it shows.</Text>

<Text>Had an engagement ring resized to a smaller setting. From a 9 to 6.5.

It came back oval rather than round, which given the type of ring I understand the need, but where the jeweler connected the cut pieces it wasn’t very uniform. Uneven at the bottom of the shank and the filigree on one side is now a little longer than the other side. It looks haphazardly done.< /Text>< user_id>

There's a good reason Hollingsworth Jewelers Gallery has been in business for a solid 14 years: they know jewelry and they seriously understand the needs of their customers.  They're also very gentle during the potentially anxiety-inducing process of getting married. When I think about it, every time I look at my ring, I'll think of my spouse first...and then Hollingsworth. That's a very long-term endorsement, yes?< /review>

I went to Hollingsworth because I wanted a new setting for my diamond. Before I had just a plain setting. I got a setting  with small diamonds down the side. It looks absolutely stunning and I am so thrilled .  So happy with my choice to use them.< /Text>

Hollingsworth Jewelers did some silver solder work on my Indian Turquoise watchband.  This was a difficult and precise task and their silversmith did an outstanding job.

DO NOT GO HERE! I called to ask the price of an item and the first person said they're not allowed to give prices over the phone. The MANAGER then got on to tell me the price is different for everyone, some customers get better prices than others. THIS IS ILLEGAL!</Text>

<Review>Good store managed by nice people. Got some products I needed from them. I actually didn't know there is a kosher market at that location, but now I know and I am planning on returning. They have many middle eastern products and loser meat. If you are looking for kosher products you should check it out.
Also happened to come here on a very hot day and I was offered a bottle of water on my way out. I liked it.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Owner and his wife are crooks. We went in and ordered chicken breast and hidden in between the the meat they placed a lot of chicken neck. When we called in and complained they called us a liar and they explained how this isn't Iran. HOW RACIST IS THIS PLACE! I've told my whole family to avoid Benny's business. I hope he goes out of business sooner or later! Find another kosher market. This guy is a die hard crook and a racist bastard!</Text>

Stupid face  mask . The bartenders pour honest drinks and the karaoke host's are very friendly and the sound in the place is great, 5 stars for sure!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>This business is promoting an event during a pandemic AND a Statewide order to Shelter in Place!!

When confronted, this was their response:

"We saw your post and message   and want to inform you that we have already been  in contact with the Sherriffs department  regarding our non mandated closure.   1000 palms is an unincorporated part of the county. And hence forth  does not need fall under any   city mandated closures.  However we have taken the necessary  precautions and notices  at the bar for willing patrons who chose  to come to our establishment  to abide by the necessary    safe distance from others  and  are only allowing   a minimum occupancy   inside. We do appreciate and understand your passionate concern  for the health and welfare of our community .  It was a hard decision to make  but we are continuing to support our many employees  and entertainment as long as we can,  within the reguaktions made by Riverside county   if you have any further questions or concern please feel free to reach out  to me . I'd be happy to put you mind at ease"

Karaoke was a bit loud but the divey vibe wasn't too bad. Got a drink quickly and hung out for a game of pool. Not super busy but a fun place nonetheless.</Text>

A big bar with live bands more on alternative side. Dj nights and karaoke...drinks are reasonable. Has a nice gritty feel to it on a strip mall corner in 1000 palms. Can be dead other night jumping...just depends.</text>

Local bar with friendly staff. No food or snacks but you can bring food in. Pool tables and music, sometimes live. Good happy hour prices and best-ever Bloody Marys on Sunday afternoon.</review>

<Review>Thursday night in Downtown Placentia 8:22pm.  Place is a ghost town.  Maybe it's because we're close to closing time at 9pm. Owner/cook is just chillin watching Swamp people on the TV.  Ok. He greets us and says we can sit anywhere we like.

We're greeted by the waitress, our order was taken and we were given some excellent salsa and chips. My wife and I order carne asada fries, 2 birria tacos, 2 tacos de pollo and one quesadilla.

The portions on carne asada fries were huge! But the fries were dry and somewhat rubbery. Don't know if the  fries were cooked long enough. Good flavor though. Quesadilla was a significant size, but lacked flavor. Yes, a quesadilla is just tortilla and cheese but it makes a difference on what type of cheese is used.  The tacos, (birria) had good flavor profile and looked carefully manicured. Portions were a bit on the small side for the price. ($1.65 for the basic tortilla and $2.25 for hand made tortilla). I guess I'm just used to the normal overstuffed tacos with the meat, cilantro and onions hanging over the side of the tortilla.

All in all it's fair. Maybe we need to come at a different time instead of 30-40 min before closing time. Wouldn't go out of my way to make it here, but if I'm in the area I might give it a try again.<//Review>< pictures>

The owner seems to be the order taker, the server, and the cashier. Sometimes they're quick sometimes with your order, sometimes slow. That's why the 4 stars.

Usually pretty empty, with so many competitors around. $1 tacos every Mon-Thurs from 4-8pm can't be beat!<//Text>< pics>

Complementary chips and salsa as soon as I sat down. Carne asada wet burrito has a perfect spice to it. Chicken taco tast very fresh. Very nice people and a clean restaurant.</Text>

There are several Mexican restaurants in Old Town Placentia, including one that seemingly everyone says is the best not just here, but for miles. This however, is our favorite, though admittedly we've many left to try.
Not among the fanciest but it is bright and clean and for flavor, generous portions, and price, not to mention fast friendly service, it's going to take quite a bit to find a better place.
It is my habit, on an initial visit to have my goto combo. Shredded beef enchiladas, rice and beans. The beef was well seasoned and the colorado (it"s a color, not a state 😊) was a deep red and among the best I've had elsewhere. The sided were ample with a generous amount of cheese on the beans. In translation the food lives up to the tasty name. SABROSO, INDEED!< /text>

Lunch: Very surprising place. Full Mexican food menu. The fish tacos I had were very good. Unlike others, fish was lightly breaded and fresh. The Mixed seafood ceviche was very good and plentiful. One of the best I had. Price was very reasonable. I’m definitely coming back and bring friends. Oh, the chips and salsa was good as well. The chips were not thick and over fried. They were crispy and not greasy. Sorry, I forgot to take pictures.< /review>

We had the steak burrito, quesadillas and also split a plate of the supreme nachos. All three items were really good and I especially liked the salsa. Our bill was under $30, which also Includied a huge mug of beer and a bottomless glass of sprite. Service was exactly what you hope for when you go out to eat somewhere.If I'm ever back in this neck of the woods,I'll definitely make a plan to go back there again.</review>< Date>

Super cute place for açaí bowls and smoothies! I got the Berry Greens Protein Smoothie and it was so good! Currently, they are having you order online, so save time and order ahead before picking up!</review>

I have been here before. Before corona, you could go in and order which was amazing. Then in corona, i was able to purchase one smoothly. I’ve come two times. One with cash, and i totally forgot you can’t buy one with cash. My mistake. But today, we brought our credit card, and the website you have to order through declined it. I tried to ask the lady handing the bowls to people what was wrong, and she was sitting on her phone. i had to say excuse me 3 times to get her attention, and she was very uneducated on their website.. their bowls are not worth your time or money.< /Text>

I meet friends in this great restaurant often! This is my favorite spot to pass a nice evening.  I go to this spot at least once a month. The cooking is excellent, the team is welcoming and the payment is fair. I like eating in this place to have a rich supper.</Text>

The acai bowls are straightforward and satisfied the craving, but the value for the quantity and variety of ingredients is not great. Tried the (very) small berry acai $7.99 and protein acai bowls $9.99, all extras incur a surcharge ranging from $0.50-2.00 each. Highly recommend Northside Shack in Point Loma if you're in the area. Not affiliated wìth either.</Text>

Always delicious, but always smaller portions every time I come and more expensive. The bowls are delicious and healthy and made with fresh ingredients. been going here for several years now and never really had a sub par experience but every single time I've come it has been ~5-10% more expensive and the portions are ~5-10% smaller. besides that there's good seating and Its never been too packed to be able to sit in the restaurant.< /Text>

<review>Great space, chill vibe, tasty bowl, reasonable price,  quick service, inspiring quotes on the wall, rad merch displays, cute menu design... they had it all... But I still would not give them 5 stars because my overall experience was NOT exceptional and I think it wouldn't have taken much to get there.

The reasons are probably too subtle or personal for a Google review, and not pointed towards this cafe in particular, but California (&America) in general.

So here we go, here is my FREE guide to all WHITE business owners on being a little more racially inclusive in your thoughts/words/actions. (Please share the kindness with your peers, Sambazon)

1. Be friendly with tourists. Someone coming to your store for the very first time from a different continent is simultaneously experiencing a new culture, new food and new people, so be gentle and patient with their questions.

2. If you cannot recognise an outsider, here's a simple clue, look at their skin colour or listen to their accent. Tip:  It's a great way to start a fun  conversation by trying to guess where they may be from :)

3. Take a little extra effort to smile and make them feel welcome. You may not even be conscious of it but we experience it every day as coloured customers in white establishments. Staff at the counter smile at everyone in the line but when it comes to our turn, it's like they suddenly forget to smile

4. Listen harder and try again if you didn't catch their name the first time because of their strange accent, or the white/christian filters in your brain. Ask them how to spell it and how to pronounce it. They will love you to the moon and back.

5. When their order is ready, call out their funny sounding and awkward name loudly and clearly. If you forgot how to pronounce it or you weren't the one taking the order, take a few steps, walk up to their table and apologize for being stuck in your white bubble and not being comfortable to pronounce their 👽 name. This could be a bloody game changer for you, your customers, your staff and society in general. Next time, please try it.

6. (Optional Bonus Tip) If you didn't do any of the above right, walk up to their table when you have a free moment and ask if they are having a good time. Not in a superficial customer service way but a sincere and caring way. Of course, you could only do this if you had a little extra time between taking and making orders all day, so if you can't do this, it's totally fine.

7. If you are kind and friendly with single female customers but don't give a (insert preferred expletive) about single male customers, that's kinda sexist, so change that.

Good luck with your business! Let's make the world a more friendly place for everyone! ☮️</review>< Pics>

Poor customer service and wait times are not accurately reflected. Standard Acai bowl, nothing I’d report on.<//Review>

This place brings me so much joy and happiness. My absolute favorite ACAI in the world. They do it right. Any other place I have tried can't do it like them - you are getting THE BEST Acai possible here, and the vibes and location are the bomb. I go well out of my way to go here when I am in San Diego area.</text>

Pretty nice place. Interesting layout but not equipped for a large crowd.

There got a bunch of different bowls or you can build your own.

Tried the Bumble Bowl (a special). I'd give it a 7/10. Overall good flavor but the topping ratio wasn't quite right for me. I think it needed more bee pollen and coconut yogurt to balance the granola.

Anyways, I love acai so I'll certainly be back eventually.</text>

<Review>Their Acai is delicious but ridiculously over-priced. The smallest size, basic acai with fruit is 7 bucks, add honey for 50 cents almost 8 bucks, and that's just the small size that doesn't really fill you up. I only go here for convenience<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I LOVE this place, but I'm still only going to give it 4-stars, (you'll see why as you read on further).

PARKING: Depending on when you go, there may be parking close by. The parking lot is pretty small, but I guess it's just enough to accommodate all of the business in that same plaza area.

ACAI BOWLS: The reason why my husband and I stop by when we're in the general vicinity. Their Acai Bowls are so good here. You have to try one here! They come in different combinations. Prices are steep, but they don't skimp on the portion sizes or the quality of the ingredients. Even just getting a Medium-sized bowl is a LOT. I like the Rio Bowl. :)

ATMOSPHERE: Fairly chic, almost has a coffee-house vibe to it. If there were outlets, it would be the perfect spot for me to work with my laptop during the day. But....

LAYOUT: The place is pretty small. Not too many indoor tables to go around. There are tables outside, but they've all been in use the 5 times I've been here. Which is too bad for me... :( I would've loved to just sit and chill, and order something else from there menu if I was there for more than a couple of hours after finishing my bowl.

LOCATION: The beach is close by! I've never tried it yet, but I'm wondering if it's accessible by walking since it looks like it's the next block over.....< /review>

<text>The products are the products--personally more of a pitaya fan over acai, but generally speaking the menu is solid with good options and minimal sneaky suspect ingredients/add-ons.

However, their staff is awful.
Entitled, spoiled, aloof, disengaged…are just some of the experiences that come to mind in my handful of visits.
Asking some of the staff a question, had the experience of a kid asking to sit at the "cool kids table" in the cafeteria. After so many times, I have stopped going because A) as a paying customer and B) as a human being, felt like I should be treated with some more respect and dignity.</text><user_id>102529559066375891673<//user_id><name>Kardiff Kook<//name></record></dataset><record>

<review>Sambazon's first venture into a storefront Café. I actually expected quite a bit from a company I like so much. First off they make great products that are healthy and were generous to a fundraising event at my rock climbing gym in Orange County.

I wanted to go to the Grand Opening, but was too busy, turns out it's been open for a bit and there was the Grand Celebration event. One of the employee's said their dad came in a lot at first to check in on them, but seems to have fallen in love with it and goes whether they are working or not.

It's not a smoothi bar, it's not Jamba Juice, it truly is an Acai Café with tons of room for an expanded menu and such a unique flavor that it should shortly become the Acai capital of San Diego.

For such a large company to not seek the wisdom of a Franchise consultant on how to design, properly train and manage a new store of employees is beyond me. Honestly I could memorize all the ingredients and menu in a matter of minutes and retool the efficiency of the store in a few hours. Business practices that work at a storefront to not translate from sales and marketing.

I went here for a little lunch dessert and decided against the pure dessert bowl and went with Machado's PB & Banana Bowl. The reasoning behind that is if you've ever made your own smoothie from their packs versus the bottles the bottles have apple juice which imo is too fruity and counters the purity of the acai. Plus it's the largest calorie producer in their drinks. This was the bowl and it was dessert, but I wanted chocolate still. Smooth peanut butter, had to have been organic everything else was and it's kinda in their culture here. Crunchy granola, peanut butter, chocolate hemp milk was interesting if you've never had it. It's got much more of a pure chocolate taste than chocolate flavored milk does.

I could have gone crazy making tons of concoctions and like many Coastal shops encourages the customization. If I lived closer and could frequent it more I'd definitely promote my favorite concoction and try to get it on the menu along with the other famous celebs.< /review>< pics>

<review>I use to love this place.  But these new bud tenders have  attitude and  speak very rude. And told That you have cigarettes smell because I just asked him to not put my flowers if he has perfume in his hand.
That's not a good look for Buisness.  I use to love this place when they had bud tenders that give you what you pay for. Bud Tenders have Bad Attitude. And not respect for girls.<//review>< pics>

I use to love this place.  But these new bud tenders have  attitude and  the the grams are off.  They pick and choose if they want to give you the daily special. And the amount of stamps, they stamp your card with. That's not a good look for Buisness.  I use to love this place when they had bud tenders that give you what you pay for. Bud Tenders have Bad Attitude.<//Text>

Security and front staff are friendly...budtenders are not unfriendly but I definitely felt like I was interrupting a lunch break the handful of times I've been there. Probably would look past that if the product was good but frankly the buds have been dry and poor quality (weak and smell nasty). The last two visits, I felt like I wasted my money so I wont be back.</Review>

<Name>Someone Whocares<//Name><time>1550276637506<//time><rating>1<//rating><Review>Non of the weed is actually SC Lab tested, the percentage is nowhere near real! If this spot was legit they would be in compliance and the labels they use are a dead give away that theyre not. If they are legit you can do a simple License search online and find them through: ***Bureau of Cannabis Control***
All legitimate store fronts are listed on the site!!! The rest are black market spots.
Prices are always changing as well as the fake names for the same strains they sold under a different name before. THEY THEMSELVES ARE GETTING HUSTLED FROM THE SHADY GROWERS THEY BUY FROM!
They use cheap scales that are off by .7 almost a whole gram!! The bud tenders are clueless, they say everything is "Fire and gas" Lets you know they pick and choose whats *Top Shelf*
Its all about the money at these spots, not the wellbeing of the real patients!!
Know what your smoking isnt filled with "PGR" and other harmful "Pesticides" that can hurt your health down the line. Dont get hustled, stay safe and smoke clean!!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I used to love this place and come here often until i realize they were stealing from ppl while making it seem like they were hooking it up.  They would give me less but than i was buying. I bought a vap pen from there and they sold me the pin without a charger. When i went back they told me i had to buy one because they werent going to pay for it. Completely rude and unprofessional. No longer a customer. Liars amd thieves. WATCH YOUR BACK!!!!<//review>

I'm not really interested in comics, but they had the most comics I've ever seen in my life. They'll probably have whatever you're looking for.< /text>

He's dedicated to making sure everyone who comes into his store leaves happy. Speros' is truly a unlike any comic store I've been too, and also my favorite.<//Text>< Pics>

This place has many rooms filled with 10's if not 100's of thousands of comics! Many of the rooms are $0.50 a book or fill a short box with as many comics as you can for $50! Their front room has the higher end books, all offered at great prices! If you're looking to fill gaps or find a particular issue, this is a great place to start!</Text>

A wonderful place to be. A friendly place to congregate and make friends. Especially among those who have a passion for comic books. The owner is one of a kind. That is why I call him the Godfather of Comics. He treats you well and gives reasonable deals. You will enjoy your time.< /Text>

<Review>I come here constantly and always find more than I thought I was looking for.  Great place for all sorts of comic readers and super friendly employees that will answer any questions you have (even if you think you're being an annoyance).  Great prices that can't be beat and the owner is one hell of a guy.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Best spot in town for trades, back issues and keys. Their inventory of comics is massive and all a great prices. If you are a collector, new to comic books and not a vendor, than this place is geared for your interests. The environment is safe and reader friendly (since some other places can get intense with debates and excessively anxious profiteers). The staff will also give you a great deal if you do recurring business, so stop on by.</review>

If Heaven had a nickname name it will be Spero's Heroes. An amazing place run by genuine people... comics in good condition, unbeatable prices, hard to find issues, and according to what i saw so far maybe the largest stock on the west coast of America ! If you're a comicbooks fan/reader/collector/beginner then don't go further, this is THE place where you wanna be !
Careful though if you take the time to talk to the crew working there, you might not wanna leave anymore. This place is more than a shop, it got a soul. And it is a beautiful one...</Text>

<Review>On the one hand, I want to give this place 5 stars.  On the other, I don't want anyone else to find this gem and keep it all to myself.  Converted officer in office park, the front room is mostly Golden/bronze/silver age goodies, with stacks of 50 centers in several rooms in back- there's a marvel room, dc, room, etc.  The back rooms are semi organized by character/title but for the most part you are hunting.  I found serval comics in the back that I literally have not been able to find anywhere on the internet at any price, let alone 50 cents.  I think it was 70 bucks to fill a box with whatever you want, saw several people doing that.  Friendly staff and the owner is super reasonable on pricing. I only had 2 hours to spend and it was not nearly enough.<//Review>< pics>

I can't begin to describe how amazing this place is. Thousands of comics all boxed away, ripe for the picking! At 50cents and issue, you can't possibly go wrong. Nothing is in any particular order but for 50 cents weather its a $15 book or a $2 book, why complain? He also has Graphic Novels at 60% cover. Killer deals also on Copper, Bronze, Silve age books etc. If you're a comic book fan, Eliot, the owner, has a home for you at Speros' Heroes!< /Text>

<text>For a real comic lover who loves to spend hours upon hours digging through boxes of old comics. You never know what treasures you will find. And nicer group of people you will be hard pressed to find. The regulars will help you pull books and look for anything you want. They also love to just talk anything ( esp. comics lol). I would recommend this place to any hard core comic fan, but maybe newbie's should look elsewhere to start. Really for the big lovers, although the regulars love to impart their knowledge on anyone who will listen. Elliot's love for the medium is very apparent. Just a great place!< /text><Rate>5<//Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

This place is not the best party supply store for their lack of organization, high prices, and check out practices.

To start off, they got me with the free parking. I should have known that nothing is free. I saw the sign and thought it would be great. As soon as I walked in I saw how disorganized the place was. The line was already taking up an aisle of the store and boxes where open everywhere. The next issue where the prices, when I know for a fact that other stores had similar pinatas for $15 this place had them starting at 20 and 25 for the two I grabbed. With guilt for already parking there I decided to eat the cost. Several candy and items where similarly very high priced, so this is not the place to come get a bargain. Bedies, the employees grabbing pinatas where kind and helpful even through they didn't have a single clue where any character pinata was. There was zero organization and they were constantly being followed by 4 to 5 customers asking where specific pinatas where.

The biggest issue was a result of the cashier. For such a big warehouse with customers packed like rats along the aisles you would think they would have more than one cashier or their fastest person. The opposite, they had a guy who was comically slow if it wasn't for the 40 minute line wait I had to endure. This was like a SNL sketch, he would scan items and when he didn't know he would ask the owner "Kennia" and then repeat the price to the customer who obviously heard her. They really need to get someone that can check the customers out quickly and efficiently so the store can clear out. Last but most importantly they imposed a made up fee on my cc for using a certain card. They said they were being charged that by the credit card, and they were passing the charge onto me. As a merchant that is the cost of doing business, you don't punish me for paying with legal tender in credit card form.

If you are looking for party supplies at a reasonable price, avoid this tourist trap. The free parking comes out more expensive with their unreasonably high prices and credit card fees.</Review>

If your having a difficult time finding items for the theme of your event they'll do whatever is possible on their end to help you get or create what you need for your event; such as centerpieces and pinatas. I had a week to get what I needed and they got it done for me within that time frame!! And their pricings are very fair .<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Very helpful staff, great parking in a very busy downtown LA area. Many choices of supplies to choose from and great prices. They even told me buy two more of an item to get wholesale price and save $50 on getting 12 items instead of the 10. I'll difinitly come by shopping here for my Event Planning Business.<//Review>

Kennia has a great variety of character items.  We recently purchased about $300 worth of Mario Brothers decorations with prices comparable to Amazon. On top of that Kennia gave us another discount. Thank you Kennia!</review>

Cups, plates, forks, balloons, paper products even candy and chocolate can all be found in these themes and various sizes. Very friendly staff. Helped me out trying to locate LOL doll material for my daughters party. Must see place. Save time and ask at front for specific theme to get pointed in right direction.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

The candy here is a bit more expensive, but they have a collection that has stuff I've never seen anywhere else before. It's the only place that I know that sells grapefruit gummies and grapefruit infused caramel chocolate bars in the City!</Review></record>

(Translated by Google) In the photos it looks very beautiful but if you are under the buildings it is very dirty, because there are many stalls, garbage, and there is dirty water on the sidewalk and in the street. Well I don't like it but everyone has different opinions.

(Original)
En las fotos se mira muy bonito pero si estás abajo de los edificios está muy sucio, porque ay mucho puestos, basura, y ay agua sucia en la banqueta y en la calle. Bueno yo no me gusta pero cada quien tiene diferentes opiniones.</review>

<text>The meals here have never failed to be anything but delicious!! Their homemade soups really hit the spot. I LOVE their Chicken Fried Steak and eggs. Of course, their biscuits and gravy are like mom's. They are quick to satisfy requests. But it's their knockout desserts that make me the happiest of campers. Almost forgot, they have a great TacoTuesday menu too!!<//text></record>

Cozy little dinner. Breakfast is a specialty and available all day. The food was served quickly. The chicken fried steak is so huge and delicious too. They have a varied selection of 3 egg omelets to choose from or they will create one to include your favorite items. Fresh baked biscuits pair well with gravy. The biscuits are smaller than others, but they offer them in servings of two, four or more. Our waiter was delightful and attended all our needs. I like the automated system they use. The waiter enters your order on a tablet and if you pay with a credit card, it never leaves your sight since the waiter can swipe your card with his tablet at your table.< /Review>

<review>After a year of closing of restaurants, we decide to venture to this place.

They are open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.  They serve breakfast and lunch.

My honey had their Ortega Chill Cheese burger.   The burger was big, juicey and fresh.

I had the pastrami melt.  It was good.

The price is very reasonable with large portions.  I would recommend this place.

We plan to try their breakfast next time.< /review><resp>None< /resp><time>1617316644189< /time>< rate>

First time trying it, big portions  and all delicious. I had the waffle combo with extra fruit on top and ham. It was not disappointing, my sis had a skillet with sausage and she said it was good too. Be prepared to wait a little for the staff, can't go here if you're in a rush. Will definitely be coming back< /Review>

<Review>I have been coming to Flo’s Airport Cafe #2, Riverside Avenue location, for many years.   My favorite breakfast is Donna’s Duet.   The portions are generous on all the food they serve.   I love Taco Tuesday....Flo’s serves 3 fully stuffed tacos with rice and beans and a side of sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo.   Delicious.   Flo’s also makes their own homemade soup of the day.   I have tried all the daily soups and was never disappointed.   They make a delicious Asian Chicken Salad that is yummy and another favorite for me.   I haven’t tried the Fried Chicken plate yet, but other customer friends I have talked with raved about the fried chicken.   The sandwiches are good too.  I am a tea drinker.   Depending on the weather, I will either order hot tea with honey and a lemon wedge or iced tea with a lemon wedge.   Of course, you get refills on the tea or coffee.   Flo’s has a large menu selection, and specials are posted daily.   I also enjoy their outdoor dining area.   Occasionally, I take my old trained and certified Service Dog/Therapy Dog.   He likes the outdoor dining area and fresh air.   He quietly lays near my feet.   Some customers don’t notice him until we are leaving.   Then they all comment how well-behaved and quiet he was.  They also comment on his beauty.< /Review>< name>

I've been eating here since 1972. By far the best biscuits and gravy in the world. Humble Little Country Cafe with outstanding food. The home made pies and ice cream are to die for. totally recommend to everyone. ❤👍<//Review>

Flo’s has been good but recently the quality of food is not the same. Service has not been good , waitresses get bothered when asking for additional items.  The waitress that usually waits on us is usually friendly and real attentive on Thursday’s but not today. The other waitress brought the food to us cold and we asked if she can warm the soup and got bothered and still brought it cold

We like going there because we like giving the business to our city but that’s it, no more after 15 years of going there. Very disappointed, it’s too bad that personnel has to bring the business down</Text>

Service was great! Had breakfast and ordered biscuits and gravy to go. My Denver omelet was soso. Have had better. Sort of a ham mush inside and no bell pepper. I will try something else next time I go. Maybe it was an off day, if the same I won't be back. Too bad, used to be so good. Heard airport is better.< /Review>

<review>Breakfast plate to expensive for small portions, food was cold, potatoes dry, and older woman waitress made a remark when we asked for hot sauce, pepper, jelly these are usually on table. As I waited to hand her my debit card, this waitress strolled by and grabbed it out of my hand! Will go back another time and try something different.<//review>< rating>

Even better that they're just 10 minutes walking distance from me!

<Review>Wow! With trying to help current business stay alive during this COVID outbreak. Just had a unpleasant experience. Called to place a ToGo order about 1/2 hour before their closing time of 2:00. When I was asked to hold the lady who answered said to the person at the counter that she was taking a order from “ I don’t know why people call to make a order so close to closing time” after listening to her take that persons order she came into the phone and I asked if they were backed up with orders. She said no I can take your order but we close at 2:00. So I proceed to give her my order which was fried chicken, which of course bought out a reaction from her saying it takes a really long time to make that. So I did not place my order. Apparently Flo’s has so much business that is not a concern for them.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c33322f8fab223:0xbc482eaeb55844b9<//Gmap_id></record>

We took a friend with us on our last visit. Cathy had the chicken fried steak dinner. I had the special of the day BBQ Pork Ribs. Mike ordered the breakfast special with biscuits and gravy. No complaints about the food. The service was quick and friendly. It looks like they have a large amount of return customers since they are greeted by name.

Love the 50's style Diner. Very cozy and reminds me of the small town I grew up in.

We will definitely put Flo's on our monthly list and a place to take friends and family.</text>< pics>

<text>The first time was delicious.  Made me want to definitely come back.  2nd time,it's like the chef forgot to put salt in everything.  I had to dump salt on the gravy.  I thought it was just me until I noticed the table next to me pouring salt on their gravy and food.  My wife and I forced ourself to eat but couldn't.  Maybe they just had a off-day.  Unfortunately I won't be back to test again.  Such a shame because we loved the food first time around.<//text>< Gmap_id>

Great family breakfast joint, authentic, great portions. My only tiny gripe was the service, she was rushed I get it but a few seconds to smile and say hello is not hard. My eggs were barely cooked even after I specifically requested over medium.<//Review>

Pretty greasy spoon. Seems to be a local fav, just nothing special. Was invited here for a business meeting. Just hard to give more stars if there is nothing to come back for. Maybe I'm missing the charm?</review>

I visit California at least four times a year. The first place I ask my husband about is Flo's cafe. I am a bread lover and the biscuits and gravy is GREAT. They do it better that Tony the Tiger. Everything on the menu is Good. Tricia is the best waiter in the place. Hope I got her name right?<//review>

<text>Flo's is a real diner. The waitresses are amazing. The food is fresh and real comfort food.  They have prime rib on the weekends. I have gluten intolerance and though they don't have a gluten free menu there are always things I can read there without problems. If they aren't sure they will ask. So far I haven't found a food they don't make there, so they know what's in everything. Tho I don't eat their pies, I've heard the are awesome. They always have specials that aren't on the menu. So worth going. A real local gem!<//text>< Resp>

<review>Ok look, I'm a senior citizen, IF you are going to offer biscuits n gravy, I dont expect it to taste as good as moms at home but this gravy was so pedestrian boring, y'all need to spice it up a little with pepper WHILE making it, AND NO its NOT the same if just add pepper after its cooked and ready to eat.

Yea yea a restaurant has to feed everyone including no spice people, fine so take a clue from restaurants elsewhere, make 2 different kinds of gravy</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I’m new to area so my husband and I decided to go eat breakfast near by and land to this spot we get there and we didn’t know if we needed to wait to be seated or just walk in. We were told to wait, when waited we seen they had more than enough tables for a party of two so what was the wait? Close to 15 minutes later a Caucasian couple comes in and got seated within seconds. So if you’re brown you’ll most likely have to wait! We left and took our money else where.</Review>

<text>Flo's has always been a family favorite.  I've been coming here for as long as I can remember.  My most favorite location is the one by the Chino Airport. French yosdt and biscuits and gravy are the best! Shirley at Flo's #2 is the greatest waitress ever! Her smiles and joy bring an all around happy, home feeling.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c33322f8fab223:0xbc482eaeb55844b9<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Classic diner food. Have been to flos #2 family restaurant three times now, have gotten the barbeque burger, the mile high potroast sandwich, and the rueben. Out of the three, the rueben ranks the best, the others were bland and lacked serious flavor. The sauerkraut gave some much needed flavor. The saving grace of this restaurant is the desert/ pie section. I have never been dissapointed. The peach cobbler and the peanut butter chocolate pie are very good. Overall okay. Would take as a top pick.< /text>

Best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. Great country fried steak, too! Pretty much everything they have was made in store; the biscuits, the gravy - even the sausage in the gravy. Great prices for how much food you get. Service is always fast and friendly.<//Review>

Not only was a seated fast, but my coffee was there in a snap, my order was promptly taken, and the ticket time was less than ten minutes. Solo meal and got out in under 15 bucks...

I Haven't been to Flo's #2 since the late 80's. Took my family back to the scene of the crime (if you will). Chino was home born and raised. We eat breakfast at Flo's today and it brought back so many memories. Flo's has not changed in all these years, still larg tasty portions. If you're in Chino stop by Flo's for a tasty meal.</Review>

It's the best breakfast in California.    I come here every time I'm in southern California.    The most for the least.  The manager is great n so is the rest of the staff.  Tell Mary hello for me n God speed her recovery.

<review>I will drive over an hour just to enjoy their amazing breakfasts!
Been going there since the 80's.
We bring our out of country guests from Spain and Mexico to Flo's! They go back home CRAVING for another chance to come back.
Unbeatable service and food.<//review>< Pics>

Good, traditional breakfast place! Famous for their biscuits and gravy. Nothing super special with the food compared to other diners. Have great pies though!</text>

Flo's is your local Diner it has American food everything is served fairly large you could share it with your family and friends. Because the food is so good the locals here flock hearing group it's always very crowded on the weekends but the longest we've ever had to wait was 15 minutes.<//Text>

Amazing service and amazing food! My dad and I at least come here once a week! I do have to admit that there are times where the food is alright or the customer service is average, but those times are few and far and hasn't affected our views about the place!</text>

Pretty good food at a decent price more likely to fill you up for what you get. Second time I've been here, only gone for breakfast. The service is ok, asked for napkins but the server forgot, no big deal. If you get a half order of biscuits and gravy consider sharing it, because its pretty big.</Review>

Was not pleased at all. There was a long wait. Took 30 minutes just for waitress to even take our order, the party next to us got seated after us and still got there food before us. Food wasn't all that great, hash browns were burnt. I recommend you go to the Flos #1 by the air port, much better service.</Review>

I ordered a steak and eggs here and when they brought me back my meal I noticed my steak was spotty. I thought maybe the seasonings had just burnt on there. Turned out the steak they had given me was rotten! I told the waitress and she seemed to not even care she just asked if I wanted anything else and I said no thank you. How are you going to cook and serve a rotten steak without noticing that his gotten old? Surely old meat has a smell and look right? I will not return to this disgusting place again.<//review>

I ordered a steak and eggs here and when they brought me back my meal I noticed my steak was spotty. I thought maybe the seasonings had just burnt on there. Turned out the steak they had given me was rotten! I told the waitress and she seemed to not even care she just asked if I wanted anything else and I said no thank you. How are you going to cook and serve a rotten steak without noticing that his gotten old? Surely old meat has a smell and look right? I will not return to this disgusting place again.</text>

Had the Monte Cristo sandwich and it was really good. Most people come here for the biscuits and gravy. This time I took a seat at the bar and saw a lot of different dishes coming out of the kitchen. A few dishes that looked really good were the chicken fried steak, pancakes and a T-bone. All looked really good but not too many places serve a Monte Cristo sandwich which is why I got it and was not disapointed. It came with fries. I also saw many pies that looked awesome but I was too full from the sandwich to try any.<//Review>

<review>This placed is tucked away so it feels great discovering it. There's this inviting family vibe to go with homestyle food thats good alone or in groups. Loved how friendly the staff is.
Try the chicken sandwhich (fried or grilled), the pineapple pancakes or the biscuits and gravy. Also have great burgers/steaks & even a few vegetarian options.</review><Date>1500765802479< /Date><response>None<//response>< Name>
