Before posting the bad review I had tried to file a complaint w/ the Western Dental Call Center. After 2 transfers & 15 minutes or so, more time explaining constructive criticism, I was told that their complaint department can only take reports from actual clients. I was transferred back to Customer Service - where I had started because they are allowed to take complaints from me - an almost client. By this time I had invested 25 - 30 minutes trying to let Western Dental know of problems costing them business. I was beyond frustrated, decided Western Dental deserved no more of my time & hung up. You, a possible new client is worth a final warning. Do you really want a Dentist with such rude, unprofessional staff & an inability to reach the office directly unless you are willing to waste 15-30 minutes going through the Call Center? My 1 star review stands.

The local # above takes you to a Call Center. I wanted to know which Dentists at this office were "In Network Providers" w/ my insurance. The Call Center had no idea & said I needed to speak directly w/ the office. Which is why I had called the local #. To get to this point I wasted at least 15 minutes. The Call Center Operator & I waited on hold for another 15 minutes or so before reaching someone at the dental office. I was transferred to a VERY rude, impatient, haute woman who was annoyed by my requests for her to do her job. She wanted to know if my insurance was a HMO or PPO. I explained that it was a PPO, that I know that Western Dental is In Network but I ONLY want to see an In Network Dentist. She was flagrantly condescending in tone & words trying to explain that it doesn't matter - I can see anyone there. Nope. That would open the door for price gouging or a bait & switch. (I'll post the general warning put out by my insurance company.) She was so amazingly unprofessional I hung up. Wish I had noted her name to give her the credit for lost business. This is actually the 2nd Western Dental I've decided to never give my business. The Western Dental office at 2140 E Palmdale Blvd never answered the 6 - 8 calls made today by Western Dental Call Center Operators. I'm going to find another company.</Review>< Rate>

<Date>1621347072924<//Date><rate>1<//rate><Text>I give this office ONE star because they are open on Saturdays and take emergency walk-ins.  However, the service I received was unacceptable on many levels.  I had an abscess tooth and loose crown and needed to see a dentist ASAP; I couldn't wait until Monday to see my regular dentist.  Once I got there and filled out a mountain of paperwork, they couldn't "verify" my primary or secondary insurance (both Delta Dental), so the receptionist said "sorry, but we will keep your paperwork and when we verify your insurance, we will call you back to reschedule."  She didn't even ask if I was willing to.pay cash/credit and get reimbursed by my insurance.  I left without getting my dental emergency even looked at... horrible!!< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Honestly, highly disappointed. I scheduled an appointment because this office specifically is In-Network for my insurance. I arrive the day of the appointment early and there is a giant line due to no one being there to sign you in or direct you in anyway. Finally someone came back and I filled out the required paperwork for her to then take my ID and have me wait about 35 minutes outside due to covid in 90 degree whether for her to tell me that the location number I had was wrong when I had gotten it directly from my insurance along with the address. Come to find out after contacting my insurance that everything I had was fine. Seems like they were just lazy instead of trying to resolve the issue it was “come back in a week after you contact your insurance”.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>The Western dental team in Palmdale on Rancho Vista Blvd is AMAZING. They were so helpful and caring and did everything to make me comfortable in every way. I felt no pain whatsoever. I highly recommend them and will forever remain a patient at this office. If you need any work done, go to the Palmdale office on Rancho Vista Blvd. 5 stars all the way.</text></record></dataset><record>

Hopefully the rest of the dentist aren’t so rude, I just live near by and would of preferred to stay close by home. Customer service counseling is needed for this location.

If I can give a 0 stars I will. These people are so UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE! THIS IS SO UNACCEPTABLE !!! Knowing I have an emergency problems makes it worst. Their FRONT DESK IS SO RUDE AND SHOULD BE OUT OF THAT JOB . Im not speaking just for myself. I saw her being SO RUDE TO THIS OLD WOMEN, I felt so bad.

If they knew that insurance was down they should have called their patients and informed them so they wont have to go to the dentist and have their time WASTED!

This is unbelievable . I cannot stress this enough if you wanna stress like I did , then go at your own risk .< /review>

Dr. Patel is awesome and honest. I don't like going to the dentist due to past experience. Dr. Patel made me feel comfortable and secure in the advice for treatment. He was my second opinion from another dentist that I was unsure about. Sure enough that dentist gave me the wrong information about my treatment he was gonna damage my good teeth I have left to make money. I didn't need a root canal. Dr Patel said all i needed was a filling and I could keep my teeth. I like Dr Patel already. He's a good dentist. Thank you Dr Patel. Patty was a sweet heart to with her valuable information. Thank you Patty for making me feel like a valued customer. You both get 5 star's from me. Oh yeah. The antibiotic has my tooth feeling better that other dentist didn't even offer me pain relief. Thanks again to Dr Patel😊❤< /text>

I’ve always had fear of dentists due to my previous dentist but I decided to switch to Western Dental and they are very nice, kind and helped me with any questions and concerns I had. Dr. Conway did my fillings and she was very nice and entertaining made me forget I was in a dentist chair so I really appreciate her attitude. Steve was very nice also and he was making conversation with me which I liked because it wasn’t awkward and I was very comfortable. I’m very glad I chose Western Dental as my dentist office.< /review>

I have seen 3 dentist here, the first 2 were above my expectations, they were kind caring and did not make me feel judged,they took the time to answer my questions and I never felt rushed.
Very refreshing, and made me feel secure about using western dental to do a massive overhaul on my mouth.
When I actually went to have all of my back teeth pulled, it was a dentist that I have not seen before. My experience with him was absolutely unpleasant . He constantly yelled at me for not opening my mouth enough, which  I was having difficulty doing with a mouth full of novocaine.  When I made a noise because  he was hurting me , he told me "you don't need to be so loud " ....it was a involuntary response to pain. There were a few other things, basically I felt he completely lacked any compassion. I need to go back and I will definitely make sure that he  never has access to my mouth again!</Review>

Waited an hour in the waiting room for my appointment (due to a mistake on WD’s behalf) waited another hour to be treated once in the dental chair. Doctors bought in the wrong file, and almost proceeded to perform a procedure I didn’t need (based on another patient’s file). Once I got there, despite having full coverage insurance they tried pitching a credit card on me in order to me to receive basic pain management during my oral surgery. Once I turned down the credit card, they no longer wanted to do the procedure agreed upon. I also witnessed employees making fun of a disabled woman for not being able to properly use the x- ray machine due to her disability!! The dentists were extremely rude, lacked compassion, extremely unprofessional and unorganized!!! Please Avoid this location!! Smile Dental on K in Lancaster is a slightly better alternative....thank me later!!!<//Review>

< Review>
I gave the orthodontics department a 1 because I did t have the option to select a -0. They are always messing up the appointments. They schedule at a date and time and then make you wait for ever and have other people go ahead of you , then tell you your appointment was not for that day when you have the appointment card to show them otherwise. Aside from that receptionists is rude and very unprofessional. They need to work on their people skills. Act accordingly if we are paying customers. After all it's not like we are paying a couple hundred $. We are spending thousands of dollars on braces. 1st and last time I will ever use western dental for any service.</Review>

The MOST unethical and unprofessional office. Twice had treatments done and both times they tried to over charge. Quoted me at 1100 and when an explanation was requested, it dropped to 600 then to 500 and finally 400. Insisted I remove 4 wisdom teeth when my insurance easily covered two and in THREE weeks the rest could have been covered. Waited for HOURS to receive an explanation for charges. Do not go!<//Text>

Doesn't matter if you have an appointment..I'm a new patient and came in early for paperwork and they didnt give it to me till 20 min after I signed in..I asked why they waited when it's already past my appointment time and they said its busy..I reminded them I came early for this reason and the girl at reception had nothing to say..its now 20 min past my appointment...
They finally call me in and I was complaining about the wait and the girl straight told me that whenever you make an appointment they WILL NEVER SEE YOU AT THAT TIME...its a joke< /Text>

I drove here with my two children an hour and a half from  Tehachapi because it was covered by my insurance-  we were in the waiting room for two hours waiting for our cleanings and were then told we would possibly be cleaned in another half hour or hour !!!   the x-ray guy was extremely rude and was creepy towards my 17-year-old daughter . I own a business and I have to be on time  for my clients which were expecting me today so..... we had to leave and drive an hour and a half back after receiving NOTHING!!!!!  horrific service.  The woman asked me if I was going to reschedule I told her we will not be coming back !</text>

< review>
Wooooah, AVOID. This place is easily a scam for people that pay in cash. I had 3 cavaties as well as needing a root canal + crown and was in need of a deep cleaning. They quoted me $6500 to do all the work and tried to pressure me into doing it with care credit without even thinking about it. Luckily I walked out and went to 10 west dental across the street and ended paying $2800 for the same work... On top of that, we waited over an hour for our appointment here when everywhere else is no wait. This place is only good if you have Medi-Cal. Otherwise they will 100% try to take full advantage of you. Save money and get better work by shopping around. Also, their "free exam and xray for new patients" that they advertise is a bold faced line. Had to pay 131 even though I walked out and was a 1st time patient. Update: I called customer service about my issue and was directed to a Patty at this office who proceeded to call me a liar. When she began to become irate I requested to begin recording the call, she said no and that she will get her manager and proceeded to hang up on me. This may be one of the worst customer experiences in my life.<//review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>The orthodontist here did a pretty good job. I have not had any experience with the regular dentist but overall the orthodontist seemed to know what he was doing and my teeth came out looking great! I was a bit hesitant at first because he requested for  four of my teeth to be pulled out!! I did not like this at all, but in the end the gaps closed and my teeth look really nice. i would recommend this orthodontist, the only thing is that it took longer than any of my other friends to fix their teeth :/< /Review>< pics>

Terrible customer service and very guilty of medical malpractice! I've had small issues with this office in the past but the last problem I had was when I sat on a chair to find out and get poked by a random needle(syringe) left behind form a totally different patient! I was told from another office I needed to go back to this office to continue my treatment and made an appointment just because I have as still in so much tooth pain to find out they transferred me to another office leaving me in pain until my new office gets the approval from my insurance to continue treatment! Do not come here they are horrible people that care more about profits then their patients.< /text>

< Review>
At the Palmdale WDC I met PCC Mercedes who was friendly and made me feel comfortable. Unlike Palmdale Gateway Dental, where the Dentist asked have you been biting on cement. The Dentist and his assistant broke out in a roar of laughter. After I completed my work their I changed offices. I'm very satisfied with the professionalism at Western Dental.< /Review>

This place is terrible. The place is dirty. The employees are not friendly. The appointment system is horrible. Twice I was at this office has an appointment made two weeks in advance and when I got to the office, they couldn't find me. I don't know how they can stay on business.<//review>

<text>Worst place. Waiting time with appt is 1 15 min,rude and mean staff, my husband had an appointment and when he arrived they told him they couldn't see him because the specialist was not in they should of call him and let him know about that and change his appointment and this happened twice. Careless staff including managers Lupita and Jeneth because they knew the situation and whenever he called them they were not supposedly available and they would never return his phone call to get the fray read and when it was going to get read.

< Review>
Disaster!!! Stay away!!! The first visit we waited 90 minutes for our appointment. Thinking this was just a one-time issue- we come back for a routine cleaning and after waiting 40 minutes I ask how much longer and I am told another 45 minutes at least!!! If you have an appt for 4:15 it does not mean an hour and a half later!  Or if you are having an issue, let me know when I check my child in. I have the professional courtesy to arrive early and you just let us wait like cattle even though I have paid hundreds of dollars to you. I am a reasonable professional and expect respectful and timely treatment. I left work early, made arrangements for my other children to be on time.As a single working mother, that is challenging...this place is a disgrace and im sorry i chose you and gave you my hard earned dollars.

Update: my exhusband took my son back a week later for a 9am apt-he took out son out of school- drove there because thats where our dental insuance is- since i went at 4 a week earlier and they were behind he thought getting a 9am would mean no delays--- he was wrong- after waiting 15 minutes he was told the dentist wouldnt be in until 10 or later---my exhusband and I are divorced because we couldnt agree- but we bith agree this place is terrible- who wait hours to be seen? THIS IS THE THIRD TIME!!And when youre the early app???.  run dont walk from this over crowded- poorly run- pathetic excuse for a dentist office!</Review>

Terrible way to try to schedule a dental appointment. After being transferred to another department, the automated system said I would be on hold for 2 minutes. I waited over an hour and 30 minutes without anyone picking up the line.my phone was running out of juice from being on speaker mode for so long.< /Review>

<rate>1<//rate><UserId.>109006963136875602130<//UserId.><review>1st, I was a patient at office in Redlands cal. my 1st visit was ok, but when I went in for another visit, doctor said I needed deep cleaning and he did it right then. ever since that cleaning, my teeth have been super sensitive to hot and cold. I did not have that problem until after that "deep cleaning". I will never go back to that office or any other western dental offices. I am not happy at all and I will never recommend western dental to anyone. I wish I could have gotten my money back from Redlands. to have to pay for a dentist to hurt you and to make all teeth and gums hurt constanatly now, that is a huge problem for me. I will never go back ever again. in fact, please take my name and my email off your contact info.

thanks for nothing,

< review>
G and m was contracted to tow my truck today. The driver that showed up was probably the best tow truck driver I’ve ever had, and I’m a mechanic of 20 years, I know plenty of them.
He called before he arrived, he arrived early. Took great care of my truck. Plus he was friendly and actively cared about what was wrong with my truck. This man has a heart for people and one helluva driver.
You folks have a good man on your hands with this driver. I hope y’all take care of him. Thank you again for the great service and have a good day.< /review>

Tim from G and M was kind and patient when he came out to unlock our car. We scheduled our service through AAA. The response time was very good and the services that were provided were excellent. Thanks again to G and M towing and their 5 star employee Tim.</text>

< Review>
I am so grateful to G&M Towing & Recovery in Hesperia, CA! My son was volunteering about 20 miles from G&M Towing. He went to get large tanks of water refilled for the camp and the weight of it apparently made the car he was driving dig into the sandy shoulder dirt road and he was stuck in a hole. We couldn't find any other company to either answer their phone (and a few advertised 24 hour) or really want to rescue him with a winch without knowing his exact location which was difficult as the road turned into a dirt road to a camp. 2 other volunteers left the car and one got lost in the heat of the day!! My son stayed with the car along with another lady who had health issues that would be exacerbated. I thought I had found someone to get the car back on the road when I called Visa Roadside Dispatch but after waiting for hours and never getting the text I was told I would get and calling back several times.. ...they were not able to find a tow truck either. I then called G&M and thank God a human answered immediately, Alyssa, she was so helpful and genuine. She took charge calling my son for details to access what was the best plan. The towing man with the winch finally pulled the car out of the hole at 2am!! They had been stranded all day in the heat! What a blessing to be reassured by Alyssa as I am across country on the East Coast. Thanks so very much!< /Review>

<Review>Fast and friendly service. Tim was Great  treated my car like his own.
I was stuck on the 15 north cajon pass. Do you know how dangerous it is to be at side of the 15 freeway. Called AAA. The tow company they called was supposed to be there in 30 minutes  I waited 1 1/2 hour(roy & dots) before calling AAA back and requested other tow company which I was very very Happy.  That's  when Tim from G & M towing come to the rescue.    Great customer service Tim...👍<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c3677f5a08447f:0x8177f938f1a9704a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1601569677891, 'text': 'Claims KOF\nThis was a heavy duty truck on its side. It spilled its fuel and oil. Haz Mat is required to clean it up so it doesn’t enter storm drains. We have been in business since 1967. We haven’t accomplished this by being scammers as you say. We are instructed by CHP to clean the scene and recover the truck & trailer. Your underlying frustration with is caused because the trucking company you hired took the turn to fast which caused the accident. G&M Towing has nothing to do with your product not being delivered on time. That responsibility falls on the trucking company. We are however responsible for our companies employees and their families. We provided a service per CHP request which we expect to be paid for,so we can pay our workers. Remember our professional staff recovered your product. We saved your load. It is in excellent condition.

Never have I experienced such horrible service. The initial quote and timeline was acceptable so I decided to proceed with the repair. Once the initial timeline came I called and they still had not started the repair. Once the repair commenced the initial quote almost tripled. I kindly asked to put the vehicle back together and would pay them for the time spent. After several days and phone calls later I finally got my vehicle back.

I ended up going to a secondary mechanic who completed the repair within the agreed timeline and price. I would never, ever give this place business.

I went on a recommendation from a friend. While in the lobby waiting for my turn, I noticed the staff was extremely friendly towards the two customers ahead of me. I was very impressed with the way they treated the customers. Once it was my turn the employees persona changed for the worse. I don’t know if it was because of my race or because I was not a familiar face.

Stay away people.</text>

Very Expensive and They used the moment of the weakness to make more money, Promised they will do the job and when we waited for 5 hours for them they said they need a second truck even I explained what needs to be done, and charged me double, and as that is not enough, to move the load in the trailer to 6 inch they charged 500 dollars extra. They were here for 2 hours and charged me 2100 dollars!! They new I had no choice after the first payment of 800 and they played me! No Humanity left in this people!!!!< /review>

We have had our 70 Chevelle, along with our 68 Camaro, and a motor home towed in the past. We were extremely pleased with the we were treated throughout the entire process. We have had both Mondo and Tim tow the Chevelle to various locations,  and we were  pleasantly surprised with how careful the were with them. G & M Towing is a great company who we are happy to have done business with.

Thank you!< /Review>

I suggest you steer clear of this company. They maintain unethical and illegal relationships with local body/collision repair shops in an attempt to collect additional funds. Mando is an untrustworthy driver with ulterior motives, in the event that you have a collision DO NOT allow them to store or deliver your vehicle anywhere than a safe place. With a very unprofessional staff and management this tow company will attempt to bleed you of any available funds that they can get. Mando- my tow driver collected additional "commission" from their unethical business relationship with a local collision Center.< /Text>

< Review>
We were on our way home to Utah from California when my moms car broke down at a random gas station right off the freeway. We were traveling with 4 adults and 5 children ranging in age from 10 months to 7 years. We had no clue where we were or who to tow the vehicle to. We submitted an insurance claim for roadside assistance who then sent G&M towing. The estimated time was right around 90 minutes. We felt a little panicked because we were pretty much stranded in an unknown area with kids. When the dispatcher called to confirm our pickup location they heard the kids in the background and learned we were out of state travelers they had their driver out to us within 15 minutes. The staff was extremely friendly and got to my moms car instantly. I highly recommend G&M towing and automotive to anyone needing a tow or auto work. I am beyond grateful for their kindness and compassion for our situation.< /Review>

I call g&m towing and told them that's one of the trucks drop a bunch of rocks on my car and the dispatcher said that she would tell the driver let rocks are coming off she did not ask me if she can pay for my window since I said a rock hit my window so I give two thumbs down to a company that don't take care of  other people's property< /review>

I could give this place a negative score it would be -1000 my car got towed it was there 2 days and it was $590 from the start and veryday it was there it was 75 per day after 7 days they will put a lean on it and charge 600 extra on top of what you owe but wait if you try to get your vehicle after 5 or on the weekend they charge you 200 gate fee for someone to come and open the gate what kind of bs is that so i ended up paying almost 1000 for 6 days my car was there<//Text>

< Review>
Very disappointed customer. My car was towed in by this company after my accident.  Once it was transferred to the body shop, magically no remote to my keyless car. When I called to ask if they had it, Sam was very rude and brushed me off by saying no we don't have it and no idea where it's at. All of a sudden his supervisor was not in the office when I asked to speak to him. And all Sam could say to me is I dont know.....very helpful Sam!!!! Thanks guys for losing my remote and then brushing me off as if its nothing!!! G&M towing is a horrible company!!!! DON'T DEAL WITH THE RUN!!!</Review>

G & M had them back on the road in very short time for what I would consider a very reasonable repair charge.  The staff was very professional yet friendly and everyone is extremely satisfied!  We would highly recommend them.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
My family has been going to G&M for automotive repairs for a very long time. We always  get great service and never have any problems. If we ever have a problem with work they have done they are right on it to get it fixed and always honor their warranties! I always recommend this place to anyone I know and so does my father.< /Review>

<Review>Bad customer service. I had a simple question to ask and they kept me on hold for over 20 minutes. I had to go there myself  get info on my vehicle. When I got there I was still on hold and I could see staff just chatting away not doing much.Guy in back office is unprofessional and rude. Pretends to be very busy. What a joke. Seemed like they were stalling to release my vehicle for some reason. In the end all was squared away. Of course not with out losing half of day's work but also walking away with a nice bill of over 1,100.</Review>< Pictures>

G&M always takes care of me.  The work performed is dealership quality without the hassle, done right the first time! Family owned for decades, they stand behind their work.<//review>

< review>
I took my 95 Silverado here a while back for a basic tune up it took them 2 hours and a very high price and the truck ran fine for a week or so then I heard a tapping noise when the truck ran like a loud lifter. I checked the plugs 3 out of 8 were loose. This was about 6 years ago and every since then I've learned to do this type of work myself. .. if you're going to charge a ton for your work that's fine but at least match it with the workmanship. .</review>

If I could give less than one star,  I definitely  would. I broke down on the way home from work tonight, I was on Ranchero, about 3 miles from home.  I called G&M since they were the closest.  The gal who answered the phone put me on hold a couple of times,  then told me they were short of drivers,  being this is a 24 hour company,  I asked what would be a good time to call back, she said, sorry, I have a driver going home at 8, so we will be even shorter, sorry we can't help you. What a way to run a business!
My next call was Serrato's, they provided professional, courteous service in a timely manner.< /text>

They started making their business towing away cars from parking lots and traffic accidents. They're like vultures waiting to swoop down and grab what-ever they can and they're greedy about it. There's no dealing with them unless you have lots of cash to satisfy their hunger. I know from personal experience. I have over 30 yr.s as a working certified -honest -professional Automotive Tech.<//review>< Name>

Horrible Service. Charged Me 700 for a new computer and that wasn't even the problem. I drove 30 miles north and the same original problem, stalled out, occurred again. Stranded and told that my truck is old and that is why it isn't working, I brought it in to be fixed, if they couldn't fix it they should have told me that. Not charge me an outrageous fee, 400 labor 300 part, and leave me stranded with the same problem. Terrible.< /review>

3 Stars for being the only tow company I could reach that could winch me out of a bad situation on short notice. Only downside was the $250 an hour with a 2 hour minimum required paid over the phone for something that was local and took mere minutes to do. I even had to hook up their winch to my tow hook. Lesson learned, install winch for that kinda money to pull myself out next time.</text>

On a trip to Michigan had a day from hell, my gmc towing a fifth wheel broke down on the pass, called AAA and they sent a tow truck from G&M towing which in turn they brought me here. I can honestly say EVERYONE was great and super curteous. They sure got on it and found the solution and didn't rip me off like some other places would have (sorry  pepboys) keep up the good work!!!</Review>

<Review>Let's face it g & m .You work with the CHP and local police.You charge more for service  because our aka police crime fighters want there half.feeding on the citizens with organized crime.example : Today I almost died on the canon pass.Felt all the wheels lose traction.Than that rear end slowly drift out.Like a pilot testing the flaps and switches I spun like a top.finally bumped into the rain gutter and rested.I could have drove it out if the mud.anyways Does everyone agree that not everyone has 250 bucks sitting in the bank at all times.taking away cars for over charging.If know this for years so take it from me.This is why crime happens.can't get to work now because my cars gone.<//Review>< UserId.>

These guys are fast. You need a quick fix they are the answer. Professional, courteous and the final price was the same as the quoted price. They'll see me again.<//Text>

<text>My brake light went out and they let me drop in, fixed the issue with 30-minutes (even though they were busy), and the price was excellent. I watched them provide the same customer service and quality of care to every person who came in while I was waiting. This is now my go-to repair shop.</text>< Pictures>

I’ve been with this place for 20+ years and they always made me happy.  This crew are the best,
Respectful, professional, and they let you know what really needs to be done, no BS. They’re there to help and let you know what’s really wrong and they don’t make up things:
I highly recommend this place,  no regrets there.

This place is run by ethical people, who use business ethical standards that all of us can trust When QT&B gives a customer a quote, it is reasoned and trustworthy. While they do not hold your vehicle forever, they are liberal in holding it during the time the custoner needs to decide what to do with a offered solution and a quote for the work. Shop the issue with other like businesses and then when you discover that theirs is the most competative, just let them have the job. They also guarantee their work, so take that to your bankbook like I have now many times.</Text></record>

< Review>
I have been going here almost 10 years... but felt compelled to write after the great job Sean did on my CRV this time.  Another place had looked at it, and used the words "give up on it" because it had a vacuum leak. (Turns out it had multiple small issues, some because my husband tried to fix it first).  Sean gave me a reasonable time frame (I had to leave it with him - he's busy and I understand first come, first serve), and had it back to me as promised, for a fair price.  I didn't have to buy a new-to-me car (yippee) and I know I can bring it back to him to keep it running in tip-top shape.  I highly recommend him.<//Review>

I been going there for 10 years now. All the mechanics are very professional and the prices are way too reasonable.  The owner has a good team and he runs quite a tight ship. All the best to these guys. Will continue use them.</Review>

<review>I came here to get my breaks and light checked and I also needed to get it smogged. The battery in the  car I purchased  was just replaced so I guess I had to drive it for a certain amount of miles steady with mph traffic being horrible I kept thinking/hoping the whatever reset but traffic being drop and go it was nearly impossible. I kept prematurely coming back saying to smog it being that annoying customer. And I don't know if he was the owner or manager I don't even know his name. But she was super nice. Great smile. No matter how many times I came in to early he was always super nice and willing to help me on spot. 5 months later someone crashes into my car. And he the owner/manager was able to find and print me out a copy of my receipt so I could use it for reimbursement purpose. He his deffinelty professional and 100% helpful. Will be my go to mechanic in Hayward.< /review>< Pictures>

Affordable rates and honest work, been with this shop over 12 years. You may have to wait or drop it off for a while but the repairs will be done and there will be no extra charges tacked on.</Review>

<rate>2<//rate><text>Absolutely NOT recommended for business. My parents went to this place to smog their car. When they checked the car out they said it wouldn't pass smog. They fixed the car and said my parents had to drive 50 miles and then come back and the car should pass smog. Well after 3 weeks, 5 visits (mine being the last), 500 miles put on the car, 3 full tanks of gas (at least), a complete waste of mine and my parents time and they told us we couldn't use the air conditioner for the couple weeks. I told my mother to go somewhere else for a second opinion. She went somewhere else, absolutely nothing was wrong with the car, in fact they laughed at Quick Tune and Brake, the car has passed smog and is registered in less then an hour (Thank you, AMC on Mission). Quick Tune and Brake is a complete joke, Too bad I couldn't give 0 stars.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A BLOWN HEAD GASKET AND MY SPARK PLUGS WAS RUSTED AND MY OIL IS MIXING WITH MY WATER WICH IS CAUSING MY CAR TO OVERHEAT , (RED FLAG ) MY CAR WAS NOT OVERHEATED OR WAS IT EVER OVERHEATING, THEY WANT 1100$ ON TOP OF 95$ FOR THEM TO RUN THE TEST FOR THEM TO TELL ME THE PROBLEM , 1100 $ THERES NO WAY I COULD OF AFFORDED THAT AT THE TIME SO I TURN DOWN THE SERVICES . TOOK MY CAR TO A FRIEND OF A FRIEND AND HE TOLD ME IT WAS MY  IGNITIONS COILS , HE RAN THE SAME TEST AND TOLD ME A DIFFRENT THING . ALSO AUTO ZONE ON MISSION WAS VERY HELPFUL AND THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NO WAY IT WAS A BLOWN GASKET , THEY SIMPLY EXPLAINED THE DIFFRENTS & THE DIFFRENT SIGHS AND  SYMPTOMS  , I HAD NONE OF THEM ! All this shop wants is money ! they dont care about the costomers ! My grandfather goes here and still always has problems with his cars , he spends thousands of dollars here .

I came because of my brakes having grinding noise, front left rotor scorring (severe scratch on rotor ) and my pedal is vibrating. Paul didn't try to upsell nor overcharged me. They inspected my brakes and removed a small debri between the pads and rotors for $10. Unlike other autoshops, they will tell you bunch of problems and end up paying a lot.. i really recommend this autoshop!!! Great job!!!< /text>

<Review>1st time there, Great service with Veronica and a great fast cut. Got a skin fade, hard part and for $15! Most barbers charge double that and no pressure to tip which was great. I have her business card and I intend to tip mightily as this great cut has aged well.<//Review>< pics>

The gal who cut my hair was wonderful! She took her time and even asked if I wanted to keep a lock of my hair, since I cut off over 18".  She's very patient and knowledgeable. A great place to go if you want to be pampered. 😊💕<//Text>

Maria cut my long thick hair to shoulder length with layers. She is gentle and skilled. The best haircut I've had since moving  to the US from Canada a year ago. Cost $17 before tip. No wait time walked in and out within 20mins. Will return.</review>

Other places that I have gone to when I ask for a trim they do more than that and doesn't look like the same cut that I had before. but this place is very fast and they just trim it so I still have the same hairstyle.

I have had great experiences with this salon.. Q has been cutting and styling my hair for almost 8 years and also some of my friends..  I have tried other places in the past but still keep coming here.. Yes, its hard to understand some of the employees but overall, its been a great place to go.. Thank you Best Cuts!!<//Text>

<text>Definitely the worst cut I've ever had. I was hesitant but was assured by stylist that they did a good job. My boyfriend asked for a simple short fade, the guy there messed it up & the fade lines were so crooked that we had to try to fix when we got home! The lady who cut my hair didn't listen to what I wanted. I wanted a taper with short sides & a trim on top, I left with a poor excuse for a faux hawk instead! Extremely disappointed. I would not recommend this place to anyone! I had pics to show what  i wanted but that lady insisted she knew after I described it. Worse cut in my life !<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

First of all you cant understand a word they're saying to you...they don't listen to what you have to say! This guy really messed up on my son's haircut. I wanted a 2 on the side for him and the guy actually did a 0!! i was furious at that point. They, still charged me $10 for the cut. When I argued with them that this is not what I had asked for, then they started to argue with me and said that "this is what you wanted and this is what you got"!! So, over all this is not a place to go to for your haircut! These people are horrible and mean! Only go there if you want to waste your money!< /Review>< pictures>

It didn't take so long like other barbers did and I'm glad with the hair I got
They also give you a lot of information and they ensure that your hair looks great< /text>

Pepperoni pizza 7.65 there is not 5 dollar pepperoni.
Very nice person at the front . Pizza is not that tasty , I think is good to try something different.  I like to support local businesses, I think little Caesar , Pizza Hut and other have plenty of costumer ..<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I ordered pizza at 5:10pm on Sunday October 25th, and it was an unsatisfactory experience. The "young" girl who took the order had said there was certain toppings out, which was  disappointing, then she said it would be ready in 25 minutes. My son got there at 5:30, and was told it would be 10 minutes more, which ended being 30 minutes more! Then when he got the pizzas home, it was 2 medium and 1 large, which I ordered 2 LARGE 4 topping pizzas, and 1 LARGE cheese pizza. I called the store, and asked for a manager and she said there wasn't one. She asked what the problem was, and I told her I received 2 medium pizzas, and 1 large instead of 3 large pizzas. She made up some story saying the large pizzas only have 8 slices, and we got the correct pizzas. She said the pizza with 10 slices is an XL which we got as a mistake. How is it that a large pizza is only 8 slices? Not only were the sizes wrong, but the pizzas were not even warm, and didn't have the fresh quality that I'm used too from your shop. This order was definitely not worth $30.95. It was very unsatisfactory, and this is not the first time this has happened within the last few months. Please look into this, because as of right now, I think I'll wait on ordering more pizza from this store.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<user_name>Chris Cole<//user_name><text>Where to start... order was completely wrong. The girl seemed stoned or something. I ordered cheese bread, mozzarella sticks, sausage and olive pizza and a tomato basil pizza. I recieved a sausage and onion , a tomato only pizza and pizza crust with light cheese melted on it. Dry and toasted like a cheese pizza with no sauce. Disgusting... The best part is this girl who took my order and made my food waits till after I pay to tell me "oh and by the way we didnt have any basil for your pizza sorry". Will never come back and dont reccomend anyone go here if this girl is working here. What a joke...< /text>< Pics>

Ordered the Giant pizza pie, gotta tell you all, it didn't disappoint at all, I mean it was perfect, plenty of fresh juicy ingredients and cooked to perfection. The Giant pie was enough for 7 people and then some. Will tell my friends about this place.<//review>

<review>At first I was a bit sceptical about ordering from here based on someone else's negative reviews. But I like giving every spot an opportunity and support small businesses. Definitely glad I made the right decision. Enjoy!< /review>< Pictures>

2.5 stars at the most.
Reviews looked good enough to try, but all 4 of us were disappointed. Not a very good flavor, crust was very dry, not a lot of sauce, and a lot of grease. Maybe one or two pepperoni on each slice.
BBQ wings were not very flavorful either. Their large pizza is about the size of a medium at other locations we eat at. May try it again to see if they just had a bad day.</text>

Super friendly and laid back staff. Pizza never has undercooked crust like a lot of places out here. For the $5 large carryout special, this is a way better deal than the place named after the Roman dictator.< /Review>

Best pizza around! Gezzinis is family owned and is quality for a cheap price. We've recently stopped ordering anywhere else! Their sausage is the most flavorful you can get from a pizza place.</text>

Terrible service.  Called in an order and when I showed up they did not have my order.  Then they told me to wait about 10 minutes and I ended up waiting 45 minutes.  Never going back again.< /Text>

<review>They put out a nice pie, plenty of options pertaining to toppings. But only one style crust, we were looking for a thin crust pizza. The staff was nice, and we only waited a short while. We prefer thin crust pizza as we try to cut down on carbs wherever we can, if that's you, skip this place.< /review>< pics>

::PLEASE READ:: Discrimination at its finest? I'm writing this review that I should've wrote about 2-3 months ago but anyways.. I had came here several times. Called the place one time and said if the manager was in so i can speak to him about a job opportunity. Cashier is super cool right. Says "He's in around noon". No problem. The next day or so, I walk in looking for him, not in. Next few days or so, I walk in and I was looking for a "tall guy with a mustache" as the cashier described when I called. I walk in and see this man come from around back coming to help me. Heres the conversation. "Pickup?" , me "Hi is the manager in today?", "M--May I ask why?" he says with a sour face looking at me closely. me "I was hoping to talk to him about a job opportunity?". This guy says "oh no he's not" he says with some accent looking me up and down. me "oh okay thank you sir". I walked in respectfully from the beginning. Walked out thinking "huh he looked just like the description, thats weird".

Heres the INTERESTING PART.. I think about 2 weeks later I walk in again because I really need a job. The cool cashier I saw my 1st time in there was there, I asked "Hi is he in today", "He isss but he Just left", "ohh ok do you know when he'll be back?" as i looked out the window.. as the cashier is replying to me I look out the window for a quick glance, its the tall guy, and as i see him the cashier is saying "Um im not sur-- Oh there he is now!" ... He's referring to the tall guy.. I'm lost at words.. as Mr. "Manager" walks in he opens the door and enters slowly as he sees were looking at him. "Hi can i heelp youu? he says. Dude. are you fricken kidding me now all of a sudden He's the Manager? what a shame. Me beginning to be fired up I stood in silence looking at him then left as i said "ill come back later" no. I wont be back EVER. I will let my family know of the discrimination. Forget you gezzinys pizza, great workers.. LOWLIFE MANAGER.< /Text>

My first and last time ordering there the pizza was disgusting. The large salad was a joke it was very small enough for only one person the hot wings tasted like it was old meat and re-cooked< /text>

I come here all the time and I've never had anything but delicious home made New York style pizza every time, at an incredible price. I was born and raised in NYC and recently moved out to Palmdale, Gezziny's was almost like a Godsend because when you grow up in New York, you know the difference between the small business home made pizzas with quality ingredients and corporate franchise crap like Little Casear's or Domino's. Caesar's literally taste like vomit half the time. I wish nothing but continued success for Gezziny's, thank you guys just for being around and so close to my house! Haha<//Review>

Not the same pizza, the taste is different. It seems like it's missing something.</Review>

Ordered 4 pizzas, the crust was doughy and undercooked.  They messed up on the toppings as well.  Called back the owner didn't want to do anything to correct the issue. Never ordering from them again!<//Text>

Great pizza! Each pizza turns out a little different every time, which keeps things interesting. The Buffalo wings and jalapeño poppers are to die for!<//Text>

<Text>We have ordered from Goodfellas many times but this last time the pizza crusts were burned, the pizza slices looked like they were cut by someone on drugs and our fried artichokes were way overdone. Not a satisfactory take out experience for the $$.< /Text>< userid>

<review>Fantastic little pizza place hidden in Pacifica. I had the eggplant parm and it was delightfully non-Italian American, but so well prepared. Decor was nothing special. Highly recommend, but not easy to find.< /review></record>

Not good, how do you burn the crust on the pizza so bad that it's black and then pop it in a box and sell it. Thought I would give it a shot but never again.< /Text>

Drove up to enjoy the scenery  on Highway  1 on A nice Saturday  afternoon.  We drove up to Pacifica and looked up Good fellas, caught our  eye that they had pizza and a variety of  Pasta. Our SCARFACE pizza and Jumbo Wings and Garlic fries  were Delicious!!!! I'd  drive any day way up here to enjoy Dinner again!!! Awesome  Service!!!< /Text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>Townie pizza parlors are typically always hit and miss.  Good Fellas provides good pizza at a good rate, with a decent beer bar and is a place where I always see my friends.  The kids can run around in the strip mall out back, and the food is straight forward and satisfying.

GF's is a meeting point, a dad night dinner, and a valley resource in Pacifica.< /text>< Pictures>

Person on the phone seemed bothered she had to work (i understand its Saturday night). Pizza came, no plates parm cheese, or even napkins... when i called back to ask she said i needed to "request" those items. Plates i get. Napkins?! I'll be ordering from somewhere else next time, where they know pizza comes with napkins. I'm staying at a hotel i don't have these at my disposal. It should be COMMON SENSE people need napkins with a pizza. And I've never ordered a pizza in my life that didn't come with parm cheese and red pepper packets. If it needs to be requested, it should be offered by your salesperson. Lost a customer.<//Review>

They had the football game on. That was fun to have beer and some wings. The wings came out slow though. Not sure about their spicy sauce and ranch. Wasn't a fan of the sauces. had the scarface pizza. it was thin crust and a great value. prices were good, but again, the sauce didn't do it for me. fun atmosphere, food is ok.  Service was nice.<//text>

Food was ok but service was not the best. It was a Monday. They seemed busy, but were also training a new person. As everyone ran around doing their job, I guess, they just had her standing there giving her no opportunity to help. And they needed the help. Also, the female who seemed like the shift manager kept snacking as she was running around. Even while she was making my salad. I wasn't very thrilled about that.<//Text>

<Text>Been going to Good Fellas for a few years and have truly enjoyed their pizza. But over the 6 months to a year the quality to the pizza has gone down hill as they no longer seem to use the same  quality and quantity of items on the pizza.

But was shocked when they charged me additional $2.50 for garlic.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Very cozy cafe if you catch it on a slow day, good coffee and food. Has plugs to charge your stuff and plug your laptop but no wifi :( This place is mellower then the other Chit-chat thats run by the girls.<//Text>

< review>
A while back, we decided to try Goodfellas Pizza.  It wasn't very good.  Thick chewy mushroom stems and a soggy crust.  I placed a review on Yelp accordingly.  Someone from Goodfellas wrote me a private message agreeing that the pizzas were not coming out well that night and he would like to make it up to me by giving me a complimentary pizza.

I responded that I would give it a try but he never responded back - empty promise.  I therefore allowed my review to stand.  This review is an edited version of the original.

At least year went by and we were craving pizza, Goodfellas was the only one open and we thought, hey, let's give them one more shot.  (There are sadly so few good choices here in Pacifica.)  We had them deliver a pizza with pesto, mushroom and artichoke hearts - NO RED SAUCE.  What we got was a pizza with red sauce and no pesto, plus the other ingredients.  I called them and explained what I had received and a female manager came to the phone and said she would send out another pizza that was correct.  I told her the last one had taken nearly an hour, it was late and we would prefer to have them make it up to us another way.  The manager told me that when I order next, the pizza would be complimentary to make up for the mistaken pizza.  I even asked her how that would happen and she stated that she would put a notation in my account accessible through my telephone number.  I thanked her.

Last night, I called Goodfellas to order that pizza.  I was told all they could do is knock off 10%.  Really?  I explained what had been promised based upon what had happened last time and a manager was brought to the phone.  She told me that all she was authorized to do is take 10% off otherwise she would have to call the owner/manager.  After a few minutes, a man called and identified himself as the owner.  He began by scolding me for using Yelp as a way to threaten and how do I think he feels hearing this, etc.  I told him I thought his customer service skills were lacking.  I reiterated my history (read above) with the business, essentially being owed at least one pizza but reminding him that my first experience with them was also a failure and a pizza was promised then, and then ignored after I accepted.  I pointed out that on two separate occasion, Goodfellas had sold me either a bad pizza (acknowledged by him) or a completely wrong pizza, and in both circumstances, promises of a complimentary pizza were made and later denied.

At the end of the phone conversation, the owner told me he doesn't feel like honoring those promises.  I used a "naughty" phrase and hung up the phone.

Bad, bad business.  Poor customer service and dishonest policies.  Never again Goodfellas!  I'd rather order an excellent pizza and have Waiters on Wheels deliver it.</review>

<text>Tonight ensured that I will never ever order from them again.

1) Delivery took almost 1hr 30mins  and I even called at the one hour mark and was reassured it was on it's way.

2) Usually they give a nice amount of bread for the past but this was stale and only 2 small pieces.

3) ordered bagda cala (roasted garlic) we order this a lot but tonight the container was almost empty. Also it comes with toasted bread and I asked for soft bread cause my teeth hurt and they told me they would have to charge to switch bread...seriously.

4) Ordered veggie lasagna and it's all mozerella and some mushrooms and carrots. GROSS!!! (I'm starving and preggers so I have no choice but to eat this becasue we have nothing else to eat at home)

5) The bf let me try his pasta and it was so gross I had to spit it out... wow the quality has gone down MAJORLY....what happened????

Called to ask them to bring a new order of the garlic and was told that conveniently that their manager had just walked out the door and they couldn't do anything. I then ask if they could please send me a salad and take back the lasagna and they said they couldn't do anything.  Wow... thank Goodfellas... leave me starving when I'm home on bedrest and can't get out to get food. You already took my money so it's not like I can call a diffrent delivery service. Shame on you!!!!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>As a Scotsman who likes good Indian style food. After two weeks of traveling around California it was a delight to see such a restaurant and even better to sample the delights of the food. The variety of the menu was excellent with all the usual foods you would expect and some extras as well. The service was very friendly and efficient, considering they were also hosting a wedding banquet in a separate area. The portions were large enough for two average eaters and the value for money was very good as well. The waiters advice was accurate and he was accommodating to our questions and needs.  The quality of the food was very good, with Pakora of both meat and veg, the Rita and spicy sauce where very flavoursome. The main meal had bags of favour and the rice fluffy as it should be, the breads were hot and tasty.  This meal goes down as the best meal of the holiday by all four of us. If I'm ever back in the Orange county area or LA in general, I will definitely make a point of stopping by for a meal. Keep up the good work. Well Done.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

We hosted our mom and dad's 50th anniversary at Amaya Lounge. The food was delicious. They helped us decide the menu and details with ease.The service was unbelievably good. The  arrangements, decor, help, and just everything was par excellence. We will definitely go back again for our next party. 3 Cheers to the new management who recently took this restaurant over.</text>

It was a bummer for sure. Food was bland, beer was not beer but malt liquor and waitstaff interrogated me for not eating the food when I asked for the check after waiting in front of my plate for half an hour. I payed to sample terrible food and sit uncomfortably for an hour and a half that was pretty much the experience. despite not really being able to eat much, it was creepy enough to let me go without an appetite at all, when I was finally allowed to leave....addendum; it is what it is. This was my last meal in town and it was a bummer. I appreciate the offer though. Obviously nothing personal; I just have already spent the time.< /review>

I'd say it was actually over a year ago that I visited this place I got a notary signature from this place everybody inside is absolutely delightful and wonderful very sweet I enjoyed going there more than just about any other store in Antioch or Northern California I definitely suggest you visit if not to buy something just to see how nice actually people could be and their stores actually really cute they have a lot of neat stuff so thank you again to the apnabazar you guys are awesome I can't wait to visit you again<//text>

Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks, they have been caring for our Puppies for over a year now. This last visit  was a great experience, as always! Dr. Jody and the Team are always engaging, insightful, pet care focused and certainly exemplify professionalism! I highly recommend them for your pets.</Review>

This is a wonderful place to bring your pets. Over the years they have helped us with simple issues to very serious issues and the staff has always been very kind and compassionate. They clearly understand that our pets are special parts of our family and they take the time to understand our needs and concerns.
Their facility has no fancy bells or whistles and it can be a little pricey, but the care that you receive is incredible.< /review>

Great Vet! Dr. Bass follow up care is second to none… Even during this trying time of Covid-19 she is making sure your concerns are answered and addressed. I am very happy with her service and care of my fur baby!</Review>

<Review>Cannot say enough good things about this office. Dr Bass and her team are outstanding!  We had an incident with our boxer that was touch n go. Dr Bass called everyday to inquire on his progress. Very knowledgeable. Then we followed up with the staff via texts. We received immediate answers at every turn. You can tell their heart in what they do. We trust them 100%. You will too. Thank you Dr Bass and thanks to your amazing team 🙏<//Review><rating>5</rating><Gmap_id>0x80e82ff0558e46fd:0x718078c3134c4a46</Gmap_id>< Name>

<Review>The Vet gives great service overall in terms of their knowledge and demeanor with our pets.

The reason for the 2 star is directly tied to cost of services. Vet visits are above the average cost, which is understandable as they have great service. The cost of additional services (blood tests) is substantially higher then competitors. I was able to find blood tests at half the costs they are charging.

My personal experience is as follows. My wife brought our dog into the Vet for an increased dosage of seizure medication. The previous visits we signed waivers of liability to avoid having the blood test. This wasn’t acceptable this time for the dosage change. I was quoted a price for the test which I felt was extremely high, and confirmed with quotes I have received from others, and declined to pay the amount. Upon leaving I was charged for a office visit. I feel since I didn’t receive any prescription or medical procedure the cost of the visit should have been waived.

Regardless, this is a good vet but comes with a high cost of services.</Review><gmap_id>0x80e82ff0558e46fd:0x718078c3134c4a46< /gmap_id><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

Having recently adopted a Siberian Husky we were in the need for a great Vet. I did a web search and came across several vets in my area. Lucky for me we live just a few min from the Animal Hospital of TO as they had decent online reviews. I called them first thing Monday morning and they were able to get me in for his first checkup within 2 hours! That made me quite happy as it can be hard for same day appointments. To not get too wordy here, the front staff was very nice and sweet to my dog and offered to help me any way they could. The Dr. spent ample time talking to me, explaining everything clearly to me and answering all of my questions. She also spent time talking to me about how to maintain a quality life for my dog, which meant a lot to me.

I can easily recommend this Vet to any family or friend that may ask as I could tell after the first visit that this was the caring Vet I was hoping to find!<//Review>

Dr. Milburn is THE BEST!  Outstanding service!  I am so impressed with Dr. Milburn's detective work in figuring out what was wrong with my dog.  I thought he had a tummy ache but it turns out he has a back problem.  Only an expert diagnostician like Dr. Milburn could have figured it out!  She's so observant and has a great bedside manner.  Thank you so much!  Staff is attentive and on top of everything.<//review>

All the staff is amazing!!!!! I remember when I first went there, Louie was very sick and needed a shot to basically live. I couldn't afford it at the time. I just moved, I was a mess crying in the office. I didnt even get approved for the credit care because I just went through someone stealing my identity. The vet trusted me, she gave Louie the shot and gave me a payment plan. Its unheard of at a vet's office they even do that!!! But she trusted me and saved Louie's life. The staff is amazing and I'm forever grateful.</Text>

I highly recommend the Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks, based on many years of using this vet practice. The doctors are highly skilled diagnosticians, and always demonstrate true concern for their patients.  They take time to fully explain results of examinations and all possible treatment options.  In addition, the medical support staff are also very competent and gentle, making any visits or treatments as comfortable as possible for my pet family. The front office staff are unfailingly helpful and friendly, making sure that appointments are conveniently scheduled, all questions are answered, and our needs are met.  The doctors and staff always follow up with phone calls to check on their patients and are available for additional advice, when needed.  It truly gives me peace of mind to know that the Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks is available to take care of my beloved animals, and I have full confidence in the outstanding quality of care this veterinary practice provides.< /text>

<Review>I have been taking my dogs to Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks for about 25 years, so that says it all.  The vets are outstanding, the techs are wonderful, and the office staff are the best.  Everyone is kind, caring, patient, compassionate, and my current dog who is a rescue and afraid of everything, is not terrified of going to the vet. I would recommend his vets to everyone.< /Review>< gmapID>

Our service dog in training, Ember, has been going here since she was a pup. Kobe our family dog has been going here since we switch vets three years ago. We have always had a professional, welcoming experience; from the front end staff, vet techs, to all the doctors. Making a last minute appointment has never been an issue.  Non emergency questions are answered promptly. I highly recommend this vet!!!!</Review>

<Text>I have only been coming here for a little less than a year and so far have been pretty satisfied.  The vet that I have seen seems to be very nice and the staff is as well. However unlike my previous vet who retired there is no follow-up at this office as I was previously always contacted the following day no matter what I came in for to see how my pet was doing that has been a little disappointed. Also the prices are extremely high I have never gotten out of there for under $100.</Text>< pictures>

Over the years last nine years the Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks has cared for our six pets (two deceased due to advanced age). In every instances the vets, techs, and front office have been friendly, knowledgeable, professional, caring, and extremely capable. I can't imagine a practice I would rather have care for my pets.<//review>

<text>I have two little dogs that are brothers.  My vet closed approx. 6 years ago and I have been going to Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks since..They have been pretty healthly so really the only time I have taken them in was for small things..nails cut, anal glands, etc. things like that..Our little Baxter just got so excited when he got to go to the "doctors" ..they were always real nice (expensive) to the dogs..This past Wednesday our little Baxter was breathing heavier then normal..so I called and Dr. Bass saw him..After doing blood work and x-ray she told me that I had caught it right away but he had chf (congestive heart failure) however she felt he would be fine after taking some Lasix to release the fluid..So I left feeling so good..I gave him his meds that she gave him, but the next day he seemed to be worse..I called Dr Bass and she talked to me right away..(this was on Friday) she adjusted his meds..I asked her if he got worse what would I do because she was not in until Monday again..She told me that the office was open till 1:00 on Saturday and if I needed them to call..Well, my poor sweet baby by morning was really laboring to breathe..I called the office around 10:00, I told the recepitionist what was going on..I told her that Dr. Bass had told me to call and come in..She said ok and I held on the phone until she talked to Dr Milburn, she came back to tell me that Dr. Milburn said to go to the emergency clinic..I said no..Baxter just had all his tests there..Dr. Bass told me to call..he needs a Lasix shot..she repeated again "Well, I can only tell you that Dr. Milburn is too busy with an emergency on a dog and wants you to go to the clinic..I told her I understood but he needs a lasix shot..I asked what time will she be available?  She had me hold and came back with a very nasty "Well, if you want to bring him in she will only give him a lasix shot"  Dr. Milburn could have cared less..I said you are open till 1:00 then the recepitionist said no we are closing today at 12:00..
I called my daughter in tears..she called her vet that hadn't seen little Baxter..it was Agoura Animal Clinic they had me bring him in ,  by the time I got there he was breathing even harder the Vet put him on oxygen..and how loving he was to my little guy..right away he said he didn't think it was from the CHF he wanted to take a 3 D xray..(they had called Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks to get Baxters chart)(they had to call for the third time because the receptionist said he was not a patient) but funny after the third call from me and Agoura they finally found the chart and sent it..The vet took a 3 D xray and found that "Little Baxter" had a large mass in his liver and it was probably cancerous..with his breathing they could do nothing..I didn't want to put our little 8 ib. Baxter through that and felt I needed to let him go for him..
I tell this because I have raved about Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks..however, it was never something critcal that was needed, this was the first time one of my "babies" needed real help..I don't blame Dr. Bass I like her as a vet and if she would have been on I feel she would have tried to help Baxter..but Dr. Milburn has in my opinion zero empathy when one of their patients are in trouble..She showed her true colors.

AHTO has been our vet for nearly 15 years. I can't recommend them enough. They stay on top of the latest in veterinary medicine and are the loveliest people. If you're in need of a vet in the Conejo Valley, this is the place to go.<//review>

AHTO is the best vet office in the county!  The doctors and entire staff are compassionate, caring and treat your fur kids with gentleness and respect. You can tell as soon as you are greeted by the fri t desk staff that they are a team and love caring for animals.  They also are excellent in calling and checking up after our dog had a procedure done to find out how she was doing.  Our family will not go anywhere else!</Text>

I have been with AHTO for a lot of years, the staff is always warm and welcoming. The supporting staff and veterinarians provide awesome service. I have 3 dogs and they never are nervous or scared to come to see the vet! They treat pets like family. I recommend AHTO to anyone who needs a great vet, reasonable prices and excellent service.< /review>

Not only is everyone friendly and knowledgeable but the professionalism and quality of care are unbeatable.  I have such a level of trust with the doctors and staff that it would be unthinkable to even consider having anyone else treat my animals.

<Text>We have been coming here for about 8 years.  I live in Woodland Hills so it's not right around the corner but I firmly believe when you find a doctor (or any service provider you like), no matter the distance, you stick with it!  I have never been in the office and had a negative experience with either the staff or the doctors.  Vets need to have a bedside manner just as much as our doctors do and they have that nailed down here!  My dog started having idiopathic grand mal seizures almost 3 years ago, at the age of 10.  Thus needing more frequent office visits as well as medications.  Yet I still choose to drive the almost 20 miles each way to ensure that my precious dog gets to see Dr. Klumb and the rest of the amazing staff.   You walk in the door and everyone just smiles and greets you by name.  They know their clients and you never feel like just another appointment.  I've recommended them to a couple of people who have since started making the drive as well after meeting the Dr.s and staff.
You cannot put a price on the kind of care they deliver but if you could, I don't think I could come up with a number high enough to express my gratitude and trust!<//Text>< Pics>

From the beginning, I could see that Dr. Klumb was a cat person. Instead of dragging Nelly out of her carrier, she removed the top, & gently lifted her out. Nelly was reasonably calm, because a towel containing pheromones had previously been placed over her carrier.Dr. Klumb thoroughly examined my kitty for any sign of fleas, & concluded that she probably had a flea allergy which would explain why she was licking her fur obsessively. She made some recommendations re: this problem, & also her weight gain. I intend to return to the Animal Hospital in a month or so for Dr. Klumb to check on the results.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>First of all, I never write reviews.  Good or bad.  I rely on them, but, never write them.  I am making an exception here because Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks (AHTO) is exceptional!

There is nothing like the peace of mind of knowing your pet is in good hands.  I have been taking my maltese/yorkie mix, Henry, to the AHTO since he was a puppy (almost six years).  Whether it's Dr. Sharon Bass, Cindie, Deanna, Julie or anyone else at AHTO, Henry is always treated like he's their favorite "patient".  If you want quality care, great bedside manner and peace of mind, then look no further, you have found your vet!  Your pet will thank you.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80e82ff0558e46fd:0x718078c3134c4a46</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Animal Hospital of Thousand Oaks is by far the optimum clinic in the Conejo Valley. Dr. Bass, Dr. Klumb, and Dr. Milburn will use their medicinal techniques to beat down any mischievious bacteria that are irritating your pet. The veterinary technicians are always ready to assist a doctor or a pet when coming out of dentistry, surgery etc. The front staff is always welcoming patients with a glistening smile to have you seated in a room. The organization of this clinic will surely beat any other clinics in the Conejo Valley in my opinion. Dr. Barr is the brilliant woman who opened up this clinic, who manages everything from her office! I have been taking my Anatolian Shepherd here ever since he was a puppy (3.5 years). He loves all of the staff as they do to him wishing for him to get better whenever he is ill. Luckily, he is rarely sick do to the wonderful doctors and technicians!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Dr Bass was the kind of vet I’ve been looking for. She offered all solutions. And the best part- her solution has worked wonders, our cat is back to her old self!! We weren’t sure she was going to make it at all even after coming home from 2 days in emergency. Thank you Dr Bass!< /text>

Sierra Circuits is always Arable's go-to vendor whenever we need a design critical need to validate thru PCB fab and assembly. Having worked at bigger companies like IBM, Apple, the uniqueness of Sierra's lies in the quality of technical questions (TQs) they raise to ensure PCB is fab'd and assembled accurately with all minute details sorted out prior. I'd recommend Sierra to anyone without a blink.<//review>

From my 30+ years as a pcb designer Sierra Circuits clearly deserves 5 stars. Based on two HS 8 layer complex impedance designs I found there process for both designs to be exceptional, Sierra was easy to work with, pricing was reasonable, the boards were delivered on time, and they both worked immediately upon our team receiving each full turn-key set off boards. Thanks much, Dennis</text>

Our PCBs have generally been 6-12 layers with track width/spacing at times of 4 mils. These have generally been controlled dielectric. We have had excellent engineering support to remove data issues that could impact PCB assembly. They are competitively priced and the quality of PCB has been excellent.

< Review>
The main advantages of ordering turn-key parts in Sierra Circuits: thorough check of the turn-key project allows to identify and fix many design issues in the pre-production phase; сonvenient, automated system of interaction with the customer; can get turn-key in a very short time; high quality PCB and assembly. Thanks.</Review>

<Text>I don't normally write reviews, but since all of these seem to be older, and not reflective of what I have seen, I thought I might write a quick review. Customer service seems to be much improved from a year ago. They were pretty quick to respond in their review process of my board. None of my prototypes have ever arrived late. In fact I had one order arrive two days early. I would say their quality is above average. Seems like they got their stuff together over the last year.< /Text>< pictures>

They provide DFM reviews in preparation of quote and build that has allowed my team to fix numerous issues.

Can someone kindly tell me why they recently start to charge extra $800 fixture cost for assembly two PCB boards? In the past with the similar PCB board, they never charge that.<//text>

This company does not pay its bills, still owes me tens of thousands of dollars for contract marketing services. If asked to perform work, get paid before delivery.  You've been warned.</Review>

<Text>Sierra Circuits is always Arable's go-to vendor whenever we need a design critical need to validate thru PCB fab and assembly. Having worked at bigger companies like IBM, Apple, the uniqueness of Sierra's lies in the quality of technical questions (TQs) they raise to ensure PCB is fab'd and assembled accurately with all minute details sorted out prior. I'd recommend Sierra to anyone without a blink.< /Text>< resp>

Based on two HS 8 layer complex impedance designs I found there process for both designs to be exceptional, Sierra was easy to work with, pricing was reasonable, the boards were delivered on time, and they both worked immediately upon our team receiving each full turn-key set off boards.

<Review>We have been working with Sierra Circuits for over a decade and have had many PCBs manufactured by them. Our PCBs have generally been 6-12 layers with track width/spacing at times of 4 mils. These have generally been controlled dielectric. We have had excellent engineering support to remove data issues that could impact PCB assembly. They are competitively priced and the quality of PCB has been excellent.
Keep up the good work!<//Review>< Pics>

The main advantages of ordering turn-key parts in Sierra Circuits: thorough check of the turn-key project allows to identify and fix many design issues in the pre-production phase; сonvenient, automated system of interaction with the customer; can get turn-key in a very short time; high quality PCB and assembly. Thanks.<//text>

<Text>I don't normally write reviews, but since all of these seem to be older, and not reflective of what I have seen, I thought I might write a quick review. Customer service seems to be much improved from a year ago. They were pretty quick to respond in their review process of my board. None of my prototypes have ever arrived late. In fact I had one order arrive two days early. I would say their quality is above average. Seems like they got their stuff together over the last year.</Text><user_name>Parker Henzel< /user_name><Rating>5</Rating>< gmap_id>

Extremely easy to work with and very fast on quotes and builds without conformal coat.

They provide DFM reviews in preparation of quote and build that has allowed my team to fix numerous issues.

I run much of my CCA needs through them</review>

Many great wines that we enjoy in California and known in the world come from Paso Robles. Justin is a must to visit while in Paso, please ( not sure if is still available after covid-19) be sure to book a tour, while seating down at the bar and enjoy many of wine from the portfolio, nothing compares to the tour that will take you everywhere in the vineyard, including the famous isosceles cellar and private dinner table underneath nestled underneath a mountain. This tour won't let you down, as you visit different spots wine will be pour from different vintages and styles. Be sure to book in advance as this kind of tour won't be available for walk ins.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>This is the worst restaurant experience that we have encountered. I normally don't give any bad reviews, especially during COVID 19 since the restaurants and wineries are facing a challenging time. However, I was so upset about our visit on April 24. It's our first time visited Justin Winery and Restaurant. When the hostess led us (party of three) to our table, it's in the hallway and right next to a door with a lot of traffics which guests and waiters will walk around. I especially mentioned that we don't feel comfortable with our mask off eating while a bunch of people is walking around. I pointed to an empty table of 4 seats in the garden area if we can switch to that table, but I was told by the hostess that "according to their policy", the table of 4 seats is only serving for 4 guests. While kept asking, they (with an impatient attitude) finally willing to switch us to the garden area. Guess what?? I have seen few tables of 4 seats over there only seated with two or three guests. I was so shocked but still tried to remain polite and say thank you to the hostess, and she just turned her head and walked away.  I don't know how the restaurant trains their staff, the hostess is rude and their service is appalling. It was our first time visiting Justin and will be our last time as well.</Review></record>

<Time>1597697471602<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Justin is a premium winery with excellent tasting options and food which will match any high end restaurant.

Located in the middle of the Paso Robles vineyards, it’s an excellent scenic drive to their establishment. When you arrive, you drive on loose gravel and are greeted by a welcoming staff.

Besides the excellent wine, the staff here are exceptional and very geared towards making your stay that much more enjoyable. You’re treated like royalty.

The seating area is booked right up against the vineyards which makes for a wonderful viewing. When tasting wine, it gives you a great sensation of tasting what you can see and makes you imagine the process of turning the grapes into the succulent nectar of wine, From farm to wine glass.

Price wise it is expensive, but they offer an excellent deal where for ever $100 you spend on wine bottles to go, the tasting fee ($35-$55) is completely waived. This made for an excellent tasting experience and if you plan on getting bottles to go, makes it a no brainer to do the bottles to go.

This is my personal favorite winery of all time and over the years, each wine has failed to disappoint. Their blends make for an exceptional tasting experience where taste buds are taken on a journey from a light hearted rose to a full bodied blend which takes you to euphoria.

Definitely a must for Paso Robles and is always on my list anytime I find myself in the area.<//Review>< Pics>

Their website said open at 10, the sign by their front door said open at 10. I got there just before 10. They do not open until 11. The guy who "helped" me yesterday was unfriendly and unwilling to cooperate in order for me to have a good experience.

This was my first time to Justin Winery.  Having had their wine previously, I knew this was going to be good.  The wines were fantastic and Larry "the table guy" who served us was gracious and explained the wines to us.  Overall a great experience and I recommend anyone to go.<//review>

We really enjoyed our time here. The wine was great the food was great. A small downside is that the facility is far in the countryside and not near anything else. Even with that, we would go back.<//text>

Great winery in Paso Robles to spend the afternoon. Try their Isosceles and Focus wines. Do the private tasting by the Castle  and enjoy the view of the vineyards at their outdoor restaurant. Our burgers were a bit overcooked but they make it up to us. Their service was great!

I absolutely love Justin Wines, especially the Isosoles.
This was our experience...
After being completely WOWED by Law Winery... their customer service was fantastic, knowledgeable and very intimate. My expectations for Justin was big based on what I had heard and the price point for their wines.
Customer service was completely shocking.
Our server.....shirt wrinkled, hair unkept, unable to make any eye contact....her idea of describing wine at best was that it is "heaven".  At one point she brought back out our last two flights and said she needed to leave them at our table because close to closing the wine just seems to dissappear.  After purchasing $700 worth of wine we asked for a few more drops of wine and her response was all bottles were closed now.  Even though they were getting ready for dinner.
She got a $20 tip but I feel like that was actually generous for the service received. Never want to go back.<//text>

Excellent wine tasting flight (if a bit pricey). They also serve some food (really good cheese platter and charcuterie). A bit hot in July but a well covered patio with sky fans made it one of the best tasting experiences I've had<//Review>

Great service and nice layout! You are also able to enjoy food here which is not common at most wineries here in Paso. They also have a small inn to stay on property.<//Text>

We had lunch with friends and were promptly seated, however, that was the end of the speedy service. We waited for over 15 minutes for another wine glass, my wife had to get up and retrieve a glass from the bar. We continued to wait for our waitress while conversing, but after more than 20 minutes, no waitress had approached our table. We waived a wItress asking what the delay was. Finally a waitress took our order and proceeded to get our water. Again, we waited at least another 10 minutes until she took our order. We waited and waited, but our order was nowhere in sight. When they finally brought our order the order was not correct. It was unfortunate since our friends were there and left very disappointed with the service.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80ed29f7f823a82d:0xb550b7414f39c66d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
We're members and had only been to the Tasting room in Downtown Paso Robles. We were impressed with the winery location and facilities. We sat on the patio because we had our dog with us and they were quite accommodating. We did make a reservation. We look forward to more visits. We want to do the tours, especially the Cave Tour.<//Review>

We went for a quick wine tasting, ordered the Cheeseburger with fries. They were quick with the order and wine came out timely. Cheeseburger was tasty and fries were skinny and also cooked just right. We liked the Rose on the wine tasting menu.</Text>

The tasting facility is very beautiful and new, you are enveloped by the allure of wine and vineyard.
Our hostess Krystal was as sweet and down to earth as she could be and made us feel very comfortable.
The wine was absolutely lovely.
We tasted out on the "upper patio" and quickly learned that no tasting was allowed on the lower patio in the sun (it was chilly outside), that was our first indication of "not friendly".
Finished our tasting, my friend went into the tasting room/gift shop to use the restroom. I stayed outside for a few moments and followed there after.
As soon as I entered the tasting room a man approached me, and curtly asked if he could help me.
Honestly, I felt like I was trespasser in the way he addressed me!
(I am 63 years old, well dressed, and unassuming)
Good lawd...and then approached by another man in almost the same fashion. Really took me by surprise...these people need to chill.
That being said, the tasting atmosphere at Justin is very snooty and almost paranoid.
If you can get past that, the wine is fabulous.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ6EFa1egQXEtjjzWNE__S9J-ffrs8Tr43oJiB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

The wine may be fabulous but the attitude of the hosts left a bitter taste. With a near monopoly on wine tasting and outdoor dining in the Nacimiento area, the hosts attitude seemed to be - you're lucky to get a spot at Justin winery restaurant. That may be true but graciousness is valuable and was lacking. During Covid times we all need to show a little grace.< /text>

Had a great lunch with beautiful scenery of the vineyard. Flavorful food. Wines are really good. We had the 2013 isocoles with our meal. There is poor to no cell reception out here so have your Uber driver wait for you.<//Review>

Love the view here, and it's always full of people from LA and the Bay. It's nestled in a beautiful valley outside Paso Robles, and the drive there is a thrill for those who enjoy winding curvy roads with blind curves and blind hills. There are moments when you literally creat a hill and you don't know if the road will curve to the right or left or if there'll be a drop of several feet. Beautiful road. The winery itself has great ambience, and is family friendly to a degree. Their outdoor seating is comfortable and tables are far apart from each other to afford some privacy and ensures nobody feels bothered by another group. Truly lovely corner of California here.</text>

<Time>1599779667129< /Time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Ordered case of 2017 Cab from their website for $236. Wine arrives today and the bottles are clanking in the box.  I open the box and discover they are half bottles stuck in full bottle packing hence the reason for the noise. Photo on their site doesn’t show it next to a regular sized bottle it looks like a regular bottle. Price was about what I buy a regular bottle for at Sams Club. Shame on me, I just looked at the picture and the price and assumed it was the same size.

I reached out to them and their reply was we state it is a 375ml and the photo clearly shows the smaller bottle. Then says “cheers”.

Whatever Justin. Won’t buy your wine again.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80ed29f7f823a82d:0xb550b7414f39c66d< /GmapID></record>

I love Justin Wines and was really excited to make the pilgrimage to the vineyard.  My girlfriend and I arrived early for a tasting and found the tasting room sterile, boring, and lacking of character and vibe.  The employees were distracted, not at all excited, and the wine pours took much longer than they should have.  Its a shame because the wines have a great reputation, but unfortunately, i must report that the vineyard is worth a skip.  Your time and money will be better spent at a more intimate venue that feels less like a wine factory, and more like an experience, and that's coming from a fan.</text>

Nice place good food. We both had the Chilaquiles (pictured). Very tasty. We decided against wine and went with the coffee. It's the real thing, strong and delicious. Servers were attentive, friendly and efficient. Beautiful setting too, if a bit out of the way.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>Although we're from Lodi in Northern California where we have dozens of wineries that make exceptional wines one of our very favorite wineries is Justin.  We've been members of Justin for several years and we always look forward to attending the Harvest Festival Dinner in October but because our son is getting married at the same time as the Harvest Dinner this year we decided to go in August and have dinner at the Restaurant at Justin and it was amazing!!!  The dinner menu is prix fixe and some might think it's a bit pricey but it was worth every single cent!  Our server was Amanda and she did a wonderful job of describing each course of food and wine.  Each course was so thought out and tasty and the wine pairings were perfect!  Thank you Amanda for making our experience so great, we can't wait to come back!!!<//review>< pictures>

<review>Felt like the prices were extremely overpriced. Expensive tastings for what they pour. Better off buying a few glasses of something you enjoy..

Also had lunch and ordered the burger. Looked amazing and perfectly cooked medium rare; however, it was dry like meatloaf. Imagine they don't do a appropriate meat to fat ratio which is what dictates juiciness which it completely lacked.< /review></record>

Absolute perfection! The tasting room and porch are lovely. There's a cute shop, Fiji water is served and the staff are awesome! Rachel took such good care of us and went out of her way to help us get into the tour. We had wine shipped to our home in AZ and it only took a few days for delivery.

The tour: So much fun! Make sure to schedule in advance because it's only twice a day and only 10 people are allowed on each tour. Anthony was our tour guide and did a fantastic job. It lasted about an hour and was partially in door, partially out door.

Oh and the wine is excellent :)</Text>

< review>
If there was a way to give no stars for my recent experience at Justin Winery I would.  I decided to take my entire office staff on a wine tasting trip for their Christmas Party.  I had never been to Justin Winery, so this winery was the one that I was most excited to visit.  When we arrived, luckily, it was not very busy.  There were maybe 5 tables outside and 5 people inside the winery tasting room.  We sat down and waited to be greeted.  When our wine representative came over to the table, Gregory, he was less than friendly.  He did not smile, nor did he try and talk with us to see why we were there, the reason for the visit, etc.  He also did not explain the wines that we would be tasting.  We got our first pour of wine after about 10 to 15 minutes of waiting.  During this time, one of my staff members told Gregory that one of his family members wanted to join the wine club.  Of course, he immediately started working on that on the phone inside.  After we waited and waited for our second pour of wine, one of my employees finally had to go into the actual building and ask for a second pour from another wine representative.  When, Gregory finally finished his phone call and came out with the second pour of wine, he made a comment about my staff member that went into the building to ask for our second pour.  After rolling his eyes, he stated, "Well if she would just quit hounding me" I would come out here and pour wine.  This was the first time anyone had went inside the building.  Gregory was unprofessional, extremely rude, and an outright negative individual.  I have no idea how he would even be able to obtain a job such as this.  Because of my experience with Gregory, I may never go back to Justin.  It is too bad because the wine is very nice!</review>

<review>One of my favorite wines and has been for more than 2 decades.  And you can imagine my excitement when I found out that a family members vineyard (emerald hills) got chosen to supply grapes.   Guess I will be drinking this even more.<//review>< GmapID>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>The wines are always great. I can't say that for the person giving us the tastings. It could have been a really busy day, but we spent most of the afternoon waiting for FOUR tastings out on the patio and almost left because it took so long. Either more staff was needed or like I said, it could have been an off day for them. The lady got our groups orders wrong and I ended up walking inside to buy my wine because I probably would have had to wait and extra 30 min or so just to put my order in. The tasting fee is $25 or it's waived if you make a purchase of $75 or more.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I drove from Morro Bay all the way to Paso for Justin and it was 100% worth it. If you like cabs and red blends, you will love this place. Even their Rose surprised me.

Justin is a long time fixture in the Paso Robles wine scene with a long time reputation of producing fine wines. However, to my palate the wines have lost much of their luster and on a recent visit we found the "new", bigger tasting room to be modern but cold, impersonal, crowded and loud. Not at all an improvement from their smaller and cozier tasting experience provided by the prior owners. And now there are many winemakers in the area making as good or better wines... at lesser prices.<//Review>

Beautiful winery with a nice restaurant. Dina served our wine outside on the patio.

The food menu is somewhat limited and a bit pricey, but very enjoyable, especially out on the patio. I’ll definitely return<//review>

One of the best winery to visit on Paso Robles area. 3 main areas: dining room, patio, bbq area overseeing the winery.

Wine tasting costs about $30++/person.
Need RSVP for dining.

Membership doesnt cost anything, only need to buy a few bottles per year, waived wine tasting if taking this membership chance.<//Text><Name>wander olin< /Name>< Rating>

<review>Stopped for lunch and wine. Beautiful setting and great food. Templeton Valley Greens Salad with a generous portion of grilled chicken, Ora King Salmon with a nice pesto paired with a glass of Justin Sauvignon Blanc and Reserve Tempranillo. One of the best meals on our recent trip to Paso Robles.<//review>< Pictures>

Great facility, great wine, and the staff are so knowledgeable.

Justin takes the French philosophy to wine making by embracing the blends.  I don't believe I tasted a single wine made from one specific varietal... such as Cabernet Sauvignon.</Text>

The restaurant is wonderful. Best pancakes I have ever had. Just the right combo of added ricotta cheese and berries. Tip: wine tasting is free if you eat at the restaurant. They have heaters outside. Great views of the vineyards beyond. Wines are exceptional and impeccable service.<//review>

Probably the most visually stunning vineyard I've ever been too. I was awestruck all day by the surrounding landscape of Justin Vineyards. The wine is still good, but the view here is absolutely exceptional. The people who created this property had an amazing image of what they wanted this place to look like! They knocked it out of the park!! #1 place I'd suggest to visit in Paso. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</Text>

More than we expected.  Read the reviews while driving up, so anticipating "Napa valley", we got quite the excellent experience instead.  Note:  Wednesday afternoon, showed up for tasting, and wine / cave tour of the operation.  Everyone we met was warm and personable, making us (not wine experts) feel at home.  Our Justin tour guide (Crystal) turned out to be super friendly and knowledgeable.  She patiently answered all of our questions too.  We look forward to visiting a second time in August during harvest.</review>

Overpriced, overhyped, corporate owned winery. Went for lunch. The food was tasteless, lacked seasoning, and was overcooked and mushy. Service was fine. Best part was the Negrantis sheep ice cream but you can get that in Paso for much less. Save time and money and go the hundreds of other wineries and restaurants in the area that have excellent wine and food at better prices.< /Review>

We visited Justin on 14 Oct 17 and I have to say had an amazing tour of your vineyard.
Our guide For the tour was great, he had great knowledge of the art of making wine,and sense of humour.
The wines we tasted were supperb and I have to say I would like to drink your Isosceles for the rest
of my life.but living in the UK makes that impossible, ( you need to export to UK ).Please.
Justin is a must visit if you love your wine and in the Paso Robles area.
We hope to be back one day.
Sue and Martin Cooper.< /text>

They didn't when we got there, but offered to make something. Service was horribly slow, portions were small and the comment at the table was "well at least it's edible". Not a glowing remark for what was not an inexpensive meal. Would not visit again.</Review>< Pics>

I am rating it this high for the lunch that we had at the restaurant. The hamburger was amazing, easily one of the best burgers I've eaten in my life. One of my friends got the pasta, and it was absolutely perfect. I tried two different wines as part of lunch, and both were very, very good. The location is idyllic, too. Waaaaay out in the country, on a patio surrounded by vineyards, next to the kitchen's vegetable garden. It is hard to beat.</review>

A great out of the way place to visit, with some very nice wines. My wife and I found the Zin’s to be the best for our budget. Hospitality was above expectations.

Their tasting menu is very good, and they frequently offer samples of their higher end reserve wines.  Their Cab is very good, the reserve cab is fantastic.  Some of the wines available are difficult to find, or unavailable, at other retail outlets.  The place is very corporate, but that is not bad too me. The tasting room is beautiful and modern. The staff is very friendly, and the restaurant and atmosphere...dare I say it...is worth the price.  Some of the comments here make me think that they were at a different winery, or that they were the reason behind the bad experience. You can find better wines in the area, but probably not a single vineyard with as many high quality wines.<//text>

We stopped in on a hot Saturday afternoon and Larry was our tasting guide.   He was friendly, professional and we learned plenty about the wines we sampled as well as the Justin Vineyard and history.  We had rookies and seasoned Wine veterans and Justin worked well with both.
Our tasting included:
2016 Viognier - Light, refreshingly perfect for the hot day.
2016 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon - Best Cabernet I've tasted this year.
2016 Reserve Tempranillo - Dark, deep, tasty.
2016 Reserve Malbec - Love Malbecs and this might be my new fav.  I purchased two bottles as souvenirs
2015 Isoceles Reserve - Award winner, lovely and I'll be stashing a bottle at home.

The lobby and showroom is spacious and organized well.  They have plenty of Justin items that covers souvenirs, apparel, to wine accessories of course.  You can also pick up some snacks, cheese, crackers to add to your tasting experience.

In the patio there's some great patio seating with great view of this lovely property with the vines and the mountains in the distance.  There are definitely plenty of social media moments here.  If in the area, Justin is a definite visit to enjoy some great wine and make even greater memories.  Cheers!</text>< Pictures>

Great tasting, great wine, pricey shopping. Had read about aloof staff but we had a nice young lady who was a fun part of our trip. "Cursive B"!< /review>

Ate lunch and did some wine tasting. Food was amazing, 5 star all the way. Wine tasting was OK. Wines are great but tasting experience is getting a bit more corporate feeling<//Review>

If I could pick a winery to be the flagship of Paso it would be JUSTIN. Superb wine, service, and ambiance. Their 2015 FOCUS syrah was the absolute best and worth every penny.</review>

We opened a bottle of Savant 2014; one of our favorite Justin wines, as part of our 4th of July celebration and our collection continues to improve with age.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Our new server told us at that the price was more than we were told when we came in because we had 8 people. That's after we had the wine tastings. I don't mind paying more but the to be told that after we had a tasting is not right. Sorry I bought a few bottles of wine.

Dinner at Justin was over-the-top great in every way:  service, food, wine, atmosphere.  Be prepared to pay big-city prices for it, but for a splurge or special occasion it's totally worth it.  The five-course prix fixe dinner was two hours of intense, perfectly matched flavors.  The wine pairings were amazing.  The Justin reserve cabernet is an incredible wine.  We would definitely make the (very long) drive again!< /text>

<review>Open and airy tasting room as well as ample seating in the outdoor section. The wines were decent and actually enjoyed their 2013 Cab and Justification blend more than their signature Isosceles. The Cab was very reasonably priced at $26 but the signature wines seemed a bit over priced at $50 to $65. The tasting room was quite busy, but they had enough staff and space that we didn't feel neglected or cramped.
Also had lunch at the restaurant (separate review) which I would recommend.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>we had a great time . All the staff were  top notch.  The only problem is the change of stageing, it was very uncomfortable standing in the parking lot ,then led through what appeared to  be  a maintenance area around back.        The old venue was much more comfortable. Still a wonderful time . Just a bit awkward from previous visits.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80ed29f7f823a82d:0xb550b7414f39c66d<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Love love me some Justin! I didn’t drink until I tried Ontuse. My  hairdressers serves it up all of the time. He  was serving up some one day and I had a sip.  I’m now a wine-o...Been hooked ever since. Obtuse is to die for and they are always sold out. We are members of their wine club and  considering an upgrade!

<Review>Always been a big fan of the isosceles, but the quality has gone down. The restaurant next to the tasting area takes away the charm that it once had. To make it worse, the Wonderful Company purchased them and recently cleared 100 acres of oak trees so they can plant more grapes.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Really liked the 2013 Isosceles and the 2013 Savant from the tasting menu. Beautiful contemporary setting in the Tasting room. For driving enthusiasts, the drive to this vineyard is a lot of fun.

<rate>4<//rate><Review>The restaurant is very nice, has a view of the vineyard and is covered and heated. My burger was delicious, maybe a little less pink than I would have liked but amazing none the less. The fries, which come in a sharable order are also great. Maybe it was the day we visited but they were missing isosceles and the cab sauv(which are my two favorite) from the tasting room. The wine was good but sort of missing the umph that you expect.< /Review>< pics>

Awesome winery to visit and have a tasting.  A bit out of the way, but worth it.  I also highly recommend staying at the Just Inn (on property rooms) overnight if you have the opportunity.</Review>

This is by far my favorite wine and absolute favorite winery to visit. We've visited and stayed at the JustInn twice now and had the best experience both times. I will go back for the third time!!</Text>

Don't waste your time driving to this sterile and stuffy over rated corporate office building. Over-rated. There is nothing inviting about this place at all. Everyone from the greeter to the manager acted like a snob. It was a Friday afternoon, almost nobody there and they made us wait 15 minutes before we could have the privilege of standing in front of their so-called wine expert. The wine was so so. Don't bother !<//Text>

Passible but overpriced wine mixed with haughty staff equals a sub-par experience overall. Nice view from the back porch and a decent charcuterie plate, but not enough to ever entice me back when there were so many better Passo wineries on the way up there.</Text>

<review>Way overcrowded and over-commercial. I felt like we were standing in a gift shop. Our overworked server was sweet but hurried, and was unimpressed with the wines. Also owned by the least ethical water company in the world, Fiji.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80ed29f7f823a82d:0xb550b7414f39c66d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

JUSTIN Vineyards and Winery is a beautiful place to stop for wine tasting, lunch, and a winery tour. The tasting room and restaurant stands out like a contemporary ranch house amongst the surrounding vineyards. Row upon row of vines stretch across the land and hills like fine stitch work. If you decide to stay for lunch, here are a few suggestions from the menu:

A great way to try the wines while enjoying a meal is with a flight. The White Wine Flight includes 2014 JUSTIN Sauvignon Blanc, 2014 JUSTIN Rosé, and 2013 Landmark Overlook Chardonnay. The Sauvignon Blanc has a pear nose. Green apple and peach flavors are experienced on the palate with a light, clean finish. Rating: 3.5/5. The Rosé has a blackberry and cherry aroma. Strawberry and grapefruit flavors are experienced on the palate with a nice, clean finish. Rating: 4.5/5. The Chardonnay has a white grape and pear aroma. White grape, pear, floral, and mineral flavors experienced on the palate. Rating: 2.5/5

Windrose Farm Lamb Tartare is topped with garden greens, preserved lemon aioli, and crostini. This was a fantastic take on tartare. The lamb was sweet and minced perfectly. The use of shaved egg yolk added a richness to the dish without the mess of a runny egg yolk. The fresh greens from the garden paired nicely. Rating: 4.5/5

JUSTIN Fries are tossed with truffle salt, parmesan, and JUSTIN fine herb blend. The fries were light and crispy. The truffle flavor was just right so the parmesan and herbs could shine as well. Rating: 4.5/5

Bucatini Pasta tossed with Alle-Pia sausage, wild mushrooms, bitter greens, smoked butter, and parmesan. This was an excellence lunch dish, light yet satisfying. The sauce had a rich creamy texture. The flavors of the succulent mushrooms and lean, meaty sausage balanced perfectly with the sauce and pasta. Rating: 4.5/5

JUSTIN Brownies topped with caramel, cocoa nibs, and served with lemon balm ice cream. The brownie was served warm with rich, decadent chocolate flavor. Caramel sauce made the dish more luxurious. The lemon balm ice cream was refreshing with unexpected herbal notes. It was different and made a nice contrast to the brownie. Rating: 3.8/5

After lunch, a walking tour is a great way to burn some calories. JUSTIN Vineyards and Winery offers tours of their facility. Be sure to call ahead for a reservation as the tours are limited to 10 people per tour. Our tour guide, Larry, took us around the winery, showing us the machinery used to mill and press the grapes during harvest and the large stainless steel tanks used for the fermentation process. He then walked us through the caves where the different wines are aged in French Oak barrels. You will also be tasting wine along the way - Rosé, Merlot, Petit Syrah, and Reserve. You'll also notice that scattered around the vineyard are poles with metal boxes on top. They sort of look like large bird houses. They are homes for the owls who rid the vineyards of rodents and snakes. They let nature take on the job of pest control so chemical pesticides are not used.

After the tour, head back to the tasting room to sample and purchase your favorite wines. Take a walk around the on-site vegetable garden where they grow the produce that is ultimately going to end up on your plate in the restaurant - kale, different varieties of lettuce, edible flowers, Swiss chard, and more. Lady bugs and praying mantis are also natural pest controllers and are on patrol here as well.<//Text>

<text>Beautiful decor, decently friendly people but that was about it. It felt very clinical while the other wineries felt much more inviting.

(Extra star for the food which was delicious)<//text></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Honestly, I found the cost of the tasting menu of only 5 wines excessive, in fact the price was 25 dollars. Basically two and a half dollars a sip.
The place is particularly beautiful relaxing well maintained and located between 12 and 15 miles from the center of Paso Robles.
The locality is surrounded by Vigne is a small garden of aromatic herbs and Olives.
inside, as well as wine tastings, themed accessories and flavored oils are also offered.
The wines are certainly of quality, but not such as to justify the price paid.
In the city center Justin offers a small secondary center for tasting their wines.
The outdoor veranda is interesting, surrounded by aromatic plants, on several levels, which offers small corners where you can have lunch or dinner in the more reserved areas.

(Original)
Sinceramente ho trovato eccessivo il costo del menu di assaggio di soli 5 vini, il prezzo infatti era di 25 dollari. Praticamente due dollari e mezzo a sorso.
Il luogo è particolarmente bello rilassante ben curato e distante tra le 12 e le 15 miglia dal centro di Paso Robles.
La località è circondata da Vigne è un piccolo orto di erbe aromatiche e Olivi.
all'interno vengono offerte oltre che assaggi dei vini anche accessori a tema e oli aromatizzati.
I vini sono sicuramente di qualità, ma non tali da giustificare il prezzo pagato.
Nel centro città Justin offre un piccolo secondario centro per l'assaggio dei loro vini.
Interessante la veranda esterna, circondata da piante aromatiche, su più livelli, che offre piccoli angoli dove poter pranzare o cenare nella penombra zone più riservate.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxZp_wBodOlfqHgEERXHvn33I1ZyujjZkscmdG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHWjLKeSQ8RjsEBpfjd6MFlz_UViMpGycaH26h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYM5o9b__tX1G61veXUAvE52Az5O1AMY5_a5S0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXYbLflPmkgot239Smg19NXT7TnGQpPGhqgcIY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOS46BN0xbKuruNAK2G6btiKtrKpa6RvNoccX4U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) A beauty of vineyards in the mountains are the background of the restaurant where you can taste the wine of your choice -white, pink or red-, accompanied by a delicious table of cheeses, hams, jams and olives, among other delicacies
