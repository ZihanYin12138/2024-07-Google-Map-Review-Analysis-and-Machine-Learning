< Review>
Favorite Mexican eatery period and pretty excited to finally be able to eat inside again. Reasonable prices, generous portions and the most outstanding feature: everything is homemade there in the restaurant from the chorizo to the corn tortillas and heavenly horchata. You can taste the quality! Taco connoisseurs must visit Don Zarape #2 for what I guarantee will be some of the best tacos you'll ever eat. Space between alternating tables to encourage social distancing and if you order to go, please wait outside where seating is also available.< /Review>

<Review>Hungover?
Need Pozole or Menudo? Is it Saturday or Sunday? This place has it all. My friend and I needed Pozole ASAP after friday nights craziness. It hit the spot, delicious.
If you don't like the pigs foot I suggest you tell the lady. They don't put a bunch of maiz and theres plenty of meat.
House made torillas and they have the classic huge grill, grilling chicken outside. You can smell it a couple blocks down.
The only downside about this place is, THEY TAKE FOREVER! buttttt it's worth it in the end.
Service: The ladies are very nice and attentive.
Ambiance: Classic mexican restaurant decor with TVs</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Another tasty Mexican spot in my neighborhood!

The mole was a tad on the sweet side, but better than most places I've tried. The chicken was moist. Great salsa with the chips. Friendly service.

The beans weren't great, though, and that's one of the main things I look for at a Mexican joint.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c295ed2a1007bb:0x8bfbd7aaa20776d1<//gmap_id></record>

< Review>
I wanted authentic so bad and this wasn't it. I haven't been here in years and was excited to eat but was truly disappointed. This was a white-washed version of Mexican food with no depth of flavor to be found.  The food was not hot and the orders were mixed up as well. Chefs day off perhaps?<//Review>

Good authentic food I heard bad reviews about the service. I had a great experience, but me and my boyfriend were the only ones there. The tortillas are freshly made. Over all I loved it. Hard to find a good place for Mexican food. I'm rather picky.</Text>

A great favourite of mine.  You can drive down vineland and see them out grilling daily.  They even do whole chickens for sale, fresh and well seasoned.  This is the No. 2 location, thank you Ms. Zarape.< /Review>

<review>This is a  little Mexican food place that has been in this area for years and years. They also have a second location. This is the one I go to the most. This place is... Okay.  The food is pretty traditional. It's very straight to the point Mexican fare. Which is not at all a bad thing. The issue I have here is the consistency of the food. It sometimes is outstanding, it sometimes isn't. I guess you can say that about tons of restaurants though... The prices are also a bit steep.  However! They do have a fantastic perk. They have a enormous barbecue in which they use to grill chickens. SO. MANY. CHICKENS. And those are really good. I go there to eat the chicken. Just the chicken. That to me, is the only consistently good thing about this place. Order yourself a half or a whole chicken, get a cup of their nice spicy salsa, grab a Coke, and you're set. You don't need anything else.< /review></record>

Very friendly staff, democratic prices and above all, great selection of very tasty authentic food. They also have amazing charcoal-grilled chicken and chorizo, which I always get. Make sure you order that before 4pm on weekdays and before 8pm on weekends, as they tend to run out pretty quick.<//review>< Pictures>

We had the horchata which was fantastic. The tea, was not brewed. The food tasted very fresh and the waitress was very accommodating. We enjoyed our meal and experience. The chips and salsa was great. Chips were just made and salsa was spicy. Mucho Bueno!< /Text>

They are not consistent with the taco size.They have the small taco and the big taco but when you order the big tacos on Sunday they are the size of the small tacos. They cheat you on the meat. I also ordered a Carne Asada Borito and it was mainly all rice, Again they cheat you on the meat. When I told the lady who charged me for the taco about the size and that it was small she told me that's the taco they gave you. How rude. I was really craving a big taco thats reoson why I went there. I was upset and was thinking twice about eating the taco because when food enters your system and gets into your blood it could be bad for your health. Dont eat food when your mad or upset, but the costumer service and lack of understanding really disturbe me.I Should of gone to Subway and gotten a 5 dollar sub then to spend 11 dollars and some change on some side orders in a tortilla.

it's Jan 1 and I did not drink last night.  I just needed some soup for my cold.  I've been eating Menudo all my life and today I enjoyed the best bowl of Menudo I'VE EVER HAD, EVER !!
Thank you for substituting extra meat in place of pig's feet and not trying to charge me for it.  La Fogata wanted to charge me.
Also, since coming here two years, your servers are always genuinely interested.<//Review>

< review>
Gastronomic ecstasy!  Been eating here for several years, try the large carnitas tacos, made with thick homemade corn tortillas - delicious!   The homemade juice and the chorizo plate is also very good, my favorite Mexican fast food local to Toluca Lake.  On weekends they cook next to the full size horse statues on a large wood fired grill in the parking lot with lots of chorizo, pork, chicken, and more.</review>

< review>
The food is fairly good the place is big enough to sit comfortable you can't really have a conversation due to the fact that the music is too loud, The place is clean and the servings are big enough to match the price, The service is not the friendliest otherwise it would have more appeal and the price could be lower due to the fact that they don't due table waiting.</review>

I live 75 miles away.
Today I am back with two id’s. I had a young man helping me and the manager told him to stop and cashier, I tried to speak to him but he shut me down. I have been now waiting for 1/2 an hour with someone in line also waiting for fingerprints. I didn’t mind waiting, The rudeness was very upsetting. Manager

< Review>
I so wanted to give 5 stars for the excellent service and troubleshooting I got from the general manager of the store for the old computer my husband desperately needed.

She was wonderful! And the purchase of our new computer came in right on time to our front door.

But when I had technical support transfer his photos to the new computer it all seemed to go well but I had difficulty picking it up because the tech was busy in the copy department. I waited for a very long time only to find that the computer was acting up. So I left for 45 minutes then came back, and waited another 25 minutes to have someone released the computer to me.

Ironically, the manager wasn't there that day and it didn't go as smooth as previously. But I highly recommend Office Max for their tech support and care for the needs of their customer.</Review>

Found everything I needed.  Quick in & out. Only drawback is there were very few "knowledgeable" staff to help. He had to go back into the backroom for help with questions I had.<//Review>

<user_name>Cameron Mark McIntyre<//user_name><Rate>5< /Rate><text>Well, it is your typical Office Superstore... What did surprise me was finding a home telephone for less than one of the bargain superstores. Their prices are not always competitive, but they do have EVERYTHING office. So from pens and pencils to scotch tape and reams of paper by the cases... They got it...  What for their sales; they will surprise you. And their staff (when you can find them) are always helpful.<//text><time>1488447250710<//time>< user>

Quick and easy place to get copies. Some of their prices are a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale.<//review>

< Review>
I work in the office of a local charter school. We needed a competent company to print and bind 15 copies of our WASC Self Study- a 170 page mix of color and b&w pages. Every person who assisted us with this went out of their way to guarantee the quality of our final product. When a billing issue came up they sat with me and re-entered the product so I can get my ecommerce discount and use a purchase order for this transaction. They did this extra work with a smile and did not make me feel like the inconvenience (that I was). Their outstanding customer service was refreshing and my product was beautiful!!
I did remove one star because my product was not completed by the date I was quoted when I dropped off.<//Review>

We found this place by accident. My sister and I called to ask how long the wait time was and they said 30 minutes. We were seated as soon  as we arrived. The service was phenomenal! The place is a bit tiny but perfect to spend a nice dinner date at. They have two prices, the silver $25 and the gold (forgot the price) for all you can eat. The only issue we had was my sister found a hair in her rice. The staff was quick and apologized. The experience was wonderful,  if you ever find yourself in that area please visit!</review>

Came here on a Saturday night after seeing other KKBQs with 3 hour lines. No line, was suspicious. But after eating, I am more than satisfied by quality and service. Everything and anything you could want in a KBBQ. Good meat, good seating, good sides, good service. I loved it<//review>

<GmapID>0x80c2b882b5222d0b:0x2ff023586660adb8</GmapID><text>One of my favorite K BBQ spots. The staff is the friendliest you will meet and will make you feel like you’re having a big meal with family. The cuts were thicker than at a lot of other places and te marinades were flavorful, if a little on the sweet side. The bon chon was plentiful and honestly was only slightly more in price than some of the all you can eat spots. We got the medium combo for two but would have been fine with a small.</text>< rate>

Good and fast service. Nice japchae and steam egg side dishes.
The marinated beef rib, brisket and shrimp were great.
Would recommend!!</text>

After a few attempts at other Korean BBQ restaurants on a Saturday night at 8, Yang San Bak was the only one that didn't require a wait. I guess that couldn't have been a good sign.

Three hangry friends and I went with the Combo C (for 3-4 people). For $64.99, you get brisket, rib belly, marinated beef, steak, and a bottle of soju. Between this and all of the banchan dishes, we were stuffed. It was more than enough food. The flavor of the meats and the side dishes were good overall, but some of the cuts were a bit chewy.

Service was lacking. I'm not sure if it's a Yang San Bak thing, or an LA KBBQ thing, but in NYC KBBQ spots, they help you cut up the meats, grill them, switch out your grill plate, and refill your banchan dishes. None of that happened here. We were left to handle our own meats, like peasants. And sadly, our empty banchan dishes went unfilled (waiters were nowhere to be found). I looked over at the couple next to us, and their grill was completely burnt, so it wasn't just our table.

I think next time, I'll get a snack to hold me over and wait it out at the better KBBQ restaurants.</text>

<Review>Overall one of the better Korean BBQ I’ve had. My only gripe is the gristle in some of the beef which makes me question the quality of the cut.

Other than that, the food and service were excellent. My server was very attentive and helpful.

I cannot really judge the service all too much as I was literally the only customer in the restaurant the entire time of my visit. Perhaps the lack of other customers is why the vibe was not quite right.

Knocked a star for the gristle. I have never experienced that in all my years eating Korean BBQ.< /Review>< pictures>

However, what isn't typical, is the fact the place itself is fairly quiet. Club music isn't blaring at 96db. You can ACTUALLY talk to the person across the table in a normal voice. If you, or someone you know has a hearing aid and love KBBQ, please go to Yang San Bak.

The Food: High quality meats and delicious sides. So let's be honest, it doesn't have the best meat, but it does have great meat at a great price. It also has one of dipping sauces ever. Seriously, that red chili sauce is amazing.

The Price: This has one of the best quality to price ratios for a KBBQ place in Koreatown. And their combo/meal includes an alcoholic drink. So this makes the place even more reasonable if you drink but hate having to pay $12 for a bottle of soju.

What I Would Change: So this place isn't as hip or trendy as the other places in KTown. But this has become one of the best overall KBBQ places to go. It isn't as busy or packed as other KBBQ places in the area. It does make me worry if they're making enough business (given the rising rents). But then again, I like that we can go at 7PM and not have to wait until 8PM to finally be seated. So maybe I don't want anything to change about this place.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Stopped by this place after a course of cocktails across the street and man am I glad I went in. I haven't had Korean BBQ for a very long time, but eating here brought me back to the days I lived in Japan and had it every couple weeks. A low key place with matching low-key, but very friendly and helpful staff. Good food, I would definitely recommend it.<//Review>

We checked into our hotel after 9:30 pm on a Friday night and were dying for some good Korean food.  This was one of the few places open late, with decent reviews and happened to be right across the street from our hotel. We ordered the combo A; it was plenty of food for two. Good quality, loved that it was open late.</Review>

We had 3 adults and a child. Ordered medium sized mixed bbq plate. ($75) also came with a drink (large beer to share or soju). I wasn’t sure it was going to be enough food since I eat a decent amount but it was.
Also ordered cold buckwheat noodles for additional $10 for large and $7 for a small.
All the food was amazing and the service was great too.
Definitely will be back if I’m the area.</text>

<Text>i love this place. the food is high quality and you get a free hite or soju. its worth the extra price. the place is very cozy and has a great vibe when its full, everyones loud and full of life. the staff is great too, same two guys have been here for a while and even remembered me after not coming for 4 months. the manager is a cool guy to, he really cares about this restaurant and its customers.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Good quality food with decent pricing. The service is very Asian, speak up if you want anything or else you'll be ignored. We ordered a 2-3 person set, brisket, pork belly, rib fingers and bulgogi. It comes with an alcoholic drink, soju or beer. You also get a steamed egg a person and a variety of ban chans. It was a good thing I read a few reviews before going and ordered rice. You can get the rice and pour if into the moat of kimchee and make fried rice with it. The grill is a bit small so be prepared to wait a bit. Overall, I enjoyed it and will go back in the future. There wasn't a wait like some of the newer, more hip kbbq places.< /review>< Pictures>

I am independent of the owner, and I am just 16 years old.

I called Wizard Plumbing to clear a poorly draining bathroom sink, and as a precaution run the rotor rooter through the sewer pipe.  The person who answered the phone refused to give a quote.  A plumber came, cleared the sink drain and ran the rotor rooter through the sewer pipe.  He spent about 45 min on the job and charged $ 575.  He would not give me an invoice but promised one by email.  None came.  I called Wizard and again requested an invoice.  None came.

The $ 575 charge for 45 min on the job was outrageous.  Failure to send an invoice is an unacceptable business practice.

Beware!

I’ve lived in a house that was built in 1947 for 10 years. So I’ve had more than a few plumbers come through for various issues during that time. A termite inspector found a leak, so I panic-called the first result on Yelp (I don’t usually do that). Wizard Plumbing came through, assessed the situation, and gave me a number of options, each with associated costs. Not one to mess around with plumbing, I went with the most extensive & labor intensive option (and I’m glad I did; see pix). Out of all the plumbers I’ve done business with over the years, Wizard Plumbing proved to be — by far — the most honest, fair, competent, experienced and thorough. In fact, if I made a Venn diagram with all of those attributes for each of the plumbers I’ve done business with, Wizard would be the only one that made a perfect circle. They’ve definitely made a customer for life.</review>

Everyone at Wizard are very polite, professional, and understanding of what the customer needs. Felt very comfortable having them replace my faucet, and they did it for a very very good price. I will call them again when I redo the pipes under my house.</Review>

<Text>Wizard is my go-to plumber for any job around the house.  Has been the first plumbing company I call when I have a problem, since 2012 personally.  Despite my extensive reviewing, I'm generally cautious about endorsing home service companies because we all know that our customer experience can vary so much each time, depending on who they send and how well their skills fit the particular problem.  But here I am, having had Rafael from Wizard just replace my broken water heater.  I am writing a review and Google asks me to catalogue the various tasks they've done for my family over the years.  I find it surprisingly extensive.  Water heater died, kitchen faucet leak, garbage disposal failure, wobbly toilets, clogged drains.  Each time a different visit, and each time I'd called Wizard for the job.  Because each and every time since the first, I had a good customer experience in what was otherwise a bad day.  Each time their people were good or great, and each time the problem was fixed for what I soberly reckoned as a fair price.

Nobody likes to have to call a plumber.  But when I have to, I've never regretted calling Wizard.  What more could you want from a plumber?< /Text>< Pictures>

We had a leaky pipe under the kitchen sink. We called late afternoon and we able to get an appointment for the next day. He was quickly able to assess the problem, had the parts to fix it, and took care of it right away. Everything about the communication and service was amazing. We will definitely use them again for our plumbing needs.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>My water heater died on a weekend and Wizard was the first plumber to take my call on a Sunday. Miguel came out on time; quickly assessed that a new water heater was needed. Wizard had the forethought to know to bring a new water heater just in case since it was a long distance. I also didn’t get charged extra for weekend service like other plumbers would have. Miguel was professional and careful to not damage my floors since water heater was located inside the house. He also fixed some piping and didn’t charge extra like other plumbers would have. Overall, very happy with service. I would recommend Wizard plumbing and use them again in a heartbeat.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808f9ef96934005d:0x7fa8b9f2ad184495< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've used Wizard on several occasions for urgent plumbing repair.  Quality of workmanship seems excellent.  However, pricing seems at the high end of the spectrum.  If your need isn't urgent, suggest getting a comparison price from another plumber.< /text>

We had senior tech Greg Dolling here to take care of our water heater issues. His expertise in his trade is obvious and reassuring. So wonderful to find a plumbing company that we can rely on now and in the future and a plumber that cares. Greg’s positive attitude and sense of humor is infectious. Thanks for everything!!

I've used Wizard Plumbing several times now and called Wizard Plumbing to replace a water heater that was leaking in our complex this time.  Rafael Solis, the technician who did the job was able to come almost immediately and replaced a water heater for us.  He did an excellent job and we appreciated how prompt, efficient, and professional he was.  Thanks again Wizard Plumbing!< /review>

< Review>
Had an urgent need for plumbing services in the early evening. Toilet gurgling and then back up in both the bathtub and a shower stall. Water overflowed from shower into the bedroom. I searched Yelp and Nextdoor for recommendations and found Wizard! The responses I received when I called were helpful professional and caring. My desperation was surely evident.
Jay arrived at the house within 30 minutes!  He quickly addressed the issue, offered recommended solutions and even referred me to a restoration company for possible water damage!  Jay came back as promised the next day to further diagnose the issue. Wizard came to my rescue and really hit the mark for excellent service.
5 star in my book!!</Review>

Last week they fixed a pipe under the sink in the bathroom that had rotted and been broken by a handyman by accident, necessitating our shutting off of water. In each case Mo was our lead plumber. He is professional, knowledgeable, and I trust him to evaluate the situation and give me an honest appraisal, and offer options. It was a delicate job, and he suggested we might wish to contact a contractor. But we asked him to attempt the repair which he did beautifully,  and saved us a lot of money.  I recommend Wizard highly. Also their operators/customer service people are professional and helpful. I can't recommend them highly enough.</Text>< Pics>

Rafael was really good. He tried to fix the flush valve in our toilet that was making vibrating noises when it’s flushed (scared all of us in the beginning!).  He ended up having to replace the entire toilet. He also fixed one of the faucets that was leaking.  Problem solved! Thank you Rafael!!!<//review>

I had a great experience with Wizard plumbing. It was really easy to work with their staff over the phone to get the work booked, and Manny and Israel did an incredible job once on site. The job was hard (read: gross), but they were incredibly professional, worked efficiently, and communicated well throughout the process. I'm definitely calling them next time I need a plumber, 100%.<//review>

Amazing plumber. I had a backed up drain (I’ll spare the details), Mo and his assistant arrived two hours after I called. Followed COVID safety protocols and laid everything out before starting to work. They had everything back to normal within an hour. They were both extremely professional and thorough. Even cleaned everything up. Will definitely use Wizard Plumbing in the future without hesitation.<//Review>

I had a bunch of problems: the bath was leaking, the toilet was leaking and I had a problem with one of the taps. Gregg D did a great job. He was happy to explain what he was doing as he was doing it. I could tell that he took pride in doing a job well done too and that he was being thorough.< /Review>

<text>My water heater was not working and a neighbor recommended I call Wizard Plumbing. A supervisor named Danny was able to fix the same day I called - on a Saturday no less! He was prompt, professional and very friendly.

I will definitely be using Wizard Plumbing again for any plumbing needs I have.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808f9ef96934005d:0x7fa8b9f2ad184495<//gmap_id></record>

Rafael was on time, let us know what the cost would be up front, fixed the clogged sink quickly and was super friendly. Is there anything more you need in a plumber???<//text>

<Review>Great work as always! Responsive and efficient. We had our water heater replaced several years back.
This time, our Sloan flushmate compatible toilet installed more than 20 years ago was found to be internally leaking with a small hole In the pressure tank. Coordinated with Gregg D. at Wizard who specializes in these systems to replace the old system with the one Sloan sent out that was covered in a lifetime warranty once I knew the delivery date. I was notified by UPS that the part would arrive on Thursday, told Wizard about that and setup the repair date for Friday. Gregg had come over previously to give an estimate and then returned on the following Friday as scheduled and under estimate. Toilet works great again.
Thanks to Wizard for friendly and reliable service at a reasonable price.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x808f9ef96934005d:0x7fa8b9f2ad184495</Gmap_id><username>John Feng<//username></record></dataset><record>

<review>The plumber supposedly fixed the sink leak. The sink is leaking again. I asked him to figure out a way to have the old toilet use less water so he adjusted the amount of water. These two services cost $225. He had to come back out to readjust the toilet as it would no longer flush the solids. He put it back to what it was before. I am out $140 for nothing changed. Furthermore, he went under our house and checked out our pipes and claimed they needed to be replaced (our house is old). They do not. He tried to scare us into spending thousands of dollars on an unnecessary fix, not to mention charging $225 for 'fixes' that did not work. Do not call this place. I have left messages for the supervisor and have not gotten any of the issues resolved.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Today 5/13/2020 - This was the best service by far for clearing my lateral drain and I’ve had this done by various plumbers at least 5 other times in the past dozen years.  I’m not sure how I missed their high ratings before.  The great service I received seems typical.  From beginning to end, they impressed.  After leaving a voicemail for another plumber yesterday that was referred to me, I had no return call for nearly 24 hours (still no return call after 30 hours).  So I called Wizard based on the great reviews.  A live person answered the phone, said someone would come out within 2 hours, the plumber showed up in under an hour.  Very professional, informative and good communicator.  He said the work would be a flat fee which was a little more than half of what I have paid before.  Did the work quickly and showed me where my drain pipe was broken.  I asked for estimates on repair and he quickly gave me 2 reasonable quotes based on different levels of repair.  Outstanding service at a great price!< /review>

Greg installed our water filter. Great guy, efficient and did an excellent job installing our Aquasana water filter under the sink. We recently moved to San Carlos and we are so grateful to find a plumber that we can trust. Will definitely be calling for Greg to come back out to our house in the future. THANK YOU!</text>

We knew it was blown.Yet Gregg showed up and went through all the motions. Confirmed what I knew.  Made it by an hour to the place they buy them from. Well done. Even had a partner come by and help him lift the old and install the new. Fair price and certainly great service.</Text>

I called Wizard Plumbing after our horribly clogged bathtubs started backing up with sewage. Not only did Mike and Sam fix the issue, they took the time to show me the various pipes under the house and explain what was going on with them. As if that wasn't enough, they then cleaned the sewage out of the bathtub, which truly made my day. HIGHLY recommended!</Review>

Mike and Sam from Wizard Plumbing came by to replace the wax seal at the base of the toilet. Rarely would a visit from a plumber be worth a review, but these guys were really fantastic. Professional, quick, kind, friendly - they were really awesome. Recommend to absolutely everyone< /text>

<Review>Amazing! My husband called for an estimate and within an hour someone was here. They would have installed a new toilet the same day but Home Depot required a two hour notice to pick up the toilet. 🙄 But they did it the next day and took less than an hour. And didn't even leave a mess. They were not noisy at all, I have a newborn and was able to put baby to sleep without any problem while they worked in the bathroom next to the bedroom. Highly recommend this company!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

Miguel replaced drain pipes for two bathrooms, a kitchen, and installed a trap for my washing machine. This was a 73 year old house and drainage was blocked up. He was courteous, professional, and got the job done. It was a tough job being in the crawl space all day sawing off iron pipes and replacing them with PVC.< /review>

First thing, I want give Manny a shout out, because he was wonderful!! He came in to install our faucet and ended up helping us with so many things! He discovered why our dishwasher has been leaking (which is huge because we ended up not using it for over a year). We now have a functioning dishwasher that is safe with an “air gap” that was installed. Our faucet was in terrible shape and he was able to take it out and install the new one in a very short time. Best of all, he was happy to share his knowledge and answer all of my questions. We are so thrilled with the results, Manny is the man!</Review>

Gregg installed a MeetFLO meter and shutoff and performed tankless water heater de-scaling service.  Great work!  Both the estimate and work appointment were on-time.  Estimate beat my other quote and completed work matched the estimate.  Gregg followed COVID safety protocol.  Would recommend!< /Review>

Franco was great. They were running late so they called me to adjust the window and work with my schedule.  I had a low flow issue with hot water and I had cleaned and descaled the cartridge and shower heads but still had issues.  Franco took a look at the work and cleaned the mixing valve and didn’t charge me. I would use them with eyes closed anytime I need them in the future. Thank you for a great service.<//Text>

They have send another couple to fix and it looks that as we use the grinder, it is moving down. Their response is very fast and I like that.

-----------

I have had sink clogged so asked them to come to fix it.

The clogging is fixed but then the garbage disposal was broken by them. They say the pipe is too old. They fixed that as well, asking for $500+.

One month later, the garbage disposal seems broken again and leaking water very badly.

I will wait to see how it is going to be fixed.<//Text>< pics>

I called Wizard and to my surprise a real person answered the phone-earned a quick point for that. The gal that answered the phone was pleasant and efficient quickly getting my information and understanding my needs. An appointment was made, with a follow up text confirming the appointment. An additional text followed letting me the technician was on the way. This text included a photo of the tech which I felt great about being that I am home alone most of the time.

Both technicians came neatly dressed and were professional and courteous. The were super efficient and kept the work space clean. I would highly recommend Wizard and if I have needs in the future, I will definitely call them again.

<Text>What a nice group of people. Very courteous and knowledgeable. Like most houses around here we have Orangeburg pipes which are doomed to fail. Wizard came immediately, assessed the  damage, and got to work. Sadly, it turned out to be a lot more work than expected so the price increased considerable from the initial estimate. It has been worked out. Will definitely recommend.<//Text>< user_id>

Christian and Israel were awesome. Called them in the morning to get leaky hot water tank replaced and they arrived by noon, with the replacement tank and had everything done in just about an hour. Very professional, told me everything I needed to know about the new tank and made sure they checked for any leaks before they left.

I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a plumber.</review>

They walked us through our needs vs. nice to haves and did not try to tell us they all fell under the same bucket. They did a nice job and we're glad we chose them. Very efficient and personable, which is rare to find.</review>< gmapID>

<date>1578548171081<//date><Rate>1<//Rate><text>I asked Wizard for an estimate to replace some piping underneath a downstairs bathroom, and to remount an existing toilet.  Their rep quoted the work as taking about 2 hours, and costing $1,500.  Even if you used a crazy-high hourly plumber's rate of $200/hour, that's only $400 in labor.  Add $100-$200 for parts (just a few feet of ABS piping and fittings), and I thought the job would be in the $500-$600 range.  $1,500 feels like a company that's trying to take advantage of any customer who doesn't know better.  I'm getting other quotes, and so far none are above $1,000.  I won't be using Wizard.< /text>< pictures>

when PG&E turns the gas off because of a hazardous situation, you want an expert to come right away, take a look and not only knows what needs to be done but also gets started right away and while checking the system also finds other leaks, fixes everything, warps up cleans everything and is finished in no time.

It's always amazing when things go exactly as expected when the unexpected happens and you're suddenly in the cold.

Manny and Isaac did a great job fixing the gas line in no time and testing it.</text>

Steve arrived within the promised time frame and quickly identified the issue. He explained what was wrong and what the fix was. Start to finish it took less than 30 min. Steve was awesome!

The service was more than good, it was great at a price. One plumber came to see the problem of the water heater and suggested to replace it. My wife at home alone just wanted the problem fixed and agreed to the estimation.  Another plumber joined and bring in the new water heater. Totally, from 7 PM to 9 PM, the job was done. The new 40 gallon water heater is about $700 in stores. The bill was at $1975. Yes, it is great service as long as you feel like to pay the high labor cost. To me, next time, I'll think again because it takes me many days of work to cover the high labor cost.<//review>

We had leak caused by some badly fitting pipes under our kitchen sink. I called Wizard pretty late, and they sent someone out first thing the next morning. They fixed the pipes very quickly, and with a far superior quality than the original pipes and the pricing was very fair. 10/10 would use their service again.</Review>

<review>Francisco and his partner did an awesome job at fixing a drain clog we had on both shower and toilet. They were prompt, professional and offered competitive pricing. They also made some great recommendations to prevent future clogs.
Definitely would use in the future if needed.< /review><gmap_id>0x808f9ef96934005d:0x7fa8b9f2ad184495< /gmap_id>< user_id>

My kitchen faucet was dripping slowly, but quickly got much worse.  I called Wizard plumbing as they repaired a bathroom faucet last year and I'd had a great experience with them.  I placed the call about 3pm and had 2 technicians at my door by 4pm.  Franco quickly diagnosed the problem and gave me an estimate.  Less than an hour later, my faucet was working perfectly and the kitchen was tidy.  At no additional charge, Franco and his assistant even installed the soap dispenser that I had planned to fix myself.  I will definitely call Wizard the next time I have a plumbing issue!<//text>

< Review>
I was referred to Wizard Plumbing and Drain by trusted local contractors in other fields.  Wizard came up from each and every one.  My expectations were high.

The service I got from Josue and Miguel in exploring my problems today was all I hoped and more.  They hung in with me for a long list of questions.  They explored my project exceptionally diligently to define the best possible solution(s) in a very complicated (and uncomfortable in a crawl space!) situation.  They left no stone unturned in defining the best possible fix.  Their *can-do* approach was comforting and reassuring when faced with a very difficult job.  They left me with a thumb drive video so that I can explain all we found with my whole family.  And, they promised that they would be back, themselves, with the crew to do the actual (ugly) job.

I am a 45 year Realtor.  I have worked with many plumbers on many, many homeowners' issues over the years.  I have never had or witnessed better help from anyone, ever.</Review>

<date>1577212028382< /date><Review>Called Wizard yesterday to have a kitchen sink drain unclogged, and to get that chronic problem fixed once and for all.  Christian came within an hour, diagnosed the problem correctly (unlike a number of prior plumbers/rooters), and fixed it within 3 hours, including time to get parts.  The price was high (drawn from a price table in their system), but I was desperate.  Christian was very pleasant and conscientious, and I am very happy with the job he did.</Review>< Name>

They did a great job installing our reverse osmosis water filter under our kitchen sink and did a few minor repairs around the house. They also flushed our tankless water heater, though the unit’s outdoor plug somehow failed a few days after, which generated an electrician  call. Could be coincidence, however. I would recommend them far above another well known outfit, which created a sham estimate!<//review>

I had a dreadful emergency situation with pipes breaking under my house.  It flooded the crawlspace, and everything from my home was draining under the house.  Wizard came out within an hour, and repaired the problem.  They also did a massive clean up and deodorizing as well.  I've used them a few times before for random plumbing issues, and their service is always prompt, and they complete the job with no future issues.  I highly recommend them.<//Text>

<Text>Called Wizard after my remodel subcontractor says I had some issues with my pipes not related to the new remodel. Wanted to charge $325 for a camera inspection. I called Wizard as I used them before for a kitchen clog. They looked at the piping and used a camera to inspect my sewer line to the main line and did not find any issues. They looked at the new piping from the subcontractor and gave some recommendations what might be the issue. Recommended I contact back the contractor and not pay to fix it myself. They spent almost an hour looking over everything and left without charging me anything as there were no clogs in the sewer lines. They are honest and truthful and do not try to drum up business! Highly recommended for any plumbing needs or issues!<//Text><time>1566364092563</time>< Gmap_id>

Steve was very courteous, knowledgeable and helpful. He came out to check on some plumbing issue we were concerned about and he made a small repair without even charging us for it.
We have used Wizard twice so far, once to replace our water heater when it burst on a Sunday night. They did a great job and were very reasonable.
Highly recommend these guys!!!< /review>

Wizard Plumbing has done multiple large jobs for me over the past 5-6 years for two different houses - everything from a major replacement of plumbing under the house to resolving a very complex drainage problem in the backyard.   They are very professional, experienced, honest, and very nice to work with.  I've been exceptionally pleased with all of their work and that's why I've continued to use them.  I've also recommended Wizard to some friends and they have been delighted with their work.< /Text>

<review>While I agree that Wizard Plumbing does a great job for kitchens and bathroom plumbing, I had THE WORST EXPERIENCE with them when they installed a trenchless sewer pipe. I went away the week they installed it and when I came back the holes had not been filled in, they'd killed several of my bushes, had cut numerous irrigation lines, and it took WEEKS for them to complete the job. It seems their star employee had to go out of town on a family crisis and not one other worker could follow through competently on the job. They kindly gave me $250 off the price of the job, but for $8000 I feel the need to warn other consumers.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>The quality of the work and response time were great but the cost was very exorbitant. I needed a water heater elevated and strapped before selling my parents home. This required some re-piping but the cost of $1400.00 to do this work was way too high after talking to some other plumbers.<//text><user_id>101244193699303248867</user_id>< time>

I called Wizard at 4:00 and they were at my house by 5:00 and done by 5:30.  Great service.  FYI to Wizard — your guys wore their booties but they didn’t take them off when they went back and forth to their truck.  That meant the booties were useless.  They did bring in dirt and didn’t clean up after themselves. So I have a working toilet but I get to clean up.<//Review>

<Text>Called them out for a clogged drain at noon on a Sunday. They gave us a 3 - 5 pm window. The tech arrived promptly at 3pm and spent 90 minutes working on finding the clog. He was able to determine the clog was a collapsed pipe in the ground outside of the house. Since he wasn't able to clear the clog, he didn't charge us. Really appreciate the way they conduct business. The tech was on time, super polite and very professional. We will call them back again in the future.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Wizard Plumbing  has come to my house about three times in the last few years and every time they do, I wonder why I bother calling any other company. They are fast, friendly efficient, and professional, all the way from the dispatcher to the technicians. Their prices are fair and they do it right the first time. I will only call them from now on.</review>< pictures>

Wizard plumbing did a fantastic job with our sewer problems.  They also detected our kitchen pipes were corroded and leaking so they fixed that as well.  They promise a certain price, timeline and work required and met all their promises.  These guys take pride in their work and make sure everything is working to your expectations.  Highly recommended.</Review>

I recently had occasion to call Wizard Plumbing and Drain for a blocked sewer line between my garage and the street.

Although it was late at night, Franco was at my house within half an hour of my call. He had actually been about to go to bed, but he got up, got dressed, and came right over.

The service he provided was professional, courteous and fast. I was particularly  impressed by the care he took to avoid bumping into our furnishings or scratching our floor as he maneuvered his equipment through our house. Franco not only fixed the problem, he was able to show me the cause of the blockage (tree roots) by running a TV camera through our pipes to the street. I highly recommend Wizard Plumbing and Drain and especially Franco and I  would not hesitate to call them again.</review>

Majed from Wizard Plumbing did a great job! The scope of work included replacing the main water shut off valve, a leaking hose bib and 35 feet of old galvanized steel pipes with copper. He also installed a pressure regulating control valve to mitigate the high water pressure coming into the house. Majed was very polite, friendly and explained everything clearly. I would definitely recommend them.<//Text>

<Review>I have a Buisness in SSF and had 2 backed up showers which shares the same drain on a Sunday afternoon and needed someone to come out and Rooter the drains asap. Not only did they come out promptly they were super professional and did not overcharge me as other companies tried to do. Their  pricing is reasonable and I have already stored their number in my contact list for the next time I need plumbing work. If you need plumbing work look no further then Wizard plumbing!<//Review><Rate>5</Rate><Gmap_id>0x808f9ef96934005d:0x7fa8b9f2ad184495</Gmap_id><Name>pankaj patel< /Name></record></dataset><record>

PRIOR REVIEW: They did come out same day and they did fix the problem.  But he gave me an estimate of $375, which I agreed to, but it turned out it was less than  20minutes of work.  I wouldn't use them again. It’s predatory pricing.< /Review>< pics>

<Time>1532050331188< /Time><text>Steve at Wizard plumbing truly is a wizard of the pipes. We've had him out four times for problems at different old houses ranging from small and very big. Steve is intuitive and insightful, but also thinks through multiple possibilities, then clearly and crisply explains his hypotheses, and uses the scientific method to quickly make initial tests and confirm that he has the right problem and right solution. Of the seven plumbing companies we have dealt with, Wizard plumbing is the best! We also appreciate that Wizard plumbing's appointment and billing person Tina is excellent: she promptly returns calls (even as far as we can tell on weekends) and can usually get someone out same day, and is willing to text and email with you to arrange appointment and billing.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The guys were there within 30 minutes of my call. They were knowledgeable and professional, all the way down to the booties they put on to walk in my house. The work was done exactly as hoped and my kitchen  was probably cleanwe when they left than when they arrive. Would definitely recommend Wizard.< /Text>

<Review>They did remove a difficult to remove nut but that was only part of the job. They didn't finish the job of installing a faucet. They didn't clean up. Took old parts without asking - no big deal but since the job isn't over who knows what I could use.
I wanted a new faucet installed and now I have nothing.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I called Wizard at 9:15 AM. By 9:30 AM David and Daniel arrived at the door. I gave them a shower faucet mixer pressure balancing cartridge to replace a malfunctioning old one. There were a few complications which David quickly figured out. The installation was completed and they were out the door by 10:30 AM. Now that's what I call prompt, knowledgeable and efficient plumbing service. Wizard plumbers are indeed wizards.< /Text><Response>None< /Response>< Pictures>

<Text>We have used Wizard in the past to put in copper pipes and for a water heater. So when our toilet was in trouble I immediately looked them up.

Boy was I surprised and pleased they were open till 10 p.m. yesterday. I called and the stars aligned and Franko and Geraldo sp were available and came out right away. It was a simple snake job. Franko was very pleasant and clear in his explanations. The whole process was done within the hour.

Thanks a lot, guys!</Text>< pics>

OMG Wizard Plumbing is the BEST.   I had 2 small plumbing disasters this year that needed immediate attention.  One was a garbage disposal that developed a leak so that every time I turned on the kitchen faucet, all the water leaked right out of the pipe and out onto the floor.  The second one happened last night. I lifted the lever of my kitchen faucet and it broke off in my hand.   I do not have a dishwasher, therefore I had to wash all of my dishes in the bathtub. Not pretty.  I immediately called Wizard Plumbing & Drain,  and this was at 7 pm last night.  I  received a call back from them this morning and as I write this now, the problem is fully solved.  In both cases, the turnaround was fantastic.   At this point, I have them on speed dial.</text>

We used Wizard for replacement of a water heater. The person who answered the phone on a weekend was helpful and called to status when we were 90 minutes into our 2 hour arrival window. The two technicians who arrived were helpful, communicative and worked quickly. Thanks Wizard!<//review>

<text>I called on a weekend morning, and the dispatcher gave me a 2-hour window shortly afterward.  Manny and Isaac were on time and super professional.  They unclogged the drain for my kitchen sink, and left the area cleaner than before their arrival.  Highly recommend.</text><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

I was in desperate need of a plumber and, when I called Wizard, they sent two technicians out within a few hours.  They worked quickly and efficiently, explained the problem to me, and left my two bathrooms cleaner than when they arrived.  That's my idea of customer service.<//Review>

Service was great! I showed what the problem was, which was a broken grommet seal. They said that the grommet seal usually breaks when replacing the wires. So no need to do anything. That was good. But $190 is really steep for just turning back on the gas valve and also re-lighting the flame on my water heater. I should have just done it myself after they showed me how to do it, but I didn’t trust myself.<//review>

David with the help of Daniel worked hard at unclogging our very backed up kitchen sink. We have an Eichler home which always presents problems when an issue with home repairs occur as it did with clearing our pipes. But they got it done and they were awesome! Totally recommend Wizard Plumbing.<//review>

<text>When was the last time you called a plumbing service company for a blocked sewer line at 9 AM and they arrived 90 minutes later? I certainly expected to be told that Wizard Plumbing would schedule an appointment on Monday July 8th when I called on July 2nd. Instead I got a delightful dispatcher who said they would be there by 11 AM. Freddie and Jesus showed up and quickly determined that the sewer line was separated from the county line and needed to be dug up. Since we are in an unincorporated section of San Mateo county it took three sets of permits before the job could be started. On July 3rd they dug up our sewer line and reattached it to the county line and we had working plumbing before the 4th. Outstanding from start to finish in my book.< /text><date>1562617252147<//date><name>Glenn Scheitrum< /name><user>117529580828201149622< /user></record></dataset><record>

We live in a home with only one bathroom and when the toilet is stopped up and there’s overflow from the drain outside, you want someone to come quickly. They were there within two hours of my call and found tree roots that were causing the problem.  I was very pleased with their efficient service.<//Review>

<text>We used wizard plumbing for a rental that was backing up in San Mateo it ended up being a broken sewer line towards the street that was underneath a power pole,   They talked to the renters for us told them what was going on, pulled the permits and got the  power company there to pull the pole out while they dug it out and replaced it , they are very reasonable and professional,   I would definitely use them again  and Definitely recommend.</text>< Pictures>

This is the third time I have used Wizard Pluming all for different reasons. Today, I had the sink in the kitchen "snaked".  David Yepez and his assistant were very professional and the cost was reasonable.

I have found the owner, Mark, very helpful and sincere at providing good professional plumbing services. He cares about his team and provides oversight on all his plumbers. Thank You Mark.< /review>

<review>Had a Saturday morning sewer problem. The dispatcher said they would be out between 11 and one. I asked Steve M. to diagnose the problem and he recommended we change our plumbing from 3" to 4" and get rid of some 90 degree angles. He took the time to answer all my questions. Unfortunately, the toilet had to be removed to get a snake in there to flush things out. I like small local companies.<//review>< Pictures>

She called one of the plumbers and had them out first thing the very next morning and they got our bathroom up and running. You never know how much you love your bathroom until you can't use it. Their prices were reasonable and they left my bathroom nice and clean and in working order.

Excellent job done by Mario and his team. Replaced my leaking A.O. Smith Vertex water heater (that had a faulty flue which caused premature corrosion) with a simpler Bradford white water heater.
Mario spotted the faulty flue (due to shoddy initial installation of the water heater 7 years ago) and fixed it for a small addition cost.

His price was better then 2 other Yelp competitors and the quality appears to be excellent. I would strongly recommend them.< /text>

<review>Issue - a Rohl shower drip. Shower hardware was at least 11yrs old (possibly older) and ha Hot/Cold dial that was not engaging (spinning). Had a replacement cartridge that came  from Rohl. What Wizard did was to replace the cartridge, caulk the areoa behind the on/off dial. The cartridge didn’t work for Hot/Cold but the did clean the metal filter and got it engaging again.
Time: 9am -2:15pm including a trip offsite for the Hot/Cold hardware (1 day). Shower drip got resolved so I’m happy.< /review>< user>

Water heater service call.
2 hr window given..
$254 charge for thermocouple replacement..
The parts anywhere online range from $10-$15.
$254-$15 = $239 for 20 mins labor...
Only 30 day warranty for such high cost.

If you have time and can search around, get another quote.<//Review>

We have had Wizard out twice in the last two days. The first time was for a shower back up that was coming from a plug in the main line (roots, argh). We had received an estimate from Roto-Rooter for $700; thankfully, Mark was able to fix the problem in short order for $189.

Unfortunately, the flow back had caused another clog somewhere higher up the line, causing a leak when we run water on the other side of the house. I was able to loosen this myself with a 25' auger (thinking I had fixed the problem). In the process of accessing the drain, however I bumped an attachment to the sink which began to leak and was extremely difficult to access. Mark came back, and fixed the problem at absolutely zero cost, even though he had driven out, provided his expert opinion, and spent close to half an hour tightening it up.<//Text>

<review>Place is very clean. All who work there are friendly. They got our dog in quickly, hardly any wait. Answered my questions and we got necessary medicine - clear instructions and determined dog needed an allergy shot. Then scheduled a teeth cleaning appointment. They gave me an estimate so we know the cost. Smooth, nice, friendly visit.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< Review>
I take all of my animals here.  I didn't like the fact that the one time I took my pet elsewhere, they wanted to make me wait in the car and just take my animal inside, due to covid.  I want to be a part of the appointment, my gosh how am I going to wait in the car and allow a vet, whom I cannot even see treat my fur baby? Not only that, but I haver dropped off many pets for surgery, and they are not traumatized at all when I pick them up, even when an invasive procedure is done without sedation.</Review>

I loved Dr Bob, they were great on the phone. a little rushed when I was there, not very calming,partly due to my PTSD and the Pitbull attack I believe it's just something I'm going to have to learn to deal with even though I thought I was getting close to being over it I am far from it.
I will be seeing Dr Bob in Chester with the new pups Friday I pray that goes a lot calmer< /text>

<Text>Dr. Kasey, Annette, Danielle and Kate are fabulous! My dog, Molly, was miserable. They got her in immediately, did bloodwork and x-rays. Dr. Kasey knew then she had to stay. After some TLC and meds, I picked her up the next day and Molly's doing so much better! I may have lost her if it wasn't for them and I'm so grateful! I highly recommend this office.<//Text></record>

I bring my cat there at least one a month and they are great. Dr. Taylor is an amazing surgeon and the staff are quick to take care of your needs. The office manager, Annette was amazing to help me figure out what I needed to do to improve the well being of my cat. 11 out of 10!!!< /Review>

<text>It was very busy and they were short handed, however, everyone was treated with courtesy and as quickly as possible. There is a vet by the name of Todd Taylor that I met for the first time. He was very thorough and repeated my questions to make sure I was clear.

Very disappointed in this office, was quoted a price for a procedure and came in the day of the procedure to find out it was going to cost me over double what I was quoted and they refused to honor their receptionist original quote. They will never have buisness from us again.</Review>

Great staff! They are very kind and caring.

Update: 2 years later and they are still an amazing vet. Whenever I need them, which is often, they never hesitate to help. They constantly go above and beyond to make sure that we are taken care of and more importantly that my pets are taken care of.</Text>

<Review>The care is ok, knowledgeable and good surgeons.  There is a major problem if you have an emergency or need to speak to the vet on weekends or evenings after closing.  Either there is no answering service or the answering service cannot get ahold of a veterinarian.  I  am basing this on 5 tries over a period of about a month.  There is sometimes a vet assistant available on Saturday mornings, but only for very routine items and the veterinarians are not available then.  If your pet is healthy all the time, and will stay that way it's entire life--no problem.  But 2 days and all evenings of the week you may not be able to contact a vet which seems to be the norm for this county.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1577496463998, 'text': "Sorry it took so long to respond.

<Review>Worst haircut I’ve received so far. Left the back of my head looking like it’s been a month since it got cut. Trimmed my beard hair short in some places, leaving dark and light spots, and changed the shape of my beard line I had going. Put “clay” in my hair without asking (even after I stated I don’t use product at the beginning).

Absolutely terrible, I will not be returning again. Waste of $22 and the haircut lady should have her license revoked. Looks like Stevie Wonder cut my hair.

Look at how the haircut lady let me walk out of the store with my beard line. Who on earth would let someone walk out of their business looking like this?<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmR5AZR8ZNYURHFfr82Ae3fa1CIzyb5sAuJ5tS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6vgi04aJa1FOp6fyiphZSrJqtk5LANCheoMPT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM49GrWIDTKQ2ZdqowJLm_qzQ8swVY1B-RzRCr_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMN7AguJ10qc5KfCbRYPPys7nZhfVN06pdHoL6a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

<Text>Anne took great care of me. She was and is professional, courteous, and listens to and gave me what I asked for. Anne is the reason I will be returning to sports clips.
Anne will go above and beyond the call of duty to see that you are not just satisfied, but elated on how your hair looks.

<text>Tina was amazing from the second I opened the door! She happily greeted me and helped me check in - being it was my first time. There was no wait (because I checked online before I left) so she was able to take me right back. There was no problem explaining the haircut I was looking for. I showed Tina a few pictures, she asked a couple questions, and then worked her magic! She used clippers and shears and stopped along the way to tell me what she was doing and show me progress. Very friendly and made me feel comfortable the entire time I was there. To top it off, the haircut was extremely affordable. Best price for an awesome cut, hands down! I don't normally take the time to leave reviews, but this experience deserved it. I've been in CA for 2 years now and this is the very first time I've been please after a haircut. This will definitely be my spot from now on. Thank you so much!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1573776218904, 'text': "Hi Jess, thank you for your feedback.

My son who’s 12 he was impressed and so am I. He’s in a swim team so he’s constantly in the water. We love the way the lady explains to him how important it’s to clean his hair and massage his scalp after swimming with a good shampoo so we bought the shampoo as well. Thank you so much! My son is looking forward to go back to Del Mar Sport Clips.

< Review>
Showed up here because it was close by and I needed a haircut for a date. I was running low on time so I found this location close to where I was at. They saw me very quickly and the haircut was on point and didn’t take long at all. I was also sold some product for my hair and it didn’t feel pressured at all. I don’t live anywhere near this location but I’ll probably be back anyways!<//Review>

<text>Most of the stylists at Sports Clips Del Mar Height could use some training in listening to the client.  More than 50% of the haircuts I have received there are cut way too short.  When the stylist asks me how I would like my hair cut, I give a specific amount of hair to be cut off.  But the stylist just cuts my hair in the quickest manner possible.

Perhaps they would give a better haircut if there were more stylists, so it doesn't make it seems that they are in such a hurry.</text><Name>Nancy and Randy French< /Name>< rating>

The service was excellent and the staff friendly.  I told my barber to leave the sides long and just trim the fuzzies from my ears and neck.  Also to shorten just the long hairs hanging over my brow.  My barber got carried away, evidently, and did much too much scissors work all over, including the sides that I wished to not shorten.  What was she thinking?  I'm not in the military nor in public service.  I want to keep my hair full on the sides.  Not happy with the results.<//Review>

< Review>
The lady that cut my son’s hair on 9/13did an amazing job (I’m sorry I don’t recall her name) She truly cared about giving him the best hair cut ever which is difficult because he has lots of hair and super thick. In addition, my husband had totally messed it up by attempting to do it himself. It was a disaster, but she didn’t rush and fixed the unfixable and made it looked perfect! Needless to say my son was extremely happy and so was I. Thank you so much for your hard work! You Rock!</Review>

First time visiting Sport Clips. I checked services available beforehand, MVP, Triple Play, etc. I had already shampooed that day so didn't accept the offer of a free shampoo for first time customers. No massage or hot towel was offered. When I left, I was billed for a full MVP experience.  Maybe I'm off base but that doesn't seem like how I would treat a first time customer.</Text>

This is my favorite place to get a haircut. The women who work there are all great people and are very fast. They also welcome friendly dogs and will give them treats and water. This Sport Clips makes you feel apart of a community.</Review>

This place is great. The price is half of what you would pay at a salon and the haircut is the same quality. My kids love this place. You can watch sports while you are getting your haircut. Hard to beat watching the Padres and getting your haircut.< /review>

I "had" been going there and I guess playing Russian Roulette with my hair for 3 years. After not cutting my hair for three and a half months I went in for a trim before a TV interview. First question - what would you like? Basic Trim nothing more. Second Question - about this much, 1/2 inch? Yes no more. 15 minutes later and I have both sides and back cut down to military grade high and tight and a general mess on top. I have calmed down to the point where I will go in to have them fix whatever hair I have left for free then I go somewhere else.

So I call in to ask for the manager to call so I can get what hair I have left fixed and no call back. I know they can't re-grow hair but they can at least get rid of the ridges she made by not knowing how to use clippers. Oh that reminds me I said "NO CLIPPERS" she forgot that as well.<//text>

<Review>Literally just had to fix a haircut from here. The lady missed several spots on the back of his head, did not know how to blend apparently and took a chunk out of the top of his hair....that was just the aftermath.  During the haircut she complained the entire time about the work environment, how she couldn't grab his hair(what?!?), and other personal issues.  She then upcharged for a previously promised complimentary wash. The worst experience, absolutely will not be returning.<//Review><Date>1531512616570<//Date><name>Haley Valacich< /name><user_id>105813596918439016599< /user_id>< resp>

<Review>I typically go to Supercuts, but after my first visit at SportClips I will no longer be going to Supercuts. Price point is similar and since it was my first time I even got a massage...I now know how my wife feels at her fancy salons. Anne cut my hair and did a great job. She was very friendly and listened to exactly what I wanted. Overall, very impressed with SportsClips and thanks Anne!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Asked for a low fade just above the ears. Left with my hair almost 2 inches shorter and almost a high fade. Just a cycle of messing up and then having to go higher and shorter to fix the mistake.<//text>

<Text>JIM guy at the desk goes “why would such people come at the last minute” it was half an hour before their closing time, arrogant and will not entertain you if you walk in within half an hour of closing time. He was adamant of not doing my western union money transfer. I gave him all IDs required, still kept telling NO. I will report this to western union and make sure they know their policies and rules.

<Text>I don't like when a person wave me off like an animal and in my households my animals get respect. So I think I just keep pass right by this store no all places you money have real value just a person making you money no true care for your customer.

<Review>This was just a quick stop to pick up a drink for my grandson,  he wanted some apple juice. They were fine, just not really  nice to me,  but not rude either. They have too much stuff in that store!  The reason it takes 10 minutes is because you are trying to find what you need. It works if it's a quick stop for one or two things.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

When you asked for a bowl they give you a cup. It would be nice when you ask for a bowl that the person at the register points out that they do not have bowls we can put it in a cup for you but no they do not mention that at all until you go pick up a small cup which is half not even half of what you would get in a bowl. Very disappointing< /Text>

This does not change your favorite bowl recipe but means we’ll build bowl orders in a funky fresh Jamba cup instead of a bowl for now.  Thank you for your patience.'}< /Response>

<review>Not a very great place. But since it is chain restaurants to Jamba Juice.. Can expect their policies and commitments are there..  the place is not clean and lot of smoking environments.. feeling bad to bring kids..<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOla030JNx9lfMBRrs6ptGANusb9zEy0t4R0x4j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJSYzJxDP6yyvTthPJAO7pXFKIN_xOtCWwbk7g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpjiv3ue_sRmBqWTep4lz_8RxIJpjyzdyFPjPz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLMcFoPSswJkHNMDEjClaCqOdTNzaiPxC13fai=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9GupovviNigUwVlzcwUDNDY-Z78vCgFsXB0Ov=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrGPN5FiLH_IZWzAHsEfOIsDFe38_daZOnTcYd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6oEBDGtfGZZFidoB857zMLLUb1RpjryOXLi12=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8aBvq0fpVGr1VNiiZv5Q9oy2alx6sFuIswaod=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiuj_vL21V3phqcpUNKILdbixFqpp4NLQ5_gyZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkHjquWr6h_qQGVwIrJEAZo8wfE3OWOfeob1h9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPR0YBwBHScXFTdKxCJpPM55YSEC3GHZ-c3MJSw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGeztopbufRoL7DYhqiHUfhNSri_a6eU0ziWQR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8-vt9C41YrHhzTb4_tGRCLTsdywqZFvnl7bb3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzrCzt0Pvo_AgmgvcKSWbSF8ixrdjnmWskCzHb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOaoR2Lj7WAuApd4voqsFlQhQDDus-H4zBAf71=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnjfBwRcY7k79JKw7vDbNqUYXf_sxUuIydZVhL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpuAMivJkKg5jek_pQC0Llgh-sZFeTrA9S7cHc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1505571238109, 'text': 'Anil, we always want our guests to have a positive experience at Jamba.

Also I came back on January 5th 2021 and Braden & Mia we're the only two working. They handled things very efficiently & friendly.Also Braden helped me with my phone app because orange Berry Blitz is not on the menu but they will make it for you.Time for employee raise because you have excellent workers there.<//Text>

Did they mix something up with another order? I don't know). It's my own fault I didn't taste it till I'd already left, but I could see that kind of subsitution without asking going much worse with someone else's if it's something they can't exactly tolerate sensitivities-wise maybe. I probably won't be coming back to this location, but it was my first time going anyway so it's no biggie. Sorry for the long ramble, but please check your smoothies when you ask for subsitutions. They could be having an off day or something, there wasn't exactly lighting or ventilation in that place, even with an open door. I felt kind of bad for the people working there, it probably sucked.</Review><Rate>2<//Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Name>

This is Savage man has great customer service to offer. But it's not being very well maintained as their blenders are not working properly they have approximately five blenders but only one really Blends your beverage properly. The other ones just gradually mix it. This will cause a delay if you're in a hurry because you asked me for your drinks to be properly Blended. Instead an assembly line has been created to give the appearance as though everything is working smooth but in reality if they had three good blenders you be in and out the door locked faster</review>

love this place. All the staff is super friendly and have wonderful pleasant personalities. They treat you like you matter. The manager is extremely personable and is competent when it comes to get job. I love this place and their ice is the best I've ever had. Their drinks are excellent if you're trying to watch your sugar intake. Health minded individuals should love this place and their yummy drinks and eats, although few, what they DO have to eat is v delicious. The price of everything has gone up, which makes it hard for many of us, myself included. I wish I could come more often, I juice at home too, but at home I cannot get the one-of-a-kind ice that I can't get anywhere else. Make sure you tip these people because they are super friendly and deserve every cent.</review>

<Text>I go there with my kids all the time and each time we order a small smoothie for me and my girls split a medium smoothie. I always ask the staff to pour the medium smoothie into two smaller cups. Today they poured our medium into these ultra tiny paper cups. I asked the girl if she was sure this is the right size, and she confidently told me it amounts to what I ordered. There was more of my medium smoothie left in the blender and they chose to throw away the rest.

When we got home I filled up the two paper cups with water and poured them into the small size plastic cup, which did not overfill. In fact, did not even fill all the way up. There is no way these two paper cups make up the next size up, and that was the proof right there.

Everything here is overpriced for what it is, but we have never felt this cheated before.

This is how customers are lost. Not coming back.</Text>< Pictures>

Very bad customer service by Makhiyah L!!!  Arguing with the customer even if it was her inefficiency that led to the mistake on the order. Both her and the other lady at the back, Trinidad. I would not recommend this location, will never go back.</review>

The staff who made my juice was dumb. I needed to wait over 30mins to get just one midium size of a peach juice. First of all, the staff said they were out of peach, so they couldn't put peaches in my juice. Second, the staff made a mistake over and over again actually 4 times!!! for just one medium size juice! Again! I really upset about that. You guys have recipe, right? Idiot.</Review>

I went in for a smoothie today. The staff was distracted by an off duty employee that was chatting them up. My smoothie still had chunks of cucumber and lemon rind. No ice so it was not that cold and super watery.

The off duty employee and on duty staff were also talking bad about what seems like a regular customer in front of everyone. Not cool.< /text>

Today was the 4th time in less than a month there juicer was broken. I’m thinking they are just lazy to make juice or the corporate doesn’t really care about bad equipment.</Review>

The gas might be cheaper here, but the owners do not offer refunds for recently expired car washes, citing an arbitrary policy. It's their choice of course, same as my choice not to bring my business back.<//Review>

<review>This is the best gas station in the area.  It's clean, well stocked and multiple staff on hand.  The only down fall is the selection of snacks and drinks available inside.  Maybe it's just me, but my gas seems to last longer after filling up from here.  Overall, a great place with some of the lowest price gas in the area.</review>< GmapID>

After years of neglect and renovation, the new Shell is open for business. Currently, the station only sells gas, but in the future, concessions will be available. This gas station currently has the lowest prices on the street. Hopefully it remains inexpensive in order to create competition between the other three gas stations on the same stretch of road.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Parking lot is a mess, very tight and hard to get to the 711/clerk if you just need to get something quick and forget about getting gas when they are refueling the tanks. The truck pretty much blocks the pump to the point it will take one car 30 minutes to get gas and get out<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) Very expensive petrol station. There is only one petrol station here. It is more expensive without peer competition. It is cheaper to go to other places.
The atmosphere is not very good, the waiter who went in to buy things is not good.

(Original)
很貴的油站，這裡只有他一家油站，沒有同行競爭所以比較貴，去別的地方加油會較便宜。
氛圍不是很好，進去買東西服務員的態度不好。<//Review>

I was in a pinch to get a VIN inspection taken care of. The fine folks at Joe’s took care of me in a fast and assuring manner, despite clearly being busy themselves. I am happy to have found this business.<//review>

<Review>I will never enter the DMV again. It will cost a bit more - but not having to go to the DMV is worth a lot of money.

Tried to register my car at the DMV three times, turned away each time (thanks COVID)

They did it in 15 minutes. Quick smog check, too.

Great, family run small business.</Review>< pics>

A great place to get your smog certificate work done. A little small parking area but they are fast and efficient.< /Text>

Awesome service and people.  They do VIN verification, brake and light inspection, registration and repairs and of course smog.  It's a husband and wife team, both very nice professional people.  I highly recommend Joe's Smog for all your DMV registration, repair and smog needs.  It's a one stop shop.<//Text>

<date>1497925713487</date><Review>I recently bought a used vehicle, which failed the smog test on visual, functional, and emissions. The smog tech at Joe's took time to advise me on what to look out for, what to fix and return for the free retest. I followed his advice, and found additional malfunctioning parts that I replaced on my own with some online research. I returned with all repairs completed on my own and passed with extremely low emissions and it is now CA state legal!

< Review>
I've had a similarly bad experience with the pricing of this business's service.  Their coupon said nothing about the price not being applicable if you fail the test.  I did fail and the owner said that I then needed to pay full price.  Good thing I wasn't in a confrontational mood that day!

UPDATE:  ...and it got worse.  Went back today for the re-test only to be told that since it had been three weeks since the original test it was no longer free.  It does, in fact, say so on the receipt... but I don't read receipts, as most people don't.

I left, went to Auto Check Centers in Hollywood, and will never be back to this place again.

Avoid them.  They're flat out crooks.< /Review>

<review>They knew I wouldn't pass smog because my check engine light was on. Instead of doing the right thing and informing me it wouldn't pass. They took my money anyways. They have some stupid coupon system in place. It's a rip off. They might have taken 60 dollars from me once but they lost my business forever. And everyone I know will now how shitty this place is. STAY AWAY.</review>< pictures>

<Name>Connor Delaney< /Name><Time>1397601192763</Time><review>The people there were non-native English speakers, and the guy behind the counter wasn't super friendly, but the guy actually doing the test was very helpful and polite. He took my keys to start the check while I was still filling out the paperwork, then came back and told me what my mileage was without me even having to ask so I could put it on the form, which was great because I forgot to check beforehand. They accepted the coupon from the website, it didn't feel like they were trying to sell me anything I didn't need, and I didn't have to wait longer than 5-10 minutes so I was able to head right back over to the DMV down the street. I think they did a fine service and if you're looking for a convenient place while you're at the DMV, this place is more than adequate.</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c00f5fe37da3:0x25d791661e41eaa9< /Gmap_id></record>

Great place to get your smog test owners are very nice and take the time to advise on any issues you may have with your vehicle. They also provide dmv servises without the hasel of a huge line. I will definitely be going there again.<//Review>

<review>This place is AWESOME!!!! They were so friendly and helpful. We were in an incredible hurry to get our SUV smog checked and registered so we could sell it to Carmax and then make it to LAX in 2 hours. It did not seem possible, but they got us in and out in 30 minutes flat and took care of everything from the smog check, to getting the vehicle registered with the DMV on the spot, and then also providing the stickers for the plates. It was total one stop shop, without the hassle of the DMV. Then we sold the SUV and made it to LAX with time to spare.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Joe's Smog Center!!!!!!!!
Thanks so much for helping us out.<//review>< Pics>

Don't rely on their ad...
I was there today with my Corolla 2001, after filling out all documents I mentioned the guy that I have the coupon for $35 but he said that he only does that for $60. I left there without getting any service.</Text>

Hands-down the best experience I’ve ever had dealing with insurance. Ask for Mrs. Linda as she will help you through every step of your way being your first time or experienced in dealing with insurance. She took the time to walk me through every step and make sure I had the most affordable rate for my budget and make sure I was on the road safely thank you Miss Linda your help is much appreciated.</Text>

< Review>
Linda Thorng was incredibly sweet and helpful when it came to helping me get my policy started. I have some pretty special circumstances with my driving record and she was patient, responsive and super helpful. She went over several options for me so I know she was doing everything in her power to get me the best coverage at the lowest cost. What sets Linda apart is that you can actually tell that she *wants* to help you, and she’s not just trying to get her job done. I really appreciate her and would definitely recommend working with her :)<//Review>

<text>Acquiring insurance has never ,in my opinion a enjoyable experience, but my agent Linda provided for me a professional ,courteous, and knowledgeable guide in selecting coverage that was right for me and not just selling me a policy. I can’t thank you enough for you patience and mindfulness throughout the process. I will certainly be referring everyone in my network to you for all of their auto as well as business insurance needs. Thanks again Linda

<Review>My family has been with them for years, and everyone is very helpful and friendly. We are very satisfied with our insurance policy.. May Thao is our agent, and whenever I had a problem or any questions at all, she would get right back to me. She’s always looking for a cheaper and better deal for us, every year that we renew our policy.</Review>< pics>

Acceptance Insurance is amazing and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for any auto insurance whether you just started driving or not get your auto insurance here! They’ll find you the best deals for auto insurance! May Thao was a huge help for helping me find the cheapest insurance for my vehicle. Anything you need go to May Thao or anyone in the office! They are really professional and friendly!< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Acceptance insurance is so far the best insurance I have had. Linda Thorng has an excellent customer service. She is very good for the company. I was very satisfied of the service she provided. She is very detailed and ready to answer your questions anytime. I been with, from a different insurance company for more than 10 years but they don’t offer me great services and benefits like what Acceptance insurance has offered with same amount value that I paid. I’m glad I switch and I made the right choice.</Text>< Pictures>

I would definately recommend them for anyone who needs car insurance or any type of insurance. Just ask for May Thao, she has helped me and I was recommended by my mom. Just give them a call and see what they can do for you and your family.

May with Acceptance Auto Insurance is amazing. I have been with her for over 10 years and every year she has gone above and beyond to get me and my husband the very best rate. No hassles, just great service for my family. It’s so nice to have someone care about your families needs and not just treat you like a paycheck. Thank you as always May!< /Text>

Thank you Linda for getting me out of a jam! I needed new auto insurance asap, and without hassle, Linda was able to quote me different prices that were within my budget. I've gotten help from Linda before with my older car, but now I have a new one and I'll only trust Linda in the 209.</review>

May has been my insurance lady for about  10 years and i have never had an issue with my policy or with her.
She has always given me the best rate and best service.
I have referred her to a couple of my co workers and they have also started a new policy with her.
She is a great asset to your company, and she know her insurance she has multiple awards and recognition's on her wall.</review>< Pics>

Called in to get a quote on my 2011 g37. Spoke to a guy named Tawer about getting full coverage for my new car. He gave me a really good price and went over the different coverage options as I wasn’t sure which one to select. He made this process really easy and I look forward to insuring all of my future vehicles with him!!!<//Text>

<Review>I cannot say enough good things about this Acceptance location especially because of Tawer Michael. He has been nothing short of amazing in explaining every aspect of the policy I was about to purchase and his customer service skills spoke volumes above the rest. I dealt with a few other agencies before coming to Acceptance and just because of the service Tawer provided me, I have chosen to purchase with him. I will recommend him and his location to anyone in my circle that is needing new insurance!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Linda Thorng is one of the most pleasant employees I've ever met. She knows her job incredibly well and is extremely accommodating. I highly recommend this location. One thing I think would help is an automated phone service; phonecalls often distract the workers who are seated with clients. The agents handle it perfectly, but it would much more fluid if phonecalls were routed elsewhere.</Review>< pics>

Very helpful & friendly staff. You get greeted with smiles, then leave with cheap insurance 👍 Linda helped me understand the payment plans very clearly versus other insurance places that give 'vague descriptions of their plans and underlining surprise fees'.<//review>

Tawer is a great agent.  He works very hard to give you the best coverage for your needs.  When you need something he responds almost immediately.  I searched 3 other companies.  But Tawer Michael came through.< /review>

<review>I just purchased my first car and needed insurance ASAP, my brother suggested Acceptance Auto Insurance, and they were able to help me within a short amount of time. May’s customer service was great. She multitasked to help me and another customer at the same time and before we knew it we were out the office, satisfied. Thank you very much to the staff at Acceptance Auto Insurance for helping me find the right insurance. Highly recommend this business to others searching for insurance.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1538423969688, 'text': "Thanks so much!

Walked in and was greeted by tawer. He sat me down and went over my policy options and took the time to let me know the details of each option before I made my decision. I recommend tawer to anyone who is looking to make changes to their existing insurance or to start a new policy.<//review>

Not very helpful and very expensive rates. Went there for commerical quote and it was one of the highest, they told me to do regular insurance and they will beat any price. I went back there and turns out their quotes are again one of the highest compare to others.</Text>

I called in to get a Quote and the young lady Kurtisa helped me out with really understanding my coverage. She took her time in detailing everything for me I would recommend people to her if they don't understand there policy.< /Review>
