I would say that this new team is more thorough and much better at communication. Which is very important when it comes to health & dental health. My family has moved a lot further away from this location however, due to their service, we are willing to continue to make that drive.
Thanks guys!

The Dentist himself was a very nice man. Great bedside manner. I felt comfortable with him. I was most impressed by  his speed, efficiency and finesse as a technician! He has exceptional skills. He kept making sure that I didn't feel any pain at all. He was all business. My root canal was over before I knew it. Very expeditious and smooth. I would recommend this office to any and all!</text>< Pictures>

At first we where impressed with service here. But now its a horrible experience. They give you an appointment and then once you get to your appointment they take almost an hour to see you. I had a crown done here. I already have come 4 times. 1 the temporary crown they put broke. Did not installed it properly. 2nd time i went my crown did not fit they have to prep another one. But couldn’t do it the same day. So i had to come back another day. 3rd day   Got my prep for new crown. Now i have to go back Because the temporary fell off again and by simply mouth washing. If the assistant nurse will do her job correctly this would not be happening now i have to go back and waste another 2 hours because they do not do their job properly. They always seem to be  in the rush with you. This  is just me. My wife have her stories on her own. Same thing with crowns. She has been disappointed with service. Looking some elsewhere now. But since i already paid for this i have to get crown installed. Front desk polite. But one assistant nurse in particular seems does not  get along with the Dr and always in a hurry.<//Review>< rating>

My experience at this office was horrible, the only good part was the front desk was friendly beyond that the nurse/ assistants were horrible no communication not friendly at all, and the doctor didn’t even spend time to go over exactly what I needed and why he just said you need to do certain things with no reasoning, didn’t even spend time going over the treatment with me. I used to go to this office years ago and they were great but seems to me whole new staff including dentist and they all were horrible.<//review>

<text>This place is absolutely pathetic. I went in for an appointment and ended up waiting over 2 hours for them to just give me a piece of paper referring me to another place. The dentist was RUDE. Some staff were nice but this place is completely unorganized. Zero stars. Not my first bad experience here. Never going there again.</text>< pictures>

<review>Love this place! The staff is super friendly and the dentist I had, Dr. Shaw was fantastic! She was gentle and caring. I also like that she is very thorough. She kept having me come back until I was completely satisfied with my dentures. I recommend this place to anyone who has a fear of dentists like I did.

West Coast Dental of Van Nuys has a lovely staff. They are kind, considerate, and sweet.

The hygienist was very sweet, sensitive, and proficient. The assisting technician/financier was also so very sweet, and the doctor focused in on what I needed immediately.

It felt very good that all of their skills played together to get me what it is that I need in order to get and keep my teeth in great working order.

I recommend them!

<Review>I walked into that place feeling very nervous (past experiences with another dentist office) but I was able to relax really fast. From the moment I walked in I was greeted and treated by friendly staff who explained everything. I had two young ladies walk in to the room I was in and they went into details about the procedure and all the after care process. They answered all my question and worked great as a team to get everything done as safe as possible and as fast as they could to get back on my way. My experience was great and I will definitely recommend this office.<//Review><UserId.>112968594923340391701<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

If I could give them less than one star I would. Been there twice with an appointment and had to wait an insane amount time to actually see the oral surgeon. There is no communication between The staff was kind of rude and misinformed. They didn’t have the details of my previous visits and tried to remove the wrong tooth, until I corrected them. Then I waited another 45 minutes to see the surgeon just so they can tell me that I had to go some where else. Don’t go to this dentist!!!< /text>

<Text>I'm giving this 4 Stars because my family and I (total 6) have been attending this facility for a few years now and for the most part we have encountered some really friendly people. The receptionist and the dentist had always this far been superb, but that's not the case for all of the dental assistance.  Most are very friendly bUT at every job you'll always have that one bad apple and unfortunately they have one, which is why they get 4 stars.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

First time client and wouldn’t recommend coming here.

Booked an appointment for 5pm for a teeth cleaning. After waiting for at least an hour overall, they informed me that I was only getting X-rays today and that they couldn’t proceed with any of my treatment plan because my insurance was closed and couldn’t verify copays and blah blah blah. The dentist explained that “any appointments scheduled at 5pm are for X-rays only,” I told her I was disappointed and explained that I would have scheduled the appointment sooner had I known that. She explained she wasn’t the one that talked to me via phone and I said I wasn’t blaming her but that I was disappointed because that’s truly the only reason I went there today (for a teeth cleaning!!!). She said that I couldn’t get the service because it was late and all her assistants went home for the day.

The staff was friendly and the only unprofessional one was the main dentist.<//Review>

This place is horrible!!!!!I wish I could give it no stars. Waiting 3 hours for my kids to be seen with an appointment scheduled the staff has no communication with eachother. No sure what treatments they are doing even with the insurance approval. So what treatment plan did they send to the insurance? The have no regard for the amount of time they make people wait. They allow kids anxiety to build up right before sedations and treatments. Having us come in at 7am for our appointment and not being seen till 10am. I had the appointment scheduled over a month in advance!!! And morning was ready.The ped dentist is only there once a month and if something messes up or a change I’m treatment they refuse to do the treatment that was already pre-approved. They asked me about payment even after I sent over all the insurance paperwork approving treatments with no out of pocket cost. The dentist also has the audacity to ask if I thought about medication for my kids anxiety she suggested I look into the benefits of marijuana medication. My kids are only 8 years old!!!!!! And even adults get anxiety for the dentist. I do not understand how the dentist felt okay asking me about a medical condition that has nothing to do with teeth. Let alone to suggest marijuana for my 8 year olds !?They need to shut this place down. I refuse to take my kids back here.</review>

Now I know it's always good to take heed to the warnings in the reviews. Let's start from the beginning. I went inside the office and scheduled an appointment for a consultation with the oral surgeon set for 1:30pm today. I get a reminder call yesterday with the wrong appointment time so I callback and the receptionist tells me no it's 10:30am (although I have the physical appointment card stating 1:30pm) She then checks the schedule realizes they have a 1:30pm slot available and proceeds to offer me the appointment I already had scheduled. Btw they are lucky it was still available. That didn't cause too much concern though. So fast forward to today. I walk into the office and wasn't acknowledged by any of the 5 or 6 staff members present. An assistant comes up and is looking for the patient, the only reason she spoke to me was to ask if I was the patient. I told her no and that I haven't even been acknowleged and she giggle. I guess the receptionist finally woke up and advised me she'd be with me shortly, which of course wasn't shortly. Then I find out they lost my referral that was faxed over to their office while I was there earlier that week. So I had to contact my dental offixe again to get the referral sent again. She told me to have a seat again. As I waited for 25 more minutes with no idea of what's going on, about 5 staff members took a smoke break with 3 patients still waiting. Finally an hour goes by and the patient they were looking for when I walked in decides to show up for her appointment an hour later. To my surprise, they actually moved her in front of all the patients who came to their appointments on time. When I addressed the situation the receptionist had the audacity to give me an attitude and not apologize for the wait or lack of communication. I asked for all my paperwork back and left. SAVE YOUR TIME AND ENERGY AND AVOID THIS PLACE.<//text>

This is the best dental office I have ever seen.  Dr Perrin Alhavan is the most sincere dentist, most caring and most compassionate.  If there is something higher than a five star ⭐️ I will give to her and her staffs.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I am one of those people that hate the dentist i rather avoid them until im in unbearable pain. I had made a appointment at 12 and came 15 mins early. It so happen that all the front desk people left to go to lunch. One lady stayed and she was on her phone looking up places to go eat. when i stood infront of the desk for 2 mins she never even looked up at me or asked if i needed anything, i went and sat down without bothering her.when i finally got up a second time to ask if they forgot about me.She asked, "whats your name?" She said she would be right with me and never got back to me. They have no communication. I heard her say to herself, "why didnt she finish the file?" She was talking about the girl that went to lunch. I waited 45 mins still nothing, i finally said i would reschedule becuase i have work at 2pm. I looked at the paper and my name was crossed out as if i was already seen. She then says, "my chart is up, the doctors are sharing a room so this is why its like this." She knew it was going to take a hour and she never said anything to me. She was rude by after telling me my chart is up i could still reschedule if i wanted. This place needs real management. This was a disappointment.<//Text>< pics>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I went in knowing from my Dental insurance that I have a copay of $1. When I gave them all my information they told me that it was going to be $120 for the copay and that I would have to pay for an anesthetic. The ladies on reception were just standing around laughing too instead of doing their job. When I went in for my X-rays the assistant said she was going to go as fast as she can and to look at the time so I could tell her how long it took. Then I could not bite down on the mouthpiece they use so I told the assistant and she told me I had to. I had tears in my eyes by how painful it was and I still couldn’t close my mouth all the way. She didn’t care she kept making me try it. I got a sore spot on my mouth and thought the price was just ridiculous so I called to cancel and the lady on the phone was so rude! She kept telling me the price was because my insurance didn’t cover it so I told her just cancel my appointment. She didn’t say good bye I just heard the phone click as she hung up on me. I called back and talked to the supervisor and she apologized and said she would talk to the receptionist and she was actually listening to the conversation when I called. She sounded so insincere AND does she not have a job to do? She must be one of the lady’s that just stands around the reception area instead of doing her job. Save your time, save your money, don’t come here.</review>< Pictures>

This dental office is the most skid row ghetto place and very racist to all color and race. And had their music blasting to R&B artist Rihanna new hit Work Work Work. I've never had a bed experience at a dental office like this ever in my life. They look at you strange and weird hardly speaking like your an alien or something.</text>

<text>This dentist is to say the least, HORRIBLE.

You will never be seen on time.

They recommend things that are not necessary.

They use blatant high pressure sales tactics and attempt to charge you massively in addition to what your insurance supposedly "doesn't" cover; in an attempt to make money off you.

Terrible!! Scam artists! They need to shut this place down!! I had awful experiences here.<//text><Name>Baldev Malhotra<//Name><user>115371442171060912605</user><rate>1< /rate>< Time>

<text>My first day at their office and was promptly and politely greeted. After a very brief wait I was taken in for x-rays and photos of my gums for a new set of dentures. The technician was extremely cautious of not hurting me and very pleasant during both proceedures. Within minutes I was greeted by the Dr and we spoke for a bit and she to very polite, pleasant and concerned as to my needs and desires. I've never had such a nice dental appt. They didn't make me wait forever either as all others I've been to have. Nice to feel it's all about me and not their bank accounts. I highly recommend them based on today especially to those scared and squimish. I used to run out when my name was called but feel safe here<//text>< Pictures>

Very bad for Medi-cal patients (and maybe other insurances I don't know)!!
I just came to the office to have a regular teeth cleaning. After doing x-rays and all they say the doctor recommends (but don't need) laser cleaning to get rid of bacteria in the gums. It is though NOT covered by ANY insurance and costs $150 (takes only 10 min). I decide to think about it and come back the following week. I talked to two of my friends that work as dental assistants in other dental offices  and they told me they never heard of that (my previous dentist in Westwood village never did that to me either) and that the ordinary cleaning should be good enough for now. I come back to my second appointment and decide to just do the cleaning covered by Medi-cal. And this time they tell me they can't do it without the laser so I'm forced to pay the $150 or nothing!!! They obviously just want to pull out more money out of me refusing me service and giving me wrong information. Thanks for making me come to my appointments for nothing and telling me I have no other choice the second time and not the first.

Definitely not coming back.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>This places administration is shady; I went in once and made a plan and agreed on it made an appointment. When I showed up to my appointment the "regional" Veronica pulled me in her office and showed us three different kinds of procedures claiming that this is a better path, in reality she changed the ammount that I was going to be charged from $207 to $400 from $40 to $78; yes she almost double the prices without even mentioning a thing. The day I signed the contract I didn't get a copy or the broken down estimate. Just don't go there if you don't want to be scammed.

It's been about two months since my visit to this place and I'm still having problems with them, the credit accounts that they open have a different last name, different address, different phone number. This means they couldn't find my account although it did go to my credit report.

The office that opens my accounts can't fix any of this because they're not me but they do have the ability to open an account without my permission. I call corporate and they tell me they can't guarantee anything because it's not their authority but they'll try. I didn't have to go through any of this and it's just stressing seriously don't visit westcoast dental, there's a reason why they have nothing but bad reviews I just wish I had researched them BEFORE i gave them a visit.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Worst Experience ever!! I took off work to make my apointment and the manager was so rude. This environment was unprofessional and low budget i felt insulted when they told me they couldnt help me with the pain in my tooth. They asked me to pay over 4,000 for a root canal and a cap for my tooth. I will never go back!!</Text>< Pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>We wanted Chinese but not Panda so we took a chance on China Inn and by the time we finished dinner we decided we'll NEVER go back to Panda!
Our waitress Dorrie was nothing short of awesome! She was fast, helped us decide what to order, even made substitutions for items we preferred. She brought our food out hot and fresh, HUGE PORTIONS! We were starving and did our best to finish it all  but just no way and that was with 2 of us sharing a single combination plate!
Dorrie checked on us regularly, made sure we had everything we wanted, that we were satisfied with our food & offered to go boxes.
Dining here was an awesome experience, we'll definitely be back!< /Review><Response>None</Response><Time>1565584871163< /Time></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Let me clarify the 5 star rating. The service is Amazing, the food is good but not the reason for the 5 star rating. The food is priced reasonably but just ok. If they improved the food I'd frequent this place weekly. Good job to the servers, cooks need to stop just being mediocre.<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Check your tags people I just got charged 8 bucks on top of a 13.99 plate because I asked if I could get pan fried noodles. The waitress was very rude and said that she doesn’t have to tell the customer what she is charging for. Check your tags.</Review>< Pics>

I'm not from here, but I've gone to enough local Chinese restaurants to know that this isn't the real deal in terms of hospitality and service. The fare is good, very flavorful foods that's usual for American-Chinese cuisine. But the service is very wanting. You aren't even offered steamed rice with your order. I wouldn't come back, but I can tell the reader that if you do try this place, the food is yummy enough for that singular visit.<//Review>

Under new management?? We saw the good reviews but something must be wrong.

The Mandarin Chicken was HORRIBLE, and the steamed rice was mushy. The waitress was very nice, but she forgot multiple items and wasn't very punctual. While taking our order she was talking to arriving customers, which was pretty rude. The restaurant needs a cleaning, and while we were there an argument broke out in the kitchen.

I'm glad we're just passing through and will not be returning. It's unfortunate because there are quite allot of good reviews. For us, it was really really really bad.</review>

Food was served quickly. Complimentary soup had no flavor and had a look of like an egg drop with no egg or potatoes that tasted of corn starch.  Egg foo yung was semi tasty with yellow gravy that was not really hot and cooled too quickly. Pork chow mein was missing pork. Loved those crispy noodles.  Fried rice was the best taste on the plate. Egg roll a little too overcooked, but still had crisp vegetables inside wrapped. Missing shrimp although lots of breading.  Service was good, but not exceptional.</review>

<Review>Well,I moved to Tulare ca, from Oakland ca, and being in Oakland California, they have good Chinese food restaurant's in little China town in Oakland California,

SO I missed good old food from Oakland ca, and me also being a Great CHEF, from Bay Area, I tried out food from here, and it have passed test for me,

Tried the green beans sauteed w/shrimp and scallop, broccoli w/beef,chicken fried rice and best wonton noodle soup,just like little China town in Oakland California.

Only waited 20 minutes, little to over service, cause I went when they just had open doors, but for great food like 20 minutes, I would wait again,

Cause I went to couple restaurant in Tulare ca, and, they don't care about there services, or food, and that's more important in Restaurant Business's.

AND I would never return ever to there restaurant ever again.<//Review>< Pictures>

China Inn, BEST Chinese restaurant in Tulare!   Get to meet Tony, the chef, and enjoy the food.   Great quick service, friendly servers, clean, and quiet.  Enjoy your meal and conversation without excessive noise from t.v. sports, no bar, so nice to bring the family.  Request a Chinese dish that may not be on the menu and Tony will do his best to prepare it for you!  We don't even consider eating Chinese food anywhere else.  Five stars all the way! ☆☆☆☆☆<//review>

We Love the China Inn . It beats AG in town any time!! They cook it up fresh you can hear the sizzle. They give you great portions  so you can take home. It is always nice and cool inside. The nice lady that owns the place is sooo nice😊She always remembers what you like. It is well worth the drive cuz   I can fill up at Shell because the gas is always 30-50 cents less than Porterville even tho its the same owners.  What's zoning  got to do with it?<//Text>

Filisha is a talented artist when it comes to cuts and blowouts. Oh, and eyebrow waxing! I walked in looking Covid-19 shabby and in no time at all, I was walking out looking SO good! I feel blessed and lucky that the day before I started my new job, that it was Filisha welcoming me into Hairzoo.< /text>

Clean, nice location. They were practicing social distancing & disinfecting & cleaning between clients which I appreciated. Hand hygiene /sanitizer between clients could be improved. I got a hair trim after many failed attempts of hair stylists going trim happy and cutting off lots of my hair when I just wanted the dead ends cut I finally was able to have a fresh look with just the split ends and the very least to be trimmed. I got the olaplex treatment too, which was nice for smoothing & conditioning the hair.</review><name>Melanie Roxas</name></record>

I always feel at home here.  The minute you walk in your created with helpful and friendly staff. While you wait you are offered a beverage from coffee to mimosas.  You know your in great hands with the stylist at Hairzoo because everything they do is with bride and style. Give them a call today. 🙂</text>

Going through breast cancer journey, my hair which was very long was falling out very quickly. I decided to go here us had had very good ratings and was not disappointed. The hairstylist who took care me was very friendly and supportive in so many ways. I was made to feel very comfortable and able to give a lot of input harder trim my hair so that it falls correctly in place. I let her met the owners to change how I charge something and they were so accommodating, friendly and kind. I look forward to going back for all of my next  ad infinitum . Also,  they are very reasonably priced!!!</Text>

What a disappointment. You turned what was something my daughter was looking forward to into a sad experience.
$41 for a “wash and cut” which lasted no more than 8 minutes.
Antoinette if you were busy and in a hurry you could’ve said so. I wouldn’t have minded rescheduling.
I was called 30min before my appointment asking to come in later than my scheduled appointment because they were busy. I did so and still you rushed us out of there like if we weren’t paying customers.
I will never come back. I have given this place multiple chances. Four of my family members go here but never again.
I might as well cut it at home myself.
Now I’m going home to dry it and see how it looks because you sent us home with wet hair.
Awful experience for a 7 year old girl who was ready to cut her long beautiful hair.
Get better people to work there please.<//text>

<Text>Love this place! I walked in at 9:15 on a Saturday and they greeted me right away and were super friendly. I was ready to wait since I hadn't made an appoitment, but they took me back right away. My stylist was very friendly and gentle with my hair. I truly felt pampered.

I was walking down Wilshire blv on my lunch break decided to stop in for a quick trim. I was greeted by the most gorgeous woman with blond hair and blue eyes immediately who goes by the name Antoinette, She offered me somthing to drink and wasted no time getting me in the chair, me cut was amazing and the conversation was phenomenal,  I have never felt like I was speaking to an old friend when just meeting a person until today.
I WILL DEFINITELY BE RETUENING AND ASKING FOR ANTOINETTE AGAIN<//text>

Revised to 2 stars: used to be a big fan, but the entire staff / management seems to have turned over and despite making appointments, I've had to wait 30+ minutes the last two times I've come in. Quality has dropped significantly across the board, will be giving other places a try.

Revised review (down from 5 stars): I just came in for a haircut, typically love this place. Was told wait would be 15 minutes, an hour later I got called up and the girl who cut my hair couldn’t look less interested. Haircut lasted approximately 10 minutes, she spent the entire time looking towards the door every 20 seconds. And never bothered to just do a quick blow dry before putting product in my hair and sending me out with soaked, sticky hair with all the cuttings still in.

Not coming back.</Text>

Beware. They do not honor appointment times, so you may be in the same boat as me, on your way over to get your haircut but getting a text 20 mins before my appointment saying actually I can’t be seen for 2 hours after my original appointment time. Staff did not care.< /Review>

My daughter and I went for a blowout and curls for my son's  wedding.  The girl acted like she had never even held a curling iron before. She had to borrow a curling iron.  She should have asked for instructions too.  I left in tears - almost.  My daughters hair turned out fine, done by someone else of course.< /Text>

LOVE HAIRZOO! I'm crazy busy being a business owner, Mom, and wife, so finding time on my calendar to make an appointment weeks out is impossible. Hairzoo lets me walk-in and they do the rest. I mean come on, walk-in for a color and cut? That's unheard of! It's my "me" time, to relax and enjoy getting pampered. Love going in for a Blowout before a business meeting or a wedding. The staff is friendly and they always give me exactly what I want, if not better! It's always clean and the fact they offer drinks is just the cherry on top! You can't beat the price. I was used to paying a small fortune for my balayage and cut at an another salon, now I pay a fraction and get the same experience and quality. Even my 5-year-old loves it there. They are really patient with her and make it a fun experience. Can't have enough great things about Hairzoo. Seriously give them a try, you won't regret it.<//review>

I love coming here. I live on the other side of town but I make it a point to get my haircuts at hairzoo. I have been getting my hair cut here for over a year. I used to come in as a walk in and was always happy with my cuts. I have curly hair and they know how to cut it! Everywhere I would get a cut prior to hairzoo would just cut my hair short no matter what I requested. I now book online before coming, Paola has been cutting my hair recently and she has been giving my my best cuts yet!</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I've never spent much on haircuts and wanted to take it a notch up. My girlfriend went here the other day, so I decided to give it a try as well.

My first impression was booking the haircut appointment online. They have a nice website that allows you to schedule an appointment by stylist, showing all the times a stylist is free. The website was a pleasure to use.

Morgan cut my hair, but before she even started, she offered me a free beer (or other beverage of my choice)! I told her that I wanted to try something new and she offered some suggestions that fit the traits of my hair. Haircut turned out as awesome as the service!< /Text>< Pics>

She took the time to listen to what style I wanted and gave lots of advice to obtain an haircut that suited me better as well as advice on how to style my hair. She has amazing technique and patience. I only have one complaint: I live in Australia! :) But this will be my go-to place whenever I am in Venice/Santa Monica again for sure.

This place was great! I was surprised! I thought a newer salon would have some kinks but gave it a try anyway! Lindy, the salon manger, was amazing! Her level of expertise impressed me!  I went in with an open mind and am sooooo in love with my hair!  I am so glad that I found a regular hair stylist that I can trust!!<//Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I received the worst haircut today. Looking at it in the mirror up close it's uneven and very poorly done. I'm not even a hair stylist and I can tell how bad it is. The stylist was also very stand offish. I paid an extra $10 for a shampoo and they didn't even use conditioner. So I got to feel her pull at my hair the entire cut. She was asking me what sissors to use and when. (She had to go to school right? They dont just let anyone cut hair here right?) I can't believe my overall a poor experience.</text><user>100803656407171213920<//user>< username>

We were the only customers and they made us wait as the stylist chatted.  The haircut was beyond amateur and we had to get it recut the next day. The stylist acted as though she was doing us a favor and had zero skill.  I don't need free coffee but I love the video that constantly plays advertising free Starbucks coffee. No offered us anything and there was none to be seen.   The most disheartening thing about this place is they don't even make an effort to pretend they care.< /Text>< rate>

When Hairzoo opened  in Santa Monica I decided to try. First 2 times it was OK. Unfortunately the girl who did my hair left. For a while I had someone who could not get directions. Decided  to get another person. how lucky I was that TERRY   cut my hair and 2nd time I had Highlight. I was amazed of how professional and knowledgeable she was. You don't see this high class hair dresser in places like Haizoo. I hope she stays if not I will follow her.

Last year I gave Hair Zoo a 5 star review. Unfortunately Terry left and moved to FL. Before leaving she introduced me to Crystal. She gave  me a very good hair cut,but unfortunately she left. I wish I knew where she went.
I visited the saloon twice since then. first time for a hair cut ( BAD ) second time Thanksgiving eve for highlight +hair cut.   I wish you could see my BAD hair cut.
Looks like  that Hair Zoo is not friendly with old persons. They  thinks if  you are old and  have an accent you have no idea about fashion and hair styling. So they don't give you  one of their more knowledgeable  hair dressers.
I am partially disabled and can't drive any more + live alone. Your salon is very convenient for me.I want to add that I am a good tipper.I always tip with cash. I am going to try once again. do you have any suggestion for me?<//review>

< Review>
Absolutely horrible. I just moved into the neighborhood and went there since it was close to me. A girl who has never cut hair in her life, did my haircut. I knew she had no idea what she was doing, so I guided her through the haircut to minimize this disaster. The best part was the manager or a cashier didn't even come to the counter to check me out and let the girl handle everything since I think they were terrified of a serious complaint. To be fair, it wasn't the fault of the person who cut my hair but the people who put her on to it. I don't know if this poor service was because I was a new client or maybe some other reason but it was a true shocker. 28$ on the worst haircut ever, save your money.</Review>

<review>One of the best hair salon's in Los Angeles!!!  I highly recommend Hairzoo. This place is incredible. From the friendly staff that greets you when you walk in the door, to the super talented stylist that gives you exactly what you want, all for an incredible value. Hairzoo is simply awesome!

I'm a clean-cut guy that likes to get my hair done every two weeks. Growing up in LA, I've experienced my fair share of hair salons. This place is numero uno! The environment is comfortable, hip, and relaxing. (It isn't like those other barbershops with the lame posters from the 1980's rock bands everywhere.) Hairzoo has a beautifully decorated interior, great lighting, and really comfortable chairs.

All the hairstylist are super talented and friendly. They listen to your wants, discuss various options, and work with you to get you the perfect look. I was very impressed the first time I had my hair done at Hairzoo. Never have I looked this good.

Also the pricing is wonderful! Far too many salons in LA completely rip people off charging $60 - $70 for a single haircut!  Hairzoo on the other hand offers talented stylists, in a comfortable environment, all for an affordable price. Finally a hair salon that is worth it! I'm so happy Hairzoo opened up here in L.A. Life just got a lot better...</review>< Rate>

I had Brett Semrick as my artist and can easily say that I had an amazing time there. The entire place was very clean and very professional, but were always willing to crack jokes and make you feel comfortable. They also cater to all types, as I was getting my (9th?? Idk) piece in very heavy black and grey, and across from me was a lovely young lady getting a delicate butterfly as her first piece. The pricing was also pretty damn good for the large piece I got. Overall very very happy! Def going back next time I’m in San Diego.<//text>

I have been to many tattoo shops throughout my life. Most of the shops I have been too have had great artist. Occasionally, I stumble across a shop that just impresses me. Remington is one of the shops. I have gotten 5 tattoos from 3 different artist (Terry, Gustavo, and Shannon)  at Remington and I must say every experience has been phenomenal. The artist are professional and show an incredible amount of skill and technique in tattooing.<//Text>

Remington is such a great tattoo parlor. It's full of extremely talented artists, each with their own unique and professional style. It is clear there is a standard for the quality of the tattoos and the artist themselves, and that quality is excellent! I have had multiple visits with Jasmine now, and I have finally found a tattoo artist I trust, appreciate, and really like! I also brought my husband for his first tattoo  he can't get over how amazing it is! Jasmine is not only a fantastic artist, but she's fun, great to chat with, and honest. She is quick but extremely thorough and her tattoos are beautiful. She is gentle as you can be with a needle, and she is very aware of her clients feelings, pausing as needed and constantly communicating. She, like the rest of the staff are amazing artists and run a well oiled machine and give vibrant, lasting tattoos! This shop is amazing and HIGHLY recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</text>

<review>A super rad tat parlor. Located in North Park, its the real deal, and I've look everywhere.... These guys combine new age tech to view their portfolios with the old school tattoo techniques of hand drawing the best art you'll find around. Plus, the guys are super friendly and easy-going.< /review>< username>

I have had 2 of my tattoos done by Jasmine. I absolutely love the way they both came out!  I love what she designs for me based on my  general ideas. I completely trust her to take my big picture and put her own style into it. The colors are so vibrant and the detail is incredible!  Her communication is great and she responds to me so quickly. My tattoos have healed so well and there hasn’t been any fading at all.  I have more tattoos I want and I will definitely be going to Jasmine!</review>

I had an awesome experience at Remington. Terry did my work and in addition to being a very gifted artist, he is patient, professional, and knowledgeable in his field. From his vast experience, he knows what types of tatoos and colors work best and stand the test of time. He covered most of my back with a custom design, and I always get compliments on his incredible work. I sat for 10 hours total, and I have to say he made it as pleasant as possible. Definitely book here if you want an amazing tattoo that will last.< /Review>

I spent as decade looking for someone whose vision and skills I would trust. I found Terry. As you can see from his portfolio his artwork is incredible, he has a unique vision and style, and is very efficient and knowledgeable as a practitioner. Your tattoo will look amazing, and continue to look amazing as it ages. What started as a single moderate size piece continued into a full sleeve, and other pieces followed. I couldn’t be happier. While their I’ve seen the work that other artists were doing and they were all excellent. I watched them turn down work because they wanted the person to be sure of what they were doing, and not take getting ink lightly. All in all a very pro shop with great artists. You can’t go wrong.<//Review>

Jasmine is so incredibly talented. She’s done 2 tattoos on me (more to come!), and I couldn’t be happier with them. Her colors are always so saturated and vibrant, and she pays so much attention to all the details in the tattoo as well. She’s so easy to work with and can create the most beautiful piece out of the simplest ideas. I cannot recommend her enough.<//Review>

I had two tattoos I was looking to cover up. I found Terry's portfolio and I was sold. He was booked out for a year but it was definitely worth the wait. The consultation was great. He actually sketched out the tattoos in front of me which I thought was very cool. I had 8 appointments total. Each one went very well. I could not be more happy with the results. Terry is definitely a great artist.< /text>

First off, Remington Tattoo Shop has the most professional staff that I've met at any tattoo shop. The artists are well trained. Their equipment are well-maintained. Also, they have a high degree of sterility with their methods-including OSHA health compliance.

The quality of their art speaks for itself-brilliant custom designs in color or black and grey. Terry did an amazing job completing two full biomechanical sleeves (wrist-shoulder). When I had a concern with a detail to be changed to my liking, he would adapt and improve the design.

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>I’m currently in the process of having my tattoo done by Terry. I spent a lot of time prior to choosing an artist viewing different work. It was important to me that I chose the right artist because the piece I’m having done is a memorial for my Mom. I’m beyond ecstatic at how the tattoo looks so far and it’s further reassured me that I chose the right artist. I provided Terry with a general idea and he came up with something better then I had expected. He is an extremely talented artist and really aims to make sure his customers are happy. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking to have work done. Thank you Terry!</Text>< username>

< Review>
Jasmine came as a recommendation by a close friend, who had a couple of her tattoos.  When I saw her Instagram, I fell in love with her style.  She did my first big tattoo, was really helpful about healing processes, and very reliable and responsive.  At this point, she's done 2 of my bigger tattoos over the last 3 years.  She is incredibly talented, sweet, and easy to work with. Her designs are flawless- I love her spell tattoos.  At this point, Jasmine has tattooed a handful of my friends, who are all in love with her work. 10/10, would recommend!< /Review>

Terry is a beast. I contacted him for my first tattoo and he made the whole process so comfortable and smooth. If you choose Terry as your artist (congrats for the smart decision) expect the process to go something like this:
1. Send email or call shop about idea and location of tattoo.
2. Put down your deposit to reserve your dates. He is usually booked at least 6 months out.
3. His assistant will confirm and book all sessions in advance with you. Each session will be at least two weeks apart. Full sleeve for example is 8 sessions. Keep that in mind for traveling/holidays, it takes awhile.
4. During your first appointment, Terry will draw the whole tattoo right in front of you. It’s awesome.
5. Watch Terry make your natural skin color disappear at mind bending speeds.
Remington is a shop full of awesome artists and they are all super friendly. This shop isn’t for those wanting a design they found on Pinterest traced on their skin. Not that they wouldn’t do it, but the artists here can all draw and you pay for what you get. Let them draw you something custom no one else will have, you won’t regret it.< /Text>

I've had a quite a few tattoos done by Jasmine at Remington Tattoo and I've recommended her to numerous friends and family members in the past, who have all loved her work.  She responds promptly and is always really involved with you in the process of planning your tattoo.  She's got her own unique personal style to her work which is beautiful but she's also great at working with you to ensure that your final piece ends up the way that you personally envisioned it.  Her prices are great for the quality of her work and I look forward to getting more pieces done by her in the future!< /Text>

Terry, he is the best artist I have ever meet. I have to agree with others, Terry takes the time and sit down, and he draws your art work right in front of you no cut and paste with him. I have been to other high end shops and their artist are stuffy and want to charge you top dollar for average art work. Wish all of my tattoos were done by Terry. Terry is worth the wait.<//review>

I've had 2 pieces that became 1 done by Terry, and going back in December to start a new one. Terry's illustrative style combined with traditional is vivid and colorful and bold that is definitely going to hold for years to come. I came to Terry with a few ideas and a couple references and he brought my vision to life, and for that I can't thank him enough.

Can't recommend Remington enough to anyone who will listen.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa2YUpLFPRiRTU99EWhLSaz4wWBBwOD2OEI8cY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>{'time': 1575314866538, 'text': 'Thank you Mike!

Considering this was my first tattoo, Brandon and everyone else at the shop was very helpful, very passionate about what they do and definitely went out of their way to make sure what I wanted came to light. They accepted with open arms which now a days is very hard to find.

Will be coming back soon to continue the work on my arm and hopefully add more to other places. Thank you Brandon!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>My experience with Terry Ribera - the owner has been really amazing.  I came to him with an idea for a side piece I wanted and he made it come to life with amazing color, design, and amazing attention to detail.  I can't go to another artist moving forward after having someone like him do work.  He's often booked and may take some time to get in, but well worth the wait.<//Review>< GmapID>

<text>I’ve been going to Remington, getting tattoos from Terry since they opened at the old location. This is a 1st class shop. The artists are very clean and do a great job with customers. Some of the artists have wait times but it is well worth it to get quality work done. I can’t give them enough stars. I travel from Texas multiple times a year to get spectacular artwork.
Do your homework and look up the artists and their art. Be respectful when you contact them and they will provide you the better service than most tattoo shops across the US.
Terry Ribera is an awesome artist, I have 2 full sleeves and a chest piece from him. Highly recommended!< /text></record>

Remington is the most well run and professional tattoo establishment I've had the pleasure of getting work done at. Terry did my arm and every appointment was fun and full of good conversation. The work he does is fast, accurate, incredible looking, and built to last a lifetime. It's hard imagining getting a tattoo at my old parlors I used to frequent after getting work done from Terry and John at Remington. I'm sure the other artists are on the same level as well! Check them out!< /review>

Been looking for someone to enhance or cover a wrist tattoo that I had.  Called and spoke with Sarah and she drew up four amazing options for me to choose from.

< Review>
Remington Tattoo Parlor - My artist was Terry Ribera.

let me start off by saying, i got a tattoo cover up done by Terry.

Before even finding Terry and Remington Tattoo, i contacted SEVERAL tattoo artists to see if they could get the job done, what my options were and had many questions about the process in general.. Many emails going unresponsive - never hearing from them, or when the few artists finally did respond (took several weeks), pretty much every artist told me a cover up would not be possible and i would need to do laser removal first. No one wanted to work with me. At that point i had lost hope that this was ever going to be possible.

Then comes my experience with Terry. Frustrated and a little upset that no one wanted to work with me, i had googled something like 'best cover up tattoo artist', seeing as i need to find someone who has a lot of experience with covering tattoos. Google referred me to Remington Tattoo... i looked through Terry's portfolio, loved the art and his work, and i read that the shop specializes in things like this... so i said, ok, lets send a message. This is probably the last bit of hope i had left.

i believe it was literally 1 day later. i received a really lengthy, well composed, very informative and detailed response from Terry. Not only saying he would have no problem doing the cover up, but also went into such detail about the process. Like, deep into the technical details of why he would do XYZ when doing the cover, going into black&grey theory, etc!. I was shocked... every other artist wasn't giving me the time of day, and the various vague responses i got all told me to just laser it off first. Here comes Terry, with this extremely personal, detailed, lengthy  email message, you could immediately tell "this guy loves his job". He took time out of his day to really make me feel comfortable. i didn't hear from an assistance just telling me to come in. He took his personal time, which essentially is what won me over.

And every experience after that was just as professional and great. We met up for the consultation, pre-covid, so he can take a look at my existing tattoo. In person, he was extremely personable, it felt like i was hanging out with an old friend. He was super confident. I brought some example images i found on google for brainstorming and idea sharing. He immediately began drawing right in front of me and came up with a really wicked tattoo idea which i was extremely happy about. Went home that night feeling not like just another customer at a tattoo shop, but as if i had made a friend.

it took us 2 sessions, about 6 hours, Terry works extremely fast and efficient. He gets the ink in and gets you out there, no fooling around. i left with an awesome tattoo, that is a very unique style, and honestly, couldnt have been happier with the overall experience. I have had other tattoo's done before, and i can say, this experience was not like any other. This was the most comfortable and positive experience i have ever had in a tatttoo chair. Even after leaving, and being done, a few texts messages of Terry sharing pictures of the final product and his sincerity about having me as a client... it went a long way in my book... considering, for me, the communication was superb from the very first email, you can tell it was genuine.

the shop was extremely clean, everyone was very nice and professional, and there's really not a bad thing i could say about the shop.... well, other than the drive. I live in Orange County, and going to San Diego was a bit of a trek... but not too bad, that is not the shops fault.

10/10, would recommend Remington and Terry 100%. great experience, great vibes and i will be going back to get more when time, money  and ideas of what to do next allows... Thank you Terry.

<text>I have hired Terry Ribera, the owner of Remington Tattoo, to do the bulk of my two full arm sleeves over the years. He is an excellent artist who listens carefully to your needs, and he plans with you in advance the artwork that you wish to have done. He is patient and thorough, and he does his best to accommodate you with his busy schedule. I will soon be going back to Terry to begin work on two calf sleeves.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpmeG4KeJLpFln2l4Rkv7I_tbkqRwCCxMLPQ7f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

I am so in love with my tattoo from Jasmine at Remington. She has a a very light touch and her pieces are absolutely beautiful. The whole process, from booking to communication about design, to our actual session, was easy and fun. Jasmine was super  chill to hang out with while getting tattooed and the shop decor is rad! You can tell these people are legit artists who take their work very seriously. Highly recommended. Oh and they are right between North and South park! So perfect! Will be back for more.</review>

<Text>Four out of my five tattoos have been done by the very talented Jasmine Worth. You can tell that she is an artist, as each piece was more awe-inspiring than what I had in my mind, when I would ask her to craft me a tattoo.
I always get asked by people if they are new, because the colors have remained so vibrant. I look forward to getting more work done by her.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

In one word AMAZING. In more words, this tattoo parlor as a whole has an amazing vibe as it is run out of converted home in North Park. Each artist has a unique style to fit whatever concept your heart desires.

I’ve been seeing Jasmine Worth for my tattoos for a few years now and wouldn’t go to anyone else. Her neo-traditional style is truly unique and the colors she has are vibrant. If you’re in the mood to chat she will talk to you about almost anything but if you just want to sit and feel those thousands of needles drag across your skin in silence she is cool with that too.

All in all I highly recommend Remington for your tattoo needs and wants as well as Jasmine for the tattoo of your dreams.</Text>

This is the most talented and professional tattoo parlor that I have ever been to. I have got a lot of work done before coming here, but now this is the only place that I will ever go to. Terry is amazing and is well worth the wait. He is extremely fast so do not be intimidated by cost because he move twice as fast sometimes 3 times faster than most artists. He completed both of my side pieces in 6 hours per side and I’m a big dude. Any artist I had before would have taken at least double that amount of time. I cannot promote this shop enough and if you are debating on getting something done from here don’t. These are real tattoo artist for people who want to get real art put on their body for the rest of their life.< /review>

Words can’t describe Terry’s talent and professional as a tattoo artist. I have gone to see Terry for two full sleeve tattoos over the course of a couple years. My most recent sleeve was just finished up a couple months ago and I love it. So many compliments on both sleeves that Terry has done. Even though Terry’s schedule is super booked and busy , he always worked with me and my schedule ( last minute time changes etc). He came in early numerous occasions to accommodate my needs. There is a reason why Terry is booked about a year out, he is the best tattoo artist , PERIOD!! Seriously , if you want a badass tattoo by a badass artist , call Terry. He is well worth the wait! I will be going back for more in the future. Thanks Terry.< /review>

Terry, the owner is awesome. His tattoos are works of art. I have two, both on my ankles. I let him do his artistry after telling him want I wanted. I get numerous  compliments. He did my first one in 2011 & my last one, a full bodied fairy just two months ago. If you want a beautiful tattoo, that is a work of art, GO TO HIM! Thanks Terry, you are wonderful!!  New update, went to Terry just a little over a month ago, just had to get one more tattoo. It is so beautiful. Terry does such wonderful work. He does tattoos in a very sterile manner, so that is never an issue. You want the best, go to Terry at Remington Tattoo Parlor!<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I got the honor and privilege to get my first tattoo with Terry Ribera.  I went with a biomechanical sleeve.  I didn’t know what to expect but, I was pleasantly surprised.  Terry is very professional and easy to talk to.  I didn’t know exactly what I wanted, but I told him what I liked and he just started sketching away on paper.  I was blown away at his thought process and how it all just came together.  The man is a true artist, which is evident by just sitting in the shop.  It’s like an actual art gallery with a lot of throwback memorabilia and his own paintings and artwork.  I am beyond stoked about my sleeve and have already scheduled for my next one!  The wait is about 10-12 months, but if you see his work, you’ll know why!</review>< Pictures>

Let me start off by saying that this has been the most professional, clean and talented tattoo Experience I have been apart of. I was personally tattooed by the shop owner terry and he exceeded all my expectations. I contacted him via email and was responded to promptly.  We worked TOGETHER on my art work and he did a diligent job to make sure I was happy and comfortable with all my art work.  He has a light hand and made the tattooing experience a bearable one (tats are painful it’s part of the process) but he definitely made it an easier experience.  The prices at this shop are not at the low end so if your looking for a cheap deal this place isn’t it. But if you are looking for a real peace of artwork That will literally blow your mind away than this is the place to be. I will definitely be recommending remmington tattoo to all of my friends and family!!< /text>

Terry Ribera is a god among mortal men. He took two arms and a quarter of a back that were already heavily tatted and he designed me a gorgeous cover up that finally captured the story I wanted to tell.

It’s beautiful. The colors still pop a year later. And I get stopped everywhere as people compliment these artful arms.

Not only is the end result great, but his genuine company wasn’t too shabby either. I literally spent 4 hours with Terry every other week for a year and I always looked forward to catching up with him and talking about the dystopian future that awaits humanity. 😂

Seriously, I wouldn’t go anywhere else. I found the only artist I’ll ever need in this guy. 🙌< /Text>

<Text>Thanks for making me a celebrity Terry! People are always stopping me in stores and public places to ask me where I got my tattoos. Worth the wait times ten.

I also wanted to shout out that Jasmine also does great tattoos, we have gotten 3 from her so far and the color work is phenomenal!</Text><Time>1574793864848</Time><user_name>Mandy jouan</user_name><rate>5< /rate></record>

I work with the public so I see people all day long. I get at the minimum 2 complements a day on my art work on my arm. Some even look at it and ask if it was Terry’s work. I proudly say yes , he’s the best!<//review>

Terry and his crew are the most dedicated, hard working, and professional artists around. Working on a half sleeve with Terry and he has been so friendly, informative, and collaborative with my ideas and designs. I understand why all the artists are in demand. The shop itself is clean, comfortable and really home like. I LOVE my experience there. You will too!</Review>

A review should be compelling and convincing enough to lend a significant “word of mouth” draw for someone else to gravitate towards a certain business or entity. Hopefully with this review I accomplish that. Word of mouth is exactly how I was drawn to Remington Tattoo Parlor, specifically Terry. I knew someone who had a full back piece drawn and applied by Terry and was finally ready to get one myself after several years of debating. I contacted Terry via email back in December 2018 to set up a consultation for March 2019. I anticipated full well ahead of time Terry would be a busy artist with appointments booked well in advance throughout the year for large pieces but I knew any wait would be worth it. I brought with me a mere concept in mind to commemorate 10 years since a significant incident happened in my life. As Terry began to draw from scratch and bring my concept to life I knew I was in the right place. The draft of what would eventually morph later into a final product was drawn that day and I had full confidence Terry would later execute the full piece with expert precision. Now I just had to wait until July 2019 for my 1st appointment. As the days drew near Terry completed the final drawing, which I received via email, and I was both blown away and excited to begin. Six sessions later between July and October 2019 , consisting of between 2-3 hours each, and I was proud to display a full Terry Ribera original piece of art. A minor 15-min touch up session at the end of November followed and I again knew I had chosen the right artist. Terry’s vision for every piece he executes is second to none. Despite the (minor) pain I knew each session would entail I so looked forward to them and looking back cannot help but laugh at remembering some of the interesting conversations we had. Terry is just an all around excellent human being and I was lucky to have been able to work with him. The overall atmosphere of the shop was fantastic during each session as everyone was very friendly, professional and just great to be around. I would not hesitate to recommend either Terry or another artist at Remington based on my experiences. I have worked with various people over the years for smaller tattoo pieces I have. But with anything Terry suggested for my piece I merely replied, “I trust you.” I hope my described experience has been compelling enough to put your full trust in either Terry or his fellow artists at Remington for whatever piece you choose, large or small. Because after all is said and done you have to be proud of the piece you were given and I can full well say I am proud to display mine.<//Text>

<Review>Best Tattoo Shop in San Diego

I can proudly say the only tattoo artist that has ever touched my body is Terry Ribera.

Terry did my left arm over the course of about 3 months. We worked together to come up with something I am more than proud to have on me. Everything was very professionally handled from appointment setting, consultation, artwork and the actual tattooing process.

While in the process I also got a chance to talk to and know the other artists at the shop. Every artist at Remington each have a unique passion for art - which is important for me, it tells me they are not fake or just doing it because its the tattoo thing. They actually care about what they do and have a passion for doing it.

Check them out, you won't be disappointed.</Review>< pics>

I have been coming to this shop ever since Alessio has been at Remington. Alessio has been my go to for tattoos ever since I got my first one. He is very professional and is super clean when it comes to designs and quality. I’ve never had any issues with healing or shading or lines of any sort. No complaints and I recommend Alessio to anyone. I have also gotten a couple tattoos from a couple artists who are now at Remington and they are top notch. Remington is the place to be at!</Text>

As an artist, it is refreshing to sit down and watch another artist draw an original price of art based on your ideas, not just copy and pasting clip art on an iPad.  This is what you get when you sit down with an artist at Remington, a comfortable setting where all the artists are friendly, professional, and super talented.</review>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>Walked in a year and a half ago and told Brad what I wanted.  At first, he said it couldn't be done due to the time constraints (I was leaving the country within a months time).  I set the appointment anyway and when I came back in, to my surprise, he said he was able to do what I asked.  I let him do his thing and was blown away.  I went back 9 months later, as I was visiting and had him do a custom piece, and was again, blown away.

The fact that he had done some research on the Koala, to get it just right was awesome.  I've seen everyone's work there and they're all great at their craft!  I've seen Terry doing big body pieces and the other's doing work as well.  Amazing place.

I also like that every time that I walk into Remington, the artists are working on another piece, or sketching or painting; really honing their craft as tattoo artists.  It says a lot.

They even recommended some artists out here in the Netherlands, and now I've got some more ink my body thanks to the awesome recommendation.   Super legit tattoo studio!< /Text></record>

I cannot overstate the professionalism of the staff, the cleanliness of the shop, and the quality of the work done at Remington. I had work done by Nathaniel Gann, who was very welcoming and worked with my ideas to create a piece of exceptional quality. The tattoo far surpassed my expectations and any doubts I had about tattoos were thrown out the window. If (or when) I decide on another tattoo I would without question return to Nathaniel Gann and Remington.< /Text>

Total jerk on the phone.

He disrespected a Chief Arson Investigator with 22 years Fire Service.

Wounded in the Line of Duty, couldn't answer a simple question for me,

then kept saying, " for the third time I'm telling you"...

Well excuse me for not knowing the process.

I've never had a tattoo and was advised by their ad on the internet...

"Call Us, we'll take your questions on the phone".

Liar and Idiot.</review>

Wow so quick and easy. Called to check availability and they had exactly what I was looking for. Arrived at Cube Smart and the whole process was done in less than 20 minutes. And what’s also awesome is that they have an app where i can pay monthly and also have all my account info. Thanks great customer service on phone and at rental location.<//Text>

3 Break ins , thefts from vehicles, fences being broken into, and the District Manager Andrew Olea will not respond!!!   The ladies/managers who work this storage facility have requested cameras multiple times and Andrew is no where to be found. I have called and left multiple messages offering to pay for the camera system myself. I get no returned calls.
How many vehicles have to be broken into before you put up cameras Andrew??
If you value your goods and don't want your vehicle broken into I advise stay away
11/28/2 update: there have been multiple break in attempts last night, my trailer included, damaging the trailer all over as they tried to pry their way in.
Update 12/1/20.  My RV and another Rv were both attempted to be stolen, they crashed the rvs and didn’t make it out . Now I have a totally damaged RV. Thanks cube smart for having no patrol, security, or security cameras . You guys are the best.
12/3/20 whole RV was stolen from this location. Over 50k gone before i could get enough time off work to put in a different storage facility. $50,000 cubesmart let walk away from this facility. No cameras, no security, manager nowhere to be found when I call in to ask questions.  They did advise me they will not be renting to me anymore since I dont have a trailer to store there. Thanks again cubesmart</text>

RENTERS BEWARE 70 UNITS BROKEN INTO RECENTLY!!! Mine was one of them. I sent management an email and still have received no response. Bad vibes from older office lady. I feel these recent break ins were an inside job. I don't believe they do things by the book here. And God forbid you happen to be late on ur bill due to a hardship. This spot is money hungry. They demand their payments and are real quick to take ur stuff if you don't pay breaching ur contract. But aren't quick to do sh*t when ur contract saying that they will keep ur belongings safe and on their property ur items are stolen!</review>

Please if you can add something to provide water or a soda machine. The upstairs units without climate control Become very hot on 90°+ weather in Riverside.</review>

I truthfully don’t recommend it here at all! Even the police officer recommend me to move my little stuff that was left over out from there it’s not safe area!</Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< username>

From reservation to check-in, Stephanie has helped make a cross country move of my Parent's personal effects go smoothly and easy! She found me the perfect Climate Controlled Unit! This has been the BEST storage experience ever!!!
The location is perfect and the access to my my "Super Clean" unit couldn't be better!!!
Thank YOU Stephanie for being so professional, knowledgeable and understanding!!! You've made this difficult time so much easier!!!<//Text>

<review>DO NOT RENT HERE!!! Alejandra doesn't do this company any justice. She has been so prejudice towards me from the day I got here. Kicking me out with no type of warnings or anything. Then wants to tell me to be out in ten days when I'm paid up until the 10th of June. And refuses to give me my money or my days ive paid for. Then will only let me in during daytime hours when I'm only Available late afternoon. And I've been here over two years. Never caused any problems what so ever. Its all just racial Profiling at it's very best. Really really sad actual. How this woman keeps her job I will never know.<//review>< user_id>

<text>This is a horrible excuse for a business.  They have no respect for you or your property.  They are very prejudice  and they don't follow the rules or contracts given to u when u arrive. They go off of there feeling not the actual rules. The old woman who works there is the most miserable woman I've ever seen in my life. Not safe it gets broken into all the time and they will do nothing to help u just charge u 15 dollars for a lock.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>So very unsafe!!!! If you cherish your belongings then this is not the place to store them. They get broken into alot. Which im quite sure it's been an inside job. Plus the customer service is truly the worst I've ever seen. Alahandra is the rudest lady ever and breaks all the rules. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>104554017246049680075<//userid><username>Chris Stewart<//username><GmapID>0x80dcb2047fa31f1d:0x4375dd6c7a5d6f12</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The people were pleasant and helpful, and the WOW moment was when they explained the 15% discount was for 6 months, but the price increase would be only 2-5% after that. Not 15% plus 2-5%, just 2-5% from initial rate. That is cool!!!!< /Text>

When we reported this issue they said another costumer brought the rats in and they are now kicked out, but as far as our stuff they didn't want to do anything about reimbursing us. We had to get clothes cleaned and some of our sports memorabilia got chewed threw. We're taking a loss and they can't even discount the bill. What am I paying for every month? Rodents control should fall directly on them. I thought I was paying for a clean storage space. Not a rat infested box. I'm not happy with the service they're providing.</review>< Pics>

My mom and step dads storage as well as a few others had gotten broken into and had stuff stolen. All that was done about this was staff placing a phone call to police when we noticed the brake in. A report was filled but never had any word as to our property or if an arrest ever was made....< /review>

Had my unit broken into, lost thousands of dollars of belongings, many other units had been broken into by the same people, apparently the people had been caught once, police released them and they returned time and time again, obviously no one did anything to prevent them from jumping the fence and taking what they could and walking back out the gate, last I heard they were caught and arrested again, but did not get my belonging back, insurance paid $2000 but still wasn't enough to replace unreplaceable items or the value of them. I'm so sorry I stored here</text>

One of the things when renting a parking space is the comfort of being able to park a vehicle if not how many with enough space at the time that best suits you with a schedule offered by the company and accommodates your needs which due to my case but I did not think that there was a disorder in this cubesmart and little professionalism for part of the manager, the day after paying for my first parking space, they were occupied by another vehicle and the day after, also Saturday and Sunday, Monday, I commented to the manager that in this case, what could Acer do because it was due during out-of-office hours and Who could help me? She answered that the vehicle belonged to another tenant who was looking for it. I was always there. I was really confused with her answer. I told her that I was not going to look for Nobody at nine o'clock at night was not my job and I have been in another rented place and this one in specific and it is nothing personal but there is no good service or professionalism, the company should take attention and correct the bad service of this cubesmart Storage. .

(Original)
Hola mi nombre es Javier juarez estoy en desconforme con el servicio que prestan en este cubesmart la manager es muy poco profecional yo rente un espacio para poner mi troca por que no tengo espacio en donde vivo una de las cosas al rentar un parking space es la comodidad de poder estacionar un vehiculo si no cuantas con espacio suficiente a la hora que mas te convnga con un horario que ofresca la compañia y se acomode atus necesidades el cual due mi caso pero no pense que existia un desorden en este cubesmart y poco profecionalismo por parte de la manager al dia siguiente de pagar mi primer parking space estaban ocupado por otro vehiculo y al dia posterior tambien sabado y domingo el lunes le commente a la manager que en esta casos que podria Acer pues debido que due en horarios fuera de oficina y que quien podria ayudarme Ella contests que el vehiculo era de otro inquilino que lo buscara que siempres estaba ahi yo la verdad confundido con su respuesta le dije que yo no iba a buscar a nadie a Las nueve de la noche no era mi trabajo eh estado en otro lugares rentado y este en especifico y no es nada personal pero no hay bien servicio ni profecionalismo la empresa deberia de tomara atencion y corregir el mal servicio de este cubesmart Storage...</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

I was recommended to Ramos Tire Services due to a nail in my tire. The guys were very nice. The one who helped me did a quick but great job! I also learned how to patch a tire from him!

I would definitely go back to Ramos Tire Services when needed. Great price too!<//Review>

Combo #1: 2 beef tacos with beans and rice. None of the food had much flavor. The refried beans tasted like they were from a can. The taco shells were crunchy but as a whole they were lacking flavor. The red sauce was spicy. So was the green sauce. The Horcheta tasted watered down. This was my first and last visit.< /Text>

Very good food. Very friendly staff. And the red salsa is even slightly spicy, and delicious. I never wait more than ten minutes. If you are in the area, it's a great spot to pop in, and grab a bite. I grab dinner from here at least once a week.<//Review>

This place used to be really good. It's gone down hill these past few years. The burritos are super tiny and barely have any meat in them. Every bite has a huge amount of excess  tortilla. No wonder it always empty now.</Text>

Delicious place of you're craving some of the English pub food! I love the regular fish and chips London combo drenched in vinegar and tartar sauce! There's not too many of these franchises left so if you're in the mood for fish and chips, this is your spot!< /review>

I celebrated my graduation yesterday in this great restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a incredible evening and the place was certainly the reason for the successful celebration. The stuff  collaborated in a sweet style, the cuisine was very good and my guests were extremely  happy. We shall definitely visit again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.</review>

<text>Started to order a two piece fish and chips, but nooo, had to be greedy and went with the 3 piece and struggled.  When you order fish they give you the whole thing . Fish was good as usual nice and flaky.< /text>< rating>

Bomb food. It came out so fresh and hot! Customer service is beyond superb, its like one of those mom and pop places that treats you like family! It's definitely a hidden hot spot in gardena and now is my offical fish spot. Oh and did I mention that it's super affordable too?! 10/10< /Text>

I've been there five or six times only one time was good.
I stop by tonight 4/19/19
7:45 pm
By the time I got home to eat my fish and chips and shrimp it was dry overcooked the guy that was so crispy some of it you couldn't even eat and it had to be the worst french fries I've ever had greasy and over fried .
This will be the last time I will ever go back to that H salt it was a complete waste of my money
I could have got a fish sandwich at McDonald's it was cooked a lot better...

The shrimp that came with it too shrimp will for shrimp all together I bought two orders of each two trees combos I'll tell you the shrimp was worse it was like eating crunchy Cheetos

And I don't mind but they could at least turn the Latin music down so customers could hear fish and chips is supposed to be eager Style not Latin Style maybe that's where everything was burned they thought you were making chicharrones< /text>

I'm from out of town and was so looking forward to trying their famous fish n chips. When I got there I was surprised to see they don't provide tables and chairs for their paying patrons. How can you not provide them? Do you expect people to eat standing up?  No Sir - will not go there again.< /text>

< Review>
Terrible service.  Tried calling to place my order before arriving  (multiple times) and got no answer. Upon arriving, I stood at the counter directly in front of the cashier who never even acknowledged me for 10 minutes while she prepared someone's order. ( At least let me know you'll be helping me when you're finished or something.) So during that 10 minutes I tried calling to see if the phone there was ringing (and it was). I don't get it? The place wasn't even busy. They ignored the phone the whole time I was there. So I kept calling to no avail. I come here often and this was my 1st bad experience. But it was so bad that I couldn't ignore it. The cashier seemed to not care about her job.< /Review>

Horrible customer service. Don't waste your time coming here. We went in here today, my husband had surgery on his eyes and could t see the menu and asked what type of combos they had, he was told "that's not my problem". Is that really how you treat disabled people who are looking to support your business? Well you don't have to worry about us or our friend's or family coming to this establishment again!< /review>

We ordered extra fish and a soda and they didn't add it in the bag. $7.00 ripped off!!! Very incompetent. Horrible customer service too, grumpy girl.</Review>

The employees do not cook the food properly,its the same ingredients just mushy.it's perfect when the Asian woman ( the boss)prepares the fish and chips,  Tonight the fish was not crispy and the fries were under cooked,it was awful! Next time I'll get a refund instead of taking a loss.<//Review>

We drove here after work looking online knowing it close at 9 showed up here at 8:35 the door was locked and then they refuse to let us in to order saying they weren't paid one minute after 9 so they weren't going to stay one minute after 9 so they are closing at 8:35 this is ridiculous I drove and could go to speeding to get here this is some b******* I like the food but I refused to come here ever again the young gentleman who refused her service name was Allen and he didn't care who he called in her what we told him he wasn't working women in after 9 because he was going to get paid after 9 talk about some lazy SOB's< /text>

<review>This is a decent older park. It has tad bark vs. a rubbery ground cover. It has two regular swings, two baby swings. The play structure is best suited for kids 4-5 +. My daughter is almost 2 and she can manage the stairs to the main slides, which are steep, but she's brave. Some other features she just too little for. There's a small slide but it has a rough texture so you don't really slide on it. This is my closest park, so we go here when we are short on time. There is lots of open space around the play area with nice picnic tables. There's no bathrooms. It's clean and kept up.</review><Date>1612969503924</Date>< Resp>

My dog loves to play on the grass at the park - he runs around on his flexi leash. The grass has come back nicely and the park is clean. Although I don't use it the play equipment looks fun and is well maintained.</Review>

I do wish that people would pick up after their dogs - I had my dog there and got tired of picking up other people's dog's mess! If we don't clean up after our dogs the park will soon be "No Dogs Allowed" which would be a shame.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Love walking the trail and exploring the creek.  Kind of crazy the wildlife you find within city limits.</review>

<text>We placed our order today for a Christmas lunch we are hosting. Haven’t actually tried the food yet, so I’ll come back and update afterwards.

The staff is really helpful, and they have some great deals. We ordered the $67 ham and turkey with sides. Makes for an uncomplicated day for us.

It is odd, though, that they can’t guarantee your sides. First come first served on the day you pick up. I’d rather pay in full and be assured all my items are available.

More to come, once we try it!</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2jkYwgkwgfzxfhQvaSG2tmgjbg_feG2YeLS-Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI_wzxFyeiAbaU3HVp_yjHGPVqlzgkvHxIrYrW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNye27dfbrF_nBNhviojAyHjqBzaKCjtlF9D2-u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2VDtyNh3ZwDQNPQnVMJC_xj8ev2lplFKzDTeo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhWcySdQrPA5lBIDXtSS69wOlrnzfjO_q2efNd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

<text>I have been a customer of honeybaked since I can remember and I’ve eaten their food since I was a child. The fact that they will not make you a sandwich during a “holiday“ is disappointing, especially when the store is empty.  As someone who does not celebrate Easter, I didn’t even know what holiday was coming. It’s Monday. The “holiday” it’s not until Sunday. I understand when things are busy and in a crunch how this is necessary and I would not be writing this in that situation; however there were five people behind the counter and someone at the sandwich counter doing nothing. There was one other person pre-ordering a ham. As a frequent customer, there was absolutely no reason to not make me a sandwich. It’s important for a business to be willing to alter rules when there’s clearly the ability to do so. I respect everyone who celebrates Easter however the equal respect should be given to those who do not. Unfortunately, this does change my opinion of this business and I will likely not return because of the value that they place on some customers and not others.< /text>< Rate>

<Review>We have liked Honey Baked Hams for many years and usually will have one or two of them each year.  This year we bought a small one for our Christmas dinner.  It was small because we are keeping our distance during the pandemic.

To get a ham, you will need to order it ahead of time.  To pick it up, the order will stay when it will be available.  we arrived at this place about 2:00 PM on Tuesday and the line to get in the store showed there were about six people in line.  The store is small, and there are other things like deserts available, so the browsing of the people tends to make the line slower than it might be at a less busy time.

Our wait to get took about twenty-minutes to go from waiting in line to placing the ham in the trunk.  Tomorrow, we'll have the ham and it would surprise me if it wasn't just as perfect as we are expecting.

This is small, but nice store.  The people are helpful and pleasant.< /Review>< response>

< Review>
Every year, I usually order 5-6 medium sized ham (Encinitas store) and will gift them to relatives. This year, I have pre-ordered and picked up in store (Encinitas) total of 6 medium half boned ham for Thanksgiving and Christmas. This time, my relatives and I noticed that they are not the same honey baked ham we used to love. The hams were not the Golden Baked sugared ham we used to get in the past. This ham looks old, like a much cheaper, had been frozen, store-bought ham, dark like oven burned, and not what the store advertised as Golden Honey Baked Ham that we used to love. Very disappointed and not worth the money spent. I may not consider buying them again for my family and will definitely not buy for gifting to my relatives during the holidays. Please bring back the real Honey Baked Ham that the store is well known for.<//Review>

All pro! Big line for Thanksgiving hams: moved very quickly even though there were a couple of rookies (always) with last minute purchases. Plus delicious hams and other delights. My fellow customers were pleasant and relaxed; all in all a good experience.</Review>

There were about 100 people in line up and down in front of the store very close. I was very saddened at total disregard for COVID guidelines.

Oh! How I dream of y'alls delectably delicious hams! I love this tiny location located in Encinitas, but our family has been huge fan of Honeybaked Ham since my earliest culinary memories. Especially during holidays and such, though not necessarily always only @ holidays. Now when I have the dutiful honor of buying our hams, I ALWAYS buy an extra just for myself and it's usually gone soon after!<//review>

I did it online, the day before and it was there for pick up the next day. They clearly only had the ordered special sizes available, walk in got the huge ham only. We were a party of 5 so I'm so glad I ordered online and picked up. Had I planned even further out delivery would have been an option with even more food selection combos.<//Review>< Pics>

Mixed thoughts. Their food is good, but when I placed an online order weeks ahead, they told me two days before Christmas that they ran out and I needed to choose something else. Umm.. i already paid ahead of time, how did you run out? You sold it to someone who was just a walk in?? BULLS***... and the customer service lady was rude over the phone! I think it was the Irvine location that screwed me over, but I believe they are all owned by the same people soooo....<//review>

I decided to order a honeybaked ham this year &went back in today to pick it up &get 2 sandwiches.
I downloaded a 3 dollar off coupon from Retail me not to my phone-easy right?So wrong!!
They were training a new employee, Ceasar,a very nice guy who was having trouble with the cash register, so he needed to call the "manager" Selena.
Selena ended up being an incredibly rude employee,she stated we needed a paper coupon.What is this the 50`s?? Everywhere else takes phone coupons & this coupon said in store use & had a bar code.
This was a $3 coupon on a $50.00 sale.
Her attitude was so bad that my husband just wanted to leave.
Employees are the face of a company, it's unfortunate that Selena is working with the public at honeybaked ham.
I know we are only 2 customers, but...
We won't be going back to that store,really,I can buy a good ham almost anywhere.</Review>

<text>Installation crew was very professional, and took time to explain each phase of the window installation.  One window was a little tricky due to the existing frame being out of alignment, but they fixed the problem, and made the new window frame perfectly level in the space provided.  The windows are well made, and add a lot to the house.  We only did five windows, 4 upstairs and 1 downstairs, but I anticipate more projects in the future. Emelio A. and Samuel T. did a superior job.</text>< date>

My experience with this company has been a very good one. I needed to change my front and back doors because they never worked properly. When I called renewal by Andersen of Orange County I was scheduled to get an estimate right away. The estimator showed up on time and he was very professional. His design knowledge helped me make a decision to proceed in purchasing new doors that same day. The installation team Valentin, Andy and Edson showed up on time and they too were very professional. The installation team completed the job in a timely matter and they did outstanding work. They didn’t just replace the door they replaced the frame and all of the trim. All three doors were installed and the job completed in one day. The installation team were very careful and they covered all the areas with plastic prior to starting the job. Their clean up was meticulous. My new doors are beautiful and I’m so happy with my purchase. The product and installation is beautiful. I highly recommend this company.<//Text>

<Review>I ordered new windows, for my entire house. Total of 13 and wow, just wow! They look amazing! The team was super professional and explained everything when they arrived (on time!). On top of that, the project manager Sam T., noticed that I have kids and made a two day job a one day job. Seriously the best customer service. The other team members Anthony and Christian were really patient when my kids had about a thousand questions about their truck and the windows.
The windows look great. We got the rundown on how everything works, and there was even one window that was a little off and the project manager proactively ordered a repair. I’m really happy with the installation and the installation team. The attention to detail, even the personal details, really made this an incredible experience. Thank you Sam, Anthony, and Christian! You’re the best!</Review>< pictures>

Nick, the Project Manager, and his team were on time and worked professionally installing the window over two-day period, cleaning up and vacuuming so that it looked spotless. The windows were beautiful and reduced street noise significantly. Hoping it will reduce heating/cooling costs for years to come!< /review>

The install time took longer than what I was quoted but I planned for it so it was no big deal. Everything was cleaned afterwards and the door is amazing! There was a little problem with the door handle but I am sure it will be resolved. Thank you Igor for your friendly service and prompt responses wherever I emailed.</review><user_name>Staci Robinson</user_name><Time>1618175707556<//Time>< Pictures>

We bought four Renewal by Anderson windows ten years ago and they still look and operate like new, so when we wanted to add some more  windows, we knew we needed to get Renewal by Anderson again. This time we bought eight!!< /review>< pics>

They were very thorough, meticulous, and conscientious. They made it a pleasant and stress-free  experience. I would highly recommend Andersons Windows<//Text>

A guy gave us a quote yesterday.  This is our fourth quote before we move forward on replacing the sliding glass door with a single French door with sidelights.  The guy was very professional but when he said it would take 90 minutes to do his presentation, that was a clue.  The quote was $10,900 to replace one sliding glass door.  Keep in mind this is a simple door swap and there is no construction.  It takes a professional half a day to hang it correctly.  The other quotes came in between $3800 and $5200.  I was told by them that they make their own products and it’s a solid composite material instead of hollow vinyl.  That really doesn’t matter if every other product in my house is also a vinyl door or window and they are holding up well after ten years.  And that’s also what warranties are for.  They sell a lot in Palm Springs and Orange County where people with money don’t know better.  And I can’t imagine their profit margin being less than 60% with a price like 11k.  So no I would not recommend them.< /Text>

He was on time, listened to my concerns, and was respectful while inside my home. He thoroughly addressed the concerns and gave us a very comprehensive report at the end.

I love this company,  they NEVER let you down.  The windows and doors are amazing, silent, clean and pretty.  From the sales, customer service all the way to the installation employees which no one ever disappoints.  Also Clean, friendly, and very good at making your experience a perfect one.  The clean up after themselves and today even cleaned up the ashes from the wind and fire.    If i could give them a 11 i would.</text>

Although nice people, the sell speech was way too long and not relevant for my needs. After an hour of talk and multiple requests for specific details, I had to ask these folks to leave because we just weren’t getting anywhere. Additionally, they gave me a list of houses they serviced recently and my address was on there and yet we were not able to locate any of their work in my house - that didn’t sit well with me.</text>

We had Renewal by Anderson out to swap out a couple of window sash’s. John G. was punctual, professional, and did an outstanding job. He swapped  out the sash’s, cleaned the windows, and made sure I knew how to operate the windows in order to clean them from inside the house without removing the screens! Very informative and great customer service. Thank you John G.!!</Review>

After many years, we decided to replace our aging and inefficient windows. We selected RBA for their quality and service. During the install, one of the installers noticed a piece was not cut exactly to measurement. I would have never noticed it, but they said quality of work is important to them and it had to be perfect. They installed what they had, reordered a new custom piece, then came back to replace what was not correct. And the icing on the cake? A few days after the fix we received a thank you gift from the company for selecting them. A very thoughtful gesture in this day and age. If you need new windows, I strongly recommend RBA. You will be glad you made the choice.</text>

Renewal by Andersen did a fantastic job replacing my windows in the front. From the initial consultation to the measure to the actual install, I’ve been very impressed with everyone professionalism. If they say they will be there between 830 and 930, they arrive at 845, and I really appreciate that. I have been impressed from start to finish and will definitely be using them for the rest of the windows in my house.< /review>

The installers were prompt,courteous, and professional. They wore masks per Covid-19 protocols. We were amazed at how quickly they were able to install the windows. Installers also  cleaned up the areas around every window such that you would never have known they were just installed. The customer service was excellent even when we had to reschedule the installation of one window and the inspection. The windows look better installed then expected. We are very satisfied.< /text>

I don’t understand how difficult it is to schedule an appointment for an estimate. Spoke to a guy by the name of Joel for over 10mins. It felt like he worked for the Census bureau. Asking way too many unnecessary questions.  I understand if you want to have some basic questions such as how many doors you need. How many levels. Etc. but asking how many people are in a household, are you the owner, what’s the name and contact of the HoA, what is your house sq footage. Seriously are they are trying to ask this type of questions just to get an estimate or are you guys the FBI? You guys are ridiculous.<//Text>

Sevice was very easy and timely... Zach was the technician that came to our home and was very nice and professional. He explained what was needed and easily made the repair ... he made me feel completely comfortable being in our home and wore a mask the entire time. His customer service skills are exceptional! I want to thank renewal by Andersen for their prompt response to my service call. My experience with all of their staffs has always been positive and they are true professionals in their business! - Charles Barker< /Review>

We had these Renewal By Andersen windows installed two day ago and what an incredible difference. Sound insulating is unbelievable and the R value insulating is fantastic as well. The crew was professional and all business. Refugio ran the show and nine installers showed up day one at 8am. They immediately started putting up plastic dust protection and laying down floor runners they had our 15 windows removed and reinstalled on the first day and only three of had to come the following day for about two hours to finish up the trim and caulking on two of the windows. Kudos to Greg, Allen, Chris and Edgar but the whole crew was great.  I have a bit of touch up paint to do but well worth it. We had wanted to do this for several years and finally bit the bullet and pulled the trigger and we couldn't be happier with Andersen.< /review>

The installers prepared the work area bye covering the floors and furniture.  Upon completion of the work performed the protective materials were removed and vacuumed the work area.  The installers were kind, pleasant and efficient, completing their task in a timely manner.

Our experience with Renewal by Anderson’s associates/materials  have been very good.  We look forward to our next home improvement project with your company.

Everyone from the salesman on down was very professional and helpful. All appointments were kept and on time. Time was taken by all involved to not only explain but show us the differences between their product and others. These windows and doors not only look beautiful, but I could tell the difference in the amount of heat and air coming through the old windows (tons) compared to the new ones (slim to non) right away. I can actually work from home comfortably. There was not one part of this experience that wasn’t pleasurable! Kudos to ALL of the team members on this one! 26 windows a slider door and a front door in 4 days! AMAZING!!!!!

Lead project manager David Delgado and his team
Refugii Navarro, Jose Duenas, Tony Vargas, Everesrdo Rivas, Chris Viero, Chris Mandrosan, David Delgado, and Carmen Ramon, you all were rock stars! Thank you, thank you, thank you!</text>

My wife and I selected Renewel by Andersen to replace all the windows in our home. The task was large and we expected multiple days of construction, noise and displacement, in our home. Bernardo S., Julio O., Marcos H., Max J. and Vicente M., arrived on  on time Monday morning and were ready to conquer the task at hand. They were very polite, hard working and attentive to any needs or questions we had for them. They completed the job in two days! Any item which had to be moved out of place was put back, they thoroughly cleaned behind themselves and did an outstanding job with the window installation! We were given demonstrations on how to operate, disassemble and maintain the windows. The crew and company were very professional throughout all of our dealings. We are extremely pleased with the finished results and the product provided by the company and their installers!</review>

What an experience! The professionalism the crew (Ever, Sam, Alan, and Joe) had was top notch. The kindness they showed and patience when I had questions really showed they cared and took pride about and in the work being done. They had such respect for our home, and every night after the job was done it was as if no one was ever here. It was very hot and they showed up early everyday and put in an honest days work and ensured the project was running smoothly. RBA is costly, but the product and installation crew is worth every penny. With a crew like ours I would do it all over. We felt like we were saying goodbye to family when they left. There are no words to describe the joy brought to our home. Excellent work! Well done crew!! We send a big heartfelt Thank you!!!!

They deserve a big raise/bonus!!< /text>

< Review>
Replaced two windows and a sliding door in my home.  I could not have been happier with the excellent service from all sales, customer service, installation and follow-up personnel.  This is some team of experts and each one is a perfectionist.  Maybe a bit more expensive but the solid, quality product, workmanship and professional installation makes it worth the extra.  And they willingly and promptly come back for any corrections, problems, or adjustments after job is done. If I need any additional window replacements in the future, this is definitely my "go-to" source.< /Review>

Today 5/12 I had a follow up visit to check out the smoothness of the new slider screen just installed the past week. They were great  but we thought they maybe could slide a little smoother. Anderson sent out one of their Techs Dan H. the very next day. Like the five man crew that installed my windows the prior week,  Dan was on time, very pleasant and knew exactly what to adjust on both slider door screens to make them glide perfectly. He went on to take the time to explain the locking mechanism on the sliders. He answer my wife's questions  and was not in a hurry to leave till we were satisfied. Like Oscar G, Josh U , Tony V, Alan R., and Max who installed our windows, Dan took great care and pride in his work for us. Great job guys !!!</Text>

Excellent service from Dan H. and Zack S.   Arrived promptly as scheduled, introduced self, had mask on, very polite and respectful of our home.   I felt confident in their knowledge of our particular windows and even gave me helpful tips in the care of the moving mechanisms.   They represent your company very well.<//Text>

They have a good product but they are so busy that they can't keep up with their installation schedule. They finished 7/8 of the job and now it's been 2 weeks and they're not back to finish the job completely. Very, very disappointed. ☹️< /review>

The entire process was very easy! We waited for our windows to be built but everything else went very quickly. Steven N, Johnathan, and Isaak installed 3 big windows and a slider all in one day! We love our new windows!</Review>

I bought windows and sliders back in 2008. Recently, one of the screen doors wasn't closing easily. I called to set up an appointment and got one the next business day. Dan showed up on time and was very respectful by wearing a mask in my home. He fixed my screen door quickly. I mentioned the lock wasn't working so well. He looked at it and fixed that too.
We made a good choice with this company. They stand by their product. We have only had to call twice in 12 years and both times, getting the issue fixed has been easy.</text>

<Text>Andy, Jonathan and Fernando were great with installation and finish work. They represent the company very well and were very focused on best work and clean up after work was complete. I love the look of the product. Once I committed to the work, the entire was handled with professionalism at every point of contact. Great communication process. Prices are higher when considering value the overall result is best value in my opinion.

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We recently had Anderson Renewal remove one window and replace 11 windows in our 1928 cottage. Valentin and his crew (Brnie, Christian F, Dennis, Alfredo, Jonathan P, and Jose) were polite, professional and kept us up to date with everything they did over the course of the two day installation. Being an older home, there were some unknown challenges that the crew overcame easily. They did beautiful work and we would be happy to have them back should we choose to replace more windows.<//Review>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Just got my casement window lever fixed by John G.  at Renewal by Anderson today.  He did such a great job, not only did he fix the lockbar, but he changed out the weather stripping that fell off and also spruced up my other casement window by tightening some hinges, and added lubricant so that it worked even better.  It was such a welcome treat to get those extra perks.  Thanks so much John G!    I wish I had called their service line sooner for maintenance on my windows.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Sam and Joseph could not have been more professional. Cleaned up all the areas they worked in and explained the installation process. They told me what time the job would be completed when they arrived and they were on time! Anderson Windows should be very proud of these employees. They caught an overlooked detail to a window in the bathroom. The window is in the shower and obviously having a sill would not work properly. Sam explained and took care of installing correctly. Wonderful job!! I am looking forward to having the next set done sooner than later! Thank you Anderson Windows.< /Review>< gmapID>

Starting with our first meeting with Carlos from the sales team to the very professional installation done by Oscar, Josh, Tony, Max and Arturo. Everyone we came in contact with were friendly, knowledgeable and respectful of our home and time. Our windows turned out beautiful, and are very high quality.< /Text>< user>

Our design consultant, Deanna, was terrific - I will admit, I was not on board for this window replacement project, but my family was quite keen on the energy efficient windows, and persuaded me to attend this appointment. Deanna was quite knowledgeable, and by the time she was finished , I was excited for this project.  Her enthusiasm really helped me to decide, and I look forward to the having the windows and sliding glass doors installed in 6 weeks.< /Text>

As far as the replacement and Installation of our living room window, it went absolutely great. The two technicians made sure they did all the prep work to ensure our furniture and floors were not damaged. They also took extra time during the installation to make it a perfect fit.

<review>I made this second consult 3 weeks ago for today at 10 am and no one showed. I had credit card in hand ready to go forward with my new windows and decided to give Renew by Anderson a second shot. The first time I had them out they quoted me over $20.000 for my 925 square foot loft townhome. That would of been for a small bath window, garden window and a living room tall sliding door.
So after no one showed up, I called and spoke with a gentleman that said they tried to call me. I said no not one call came in. He then quotes me an old phone number from 9 years ago. I explained to him when I made the appointment with a lady, she supposedly was suppose to update my number well at least she said she did. I had told her to delete that old number after giving her my updated phone number, which she said she did delete old Number. I thanked her and hung up. If a company is this irresponsible then they will be when installing my windows.

<review>Great experience with window and sliding door installation. Very high quality windows and doors, which were ready when quoted about 6 weeks later. Tim was very helpful with picking door and window style and preparing the quote and explaining finance options. Installation went smoothly and Vicente and crew were very professional, locked up when they were done, and even took care that my cats did not escape while they were working.< /review><Time>1577818727898<//Time><gmap_id>0x80dce87a78a1c3d3:0xbde68f73f1075fe1</gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>Just received a replacement screen for one of our Renewal by Andersen windows. Immediately after the windows were installed, my husband put his crowbar through the screen while doing a wall repair. Renewals by Andersen replaced the screen at no charge!
The screen came quickly, and Dan not only took care of the new screen, but removed the broken one and took it and the big cardboard box with him as he left. He was so quick and so polite too! Thank you Dan, and thanks to Renewal by Andersen for being such a pleasure to work with!

<text>I didn't buy my windows from the Orange office but I wanted to say that these are the best. You pay more but it's worth it. We had ours installed about 15 years ago and we have had no problems at all with them. They look so nice and work as they should. I am not getting paid to say this just giving my review of the product. We had 9 windows replaced. Well worth the money.< /text><Date>1581440437605<//Date>< rating>

<review>Today we had 3 windows replaced by Valentin Ramirez and Cristian Mongragon from Renewal by Anderson of Orange County.  They kept us informed throughout the process of installing our window replacements.  They encountered a few problems with old windows and solved them with good   alternatives.  All of our furniture was covered with plastic and carpets were covered as well.  Both were respectful of our property and cleaned up beautifully when they were finished.  We are definitely satisfied with the customer service received and would recommend them (especially!).<//review>< Resp>

<Text>Very satisfied with Dan H. and Renewal by Anderson!  Many years ago I had my windows replaced, and just recently noticed some exterior weather stripping was showing signs of dry rot on my kitchen bay window.  Dan H. explained how that older type of weather stripping is no longer used, and it would be replaced free within warranty.  Also, I had a broken sprinkler cause water damage to a wooden cornel underneath a very large bay window in my living room.  Dan H. replaced both corbels for a very reasonable price.  I never worry about my windows and doors knowing I can always get professional support from Renewal by Anderson< /Text><GmapID>0x80dce87a78a1c3d3:0xbde68f73f1075fe1< /GmapID>< Time>

Renewal by Andersen continues to be the best contractor that I’ve ever used. Zach came out to replace one of our bathroom windows under warranty and couldn’t have been more professional. He like the rest of their organization was first class. It’s great dealing with a company that backs up their product.</Text>

I had windows installed a few years ago and just completed my 2nd project with a brand new door.  Dan H. was part of both projects.
He was to my home today under a warranty service call.  I have to commend Renewal by Andersen for having service techs who exemplify the company's vision and standards.  Dan was on time, was friendly and courteous, and had everything with him to make this call go smoothly and efficiently.  And in this day and age of never knowing who will be at your home, it was a pleasure to greet someone who has been to my home previously.  Thank you Dan.</review>

I want to give a shout out to Andy and his partner for doing such an excellent job putting up this beautiful sliding door. They worked with extreme care.  And since I am particular about painting, I want to say thank you to Fernando who came and did such a wonderful job painting the door and blending it in a way that resembles one that has been spray painted.  There were absolutely no brush marks!  I highly recommend renewal by Andersen, a job well done!< /review>

He was really good and efficient. Dan had finished early at a previous job and was able to come to our appointment sooner then expected, he called and asked if that would work and it did! Dan took the time to check another area I had concerns about. Dan was also really good about adapting the installation since it was extremely windy in our area, he found a easy way to install it from inside safely.
It was done quickly which I appreciate since I have a curious toddler running around.

Dan H just came and replaced my defective sliding door. He did a great job, the door looks and works great.
My issue with this company is the lack of  Communication with me the customer. The first door they installed was defective and they tried to repair it once. It was decided the door needed to be replaced. Everything was good up to this point. I did not get a call with a timeline on how long this would take. So when I called to see what was happening and to complain  about the lack of communication. I was told a manager or possibly the owner would give me a call back with an explanation. I was never called back. After several weeks went bye I called back I was told I was going to get a  partial refund for my trouble.  I was also given the date of September 25 on when the new door would arrive to their shop. They would call me at that time to set up an appointment with me to install the new door. They called me several weeks after that date to set up appointment to install the door. Just not happy with the lack of communication especially with a customer who is having this king of trouble.
All of the installers and repair of people or excellent just not happy with the front office</text>

The worker who came to replace the glass because it had a defect in it, was so quiet and efficient, I hardly knew he was there.  I  was very impressed watching him remove the glass and insert the new.  I would give these workers all an A++.    Van Doren family< /review>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Earlier this year Renewal by Andersen installed some beautiful French Doors. One of the handles worked its way loose recently. Called them up and they immediately sent someone out to fix it free of charge. The guy they sent was John G. and he was great. Took him about 20 seconds to fix it, and then he also took a minute to explain exactly what he had done so that I could understand it, which I really appreciated. Continue to love this company. They really care about their customers and they hire great people.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>We had Andersen replacing our sliding patio door (95”x95”) and the company delivered and executed as promised. Josh and David did a great job installing the “big thing” and Dan H and Fidel a perfect job with the fine tuning afterwards. What we like about the company is that it every step is perfectly executed from A-Z.< /Text></record>

<Review>I had two windows with issues on opening and closing. John G. arrived on time. He was friendly and professional. One window had a broken lock. John G. knew what the issue was immediately. He explained what he was doing all the way. The second window had a different problem, but he made that adjustment easily as well. He also taught me a better way opening the outer pane.

John G. set my mind at ease about the windows. He was fast at the work while being quite personable.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1571955495194, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to share your experience, Susan!

<review>Sam T and Andy V are awesome!!!I loved the first installers David and Issac but these two...well they are just WOW They finished up the installation of our windows today in a professional and timely manner. As a business owner I know the value of representation and reputation. RBA excels at both.  I knew I was getting A quality window product but what I considered the upmost value of this experience was the customer relations and service that RBA provides. Sam and Andy are friendly and took the time to answer my questions and did a fantastic job. From start to finish the most impressive asset in your company are the employees.. You sales representative schedulers EVERYONE involved are nothing short of incredible. Finding this caliber of employees is rare...installers like Sam and Andy.. well they honestly are a huge part of why this company has been so successful. I absolutely loved our experience with RBA and for once I felt like I got much more that what I paid for. I would be honored to recommend RBA to everybody I know. Great windows...great experience ...

Our appointment was between 11:00 and 1:00. John G. arrived around 11:30 which we appreciated. He was friendly and knowledgeable about the issue. He got right to work and explained what he was doing. He had both windows fixed in no time and we have the rest of the day to take care of other things. He drove quite a distance for what turned out to be a quick fix. We appreciate the quality of people you hire and we Love our windows.

<Text>We've installed Renewal by Andersen windows in two of our homes, and remain impressed with the quality, the beauty, and the functioning of our windows. Recently we required service and repair for two of our casement windows. Our technician, Dan, did a fabulous job. He was prompt, took care of the problems efficiently, and left everything tidy and clean. He was everything we've come to expect from Andersen! I highly recommend him and his work. Thanks, Dan!</Text>< user_id>

<Review>Our home was built in 1960, with original Anderson windows. Not an easy job. The crew of Richard, Juan, Luis E., Tony, and Jonathan P. arrived on time and each one introduced themselves and got to work. They were professional, polite, personable and friendly to us and each other. They worked as a team and everybody had something to do. No one was idle. On the first day they worked until almost 8 p.m. A special thank you to Richard and Michael who were knowledgeable and great trouble shooters. We would highly  recommend this company and this crew to anyone who asks about our experience with them.

If you are planning on replacing your windows, Renewal by Anderson is an excellent company. All of the products are very high quality, as well as their installations. Customer service is also very efficient.

We have had a couple of follow up visits for additional items, most recently from service technician Dan H. They have always been professional.< /text>

We bought the windows a few years ago and just recently some of the casement windows hardware malfunctioned. Renewal by Andersen stood by their warranty and in just over a week had someone out to fix it. Zach S. came right on time, fixed it quickly and professionally, and left without a mess. Thanks for the service Zach.</Text>

Everyone from the salesman, to the installs, to the repairman Dan H. is very friendly, helpful and even can help with extra small things. Dan even showed me what product to use to keep my windows operating smoothly. Zack was also kind, knowledgeable and did everything to help me understand each step. Thanks to both.< /review>

He also was right on time and very courteous, and had great attention to detail.  The office staff is always updating me on the next step in the process.

My new windows are beautiful. The install was seamless and both times I needed follow up attention they were prompt and resolved everything immediately. Jake in install sales and John G in follow up care were both amazing. Appointment with John G was set for between 2-330 and he was there at 2! ❤️ I didn’t have to spend the day waiting which I deeply appreciate. AND he fixed my problem.< /review>

We had our windows Installed yesterday October 3rd 2019. They were installed by a team of three Jose the lead, Joseph his assistant and Robert the detail guy. When they came out they greeted me properly introducing themselves and checking out the job. They immediately got to work and worked with precision and a coefficient team. I watch there every move and did not have to tell them how to do there job as I am a builder and very picky about how things are done. Once they had completed Jose showed us how the windows operated and how to remove screens and clean windows. We did the paperwork and he said they would send us a form to fill as a review. Most places push you to give them good ratings but they did not only asked me to fill it out. They were very friendly and nice to have in our home and even though they ran into problems they fixed them without hesitation and kept me informed of what they were doing.< /Text>

<review>Last year I bit the bullet and had all of the windows and doors replaced by Renewal by Andersen. This is my Airbnb property and returning guests noticed the incredible windows/doors without me saying anything. They look great. They work great. They have sealed out all the cold drafts sneaking through the old windows and doors.
The only issues was there were a few items on a hit list and until Dan Hartzheim came out last week - everything plus some were diligently taken care of.
I would not hesitate to use Renewal by Andersen in the future.</review>< Pics>

Had an appointment for 6:00 tonight with Carlos. He didn't show at 6:00 nor did he call until nearly 6:15. Apparently, his daughter's practice went long. He should have called BEFORE the appointment time. It's now 6:25 and he just showed up. It's now 6:45 and he's now gone. Didn't care for him or his tardiness.

***update*** Heard from the manager this morning in regards to this issue. He was very nice, receptive to the issue and apologetic.

Too bad one employee ruined it for the entire company, for us anyways.< /text>

Oscar G, Luis E, Fidel L, and Marcos H did our install today. The sliding glass door and picture window are great. Oscar and crew were fantastic. Neat, detailed, and personable they are a great crew with an eye for details. Renewal by Anderson products are top notch and they installers to match. We are very pleased with the job they did. We will definitely use them again. Highly recommended!</Text>

I recently had new windows and a new door installed and am thrilled with them.  I had a problem with the lock on the door and contacted the company.  They immediately set up an appointment to have Dan H.come out and fix it for me within a couple of days.  He arrived within the time arranged and knew right away what the problem was and fixed it very quickly.  He was very pleasant and explained it to me.  Iam so happy with this company and their products.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>On September 9, 2019,  Dan  from Renewal by Andersen came to my home to assist me with a problem that I was having with the locking of my two newly installed sliding glass doors done last fall.  I had been very happy with them.  However, there had been 2 instances, while I was away,  that the locks became loose on the 3rd day of checking. This was verified by the Community Police, who were checking my house daily.  I notified Renewal by Andersen.
Dan came out and checked over the status of the locks, which were working well.  However,  I was not locking them correctly nor was I using all of the locks intended  for use.  He gave me a great education on how to use and lock my sliding glass doors from Andersen to stay safe.  I am greatly appreciative.  Safety is my upmost concern!  I thank Dan for explaining it so well!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

We are very pleased with our new patio door/windows. Our installers were Bernardo and Julio. They were on-time, professional, precise in measuring and remeasuring to insure a perfect fit. In short, they are real CRAFTSMEN and not just installers. Great job Bernardo and Julio. Jake Puleo was a great help in taking our order and was always a phone call away to answer our numerous questions.</Review>

Everything about my recent experience with Renewal by Andersen is a class act! Scheduling and confirmation of my appointment including notification of technician arrival makes for best use of my time. The technician, Dan H is a top notch trouble shooter with the "Magic" bay windows. Both windows are back to  brand- new operation.  They cleaned the window glass and even lubed the track of my slider door.  Excellent all the way around. Thank you.<//Review>

5 Fibrex windows and 2 sets of doors were recently installed.  We love them.  Needed a follow up service appointment.  Dan H. was the technician dispatched for the follow up service.  He was professional in appearance and demeanor.  He arrived on time and listened while I described the problem.  Within minutes the problem was resolved.  Thank you Dan H.  Thank you Renewal by Anderson.</text>

<text>Vincente M, Robert R, Kyle S and Edison came to my home today to install two Anderson sliding glass doors. I am extremely pleased with the professionalism, care of my property and job skills displayed by  each of them.  Vincente a was the lead of the project and took great pains to interact with each of his subordinates making sure that they understood their responsibilities providing guidance when and needed, always taking care to make sure that my project was done professionally and to my expectations. He did the these same after the job was completed making sure that all loose ends were completed and that the job site was completely clean and was to my satisfaction.

I'm very happy with the end results and the beauty of my 2 new sliding glass doors. I'm so very pleased with the how the day went and my interaction with Andersen Windows employees.<//text><UserId.>109484805221605468949</UserId.></record>

< Review>
Had Dan H. out to look at our ten year old Renewal by Andersen windows. The windows (which have performed great since their installation) are showing some signs of aesthetic wear on the rails (primarily due to intense sun exposure on that side of the house). He was very friendly and helpful - giving explanations of what causes wear and tear, and how to maintain the windows for maximum durability. It does look like we'll need a professional painter to sand and re-surface the effected areas.  Dan mentioned another client with the same window trim had similar repair work done and he is trying to get me the repair person's contact info.<//Review>

Great service, Dan H was prompt courteous and answered all my questions. He also gave me some great tips to care for my windows appropriately.

Great service!   John G was 5 minutes early I absolutely love that .  he was courteous, kind, willing to answer all my questions and explain how the window worked and why it was not shutting very easily.   He not only replaced the part but he made the necessary adjustments so this won't happen again. Thank you John G for paying attention to the details and being meticulous about your job!

Our experience with Renewal by Anderson of Orange County (RBAOC) was fantastic. There is only one thing better than the product that was installed in our home-the craftsman that performed the work. Christian and his crew, treated our home as if it was theirs. An attention to detail that I have yet to see from any other working group of men. The follow up by the local office was consistent and timely.

The job was completed today with touch up paint and a few mechanical adjustments by Fernando. Polite and eager for us to be delighted, he was a pleasure to have in our home. It is clear that RBAOC values skilled professionals and fosters a culture of customer satisfaction.< /review>

Once again I am convinced we made the right choice when it came to purchasing new window replacements.  Earlier this year we chose Renewal by Anderson. The original job was fantastic and we love, love, love our new windows.  I did however notice a few gaps on a few of the windows interior molding.  I made a call and without question a service call was scheduled. John G. Arrived within the timeframe set for the call and went right to work.  He treated both me and my home with respect. In less than an hour the issue was resolved.  And as with the original installation, you couldn’t even tell anyone was here. Thanks John G. For a job well done.</Review>

The BEST experience! Matt was knowledgeable, personable and very accommodating.  Our installation team Jesus and Fidel arrived on time, were very efficient, professional, pleasant, tidy and hard working.  The windows and sliders look wonderful and can not wait to complete the next phase of installation.We look forward to working with Matt, Jesus and Fidel again! Fernando just finished the touch up-fantastic job. Your employees are the epitome of customer service. Keep up the good work! Thank you!
Completed final phase of window replacement today. Our home looks wonderful. Had a different installation team this time, Richard, Fidel And Mike who were top notch, on time, efficient, professional and a real pleasure to work with. Thank you from a very satisfied customer!< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>We just had 8 sliding glass doors replaced by Renewal by Andersen of Orange County.  The four gentleman who installed our doors were Casey S, Vicente M, Oscar C and Alfredo P.  It was a 3 day job  Our salesman had touted the professionalism of the company so we had high expectations.  Casey was the lead guy.  Very calm and attentive.  The 4 of them didn't say much in those 3 days, they had their rhythm down, each knew exactly what their role was, what needed to be done.  They were very careful to cover furniture with plastic, to set down cloths in the driveway so that our concrete did not get damaged or stained, and when the job was done, they cleaned both inside and outside to do their best to get our home back to what it was before the project.  We paid a premium for our doors but we are very happy with the product, we are very happy with the professionalism of the crew and would be happy to recommend this company.  We've had a week to detail each of our doors and there are some minor tweaks/adjustments that will need to be done but we are confident Renewal will come back to make sure we are 100% satisfied.< /Text>< Pictures>

I bought 3 windows and a sliding glass door. The windows and door are beautiful. The salesman Nima, spent a lot of time helping me choose the product styles and colors and I am very pleased with the final result. The installers David and Eddie were thorough and efficient. They explained everything to me.  They covered all the furniture surrounding their work areas and left everything very clean when the were finished. The touch up painter, Fernando, did excellent work, too. He was also careful, efficient, polite and left his work area very clean. I could not be more pleased with my purchase. This improves the beauty and value of my home. It also improves my energy efficiency. Thanks to everyone at Renewal by Anderson of Orange County for your beautiful products, professional staff and for helping me to improve my home.</Text>

Jesse, Fidel, Valentin and Oscar just left my house after installing two French doors and three windows.  They worked long and hard.  Very respectful. Cleaned up and helped me move furniture around.  The windows and doors look fabulous.  Should have done this sooner!!   In fact, I already contracted to do the balance of the house.  Jim was very helpful and had some good ideas for some challenging areas. Can’t forget Oscar who came to accurately measure for the windows and doors.      In fact, the entire team including Customer Service and scheduling have been great. I am very impressed and happy with Renewal by Anderson.</Review>

< review>
I purchased a beautiful Anderson french patio door from Dial One back in 2006. It has been a great door. Recently, the lock mechanism broke.  I called the number from the Dial One business card attached to my original paperwork and Renewals by Anderson answered the phone. I guess the companies merged or Renewals by Andersen bought Dial One? Anyway, they were able to look up my lifetime warranty from 13 years ago. They sent Dan H out to fix my lock. He arrived promptly, on-time and was able to fix the lock and ordered a new part for the door that also was damaged. He was friendly and professional and got the door working again. I am very pleased with his service and the whole process of their warranty.< /review>

I had some bad luck with the first installers of my replacement windows which required multiple installation trips over six months.  But  Anderson is trying very hard to make up for the repeated aggravation that I experienced.  We are very pleased with the windows themselves: windows are quality material, aesthetically very nice, and the eventual finish was great.  I hope to be able to replace the rest of my windows next year.</Text>< Pictures>

Dan saw the problem which was the door not hung correctly and he adjusted the hinges by shimming which resolved the problem. We are very happy we don’t have to get new door. Dan is a very good representative for your company.</Text>< user>

Jesus and Fidel did an awesome job installing the windows. They went through each window with us (inside and out) to make sure everything was in perfect condition and that we were well educated. I look forward to using them again when we're ready to replace more windows.</review>< user_id>

We had Anderson window installed a longtime ago (over 10yrs) and we had  sash issues on the double hung window. The technician John G. Came and installed them and we had some other issues on other  windows and he fixed them also .He carries materials to fix minor issues for the customers.John was very professional and very nice.Im glad we had Anderson window it was more expensive than other brand but these window frame are more sturdy  I think it will lasts long and now I know that Anderson stand behind  their products. Thank you Anderson and Thank  you

<text>Dan H from Renewal by Anderson came to inspect our new patio door to determine the cause of a small drip leak that occurred during a recent thunderstorm (but not the steady rain we had a week later).  We showed Dan the photos we took of the drip leak. Dan was very thorough inspecting the patio door and its installation, even running water from the hose over the door to help determine the issue.  Unfortunately, that did not reproduce the drip leak and he did not find any issue with the sealant around the frame or the stucco on the house itself.  Dan did give us his contact information and told us to contact him if drip happens again and he will come out the same day to see the issue in person.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

We love our new Andersen window and sliding door!!  The product is wonderful and beautiful and worth every penny.  Our install was pretty painless and so far has gone as promised.  The installers Jesus & Oscar C were professional, courteous, and did an excellent job, thank you both.  We truly appreciated your efforts to minimize the dust and fallout of the project.  Highly recommend Renewal by Andersen OC and their staff.< /Review>

Juan and Christian were at our house bright and early in between the times quoted to us for our window installation! Both employees were very hard workers and professional. They worked diligently ALL day and made sure each installment was properly put into place. We even got a mini lesson on how to take out each part of the window so we can properly clean our second story windows without getting on a ladder. Our house was spotless after they left, which was much appreciated!
Thanks Juan and Christian for the good work!<//text>

We had a wonderful experience from start to finish with the Anderson Windows team.
Oscar G and Marcos H did an excellent job.
Frank D also did an excellent job painting the window frames.
Jason Gonzales was very friendly and professional.
He came by to check that we were happy with the windows.
I would highly recommend Anderson windows.
It's been a pleasure working with everyone.< /Review>

< Review>
I recently upgraded our windows and doors with Renewal by Andersen and I could not be happier.  From the very start with the salesman Matt coming to our house to the scheduling with Jacqueline everyone has been very courteous, patient and professional.  I really am grateful for the whole experience leading up to the installation of our new windows and doors.

At the time of our scheduled install, Oscar G. and Marcos H. were prompt in showing up on time, knowledgeable in the tasks that were ahead, very thorough in explaining in detail what steps were to be taken in the upcoming days, and they both smiled which goes a long way.  Once the jobs were complete the house was clean inside and out.  On the last day, Mike N. showed up to assist and was very helpful, enthusiastic and also very thorough on the tasks he was given.  Mike N. also was very pleasant and smiled which was great.  At the completion of all the replacements Oscar G. explained and showed me how to easily open and close the new windows along with securing the new windows.  The job sites inside the house and outside the house were left very clean.  Oscar G. reminded me of the upcoming projects were going to be scheduled in the upcoming days and they are.  The communication was great during this whole process.

Overall, I am very happy and appreciative of the easy scheduling and install.  I am very pleased and very excited for our new windows and doors and am looking forward to enjoying them for years to come.

Thank you Renewal by Andersen.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>We are extremely pleased with our recent purchase of 4 windows.  The installers (Richard N. and Oscar) arrived on a hot summer day.  It was typical for our hardwood floors to feel warm to the touch if the shades were open; letting light in. Once the install was complete, we closed the windows and immediately realized the reduction in heat permeating the window; cool floors and cool room.  Four windows complete; nine to go :).We certainly appreciate that we are able to complete our project just a few windows at a time.

John G. from Renewal by Andersen in Orange County California did an excellent job fixing several minor issues relating to our Andersen window installation. He was friendly quick and efficient. It was a pleasure dealing with him< /text>

Customer service was spot on with commitment and comprehensive follow through. The craftsmen, Christian A. and Valentine, that installed the doors and windows did the highest quality work paying attention to detail at every phase of the installation. The outcome is amazing! The oak bay window that was installed as part of the job is furniture quality in fit and finish.

<user_name>Ron Mittins</user_name><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>The first of three projects to replace 23 windows and 2 sliders in my home was just completed by Renewal by Andersen. The project was a bit more complicated than a simple remove and install process. The size of two door openings was reduced and three large trapezoid south facing windows were eliminated. That work involved a lot of stucco and drywall work, and I was really concerned about how it would look when completed.

Mason (design consultant) spent a lot of time with me going over all of the design issues and made sure that I was making educated choices.
Two installation crews did the work. The first team (Christian, Refugio, and Marcos) did the bulk of the work. Casey and Joseph finished up the remainder. Frank and Fernando did the touch up work on completion.

Everyone in the office (Lisa and Jacqueline) and the installation crew members have all been very professional and easy to work with.
All work was top notch including the outside contractors that did the stucco and drywall work.

The change in the appearance of my house is fantastic. Phase two is underway, and I can’t wait to get it completed.

Kudos to the entire Andersen team!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Think ‘value’ and ‘white glove’ service. I did the majority of my windows with Renewal in 2009. Had such a great experience then and worry-free windows that are as beautiful now as they were when they were installed, so I called Renewal again. From Matt in sales, Rhys in-office and today’s installation crew of Vincente M., Fidel and Refugio, they are pros, providing top notch service and a fantastic installation job. Very professional crew, careful and tidy - the place is cleaner now than when they arrived this morning. If not for the new windows, you’d never know they were here.  While you can get cheaper windows, I don’t think you can get better windows or a better installation. The warranty is also really good, though you’ll likely never need it. If you’re going to live with the windows longer term, skip vinyl and get windows you’ll enjoy every time you open or close them.</Review>

We had all windows and screens replaced a couple of years ago, and we are very happy with the results.   A screen fell out during a storm, probably due to failure to reinstall properly by a window washer, and we called to have a replacement made and installed.  John G came out and installed the new screen, and took care of a few additional issues such as lubing a bathroom crank and sliding patio doors.  Good job by John G.< /Text>

Our new front door from Renewal by Andersen was installed today.  The door is beautiful and the installation team of Oscar G. and Richard N. did a great job!  The entire work area was well protected and and all dust and debris was cleaned up (probably cleaner than before they started).  We were asked to check the mechanism to make sure everything worked as it should and shown what the touch-up painter would be doing when he arrives.  We are thrilled with our new door and we had none of the hassle of going shopping and finding someone to install the door.  Great work, Renewal by Andersen!< /text>

<review>I am very happy with my new Renewal by Anderson entrance door. Both  Bernardo and Marcos were very careful to move my furniture and wall pictures from possibly getting damaged. Bernardo and Marcos did a very professional and did an excellent job.
Fernando S., came by the next day and he did an excellent job matching the stain to the bottom strip and my existing floor. He was very patient with me because I couldn't make up my mind on the color of stain. He was very helpful and professional, he answered all my questions. I love my new entrance door!  I would highly recommend Renewal by Anderson to anyone.<//review></record></dataset><record>

We decided on Andersen of Orange County because their attention to detail and overall quality.  We had quite a few contractors bid on our project with involved replacing 36 windows, four french and two standard doors and some custom framing.  None of the contractors we interviewed seemed comfortable with the complexity of the project.

In the end, we got what we paid for,  We are very happy we chose Andersen and have recommended them to several friends and neighbors.<//text>

Great all around experience. Mason and Michael were formative and helpful when explaining, selecting, measuring.and ordering our windows.

Their.concern for our furniture and home was above our expectation and their clean up of our house and yard was impressive.  Above and beyond our expectations.

<Review>Yes, the price is at the higher end, but it worth every penny!

From sales through engineering to installation, I have met different people form three divisions of the company, and the professionalism is consistent across the board. Carl (Sales), Dennis (Engineering) are both very details and caring.

The installation team - Jesus and Fidel, are patient, detail oriented and courteous. My house after installation of 3 windows was like nothing happened by all of a sudden a better house.

After all, I don't feel like working with a vendor, instead, a team of family members helped to improve my house. Thank you!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

From the beginning, our sales person Carlos was very professional and worked hard with us to meet our budget goals.  Omar did the measurements, which were perfect.  Richard N and Valitine did the second stage including a new front door, and the results were also perfect.  We are doing the job in stages and the first crew, which installed 4 windows and whose names I cannot recall, were efficient, polite and got the work done quickly and to our satisfaction also.  Renewal by Andersen comes very highly recommended and they did not disappoint.  We have other stages to complete, and our expectations are the same as the work already performed.

<review>John G the service technician sent out by Renewal by Anderson was outstanding. I had a minor problem with a window installed more than ten years ago. John quickly diagnosed the situation and figured out a solution - it took 15 minutes from when he knocked on my door to when he exited. He was very courteous and respected my house while he fixed my problem. This is what I consider to be great customer service!

The installation team of Richard N and Oscar C were great to work with.  The preparation work, the installation of my windows and sliding door and cleanup were done by professionals.  Thank you guys for the great job, I couldn't be more pleased.  Love my windows and patio door.

As an addition, Fernando S came today to make the necessary touch ups to the patio door.  Fernando is very good at his work making sure all the nail holes were completely covered.  Completely satisfied.  He also installed the foot lock on the patio door.

Very satisfied with the project and the professional details to all stages of the project.<//Text>

I must say that, I have been totally shocked by the professionalism and courtesy that this company displays to it's customers.   From the very first contact with the sales rep, to the person who performs the window measurements, to the installers, all have been experts.  I just can't get over the attention to detail that this company requires.  In today's climate, the consumer does not normally receive such quality treatment.  I cannot say enough about how happy my wife and I are with our new 14 windows.  Thank you to Jose I. and Christian V. for a professional installation.< /review>

Our Renewal by Anderson® windows are gorgeous! They surpass our expectations and our installation experts, Oscar G and Richard N, did such a fabulous job. They really know what they are doing.
Oscar and Richard removed our 38-year-old aluminum windows quickly, without damage to any interior finishes, and then began the work of installing our new windows on the same day.
Oscar and Richard did a fabulous job trimming out our new windows; they look like they were part of the original home construction.
Fernando S did a great job on the interior finishing details, painting the trim, and addressing questions we had about the finishes.
During this five-day process Oscar, Richard, and Fernando made sure the floors and furnishings in the house were covered, protected from damage, dust, and debris, and removed all trash at the end if each day.
Before leaving Oscar and Richard demonstrated for us how our new windows function and how to maintain their great appearance.
We are pleased to have such polite, professional, and helpful people working at our home. Thank you all for making this home improvement project a pleasant and stress-free experience!
Michael and Penny M.</text>

This company is the worst Company I ever meet.They send somebody to meet at the house they want $1000for consolation  just so they can charge your card and after that they come back with an Estimate with a higher higher price 4 times more than anybody . Then if you don't go with them they keep the 1000.This is a scam.I have to dispute the credit card company so I can get my money back.They want 19,800 to replace 5 4x5 window Home Depot they charge 3,809.Dont ever give them any credit card until you have the Estimate.Get 3or 4 Estimate before you decide to go with the right company.At the end they want to charge for stucco,Drywall etc.Before the Estimate they said that everything is included.Very despair the guy even come to Long Beach where I worked to get the credit card.I would never recommend this company to anybody.I hope they will never do business in California. Shame on your guys.I will go the Linked Facebook and other site to tell you about your company.Please return Money back ASAPor I will follow multiple Complaine all over the media.</Text>

<response>{'time': 1578157221508, 'text': "Mr. Marinescu, You have your facts quite wrong. On October 3rd, 2019 our representative met with you at your home and gave you an estimate to replace 7 (not 5 as you stated) failed vinyl windows. At that time you said that you did not have time to complete the paperwork so our representative met with you at your workplace on October 8th and you authorized us to begin work on your job and signed a contract for $19,850 and gave us a $1,000 credit card deposit. The work included cutting out the 7 existing vinyl windows and replacing them with new Renewal by Andersen fibrex composite material windows. You also scheduled a tech measurement with our technician for Thursday, October 17th @ 2PM which you did not show up for when our technician arrived and it had to be rescheduled for Friday, October 25th @ 2PM. At that time we did measure the 7 windows and processed your order and placed the order at the factory. On November 4th, you told us that you wanted to delete window #107 and you signed a change order for -$1,141 reducing the amount of your project to $18,709. A week after that, and about 5 weeks after you had signed the contract and gave us the initial $1,000 deposit, you called and said that you didn't want to do the job. Even though our company had invested many hours of time and energy to fulfill our end of the agreement and it was over 5 weeks after the 3 day cancellation date provided for by law, we agreed to refund your $1,000 credit card deposit and we did so on November 12, 2019.  If you are going to post online reviews and put down a person or company, you should at least get your facts right.

Dan from Renewal at Andersen arrived on time for our scheduled service appointment regarding a window latch that needed an adjustment.  The latch had previously been replaced twice so we thought the third latch was breaking as well.  Dan was a very courteous and professional technician and promptly adjusted the latch with no issues.</review>

It's been a very good experience so far working with Anderson Windows and there employees.Very professional, very attending in whatever concern or question you have. They get back to you right away. They just installed 14 windows in my house, looks awesome. Installation crew is very good, I noticed they are very organized and thorough in what they do, definitely know there plan of attack, communicate well. I'm pretty sure all of Renewal By Anderson Windows Installation crews are good but if you get these group of men you will be happy with the job, Oscar G, Alan R, Vicente M, Jonathan P, Refugio & Mike N, Good job guy's.< /Review>

Today i had Richard come out from Renewal by Anderson to fix a minor functional problem on my door handle.  He was professional courteous kind and you could tell took alot of pride in his work , and had a good representation of the company overall.  He was  not hesitant to order a new door handle plate when he saw the adjustment would leave a trace of a scuff mark, he was very careful and paid great attention to detail , and i was ,as usual ,impressed with the company's ability to maintain great customer service long after the sale is over...   Bravo  , Renewal by Anderson</Review>

This is the best company that we have done business with in California.
Bernardo & his crew was of the highest respect for our home.

For the final touchup that was today these two guys was very respectful
and did there job great.  I love the care Bernardo took with his crew.

They did not rush to go to another job and was completed in a very
timely manner. Most all companies have there guys working two
or three jobs at a time, not OC Renewal Windows.

They finish the job and than went to other work, no interruction
on my job.</text>

Windows are an excellent improvement over the single pane ones in our mountain cabin.  Installation by Richard and Oscar was superb.  They communicated what to expect in the installation process and consulted with me over any issues that arose (which were a few in an older mountain cabin). All the windows look great and function well.

I just had a service visit by Dan H. for a lockset.  He fixed the problem quickly and gave me several practical tips for maintaining lock.
I’m impressed with the customer service of this company.< /Text>

The 'Renewal by Anderson' installers -- Richard and Oscar -- were fantastic.
Showed up at expected time and got right to work.
Put great effort into putting down floor protection and draped plastic to protect dust from traveling.
Removed and took old door.
Installed new doors very professionally.
We think they look great.
Custom set of doors that includes large glass and a custom dog door -- it is finished and looks exactly as we had hoped.
Left work site very clean.

Could not be happier.
Would use this group again in a heartbeat.<//review>

Our new windows are beautiful.  The installation crew, the stucco repair guy and the painter all did professional work and cleanup during and after was thorough.  Even our white carpets are still clean.  The following workmen in our crew deserve a reward:  Christian A, Refugio, Marcos, Casey, Valentin, and Fernando S.  The stucco patcher whose name I don’t remember also is included.  Thank you all.  We will be happy to recommend Renewal by Anderson to our friends and neighbors.</Text>

< Review>
Had bedroom windows replaced by Andersen. 2 workers arrived when they said they would. They introduced themselves as Jesus, and Audy. They went right to work. About 2 hours later they were finished. They were professional and courteous. When the work was finished they walked me through the proper way to open, close and maintain the windows. Thanks for the great work. I would recommend Andersen to anyone.< /Review>

With the new Anderson door and windows we can definitely feel that the house is more insulated and more energy saving. Bruce advised us on the different types of products. Ann and Sara were great in coordinating appointments and resolving any issues we had. Casey, Freddie, and Oscar did an excellent job in the installation of the windows and doors. Scott was professional and Frank was amazing in touching up the front door. We had a fantastic experience with them.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< rating>

<Text>We finished installing about fifteen windows (phase2) in our hour house and the work was beautifully done because of the amazing  José I, Joseph Z, and the whole crew (Luis, Christopher, Juan, Arthur, Julio) They were very respectful, knowledgeable, listened to our concerns during the installation, and always careful to protect our furniture and not to make mess. They also left our place clean. I have to add that José did a great job finding a solution to a complicated issue while installing three of the huge windows. He was smart and meticulous in his work, I was very impressed but also appreciative for him to take the time doing the work so everything looked at the end GREAT. The whole crew was amazing. It is very hard to find people who work like that these days. We have met many many workers and contractors from different companies in the last three years while renovating our house but they were not as good and many were just awful.  In fact, all the people, from Renewal by Anderson, who came to our house in phase one and phase two were great.
I have to add that Fernando S. Who came later on to touch up the paint was amazing as well. Also respectful, clean, meticulous, and knowledgeable.
We will for sure ask for José and his crew to come back when we decide to move on to phase three and replacing the rest of the windows. Thank you.< /Text>< user_name>

Recently I  had the patio doors and a front door replaced by Renewal by Anderson, and I couldn’t be happier.  The crew came in protected the furniture and floors they got to work putting in my new doors.  Renewal by Anderson hires the best guys, because these guys new exactly what to do. The crew (Jesus & Valentin) did a fantastic job.  If I had any questions they explained it so I could understand. They always kept there messes cleaned up and the job turned out really great. Everyone at Renewal by Anderson have been really wonderful to work.< /text>

A special thank you to Jose I., Joseph Z. (our installers) and Fernando S. (touch up) who made sure to review every last detail before leaving.  We could not be happier with our french door.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Dan came  to my house to help me with the front door lock on the Andersen Renewal windows. He helped me a great deal to understand the workings of the lock and how to maintain it in the future. He also gave me hints to maintain the exterior of the windows and went far and beyond my expectations in the service call. I would be delighted to do business with people like him every day if they were unavailable – but they’re not. Very impressive!<//text>

In June we met with Matt, a sales representative of Renewal by Andersen Orange County.  His presentation was clear, concise, and detailed to provide the specifics about the differentiation of the Renewal by Andersen product compared to the competition.  The windows were installed and finished today.  Everything--absolutely everything--the company expressed would happen, did happen.  Communications about the install were clear.  Time lines were met with high quality performance.  Rarely does a company exceed their promises, but Renewal by Andersen of Orange County did! Following Matt's presentation, Mike B. came the next day to take the exact measurements.  Jacqueline called with follow up information and updates on our schedule. Our installers were terrific!  Omar and Freddie were on time, professional, and their workmanship was clean and precise. They protected our furniture and carpet.  They maintained a tidy worksite and cleaned everything inside and outside upon departure.  Finally, Frank D. came to paint the moulding today--also excellent. Besides the professionalism and excellence of the product, communications, and workmanship among all members of the team, each and every person was delightful and a pleasure to welcome into our home.  Great job Renewal by Andersen of Orange County.</text>

<review>I really don't see how our crew (Casey, Joseph, and Josh) could have been any more professional. They did a great job on the door and window installation and were very pleasant to work with. They even avoided messing with our nice hardwood casings on the inside of each slider, which made me very happy. Our windows look absolutely beautiful and we couldn't be happier. They even sent Carlos Gutierrez to touch up a couple days later. Everything looks immaculate.< /review>< username>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>My husband I were very impressed by the two men that came to install our windows. Omar and Freddie were very professional and knowledgeable. Any questions or concerns we had were addressed immediately. We also had Fernando come to do the touch up painting in our home. He did a great job!!  He took his time patching and sanding before painting the trim. We highly recommend Renewal by Anderson, Omar, Freddie and Fernando to anyone looking for new windows.  After the job was completed we noticed a couple of places that needed to be caulked. Anderson quickly responded and sent Dan H to make the repairs. He did a great job!!< /Review>< gmapID>

Excellent product and very conscientious installers.

Jesus was the crew leader and was absolutely excellent at leading the crew and keeping the homeowner informed on the status of the project.  He was well informed on the products that he was installing and the process.

The others on the project included Audy and Mike.  Both followed the lead of Jesus and worked well with one another to complete the project on time.  All workers were again well informed on the product and proper installation.< /Text>

Have always had great service from these folks from the day we installed the windows and the few follow ups that ensued. Dan H. explained what the issues were, and the follow up maintenance I can provide to keep the windows and doors functioning well. Three cheers to the crew at Andersen.</Review>

In addition, the professional and courteous technicians, Jesus and Joel were extremely efficient and did a terrific job.  They were in and out in a timely manor with little disruption to our day and the windows look great!!  We are very pleased with the results.  Although the windows are on the expensive side, they are well worth the extra cost for a product that is beautiful and will last.<//review>< response>

A wonderful install job. I've seen hundreds of these in my time. Oscar G. & Marcos H. left the opening and surrounding far better than it was when they got here. Inside and out, the molding is tight, clean. They pointed out shipping damage in the screen though I would not have seen it and put in for the replacement. I'm pleased and impressed. Thank you.

Don H swung by to replace the damaged screen. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the installers and the product. First class all the way.
This coming from an old door hanger with 25 years of seeing it all.</Text>

Jose I and Joseph Z installed our beautiful kitchen windows yesterday.
The fellows worked with hard and did a great job of clean up. I am so proud of my windows.

Today Frankie came by for the touch up job. That looked great too.

Everyone was very careful with our property and surroundings.
Thanks,

<Name>July Burglin<//Name><Review>Renewal by Andersen of Orange County has been the most professional business we have dealt with in years!  Their attention to detail is beyond compare—they are an A+ outfit from start (sales with Jim) to finish (install).  Christian A. and Marco H. installed our windows today and they showed up on time, with on-the-way phone calls.  They made the install look easy and cleaned up nicely.  There is a lot of pride involved with this company and we really appreciate it—that is why we are return customers.  Thank you so much!  Looking forward to dealing with you again in the future!</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Our installation team was Omar and Christian, they did a fabulous job of installation, including a custom curved window.

EDIT.

After more than a year we had a stress crack in one of the windows. Dan H., came out and fixed it up beautifully, at no charge (of course). Happy we got Anderson windows!<//Review><GmapID>0x80dce87a78a1c3d3:0xbde68f73f1075fe1</GmapID><Time>1509058896903< /Time>< username>

< Review>
Our journey with Renewal by Andersen (RBA) started when we decided to replace some old windows.  We have pretty good quality windows throughout the house, except for the living room (previous owner went over reno budget and stopped the project).  Not knowing we have RBA windows, we called other companies that offered vinyl replacement, after viewed their product (we were told we have vinyl windows in the house), we are still not convinced the "vinyl" windows are what we already have in the house.  Then my husband just happened to look at the corner of our daughter's bathroom window and found a mark indicated " Andersen"...  So, we jumped on Google and searched Andersen windows and found RBA Windows.

Called RBA windows, got to see and feel their samples (which felt like the same stuff we already have in the house).  After the sales lady checked our windows and told us that we actually have RBA Windows.  So, even though RBA's quote was much higher than the others we have gotten, but my husband and I felt that it's best to match the rest of the house with the same quality windows, and we are very glad we did.

During measuring appointment, I noticed the weather stip on couple of our older windows (came with the house when we bought it) came out of the track.  Sales lady called on our behalf and started the repair ordr ticket to have those replaced, under warranty!

Throughout the entire process from ordering parts to setting appointment to having the repair technician come out, was exceptional!
On the day of our repair appointment, repair technician Dan H. came well within our appointment time frame and started the work.  He was very polite, his work was very proficient and got the windows repaired very quickly.

My husband and I couldn't be happier with our decision to go with RBA Windows, we definitely got what paid for and more with not only the quality product, but exceptional customer service!!  We highly recommend RBA Windows to anyone who is looking to replace their windows!<//Review>

Previously last year I had my windows replaced by Renewal by Andersen of OC.  They did such a great job with the windows that I decided to have them replace 4 entry doors. They did not disappoint.  The quality of the doors was exceptional and the workmanship of the installers was outstanding. Oscar G, Richard N, and Omar S arrived as scheduled and immediately started the job.  As with the windows, it was clear that these installers take pride in their work. I readily recommend Renewal by Andersen and these installers for any window or door replacement you need.  Renewal by Andersen always schedules an extra day after the work is completed for any clean up/painting work that is needed.  Sure enough after the job was completed yesterday we were informed that the touch up painter would be here today, the day after the job was completed Frank D arrived nice and early to complete the touch up work.  This work included countersinking nails and filling holes and joints as well as painting all trim.  The finished job done by Frank D. was perfect.

Dan H was on time for our service on 8/7/18. Professional, courteous, knowledgeable with Andersen Products. Corrected the issues we had with no problems. Very happy with Dan H and Andersen Windows!

<review>We just had a replacement glass door with glass panels as well as a glass door installed. Both look absolutely fantastic. The workmanship is top notch and is easily noticed by how the doors look. The quality of the doors is high end, and although the price was a bit higher than competitors, it is well worth it. The three gentlemen that installed and completed the job, Vicente, Oscar, and Frank were absolutely a pleasure to work with. They were all very professional and genuinely expressed a desire to deliver great customer service.  I would highly recommend Renewal by Andersen.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Yesterday Dan H. and Freddie, from Renewal by Anderson, replaced a window, repaired a screen, replaced some hardware and added a security protector for our doors. These gentlemen were not only on time but early. They were professional, courteous and made sure everything was clean. It was a pleasure doing business with them. I would definitely use this company again.</Review>

We had a great “easy-peasy” experience with DAN H.
DAN was on time, super polite.   He even took off his shoes before coming into the house (without asking)
Was very thorough on his window inspections and explained everything to us.
Very friendly abut still down to business. I appreciate that he was sensitive to our timeline too
Every experience we’ve had with Anderson Renewal has been extremely professional, clear, and the end results were outstanding!!!</text>

We just had Renewal by Andersen windows installed in our home and I am soooo happy with them.  My old windows by another manufacturer had become so fogged and clouded, that I forgot how wonderful it is to look out through a clear and beautiful window.  Everything looks so crisp and vibrant!
From the moment Jesus and Fidel arrived with the “red carpet” everything went smoothly.  They were professional, friendly, and very knowledgeable.  When they left, there wasn’t one thing for me to clean-up.  I am so impressed with the customer service throughout the project.
We are doing our home is stages and I can’t wait to have Andersen return.  I do plan to request Jesus and Fidel for the next phase.  They are awesome.<//Text>

We hired Renewal by Andersen to replace the sliding doors and all windows for our property.
Everything has been so smooth.  It's been a very conscious process, from the measurement taking to the city permits to be in compliance.
They just completed the first part of the project, which includes the sliding doors, the main entry double door and 3 of the windows.  They look awesome.  They made sure we were pleased with everything they were doing!  They took the time to cover all our furniture and protect the carpet.   The answered every question and even went the extra mile to fulfill our satisfaction!!   Great crew, Casey, Joseph, Oscar G, Marcos, Daniel and Audy.  Thank you very much to you guys and of course your Sales Rep. Tim.  He was amazing explaining in detail the benefits of going with Andersen windows.</review>

<review>Let me start by saying we are quite happy with having gone with Renewal by Andersen for replacing a couple sliding doors & window. They're pricier than another quote we got but these feel sturdy and well made.

We've had to call them a couple times needing minor adjustments & their techs took care of us each time. Thanks Dan!

We are quite pleased with the quality of their products and responsive customer support.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1515512302058, 'text': "Ray, we're so glad you're happy with your choice!

I just want to say I love the windows.  I think Installers could of put sheet of pastic up to keep the dust and white stuff out of my house  I was very pleased with Fernando the painter   He did an awesome job and even helped me put up my light cover that fell during the night.  He cleaned up after himself and was very polite and got everything repainted and it looks great.</Review>

I can't rave enough about product or service. From my first encounter, I was impressed. Jeff Myers, my salesman, arrived precisely, on time and demonstrated all of the advantages of Anderson Renewal patio doors. I really didn't need convincing, as I have had Anderson windows when I lived in Minnesota.
Jeff set me up with, Mike, who, again was on time, quick at measuring, and extremely polite. Order was confirmed, build scheduled and ready when promised.
Today Vincente and Oscar arrived at 9:00 ready for action. They secured the area with drop cloths and furniture covers and got to work. The patio door was fully installed, clean, and area put back to normal.
I couldn't be happier with the whole process, or with the product.
Thanks again!

Very good quality door.  Purchased 2 patio sliding doors.  Working very nicely.  Quality and professional installation by 3 very good persons  Jesus,  Christian V., and Marcus H. from start to finish.  Courteout, answered any questions, and gave us explanations on how the installation work would be done. Completed work timely and cleaned area when  leaving.

Highly recommend Renewal By Anderson for windows and gliding glass doors.  Very professional and wood finish better than expected.  Installation was on time and without problems.  Great people doing the installation and followup detail work.

I am so happy with my Renewal by Andersen windows and doors! They look amazing, but even more, the two men who did the work, Pedro Ballesteros & Marcos Hernandez, were both phenomenal!  They were professional, polite and meticulous in their work. They worked carefully and diligently, Pedro a terrific & experienced teacher to Marcos a very attentive & adept student.
I would absolutely recommend highly, the company, the product, and these two wonderful workers.

July 3, 2017
Today, all the touch-up work was done by Fernando Solis, who was equally as capable and competent as Pedro & Marcos were. Now every window and door are pure perfection!  Kudos to Andersen for hiring such high quality workers with wonderful skills & great character! I couldn't speak more highly of these men. I'm thoroughly thrilled with each Andersen sliding window and both sliding doors. My ONLY REGRET is that I did not choose to replace my front door at the same time!< /Review>< resp>

< review>
We recently installed a sliding door and a dining room window. As we researched products, Jeff from Renewal came to our home and spent quite a bit of time explaining their product.  There are monetary incentives for ordering from him immediately.We do not make rash decisions.  He did give us until the end of the day but after talking to a salesperson from another company, we realized we would go with Renewal.
Because the windows are custom, there is a waiting period of a few weeks while the windows are constructed. But they finished ours a little early and we were delighted.Throughout the waiting period Renewal
stayed in touch with us by phone. The ladies that perform this service are
very competent and kind.
On the day of installation, Audy A. and Lupe V. arrived promptly and began work immediately. They work together well and were very professional and friendly. Although they were very efficient, they did not
rush the project. The job did take all day but we were happy with that
because they did not have to come back. They did it right the first time!
Fernando came a few days later and did a very efficient touch up with paint. He arrived within the time the schedulers said he would and
was friendly.
Andy, Lupe and Fernando all did such a wonderful cleanup job and left no signs that they had been there.
Although Renewal is more pricey then many window companies, we feel
we got our money's worth.  The professionals that we dealt with were
a step above other companies and the product is superior. It is 100 degrees in our backyard right now but when you put your hand to the
glass, it is cool to the touch.</review>

We were very impressed with the way our installers, Richard Nobles and Oscar Castro, approached our window installation. They told us what they were going to do and did it with pride and skill with every detail. They delivered on the promised "red carpet" commitment of Renewal by Anderson.</Text>

We hired Renewal by Anderson to install three French doors. We met with Greg who came over and talked with us about the doors. We were very impressed and went with his company immediately. The two gentlemen who did the installation, Jose I and Christian V, were very professional, kind, polite and a pleasure to work with. Upon completing the job they cleaned everything up to perfection.<//text>

<review>Excellent customer service. I purchased my original sliding door 10+ years ago and it became difficult to open the door. I called customer service and they arranged a service call and parts replacement and the only charge was a $45 service call as the door came with an extended warranty. Due to the problem it required two visits; but only the one charge. One of the parts took several weeks but they kept me well informed. My service tech both visits was Dan H, who was friendly and knowledgeable and finished quickly. Would definitely recommend and purchase any windows or doors through Renewal by Anderson!< /review><rate>5< /rate>< pictures>

Renewal By Andersen Windows was our choice for new doors (French and singular) and windows in our home. Top professionalism in all aspects in our dealings. Their representative (aka DREW T.) who came to our home to discuss our wants and needs was outstanding. The two workmen (aka Vicente M. and Oscar C. were ABSOLUTE (clean, courteous and caring) and were way ahead of the curve in expertise and work ethic. So pleased with our decision to go with Renewal by Andersen.< /text>

As of this posting we are very satisfied with the installation done by Dan H. However the customer service of your office staff leaves much to be desired and it is unfathomable to believe that after 2 months our screen is still on backorder from a company that constantly advertises that they make ALL of their own products. Unbelievable!< /text>

< Review>
Dan was very clean and polite and showed up within the scheduled appointment window.  He repaired my window damage without leaving a mess of any kind inside or out. There were plants outside and a piano next to the inside of the window. The repair is likely as good as it could be since water had damaged the wood and caused it to warp. He left it clean and hardly noticeable. Also didn’t take long. There was no charge, which I really appreciated. The only way to really get it perfect would be to replace all the wood; there is still a sagging where the warp is, but I don’t think anyone will see it. That’s the only reason for the 4 stars, otherwise I would definitely recommend Dan and Renewal by Andersen to take care of problems well.</Review>

As I've come to expect from this company, my latest experience was great. I asked if two of my Renewal by Anderson window screens could be replaced since they were corroding at the edge where the stainless screening material mated with the aluminum frame. They asked for a couple pictures and ordered the screens.

When they called to say the screens were in, I fully expected they'd have me stop by to pick them up. Nope, they said they'd deliver them.

Dan H. came by and installed them. He even called to say he was running early and would it be OK to stop by 45 minutes earlier than the appointment time.

The one thing I would suggest is to await a promotion with a straight percentage discount. I made the mistake of contracting when they offered a certain number of free windows based on the total number ordered. Since the free ones are the cheapest ones, I chose to leave out the one really small bathroom window to get a more expensive window free. I planned to buy that one window later but didn't realize the installation price for a single window makes that an expensive option. Yes, I shot myself in the foot and now sit with one non-matching window.

Update: After eight years, the need arose to have all of the weatherstripping replaced. No problem. RBA came and installed all new weatherstripping. John G did a great job and worked his tail off.</Review>

Oscar Gomez, Lead person showed up with Alan Robinson at the appointed time, went over all the work they were going to perform, then they laid down the protective covering for the carpet and hard surface areas, then the rest of the crew of Christian Viera, and Oscar Castro showed up, they proceeded to discuss what and by whom the work was going to be done and proceeded to perform the work. I told them I was a retired Carpenter Working Supervisor, and that unless I got in their way I was going to do what little I could do, Oscar Gomez had no problem, so I proceeded.

I admired the working relationship they have and it was a wonderful and joyous experience I had, they all acted with great respect for myself and my wife, they treated our home as though it was their own.

I told Oscar Gomez that no one works at out home without my wife and I providing them with lunch!

They agreed, and Alan Robinson wanted to  get his lunch at Puffy Taco as he remembered it when he was a kid, so my wife got a menu and they all picked what they wanted and we went 30 minutes before they broke for lunch, got them their food, brought it home, laid their food on the dinner table, told them to get their drinks from the refrigerator and they had a very pleasant lunch and were very grateful for the kindness my wife and I showed them.

Oscar Gomez discovered that they were not in possession of all that was needed, he called the shop to see if it was there, and discovered that the item was not shipped, they apologized and explained what had happened, we understood and stated that it was not a problem.

When they were done with the installation, they cleaned up the inside of the house where they had worked as well as the outside, my wife gave them some cookies for their afternoon break.

Oscar Gomez took my wife and I through a walk through on all 6 windows and the sliding door demonstrating how they work, we were very satisfied with their work, their respect of my wife and I and the feeling of friendship that was fostered during the job.

We highly recommend Renewal by Anderson, they product is great, and their employees to perform the installation are great themselves.<//review>

At first I was a bit wary about this project but Oscar and Audy did a fantastic job installing the window. They were friendly and efficient. If the employees are a representation of Andersen Windows, I can see them flourishing for a long time. I can't wait for the stucco guys to get here and complete the project that I have been stalling for 4 years.<//Text>

Dan H. Was very courteous, professional and timely.
I did have one issue though. There was left over glazing on one of the windows entire periphery that took me to over 30 minutes to remove. Not Dan’s fault though.... production fault. Quality issue.<//review>

< review>
I purchased windows over a decade ago. I recently had my flooring demoed. I found that my sliding glass door was leaking at the base from a recent rain. I called to have someone take a look from Renewal by Anderson. Kurt Brown, Service Manager, came by that same day. He removed the door and lifted up the base and inspected for issues. He recaulked under the base inside and the face of the outside. He was able take care of this prior to my floor installation. He was neat, clean, respectful, courteous and efficient. My issues were resolved. There was no charge, to my surprise! I couldn't believe the service I received, with no charge, for windows purchased over a decade ago! Thanks Kurt!< /review>

<text>We are totally pleased with the windows and patio door slider we had replaced...excellent quality and workmanship.  The installation by Omar M., Christian x. and Joel M. was very well done from preparation to finishing.  Marco did a fine job the next day with touch up and paint and assured us of follow thru of some questions we had.  We had a very positive experience with Renewal by Andersen and plan to replace the remaining windows in our home.

A couple of years later, we asked Andersen Renewal to fix a window pull and latch where the screws had come away from the frame and would not tighten. Service Technician, Daniel H., did a great job repairing and securing the the hardware. We had Andersen Renewal install window pulls to enable ease of opening and closing the windows, but we need to be careful not to bump the pulls against the window frame.</text>< date>

Dan H did a great job checking my windows over for a possible issue.  There was no issue, of course, but Anderson prides itself on its great reputation.  Clearly, that’s why Dan H is there.  He’s a kind man who did a great job with kindness.< /review>

Christian A and Refugio did an outstanding job of installation, both the French doors and bathroom window.  They protected the inside of the house from getting messed up and made the install top notch, even dealing with a not so plum house.<//review>

< Review>
In February of 2014, I had windows and a patio door installed. Great! No problem! I loved the look and I was happy
Fast forward to 2016-2017, we were blasted by rain. Up until this point, we'd( Southern California) had no real rain. So all of a sudden we're drenched days in a row.  Well I noticed the inside of my patio door was wet and there was dripping...not a lot but a slow drip. I called Renewal by Andersen, explained the problem! No problem...they scheduled a service call and Jesus and Marcos showed up and very professionally repaired my problem. He showed and explained what the problem was and showed me how he repaired it. They both did this in less than 30 minutes!! I am satisfied!!<//Review>

<text>My installation of a 96" wide living room window was quite impressive. Richard and Oscar C, were professional arriving on time and getting right to work. The window is beautiful inside and out. Seems a shame to put the blinds back up.
I would recommend Renewal by Anderson to anybody. Bit pricy, but I did not get any other quotes from other companies.
I'll still use them again for the second window I'd like to replace.

A very positive experience. Well crafted product
and the company stands behind their product
with an outstanding warranty.
Recently a repair was needed and the company
send out Dan H. From the repair department.
A prompt and expert repair was completed.
A shout out to service representative, Curt who put
the warranty repair request in motion.</Review>

The guys from RBA came on time on the day of install. They introduced themselves to our family and even became acquainted with our dogs. They worked together well and took their time to make sure every door and window was installed correctly.  Throughout the 3 days of install they maintained open lines of communication. I was always updates and informed when they were leaving for the day and returning the next morning.  No guessing! When they were done, they took us through each type of window and door and explained how it opened and closed as well as maintenance specifics. All together I am a very happy customer. Thank you to Christian A., Richard and Audi for the awesome job!!</review>

The flaw had to do with thickness inconsistency in one type of window. They came out for about 90 minutes and replaced the window. We asked them if the problem involved functionality or just aesthetics. They said it was just aesthetics. We’ve never had a company call us up and offer to replace something when we hadn’t even noticed a problem.

We chose to have our entire house updated (45 year old windows and sliders!) by Renewal by Anderson. Matt Novotchin was generous with his time and expertise as he helped us make our choices. From the beginning to the end of the process each worker was professional and competent. Our installers, led by Jesus V., with Valentin, Marcos H., Jonathan (Refugio), Luis Vargas and Lupe, were courteous and completed the work within the timeframe. They put our blinds back up. Touchup painting was done neatly, giving us the clean look we desired. Thanks to Renewal by Andersen for making our home stylish, secure, and more energy efficient.<//Text>

<Text>A few months ago we had our sliding glass doors replaced by Andersen. We found the weather stripping on the kitchen slider was torn. So we called and spoke with Kurt to schedule a replacement. He came out promptly, measured, ordered the part and a few weeks later called to schedule the installation. Dan was the installer, he's polite, quick, efficient and even showed up right on time with a call thirty minutes share! I can't say enough good things about my experience from the initial contact with  Jim Barone,  the sales person, to installation to resolving warranty issues....they're the best of the best.<//Text><user>102314828490409426716< /user><Rating>5</Rating>< username>

Dan H. was sent by Renewal by Andersen to repair my French doors which were not opening smoothly.

He knew right away what the problem was and repaired the issue.   Dan was very nice and professional, and I was very impressed with his caring demeanor.   I'm so glad he was sent to help us out.  I highly recommend him!

If you are looking to install French doors, look no further.  Renewal by Andersen is a first class company that takes great care of their customers with great employees like Dan!< /Review>

The installers were very meticulous with our new bay window. It looks wonderful and allows so much more light in. Christian and Refugio were very helpful with all concerns for the install. Very satified.

Dan H. performed service on my bay window today, 04-08-19. He was quick, efficient and very knowledgable. He answered all my questions and fixed the issue in no time at all. Very satisfied.<//review>

Found them at a car show. Informed the gentlemen we wanted French doors. He said not a problem and the cost should be about $4,000-$6,000. Scheduled a free in home estimate. Had to turn them down when the 'best' they could do was $11,500! Received two more quotes and found a local guy to do the same request for $4,800 for Milgard brand. Big rip off!!! Do your homework.</Text>

The company who installed the windows is no longer in business, but we Curt Brown at the Laguna Hills location helped us.  He ordered the necessary parts and restored the window to working order at no charge as they were warranted.  This company stands behind their product.
HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!!

8/2019 - We had an issue with one of the cables in our windows, and had it replaced by Dan H. and Zack S. - they were great!  Arrived on time, completed the work quickly, and explained why we encountered the problem.  They are 2 very pleasant guys, and we highly recommend Renewal by Andersen of Orange County.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

< Review>
Last week I had 2 sliding glass doors and 2 windows installed by Renewal by Andersen. I am very satisfied! From the initial sales presentation with Carlos, to the measuring appointment with Omar, and the two-day seamless installation process with Christian A., Refugio, and Valentin, I have only praise and satisfaction for this company. Everything proceeded as promised. Omar was exceedingly meticulous with his measurements, which was important because I have expensive plantation shutters that I did not want removed or damaged in any way. Christian and his crew took extra good care of my home and furnishings when having to remove stucco from around the sliding glass doors. All of my belongings were carefully covered and protected from the messy dust, and my hardwood floors were protected with carpets. Chris, Cuco, and Valentin were professional, respectful, highly competent, and very pleasant to be around.

That said, RBA is high-end. The price is considerable. But there are some things you don't want to go cheap on. Quality doors and windows are a sound investment for any home. I feel I made the right decision going with RBA.</Review>

< Review>
We recently had 2 large windows replaced by Andersen.  We first went by the office to check out working models and options.  We then had 2 home visits where the details were decided and measurements were taken.  After obtaining HOA approval, the beautiful, easy-sliding, heat-blocking new windows were installed by Christian V and Jesus.  They were clean, professional, skilled, and left the house as if they had never been there.  They also explained how to use and care for the new windows.  I had a slight concern the following day and the company sent out Vicente the following who checked everything out and cleared up my concern.  The company has been responsive and professional at every step.<//Review>

I had 2 windows and a large sliding door replaced. The quality is excellent. Our previous home had less expensive vinyl windows but we had to have several replaced due to the seals leaking and fogging up. The installers were polite and professional.< /review>

We needed a window replaced. We chose Renewal by Anderson for the replacement window. The options they provided meet all our needs. Our salesman Paul Poirier spent the time needed to make the right decisions regarding our purchase. Installers Oscar G and Richard N were professional and informative with the installion. The window is beautiful!</text>

Dan H. came out to addresssome issues with our big picture windows. Dan was great, he inspected windows, determined what needed to be done, explained what he found and what he was going to do and how it would resolve the problem. He worked quickly and got the job done in no time. He explained what he had done and tested things to make sure they were resolved. Overall he did a great job and I can't recommend him enough. Thanks again Dan.<//Review>

I had an opportunity to observe the work of Pedro and Valentine in detail, and was impressed with their conscious work ethics and attention to detail. They might be on expensive side but considering you will live with these windows for a long time, I think it was worth it.< /Review>

<Review>Ran into Kenny downtown Huntington Beach chili competition, what a great guy. Went over differences between Andersen and the compition. What a nice guy, offered to come check out my current windows. Unfortunately ive just started another project. If the rest of the company is just like Kenny, I look forward to making contact with Andersen, hopefully buy the end of the year.< /Review>< pictures>

My client lives on a fairly busy street and gets very direct afternoon sun —we are amazed at how perfectly quiet it is now and how there is no heat coming through any of those windows !!
All the service people from Mark the sales person to the installers to the touch up guy have all been five star ⭐️ wonderful to work with  and boy do they know their stuff !!  I highly recommend this company and their top top quality products.   You will pay more but you will get a lot more for your money because they are the best !  PS no I’m not related to anyone At Anderson renewal windowsj, ust a very satisfied customer😀<//Review>

This is the third time I've used this company. It is on the pricey side, but the quality is worth it. My living room windows are about 10 years old and look brand new. Have had two patio doors installed by them and a very large 8'x4' window as well.

Jesus and Joel were my installers, and if you can request them, I recommend you do. They did a fantastic job, left everything spotless.

Not sure if I will replace any more windows but, if I do, I won't hesitate to return to Renewal by Anderson.</review>

I had Anderson Renewal install all new windows and doors in my house over 13 years ago. The three 12-foot wide windows were leaking badly and I had one window that was broken due to a painter's mishap. I placed a service call and even though my windows were old they were very professional and sent someone out to assess the problem. Dan H., the technician, came out twice to fix the leaks and the broken window. Dan caulked all the windows on the outside of the house and that completely stopped the leaks. The water intrusion was caused not by the windows, but by the stucco pulling away from the casing. Renewal is all about stopping the leaks and subsequent damage. While Dan was there he also fixed one of my doors which was sticking badly. He did this on his own as he saw it was not functioning properly. Dan also installed a new door handle and expertly fixed the broken window. I have had a lot of contractors at my home and Dan is at top of the list. He is fast, expert at his craft, and a really nice guy. He also lets you know if he is running late. Very professional service all the way around from Renewal by Anderson. I would recommend them and ask for Dan H.<//Text>

The service I received was great.Had an issue with front doors I purchased in 2014 so called on a Tues and received a call back that afternoon from Dan H and an appointment set for Wed. Dan not only showed up at exact time he said he would but was extremely professionally friendly. Fixed the problem right away and when showd him back door he took time to fix that one too which was purchased at same time.
I would highly reccommend Anderson Windows simply because of Dan H and good honest service is hard to find these days<//review>

<Review>I just had Renewal By Anderson install a new french patio door, and a new doggie door, replacing an old sliding door.  The installation crew - Oscar G., Richard N. and Omar S., did a great job.  They were professional and highly skilled.  The door looks as if it were there since the house was built.  They did great job installing and cleaning up afterwards.</Review>< Name>

I had my windows  installed by Renewal by Anderson  and the whole process was done  with professionalism.  From sells ( Mat Novotchin ), Charles  Gindele and the whole team back at the warehouse  / factory  with regard to making calls, addressing any concerns or questions  and my installation guys (Omar and Michael ) were great.  When you making a costly  investment  such as windows  you want the job done right  and handled with professionalism and  care and no extra long breaks and or down time. Just work hard and get the job done and Done right. That's exactly what my guys did and it's Greatly  Appreciated!
Thank you,  Jim< /text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>The windows are beautiful! In total I had seven (7) Windows & a Patio Door installed. Everyone who came to complete the installation, were very professional, except for arriving on time. The work took a total of four(4) days.  I travel 30+ minutes to reach the house I was having the windows installed in. I would arrive at 8am, since I was given an hour 8a to 9a arrival time for each day. They never arrived within that time frame.
After my arrival this last morning, 20 minutes later I received a call. The Painter was going to arrive about 11a. After four days of late arrivals, I was totally frustrasted as all heck! I could of delayed drivng through morning rush hour traffic & could have taken care of other business if I would have been contacted earlier.  Everyone from beginning to end appointment, knew I did not live at the address & that I would be drving a distance (10 miles) to reach the house. The only other dissapointment was they installed the Bathroom Window molding around the Towel Holder wall mount. They actually cut out a half moon section from the side of the window molding which looked so tacky! Why not ask me if I'd rather just remove the towel holder from the wall, being that the towel holder was in the way. After I placed a call & spoke to the Manager, I've been assured they will correct this imperfection to my satisfaction. I sure hope they will be on time!</Review>< pictures>

My career has been as an executive  in commercial real estate management. From our meetings with Jim Barone, our sales consultant, to the installation team of Casey, Freddy, Pedro, Jorge , Jimmy, Jesus, Joseph, Frank D., the touch-up painter and Dan Hartheim, the service technician, we were very impressed with the excellent quality of the windows, the installation and the terrific, positive attitudes of all the men that worked on the job! They were impressive professionals who clearly conveyed their desire to provide us the best quality of installation possible. We are very pleased with the replacement of all our windows of our home!</Text>

<Text>We are very happy with our new windows, French Door and Gliding Patio Door from Renewal By Andersen of Orange County.  It all started with a pleasant trip to their showroom in Laguna Hills.  Lisa was so nice, accommodating and informative and was a BIG part in our decision to consider Renewal By Anderson.  We ended up calling the phone number and got routed to Andersen's central call center.  This was the only bad experience we had.  The call center was rude and did not even want to set up an appointment since we were going through an insurance claim on our kitchen due to a water slab leak.  I explained to them that the windows had nothing to do with the insurance and we wanted to take the opportunity to upgrade our windows while the kitchen was being worked on.  I was totally frustrated with their call center and almost didn't book an appointment and told them if they don't want my business, I'll install Milgard windows.  (Hint: When you call for an appointment, try to call the Laguna Hills office directly).  Enough about the Call Center (making my blood boil).  Sean M was the sales guys from Andersen who came by and he was very pleasant and knowledgeable and went through all of our options.  We really enjoyed Sean.  We ended up purchasing six windows and a French Door and actually later added a Gliding Patio Door as well.  Vicente M and Bernardo S and the crew installed the windows and doors and were very professional.  They worked very hard and their workmanship was top notch.  You can tell they knew their product.  After the work was completed, they cleaned up everything nicely.  They were very conscientious in their work.  Yes, it was expensive, but you can tell we got a very high quality product.  We love the secure locking mechanism on the doors.  We highly recommend Renewal By Andersen of Orange County.< /Text>< pics>

<review>Thank you, Renewal by Andersen of Orange County for a job done even better than my high expectations. Your crew of installers, Vincente M., Jimmy I., and Joseph were exceptional. Painter Richard was fabulous as well. We had a challenging project with extensive woodwork to be cared for during the install and this crew flawlessly installed 4 new windows and french doors without a single ding to our existing wood work. I never really believed that you could do this install without damage to our current wood work - you proved me wrong! We look forward to using your team again. Perfect stain on the inside and the canvas on the outside was the perfect custom match for our home. Good bye old wooden warped casement windows - hello beautiful custom stained fibrex.< /review><GmapID>0x80dce87a78a1c3d3:0xbde68f73f1075fe1< /GmapID>< resp>

Wow...what a job.  We had 42 windows and 1 sliding door and I'm a clean freak.  I wasn't looking forward to this process but I was truly surprised at how well it went.  First of all it started with Matt Novotchin our salesman.  He was so thorough and his follow up was stellar!  The installation manager was Michael Wherry and he was on top of everything which included measuring everything... A+ and the highest praise I could give.  Now I need to mention the project manager Casey, he ran the job from day to day which took 9 long days, and he was the main reason why we went with Renewal because our neighbor was having them installed and my husband went and talked to Casey and he showed him the product and explained the installation process.  Thank you Casey! I'd be remiss if I didn't mention all the great guys on the crew, Valentin, Pedro,Vicente, Jonathan, Fidel, Joseph P., Jose I., Mike N., Bernado, Oscar C., and Marcos.  They were so respectful and patient with my obsessiveness.  I couldn't recommend this company if I didn't love the product and what was the upmost of importance was the installation process.  It was a pricey job but it was worth every penny!!</Text>

<review>Wow is what this family says and everyone else who has walked through our front door since the incredible crew from Renewal by Andersen of Orange County finished our installations this week. Their salesman Tim Shiebler arrived in November, the day after the Newport Beach City Council approved Ygrene Energy Fund to fund green energy installations in Newport Beach. This approval allowed to press forward on the installation of six energy saving doors and windows.......and yes a premium price is paid for a premium product with expert installation. As a 40 year contractor I have high expectations for anyone working on my home...........I wasn't let down.

Once Neil arrived to spend hours taking exacting measurements for our custom bay windows, front and rear door units plus two beautiful 8 ft French sliders, the order was entered and the short waiting time started. Start to finish was literally about six weeks. Under the professional guidance of Casey Salazar, our project manager, his team of Jose I., Bernardo, Jose V. Christian they made a difficult installation look simple. Start to finish over the last week before Christmas and this week the crew worked like the professionals they are and are great representatives of this amazing company. Next week will bring the touch up experts to finish off this amazing start-to-finish project.< /review>< Pics>

<review>We had our widows and slider replaced 11 years ago by Dial 1, currently Renewal by Anderson. Recently, we had problems with the slider door. I called Renewal by Anderson and spoke with Kurt Brown. Kurt immediately ordered parts and a couple of weeks later, Dan Hartzheim came out and repaired the door by installing a new track in only a few minutes. The work was still under the original warranty and the cost was very minimal. I was amazed that after 11 years, Renewal by Anderson would come out and repair the door so quickly and for such a minimal fee. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for replacement doors and windows. I would also like to thank Kurt and Dan for their professionalism and quick and thorough response to my problem.< /review>< gmap_id>

<username>Kate Aull<//username><date>1491765611360< /date><rate>5< /rate><Review>I had nothing but a REALLY GREAT EXPERIENCE with Renewal by Anderson.  The installers of a new, Pedro and Fernando were wonderful!  As I am very particular and, always questioning, the 2 of them were extremely patient with me and rather endearing.  They did not mind my questions as why this or that was being done, and, if I found/saw something I wasn't particularly happy with, when almost done, Pedro and Fernando would fix it without question.

The other point that you are to be congratulated on is your schedulers, and their follow-up.
Your customer service, in this new world of "no customer service is necessary after the sale" is to be commended and taught!  Thank you!

I am going to have more windows replaced, bit-by-bit and I will not go to another company to have the work done, and, I want Pedro and Fernando back to do the work.

Thank you Rennewal by Anderson Windows.  I am very happy with quality of product and quality of workmanship.  Also, follow-up with Tim Shiebler was great as well.

I think you guys are fabulous!

I had 8 windows installed at my property on 12/6/16 and the installers , German and David, did a wonderful job!  Even though their team was short 1 person due to sickness, they assured me all 8 windows would be installed in 1 day.  They worked continuously, through lunch, and into the early evening after the sunset to keep their promise.  I am happy with their customer service too.  The team at Renewal By Andersen Orange County - including Tim Schiebler who helped order my windows, Jacqueline Jelkin who helped schedule the installation, and Lindsey Bachman and Ann Hill who both followed up with my post-installation and helped schedule the window inspection - were always available to answer any questions and address any concerns I had about the process.  I am happy with my new windows!  Thank you!</review>

<Review>Dan Hartzheim came out to install the replacment sashes. As usual, he and his crew were prompt, professional and courteous.  I would recommend Renewal by Anderson and Dan to everyone.

Dan Hartzheim came out to my San Clemente home to service and repair my windows and doors. He was very professional and personable. He took care of all my issues in a timely manner. He made me feel like my issues were real and important. Amazing service. Well done. Thank you.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1514042331570, 'text': "Dennis, it was our pleasure!

<Text>I would like to give my review on my new Renewal by Anderson doors and windows!  I rarely give a five star rating to anything because I have a thing about nothing being perfect!  Well my experience with the Renewal team has made my list! We were shopping for six Windows, two patio doors and a new front door.  We have read a lot of reviews, asked family and friends, also our neighbors about their recent window purchases! Some were really good and some not so good.  The common among all of them was that they all had vinyl Windows installed!   I have nothing against vinyl Windows, heck I sold them myself.  But I you want a quality custom retrofit window, Renewal by Anderson is the way to go!  It started with our Sales Consultant Carlos Jimenez.   He showed up on time,  took a rough measurements of our doors and windows, gave us our pricing options.  We made our decision on the spot!  A few days later Mr Jimenez had a thank you card and a beautiful flower arrangement sent to our house! We were scheduled for our official measurements a week later with Job Technician Mike Booker.  Very professional, went over and with great detail confirmed everything!   On August 25, 26 and 27th was our install date.  8:30am on the 25th (on time and on the right date) our install team rang our door bell.  Christian A., Joseph P and Joel introduced themselves.  Neat, clean each day.  All you can ask for.  By day 3 everything was completed and ready for our touch up appointment!  I will review that when it happens! All in all, my wife and I are completely satisfied with the entire Renewal Orange County team!  The do it  right!  Follow up calls, appointment calls and especially our thank you card and Cookies (yes cookies) from the owner Charlie Gindele himself!
Thank you,
Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales

Our touch up is complete!!!! Thank you Frank D. For the neat and clean job you did on our touch ups on our front and patio doors!! Looks great!<//Text><Time>1473704281908</Time>< Pics>

<text>I dont think the review i previously started ever went thru
Dan H came to adjust both sliders. He could immediately see that 1 screen door was off track & he also stated that no dog could have walked into or thru the screen as it was clearly very straight & in just like-new condition. He showed me how to get the screen off & put it back correctly.
Dan H was extremely professional, approprIately friendly & most helpful! Thanks to Dan's excellent care & expertise, my sister & I will definately be getting new windows & another slider downstairs from Renewal by Andersen.

I have heard that they are not your typical windows installer but I was pleasant surprised by the service I received from them.
I got introduced to them via door to door salesmen that were in uniform and were extremely polite with some knowledge of the product.  I decided to set up an appointment with their Design Consultant.  Renewal by Anderson office called to remind me of my appointment.  My design consultant, Daniel Mecham was on time and spent plenty of time explaining the difference between Renewal by Anderson windows vs. the popular vinyl windows.  It appeared to be more than just another sales pitch since I have had really bad experience with vinyl windows at my previous house so I was willing to pay a little extra to get better quality.  Daniel worked with me to get all credit approvals and provide me with details to turn in to HOA for approval as well.
Once I received the HOA approval, Renewal by Anderson sent over the Job Technician, Dennis Rohrbach, who did a real through job in measuring the windows. Once the measurements were taken, it was discovered by the HQ installation Manager, Michael Wherry that one of the windows might not work the way the Design Consultant had explained. Michael along with the Sales Manager, Joey Obledo came to my house to explain how the windows along with the front entrance door we had bought will not work as designed and presented me with different options.  We ended up picking one of the options. This is an exceptional customer service that I had not experienced in a very long time.
The installation team showed on time to start the installation, it took them three days to install and one day to finish up the trimming.  All furniture was put back for me to use at night if it was moved during the day time. They cleaned every day and were considered of my neighbors. The installation team was made up of Project Manager Casey and associates, Jose, Oscar, Freddie, Omar, Bernardo, Joseph, Josh and Dan Hernandez.  The trim guys were Marco and Frank.  I would like to whole heartedly thank them for their awesome job and professionalism.
I know this review is longer then what I am use to writing but this is a great company with great employees and they have not forgotten about customer service. Not to sound like a cliché but surely you get what you pay for with this company. I would like to highly recommend them to anyone looking to replace their windows, sliding door and front entrance doors.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>We recently had two 28 year-old sliding glass patio doors replaced by Renewal by Anderson of Orange County and could not be happier with the whole process starting with the first phone call and ending with the final touchup.  We had the pleasure of seeing the finest group of professionals at work we have dealt with in our 64 years of marriage.  And the end product is fantastic – just as advertised.
The first person we met with face-to-face was Jim Barone in Sales who did an outstanding job of showing us the details of the product and describing the removal and replacement process.  Next was Mike Booher who developed the details for the replacement doors for the factory.  Then came the installation team of Jose’ I, Joseph Z, and Omar S.  And finally the touchup team of Frank and Marco.  All were obviously well qualified and must have gone to charm school.
