Everything was really delicious. Great seafood menu for a local place. The monster michelada didn't disappoint. We ordered the sampler platter for two, everything on the plate was savory. We substituted the oysters for garlic shrimp. It tasted as good as it looks.< /Review>

Long wait, poor service, tortillas served at the end, but I think you sould get better service on slower days because they are so unorganized. Food was good not great but okay</Text>

We went there for lunch I ordered the nachos right from the start I knew it wasn’t going to be good when I tasted the salsa. The salsa had a strange flavor I can’t pinpoint. The chips were hard so I had a hard time eating them. I normally eat them thin. We asked for flour chips and they were good but didn’t like the salsa it was unlike any we normally have at Mexican restaraunts. My husband had a regular burrito. He said there was a lot of fat in the meat and didn’t enjoy it. The nachos were not good either. They were flat on the plate with some kind of red sauce on it unlike nachos which are normally piled up on a plate. I did like the red sauce on the nachos but didn’t like the chips in them too hard. We will not be returning.< /text>

The food here is amazing! They start you off with chips and salsa and a very flavorful soup. The horchata is very good as well. I ordered a chile relleno plate and I loved it! My husband ordered shrimp tacos costa and he loved them. Everyone was very happy with what they ordered. Whenever I want mexican food from now on, I'm coming here!<//Review>

Super friendly staff! Great good as well. I ordered a shrimp and octupus cocktail and it was absolutely delicious. The building itself is pretty small but they do accommodate pretty big parties. They have a pretty big variety on their menu too. This is a place I would definitely come to again for great sea food!<//Text>

<text>Ordered through DoorDash and when my order arrived it was missing 2 Tacos and the Tacos I received were incorrect. I called the store and told them what happened they told me to wait 15mins and they would get the order. Well they meant for me for me to go pick it up. The whole reason for DoorDash was to not leave the house. I waited and hour and called them back, well my missing order is ready, but not being delivered to me and when I told them I’m unable to leave the house and to just refund that part of my order they told me to just call DoorDash again (in very broken English this whole time) I explained to them I did not want to pay all the DoorDash fees for them to go and get the missing part of my order. It wasn’t DoorDash’s fault they screwed up my order and they won’t refund me. The food wasn’t very good either. Will NEVER order there again AND will tell all my friends to not go there.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

READ READ READ! Ordered lunch from them through DoorDash. Food was subpar at best and was missing items. Upon contacting DoorDash, our driver told us this wasn’t the first time a mistake was made and to contact the restaurant. We did and they told us we had to go “come get your food yourself”. If i had to DoorDash my food, what makes you think i’m now magically able to go now? Anyway, they wouldn’t refund us missing items and blamed door dash for stealing our missing food. ZERO out of 5 stars and filed a complaint through DoorDash about the claim made against them.< /review>

We had a very good lunch, food was tasty and our server was pleasant. However she got busy so we had to go to the counter to request our check. Girl at the counter was not very friendly and overcharged us on EVERY ITEM we ordered. I felt it was a lot more than it should have been. Unfortunately I was not able to compare the prices until I got home ( several hour drive) but we paid 15.00 more than it should have been plus 3.50 to use my debit card. I don't believe this was a mistake as every item was charged more than their stated price on the menu. Very untrustworthy!<//Text>

Food was good. But servers were very unorganized. We requested our drinks 3 times and our silverware as well. When they brought our silerware they touched it directly without using a napkin to wrap it in. Not sure if I would recommend it.</Review>

check your bill! They don’t charge what the menu price says. They also don’t do the right amount of taxes  to your bill. Won’t be coming back the food was not so great either. Only been here twice the first time I thought the garlic shrimp was good but this time that I ordered it was completely different and not good. Took forever to get our food. The waitress we got was nice though.<//Review>

Terrible experience!  We got at this place at 2:28pm... the place was semi full but most of the people were already finishing up.  And emptied within 15 minutes of us being there.  There was 3 waitresses plus the owner and probably cooks in the back.  Our waitress took over 15 minutes just to take our order.. when she came back to take our order in drinks I asked her if she could take our order.. she said “yeah in a bit, let me bring drink first and walked away.  After we ordered we waited 30 minutes for 3 shrimp tacos and 1 order of enchiladas.  Mind you I know they weren’t going out to fish for our shrimp, everything is already made and just needs to be assembled.. I should not have to wait 30+ minutes for someone to assemble 3 tacos when the place is completely empty.  I ended up canceling my order and leaving, if I wanted my meal to take that long I could’ve just made it at home.< /review>

< Review>
Real good food, great service. They have $1 taco Tuesdays and the tacos are fat. The micheladas come with grilled jumbo shrimp not just that regular baby cold shrimp your usto. One of my favorite things about this place is that they dont warm tortillas in microwave like everyone else, chips are fresh not stale and your plate comes with 2 complementary quesadillas. I always walk out of that place stuffed. GREAT PRICES TOO, ILL ALWAYS GO BACK!<//Review>

Went here for the first time and really enjoyed my meal! They didn't have beer at the moment but I believe they re working to have it in about a month. The food was all great! Tacos were seasoned well and the sauce that comes with the oysters was bomb! I'm hoping they have micheladas here soon. Me and my wife will definitely be coming back!< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Went to this place for the first time and as soon as we sat down we were given a small cup of seafood soup. Right after, the tortilla chips and salsa arrived. I Ordered the Molcajete Zarape and learned that I have a small stomach... They serve you rice and beans with tortillas. The Molcajete itself is a monstrous rock plate with steak, shrimp, chicken, cactus, onions and short ribs smothered in green salsa. I definitely return for round two.<//review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Very upset I have gone here twice when I needed gas the most one time I ran out and had to walk to this place one pump was unlocked all the others were locked I use Google pay and it took my money but would not register on the pump cannot get it back for some reason even though I contacted mobile not the actual gas station but they shouldn't let you even hook up to a pump unless it's open and the lights should be off on it and the pump should be turned off and they should be able to refund your money they shouldn't even take money from you unless they are open! I have -15 in my account in which I'm not able to get back and it really makes me angry I live in my van and struggle day to day you know how hard it was to make that $15 and they just take it and not even give it back and tell you you're burnt pretty much<//review>

All I have to say about this place is, you won't find a better place to get your smog check. Fast, friendly, offers yelp deals when you check in at the shop and best part is they perform smog checks on older vehicles.

My second time here and they still offer the same great service as they did two years ago. Consistency can be hard, but they've found a way to do it and do it well.</Text>

<Review>The clerk at this store challenged me to a fight over an error.  I wrote to Mobil's corporate office,  but never received a response back. This was several weeks ago.  Even though convenient, I no longer go there.   I couldn't believe I would be challenged to a fight over an error.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Riding my bike, I had a low tire. Stopped by, asked attendant to please turn on air. He said sure, just get 4 quarters and put it in, it will start right up. I said really? You don't have courtesy air ? He said no! I will not go back there again!!! They have a way to charge for air and they are going to get their fair share of the money, 4 quarters at a time!</text>< response>

<Review>I had a great experience.  My car broke down while I was on a road trip and they got it running again even though my car is old and rare they found the right part for it. Price was good and they kept me updated throughout the process. Thank you guys!</Review><user_name>ha h<//user_name>< pictures>

Took my 2003 Honda and for air conditioning problem. Service was courteous, professional and prompt. I can always count on Affordable Automotive for an honest job on my car. Also the Nord Avenue location is very convenient for me. Thanks again will recommend you to all my friends. Staying cool.<//text>

It was a sensor. They were very professional and polite. Everything they said they made sure to follow threw with, they even dropped the finished proce off by a hundred dollars so we were happy. We will go back when and if we need to. Thank you Affordable Auto.<//text>< pictures>

These guys are awesome! Super friendly and professional. There was a slight differnce in an oil filter between a 2017 and 2018 model and rather than trying to force the older model they had to order a new which resulted in a longer completion time. Instead of just writing the situation off as it is what it is, they made some accomodations in the spirit of grreat customer service. This was my first time there and i am happy to say that i will choose them for my future auto repairs
Thanks guys!<//text>

I was stuck on the side of Nord with a flat tire and no one was picking up my calls and AAA was going to be a 70 minute wait. Right when I was going to let this ruin my day these guys took it upon themselves to get my car into their shop and put on a spare. Thank you so much Affordable Automotive West!!!</text>

Came here to get my oil changed twice, only to later find out that they were using recycled oil and weren’t changing the filter. Talk about taking advantage of a female college student.< /text>

Not many homes yet, some completed and they area very nice from the looks of outside finished ones.  Safe beautiful location with lots of hiking trails and nature nearby.  Underdevelopment at this time.  Building houses quickly.<//review>

<text>Lived here for 2 years. I really enjoy the community, it's  peaceful and clean.  The kindred house keeps the kids busy.  I like the convenience of having a gym and a hot tub on the premises and the kids love the pool. There's special monthly events held to maintain interactions among the community. I also like that it is a gated community.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808feeef5c6ad3e5:0x9791acf46a7a264c<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I am buying into Wallis Ranch this spring. While I can understand all the negative and positive reviews on here, our purchase was decided based on our personal lifestyle.

We currently own another home with a front lawn and back yard. With lots of money spent landscaping then maintaining, we are done with it. Our home is older home so we've always had to deal with upgrades, remodeling and maintenance. Again, we're done with that.

Wallis Ranch suited our lifestyle. We bought a 3000sf home for the same price as other existing smaller homes in Dublin. We love the kindred house and it's amenities. We love the fact that the community is secured and gated. We also like the fact that shopping, grocery, restaurants, golf etc are close by.

For us, we bought into a new home, convenience, amenities and not to mention, great schools. The community works perfect for US.

If you're looking for a newer home with more land and lower priced, move to Sacramento or Lodi or Bakersfield or Las Vegas. It just doesn't exist here in the Bay Area.< /review>< user_name>

1. Excellent public schools and a number of great private schools
2. Easy Commute due to close proximity to Bart
3. GATED, secluded haven with close proximity to nature --the specific house I bought has views of the rolling hills of Dublin
4. Resort like living --Although only 3 out of the 8 builders offer traditional backyards, half of the master plan’s acreage are devoted to parks, open space and a water-quality basin. A three-acre common area features an edible garden, fitness center, pool, spa and BBQ area surrounded by a mile of trail systems.
5. The price is reasonable --my house ended up being 420$/square foot. This is the average selling price of 4 bedroom homes in Dublin in the last 3 months at the time I reserved my home.
6. Close to Shopping centers San Francisco Premium Outlet, Whole Foods, Target, Persimmon Place, Hacienda Crossings, Stoneridge Mall, great restaurants, etc< /review>< pics>

I decided to move to Wallis ranch because it's a gated community, close proximity to everything, and the kindred house. For the HOA fee versus what you get. It's really cheap. I think the price is relatively market price. Then again market price is what people are willing to pay for and there are quite a bit of people moving into the community.  My house ended up to be $337/sq ft. With a decent (small) back yard in the Taylor Morrison homes.

With the way that Dublin is growing. It's only a matter of time before it becomes the next Pleasanton or Fremont.</review>

This is a really cozy, nice, Mexican food spot. The staff is great and the food is a decent size for the money you pay. They also have happy hour specials that you should check out. I went during their lunch time and the specials are pretty good.<//Text>

If I could give a zero star I would!
I cannot believe the run around I was given for about a month with my security deposit. I called about 6 times in a month trying to talk to someone about a few on my security refund. Never kept in the loop about what was going on. The fee was bull and more a part of managing the property but obviously they don’t want to pay for anything. And it felt like “if we give her the run around maybe she’ll stop calling”.
I always kept Leonardo in the loop of what was going on but never complained or was a bad person about issues with the apartment. I never complained about get some run around for having a broken water heater for about 2-3 days. I never complained that there was water damage on a big part of my kitchen. I never complained when we had a closet with a huge hole to the outside which was brought up multiple times but never fixed.

When people talk about management company trying to take advantage of apartment renters, this is the company they have in mind.<//text>

Why are all the reviews from 11 months ago, generally about Pricsilla and from people with no background? I’ve lived here for years because it’s cheap. Recently new management has been proactive and friendly so I have hope. However past years we’ve had investation,  water from our neighbors shower come into ours for months, maintence putting holes into our walls, the heat doesnt keep our place warm at all, Warren was always super aggressive and they charged us for losing our rent checks. Multipppple times. You get what you pay for. If you can afford to treat yourself to a nicer place I’d recommend it. Most people haven’t stayed longer than a year.</review>

<review>I have been a resident of LA apartments for about a year and let me tell you that I don’t think I’ll be moving any time soon! Not only is it affordable with amenities, but the customer service is hard to beat. My apartment manager, Priscilla, is always super responsive and quick to schedule maintenance for any request. Any issue I’ve encountered, she has done her best to take care of it within a timely manner. My experience with the apartment has enhanced due to her contribution. Definitely would recommend!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

We have been living in an LA Apartments building for almost two years. Our landlord, Priscilla Alvarado has been the best landlord we have had in Los Angeles. Priscilla replies to us quickly if we have a service request, and things get fixed quickly. I appreciate that she also checks in monthly to make sure everything is good in our unit and to ensure we are still happy residents. I have enjoyed living in her building so much, that I also had my mother move into another unit in our building. Priscilla is great, and I highly recommend having her as a property manager.<//review>

La Apartments has been great over the last year and a half. They fix any problems that come up really quickly and have been great about keeping the buildings clean and well maintained. Warren in particular has been especially proactive about making sure their properties are great places to live. Best company I’ve rented from in LA hands down</review>

If I could give a zero star review I would. This leasing company is completely unprofessional. They overcharge for apartments that are not worthy of a high price bracket. Their office and maintenance team often ignored our requests to have a working stove (which never got fixed upon moving in). We moved out after 7 months and had to ask MULTIPLE times for our security deposit and itemized receipt forwarded. They claimed that they sent it twice and then charged me for the stop order when I finally got to physically pick it up 4 MONTHS LATER. They will try to scam you and it took almost taking this matter to Small Claims to have it resolved.

Do not move into any of their properties.< /Text>

Best customer service I have ever received. All the things I have ordered are delivered to me super quick and always complete. No complaints at all! Thank you Juan Valencia for always being friendly and efficient. It’s not often that you see such a passionate worker at such jobs. This guy really makes your ordering experience easy. Like you always say, “You got a friend in me !”< /Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Been living at my place for the past 3 years, and I love my home.  The building manager at Ave 53, Maria, is phenomenal.  She’s caring and quick to respond, and handles pressure very well.  Every request I have is immediately handled, without pushback and with reassuring concern.  Love her.

The rent could stand to be lower, though compared to the market price here, it’s pretty fair.  Street parking can be scarce, as is the norm with LA apartment living.

My neighbors are the loveliest people • we have a marvelous, diverse, and considerate community.  Appreciate my home very much.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Living in LA can make it very difficult to find the right apartment, but with the help of Priscilla Alvarado it couldn’t have been easier. She has the most positive energy and explains every detail of LA buildings. I loved the apartment! I put in a request to move in and my experience was perfect.</text>

Since moving to this apartment 3 years ago through LA Apartments, any issues that have came up have been solved, especially by our current manager, Raz. He has been very courteous and very easy to talk to. It makes things easy to know you can be comfortable talking to a manager who knows what he is doing. We are in the process of moving to a bigger place, but it has been a pleasant experience here overall.</Review>

Our apartment manager Priscilla is the best of all I have ever  met. Very  professional, caring, attentive, responsible and fast responsive. I believe all the renters that are under Priscilla’s management are really happy with her and highly satisfied like me.<//Text>

The fountains is a great place to live great space and I love the patio area it’s kept nice and clean. The manager Chyla is very nice and helpful and always answer any questions or concerns that I have and always keeps us informed. I love the pool it’s always kept nice and clean . And if I need something fixed it gets done right away . Bonus it’s dog friendly and that’s always a plus in my book.< /text>

Love my new apartment!!!! It's been about 3/4 months at The Fountains in Panorama City and I'm super happy. Cheyla, on-site manager, is awesome and easy to work with... she really cares about the security and cleanliness  of the building because there's always someone around maintaining the garden and general upkeep.< /Review>

I am a brand new resident here at 840 N Chestnut and I was referred by my daughter who recommended this place as my new home.I was so grateful to be warmly welcomed by Maria the Manager.She went out of her way to help me find parking for my bulky car.But that's just a little of what moves me to comment. I am a new widow and being alone in the world after 30 years of having a loving companion is very scary to say the least.She has been patient and has made me feel safe. Thank you for your choice in having Maria.Her own husband willing gave up his parking space for me thanks to HER COMING RIGHT OVER AS AFTER HOURS WHEN I WAS IN TEARS AND SHE FIXED IT. SHE'S A VERY POSITIVE PERSON AND ALWAYS AVAILABLE. I WAS  A PROPERTY MANAGER FOR 12 YRS IN  THE PAST WITH A CO AND HAVE SEEN ALL  TYPES.SO ITS NICE TO HAVE A GREAT MANAGER ,I KNOW I'M BLESSED TO BE HERE.
THANK YOU</Text>

<Review>Hello folks just rented myself a newly remodeled unit in the valley area near North Hollywood. Very impressed with the quality and craftsmanship of every detail in the unit. Because of my good credit they were able to give me 50% off the deposit. How beautiful is that. Anyways I thought Id put my own 2 cents on this about my experience. Service seems great. Lets see how it goes. I read some bad reviews on here but what business doesn't have a couple of bad ones right? As long as I see more positive reviews it works for me. Made a great decision. By the way the leasing agent who helped me out was a gentleman by the name of Raz.  You can ask for him. Hes a very nice man.</Review>< user_name>

<Text>I’ve lived here for 5 years and I rate these LA apartments 5 stars because when I lived there it was well maintained and clean from the outside. When issues needed to be resolved the manager, Pricilla Alvarado, always ensured to fix the problem as soon as possible.

<time>1554862005986< /time><rate>5< /rate><Text>3 months ago a man named Leonardo from LA Apartments helped me and my roommate get into my dream cute little cottage house in Los Angeles. I couldn't be more happier. I don't usually like to write reviews unless they really mean something. This is one of those moments. Everything Leonardo had promised me and my roommate he took care of. To be honest I would never want to deal another property management company ever again. There is so much fraud out there. I feel very well taken care of by LA Apartments. If I ever wanted to move to another location Leonardo told me he has over 300 buildings in LA that he could just transfer me to. That is the sense of security I feel that I need to have that they care. Thank you Leo you're the best.</Text>< Pics>

I like that it doesn’t matter if it’s morning or late in the evening she we always answer her phone and always helped us out 5 stars for her keep up the good work Karol from unit 212 👍< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rating>

My experience with L.A. apartments has been great. All my issues have always been resolved promptly. Leo is the best manager you can have. He took care of upgrading the buildings, adding parking, assigning designated parking spots, tending to each tenants individual needs, prompt service with his crew. Helped me when I was ready to move into a new rental. Absolutely will recommend L.A. apartments and the chestnut building to live in and have Leo as your manager for a great living experience. Plus you will be close to tons of good restaurants, bars, and night life, but also a quiet retreat to your apartment tucked away near South Pasadena. Thank you Leo for allowing me and my family to have a great experience while living there and always taking care of our unit whenever we needed anything. You're the best.<//review>

<Review>LA apartments are the greatest! Very professional staff and courteous, they really care! I especially wanna thank Maritza Lucer for being an amazing person/manager. I’ve been at my building for years (El Encanto). Anytime I call or need something she is 100% on top of it and takes care of it same day with a smile! If you’re looking for affordable apartments that provide a safe and clean environment then you’ve come to the right place. 10 stars!< /Review><resp>None< /resp></record>

<Review>In reference to 21041 Bryant Street, Canoga Park apartment(Bryants Apartment). Beware and run, Ieft this apartment due to BED BUGS , COCKROACHES  infestation..yuck, that's the least, not to mention no hot water for days to weeks, poor management and unprofessional staff/workers who only care for the $$$. With ongoing renovations which is unnecessary, unskilled workers(repairs/construction) who doesn't know what they're doing and cause me of not going to work to oversee them since there's NO manager on site ...for months. With the Covid starting last February, 2020, and the day I was leaving and after the safer at home mandate, workers are not wearing mask. With the new management and price increase, please spend your hard earned money somewhere pleasant, clean and has responsible management. Its now worth it!</Review>< Pics>

<text>I was a tenant for LA Apartments for 2 years. I lived in “The Fountains” the area with the trees and fountains was just beautiful it that was love at first sight. When i came in for a tour thats when i met the property manager Cheyla. She greeted me with a smile answered all my questions she made me feel at home. I applied that same day and with in a couple of hours she had me approved. She made the whole process nice and easy for me. I had to move out due to a job offer out of state but if i ever go back to California she is the first person i am reaching out to. She never lost that smile always greeted me with politeness and was always available for me.
LA Apartments you guys have a good one!!!< /text>< pics>

All I have to say is that we have the best manager that actually cares if we are happy with our experience. His name is Leo and since we have lived on the property that we live on; he has drastically improved the property and been attentive to any repairs that we needed and speedily.  He has made us feel welcome yet respects our privacy as well. With so many transitions in the housing industry, I know that I can be grateful for what I have here. Thank you.<//review>

Don't understand how some people can write a negative review about them. My experience has been nothing but a pleasant one. I'm really close now to work and school so I don't have to drive that far.

The apartment is not only affordable but also the prompt and exceptional service any tenant  can anticipate from their landlords.My manager, Priscila Alvarado is one of the reasons I’m still a tenant. She is very proactive when it comes to taking care of any maintenance issues. She works very hard to maintain cleanliness in the premises. She is very understanding, patient and always there to assist with any lease related issue(s) I have had so far. I travel a lot and I feel safe even when I’m out for a month or two because Priscila keeps the area safe. She’s indeed an epitome of a good property manager.< /Review>< gmapID>

The unit I've lived in has been a pleasant experience. It is a very clean unit and property is very well maintained. Cheyla who is my apartment manager at 7717 ventura canyon is always quick to respond and always very accommodating to my needs. She is on top of any issues and is always very friendly. Nothing but great things to say and would definitely recommend!</review>

I stayed in this apartment last year in 2018 and just recently moved out due to my job relocation. I must say when management changed from Moss & Company to LA Apartments, I'm sure the entire complex was grateful to have Ms. Karol Pineda as our new property manager. She was so professional and sweet. Anytime there was a problem she was quick to resolve the issue in a timely manner. Any concerns were always addressed no matter what the circumstance was. It was also nice to see her keep the property looking nice with the new renovations to the outside, fresh flowers, and always having it maintained, looking presentable. Ever since she has managed the property, it has been the icing on the cake for this being a great place to stay at and if it was for my job relocation I would be staying another year. There are never any disturbances, disruptions, or anything at this apartment complex. Everyone seems to mind their own business and for the most part it’s a quiet complex. I highly recommend La Apartment's Sepulveda Apartments!</Text>

So far one of the best experiences with a management company; my partner and I are very happy in our place knowing very well that our management company is non discriminative and does not lack communication skills when it comes to the property. Even before moving, as we were looking at the apartment, a neighbor stopped us to let us know that it’s a great place and everyone is very friendly and didn’t say a single negative thing about management. Leo has been really good to us and it’s a relief because over the last ten ears I’ve learned that good property managers are rare.</text>

I like living here a lot, the building I live in well maintained. Plus they’re making upgrades all the time to meet the needs of there tenants. Like adding more parking, adding extra lighting for safety. Anytime I text my manager about an issue he is on it ASAP! (Thank you Leo!)< /Text>

The best thing about The Fountains is Cheyla the manager.  I have lived here 3 years and gone through a lot of ups and downs but Cheyla comes through for me thick and thin.  She is much more to me than a manager.  I count her as my friend.<//Text>

LA Apartments, or CDF, or “Custom Designed Furs” (shady), makes penny pinching cuts that have negatively effected the living conditions for tenants. They also raise the rent as much as they legally can every year without making any positive changes to the building or facilities.

Fortunately, our building manager, David, is very friendly and always takes care of issues promptly and compassionately.  He has gone above and beyond to help me out before and I’m grateful we have a guy like him around.</review>

I could see myself living in a  Comunnity such as this for a very long time. It has exaclly what I want and that is whatever i need in a walking distance.  L.A Apartments are great 👍  as a current tenent highly recommended... L.A Apartments are the best.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I live at the building on Delano St Van Nuys.
Couldn’t have a better bldg manager-Prissilia Alverado-she answers your concerns in a very timely manner and repairs are made ASAP.  Great customer service!</Review>

There office staff is rude and unhelpful.  They took over our apartment building one month and, literally, the next day after becoming new owners raised our rent $300.  I was so unsatisfied with there level of service that I moved out as soon as I found a place... Now they are not returning my deposit even though I returned the apartment in great condition.<//text>< pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><text>My experience in the Winnetka Leadwell st area apartments has not been a good one. I've been a tenant for 2 years and at first it was tranquil but as a norm of living with a lot of people, issues and complaints will arise. The on site management lack responsibility when issues and complaints are communicated. I do not feel like the apartment is advertised correctly "luxury apartments" when the service and cosmetic look in the building do not follow suit. A major issue of mine is management response time for roaches infestations. They had to wait until all tenants created a mob like document demanding fumigation.

The apartment walkways consistently have  dog feeeces. Another of the issue that management has turned a blind eye to. I just think they need to hire better onsite managers.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I have had bad experiences with them before. When looking for apartments I avoid them and this is the bad luck that I have.

Service is terrible and they overcharge for sure. My building now and before with them have never been clean or in order.

The worst leasing agency in LA. They will charge you extra every month, raise the rent every other month and they deducted 600 $ from my deposit even though i handed my apartment back in a flawless shape.
LA apartments are the worst when it comes customer service, or logistics.
They will.make sure they rip you off as much as they can.

Don't deal with them< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The managers are incompetent to give your complaints and do nothing about it in order to keep their work, they do not want to put order or enforce the rules regarding the parking of the building here where I live, there are many tenants who have a staff of 5 or 4 parking spaces. and many of them do not pay extra for these parking lots until the visitors are always busy when the parking limit is 1 hour 😠😠😠😠

(Original)
Los mánager son incompetentes das tus quejas y no hacen nada al respecto  con tal de mantener su trabajó   no quieren poner orden  ni hacer respetar las reglas  respecto a los estacionamientos del edificio aquí donde yo vivo ahí  muchos inquilinos que  tienen asta de a 5 o 4 estacionamientos y muchos de ellos no pagan extra por dichos estacionamientos  asta los de visitas  siempre están ocupados cuándo el límite de parking es de 1 hora  😠😠😠😠</review>

The food was excellent! To make it even better the waitress/cook was super nice with a great sense of humor. Only food truck so far in Albuquerque that delivers the food to your table.<//review>

Sometimes I think I may have some Mexican in me!  I love Mexican food and tacos.  Probably shouldn't but could eat tacos everyday!

Los Carnalitos makes really good Al Pastor tacos!  Very rich flavor in each bite!  Order 3 with a soda, a full meal!</Text>

This place is delicious, the variety they have in such a small truck blows my mind. Tripa and suadero are great and reminds me so much of Mexico. I wish they had tables to sit but I don't mind standing. Worth it!< /Text>

The pastor is top notch!  Really nice people working there.  Plenty of parking.  No tables or seating area.  Can stand and eat at the side of the truck.< /text>

A hidden gem lunch truck with authentic and not your run of the mill fare. The gringa taco with pineapple inside is a genius move to mix in some tropical sweetness with the spice.</Review>

<Text>Best taco truck in the peninsula, hands down. With different meat selections and cooked Mexico City style your tummy will leave happy and satisfied. I love their Al Pastor and Suadero tacos. Dont forget to try their aguas frescas. A must if you want a taste of Mexican street food.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808fa3efbd18b155:0xe7710e30f6d5baef< /Gmap_id>< time>

I had a Horchata Paleta.  This store isn't as good as the store on W Texas Street.  They don't rotate their ice cream flavors.< /Review>

Friendly staff, great flavors in their ice creams.
The flavors lean towards the Mexican side especially in the chocolate and vanilla flavors, slightly cinnamon in the chocolates and a richer vanilla.</review>

<Review>The elote preparado was horrible. The elote tasted like it was sitting in water. The cheese that was added, melted. Felt like I was eating a quesadilla with Monterey cheese. I got 2 oreo paletas.  Also not good. No cookie flavor, tasted like someone blended a cookie with water, then froze it.<//Review>< UserId.>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Yum! I will be back with friends or by myself. Cute n'Clean joint with friendly and knowledgeable staff that answer every ice cream Q&A with a smile, while giving you samples of Every Flavor you want to try.
Several tables and the large picture window provide a great place to take a break from a long day.
I got "Arroz con Leche" to go. Big mistake. Talk about distracted driving! Next time I need to put in trunk, or eat there.
This store is not affiliated with a similar shop  @ West Texas next to Nations.
A creative menu, unique flavors, plus the genuinely attentive and fun staff make
La Michoacána of Orange a
Go To for every Fairfield Foodie.🌈<//Text>< Pics>

Fresh fruit. I love their raspados, especially the ones from natural fruit or fruit flavor not syrup.
Also they have a good variety of smoothies, juices and malts.
Definitely I will recommend to go by in a hot day to get a refreshing raspado< /Text>

Paid almost $20 for a tamarind raspado that had WAY too much syrup with so many seed particles I had to throw it out. I also ordered a piñanada and got a mangonada I didn't want. Pretty disappointed.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) According to me, I called by phone so I could pick up the order as soon as it arrived. It turned out that the girl who took my order over the phone (she didn't sound so happy, by the way) hadn't done anything. I arrived and told the girl that I had ordered by phone and she charged me for my order and she told me that in a moment it was ready and you must not even call by phone. The lady who charged me, super nicer than the other tall young woman who was there, even apologized at least for the delay. I asked for a bionic without a banana, it always tastes delicious and they have always done it well for me. I also asked for a shave that by the way they only make it one size (large) and it tasted very sweet and a ball of ice that I couldn't even enjoy as shaved.

(Original)
Según yo llame por teléfono para poder recoger la orden en cuanto llegara. Resultó que la tipa que tomó mi orden por teléfono (por cierto no se escuchaba tan contenta) no había hecho nada. Llegue y le dije a la muchacha que había ordenado por teléfono y me cobro por mi orden y me dijo que en un momento estaba listo y has de cuenta que ni llame por teléfono. La señorita que me cobró, súper más amable que la otra alta joven que estaba ahí, hasta se disculpó por lo menos por la tardanza. Pedí un biónico sin plátano, siempre sabe muy rico y siempre me lo han hecho bien. También pedí un raspado que por cierto solo lo hacen de un tamaño (grande) y me supo muy dulce y una bola de hielo que ni lo pude disfrutar como raspado.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMibzFErEbV45-rqbgTayfVynu2d8a9Knk9KUOA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqW2uQdMtWcgxGgg7GSIZ-hsGVbeJuRzk91Nda=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxlRLTaY8PH4CLhL56zBc6x6Rl0t3IXt7cjTQk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfR9ea4oHWvLSh7W5Y_aUflAWE-NImUWzD4OXl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808515d235a68d91:0x656a8692ef857aa0<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Was Great! I had Beyond Avocado Tacos and order was ready before I got my drink. Place was veeerrry clean.

My only reason for not giving FIVE stars was the way East bound traffic entered and exited the place. 😎😎</Text>< Resp>

<Review>I had to pull around to the front to wait for my food. I was the only one in line! I got out to use the restroom & they wouldn't allow me to! I'm a female & can't do what men can!!! Not happy to make someone wait for there to go food and refuse to let them use a restroom! What if I wanted to just wash my hands!!!!!!??????

<Text>This is one of our favorite Del Taco locations, we love their salsa bar here!!!!! Food is always accurate and they label special orders so they are easy to distinguish.  Great vegetarian options - I could eat their Beyond Tacos every day of the week and never get tired of them.  Try their app if you want occasional free items and useful coupons!</Text>< pics>

<review>The reason I put 3 stars, is because sometimes they put way too much salt in their food. Service is 5 stars, quick service, friendly service.</review>< date>

<text>Messed up my order twice, served me last (after other people behind us), took 12 minutes at a slow time.

I'm ashamed to have loved this Del Taco. Do NOT go there during night shift. Such a disappointment.

EDIT: Oh my gosh, they screwed up my burger- even more. The Double Del is now a single Patty with double.. bun? There is nothing double here.

The burger bun had MOLD!!! NEVER again!!!!< /text>< resp>

Staff is polite but they always forget part of my food and they take FOREVER. I'm good at checking my order but my husband isn't and by the time we get home, were not going back out. Definitely one of the worst Del tacos due to this. Del Taco in Wildomar is always on point.< /Review>

Great value for the fresh food. There is no warmer tray here. You order it gets cooked fresh. The customer service is always greeting you with a smile. This is one of the best ran Del Taco around and will be back there soon.< /review>

Consitantly gets your order wrong. Almost every time we go thru the drive thru at least one this is incorrect. Today it was 2 things, one was caught before we left and the other when we got home.
Ridiculous.<//review>

<Review>I come here a few times a week sometimes it’s super fast sometimes it’s slow it all just depends but don’t stop if your in a hurry. Today they were backed up but the lady at the window was super nice which is always refreshing. Customer service is everything and it really keeps people coming back. Thank you del taco for your yummy and affordable bean and cheese burritos they are life ! 💙💙💙🌯🌯</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9gpNBY4gM8taLLMuvsxDC6btV5oUFFnVDuL75=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

All i have to say is the new people that work at del taco definitely dont no how to cook. They messed up my order they burnt my fries and gave it to me like that and charged me to get the things they forgot to make but already paid for and other customers were not  so happy about there food either. There were couple of other people returning there things to and the cook was getting mad and nobody puts hair net on and touches there hair and cook like that and its not the first time they messed up my order.
SO I DONT HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</review>

I'm not sure why Del Taco only gives you one small container of green sauce when you order. I ordered 25 dollars worth of food and they asked what type of sauce I wanted...I said the green sauce. When I got home there was only one small container of green salsa verde in my 3 bags of food. I got in my car and drove back to Del Taco to get more sauce. A week prior I the same thing happened with the sauce and I simply didn't go back. So this is a pattern. So sad.<//Text>

My favorite place to go to get high quality low price Mexican food. I'm obsessed with their chicken soft tacos and strawberry lemonade and they are just a dollar each! The service is fast, the staff is always nice and helpful. Every time I go in, the restaurant and tables are clean and ready. I absolutely LOVE this place and recommend to everyone.<//Text>

<Review>Bean and cheese burritos are delicious, beans are made fresh every day. I always ask for the tortilla well done, makes the burrito taste that much better. Strawberry lemonade is also awesome, and its only $1. If you are on a budget, you can eat good for a few dollars. Even better if you use the coupons they send thru the mail😉</Review><time>1533363585474</time><name>Zeny Villalobos< /name><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x80dc829c4e10c9b5:0x562bdb5401413a79< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

<Text>The best thing about these restaurants, verging on an affectionately accepted foible, is that they’re always out of something on the menu. This was true at three of the four places I visited, but they had everything I asked for at this hot, smoky fun cranny, colorfully decorated with the flags of the region and the requisite portrait of Bob Marley. Admittedly, I went for lunch, and kept my order simple: chicken tacos ($9.95) and a beef burritos ($12.78). The former, which included generous chunks of chicken in luxurious hit sause with rice and stuff (what we would call red beans), was the delicious definition of comfort food. The beef stuffing in the latter was maybe a little spicier than my palate prefers, though the golden tortilla  dough was satisfying.
The soda pop, looks and tastes like neither Champagne nor dirty cola, but is a great way to wash everything down.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The food was quickly made. The burritos are two times as big as I normally get from other locations. Service was quick and friendly.< /text>

<review>This location has a lot to be desired. Seems like the crew tonight needed more training. The manager was losing her s**t and trying not to take it out on customers but failing. There is another Del Taco about 5 minutes away that is WAY better.</review>< pictures>

I cannot eat things made with beef, so I used to love your Turkey tacos, but now I can't get them and you chicken taco is awful, too small, too slimy, and to tasteless.  It would be better served on a hard shell, don't  grind the meat, shred it instead.  Keep the lettuce, tomatoes, cheese the same as the beef taco.</Review>

This Del Taco on Clinton Kieth has a fresh Salsa Bar for your food which is awesome. Although there are other Del Taco's closer to me it is worth an extra few minutes drive to go there just for the salsa instead of the hot sauce​ packets others have. If you like Del Taco, this one is highly recommend.<//review>

The iced coffee wasn’t bad actually. Gross burrito unfortunately. Simple beans, rice and sour cream that seemed to be soggy, flavorless. The staff was fine but they seemed overworked and a simple order took over 15 minutes, which is rather long. I wouldn’t return.< /Review>

<Review>This Del Taco is not nearly as good as the other one 5 mins down the road.  My 1/2 burrito was 1/4 pound at most and my epic queso burrito was 90% fries almost no meat and cheese to the point it tasted dry.

Stood at the counter looking at the menu for over five minutes before deciding to just leave. One customer ahead of me who's done ordering, but cashier continues conversation instead of helping me.

Took a long time for the cashier to take our order even though the restaurant was not busy. It seems like they prioritize drive thru too much. Also, all of the chairs are extremely dirty.< /review>

<Text>Andrew was awesome! He was friendly and professional and even kept a smile on his face while his manager was rude to him and other another worker. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the manager was rude to her employees in front of customers... But 5 stars to Andrew!<//Text>< time>

This place is pretty constant the only thing I would recommend is asking for the fries to be cooked a little longer as the last few times the fries were undercooked, but other than that they are pretty good.< /Review>

<text>Hot this drive thru twice, the 2nd time giving them the benefit of the doubt. But never again. Literally SAT in the drive thru line for about 10 min the first time, and 18 min the 2nd time! 18 min! There's no excuse. The food was also cold both times!

I ordered 2 cheeseburgers and fries and quesadilla for my three kids (all of them are under 8 years old) and burritos for myself and my wife, and soda drink. We ate our food in there. Later, in the evening my one of the kids said about hurting tummy. Later, she threw up several time. Then, a little letter,  other 2 kids started complaining for their tummies. They had same, threw up and had diarrhea. All of my kid had stomach pain and diarrhea and vomiting whole night, Mostly my wife did not sleep, she guard them b/c they threw up whole and cried for stomach pain whole night. One of my kid still in the bed this morning complaining for pain in tummy.  Early morning I and my wife had diarrhea and nausea. My diarrhea was supper waterish in the morning but I barely handled my nausea. Trust me, please do not visit there and buy poison for yourself and for your family (if you have).<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>
