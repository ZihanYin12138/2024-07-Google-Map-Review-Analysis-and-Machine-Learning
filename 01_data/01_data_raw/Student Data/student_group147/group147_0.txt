I ordered yellow roses. Yellow roses represent friendship. I also paid extra for a “elegant” bouquet so that it would have baby breath in it to look nicer. Finally, I ordered a teddy bear. Flowers die and I wanted the recipient to have a keepsake.

They were going to my stepdaughter for her graduation that I could not be at. She was sent red roses, as if she was a lover. The roses had ugly huge green leaves and some purple stuff that looked like baby breath. She also didn’t receive the teddy bear. She received generic chocolates literally from Walmart. Not to mention, she is allergic to chocolates.

I tried sending in an email to complain but their system wasn’t accepting my order number. I had to call. They offered to send out what I correctly ordered...because it wasn’t possible to do that the first time. I accepted. But then the representative said it wouldn’t be delivered for another two days. So they deliver the wrong item, on the day I paid for it to be delivered and now it’s going to take another two days!? I told the rep that was unacceptable and what else can I be offered. They said $20 off my next purchase. I said “Nope! I don’t want that! I will not ever use you all again!” Then she offered an additional 6 roses for free. I said “well if another 6 roses means it’s not going to take an additional 2 days, then yes please.” Of course not! So I asked for a refund. They said they could only refund me 50%.

Never use this company. They are horrid and a waste of money. Flowers are not cheap. So take your money somewhere else.<//Text>

<review>I was very unhappy with my purchase. I paid a little over $60 for my total purchase and the flowers I received were of such bad quality and nor as described. The flowers are basically wilted/dead.

This is my 2nd time I've ordered from 1-800-Flowers this year and both times were not great experiences. I've attached pics of what I ordered & what I received. I will not be placing any future orders. Terrible quality!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUXicQzPAEWInIiRDszIYxJEFALz_rvx15eSYm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQSMA7OLaxXguUTn2dBrCOeUAJ9O8p60Xm2APY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! I placed an online order at 10am for same day delivery, it was promised by 6pm since it was a business address. It was my best friend's last day at her job and I wanted to send her Congrats Flowers so it was important they arrived that day. I paid the $18 same day delivery fee and at 6:15pm I still had not received a text saying they were out for delivery, the business they were supposed to be delivered to closes at 6pm so I called 1800flowers to cancel my order. After being on hold for over 20 minutes, somebody answered and I explained what was going on, she said they would be delivered tomorrow and I said no since my friend will no longer be at that company so the customer service lady offered me a 50 percent refund and 50 percent off my next order. I said NO, my flowers were not delivered as promised and I want a full refund as I will never use this company again and never received my products. Why should I only get half my money back??? She put me on hold to speak with her supervisor, when she returned she said that I would get my full refund and a confirmation email stating that my order was refunded, this was 2 days ago, I still have not received my refund or a confirmation email! This whole experience is just a great reminder to shop local!</review>

TLDR; Poor customer service, outsourced phone support, terrible overseas connection. Website and automated phone service did not update when delivery failed (no reason given as to why it failed, recipient was home). Delivery date has come and gone, recipient still hasn't received replacement order yet.

I wish I could leave a "0-star" rating. I called their service twice to ensure they had the correct information, including the gate code to the recipient's apartment complex (technically speaking, I called -four- times, but two of those connections were very poor, and the customer service is outsourced to India, so it was difficult to understand the customer service representative between the technical difficulties and the language barrier). I was assured it was still pending delivery and I would be notified upon delivery or updated if there was an issue.

Skip ahead, the delivery date has passed, nothing was delivered. I was not notified (neither by call, text, email, website tracker -- nothing). When I checked the site and called the automated tracker, both said it was still pending. I called customer service (twice this time due to poor connections to an overseas call center), and was informed that there was an issue with delivery, but they were unable to tell me why because the local florist they contracted didn't tell them.

If I had not called, I would not have been notified and the website would have continued to say pending until the order was eventually canceled. They offered to cancel the original order and arrange a replacement "at no added cost". For my trouble they offered me a $20 voucher towards -future- purchases, which is most assuredly never going to happen. This was one of the worst customer experience experiences I've ever had. As of today, my recipient still has no flowers.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I will NEVER do business with them again! When I placed the order it took about 30 minutes,  but I really wanted to get something special for my best friend.  I had to repeat my message a few times, but after it was read back to me I was ok with it ( ONLY because I could not see the Horrific spelling errors).  Once I seen the email with order details, I was horrified that my order would be delivered. I called as soon as I seen that, and I was told they fixed the grammer. I stated I wanted to see the change,  or I would have to cancel my order. I was on the phone for 1.5 hours trying  to cancel my order, and I was finally told they would cancel. The next day I received an email stating it was being delivered via Fed Ex??? I am extremely upset,  and embarrassed by the bad grammer. I don't even want to give a  one star review.</Review>

Horrible horrible customer service!! Received a free shipping coupon but wouldn’t work on-line for some reason. Contacted customer service and was placed on hold for an hour. After being placed on hold for an hour, the customer service informed me they couldn’t help. I requested to be transferred to a supervisor and was placed on hold for an additional 30 minutes just to be told they couldn’t help me either. Unbelievable. I was not surprised to see a 1.5 rating on google. I’m surprised they are still in business with that kind of customer service. Wish I could rate a zero.< /Review>

When I called customer service the lady just kept on saying I have a delivery scheduled for the May 1.  I explain to her I already received the delivery and I would like to file a complaint because They too early and to roses are already getting brown. I don’t even think she wrote the complaint information down. I should have definitely reviewed the comments before ordering. The way the flowers look I could’ve just as easily went to a farmers market and picked up some flowers that would look better. I will NEVER order from them again and I will be sure to tell my friends and relatives about my experience with 1800 flowers. Terrible customer service because they didn’t even try to resolve the problem, i’m surprised they’re still in business!< /Text>< user_id>

Order flowers on-line for Halloween. I received an email a day later stating these were not able to be delivered to the address and that a "replacement" arrangement was going to be sent. The replacement was nothing like what I had originally ordered and I was not happy with what they had selected. I called their 1-800 number and spoke to a very nice lady who told me that my selection could not be delivered to the address I was sending these to. She suggested that I pick an alternative. While still on the line I picked something else. She told me the original order was still going to be delivered but I would not be charged for it (flowers did come and I was told they were starting to wilt on the day they arrived). She CONFIRMED my second selection can and will be delivered to that address. I checked my email the following day and once again they changed my order to a "replacement". I called a second time and spoke with someone else. Same story about not being able to send to the address. I canceled the order completely. Never again will I use 1-800 Flowers. I now have a $20 gift card that I will never use. It's not worth it.</review>

NOTE: This is my experience using their website and not the actual location.

First time using 1-800-Flowers.  I was thinking to myself, wow its gotta be a hectic supply chain to get people exactly what they order since there are so many different varieties of flowers!

I ordered Weds night for a Friday delivery.  The order was not delivered on time.  I recommend not using them if you need flowers on a specific day/time.  Good chance they will fall short.

UPDATE:  I emailed them as I thought that would be the most effective way to get ahold of them.  Sure enough, I received a response that night (11pm).  They gave me a $20 coupon to use and also sent out a replacement order because I was concerned with the condition of the flowers since it was projected to be delivered Mon (shipped the thurs before).  Upgraded my star rating to 5 stars for their outstanding customer service. Ill take it as a fluke that I had a delayed order due to the pandemic.  Ill give them another go.<//text>

I waited all day for my husband’s order and we never received it. They delivered it elsewhere. They refused to send a new order. The refund I’m told will take nearly 3 1/2 weeks and I paid over $70. Ruined his special day! I will never use this service again.<//text>

Ordered over $300 for flowers to my family across the country.  Only 1 order in NJ was satisfactory delivered. The other 3 in California were a disaster.  One order was delivered on time but did not reflect anything close to what was ordered.
Another delivery was left on the porch sometime Christmas day on to pelted by rain and wind that left it ruined. The 3rd order was never delivered!
As with most companies dealing with call centers or email, don't expect any response or resolution.😡</text>

<review>Would only use in despite times... I ordered a rainbow bouquet which is exactly what it sounds... a rose dyed in the rainbow colors each petal a different color/faded to another.  Well I ordered it which is not cheap.. but I needed it the next day. Picked the time and date and they arrived a little late but day I requested BUT delivered pink roses.   Luckily she liked them or i would have made a big deal about it but I was extremely disappointed i paid extra for rainbow when I could have paid half the price... I was going to complain but googled and read their terms and they do say if we don't have what u want in the time u want it they will substitute it with the closest thing... its a terrible system and if I would have known that before hand I wouldn't have wasted my money... also u should have an OPTION  for substitution or REFUND!!! I could see a lawsuit!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Since my grandmother won't have another 87th birthday, I will never forgive them for ruining her day.  Because of COVID, I couldn't see her today and sent her flowers.  They were never delivered, although I received a delivery confirmation.  Their customer service phone number hung up on me after waiting on hold for almost 30 minutes and their chat feature got stuck asking me for my email over and over again.  I spent a lot of money to make sure my grandmother knew she was loved today and got nothing but stress.  Find a local florist that you can trust, do not use this service!  Best part was the note on the delivery conformation: "Please note: Your gift was expertly crafted and delivered by one of our local shops, who put their passion into every order."  Delivered expertly to whom??  LOL</review>< Name>

I've used their service a number of times over the years.  I'm always disappointed by what they deliver but figure it is what you get from an online flower retailer.  This year they managed to butcher my anniversary though - 3 times.

First, my original order was delivered a day early AND was the wrong arrangement.  You can imagine my wife's delight when a random bunch flowers that look like they were pulled from the floor and stuffed into a vase showed up with a note from me.   So, I called 1-800-FLOWERS customer service and was that the flowers were not delivered (because the florist can game the system by delivering early and not submitted the notification until the next day) and that they were contacting the florist and that a wonderful arrangement would assuredly be delivered the following day- which it was not.

I called customer service again.  They refunded 50% of my money and told me that a new amazing arrangement would be delivered the following Tuesday from a different florist, etc... The flowers again showed up a day early (not as traumatic this time considered the anniversary issue was blown) and were in awful shape.  I reached out to customer service again, wasting more time.  Got through the story, confirmed my order info, and was asked to wait a couple of minutes which she checks on the order details, etc. only to be stranded on hold and eventually "disconnected".

I'm done... just done.

FYI - MIRACLE FLOWERS in Folsom, CA.  Don't use them.  They are the ones that delivered the garbage first arrangement on the wrong day and did not report until the following day.  They ultimately started the downhill spiral.  All they had to do was what was asked on them...</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I ordered flowers for a birthday a couple days ago, and what was delivered looked nothing like what I ordered. It was half the size, different color, different flowers, and the balloon that it came with was filthy, it had dirt all over it for some reason. I was so embarrassed. The look of disappointment on the recipients face was heart wrenching. I called the 1800-flowers to explain the situation and request a refund, after being kept on hold for over 35 minutes the agent hung up. I called the next day and the day after that with the same exact experience. Today I called 4 times and after 2 hours I finally spoke with an agent that said since it had been 4 days since the flowers were delivered I would not qualify for a refund. So frustrating!!! I requested to speak with a supervisor and they put me on hold again for 20 minutes before hanging up again! Honestly one of the worst customer service experiences I have had from any company. I started recording the calls after the first couple times that I was hung up on and would be happy to share it with anyone at your company, if they care to see how your agents are treating customers. 1800flowers turned what was suppose to be a fun happy experience to sad disappointing one.< /Review><user>105438282540402687156</user><GmapID>0x809ada3a07ea9c41:0x89124c9050e31cab< /GmapID><Name>Amir Danaei</Name><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>1</Rate><pictures>None</pictures>< date>

<Review>1800flowers not a good experience and won’t be using them again!! They are lucky they got 1 Star and not 0stars! I had the WORST experience! I had to speak to an actual person because it was a last minute order and the website wouldn’t take my order. The agent, Raymond didn’t even take the delivery address or verify my email. (Hopefully if an email was sent whoever got it, doesn’t have my banking information now!!) Raymond was working from home & distracted. We could hear kids in the background and what sounded like someone cooking in the kitchen. When I called back the next day to find out why I Was double charged for my order the woman said I would get a call from their accounting department at 9am, but I didn’t!! After 3 days of begging I finally got an email confirming my order after speaking to Bel and telling her I would be reviewing them online. The only GOOD thing is that the person receiving the flowers did get their flowers on time and thought they were pretty and the delivery person was polite. IM NOT HAPPY and will NOT be ordering from them again!! 😡<//Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< userid>

Florist in Folsom, CA.  I ordered flowers on a Friday to be delivered in Rancho Murietta on Monday and it shows it came from a florist in Folsom.  I received an email that the flowers WERE DELIVERED (not in transit) but DELIVERED at 4pm and she did not receive them until 8pm.  The flowers were cute but nothing like the size of the picture.  As far as 1800Flowers.com you can't even contact a person, there is a chat which is a not a person but an auto-reply to whatever question they give you.  I tried calling the phone number and it tells you to go online to order or check status, that's it.  I have one more delivery that needs to go out on Thurs. which I contemplated on cancelling.  This florist that is in another part of Northern CA will determine if I continue using 1800 Flowers again.</text>

Worst experiences ordering flowers. Signed up for a passport so I could get free shipping for a year. Every time I've ordered flowers online there is no where to apply the passport number so I have to waste time calling and reording through customer service on the phone, who out of the 5 orders I've placed on the phone with them, they always misspell words in the recipients name or address or message.  I try to modify online to correct their errors and the corrections aren't made so I need to make ANOTHER call to try and make corrections before delivery.  Waste of time company. Use any other flower service. This one is AWFUL. And FYI I never post on anything.< /text>

Very heart breaking experience long story short paid a lot of money and paid for express same day delivery early in the morning. They gave false promises and kept telling me they were out delivering the flowers and course it never made it. I am disappointed because this was a moment of bring somebody some type of joy for a tough passing situation.  To make matters worse the representative told me the florist had the phone turned off and only could be reached by voice-mail. Sad very sad</Review>

< Review>
The completely botched my Mother's Day order for the 2nd year in a row.  I ordered flowers for my mother-in-law 6 days before Mother's Day. I suddently get an email, 3 days before, saying "a replacement has been made" and "order cannot be modified." They never emailed me to ASK me what an acceptable replacement would be! Even worse, the replacement was a FRIENDSHIP COMFORT CANDLE. For my mother-in-law. Not even any type of flower. I gave them another chance after last year's no-delivery debacle, but this is a TREND. Never again.</Review>

<Review>Ordered flowers. Wasn't in stock didn't bother contacting me till I called because the delivery never came in. They took an extra 5 days to ship out the flowers they suggested was in stock. Arrived with broken glass everywhere in the box. Would give a -5 stars.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I placed an order of flowers to send to my daughter. It was suppose to be delivered to her place of employment by 5. It was not delivered. I called customer service on hold for an hour then when they picked up they hung up on me. I will make sure everyone I know whom wants to order flowers not to order from this place. Had to call again and supposedly the it’s closed now. This is ridiculous<//Review>

<Text>Ordered 24 lavender roses for my mom’s birthday. She lives across the country from me and I was happy that they delivered on time, but they sent the completely wrong flowers and they were the most hideous red/white flowers so I was very upset. You would think that you would get what you pay for when you pay $70 for a bouquet of flowers. Called customer service and they said the best they could do was give me a small discount and a coupon for my next purchase. Do you think I’m ever going to purchase from them again? Never. Period. So disappointed!<//Text><name>Carolyn Newell<//name>< pics>

This site is a scam,  I ordered a cake for my BFF birthday, it said shipping was $14.99 then after I went through the paypal part it added an additional $14.99. Then when I called within 15 minutes of order they said there’s nothing they could do except charge me $19.99 for shipping for a year, some Passport program. I said no I don’t use it enough not worth it, just cancel my order she yelled over me and said she would refund and add $19.99 if I give her my CC #. I said no. There was so much noise in background and I was so upset I hung up. Now they are emailing saying it was a charge for expedited delivery, well it should be more clear and be up front before you pay.  I tried to cancel online within 30 minutes and it said I couldn’t cancel. Terrible company. $30 shipping on top of a small $42 cake.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I ordred a set of flowers on 5 December to be delivered on 23 December. On 23 December I checked the status of my order and realised they have not been shipped out yet. I called them that day and they responded that "the order has been delayed and rest assured the order will be delivered by 25 December." I checked the status of my order on 25 December and determined that they still not have been delivered. I called again and they told me they can get my order shipped "perhaps by the following week" and that they will give me a coupon for my next order for my trouble. I demand a refund and the cancellation of my order and they tell me they will only refund 50% of my order. I threaten to report them to BBB and they agree to refund 100% of my money and cancel my order. I requested a confirmation email for the cancellation of the order and never recieved one. Do not order anything from 1-800-Flowers or you will be extremely disappointed.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I am only giving this company one-star because I have to give at least one star in order to leave a review. 1-800 Flowers is the absolute worst flower company that you could ever go through please save yourself the grief and the worry and the money lost and Just do something local. So just a little detail on what happened to me I placed an order online through 1-800 Flowers. When I place my online order their online portal gave me an error code. I then went to my bank my online banking and I saw that they had charged me twice for the original one dozen of roses. I then contacted them by phone or a CSR assisted me with completing my order and assured me that my other previous money that was taken would be reversed within 3 to 5 business days. I then wake up the next day to not only the order that I completed over the phone with the CSR on my account but an additional pending charge for $51.44 and 1-800 Flowers has no idea why. It has been pending for 5 days and they have failed hold to reverse my money so long story short I spent a total of $124 on one dozen of roses.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>Horrible service!! What I ordered was completely different to what was delivered. Emailed customer service and they promised to re-deliver the next day. No delivery. Long story short after back and forth emails they promised again to re-deliver on next business day. Different arrangement AGAIN! Worse than the first one. Will never use this service again!!<//review>< Response>

< review>
I won't be wasting my money on this company again. I have ordered two different arrangements from them, neither experience was good.
My first order from 1800 Flowers was for my grandparents 68 wedding anniversary. The flowers came in a box, which is standard for most orders. But about half the flowers were either broken, or wilted, yet they claim to have fresh flowers....
My second (and final) encounter with 1800 flowers was about a week ago. I ordered an arrangement for my sisters birthday to be delivered on Monday. I got a confirmation email say they had been delivered, but when I called her later that night, they had never arrived. I emailed customer service and they said they would "redeliver" them on Tuesday. Again I got a delivery confirmation email, but again when I called her, they were never delivered. I thought maybe they would show up on Wednesday (2 days late) but they never did. So this time I called Customer Service. I was on hold for about an hour through out the call, which was a little frustrating to begin with. Then when I told the woman the whole story, she said "Ok so whats the problem?" Baffled, I responded that the flowers I had ordered for the begging of this week has still not been delivered. It seemed as though she didn't care and wasn't going to do anything about it so I said forget it, I just want my money back at this point. A week has gone by and still no refund. BUT I ordered flowers from a local florist and the flowers were on her front porch HOURS after I ordered them!! If you want quality flowers, on time, ORDER LOCAL!< /review>

Wish I had seen the reviews before placing my order. Once again they did not get delivered. Rep on phone acted as if it was not a big deal that they can just be delivered the next day. Totally messing up my wife's anniversary. If you really don't want the flowers to show up place your order here you won't be disappointed.< /Review>

Absolutely the worst service. Ordered flowers early Thursday morning to be delivered Friday morning to my sisters school for Teachers Appreciation Week. It was 3:30 pm after school hours and they still didn’t deliver my sisters flowers. Had to re-route the flowers to her home which will get delivered at 9PM. Absolutely horrible, horrible company.< /Text>

I usually don't write reviews but this was one of the worst experiences I have had.  The order went through easily.  However the flowers were not delivered on day requested.  No Call or anything.  I called and talked to someone for 30 minutes and she promised to give her a chance to see if they could deliver it that day.  She never called back. I called again two later and the new person didn't have any idea what I was talking about.  She looked it up and told me that it has not yet been delivered but she will refund me my shipping costs.  I told her to cancel the order and she said that since it's been delivered she can't.  i told her few minutes ago she had told me that it had not been delivered (which is the case).  Finally after another 30 minutes, she agreed to refund my money and cancel the order.  I am still waiting for confirmation.  NEVER ORDER from this site.<//Text>

For once I was early, ordering flowers for Mother's Day 2 weeks early & asking for delivery on Friday before Mother's Day. Received order confirmation on 4/22 & Fed Ex confirmation on Friday that order had been picked up. Friday — no flowers delivered. Saturday — still no flowers. Mother's Day — 1-800- Flowers says they're late because they're busy. Really? Busy on Mother's Day? What a surprise! "If it absolutely, positively has to be there on time," don't bother to call 1-800-Flowers unless you want dead flowers delivered late. Did they offer a refund? No. They offered to call my wife & apologize. Just what she wanted. A lame apology from a call center in India. Next time I'll call a local florist.< /Text>

If I could put a 0 I would.  This company shouldn't even be in business.  I ordered an arrangement to be delivered Saturday... they couldn't deliver Saturday so then I was reassured it would be delivered Sunday for Father's day, i called in 3 times and never got a response from anyone and my order never got delivered.  This is by far the absolute WORST service I have ever received.</Review>

<review>I wish I could give them negative stars. Pre order for a before noon delivery, the delivery day at noon came and went with only a notification that 'order received by our shop'.  I got on chat help after noon time delivery was not received.  They were so not helpful!  Not addressing my concerns, but assuring me that the delivery will be made before 4pm.  Ludicrous! I just can't tell you how disappointing this situation is. This is a human nature kind of service and now I'm stuck picking up the pieces because I was depending on a service that could not fulfill it's order/promise.  The real downfall is I have used them several times in the past and even bought some 'passport' special program thing from them.  How do I get refunded for that? I'm sure it will be more hours on the phone, email and chat fighting for it.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<user>108351647098825158833<//user><Text>This has been the worst experience we've ever had with flower deliveries and totally unacceptable arrangements.  Flowers arrived with brown spots, broken flowers/leaves, missing flowers.  Have two deliveries, second slightly better than the first, but neither are a dream come true.  The 100% smile guarantee is totally false advertisement.  Don't order.  They won't even tell you where they are coming from.

NIGHTMARE - Please do not use this company, after 8 phone calls, flowers not delivered, an incomplete order, then a wrong delivery of wilted flowers that’s  still not corrected and this was this was a very expensive order of 4 dozen red roses ... go elsewhere and save yourself a major headache. I’d  give zero stars if I could!!</text>

Unhappy Birthday! I ordered a basket for a friend birthday and the basket contained wine. After waiting for 2 weeks they delivered the wine before the basket and did not include the birthday card with the gift..... What!? How is the person supposed to know who it is from?

Husband spent almost 80 dollars for an arrangement.  Received a basket with  about $5 of filler flowers.  Called florist who delivered advise they received 25 from the money paid to 1800Flowers and thats the best they could do. Lesson learned call the local florist and get what you pay for.  What a rip off 1-800-flowers is.<//Text>

<Review>Paid for same day delivery. Two days later I am informed the florist they are working with is not accepting 1-800-flowers order. The bouquet was “I am sorry Flowers” Horrified and embarrassed. Never again.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Terrible customer service. Could not get a refund for flowers that had not been delivered. Told me to call tomorrow for a full refund but only offered 50% off and $20 for my next order. Their website was terrible for tracking. I will never use this website again.<//Text>

BY FAR THE WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD ORDERING FLOWERS, IF YOUR  NOT LOOKING TO GET SCAMED OR HAVE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!! THEY OVER CHARGED ME, AND THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ME A RECEIPT, LUCKILY I TOOK A SCREEN SHOT FOR SUBSTANTIATION. THERE REPRESENTATIVES ARE TERRIBLE, I SPOKE TO TWO OF THEM ALREADY, AND BOTH OF THEM CAN BARELY SPEAK ENGLISH. THEY HAVE POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS BECAUSE OF IT. THEY FIRST EMAILED ME TELLING ME THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO DELIVERY MY ORDER ON THE DAY THEY SAID THEY WOULD DELIVERY IT. I HAD TO EMAIL BACK AND FORTH TO DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES THAT TRIED TO FIX THE DELIVERY DATE BACK TO THE INTIAL DELIVERY. WHILE TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK, THE REPRESENTATIVES NEVER GOT A HOLD OF THE BILLING DEPARTMENT. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS WEBSITE AGAIN!!!!!! BY FAR THE WORST EXPERIENCE!!!!</Text>

<Review>It wont let me leave NO STARS. Lucky you guys
My fiancé order myself the Valentines day dozen of roses with the heart vase and chocolates.... he paid for GUARANTEED delivery on Valentines day. THEY NEVER SHOWED! When I called customer service the lady said, they didnt have anymore of the ones he ordered.... so does that mean they sold him something that was NOT IN STOCK. On his order, it still doesn't even say its out for delivery. He ordered on the 8th. Will never order from them, and ill make sure my fiancé never does as well! Thanks for ruining my Valentines day, it could have been so much more and would have made my fiancé feel great.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>FRAUD. Weeks have passed and no sign of my son’s birthday present. Status has said ready to ship for two weeks now. Received a message from some random company today asking me to verify my purchase. I’ve never heard of them. Go kart USA is running a scam. They do not answer he phone or return calls. They only text. Suspicious. What business doesn’t take phone calls? Meanwhile, my son’s birthday has come and gone and he is devastated. Do not do business with this “company”. I wish I would have checked reviews first. I will be doing everything in my power to shut them down.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The worst customer experience I have had in a long time.  I sent an email on August 20, 2020.  I asked them about a part for a specific Go Kart that they still advertise as being sold on their web site.  I did not hear back but waited two weeks given we are in a global pandemic.  I then sent in in a follow up email. No response.  Next step was a phone call on 10/20/2020.  That went nowhere fast.  I figured I would give chat a try.  The virtual assistant kept trying to sell me products and interrupting the actual conversation with a LIVE chat agent.  The agent then says.  Maybe you should Google it.  Well... that's how I ended up on their site.   Its to bad that these guys couldnt get it together.  I needed one part but wanted to see how they provided service before I ordered my son a new Roadrat Kart.  Could have had a $2,500.00 sale by simply providing reasonable levels of customer service.<//text>

Beware!!!

I worked hard to give them my business, they worked hard to get this one star... refused to let me speak to a sales person... i am convinced that only a few people work here and they just list every go cart made.  Not really a business... just a drop shipper.

Anyone that won't spend 5 minutes answering a few questions to sell 2 go carts... well enough said...</Text>

I’d give it no stars if I could. I purchased a trail master go kart and had it assembled 5 days ago. Somethings wrong with the carburetor or gas line and Ive tried to email for assistance 3 times and haven’t heard Back at all. Horrible customer service. I took a chance because a lot of places were sold out and this place was one of the few places that wasn’t and I see why. Terrible service and response time. My 7 year old daughter couldn’t have a party for her birthday so we decided to get this for because she’s been asking and this is what happens. Go kart starts then stalls out after a minute or so of driving it. Hopefully I’m wrong and this company does care about customer service and reaches out to me to help fix this problem. My suggestion as of now is don’t do it</text>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!! I ordered a part (by part number) that is show in the diagram on GoKarts USA's website. It is clearly depicted what part I'm requesting in my order, because the diagram has a number and a line pointing directly at the part I requested. I received the wrong part, and was initially told that I would receive the correct part (via chat support) I opened a service request/case/ticket with them over a month ago, almost two months now. They keep closing the request, but don't send me any information on the resolution, or what I can do to receive the correct part. I have explicitly asked what I need to do to get the correct part shipped to me, with no response from GoKarts USA.  I've been going back and forth with their chat support and opening  follow-up requests (contacted them at least 8 times already), AND JUST KEEP GETTING THE RUN-AROUND, IT APPEARS THEY HAVE NO INTENTION ON REFUNDING ME AND/OR SHIPPING ME THE CORRECT PART, EVEN IF I EAT THE COST
AND THROW AWAY MORE MONEY WITH THEM (which of course, goes without saying, but I would never buy anything from this company again!!!). Don't know if I can go back and add to my review after I click submit, but I have pictures, emails, and chat transcripts to back-up my claim, If possible, I would give this company 0 stars, or actually  negative (-)10 stars.< /review>

Awful company. Ordered an "in stock" mini bike 3 weeks ago, still isn't here. Customer service is virtually non-existent. You can't call and talk to anyone, only e-mail and if they answer that, you're lucky. I received some parts after 18 days but still waiting on more. Taiwan and China parts, bikes and karts. I was hoping for better and was excited about the purchase but GoKarts USA ruined it.</review>

<Name>Bryan Wilson< /Name><Text>Stay away from this company. They sell low quality items at a high price. When you try to leave a negative review on the product page on their website, you’re told that the review will be posted after GoKarts USA approves it. Of course the negative review I left never got approved. Nice to know they deceive their customers by only allowing 4 and 5 star reviews to be seen on their website. Wouldn’t be surprised if those are also fake.< /Text><user>113625105299508248711</user><pictures>None< /pictures><time>1590449403754< /time><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I placed an order on July 9th.  They charged my card the full $1200 the next day.  According to their website and customer service recorded phone line, the average delivery time is 5-7 days.  It does state on the homepage of the site that they are experiencing delays due to high demand.  This is completely understandable so I waited 2 weeks (double the normal delivery time) for them to ship my order.  Still nothing.  I tried emailing, texting, live chatting and calling and could not reach a human.  The emails and texts don't receive a response, the live chat is automated, highlights key words from your messages and replies with generic answers that may or may not apply to your questions. The phone number is even more of a joke.  It's also automated and sends you in circles.  I also went on to their site to request a callback 4 days ago.  Still nothing.  I get the production and shipment delays during COVID but an update and a reply is expected.  I can't even cancel my order because their systems are a joke.  Now I have to dispute it on my credit card. I'd say they have the worst customer service but they don't have any service at all.< /Review>

<Text>07-24-20: We've now had the Trailmaster Mid XRX assembled for a week.  Assembly was pretty self evident for an experienced mechanic or karter, but that is good because printed instructions for actual assembly are practically non-existent.  You can find videos for assembly on YouTube, though.  The first issue, which I consider to be a safety issue, was that the seat belt/harness system would not operate correctly.  One of my grandsons was stuck in the kart for 15 minutes before actually trying to drive it, while I tried to lubricate, and eventually pry the catch mechanism apart inside the belt.  In addition, it is extremely difficult to tighten the belts, thereby resulting in 12 year old boys not bothering to get them tightened correctly.  Finally, after the first 10-15 minutes of running, the engine began to sputter, then died and could not be restarted immediately.  It was as if it had run out of fuel.  So, my grandsons patiently waited about 15 minutes while I checked over the fuel system.  The supplied fuel filter is opaque, so it was very difficult to see if there was any fuel flowing.  After checking things over, we tried to start it again and it fired right up.  The boys rode it for another 10-15 minutes at which time it again began to sputter and died, just as it did the first time.  This time I examined the fuel filter more closely and determined that it had indeed starved itself of fuel.  I contacted Tech Support and two days later received a reply that the carburetor was probably dirty and the jets clogged.  In my over 40 years of being a mechanical engineer, kart racing and 20 years of restoring classic motorcycles, I have never had a dirty carburetor be the reason for an engine running fine for 10 minutes, then sputter and die, only to be fine again 15 minutes later.  Nevertheless, I tore down the carb, but while having it apart inspected the fuel line and petcock on the gas tank.  From my experience, they appeared to be very small, allowing only a trickle of gasoline.  But, I reassembled everything and once again it ran fine for 10 minutes then sputtered and died until we let it rest for 15 minutes whereupon it ran fine again for 10 minutes.  After contacting Tech Support again, two days later I received a reply that stated, "must be a bad jet".  This time I bought a new petcock and a clear fuel filter correctly sized for a 6.5 HP engine, and replaced all the undersized fuel line with 1/4" fuel line.  It's been running fine since and wearing out my grandsons.  No more short, 10 minutes on, 15 minutes off.  I had been planning on buying two more of these for my other grandson's families, but will reconsider another company.< /Text>< Resp>

Go somewhere else.

Now they are still holding my money and reporting on every review site my reviews are fraudulent, and I am a representative of a competitor. I am a consumer who purchased the go kart for my daughters for Christmas. I am in no way affiliated with competitors. They have done this to my reviews on yelp as well as with the BBB.  I am sure they will do it to all my reviews eventually. I provided an invoice to the BBB. Hopefully that will do the trick.

I can assure you I have placed an actual order. They charged my card and have yet to refund it. I can provide an invoice and order number. I would contact the company directly, but my phone numbers and email addresses have been blocked by the company.< /review><UserId.>112525994185402627197<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

100% do not buy anything from Gocartsusa and ARf trucking. They are the worst customer support and failed notification for shipping. There delivery time. there tracking stated May 18th. But it was in storage at ARf May 5 and sat there with my following written delivery after 11am Monday through Friday  and verbal instruction to contact me. I get a letter May 12 stating Gocarts usa had them ship it back without a voice mail or text or email. before shipping back.. Gocarts charged me $510 to return a shipment that never was delivered. I have a pending Wells Fargo credit card complaint against this company. Not once did a human being ever call to talk to me after submitting physical documentation as evidence for both companies irresponsible actions. Technically they stole my private property and transported with out notice or contact. Which is basically grand theft and federal crossing state boundaries when unit was fully paid for even when partially refunded.. Get this the ARf trucking stated they do not have the ability to text. Seriously how the hell to your drivers ---communicate with drivers by pigeon. Go carts sent an email after return.< /Review>

This company is a joke.  Their customer service is non-existent. They also have a ridiculous shipping policy.  I live less than 10 miles from their locations. Won't allow pick up. Wants me to pay a $160+ for shipping. I can order their products elsewhere for cheaper.<//Text>

< Review>
TLDR: I ordered and they assured me I would receive a Fire Engine Red Mini Jeep, they sent out an Army Maroon Mini Jeep. I have emails to back up all the information contained within this review and GoKarts USA refuses to work with me to find a mutually agreeable resolution.

I really didn't want to leave this update, I wanted to work things out with GoKartsUSA but they have not provided any resolution to the matter through any of their support channels. I want to caution all future customers; I wish I had spent more time researching the reputation of this company before placing an order.

Here's the timeline:
7/27/2019 Order placed & model/color on Backorder
1/15/2020 Model/color back in stock
1/31/2020 Shipment received (but wrong model/color) - Email sent to GoKarts USA
2/3/2020 Called GoKarts USA - created support ticket and called GoKartsUSA as directed Nick (company owner?) unwilling to help, Summer unable to help. Email sent to sales representative Mario unable to help.
2/4/2020 Called GoKarts USA - Abe promised ticket update by 12PM on 2/5/2020
2/7/2020 Support ticket updated requesting current status.
Review left 2/12/2020

I want it to be clear, many emails and phone calls were exchanged with GoKartsUSA when I first ordered so that I would know exactly what they were going to send me and I would receive exactly what I wanted. Despite them delivering the wrong item, they are refusing to do right by the promises they made and failed to uphold.</Review>

Do not make the mistake i did. These reviews are accurate. I took a 1.5 hour drive (one way totaling 3 hours!) to personally take these guys my cart. When I got there they didn't even bother to take my cart off the truck for measuring (red flag).

If i could I would give less than one star rating. The sales rep sold me a bunch of nonsense and i took their work on it as they are the "experts".

Our shipment arrived incomplete. I am being charged a restocking fee and shipping for an item I never even received.

The business model here is say nothing useful, get you the wrong item and charge you to return it.

"...Original shipping and handling charges are not refundable and a 20% Restocking charge and/or 6% Cancellation fee..." -Return Rep.

Take your business somewhere else. You will be glad you did.<//review>

This is the worst experience I have ever had dealing with a company.  Anyone considering doing business with this place needs to find an alternative.  You will be sorely disappointed.

I was shipped the wrong part that took about 2 weeks to come in.  Not a huge deal.  I contacted customer service and was told it was a mistake from the supplier and they would have another one out ASAP.   2 weeks go by and no part.  I call and was told I need to ship the old one back on my dime before they could send the correct one out.   I was never told to ship the wrong part back and there was no way I was going to out of my pocket.  A manager finally got me a shipping label.  I went to return it the next day at fedex and was told they canceled the label.  I call back upset and was then told I needed to provide them a vin number so they could confirm my part.  Again something I was never asked for and I was only calling back to get a label.  I finally got a working label and sent it in the mail.   A week goes by and I get a refund for less than half of my total.  I call up livid this time.  I’m now told they need to check with shipping to make sure it’s the right part before they can refund me.  I explain you already refunded me part of it.  Well we need to make sure you sent back the correct part.  I explain it’s the part they sent me and no it’s not the correct part which is why we are having this conversation.  I was told there was a process they had to follow and they couldn’t refund me.  I am now going to have to go through PayPal to get my money back.  Frustrating doesn’t even begin to describe this place.  And with all the one star ratings I should have known better.<//review>

Do not buy from these guys.  I purchased $2000 worth of product from them recently (while trying to support small business).  They took my money, sent me only small portion of my order and now I can’t get them to respond to email, text, etc to find out the status of the rest of my order.  I’m starting to think this is a scam or these guys shut their doors and left customers in the lurch.<//text>

It must be me? I live in Florida, I have ordered hundreds of dollars of Merchandise, dozens of orders from Go Carts USA.
I had one order with a missing part, called about it, was met with a very nice person on the phone,  they put the new part in the mail, I received it and was taken care of.
But...I have a good attitude when I approach people and don't expect retailers to solve all of my life problems. Remember...these are toys not child care for a baby, put things in perspective.
For the people that "drove" 3 hours to take their cart there or claim that this is a drug front....Judas priest you might want to look at your own life first and see were the problem is. Ya think?< /review>

<text>**Stay far away from this company** The money back guarantee is total BS. They dropped shipped a buggy for my son as a Christmas present. My son drove it 3 times. Clutch was shot, electrical system fried, and the headlights burned out in 3 rides.  Called multiple times and the customer service rep says the mechanic saw nothing wrong with the buggy. So the clutch knocking, slipping, and throwing chains is perfectly normal. Headlights, horn, and push button start not working after three drives is normal also. Then it took 2 and a half months to attempt to collect my refund. Many calls with them saying the refund check was sent. Never showed up. Then after telling me on the phone it was being issued they send half of the money. Plus when pressed about why the refund he said was being issued was never sent, the customer service rep hung up on me. Very professional. You will not get a full refund from this company. Stay away.<//text>< pics>

Paid almost $2000 for a go kart  - had it professionally assembled.  Within 3 uses it will not turn left, seat belt will not latch, flag few off.  Called customer service - was told I had to submit the problems on-line with pictures before they would assist me.  Did so - been over a week and still can't get someone to help me.  I ordered the TrailMaster Blazer 200R  - very poor quality.  Horrible customer service.</Review>

Absolutely the worst place to buy GoKart parts from, I ordered two gokart parts for my Trailmaster 150xrx two weeks ago and they did not ship it until I had to personally called them and asked them to let me know when it will ship, then they proceeded to ship the same day just after i called them. Not only that but when the parts arrived one of them was not drilled correctly and I had to do it myself, Never ordering anything from here again.< /text>

Has anyone considered going in together to take this company to court? They sold a gokart to me that in the photos had pictures of the model with reverse and a vague discription of the Kart. To make things worse my daughter had a small accident and the seat belts locked. She was freaking out and it took 7.5 minutes to get her out (Yes exact time I have it on my security cameras only way to get her out was to get my tools and take the seat belt mounts out) This company sells misleading and dangerous products.<//Text>

Possibly the worst experience I've ever had with a retailer.  I had several issues with my order, stemming from parts that were never shipped, to items in the kit that did not work without purchasing additional parts myself to complete the project.  You get locked into their Terms of Service agreement when you purchase so Good Luck getting something fixed if you dare have an issue after 21-days.  If you're building a kit they will ship you items that do not all work together.  You will then deal with inconceivable arrogance and likely will not get your issue resolved.<//text>

Not even 1 our later i had my daughter riding it only to have the left rear wheel fall off. I had my wife pick me up in the truck took it home and noticed that the opposite side bolts for the wheel to the axle where also loose. I started checking the rest of the trike and found the seat whick requires four bolts only had three. I called and spoke with Miles to express my frustration and Niles replied what do you want me to do about it?" Never did he show any remorse or offer anything to correct my situation. I have decided to fix the problem my self by having to purcahse all new bolts and having to retap and thread both axles and purchase another bolt for the seat. This company is ran by three young men in the office that have no customer service what so ever. When i showed up no one ever greeted me they just sent me to the back to find some guy back there to show me the trike. Horrible business<//text>< Pictures>

They have incorrect information on their site and expect you to pay for it when returning items that won't work based upon the information they provided.

<Time>1502342267775</Time><rate>5< /rate><Text>Please read this as it is not just a review but a review outlining how Go Karts USA handles customers.

My initial order was a spontanious one and I was quite excited, unfortunatly what I was excited about turned out to be a mistake on the website. I was quickly informed that my order was improperly priced on the website and I would not be able to complete the purchase for that amount. Well, once I was informed my next step was to read reviews to see what I was dealing with, quickly I realized there are some bad reviews out there and I responded to ALEX that I would like my money refunded and I did not want to complete the order. This was after hours so I dreaded the thought of the time it would take to get the refund posted but within about 15 min, AFTER BUSINESS HOURS, Alex responed and refunded my charge, then went ahead and offered a compromise to make up for the mistake, Alex also appoogized. Well if this was truely how they work then I said HELL YEAH, lets make the order and I accepted the offer and within about a week and a half I was cruising aroung in my cool go kart. And this thing is pretty damn awesome.

Now to take one step back, while the Kart was being assembled we noticed a part that was damaged, all I had to do was fill out a help ticket and wait 24hrs to be informed a new part was being sent out.

If you want a go Kart for a good price and a company that cares, then Go Karts USA is the company for you.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1513265121428, 'text': 'THANK YOU RICK, Most Happy Customers do Not submit reviews.

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Worst customer service ever. #1 Tech support has no idea what they are talking about, sent them a picture and they tried to tell me the part was on backwards when it clearly was not. Not to mention you don't even get to talk to a live person you have to send them an email. #2 one of the items that I bought (intake manifold) wasn't even close to lining up with the bore of the carb (part was incorrectly made) yet they still charged me a re-stocking fee and the customer service rep began getting mad at me on the phone. Not a surprise they have so many one star reviews. Go look on their website all the reviews are 5 star I have no idea how......wait yes I do I tried to post a 1 star review on their website and what a surprise the never posted it. Just google gokartsusa reviews and you can see the real truth about this company. I would like nothing more than to see this business go under.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1489017855190, 'text': 'Wow so sorry you feel this way we have top level technicians on our team per manufacturer distributor and retailer of power sports products'}</Response><gmapID>0x80856e98b108bf29:0xd99148119645fa70</gmapID></record>

{'time': 1468969990988, 'text': 'Hi Tyler, You saw a difference because we have recently added new LTL Shipping which is better than Free Shipping. It shows you the actual Price, Shipping and Handling charges so that you can see the actual numbers. Free Shipping lumps all these charges into the Price. This way, we can ship 1 to 10 units to you for one low price. When you compare the total price, you will see that GokartsUSA is always the lowest, Try it now! Alex'}</Response>

All the orders I've ever made with them result in an email that says: Canceled - Item Discontinued.

They are intentionally listing items that they no longer carry to game google and get you on their website. Total scam and waste of time.< /text>

Worst experience ever not only did I feel like I was being followed around the store the whole time the staff was rude and unhelpful! I highly recommend they review their outlet discount discription. I felt like they decided to modify it to their convenience all the other stores honored my triple a discount except this location. I will never shop here Again you totally lost a customer. I've been in customer service for a well known bank for almost 10 years and let me say I go above and beyond for my customers and their experiences. A piece of advise if you can not work with people or different ethnicities find a different career.< /Text>

<text>It's a factory outlet. You know the drill. Cheeper stuff when it fits and is in season.< /text>< Time>

<text>Horrible customer service, rude and incompetent. The employees were contradicting each other, and clearly didn't know the store policies.

Also, they ordered an item online for me because they didn't have the correct size, and found out they do not give store credit exchanges for online purchases.

Not worth shopping here<//text>< Name>

I love this place. Am working on a (very) slow renovation of an old Craftsman style house and this place is a great source for materials and inspiration. If you want original materials, this is the spot.  Fixtures cost more here than from one of the big boxes but less than those charged by those speciality "restoration" stores that try to sell you new stiff that's "inspired by vintage styles".<//review>

Some of my favorite purchases are: old wooden milk crates, vintage Pasadena street signs, glass door knobs, metal keys and a solid wood door that I will someday repurpose into a table.

The owners are super nice. If you purchase a lot and pay cash you can get a sweet bargain.< /Review>

<Review>We were flying out at 3:30, and received our sons passport at 1:00! Impossible to find an apoitment online? just come to a passport agency nearest to you without appointment, if you have valid reasons for this express service, and come very early, they will help you. We came to LA agency at 5 am, and there were already 6 people in line! (Agency in Tuscon, AZ doesn't have such long lines, from what I hear) But this was a line for people with appointment. So when it opened at 7am, we were moved to a different line. To get an appointment, get in line to the windows with WILL CALL sign.! So when our turn came, they asked us why we need the express passport, we showed tickets for the same day and got an appointment rights away ( this took less then 5 min), but needed to get through the other line which moved pretty quickly, and at 10:00 we were already out with receipt to get out passport at 1pm. We paid $175 for a child's passport, exactly the amount you find online, I don't know why the other reviewers paid 400$, maybe adult passports are that much more expensive. The security guard outside was very nice, but strict, and gave out lots of good advice to everybody.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bb7d714a4885:0x37594b4563f90cf1<//gmap_id>< Date>

I am not a big reviewer, but I want to take a moment to compliment their service. The passport application for my daughter was still in progress after submission 4 weeks ago and the flight was next business day. It was impossible to get a hold of customer service by the phone (put me on hold more than 2 hours), and the online appointments were immediately full after every midnight. So I decided to drive 500 miles to the LA office to see if there is any solution.

It turned out that they do not accept walk-ins, so do not expect to be accepted without appointments. However, the manager came outside the building and helped people outside make appointments for next business day. In my case, they couldn't get access to my application because they found out mine was held up in the east coast. However, the manager kindly emailed the Charleston office and explained my urgency. A few hours later, the passport was mailed and arrived home next morning!

One more thing, I know it is really frustrating to see things don't work as you planned/wished but please be nice to them. They are good people and willing to help you with what they can. Some people are just so rude.<//review>

<Review>I’ve been trying to find an appointment for over 2 weeks now, refreshing constantly and have yet to find any. One day I️ even Refreshed every 5-15 minutes from 9pm -5am (not even exaggerating) just to see if maybe I️ was Just trying at the wrong time, but nope. I️ even Checked other states and found nothing. Idgi, if covid is getting better and LA is in the yellow phase, how come there’s no change in capacity here?<//Review>< name>

Clean, run well, security, places to eat within walking distance, and I get my passport by the next day of not that day.< /Review>< time>

It's best to go early during the week,  like 8am, to avoid the lines. You can get a rush 'expedited' passport if you need it. Normally, the wait time for a US Passport is about 8 weeks, so if you have a medical type emergency and have proof of travel, such as s plane ticket, they may allow you to get your passport in days, not weeks. I found the staff very efficient and friendly.< /Text>

After submitting my passport paperwork to a local post office (as the acceptance agent), everything went missing (go figure, it's the Postal Service). With travel plans fast approaching, I made an appointment with the L.A. Passport Agency, explained everything that happened at the Post Office (with the documentation), and got my Passport in time for my trip. Bottom line, the staff at this Agency were willing to listen to my dilemma, review the documentation I turned over, and do the right thing. Everyone I talked with was professional and understanding, while still presenting what options we had (within the rules of the Agency) in a respectful manner.</text>

Our clients are artists, Entertainers, Athletes and have urgent matters for work. We are very lucky to have this office to issue same day passports and help with emergencies. Nigerians have to wait 8 weeks for a new passport.</Text>

<Review>Passport expired. I needed a passport asap since my flight was on the same day in the afternoon. And wow, it was done in less than 3 hours. Staff was incredibly friendly. And the cost was absolutely reasonable for my dumb mistake. Just make sure u have an appointment and all ur docs ready to go.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

I think your experience at this agency all depends on when you come and how desperate you are.  If you come the same day as your flight, you are amazed that you can get a passport the same day.  If you come two weeks before your flight with an Appt., but you still have to stand for over an hour in the cold outside (In Feb, or heat in July), and then you have to come back and have over an hour wait at the pickup window (which may have had less than 10 people the day you came to wait in the application line, while that line suddenly has no wait), then you don’t see it as very efficient.  Regardless, come early, dress warmly (or have layers to lose), bring an umbrella and something to do.  There may be no line for your purpose that day...or you may spend over 3 hrs handling something you paid a premium for...just be prepared- no rhyme or reason. It ebbs and flows.<//Text>

I came on a Saturday Passport Day. Incredibly efficient service. The staff was very good at their jobs. I will say when you increase efficiency you lose a bit of customer service as the staff could be considered rude. But I was out of the office very quickly. I was surprised by the way they handled such a high influx of people. The staff seemed prepared and not even slightly overwhelmed.< /text>

Cant put my fingers on it how to rate it.
It's great that we are able to get our passport on time to travel.  So that part it is top 5 stars.

One of thing I had encounter today was taking passport photo again.  I never had issue with passport photo before.  For last over 15 years or so all our family been taking passport phone at this one place close to our home and we never got held up at airport for not looking like same person.

But 7am in the morning, agent tells us we do not look like our photo so we were told to retake it.  We will be held up for questioning at the airport if we don't re do it because we don't look like our photo.  Of course we don't look like that..... how could anyone look all dolled up at that hour.
But what do you do when you need that passport to travel outside US...... of course we re took it.  Thankfully we had cash on us ...... as who carries around cash these days...... and they ONLY take cash.

We are still thankful that we are able to get passport on time for our travel but .... now I am thinking did we really needed to re take photo.  Photos taken at the studio is of course so much better looking than snap shot *bit better than your DMV photo*.  Anyone look better than their DMV driver license photo.  I haven't yet met anyone who loves to show around their DMV photo.

And why accept only cash??????

Why do they have ONLY CASH photo booth?????  It's federal building so I am sure you know.......but still

yeah, we are not happy we had to spend more money to get photo taken.
AGAIN.  mind you, of course we had to get our passport photo done with "right out of bed look" as we had to leave our place by 6am to get there by 7am.   We all have our looks in the morning and I for sure had that look that morning.  Not happy about having that phone for next 10 years< /Review>

Applied for my passport over a month ago paid for expedited services and have not received it. For some reason it was sent out to Portsmouth location and after several failed attempts to acquire information on my passport, made an appointment to this location on Wilshire Blvd and they were able to resolve my problem almost immediately.

Thanks for letting me make an appointment on a day where your entire office was closed. Other people who came on the same day as me were crying because they needed to fly out that same day but couldn’t because your agency screwed up. You guys are incompetent. You’re in a position where you really shouldn’t be<//review>

Free parking. Fellow passport getters are usually attractive and will tolerate a chat as there ain't nothing else going on. The later your appointment is the sooner you will be getting the hell outta there. And if you have lost every picture ID you've ever had bring your High School Yearbook. Thank god I did.<//review>

<Review>This is handled much like other government buildings, so prepare for lines and waiting. However, the waiting is very controlled, with helpful staff walking around providing useful information. The guards are also helpful, sharing directions and ensuring you're safe. The line can get long, so do your best to get an appointment. Pro tip - fill out all your paperwork before you show, bring some reading or a mobile device, and be patient.</Review>< name>

Good Customer service free parking my recommendation get all the passport form ready , Photos,birth
,certificate,Citizenshit diploma,Travel confirmation and you won’t have any delay with the passport process.
Thanks to one young Chicano Consulate Agent  was very helpful with the passport process Window 17
Take extra time to be on time with you appointment you will need like 1-1 1/2 to get in to the building and after that only 1 hour if you get all the documents ready .
Book passport /Passport card $ 210.00
03/21/2019
You will get the same day o 3 days you need to coming back to get it you need to go will call window out side the Building.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I had such a fantastic experience getting my passport renewed here!  The agent (Marie) who helped me was so friendly and when she said to come back in two days to pick up my passport, I was in shock that it had been so quick and painless.  $170 total to expedite the process.  If you're going to do the mail-in option and wait for it to come back, you might as well make an appointment and do it here to make sure you get it faster.

Get here at least half an hour early because the line for check-in can be quite long.  Make sure you have your appointment confirmation number to enter.  They will require a print-out your flight itinerary, your old passport, and new photos.  They have forms in the office although they take a while to fill out so it's best you have them ready to go, too.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Wait outside 10 minutes
Went to 7th floor got photo taken 4 minutes
Wait to get into waiting room 5 minytes
Wait to get my number 15 minutes
Wait for my number to be called 30 minutes
Wait for passport 5 hours.

Must have Id, birth certificate and proof of travel.</Text><UserId.>101122439155632539267< /UserId.><Date>1553714146883< /Date>< Rate>

I needed expedited service as I needed to fly on the same day as I applied for a new passport. I was not able to make an online appointment due to bank holiday and walked in with a filled out application. The staff was very friendly and treated me with great respect. I did not wait for 2 minutes to hand in my application. In order to prove expedite service I showed my flight itinerary at the counter and in 2 hours I had my complete passport ready. I made it in time to the Airport and was able to fly on the same day thanks to the wonderful service and staff. Thank you very much. YOur help was very much appreciated!</Text>

I needed my passport quickly. I flew into LAX and went to my appointment at passport agency. Each person I dealt with from the info desk to the person that handed me my passport was helpful and friendly. I walked out with a passport in 3 hours. I was expecting the typical government (aka dmv) office and was pleasantly surprised.</Review>

I can’t even tell you how thankful I am for this office.  Even open during a government shutdown!  And on New Years Eve! Even if you have an appointment, get there early.  Have all your paperwork in order.  They processed my passport by 7:10am and I had it in hand by 10:00am.  I caught a flight at 12:05pm to Cabo!  Seriously can’t thank the federal government enough for my mistake!  Renew your passport on time to avoid having to do this, but if you must get a passport in one day... it’s possible!!< /text>

<rating>1</rating><text>We really had our hopes up on receiving a passport in time to make our flight. We made the huge mistake of not realizing my passport had expired. After reading the reviews and following instructions from others we hoped it would work in time.
Check in was excellent and everyone was very helpful. They said they hoped to have it completed by 11am. We showed up and it was not given to us until after 1:30pm. Missed our flight and had to pay a huge price to get new tickets.
The frustrating part was that they had another person's passport ready by 11:30am. After asking several times, and being told to check back in an hour, we finally called the number on the receipt and were told it was ready. When I went to the window and told them what I was told on the phone it was "suddenly" ready. Very frustrating since it seems like it had been ready the whole time and it could have saved us quite a lot of money and stress.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Claudia one of the specialist made it easier I appreciate her help and the other lady.  Yes we got here around 11 am got our ticket waited got seen but it took 9 hrs . If it helps take the flight reservation you have if it's an emergency flight or a letter it has to be translated if it's from a foreign city.</Review>

<text>If you call in for an appointment reservation. It does not matter. Passport booklet plus North American travel card is about 225-235. Have your birth certificate, or old passport booklet, passport photo ready.

Passport booklet is good for ten years. They offer an two options for a passport. One with like 25 pages or so and one w 100 pages. No price difference.

You can pick up your passport in one day w an extra fee. Also, you can have it expedited through mail w extra fee too.<//text><Rate>4</Rate><GmapID>0x80c2bb7d714a4885:0x37594b4563f90cf1</GmapID></record>

<review>It was a stress free experience Before going to this office I called the 800 number and the representative told me exactly what forms to fill and which documents to take with me.We had no appointments hence we were walk ins .We went to the At Will Windows and got a appointment promptly via phone as we were directed.The lines inside the passport office moved very quickly .And we were there for only 3 hours from beginning to the end for a 2 day expedited New Passport application.Very very quick service with a lot of Windows open to fasten the service.
Great experience.And best of all ample amounts of free parking.<//review><name>Romana Ghadiali Patel<//name>< Pics>

Aside from free parking there's not much nice I can say about this place.  Renew your passport by mail so you don't have to endure going to this place.  What was supposed to be a same day passport ended up being two days of standing outside in the hot sun.  Had to cancel three flight reservations due to their delays.< /Review>

<time>1415174977793<//time><Review>The wait is not Bad at all.first they will ask you if you have an appointment and your confirmation number so have it ready.    An appointment gets you in the building past security first of course( without an appointment there might be a slightly longer wait) but once inside everyone stands in the same line.

You will need all original or certified copies of your birth certificate. or you'll have to come back.

the whole process was about an hour and 15 minutes.
parking , security , the line where they check out all your documents to see if you have everything and then give you a number and then waiting for your number to be called.
Ha d a Tuesday appointment and will pick up my passports on Thursday.

by the way they keep your birth certificate until you pick up your passport they don't give it back to you immediately.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><userid>110021778484885420852< /userid><Response>None<//Response><Rate>4<//Rate>< gmapID>

I was helped over the phone by Carl and at the passport office by Matt. Both were extremely helpful and efficient. My trip would not have been possible without them. I also could not believe there was free parking at the federal building...in the middle of West L.A of all places. Many Thanks<//review>

They can give you passport next day when you need it, but either make an 7am appointment and arrive at least 20minutes before or come here latest 6:30in the morning, otherwise, expect 2hours waiting outside will call window plus 2 hours inside. And remember they close at 3pm. So either come early or come early next day</Text>

The PRO: You WILL get your passport the same day
The CON: It will take 9+ hours...everything is outside no lounge (sun, wind etc).

I showed up at 6 am (opens at 7 am) and there were 30 people in line. My flight was leaving the next day at 11 am. I was "low priority" and was processed to come back at  3pm once I handed in my filled out D form, pictures and the $170 fee at the window. The "high priority" were people leaving the same day. So you're likely to get your passport faster if your flight is the same day. The sooner the flight the highest priority and they are very good at parsing people out  from the line even before the office opens. Show up EARLY!< /Text>

<review>Great service!!

Our situation was different as my son had an application in process with a different passport agency but we were missing one document. I was very nervous as we are scheduled to depart in just 5 days and I had received the missing document yesterday. We live in Las Vegas and this was our nearest passport agency.

The passport agent who helped up was beyond helpful and reassured me that everything was going to work out. He stated that he will follow up with a phone call to confirm that the paperwork he sent to the agency was accepted.

The moment he heard from the agency he gave me a call to let me know they had accepted my paperwork and they will overnight my son's passport.

We did arrive early as we didn't have an appointment. We arrived at 5:30am and there were about 13 people ahead of us. Total time from entering the building was 37 minutes</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I sent them everything they asked for to get my passport and they said that was not enough.  They said they want more and I told them I can give them a handful of things of the list and they said it was not enough.  They are telling a American citizen who has never left the country and has no outstanding warrants or felonies, who's federal taxes are paid that I am not an American.  Their thugs! Anyone who takes your money and says thanks but I want more and you give them more and they say sorry not enough but we are keeping your money is a thug.<//review>

<Review>My appt was at 1230PM on a Monday and I started out in security line at 12PM. Waited approx 10-15 min. After security I walked to the passport agency inside where I gave my confirmation # info. Then I waited in line to get my docs checked (maybe 10 minutes). Armando (first person I met within passport office) is responsible for checking you have all your needed documents before giving you a calling number to finalise & confirm new passport with federal official. I had some mistakes & he gave me time, paper, pen, and advice on how to fill things out efficiently, despite there being a line behind me he was extremely warm and his help really made my day, he went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect.
Make SURE YOU BRING ALL YOUR NEEDED DOCUMENTS - CORRECT PASSPORT PIC - FLIGHT RESERVATIONS - ETC.. reading these reviews it seems a lot of people did not look at what they actually needed to prepare.
The federal official read through everything & I signed a form and paid - I was in and out in about an hour.
Passport ready 3 days after appt for a flight a week from appt. So much more efficient & less annoying staff than you'd expect at a government office, fab experience overall.
Note: there may be loud kids / babies so I would advise bringing some headphones to pass the time waiting. Additionally for passport pickup there is no seating area, it's a window outside the building, so for those who have difficulty standing for possibly a long amount of time bring a foldup chair 8-)<//Review>< Pictures>

All i can say is just Wow...Kudos to all the employees here :)

The guards were friendly and showed us where to go.

The lady at counter A (copy) was super nice.

The Asian lady behind the counter (Clerk #000416) was very detail and patient to get my application fixed (i made some mistakes) and she was friendly too.

PS: Follow your appointment time...don't come here too early cos you won't be in until your app time. Follow all the instruction, prepare all the original documents and make a copy including copy of front + back part of your ID, passport size photo and you'll be in and out within 1 - 1.5 hour. If you drive there's a free parking by the building and enter from Veteran Avenue.

Updated:
Picked up my passport today to be exact 5 days after i submitted. Everything went well less than 30 minutes in a line.</Text>

Horrible customer service went 3 times because every time the lady in the window kept saying she need it more documents she was super rude and amused by the whole situation and she had the nerve to say I've never seen you before like I've been here 3 times and all by you what do you mean?? ( skinny older lady, blue eyes, short blond hair with glasses )<//review>

So I got there at 6 a.m. and the staff there were very friendly. I showed them that I was traveling within 2 days so they processed my passport application process really fast. Also, they told me to come back at 3 to pick up my passport and when I came back they happily gave me my new passport in an envelope.< /review>

My appointment was at 1:00pm I arrived a bit early but after going through the security check, one of the security officers just asked for my confirmation number and appointment time and let me go to the window directly. The staff was very friendly and helped me through the process rather quickly. I had sat down for only 5 minutes when my ticket number was called. The lady at the window was very friendly and did my paperwork rather quickly. I was out by 1:15 pm. Being 17 I thought the process would take longer but it went fast and conveniently. It really erased that bad view I thought the staff was going to be!< /review>

I left my watch in the bin when going thru security at the Los Angeles Passport Office on Friday, 1/20/17 and when I called this morning to speak to someone to find out if the security guard turned in my watch I was told there is no one live to speak with at the Los Angeles Passport Office. I live 3 hours away so apparently I have to take time off from work and drive down in the HOPES that my watch was turned in. Really? Worst experience there ever. On top of dealing with the least helpful representatives there, I most likely have to kiss my watch goodbye.< /Text>

I came in thought I had to wait 2 weeks for my husband's expedited passport since I have one already & we had to leave soon, the process was so fast if i could rate more than 5 stars I would, everyone was literally so friendly especially in a government agency facility, even the security guards & the ones who checks the scanning of items for entrance, and the person who did my husbands passport application did it in like 5 mins, and it was ready to be picked up in 2 days ! Thank you so much !<//review>

Made an appointment for 7 AM, still had to wait outside the building for about 30 mins. Forgot my. Id so had to come home and get it. When i returned about an hour later, was told my passport photo wasn't valid. Even though at my FIRST appointment at 7:00, nobody said anything was wrong with my photo. Had to reschedule my appointment for Wednesday and now might not get my passport in time.< /Text>

<Review>AMAZING experience! i’m not just saying that either and i’ve never even made a review for any place! this agency DOES get packed but the people there are super efficient and organized so that everyone can be accommodated as much as possible. and additionally the employees have good attitudes for having so much work every single day. all the guards communicate and help direct people to the right place. i suggest if you’re coming here, to get here an hour before it opens to be processed through. got here at 630 am and came out before 830 am. bring all the correct paperwork and forms of ID and payment! total of 170$ or so at the end of the day. free parking as well! i hate government facilities especially the DMV & i thought it’d be as horrible and strenuous but it was the total opposite. i can’t stop gassing up this place! i recommend you show up early and bring proof of flight(s) so you will be moved up asap. -sam<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

<Time>1528928841377</Time><rating>1<//rating><text>Horrible experience. My niece and nephew needed passports to travel and they were denied bc my sisters passport was expired eventough she was not traveling with us. She just needed to show proof of I.D that she was their mom. On the website and other government web sources it clearly says a “us expired passport is a valid form of id”. The clerk and supervisor denied it anyway. We went back the next day and again the senior agent told us we needed a court order and receipt from dmv. We were traveling in 3 days and she said we had enough time to do all of that and return the next day.  We asked to speak to a supervisor and she clearly stated that if she got a supervisor to speak with us she will deny the kids application.  She was in the wrong and clearly was pulled front the window and sent home.  Do not allow them to be tyrants bc they want to be. Rules are rules and it applies to everyone and she was just having a bad day and wanted to ruin our travel plans. The supervisor was able to help process the applications and we were finished. But a what a horrible experience.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I have never had such a run-around in my 68 Years. I have been sent to Los Angeles, to Virginia, to Chicago, back to Los Angeles and I still can't get any help. I called my Senator and I hope she can do more than bounce me to another agency.</Text>

So it was super easy to make an appointment with an automated phone system, but only to stand and wait for one and a half hours outside. I don't know why they don't pace out appointments so the wait is not that long.  And some people came with no appointments (don't know why they are so surprised when they are told they need appointments?), and they are still told to get in line..... So what's the point of making an appointment?????  There should be separate lines for appointments and no appointments like DMV.  I didn't wanna bring too many things with me knowing I would have to go through a security check, but I sure needed water and a thick book. It's ok if your appointment is passed the time as long as you are in line. Once I was in, there were 3 windows open out of 20, and took another 20 min for the whole paperwork process.  All this time, all the employees were courteous and nice.</review>

This Passport office is seriously the model of government efficiency. The worst part was the line to get in the door and to the check-in. After that it took less than 15 minutes.
They should overhaul the DMV!< /Review>

If you are traveling the same day get here early and by early I mean 5:30 AM!!! Because I got here at 6:45 am on a Tuesday and there were like 60 people ahead of me. You don't have to have an appointment but they do serve the appointments first.
Have your stuff ready like citizenship certificate, itinerary, passport forms filled out, passport picture, check, or credit card. You will not need all of these at once but just be ready.
1. Free parking
2. Sit and wait till they open at 7am
3. An officer will come and ask who has an appointment an then you'll be in a separate line
If you don't have an appointment remain at the same line. I didn't so I waited to be call to the window outside.
4. When you get to the window you'll let the person know what is your situation. I was applying for a brand new passport and was traveling within four days so they gave me a cheap piece of paper that said walk-in and the date
5. Then you'll go to another line and wait to be checked by security. This took long like 45 min since they let the appointments go first!
6. When the officers call you they give you a gray bin so you put everything there.
7. Now you're inside the building and you have to wait again to get a ticket with a number like the DMV. You tell the agent your situation and they issue your number. The good thing is that they have 18 windows. For the most part like 12-14 were servicing people. But I noticed that around 9ish a lot of agents took s break and so there were only 4 windows open. My number came up really fast. The agent asked if this was the first time I applying for a passport and asked for my itinerary and then I paid and he gave me a receipt. He told me to come pick up my passport on Thursday after 2pm or Monday around 8.

Additional info:
There's a place in the same vicinity that takes passport pics but only accept cash!! There's also food if you get hungry but is pricy. If you're unable to pick up your passport then you may authorize someone else to pick it up for you just follow the instruction on the receipt.
Overall I had a great experience!</Review>

But dear lord this place was magical. Everyone was so nice and helpful. I felt like I was in Disneyland. I wish I new their names so I could compliment them here, but all of the employees were extremely friendly and really wanted to help me out.

I wasn't believing what I was seeing when I entered this office cuz when I go to the passport office in Iran, everyone hates each other and hate their jobs and hate the world around them, and you have to beg employees like crazy to help you out when ur facing a problem.

But these folks, wow, they were fantastic and very sociable and friendly individuals. Something I would never expect to see in a government institution. One of them was so awesome that I wish I had her number to ask her out Hahahah (kidding). I was in and out within 30 minutes, and it only took that long cuz I had't filled out my application in advance!<//Review>< Rate>

<rating>5</rating><Text>My experience was different from the other reviews. As suggested by other reviewer, I arrived early, about 7:05 and there was already a small line labeled "passport check in." An officer greeted me and informed me that I didn't need to be there until 15 minutes prior to my appt. time. However, I came back at 8am which was still an hour before my appt and and they let me in. Since I was traveling within 48 hours I could have qualified as a "mercy call" which means that I could have been seen immediately without an appt. but according to the officer that meant that my case would have been handled with the other "will call" cases and that would have delayed my passport pick up. With a 9am appt. my passport was ready at 1pm, whereas the people without appts won't didnt recieve their's's until between 3 and 5pm.< /Text>< pictures>

Inaccurate information on website and from customer service. This wasted 4 hours of my time.

The website should say get here from 7-8am for walk-ins. They will not allow you to get a same day appointment otherwise. Also, you have to call daily for appointments, because sometimes they open up.</text>

Ugh! So stupid, so apparently now you cant do walk ins unless you have a travel date or its an emergency. Last time i took someone who had no travel date, and was able to do walk in without appointment. Those people are just being to damn lazy.< /Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) From the passaporte agency and its eficasia I have nothing to say but this time I think they behaved a bit cruel understand that to do a process you need an appointment that I am clear but make a line of almost 45 min to let you know that you do not They will attend and give you a piece of paper so that you can make an appointment that if it is cruelty and more in this time of cold as an adult I have no problem but they should be more human and not pass the children through this experience. the offices are not adapted but the cruelty with which they treat you that I do not understand it I am paying for a service they are not doing it for free

(Original)
De La agencia de passaportes y su eficasia no tengo nada que decir pero esta vez creo que se portaron un poco crueles entiendo que para   hacer  un tramite  necesitas una cita eso me quedo claro pero hacer  una linea de casi 45 min para dejarte saber que no te van  atender y darte un papelito para que Hagas  una cita eso si seme hace crueldad y mas en este tiempo de frios como adulto no tengo   ningun problema pero deverian de ser mas humanos y no hacer pasar  a los niños por esta esperiencia creo ya de por si las oficcinas no estan adaptadas pero la crueldad con que te tartan eso no lo entiendo estoy  pagando por un servicio no lo estan haciendo gratis<//Review>

<Text>I have gone to Polka Dot Nail & Spa twice and both times have been very happy with my manicure and pedicure. I am not the type of customer who needs a fancy ambiance and high pricing. I want to get my nails done and be on my way without fuss and without the enormous price tag. If you are looking for a more high-end feel and price tag, this will probably end up disappointing you. However, for me, this is exactly what I was looking for.

The staff is friendly and pleasant and I would be happy to continue going back!< /Text>< Pictures>

LOOOOOOOOVVVVEEEEEE THIS PLACE! It's a great vibe, comfy, chic salon and the staff always aims to please. Everything from simple to intricate design seems effortless for them. If I can leave the salon I've been going to for the past 10 years for here, to me,  that's amazing! I'm always happy!< /review>

< Review>
Being from out of town I am not familiar with other places but chose this place based on the 1 other review. I am more than pleased. Had a mani/pedi and probably was the best I've ever gotten. Super friendly and super clean. They use new tools for each person. I'm going to have to make an extra effort to get back.<//Review>

Was disappointed because this nail salon came with high recommendations. The person that did my nails the first appt was constantly answering the phone and not concentrating on what they should be doing. I figured maybe it was because it was the busy holidays. Was questioned why I did find a nail salon closer to where I live. I explained they came with a high recommendation.  I went ahead and made an appt with the same person that did my nails. About a week after 3 nails popped off. Never in my life has that happened. Yes 1 here and there but not 3 at the same time. Showed up to my next appt only to he told they can't find my appt. How do you loose an appt? They gave me someone else and it was just ok. Didn't talk or get to know me. That night one nail broke off on the tip and couldn't get back to fix it. Needless to say I will never go back to Polka Dots. I feel it's  all about quantity and not quality.< /text>

<Text>First and last time. I was so excited to try out this place. I made an appointment and had to wait 30 more minutes. I needed to get my acrylics off and he grabbed a fake nail and took them off , I was expecting them to take it off with water ext. so my nails don’t get too damaged (I could of took them off at home with my nail clipper) It was painful and they still charged me. Andy did my nails partially, he was struggling to make them glittery and the guy next to him was giving him advice but he got frustrated and didn’t listen. So I said it was okay not to worry (went to CVS to buy glitter and add more 🙄) halfway through the process he stopped and went to do someone else nails and a lady took over and said put your hands in the UV light and than you can leave after. They were so rude and I was so happy to be there I felt like crying because worse of all  I let him know that I was going to get engaged soon and the effort he put to do my nails sucked! I left him a tip because I’m not going to let people effect my kindness maybe next time he can be nice to people and gossip less and worry more about his clients.</Text><Rate>1</Rate></record>

<Review>I wish I could give this place negitive stars. I went here because it was close and had 5 stars. I entered with natural nice nails and left with super thick, crooked, messy acrylics. There was gel in my cuticles, the nails are slanted and not the same size. My pointer is 5x bigger in one hand. I asked for a coffin nail, and only 8/10 of my make have that. It took two people to shape my nails! And they are still uneven. Also she did not file down my nails underneath and there are little bits poking me. I highly recommend not going her. This place sucks.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I stopped by with my sister and we got our nails done here... and they came out lovely... unfortunately, I had a little accident during our shopping trip. We called back the same day and Henry, who is one of the owners picked up, told us to not worry and he'll take care of us. Also the staff there are really friendly. Thank you so much!! :))< /review>

<text>Busy place but very disappointed in how long gel manicure lasts. Less than one week and it’s peeling off!  The other issue I have is that they are constantly trying to up sell you wvery 5 minutes during your visit, hard to relax when they are constantly badgering. For the price, not worth what you get</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>Best nail salon I've visited in the Thousand Oaks area. Clean, attractive decor, and well organized and run. I've had multiple mani/pedis from different techs and each has been excellent. You can pay by card but must tip cash.< /review><username>Denise Ellis Stewart< /username>< gmapID>

My usual nail salon is closed on Mondays and I needed a manicure for an event the next day, so I ended up at Polka Dot Nails after seeing a ton of great reviews online.
Service was friendly. The inside didn't have music blaring like some places and it was calming & quiet even though it was packed. The massage chair worked well and everything seemed clean and the color selection was good. I got a regular spa pedicure and a gel polish manicure.
The pedicure was good, no complaints. Basic and everything a spa pedicure usually entails.
The manicure cost less than my normal place that Only does gel which was fine, but now I know why- One of my nails (so, with GEL polish) Chipped after 2 days. (Gel polish is designed to Not do that.)
So, that's a bit frustrating. Plus, the UV gel dryers- both if then were having issues that day and I wonder if the polish didn't get to set correctly/thoroughly (?) there has to be a reason for the polish chipping because it's definitely not due to extensive wear & tear on my part. So that's my only real "complaint" - which is more so just a minor annoyance not a complaint. The experience as a whole and regarding the actual salon was not "bad" at all.
Cons: The parking lot is really tiny, and they ONLY take cash tips so I had to go across the street to find an ATM so I could tip. Granted, they took me as a walk -in and I didn't have to wait even though they were quite busy.
Pros: It's a good nail salon and I would go there again if the need arose, friendly & thorough service (no rushing to get me in & out or not doing a good job due to rushing)
...but even as I type this I'm looking at my chipped nail and feeling a little bit salty about it. I didn't spend $30 on a manicure to have it last 48 hours....<//text>

New ownership as of two weeks ago! Total improvement! The girls behind the counter are top notch with customer service and care with your order. I'm so pleased it's changed ownership. BIG-TIME "cultural" change - you won't be disappointed !</review>

I was excited that there was a bagel place near my work. The first couple times I went it was okay. But the last two times it was all bad. One trip I was so hungry I bit into my bagel and there was the longest black hair in between the cream cheese. I was so grossed out. The most recent time I went there is a young woman who is so rude. I actually refuse to go back because of her. She was belittling and her attitude sucked. I would rather take my business elsewhere.</text>

I wish there was more choices of small croissants, the bagel 🥯 is a smaller size than the average size. Otherwise is just another bagel store 🏪 I need to know some times is close early morning than where do I go for my morning treat.<//Review>

i spend probably 100.00 a week getting breakfast for me and my fiance from here and lately everytime we go the bagels are wrong, the bagels are burnt, the service is slow,  ive had to throw away bagels because all i can taste is burnt. there should be a standard of if you look at the bagel and its black  that you should probably make another one or get a new machine.
very dissatisfied and will never be going here again.< /text>

Hi taco Bell is always good for a quick bite. Love the chalupas.  I really don't like to say anymore any negative words like I have said for other places in the past. Especially now that most places are really working hard to keep open the restaurants and fast food places. Do to the Pandemic it's terrible for everyone. God bless America 🙏<//review>

<rate>2<//rate><review>Update: star knocked off for removal of my favorite menu items and those of other members of my family, such as the mexi melt, Mexican pizza, Caramel apple empenada, etc. A few of these are apperantly popular enough that there are still internet memes about them being gone that are meant to make the removal seem malicious, and they are spreading like wildfires.

This seems like mismanagement to me, as the items replacing these ones are clearly designed to be cheap to make at the expense of tasting like anything but a misuse of nacho style cheese sauce. That stuff belongs on nachos, not in burritos. Gross.</review>< pictures>

Awesome customer service,y order was wrong due to hearing wrong. I personally know how frustrating that is, since I wear hearing aids in both ears and still can't hear to well. Anywho they fixed it and let me keep the other it. Oh yeah they no longer have the other item I asked for rather.</Review>

Ordered through the mobile app today to make things easier for everyone. Got to the location, pulled forward to the window, and got no real greeting. He handed me the drinks and immediately asked me to pull out of the driveway and into the parking lot next door to wait for my food. Waited a few minutes & the food came out. Got home to find the chips are stale for the triple layer nachos, potatoes are wayyyyy over cooked so they are hard, did not get the nacho chips substituted in my meal box for which I paid extra for, taco was soggy like it had been waiting for awhile to be given in an order. This whole order was awful and this is not the first time they failed to give me the nachos instead of the cinnamon twists. I'll be going to the other location from now on.<//text>

< Review>
Went through drive thr I order my food but I noticed when I pulled up to the window the cashier was helping with making the food he was using the same latex gloves on the food after touching the cash or money it was horrible and than he notice that i noticed and he got so nervous so I asked him what's ur name are u the manager he said yes my name is Carlos but in the recipe it said Billy B I end up throwing food away do to covid 19 I didn't want to risk my life over this nucle head I can't believe he is the manager wow corporate needs to address this asap check cameras and ask this employees if they are not happy working there than go elsewhere and don't take it out on public also their attitude sucks, this is my recipe #365326 date 8/15/20 11:45:15pm</Review>

Used to be one of my go to fast food chains, but they got rid of my favorite item, the Double Decker.  R.I.P. Double Decker :=(  If you get rid of the Mexican Pizza and Baja Blast there will be zero reasons to run to the border.  Sad day.  2 stars for having 2 good items left on the menu.</text>

takes mobile orders at 11:29 then when you arrive at 11:45 to pick up your food, they insist that they’re closed. now i’m forced to file a complaint to get my money back from my *~legitimate~*order that they didn’t want to prepare. use some common sense and eat elsewhere.</text>

Ehhhh, not impressed.

I ordered a shredded chicken burrito for $2.78. The first 3 bites were just rice. Eventually I got to some chicken, but just a tad.
$2.78?
Really Taco Bell?
I also ordered a bean and cheese burrito that seemed to be twice the size as this useless chicken burrito.

Not only fast food- worthless fast food.

I am giving it 2 stars cause the employee was very nice.< /Text>

They food is good....well as expected which is good. I don’t care for the self service order portal. The staff seem a little inattentive because of it. There has been a couple of times I have visited and had to wait at the counter while one staff member is working the drive thru and the other is making orders in the back.< /Text>

This location however did mess up on the order and when addressing the mistake, i did ask for my item to be fixed, not replaced. The lady behind me said outloud, make sure she doesn't throw that away, but was ignored.  The girl at the register quickly disposed of my taco instead of just fixing it.  What a shame .

I ordered two items. A bean and rice burrito and another item.  It took over twenty minutes to get my order.  I asked what was taking so long.  I was told " we do the larger orders first."
How about first come first served.</review>

My sister ordered the steak burrito that must have been a foot long, covered in cheese and enchilada sauce. I asked for their spiciest hot sauce and they brought out a home made habanero sauce, so delicious! If I'm ever back in Montrose I'm definitely hitting this place up again! Service was great, attentive and very welcoming!<//Text>

<Text>Okay so this has been the first taco bell that I've gone too with really good customer service the guy(Ariel) who took our order was so funny! I get it I work in fast food as well we all have those rude customers, horrible busy days, don't want too deal with anyone.  you kinda get over customer service really quick ...  But the fact that he has so much enthusiasm and ensured we received our whole meal makes me want too come back .. Keep it up!!< /Text>< Response>

But it's not Mexican food ..
It's "Mexican style" food
If you want good street style tacos from mexico or type, well no.
A taco bell style cue consists of
A golden tortilla almost like toast in the shape of taco lettuce cheese and meat of the drinks not to mention are those of the typical fast food restaurants (there are no Mexican drinks of any kind)
It's not bad criticism, it's just the truth

(Original)
Fenomenal
Pero no es comida mexicana..
Es comida "estilo mexicana"
Si quieres unos buenos tacos del estilo callejeros de mexico o tipo asi pues no.
Un taco estilo taco bell consiste en
Una tortilla dorada casi como una tostada con forma de taco lechuga queso y carne de las bebidas ni hablar son las de los tipicos restaurantes de comida rapida (no hay bebidas mexicanas de ningun tipo)
No es una critica mala, solo es la verdad<//text>

(Translated by Google) Passing here is something exciting I like all the employees give a good service when what happens is that it is annoying that there is a lot of homeless that annoy customers that is the most annoying because they have money and spend it asking for more money It gives a bad impression at the beginning but then they tell them that it is time for Irae some get angry with them. Thanks for good service

(Original)
Pasar aca es algo emocionante me agradan todos los empleados dan un buen servicio cuando paso lo que si es molesto es que a un lado tenga muchos homeless que molestan alos clientes eso es lo mas molesto porque ellos tienen dinero y se la pasan pidoendo mas dinero eso le da una mala impresion al principio pero luego ellos los empleados les dicen a ellos que ya es hora irae algunos se enojan con ellos. Gracias por un buen servicio<//text>

<Text>Everyone I conversed with -- whether on the phone or in person -- was extremely kind, professional, and genuine.  They will even come to your place of business or home to do the work.  It started to rain, so I had to cancel the appointment and reschedule, but Orlando still came to me to meet and take a look at the car and let me know that they are there for me and he will be back Monday to do the repair.  He was so fast, quick and has so much passion.  He did a fabulous, fantastic job, and I was able to drive the car not too long after the installation was complete. Thank you, Orlando!  I am so pleased and extremely satisfied with my experience with Action Auto Glass!  I highly recommend to anyone!!! Thank you for your awesome service!< /Text>< Rate>

<text>I spoke with Luis over the phone and he set me up with an appointment right away. Wilbur came to fix my window and did an awesome job, as you can see. He’s was also very respectful and maintained his social distance and wore a mask throughout the whole process. Overall I had a great experience and would definitely recommend!<//text>< Name>

<review>The 2 guys that came out were awesome.  They called me before showing up to tell me where they were. They did a very professional job and knew actually what to do. Armando the boss was very nice on phone and gave a price which was very reasonable.  I highly recommend Action Auto Glass to anyone who needs a window replace. All were nice and polite which now a days is hard to find. Thank you very much for fixing my window. Perfect 👌.</review></record>

I was extremely happy with the service and work of this company. I was referred to them by my insurance company for a broken rear window in my Subaru Outback. My call was returned quickly; a technician came the next morning to look at the damage; the glass was ordered that afternoon; and it was installed at my home 3 business days later. Orlando (the technician) arrived exactly on time and was very polite and efficient, including clean-up; Luis in the office was helpful and always returned my calls. I highly recommend them.</review>

<date>1520315157787</date><Rate>5< /Rate><text>This past weekend we had some one break into our truck. My husband and I were devastated to see the damage in the morning. They had broken the 2 side windows. When I called Action Auto Glass in the morning, I could not contain my tears as I explained to Hector what had happened. Hector was so kind and helpful that he made the process of replacing the windows a smooth one. What felt like less then 20 mins of calling Action Auto Glass, I had someone at my house to replace the windows. The gentleman who arrived to install the windows was kind and assisted in cleaning up all the glass from inside our car and from the ground. I can't express enough, how truly thankful I am for all the staff I came in contact with at Action Auto Glass. Thank you!!<//text>< pics>

Raul helped me out with my wife’s windshield also advised me on how to save money by using my insurance. The installer who came was very nice and wore his mask which is a must during these COVID-19 times.

Highly recommend them.</text>

<text>Definitely recommend for providing prompt, professional services.  Spoke to Chris over the phone about what item and work was needed and the very next day he let me know the item arrived and a tech would be available the same afternoon to come by my house to install replacement.  We couldn’t have asked for anything better.  Thank u so much to Chris and team!< /text>< rating>

<text>I called and spoke to Chris in the morning and they had my windshield replaced the next day. The customer service by far is one of the best I've ever experienced! Starting with Chris all the way to the service men, and the pricnothing but perfection. 10/10 would recommend Action Auto Glass!< /text><time>1590790868988< /time>< user_id>

<review>This is a great company for windshield repair or replacement.  They spend a good bit of time to be very detailed and accurate with their work and do a comprehensive and great job.  I was impressed with their attention to detail.  If you need this type of work done, I think that this company would be a good one to use.</review>< Pics>

This place and employees were awesome!! My work van was broken into and drivers window was destroyed. I took it to these guys about 8 am ( this is after I was told by dodge dealership that it would take 2 days to order and repair). These guys said it would be done by 2pm that day. They called me back at 10:30am same and it was ready. I would highly recommend these guys to anyone for glass repair<//Text>

<text>They gave me an appointment the next day. On the day of the appointment, my phone was bugging which made it hard to coordinate a time. They gave me a 15 minute warning, texted, and emailed me and waited 10 minutes for me. I really appreciated the communication and commitment to helping me keep the appointment. Very nice and professional.<//text>< pics>

I had a great experience with Action Auto Glass recently for a windshield replacement. The person I spoke to on the phone to set up the appointment and find the right part was very nice and helpful. The technician who came to replace the window, Joseph, was also great. He updated me on his arrival time and finished the job quickly and professionally. I highly recommend this company!< /Review>

My windshield broke and I was quoted $450 by one of their competitors. Action Auto Glass saved me $170 and I had the windshield delivered and installed for $280. AMAZING!!! The technician, Jose, was punctual and wasted no time. He popped the old windshield out and had the new one installed in less than 45 minutes. He even put my new windshield wipers on free of charge. I'm extremely satisfied with my service and I would highly recommend Action Auto Glass to anybody. Thank you all so much!!!</text>

<text>Their prices are affordable and reasonable. Service is 5 star and trustworthy. I had my 2007 Camry crack while on the freeway. I had to exit and google searched for a replacement. They came up, great reviews and stopped by at their shop. I got lucky they had my wind shield in stock and took care of it in an hour.< /text>< user_name>

<Text>Had a 4 week delay because of Ray, the Action Glass employee in charge of the repair.  He said he submitted the necessary work on the claim and for 3 weeks blamed the delay on "hailstorms creating a backlog of claims."

Had a rock hit my windshield this morning so I looked online and saw found Action Auto Glass with around 50 reviews and a 4.5 out of 5 rating on yelp. I spoke with Ray and they were able to look at my car IMMEDIATELY! Turned out the rock strike was a double combo connected with a crack (a nightmare for MOST glass repairs techs). Chris did the repair on my car and did an absolutely WONDERFUL and FAST repair job. Both Chris and Ray were thoughtful, respectful, and you can see that they care about the customer. Total time from me arriving at their shop to me driving away was around 75 minutes and a more then fair price for the repair. THANK YOU Action Auto Glass for making my horrible morning not so bad and you have earned my business for life.</Text>

< review>
Ive eaten here twice, on my second visit I remembered right away why I hadnt returned sooner ( over a year). While on social media I got an add for thier pulled pork and decided I wanted to try it. I went on Tuesday and of course the pulled pork was only a special on a certain day. I wear contact's and have pretty good eyesight but that doesn't help read the menu. Its literally the smallest writing ive ever seen for a menu making paneras menu look like large font. I couod look past all that if the food was on point. But unfortunately it's not, I dont understand why an order of fried zucchini comes in a family size, and with no ranch to dip it in. I ordered 2 additional ranches assuming id have 4 of the small containers. The two I recieved didnt last long at all. More importantly I and my partner probably ate 1/3 the rest was wasted. I ordered a pastrami sandwich which was the only tasty part of my $25 meal the french roll was very soft and the meat was cooked perfectly. Thats the only reason im giving them 2 stars. Considering how large the zucchini portion was the french frys pprtion that came with my sandwich combo was measly and they were terrible not salted. I wasnt offered any salt or pepper, not even ketchup. Luckily I had some spare packets in my car. Lastly but most disgusting was the fountain drink.  I ordered a sprite but it tasted absolutely flat lemonade made with third world country tap water. This place has a great idea but they seriously need to get it together.  I dont recommend it.  I will never be eating here again or at least anytime soon</review>

<text>So I have lived here for almost 4 years and decided to try this place finally.  The traffic is super loud where the drive thru speaker is, so it makes it a bit difficult to order, but I am so glad that I decided to try this place out.  I got the mango habanero salmon with veggies and fried zucchini.  I have tried a lot of fried zucchini because we made it growing up, and this is the first place that made it absolutely perfectly!  It's crunchy and moist on the inside and the breading is perfectly dry and not greasy.  The salmon and veggies were spot on perfection!  My daughter said her grilled cheese sandwich was the best she has ever had.  Definitely returning here to try out more food on their many items to choose from.<//text>< Pics>

Medium rare = cooked to death. Not particularly seasoned either.
You really root for your local place to be great but this is a basic quality control issue. Not alright for a $15 item.< /review>

Delicious! Wife and I had the family tri-tip meal for dinner tonight. Daughter had Tri-tip Philly and son had a Double Bacon Cheeseburger. Funnel Fries for dessert. Left over Tri-tip, mashed taters & gravy, and veggies for lunch tomorrow.<//review>

I have always loved the fresh food and friendly service until today. The gentlemen that answered my phone order was nice and pleasant. The two girls in the background however were down right rude to say the least. The young girl who took over the phone call does not know the meaning of the phrase "customer service" They left the phone on the hook while they argued and complained about my order. The girl talked over me and never apologized for her rudeness and in fact was very condescending. I work close by and order from them often. Quite often these are big orders for our whole staff at work. NEVER AGAIN will I order from this place. It and the employees have gone down hill. Very sad, because like I said I have always loved this place in the past.<//Text>

I've tried this place about 3 times over the years, and every time it is a letdown. For what they charge, the food is mediocre at best. $16 for a lettuce-stuffed, burnt bread sandwich (no side) and a shake is ridiculous. Honestly, go to In-n-out down the road for a decent burger or an actual deli shop for a sandwich if you want something worth the cost.<//Review>

Good deal for the price all my friends enjoyed their meals. Fairly well priced for the quality of their food. But their burgers were pretty tasty. One thing is the atmosphere and the music in the restaurant matched. Very rare a restaurant had a rustic atmosphere with country and folk music.< /Review>

<Review>Great tasting food!, We had a carne asada burrito, bacon cheeseburger, regular burger, fries and onion rings. It was all delicious!. Service was as fast as it could be through the drive through, can't wait for all this PLANEDEMIC BS to be over so we can sit and eat inside again.

Great staff, going back tomorrow!...

Highly recommended!.... 👍</Review>< user_name>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Three of us were looking for lunch and found good reviews for Down Home Grill close to where we were.  It is a small place with a lot of take out and shared tables.  They have a good menu with breakfast and lunch choices along with good prices.  You order at the counter, no table service.  We each had something different.  One had Fried Shrimp and Fries and had enough to take some home.  Another had Strawberry Pancakes with Eggs, Bacon and Sausage and was really happy.  I had Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs and was also very happy.  All of us would go back and might even try something different next time.<//text>< pics>

Food is delicious.. I was asking the employees about the clover app, they knew nothing , they didn't know if they participated in the app but they are on the app and able to check in. There was no manager there to speak to and they couldn't give me a name of a manager to call.<//Text>

<text>Very disappointed with their food and customer service. On a busy day, employees were not organized, coursing, and blaming others for their errors. They were arguing back with customers because employees where giving away the wrong order to others. Not only did they give my order away to someone else, but their food was horrible—the fries were unhealthy and not edible. You can taste the fried chicken on their fries. Not only that, but the burnt oil on their fries were horrible. It almost tastes like they only changed the oil once a month. Also, their TBLTA was raw to the point I had to throw it away. Lastly, it took over an hour to get my food. This establishment did not have ice, soda refreshments. With their employees coursing, I would have to say I will never recommend this place to anyone or return. My recommendation to the owner or management is to close and retrain their employees and their cooks.</text>< pictures>

<review>Today was my first time trying their food and let me tell you they didn't disappoint. I got the tri tip special which came with mashed potatoes and gravy, corn on the cob and peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream all for $13 which i think is a great deal. Everything was delicious trip tip was well seasoned, tender and juicy. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for good food thats has an authentic home made taste.. Will definitely be visiting again.<//review>< rate>

I just got off work and decided I wanted to grab some dinner, came here and issues begun at the drive thru instantly.

I ordered a Portobello & Veggie on Ciabatta Sandwich for $8 and they had no idea what I was talking about, literally told me they were reading the menu to find it, gave up looking for it and insisted that I must have meant the Portobello Burger when I definitely did not. Then I ordered a Wild Caught Grilled Salmon that comes with a salad and your choice of Friend Zucchini, Fries, Quinoa or Rice

I chose Rice and then Ranch dressing.

I have no clue what they thought I ordered because then they started asking me what side I wanted and said that the rice was an addition on the side and wanted to know what I said “no” to when the word no or even the sound of the word “no” never left my mouth...

Took 8 minutes of back and forth to explain what I originally ordered and when I finally got it all corrected, they admitted to thinking I ordered the Pineapple & Habanero Salmon which has its own special sides.

Took a very long time to get the food from the window, had to use the drive thru for safety reasons during the Covid pandemic.

Once we got our food, I drove around the corner to park so I could eat while the food was at its hottest.

First off, everything was cold, hard and stiff.

The salmon smelled off, really off, it’s cooked weirdly and they managed to make it look more like chicken than salmon. They also listed this as Wild Caught, when it clearly wasn’t, wild caught salmon will always have a national pink tint too it and farm salmon will be grey, typically dyed pink by the farmers before they send it out to stores. This salmon is white, very white. It was also overcooked and dryer than the sand in this desert.

The rice that came with the salmon definitely isn’t fresh, it was hard, stiff and clumped together into huge blocks. It was either from the refrigerator or it was cooked in the morning then put into a cooling area for hours and never mixed around. Anyone that serves rice at a restaurant knows that you need to keep the rice warm and mixed well after cooking to keep it fluffy and soft. Just from this dish alone I can tell that this restaurant is either ignoring the basics or they simply don’t care to get the proper training, the rotten fish is a huge no no also, i don’t know how anyone could serve this with how awful it smells.

The salad overall was fine, a typical basic salad, really hard to mess up, but then the dressing was like the mucus of an egg, so thick that it held the salad still while I held the container sideways, the dressing also had a terrible after taste that leads me to say that it was likely off as well, just like the salmon (picture was taken at home because I drive home right after seeing how awful the food was so I could start cooking)

The Portobello Burger which wasn’t even what I originally tried to order first off, was completely soaked this a thick mayo tasting Aioli, they had it under and above every single topping which leads me to believe that they put it on after every topping to really drowned this Burger in it. Likely they did that to drowned out the flavor of their Mushroom, it was colder than the food in my refrigerator, looked like someone had flattened it as all the spines underneath and the sides were crushed flat and mushy. The bread was so thick compared to the mushroom and honestly the bread took up 80-90% of the sandwiches size and when you take a bite into this, the bread is all you taste and feel, then you get a small sliver of ice cold vegetables.

They charged me $25 for this, honestly disgusting, they don’t know how to cook in my opinion and I’ve been working in food for years.< /Text>< pictures>

Pick up only because of the pandemic. The meatloaf dinner was very good. The "smoked" chicken turned out to be barbecued chicken, and really pretty dry at that. The staff did seemed to be friendly enough.<//text>

I cannot recommend this place highly enough! The food is Delicious, especially the breakfast food. The staff are some of the nicest people in the area.
I've been here many times and not once have I been disappointed, I figured it was about time I give them the review they deserve.</Review>

Best food in town period ! Absolutely wonderful staff. Love the atmosphere and the huge table that invites total strangers to converse over a meal. Feels like home.Over time I felt like the chicken tender quality has decreased. Where when I first came they were the size of my hand. 6 GIANT chicken fingers. Now they are a decent size but about half of what they were. They still taste delicious with buffalo sauce or ketchup.< /Text>

<review>Came here to try it for the first time, since we been quarantine and making food at home I figure it was a good time to help local business and order some food through drive thru, the people who work here are amazing and so is the food, paid $73 and it fed 7 people and a dog, great spot to enjoy some amazing food plus it helps the community. Stay safe and blessed</review>< pics>

My wife and I went there yesterday I ordered a plain double cheese burger and fries. My wife ordered the western chicken salad. My burger had everything on it and some sauce that was terrible. The fries were basically raw and soggy I couldn’t eat them. My wife asked what was on the salad the girl said the normal. What is a normal salad? Every place puts different things on their salads. So my wife asked well can you tell me what you put on your normal chicken salad? She was told lettuce, croutons, chicken and olives. What they put on the salad was no croutons black beans ( I guess she thought they were olives) corn and a chipotle sauce. She never said corn, black beans or chipotle sauce. Top it off the total for this junk was $27.41. We came home and threw it in the trash. I will never go back you would think as long as you wait in the drive thru they would get your order right.<//Review>

Came with no dressing the Ahi was rotten and soggy  and the mandarins tasted fermented.  Really disappointed because it's always a hit for miss if it's going to be good. For the price food should always be consistent and good.  Very sloppy...Extremely disappointing.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c3641f79da3fc1:0xdcea9abdc0ecac54< /GmapID></record>

<Review>The cook was confused between a cob salad and a cod dinner. the food we did have was okay. The service was less than exceptional.the location of this restaurant is less than ideal. It is actually connected to a liquor store and it's a little confusing to find this restaurant.< /Review>< Time>

<review>Food was great tasting! Steak sandwich, Club sandwich onion rings and fries.  This was my first visit...during the Stay At Home orders. We chose the drive-thru option. Slightly priced higher but so worth it. There was a wait in line but I do plan on returning.< /review>< pictures>

Can't say enough positive about this place.  Even though it has a drive through, it is still one of the highest quality restaurants in the entire High Desert.

Good food. Super nice employees.  And they usually have an IPA or two on tap too.< /Text>

I absolutely love this place. The food is always so fresh and I like that there is a drive-thru option. Expect to wait a little while if you use the drive through, but it's only because you're getting amazing fresh food. They are also fairly priced for the quality of product that you get.< /Text>

<Review>Just what I was looking for. I was able to get a Gluten Free Hamburger with fries and a drink and it all was delicious. I will be returning. Only downside was the wait time but you gotta be understanding that they have a drive thru as well, so you just gotta be patient.<//Review>< pictures>

We liked the food. The staff wasnt very friendly, but they weren't rude either. There was 4 cashier's at the counter but we weren't acknowledged for about 10 minutes after we walked in.

We will probably go again, we just wont expect friendliness along with the good food.< /Text>

<review>Me and my wife enjoy the atmosphere here. Big American flag painted on the wall (with all 50 stars, yes I counted) the food here is delicious. Their prices are reasonable considering a lot of their menu has organic ingredients. They also have neat black pipe/Edison bulb fixtures that look really nice.</review><pictures>None</pictures><UserId.>100507333027076345086< /UserId.>< Rating>

I'm not going to blame the food, but it could of been me that day, but when I ate a burger here once I got food poisoning, but that didn't stop be from eating it all, no regrets it was VERY decent but I'm not picky.. sorry for sounding mean over the getting sick part but that's what made me not try to visit this place anytime soon, still good food though!</Review>

Best burgers in the high desert. WELL worth the drive from wherever! And definitely Not the hole in the wall you expect from the location, take it from an old country antiques dealer this place has REAL " country antique " ambience.<//Text>

<Text>Was very disappointed when I was told they have organic food, but when I asked if any of there vegetables were organic they said no. I also asked if there turkey was hormone & antibiotic free they didn't know so I asked if they could call the owner they did and he said NO. They didn't know if the chicken was hormone & antibiotic free either , owner said Yes on chicken. Workers need to know more about the food they r preparing and serving there customers. I would like more food places in the high desert to serve organic foods.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Food is prepared quickly.  Service is excellent.  Meals are generous.  Menu is varied but relies heavily on fried food.  Quality is good and the prices over value.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Love this place. Food is amazing, staff is friendly, and prices are good. I get the organic chicken rice bowl, and everytime I am blown away from the flavor. Their nachos are also really amazing. A must stop for fresh tasty food. And amazing staff. Seriously the staff are amazing!</review>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Today was my first time trying Home Town Grill.  I called my order in and picked it up at the drive thru.  It was ready when I got there, and it was delicious.  $9 for the shrimp basket that has popcorn shrimp, and I had zucchini. The portions were so big that I can have two meals of it. The salad was delicious including black olives and croutons.  Everything was perfectly cooked.  Lots of dressing and cocktail sauce was included.  I highly recommend Home Town Grill if you want really good food for a reasonable price.< /review>< user_id>

Food great that's speaks for itself. The small town charm is the best. It's a bit Cozy with one long table. Makes it nice for our community to sit together and get to meet some friendly faces. . Try it out your self and get a. Taste of the down home .</Text>

This place is great. Love how they source and prepare the food. Appreciate the option of a drive thru to keep the options open. Everything I've had has been delicious. Personal favs are the fried olives and mushrooms. Delicious.< /Review>

We love the food here and have been regulars for 2 years. Most of the staff here including some of the managers are unfriendly, so we love to come in when Melissa is working. She is so outgoing and friendly to everyone. Lots of vegetarian options with organic food. Check this place out!</Text>

Great food and prices. Always been a good experience when I go. Friendly staff and the wait isn't too bad. The steak dinner and pastrami are our favorites. Definitely worth checking out if you haven't yet.< /Review>

Dirty tables, and dirty dishes everywhere. The Chicago dog that I ordered had onions and cabbage, ( not a Chicago dog) no mustard, pickle, or tomato. They completely forgot the BLT that was also ordered. They brought chopped tomatoes in a dirty container with grease marks on it, after they brought the forgotten BLT. By that time the Chicago dog was cold. Worst food and service that I have had in a very long time. I will never go back!< /review>

The good is decent.
Customer service is usually decent as well.
Prices continue to rise.
Waiting 35 minutes as the second car in the drive through really sucks.< /text>

<text>By far one of my favorite places to eat. The staff is the best! My food is always amazing. Just make sure to ask for your fries to be fresh. It is such a great vibe here. Always spotless and nicely decorated. They have a drive thru which is great when you want home cooked type food on the go. Be warned this place is popular and has extremely limited seating.</text><rating>5<//rating>< gmap_id>

Sorry to say, once again if you go through the  Drive thru check your order before you leave..because your order is most likely wrong. But they sure charge you correctly..not the 1st,  2nd or third other wise i would not bash a small business..Get It Right All The Time Please..<//text>

This was the first time I went to Down Home Grill, and it was a delightful visit. It was later in the afternoon, but I wanted the pork chop breakfast, I was disappointed no breakfast after around 11a.m., but the waitress suggested the pork chop dinner which came with a salad, fresh veggies, mashed potatoes and a large pork chop. I got my meal and could barely wait to get home to eat it! It was more than delicious and all fresh ingredients. (Did I mention I used the drive thru and got fast and friendly service, they also give senior discounts) I will be back again.🤗< /Text>

I took a staff member there for lunch.  Even though they were quite busy, the servers/cashiers were attentive and courteous.  I will go again.  When busy be prepared to wait for seating!  Food was great👍< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>Quality of food has degenerated to disgusting. My fries were soaked in oil and soggy; literally made me gag and spit the food out. My BLT was subpar.  Customer service has reduced to arguing with the customer and being condescending; refused to listen in order to resolve the problem, just arguing.  Was told that no one has ever complained about their fries.  It is obvious that they are not reading all the reviews.  Shame on you for your lack of management skills and quality control.  I will never return and will never recommend this place.< /text>< Pics>

I love there strawberry waffle and at lunch there chicken strips. Just know if they are busy you may have to wait so call a head or plain accordingly but well worth the wait.</Review>

Best menu choices for healthier options in town. We love to come to this place and eat. Some of the staff is unfriendly (Tammy) but if your lucky enough to come in when Melissa is working you'll definitely get why they call it Down home. She and most of the staff are welcoming and friendly each visit. The quality of the food is definitely worth your hard-earned dollar. It would be completely unfair to the rest of the staff to put Tammy the eyeroller ( she littery does this in front of you) completely rude behavior towards guest on them. Most of the staff go out of thier way to be kind while  she is rude and unprofessional towards guest. we have been regulars for 2 years and NOT 1 Positive experience with her. Not one visit where she was anything but aloof and rude.  This the VERY BIG downside of coming here!! We are always relieved when she is not working.< /review>

I really loved this place but this time it wasn't the same. My pastrami had only meat and bread, our burgers were pretty dry and lacking sauce. Just wasn't the same. This was most likely much last visit.<//Review>

<text>When they opened the food was great but the last couple of times I've been the food quality has gone down along with the customer service and the prices were raised. Burger is ok but the fries are always way to oily and give me a stomach ache. Better burger spots out there for the price and quality.< /text><rating>3< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Hidden Jem. Great prices and great food. Opens early for breakfast at 5am. Also has a drive through if your in a hurry but want to eat good food that's fast, not fast food that's good. Don't let the drive up window fool you, the interior is small, but clean, cozy, and charming. A big plus is that the server beer on tap, but this is not a bar. Bring your family. Oh, and the ahi salad is AMAZING, and I think it was only $10. Try it with a Hanger Orange Wheat beer, pairs perfectly!</review>

<Review>The service was quick and the food was really good (cheeseburger). I swear I got two potatoes worth of fries also, which is never a bad thing.. They taste like in-n-out fries. 🍟< /Review></record>

<Review>The food was tasty a little bit on the small side. I had the French Dip sandwich, fries and a lemonaid. $12 and change.

Reminds me of the old Wendy's commercial with that little old lady saying, ... "Where's The Beef?"</Review>< pictures>

It's a tiny place,  but the food is good and they have some great beer on tap,  definitely try it if you want something other than your normal chain restaurants!  The staff was very friendly as well👍< /review>

Prices went up but its still the same mediocre service... Fries are always soggy and soaked in grease and the burger is hit or miss sometimes. Need to work on quality control and tightening up the staff to be a little more professional.< /text>

Great food with great staff! I'm giving three stars, though, because they an unsolvable space problem. They're getting pretty popular, and my group of 5 had trouble finding a place to sit down and eat. Also, they can chill out a little on the amount of salt they put on their fries.</Text>

<Text>Food is good.  Recent price increases make it not worth it any more.  Service has also gone down.  Orders are frequently made wrong. I will probably continue to go but it will be far less frequent.< /Text>< name>

Going for a nice quick place to eat Down Home Grill is the place to go. If you're looking for some dessert that is nice and unique I highly suggest this place get some deep fried Oreos and you'll be addicted to him they're amazing it's delicious.</review>

<Date>1499315742337< /Date><Text>I ordered fish tacos and an ahi tuna salad.  I anticipated a wait for fresh food. However,  the fish tacos were soggy fish sticks with lettuce and a huge gob of garter sauce on a corn tortilla. The cilantro aioli is gross and thick and tastes nothing like cilantro. Just a garlic mayo. Super disappointed. This is the third time I visit, and I've been disappointed each time. Definitely over sold and under delivered.</Text></record></dataset><record>

It's been hit and miss for us. Have had overcooked burgers with wilted lettuce and a burrito that just didn't taste right. With that being said, we tried the kabobs the other night and they were delicious. Hopeful they are picking up their game.</review>

A few weeks ago had ordered carne asada burrito. 8 bucks. Came home with it and meat was burnt and just didn't taste fresh. Called them and they replaced it with the way the food normally comes out. Great!!!! 4 stars for the team there.< /Review>

Good burgers, fries, and sides.  A little pricy.  I would give 5/5 for the old prices before the increase.   The organic ingredients make it worth it.< /Text>

<Review>Secret, Secret I have a Secret….

Down Home Grill is Victorville’s best kept secret.  This step saving restaurant catering to those seeking down home cooking on the fly is this gems specialty that includes a better than average price point.  Though it is a fast food environment with a down home flare.   The owner of this drive thru, take out or dine-in seating for about 25 people clearly has their heart invested and it shows in the large portions of food and remarkable staff.  If you’re hungry  stop by this cozy little restaurant with big heart….  you won’t leave disappointed!  Tell them A J from Google Local Guides sent you.  Enjoy.</Review>< pics>

Always loved this place, this morning came in for breakfast with my wife and finally had to leave due to a large table of drunks. I won't ever return. Lots of options.</text>

<rate>2</rate><text>First time trying it this evening; my wife ordered the food over the phone. I went to pick it up, and had a great experience. The staff were very friendly and seemed to keep a nice, clean and organized kitchen. Bomb! Definitely worth stopping through if you haven't already! We got the salmon salad and ortega chili burger with zucchini. 👍👍

Aaaaaaand.... Nevermind...

As much as I hate to say... Today, for our second visit we had a terrible experience. Onion rings were very overdone and were obviously held in a hot hold for quite some time. I do realize that I came in right before closing.. But c'mon guys, a solid preclose should never compromise the quality of the food... Don't batch cook after 8. Everything cook to order. I had a great guest experience with the gentleman up front while putting in my phone order and picking it up. The cashier had to remind the cook to add bacon on my chili burger... Which I'm not joking..  Had about a tablespoon of chili on it.. It was a pure joke and disappointing experience as opposed to my first time. I bought my wife a bacon burger combo with fries.. Fries were non- existent, burger was okay.. Again with the batch cooking (in regards to the bacon).... I called to let them know that they forgot my fries so that I could come in for them... The kid told me that I could come in on another day for my (paid) French fries as "compensation".. Which makes NO sense.. After telling him that he offered one bacon burger with it... My wife is pregnant and wanted some damn French fries tonight... And I wanted a delicious chili cheese burger... This was a TERRIBLE experience.. And please, to the owner... That is serious advice to maintain food quality throughout slow business hours.. Batch cooking wastes food and ultimately lowers the quality of things. I would seriously seek more experienced cooks with higher standards for YOUR restaurant.. You've got a good thing going... Dont let your employees mess that up ever. Quality is the biggest priority always.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<text>Claims to be organic, but mostly it's only the meat. Sodas are typical high-fructose corn syrup, salad dressings are not organic or non-gmo, orange juice has 0% juice, lemonade had a strange after taste, the French dip sandwich tasted bad, cheese on the nachos was processed cheese like Velveta. I wouldn't go again.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Love the food here! The only problem is if you go during peak hours finding seating might be difficult.</Text>

<Response>None< /Response><time>1482539424916<//time><text>Typical of food places up here. Provide amazing food & service initially. As time goes both food quality & service drop to below McDonald's standards. When a customer asks for certain condiments you should provide them. When a customer even goes as far as to say "I'll pay for them" provide them. Don't say it's ok we got this. Don't lie at the window about it. Today wasn't the first time. Also, besides asking for condiments how can this establishment send out a salad with no dressing. Send out an appetizer without sauce. Ridiculous. When they first opened their salads were top notch. Today & few other times in the past the salad is filled with iceberg not the good stuff. 1/2-3/4 of it is the white center of the head of lettuce. Hard & huge pieces. Where there is lettuce in here a majority of it is brown. The entire salad is sopping wet with water. Disgusting!
I'm only giving 1 star because I have too.

This review was left months ago idk why it's showing up today.

This place is still horrendous & I hope they go out of business soon. My mother went there tonight. I go to cut in half a bean & cheese burrito & it smells so bad. Like dog food or feces! Maybe the beans have spoiled idk but to serve this is despicable & truly reprehensible.
Pay full price for fried olives get 1/2 a serving. Shut your doors already.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Food good as always, crowded as always, still not enough seating as always, red chairs for customers still not comfortable. If you don't mind waiting for a seat or taking it home, come check them out<//text>
