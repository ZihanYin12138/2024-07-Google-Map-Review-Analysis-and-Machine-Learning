It's a cute little spot in downtown Willow Glen and the staff is always very friendly. Before the pandemic, I would get my lashes done by Jennifer. I'm not sure if she is still there or not but Phuongmai did my lashes today. She is super nice and my lashes came out great! Love them!!

There wasn't another customer in the salon when I was there and it definitely made me feel more comfortable but I'm sure they take all the proper precautions when there is more than one client in the salon.</Text>

Jen looked after me and I have to say she was meticulous. Very gentle even while removing my lashes. I got mink lashes done and Am very happy with the end result. I wish this shop was in Melbourne. Highly recommend.</Review>< pictures>

Really great, friendly customer service! Had an appointment, and they got me ready pretty quickly despite how busy it was. Yun did my haircut and styled it so beautifully cuz I told her I was attending a wedding. Will Definitely come back for future cuts or color! Only drawback is limited parking. So small and narrow. So go early!<//text>

Lashes are life!! Everything is wonderful from the moment you walk in the door. The shop is super cute, and they always have great music. I have been going to Rachel for some time, and she is very friendly and professional. My lashes are always perfect. You can tell the love and passion Rachel has for what she does in the quality off work she does.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I have been coming to Bloom for regular appointments for the last year and have loved every experience. I’ve had different people do my lashes and each one of them has been very attentive, accommodating and made me feel at ease. The first appointment was the longest but after awhile you get used to having them done. I opted to get the allergy test and have gone with mink lashes since I didn’t have a reaction to the glue or lashes.

I am also a huge fan of their lash wash. It definitely helps keep your lashes in tact longer! I went a few weeks relying on my face wash but I definitely noticed the difference. I ❤️Bloom and love supporting a local business!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Had my first refill appointment today with Desiree and she was just great! She recommended a hybrid refill for a more full look and they turned out amazing! She was so nice and fun to talk to during my appointment it felt like she was done in no time! The gal that checked me out up front was just as nice and even told me about their ways to save money on appointments ( star program, paying in cash, ect). These girls never disappoint! ❤️< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Eyelash strips were no longer working for me. I decided to opt for eyelash extensions and I chose Bloom because of its great ratings. Being new to the eyelash game, I didn’t know who to choose or what style to choose. I chose Tricia as my eyelash technician. I am beyond satisfied with her work and feel extremely happy with my eyelashes!  She really listened to what I wanted and DELIVERED. She made me feel very comfortable and getting my eyelashes placed was so relaxing and felt pretty good.  The environment is so supportive of relaxation and not to mention, it is adorable!  I literally have not wore a drop of make up since getting my eyelashes done. I feel so beautiful. My lashes lasted over 3 weeks. Barely shed and when I went in for my refill they still looked great! Job well done. Thank you Tricia!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

This time I knew I definitely wanted a more dramatic look but still natural and not too vegas looking! Lia gave me just that! I LOVE my lashes and I can't wait to go back and see Lia for my fill. I highly recommend coming to bloom if you're looking to get lashes and book with Lia! She's lovely and great at what she does :)</Review></record>

What a fabulous place for a first timer like me getting lashes. Tonya was professional and after the appointment I felt like she was a friend. My lashes looked beautiful and 2 weeks later they still look beautiful! I highly recommend Bloom and look forward to my next visit.<//text>

Sarah, the owner does impeccable work! Truly an artist who cares about her clientele looking beautiful.  Her eyelash work lasts forever and look natural. She is the best!
Did mine by another person and i simply feel that i better find myself waiting to have them done by Sarah because she is simply the best! Highly recommend her!</Text>

<text>I went to Bloom this week to get my lashes done for the first time. The staff were super nice and welcoming, and the facility was clean and cute! I spent about 2 hours here, but it was truly worth it. Not only did the lashes look amazing, but the costumer service was great as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for pressionally done lashes in a clean and cute environment. Go see Maria, she's the best!!</text>< pictures>

I have been to this location 3 times first time I went to get allergic reaction test I walked in early and was greeted and taken in right away. For my actual lash appointment I got there filled out and read all the consent forms picked out the kind of lashes I wanted. Met LIA and discussed what I wanted she got to work right away making sure everything was comfortable LIA made the whole experience amazing I would recommend going to her. My lashes  lasted about 3 weeks with no major fall out I went in for a refill. I absolutely love them I'm hooked. I recommend buying the cleaning solution for lashes to last longer. The facility is clean and decoration is Super cute staff is super friendly. They recommend taking headphones but I didn't mind the music they play and Lia is great to conversat with. Definitely worth checking out.</Review>

I had previously been to Bloom for two full sets followed by multiple fills. I had not set on any one aesthetician. For my third full set, I was scheduled with Phuongmai. Her work is impeccable. She does a nice job of explaining if your requests are possible. If it is not possible, she will explain why so you understand. I have seen her now for two more fills and always leave with my lashes looking amazing. Her attention to detail and conversation have me coming back!<//review>

<Review>I'd been to a number of different places to have my lashes done when a friend recommended Carol at Bloom. Carol is so sweet and super friendly! My lashes look great and the best part is she is fast! I'm in and out in 30-45 minutes. All the other places I've been to took twice as long. My lashes look great and last just as long! Bloom is very cute and it's always clean and inviting. I'd highly recommend trying out Bloom.</Review><name>Marna Grigorieff</name>< gmap_id>

First time EVER for me to have my lashes done. BLOOM was recommended by a friend, so I looked them up. With my friend's recommendation & the customer reviews, I decided to give BLOOM a try. The location was easy to find and I had no problems w/ parking. The boutique is SUPER cute & clean. Danielle is very pleasant & informative. She helped me choose which style to go with. She did a BEAUTIFUL job and they turned out better than I expected. I scheduled my next appointment with her before I left.< /Review>

I had never had my lashes done before so when I went in, I believe her name was Alyse, helped me to figure out if I wanted to go more full or natural. She even explained the process and wrote down what sizes she used so that if I wanted to change it up we would know! I can't wait to go back for my fill in a few weeks!!

I've been going to Bloom for a while now and just love the way my lashes look! It is such a relaxing experience when I get my lashes done at Bloom and the eyelash technicians & staff are friendly and helpful. Often I get compliments on how my lashes look.

Another GREAT lash refill from Gina!   Always on time, super sweet and always so professional!   I have never left disappointed. 3 of my friends have also gone off of my referrals and also loved their lashes!  I enjoy my hour of relaxation and time in the salon!  Cant wait for Prom to roll around, my daughter wants the lash experience too! I would highly recommend Gina if you are looking for lashes.</review>

I  no longer get eyelash extensions, but have moved on to getting lash lifts. My lashes are long and straight and when I curl them they like to fall out (or I pull them out somehow) so I don't bother. The lift curls them back without issue, plus the SPM makes it costly, but acts like long lasting mascara. I even put on extra mascara when I do my makeup. Sarah does a excellent job. This is way more low maintenance and this suits me better then the extensions. It last as long as 3-4 weeks for me. FYI parking is in the back.< /Text>

I had what I was told was a keratin lash lift.
I'm sure it was a lash perm.  Not as advertised. 1 eye turned out well. Other is way too curled. My lashes are uneven and even though they were nice enough to try to correct the issue it did not work and now I feel I should have gone to another shop.  Disappointed for sure. Also they have their voice mail pick up most calls. I didn't think it was very personable<//Review>

Love my Lashes!
"Mimi is my Lashologist ... We started with a natural longer look and have quickly moved to the fuller look. LOVE THEM. She always asks if there were any issues or challenges. Appts are easy to schedule and she is always on time/pleasant. I'm sure I'm going to ask her for MAX GLAM for a special event with the holidays coming."< /Review>

"Maria did a good job. got me in right at my appointment time and from there it was a comfortable 2 hours. for sure recommend bringing something to listen to as its a long time to lay there. my eyes stung a bit and they are still a bit red the next day. however they noted this and said it will pass. overall a good experience.

Yuri, my technician, was very sweet and professional. The entire process took the expected 2 hours and my lashes look FAB.

Bloom really makes sure you understand just what you need to do to take care of your lashes to make them last as long as possible. Can't wait to book my next appointment for a refill. <3</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< Review>
I loved my lashes! Lia did an amazing job applying my mink full set of lashes. They looked so incredibly natural, but still gave my eyes tons of drama. I have even stopped wearing as much makeup because the lashes are making me feel so confident, and thats unheard of for me. The cost is definitely worth it, they lasted so long! About 6 weeks. And that was with me being slightly rough with them. I will definitely going back to her!</Review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>What a waste of money, travel and time. They had gotten some great reviews so I thought this would be my new lash spot. I have a Groupon for $85 for last extensions. when I went there The Stylist told me if I want to have the full look and if thicker longer lasting glue is extra 50 bucks. My lashes last less than 24 hours. They do have a good policy where you can come back in and they'll try to patch it up within a certain period of time. I think the patch up eyelash stylist was good however it did not last< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1538110415718, 'text': 'Hi Sallee. Sorry for the confusion with your appointment. We want all our clients to be happy with our services. The $50 lash boost is for volume lashes. We use the same adhesive no matter what style you choose. Classic lash extensions are one per eyelash, which look beautiful. Volume lashes are several lashes per lash for clients that want some added drama, more lashes then you naturally have. If you would like to come back in we are happy to replace any and all lashes that have shed as long as it is within five days of your appointment. Lashes do take some extra care. They need to be cleansed daily or they will shed quickly. We can try to figure out why they have shed. Please give us a call at your convince 408-280-5377. We are here and happy to help :)'}< /response>< gmap_id>

The owner, Sarah, is very good. My eyes have never shown up in pictures before, and she chose the proper length so my lashes stand out and look natural. I've been a customer for five years.<//review>

I followed Crystal from a Los Gatos hair salon and can't see changing her.
She understands hair-- with great technical ability for great cuts and color.
Not to mention, she is so sweet and caring.
Oh, yes she does all the Bridal hair styles--totally amazing! If I had to do it again, hmmm...maybe for when we renew our vows ;-)<//review>< pictures>

I asked to try open eye look since i usually get natural look. Well i didnt get what I asked for. Took the lady 3hrs to do my lashes & i dont even think she finished cuz i had another place i had to b at & had to leave after bring there for a lil over 3hrs. Disappointed with the outcome. Eye lashes arent even long in length the way i usually get them. Cant really tell i have them on. Lady was really nervous cuz someone walked in asking for everyone id working there for what ever reason. Lady was shakin alot during my eye lash appt. Was so excited to have extension in time for Valentine's day but literally feel like i paid for nothing. I've gotten extensions before and always have looked fuller then what they are. And never stuck laying down for exactly 3hrs. I still tip her but felt i shouldnt of, she was nice but took way to long & did it her way i guess not they way i asked. Feel like I got ripped off...... Manager responded & fixed my issue. Thanks for the great customer service< /text>< pictures>

I bought a bloom Vitamin C with Microdermabrasion facial from Groupon. I was a little nervous because you never know what you are going to get with groupon sometimes. At the last minute my childcare fell through and I had to bring my 5 year old daughter with me. When we first walked in, my first impression was that this place is adorable; the decor is as my daughter said "soo pretty!". Right away we were greeted and offered water. Gina gave me my facial, and she was amazing. She was so sweet to my daughter, who was of curious about everything. My facial left my skin smooth, with a dewy glow, I would definitely go back again.< /text>

This is my second time getting mink lashes and I definitely will be coming back to Bloom on a regular. I purchased a Groupon for a full set, and booked my appointment through their online system on their website. It was super easy and there were tons of appointment options. I received a couple of appointment confirmations, and even got a phone call the morning of to let me know there was an event going on in downtown Willow Glen so Sarah gave me some great directions that helped me get to their studio pretty easily.

The boutique itself was adorable. The music, the ambiance, and the overall experience was great. I was so comfortable while Kennia was doing my lashes I almost fell asleep two times. Kennia was super sweet, and made sure to check if I was okay throughout the process. My appointment started at 11, and I was out of there by 12:30. QUALITY vs quantity. My first experience I was in there for about 45 minutes and my lashes didn't feel nearly as comfortable as they did this time around.

I really appreciate the time and attention to detail Kennia spent on my lashes, and they look absolutely perfect! I will be definitely coming back for refills. Lash extensions are addicting :D<//text>

<user_name>Mike Tallent<//user_name><Resp>{'time': 1355453050022, 'text': 'I am the owner of Bloom. We have apologized several times to Mike T. and his girlfriend for of the inconvenienced of Crystal having to reschedule a hair appointment due to illness. We do on occasion have to reschedule appointments. This is not something that happens often. Crystal called to let the girlfriend know around 10:30am that she needed to reschedule the 3pm appointment. She offered her other dates and times she could come in. We did not hear back from her for four days, she sent Crystal a text after 9:30PM on Sunday evening, well after business hours that she wanted to come in the very next day Monday at 2pm. Because Crystal did not hear back from her she had already booked her schedule. We also have proof of this. We care very much about our boutique and our customers. We are proud of the fact that we are a small boutique. This enables us to give our customers personalized service. We know we can not please everyone but we do try our very best. We have fulfilled hundreds of groupons for happy customers.  We have offered to return the Groupon (I personally called Groupon and it is now up to them to contact Groupon directly) Crystal offered to come in on her day off and stay after hours to accommodate the appointment, give a free service and reimburse them for gas. Mike has told me via text that if we give a free service he will take off a review and stop the media assassination against Bloom. Due to the amount of harassment and media slander received we felt the need to contact the authorities and we have been advised not to allow the appointment. A report has been made and legal action will be pursued. We at Bloom refused to be threatened and bullied. I would like to reiterate how much we care about each and every one of your clients. We have many loyal customers that have been coming to our boutique for years. It is so important to us that our clients, both new and established, are given the excellent customer service they deserve. It saddens us greatly that this issue with Mike T. and his girlfriend has arisen and has become elevated to this level. In the end, all we can hope is that the outcome is a positive one. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Bloom Boutique.'}<//Resp><Text>This Bridal Shop is a complete Scam. They advertise on Groupon and get people interested and then they don't have the employees to handle the work and cancel on you at the last minute. My GF had an appointment with Crystal Anderson who suppose to be the Master Stylist. Upon Driving to San Jose from Turlock, Crystal suddenly came down with the flu. Over 100 miles of driving into another town and at the last minute she is cancelled. The owner Sarah Pena told my GF she was in Disneyland and she only has 1 stylist. They have a GROUPON offer and they have 1 Stylist but said she can get us in on Monday.

Today on Monday the story changed again and the next time she can get her in is Thursday.

Unless you have endless time and want your entire wedding Ruined by employees and a bridal shop that can't handle your business. DO NOT GO HERE! This would be the very very last place on the Planet to go to.

We are looking at another place and making sure Nobody gets ripped off and has their days wasted like we have.

I have text messages and emails to back all this information up.</Text></record>

False Eyelashes didn’t last at all. By day three I was finding lashes everywhere. In all they lasted about 6 days and by day 8 every one of them had fallen off. Only reason I gave it two stars and not one is because of the customer service!</Text>

I love this place. I finally got a serious turntable / receiver / speaker setup back in November and these guys have been my go-to. Their new section is on point but so is their used stuff. And every used record I've gotten from them has been in near mint condition. They are affordable and give you 10% off if you spend $100. They are also incredibly safe and conscious of the pandemic. Highly recommend.<//Review>

<date>1616480494167<//date><text>Really over priced. Fun to browse but you have to search and search for a good deal. Staff was pretty rude when I tried to trade in some high quality records I had duplicates of. The guy working didn’t want to answer any of my questions, and I felt like I was bothering him just by being there. Too bad it’s basically the only records store in Sherman Oaks.< /text><user>116122430915005166243<//user><Rate>1</Rate><gmap_id>0x80c29628ef42aa3d:0x6c585b6d9019448<//gmap_id>< resp>

I love this tiny record store. I usually show up, pick a half a dozen or more used records, listen to them while no one bothers me. They never push you to buy anything, they answer all your questions (if any). While it naturally and expectedly lacks the variety and volume of Amoeba, it easily beats the impersonal vastness of a that huge store with the cozy feeling of a mom and pop store..</text>

I love this place! great music choices! They have a bigger section for Records, but their Cds section has all types of music. I enjoy coming to listen some music and I always end up buying one or two Cds, their prices are great!</Text>

<text>Great find!

First of all, the music welcomes. I heard jazz, punk, pop, electronic. I need to know more about the playlist. This alone made the visit super enjoyable.

Second, there is so much vinyl. Huge bins of random used records, 45s and LPs, for cheap- most for 99¢. There is also a well-organized section of higher quality items; new stuff, used stuff in great shape, some collectible things. I wish I could have spent more time.

Third, there are lots of CDs, used and new, and even a decent selection of used DVDs.

The place wasn't packed, but there were several customers browsing around.  You get the feeling the product is turning over. The proprietor was super nice, is clearly passionate about music, and promoting a quality experience.

<text>Check the condition of your records carefully before buying!! I purchased a hard to find classical album for $30 and it has subtle scratches that are hard to see but so deep as to ruin the listening. This is partly my fault, but I buy all over the world and this is the first time I've had such a high price for a record in terrible condition. My guess is that they vet the condition of their rock records more so than their classical.</text><UserId.>112437799294351049740< /UserId.><Rate>2</Rate><GmapID>0x80c29628ef42aa3d:0x6c585b6d9019448<//GmapID>< Pics>

But just scoffed and gave rude remarks. Told me there's a dumpster out back and to be carefull breathing around the vinyls cause of mold. (One record with water damage). Didn't feel good leaving. Would have been fine without the remarks but didnt leave a good taste in my mouth. Dont suggest, one star.

A cool little record store located on Ventura Blvd in Sherman Oaks. They've got a good variety of records and CDs both new and used. If you're in the market for some music to add to your collection, take a look here the next time you go out.< /Text>

<review>The best in LA. No joke. Two people who got their start at the legendary Moby Disc records opened up this store. Their used records, CDs, DVDs and Blu-Ray discs are usually in tip top shape, and they have a good selection of up-to-the-minute vinyl releases. Books and even cassette tapes too!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Got rid of a lot of old vinyl albums, sold them to the store for pennies on the dollars they'll make when they sell them. Just reducing the amount of stuff I'll have to deal with on leaving California. If you've seen "Dog Day Afternoon", all I'll say is that they could have kissed me first (if you get my drift)...< /Text>

A great little store that buys and sells new and used CDs, vinyl, cassettes, DVDs and Blu Rays. The staff are knowledgeable and can usually help you find what you're looking for quickly. It's definitely worth checking out and spending some time perusing the bins in search of hidden treasures.</Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>This is a great store, reminiscent of the many great record stores that used to lie on Ventura BLVD in the '70s and '80s before the internet came wiped them out. Very nice selection of CDs (great condition and very reasonable prices), and LPs.  One can listen to used recordings before buying them.  Highly recommended if you live in the Valley. This store is of a dying breed, take advantage of it while its still around.<//review>< pictures>

ECM rarities ( Joel ) Bowie and Brit new wave ( Rick) and classic rock thru to Blue Note ( Bob) these guys are a font of knowledge. Get Bob on a good day when he has a few minutes and he will entertain you and educate too with encyclopedic knowledge of pressing plants, record labels etc etc too.   The BEST vinyl store in America.

This is the record store where Kristen Scott & Abigail Mac shot some footage for the beginning of video they did together! After they leave the record store let’s just say they eat each other’s 🐱’s! It is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥</Text>

this is a great small record shop i had visited a few times in the past. i like how it's kind of crammed in between the other buildings and doesn't really fit in with the rest of the street buildings around it. the street parking was minimal and it does get pretty crowded but the staff was nice which made up for the walk.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Brilliant. How did the Septikers come to you and then to me. Gaieler DDR punk. Not available in Germany under € 16. And then the scape had arrived after a week. Excellent! Thank you!

I like how the customer service agents (or is it mechanical guru's) always take the time to ask everyone in the store if they need assistance.  I also like how the loan tools out without hesitation. All that and everyone is always friendly! 5 stars, well done.< /Text>

ABOVE AND BEYOND! I got a flat tire while in Vins and popped into the store to ask if they could help. Ulysses said he was unable to assist, and I thanked him. About a minute after I got back to my car, he came up to me a offered an option of asking the oil changing company. Long story short, after an hour of waiting on AAA, Ulysses came back to the car, in the Vins parking lot, and asked if I was ok... He totally went out of his way to make sure I was able to find some help!<//review>

Always friendly and professional, usually have what I need, if not they can normally get it within a reasonable amount of time dependent on what it is. Always clean and orderly. Sign up and get those points plus they offer military discount, win win.<//Text>

<Text>I needed a new car battery for my Lexus.

I had just started a new job and didn't have a lot of extra money.  I went to Auto Zone, Firestone and a couple other part stores.

I decided to check out O'Reilly's Auto Parts.  I spoke with Erlbetero Jimes.  I told him my situation and he told me they did price match.  I  was able to buy a battery I could afford and he also let me borrow tools to change my battery.

Thank Erberto for going above and beyond your job.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

The place is small but has a good selection of fish. The fish look healthy and the price is fair. The staff is friendly but nobody wears a mask in the store, so if someone has a Covid there, cross your fingers.< /Review>

He ordered them for me and his supplier picked a couple of perfect ones for him. They are beautiful and healthy looking. Mike was very helpful and takes great pride in his tanks and stock. All his tanks are clean and his fish all look happy and healthy. He got me exactly what i wanted!</Review><gmapID>0x54d2eca3c54db039:0x9cf178eca06e1e71< /gmapID>< UserId.>

<Review>When I first went to The Deep I was setting up my first planted tank, 6 months later I've got fish, frogs and a lush little environment for them to live in. They were instrumental to the success of my tank. The owner and staff are very helpful and gave me the advice, and got me equipment I needed for my aquarium. Easily the best fresh and saltwater fish place in town.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I usually don't write reviews, but I'm impressed! I came in first to inquire starting a new reef tank. I was completely new and inexperienced. I'm sure I even asked some dumb questions. Without hesitation or annoyance the owner, Mike i think, answered clearly all of them. I'm pretty sure we talked for a half hour or so and I walked out only spending 12$ and gaining a ton of knowledge. I am a business owner and I know that the owners care about the products they are selling and the fish they are caring for. They care about the success of their customers. I'm still only in the first week of starting and already hooked!  My tank is lovely and extremely enjoyable. I wont spend a dollar anywhere else but here.</Text>

Love this store! Owner is super knowledgeable and will take the time to help trouble shoot issues with your tank. He helped my wife and I stop and reverse our reef tank from crashing. I recommend this store over any other in town.< /review>

<text>I think this is the best aquarium store in Redding.   They don't let you make mistakes and lose fish and corals.

<Review>I'm in The Deep on a weekly basis. I won't go to any other stores in town. I've dealt with the rest, now I go to the best. If Mike doesn't have something you want in store, just ask and he can usually get it for you. Very knowledgeable and helpful.< /Review>< Pictures>

Mike is really well informed and will go out of his way to help you and more importantly your tank. If your a reef junkie or looking to get into the hobby, this is the place you need to go.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>During this time the store was very busy. Both owners were attending all customers while multi-tasking. They both try to give all customers their undivided attention. As Mike was passing through to help another customer he had asked me if I had fixed my aquarium stand. And offered his advice.  Conversation took approximately 1 minute while Mike was grabbing a bag for this customers fish.

Also their customer service is some of the best around. Not only are they very attentive to all customers but they take the time to offer advise as well!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

The Deep had a decent selection of fish, I noticed some of the saltwater tanks had red algae, which you wouldn't ever want in your tank (speaking from experience it's not easy to get rid of) and their hours or not very friendly. I'm sure the staff is knowledgeable and they are friendly.</text>

A top rated facility for rehabilitation after surgery.  A great staff, excellent care, and great food. It's  like being at a Resort. The care and services are / phenomenal in all areas. I can't  thank the staff enough for the services and care I received during my stay there after my knee replacement.  May God continue to Bless them all.</review>

Beautiful location however, as a resident I pay too, too much monthly to experience constant staff turnover in critical areas like the dining room and care center and nursing.  Not worth what they are charging me if staffing is not a critical component of customer service.  Constant turnover breeds security issues and mistrust with management.< /review>

<Text>Let me be clear about this. The one star review is for the nursing care or lack there of that we received on the 2nd floor of the rehab facility  I'm sure the retirement facility is as good as the reviews say.
We tried to check our father in the Friday after Thanksgiving. Upon him being received and wheeled into his room we immediately noticed that the room was very hot. Having come from the memorial hospital in La Jolla where the room was set at 71 or lower, this was a concern. I requested a fan for my father or at least be able to bring one for him. The nurse there said they would provide one. We left and headed out to the store to get essentials for him and grab supper and told the head nurse we would return in a couple of hours. Upon arriving back two hours later we found our father walking around in nothing but his briefs. The room was in excess of 85 degrees. His oxygen mask was under the bed, his legs and feet were swollen like redwood trunks. The nurse had not offered or insisted to put on his compression leggings. The nurse assigned specifically to my father made a comment to my father that they could simply stick him with a needle to drain the fluid. The request for a fan to be delivered was denied because they said they were turning on the A/C. The HVAC system was not independent per room and shared as many as 3-4 rooms.  They refused to move him to a cooler room. No vitals had been taken to get a base line number for him. He had not been administered any medication prior to being discharged from La Jolla.  Only after the threat of an official review did three of his meds magically appear. At the end of the day, the doctor on duty phoned in and had my father transferred back to the hospital. We will not ever go back to this facility nor would we recommend anybody to use this faculty, the rehab part that is.</Text>< Pictures>

Our salesperson was Jarood who was very knowledgeable, resourceful and so helpful that what was a difficult sale became a certain sale. We had many considerations - including fabric, color and style, because we were matching a three piece purchase with existing furniture.  Providing us with samples and enormous patience, was exceeded only by the quality of his guidance. Even though Covid has delayed our receipt of the initial order in full, we already have been back to make an additional purchase. Great service, and exquisite quality in furniture.<//Text>

Well designed and quality contemporary furniture in a convenient uncluttered location.  Friendly and helpful staff such as Isreal can make purchases smooth and quick.  Reasonable delivery service and fee.< /Review>

Checked out the site for a new dresser and was really impressed by not only their dresser selection, but their selection across the board for furniture. Wasn't clear about stock for the dresser we selected, so called them directly and everyone was very kind and courteous and excellent about follow-ups. They have a very dedicated team where their goal is to please the client. I asked one of the folks on their sales team to send me photographs of the dresser (as I wanted to make sure the color was accurate) and they had zero issues with doing so. In the end, ordered over the phone and delivery happened in about a week. Delivery was smooth with a 3-hour window ETA. Delivery folks were kind, and it included assembly of the furniture. Overall a very positive experience. A little on the pricey side, but totally worth it as this is top quality furniture and absolutely gorgeous. Highly recommended.</Review>

I ordered a lot of furniture including bedroom set, wall arts, chairs, sofa and bedding sets,...
I like the quality and design. At the day of the delivery some of the items were missing, I contacted the store, Greg, the manager followed up with the missing items. Despite being after hours he stayed in the store to make sure all the items were ordered and shipped correctly. He is a super responsible guy. Her managed everything awesome and I had the missing items the day after. Thank you for your great service Greg. I definitely recommend this place to my friends and will go back for more shopping.</Text>

They're the best here, both in design and customer service. Their showroom is huge, I'm sure you'll be able to find nearly everything you're looking for. I ordered a desk online and they had it ready for me in about 4 days. I think they don't carry many things that you can just walk out with, aside from decorations, so be sure to call ahead of time and see if they have what you need or if they need to place an order for you< /Text>

Beautiful, sturdy furniture that is priced well for the value. Greg is the best - he knows his stuff, very customer centric, reliable and follows through on your requests. Hugo who ruth’s in the warehouse is on top of it. Ready to assemble your furniture for pick up. Highly recommend Scandinavian Designs in Culver City<//text>

This is my "go to" furniture store. They are way nicer than Ikea, Target, and others but without the prices of designer stores. I have bought two media stands and a sectional from them. Sometimes the shipping takes a while but it's worth it!< /review>

We bought the Bolig bed & opted to pick up & assemble ourselves. When we got the headboard out, there was a minor flaw - overspray of another color on two adjoining pieces. They made it super easy to swap out the headboard without having to disassemble the whole bed & exchanged the headboard no problem & made sure we had all the right hardware. It’s a beautiful piece of furniture & we’re happy with it. Great customer service.<//Text>

I had a very good experience shopping here. There was a clear line of sight to all of the store and it made my shopping very streamlined. I saw what I wanted right away. The bonus was the delivery and putting together of my unit. As a matter of fact I’m going again to get a matching piece. The person that helped me was genuine, helpful and knowledgeable. Thanks Scandinavian.</review>

I shopped in this store, when it was Plummers, for 40 years. There's something about the furniture in that store that just works for us. We bought many many pieces. Today we walked in looking for a leather sofa and found one in 10 minutes, and just bought it because it was so beautiful. Great service as well.< /Review>

The most amazing furniture buying experience!  I walked in on a Thursday with a stressful situation.  I needed to buy furniture for my office and have it delivered on the following Wednesday with no idea how that could happen.  Everything I selected was in stock and delivered on time.  The salesperson was so helpful and spent so much time with us making sure everything would go smoothly.  The guys who delivered the furniture were absolute pros and had to remove a door to provide enough space for the couch to fit.  They were Immaculate and cleaned up after installing all the furniture.</Review>

<Review>I went here to buy a matching dresser for my Bolig bed. The showroom is absolutely huge! They are well-quipped for covid with mask signs, hand sanitizer, and the place looked spotless. That put me at ease.  Greg helped me find the set I was looking for and was so friendly and helpful without being overbearing, and I really appreciated his help. I'd park in the lot instead of Venice blvd, I got a ticket for not putting enough time in the meter (my mistake, but easily avoidable!). If something isn't available online, I'd give it a shot and give the storeroom a call or visit to see if they can arrange something.< /Review>< Resp>

<text>The salesperson was friendly, helpful, and gave me a discount I didn't realize I was entitled to. The delivery and assembly of the shelving unit went off perfectly -- on time, done correctly, and no mess. I had already identified the piece I wanted online; I went to the store to see it in person. Since I liked it, I didn't need help looking at anything else, so this was a limited experience.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Everything in this huge store is fun to consider. I worked with Jarrod who knows the store and every piece of furniture like the back of his hand.  Delivery was on time as promised, everything in perfect condition. Delivery team was efficient and friendly - took great care in doing things right. I’m a very pleased customer who will be a repeat customer.< /Review>

<Review>Having had great success with our re-upholstered chair and ottoman, we went back to David for help with two chairs that desperately needed his expertise.  The result, a perfectly blend of craftsmanship and artistry.  The chairs look and feel great.  See attached. Before you sell or give away your valuable furniture, and then pay too much for new furniture, go see David .<//Review>< user_name>

Fantastic store, selection and service!

Could not find wall units, looked at having one custom built.  Everything was boring. Friend suggested the West LA store of Scandinavian Designs.  Walked in, greeted by Israel. He showed us several pieces that would work.  Fell in love with them. Ordered and delivered within the week!  Much better than custom designed, reasonable cost.< /Text>

I CANNOT say enough positive things about Scandinavian Designs.  I just received my second sofa from them (after being COMPLETELY satisfied with my first purchase) and it was EXACTLY what my partner and I needed for our space per our dimensions.  Every aspect of our sofa was customized from the dimensions, to the fabric, to the feet.   DO NOT go to the retail stores and overpay for something unoriginal.  Go to Scandinavian Designs for your next sofa/chair/ottoman/WHATEVER!  You will NOT be disappointed!< /text>

Went in for a sofa, ended up buying a  bed, nightstands, TV console, sofa and chair.  We did this after shopping 5 or 6 other retailers.  The prices are competitive and Finn our salesperson, was excellent.  We await delivery of our custom pieces.< /review>

< review>
This place is really good!
They have very good furniture options for a lot of tastes but obviously does the mod look mostly. My partner and I have been couch shopping for a month now and decided to check this place out based on the reviews of the quality they sell. Once in the store it was awesome. The service was extremely helpful when we needed it and the employees left us alone while we walked around and sat on things. One of the things I hated shopping at other places is the employees following us around answering questions we did not ask and constantly placing themselves in our discussion as we talked with ourselves about our purchase.

The guy that helped us (Greg) was extremely friendly and knowledgeable when we needed him but allowed us to freely explore and discuss.

We get our couch this Friday! I'll post in the next few months but I'm sure we are going to love it! The quality in store was phenomenal< /review>

<Review>Had a wonderful experience at Scandinavian Designs. Huge, bright showroom with great lookin' furniture. Prices/features clearly marked. Very comfortable to walk around at your own pace and not be pestered by salesfolks. Found a truly beautiful chair at a fantastic price. I had shopped extensively so I knew the market, and this one is really well made, very stylish, had a distinct look (not cookie cutter like so many other places), and an extremely reasonable price. Also, delivery is $99. If you haven't noticed yet, all the chain furniture places like Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, etc., are now charging $199-$229 for delivery, even of one item. That is just too outrageous and I won't patronize them as long as that is their policy. So Scandinavian Designs beat them there as well with a more customer friendly policy. Delivery was very easy to schedule and went off without a hitch. Excellent experience.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I needed a bedroom set in a hurry. Scandinavian Designs not only offered excellent customer service in helping me find the best style, they were also able to meet my tight timeline.<//Text>

Have visited the Scandinavian Store in Culver City on Venice Blvd. on three separate occasions.
Each time, staff greeted me and allowed me space to search for merchandise and made sure to answer any questions I had.
My salesperson, Israel, made sure to go over all of the items I decided to purchase, went over the prices including the 10% sales price, and rung it all up.
Delivery is this Wednesday and looking forward to getting all the pieces placed.
Couldn't be happier.<//Text>

Told store I would be coming over the weekend to get a table.  Instead of checking on availability employee told me "sounds great."

When I arrived with my rental truck, I was told for the first time that they do not carry it in stock and it would have to be ordered.  The only unit they had was the floor model.  It had a giant scratch down the center of the glass.

Then they acted like they were doing me a favor by selling me the floor model with all of its damage.  A brand new one was discounted $100 and they tried to play off this discount as a floor model discount.  When I called them out on it, the manager told me that he was doing ME a favor by selling me his damaged model at full price.  Called me "desperate."  Claimed nobody buys furniture and expects to get it right away.

Manager of this store is out of touch with reality and cannot be trusted.</Text>

Had a great experience, good prices all around, this is the place to shop for your furniture. My salesman, Isreal was very sharp and helpful, I highly recommend scandinavian designs in L.A. on Venice bl. After seeing the prices everywhere else, you'll be glad you stopped here</text>

I have used this station since they opened because I like Sinclair gas. But today I pumped gas and the auto shut off for the gas pump did not work. I never left the side of the pump. But the shut off did not work. I went to the attendant to report it, he was not apologetic and tried to blame me for not holding on to the pump handle. There were no paper towel to clean the gas off my car. He told me he could not help me with the spillage, even to provide me with paper towels. I hope he does reports the malfunction. It is not the first time the station is substandard. 80% of time, one can not get a receipt at the pump, there's no towels, and no water for the window cleaning. I was OK with this until today with the poor customer service when there was a fuel pump stop malfunction.</text>

Jorge was amazing with my last minute printing needs! I was able to get my thesis binded and he worked with me figuring out what paper, color, and covers worked the best. He had my 5 copies done in less than 2 hours and I super appreciate that he was able to stay open for me after hours since I'm not from town. He also gave me free gifts! I got some chips, pens, and gum!

I went back the next week to get some last minute graduation cards and they were done in an hour! Super grateful fro Jorge! AND I got gifts again! Very family oriented! Thanks Jorge!< /text>

Wow! Anna Breckenridge saved my life! I was swimming in the Sac river and fell off my boat. Luckily Anna was there to bring me to shore! After I went to Mr. Kopy to print out a resume and Anna helped out again! I can say she saved my life twice and that’s why I’m going Mr. Kopy 5 stars!-< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>George is more than a business owner, he is a compassionate understanding human and I am so grateful we happen to come upon his copy shop. My family was/is in crisis, loss of a dear family member, and we needed copies of our poster asap and we're on a budget. He not only gave us a great deal on beautiful high quality copies of our poster but also gave us extras that were way larger than our original 8x11"...and gave me a candy bar to try and cheer me up when I started crying from his generosity and giving my family encouraging words of hope...words can not express our gratitude, George! Choose Mr. Kopy and support this business, his work is beautiful!< /text>< Pictures>

We love Mr. Kopy! We had a hard time printing the perfect program for our Chico Forensic Conference, but at Mr. Kopy our programs turned out gorgeous! George was so patient as we obsessed over the colors of our program. In the end, we had a beautiful program that looked exactly how we pictured it. Mr. Kopy is quick and provides wonderful service. We will definitely return for all our printing needs.<//Review>

Mr. Kopy is definitely my go-to for personal and business printing projects. George is very kind, helpful, and friendly! The color copies always turn out beautifully, and he consistently adds a few extra copies to whatever job we send. Definitely would recommend anyone to this business- keep it local!< /text>

Mr. Kopy is by far the best place in Chico to get your printing done. They have amazing service and sometimes even better prices than the national chain stores. They treat their customers with respect and will do anything they can to make your printing fast and easy.<//Text>

He offers the cheapest prices, and if you ever find someone who provides a better price, he will certainly price-match it and probably give you an additional discount.

Unlike other copy shops I've had bad experiences with (price- and service-wise), George and his employees will go out of their way to help you out!  If you really need something fast, he will make it happen if he can without charging you a crazy fee for it.

Mr. Kopy is locally owned and not a chain, so it's my pleasure to recommend this business to you!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The team is reliable, friendly and no new business owners of Chico. George, is the one I know. He is very hospitable and reasonable. As far as rates and customer service go in comparison to Fedex/Kinkos, check them out for yourself. I already have. Mr. Kopy returns the profit to the community, large corporations to those that benefactor them. Choose localism.</Text>< Pictures>

Wonderful experience.

I needed to print out a name badge for a Halloween costume.  First I went to FedEx Print center.  I am told to get on a self service computer (at .30 a minute) and bring up the attachment in MS Paint, where I can print it for over $1, but of course it is the wrong size, and I cant figure out how to get it to print in actual size, then I have to figure out how to re-scale the thing and end up pissed off and frustrated and walking out of the place in disgust after spending over $10 without even getting what I wanted yet.

I then went down to Mr. Kopy.

"Oh sure, just email us the attachment, we will scale it, print it, and  laminate it for you"

I come back 30 minutes later, they charge me $4 for exactly what I wanted, that is half the price I paid to FedEx, and I got exactly what I came in wanting.

There is no comparison.  Don't waste your time down at FedEx, just come downtown and these guys will take care of you.< /review>

<text>Excellent place to visit the Sand Dunes, beach, and see beautiful North Coast in Arcata. North trail is super fun, no dogs or horses; south trail allows dogs and horses. South trail has amazing dune ridge trail. Frogs in small ponds.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJ8SljIvBYqDXa0DG5ABMVAQM8mLGawlTabNqm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url':

Every turn, every dune has its own beautiful ecosystem and sensations. The ocean side is  often is foggy while the bayside remains cooler through the day. When you get to the acme of the dunefield it feels as if you're in the middle of a desert. Its a local must see!<//Text>

Had my dog with me and some time to kill while waiting to give a ride to a friend, so thought I'd do some some exploring. Saw the sign and entered a rather unassuming parking lot with no expectations. Both dog and I ended up really enjoying ourselves. Just past the small rectangular lot with parking and concrete picnic tables on one side, a sandy trail snaked through some low brush and through a cut in the small hill to reveal several rows of  20-40' sand  dunes dotted with clusters of brush as far as the eye could see in one direction, and perhaps 3-4 large dunes and valleys between the trailhead and the beach (which I never made it too). Instead I climbed the sliding face of one of the closest tallest dunes (not easy) and rested under a wind-swept tree along it's winding peak. It was a very bizarre sight, one side of this mount was pristine white sand and scrub, but the backside descended into a loamy, shady, forested area, that descended another 40' below the dune's base down to a set of trails that cris-crossed a dry stream bed. Time was up for exploring, but I'll definitely be back, next time allotting more exploration time. Lastly, you might think an area like that with it's many private hidden spots might be populated with transients and littered with trash, but none of either was to be seen. A potential nice place to get away with someone for an afternoon and find a fun spot to relax.</Text>

Have you ever had one of those moments when you taste or smell something, and it instantly takes you back to a moment in your past? My dinner tonight did just that. I ordered the grilled pork and egg roll over vermicelli (Bun). It took my back to a  Ho Chi Mihn City, Vietnam, sitting in a small, street side restaurant with my friend. The flavor was spot on to the Bun I ordered that night. Probably the most authentic flavor I’ve had since being there back in 2016. Glad I found this place. My only complaint is that the portion was a little small for the price. But, if you’re looking for authentic Vietnamese flavor, definitely eat here. You won’t be disappointed.</text>

Good food, if you can get it can them to bring it to your table. They refused to serve us at our table, instead setting it on the one next to us and said county rules wouldn't let them (which sounded strange). Later however, we noticed they would bring the food and drinks to other patron's tables directly that were obviously more regulars. I do not think we will be returning for dine-in.< /Text>

My husband and I ordered the brisket Pho. As you can see in the picture below the meat was all fat or majority fat, which made it unedible. The broth was bland. Very disappointed.</review>

<review>On their site and on google it says they close at 8pm. I get to the restaurant at 6:30 and they were closed. Such a buzz kill. Update your website and google info please. I drove 30 mins because I heard this was the place to be at.</review><gmap_id>0x809b2227483a8d27:0xc86de2a7b94fb0e0</gmap_id><username>Royal Hannosh</username>< Time>

This especially means a lot now to us since my father passed away almost exactly a year ago.  We would dine here as a family often and he thoroughly enjoyed it.   Highly recommend.</text>< pictures>

<review>Soup was good, but I ordered the chicken with shrimp and rice and it was awful. Chicken was one  dry, burnt thin piece with I joke you not 2 pieces of small shrimp. I wasn’t even hungry and I finished it all in like 5 minutes, super disappointing. As a full on meal, don’t go here for anything other than the Pho soup.</review><Rate>2<//Rate>< Date>

The choice of soups is huge, so it will take quite a while to go through the list.  The restaurant is unpretentious, clean, and quiet.  The waiters are always cheerful and helpful.  This is a favorite place to take friends.  Unbelievable value for the quantity and quality of food.< /review>< pictures>

Dont waste your money on banh mi (sandwich). They are very skimpy on the meat and veggies. Definitely not worth the money. Do yourself a favor and make the trip to south sac.</Review>

Yet another place, just another ramen. Nothing bad , nothing good either. Server appears to be having a bad day, sort of passive aggressive service. :D</Review>

The waitress was rather nice to me and commented on my nice trench coat. Like a true gentleman, I tipped m'fedora out of respect and she brought out a complimentary side of spring rolls. So the customer service was outstanding and deserves a 10/10. Now for the food, oh my it was sublime! The hot broth made a sweat trickle down my neckbeard and the steam made my 10 inch framed glasses fog up. Truly, truly, an outrageous experience. 10/10 would eat again.<//Review>< Resp>

I don't like anything fancy or new-fangled; just a traditional steaming bowl of well-made broth, simple rice noodles, a good helping of the appropriate cuts of beef and a plate of fresh herbs and bean sprouts to compliment them.  Hit all these marks, and you've won a permanent place in my heart.  Here's how "Pho Saigon's" house special fared on all of these points:

The Broth- Honestly, the broth was disappointing.  It lacked the depth of spice that is the hallmark of carefully made, good pho broth.  Traditional spices such as star anise and roasted ginger were nearly imperceptible and the resulting liquid was more akin to warm, beefy saltwater.  By no means was it bad or unpalatable, merely disappointing when you've had the truly good stuff before.

The Noodles- Let's face it, it's pretty darn hard to mess up rice noodles.  Save for when they're severely undercooked and still brittle or overcooked and mushy, rice noodles are pretty generically rice noodles.  These were cooked appropriately and, of all the factors I look for in good pho, the only one I have no complaints about.

The Meat- My favorite part of pho is by far and wide the meat.  Thinly sliced cuts of rare beef flank, Vietnamese-style meatballs and an assortment of cuts that are usually seen as undesirable in American cuisine (tripe, tendons and other fatty or cartilaginous bits and pieces) become pure heaven when slowly simmered in a good broth.  The meat at "Pho Saigon" was actually quite good, but the quantity was a major disappointment.  I requested (for an additional $2) extra meat to be put in my soup, but what I was given hardly amounted to what I would receive at my usual pho joints without requesting extra.  This was extremely obvious when I realized that when it came to the Vietnamese meatballs, I had only been given half of one.  Skimp on the noodles if you must, but go cheap on the meat and you've lost me.

The Herb Plate- Pretty much standard to nearly all pho restaurants is the plate of herbs and bean sprouts that accompany your food.  "Pho Saigon" was no different.  This one consisted of a bed of fresh bean sprouts, two slices of raw jalapeno, a branch of none-to-fresh Thai basil that had been harvested far too late and half of a lemon wedge.  Again, they seemed to skimp in one of the key aspects of pho.  Aside from the overly mature basil being more bitter than fragrant, I had expected to have a choice between lemon and lime (and certainly more than half a wedge).

For all of their shortcomings in terms of food quality, the waitress was extremely courteous and provided very good service throughout the entire meal.  The decor was simple and neat and provided a fairly uninteresting but pleasant eating environment.  All in all, "Pho Saigon" was worth the $10 for a large-sized bowl (though I have had better for less), but not the 45-minute drive.  I may or may not return to this restaurant in the future.  It's one of those take it or leave it situations.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>I lived in Hollywood for 20 years and this was probably my favorite restaurant in the area. Not only is the food amazing, but they had two things that were super rare for any restaurant in Hollywood: ample parking, and rarely any kind of wait for a table. Maybe it's because many people don't know about it or don't consider it a place to dine in? Their takeout is also amazing, which is great now during the pandemic, as that's all they're offering. This place is magnificent. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates a good Jewish deli, although they also have great non-deli food (like Thanksgiving dinner every day of the year, and Italian dishes, etc). Even though I don't live in Hollywood any more, I always make a point of going back whenever I can, even though it's over an hour round trip for me to go nowadays. Give this place a shot, you won't regret it.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Ordered 2 pistrami sandwiches. $ 17.95 each!  Must be great-right?  Want special surprise for dinner with my daughter.
Sandwich came and was smaller than what you buy at a 711! Called the manager who acknowledged that the portions were small  stated there was an option to order a larger sandwich at an even higher price but he would give it to me at the original price.
Aside from being a small portion, dry and tasteless, hugely overpriced, why would I ever want to patronize this store again?<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Best wine shop in LA! They have a great selection at really good prices, the staff is always extremely knowledgeable and willing to make suggestions when needed. The food is also really good, the sandwiches are a little on the expensive side, but they are pretty big. My favorite food here is the mac and cheese, though, they bake it in the oven and warm it up when you get it, so it comes perfectly melty and creamy, but also with some parts of gratin cheese, like cooked to the point it becomes a crunchy piece of deliciousness.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bec1edc43193:0xf375f6c919f8109a</gmap_id></record>

< Review>
I have lived in Los Angeles for about 7 years. I moved here from New York. My favorite sandwich is a Reuben, and I’ve never had one that was New York quality since I’ve been in LA. I just ate a pastrami Reuben and matza ball soup from Greenblatts and it is amazing. As good as any sandwich I ate in New York. It’s a little weird that they grill it in a panini press, but I forgive them because it was amazing. I rarely write reviews of anything, good or bad, but this sandwich was worth reviewing. I’ve eaten a Reuben from probably 20-30 restaurants in LA and all of them were forgettable and few passable. Some horrible. Greenblatt’s is the only place you need to go to get a deli sandwich in LA.<//Review>

This place was an authentic Italian find for me in the city! I ordered the mafioso and let me tell you - it was as fresh as it gets. It's a little more than you would typically pay for a sandwich, even in the city, but it's a high quality, fresh ingredients and generous sized sandwich. I purchased this sandwich, headed to Alamo Square and enjoyed my day. Perfect way to start a weekend!</text>

This is one of my VERY FAVORITE restaurants, EVER! The beef brisket is beyond words... but let me try: you wont find a better, more perfectly delicious brisket sandwich anywhere else. Period. I have mine on egg bread with multiple slices of swiss cheese and I dip it into a hot dish of au jus. It is just perfection. I get a side of macaroni salad, again perfection. I wash this down with Dr. Browns root beer or dark cherry soda. Then for a taste of something sweet I have a slice of their magnificent New York cheesecake. I don't care for cheesecake with grahamcracker crust and that is why I love the cheesecake at Greenblatts so much: it has sort of a sugar cookie type crust which is so much more lovely with the velvety cheese filling. It is a tall cheesecake with a generous amount of cheese filling- not too sweet, not too sour. I dream about it often. I have been a Greenblatts customer since 1978 when the first began delivering lunch to my first apartment in West Hollywood. There is a good reason why this famous Jewish deli has thrived for all these years. Everything on their menu is the highest quality available and is as fresh as can be. See for yourself why this restaurant has such an excellent reputation.<//Text>

Can't believe that we've lived in LA for over 20 years and have never been to Greenblatt's. This is by far the best deli we've ever been to. Everything we had was amazing. We ordered  matzo ball soup , grilled pastrami (combo 3), and macaroni salad. Knowing it was our first time here our waiter Fernando brought us potato salad and brisket to sample, they were amazing as well,  but what blew us away was his outstanding service. They've earned new customers for life!<//text>

This is the deli in LA. No one else compares. The pastrami is the best in the city. Matzo ball soup is legit. Great pecan pie. And they have Dr Brown’s Black Cherry soda. Plus Ron Jeremy hangs out here in case you needed to know if Greenblatt’s has street cred.< /text>

This might be a stupid complaint but considering how many delis around Los Angeles I've been to I found this very annoying. My favorite way to judge a deli is by trying a quarter pound of tuna salad and a quarter pound of egg salad and just have a good snack. Unfortunately at Greenblatt's they only do by the pint and 1/2 pint. They couldn't accommodate only wanting a small portion for a single person. So if you're getting dinner for your family, it's the perfect amount but if you only want to snack, go to a different deli.<//review>

<review>Now this is what a Jewish deli looks, feels, and most importantly TASTES like. I had started to worry that LA was misleading it's public on this. The pastrami was delicious, flavorful, and stacked nicely. Should be higher, but...the coleslaw, which ironically is why I came out here, was good...but! It is possible to have more in your Cole slawthan just the cabbage and dressing. Carrots. The missing ingredient you are looking for is carrots. That said, with matzo ball soup like that...you can do anything you want and I will still come back<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2bec1edc43193:0xf375f6c919f8109a< /GmapID></record>

<Text>I've been here many times over the years, and I guess everyone knows about Greenblatt's great wine selection. I'm always struck by the lovely service here.

We love LA and have been many times.  It was the second time when we went on a food tour and was led to Greenblatt's and it's been on our itinerary every LA visit ever since.  We always get the hot pastrami, either in a sandwich or just the meat.  Then typically go for some cheese cake slices.  Even if I was just passing by LA, I'd still go out of my way to make a pit stop here.  Can't recommend enough.</review>

<text>One of my favorite spots in LA! Exceptional selection of wine and the best deli around. Without hesitation I have fought traffic to cross town for a sandwich because Greenblatts is just that damn good. Great spot to dine in at too, it's got a great vibe and a vibe like no other.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>An excellent deli in the heart of West Hollywood. They serve good food at all hours of the day and night. They do also have a deli counter as well. Prices here are a bit higher than some other local delis but they seem fair based on the fact that real estate prices are so high in this neighborhood.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
This was a horrible experience. Very very poor service....slow...inattentive....the explanation was that a big order came in on the phone.
So an order comes in on the phone and all the guest sitting in the restaurant become meaningless....
I hadn't been to this place in years and I don't believe I'll ever go again.
And somebody should teach the kitchen help how to cook turkey properly...he's a hint: It shouldn't be as dry as card board.
This was a waste of time and a waste of money.
Don't bother.....pass.</Review>

The pastrami, as expected, was awesome! But I didn't have the pastrami. I had the corned beef, and it was even better. How do I know about the pastrami? The server brought out a sample of both so I could pick what I liked. I drink a lot of coffee and i thought the coffee was good too.
Cozy atmosphere. Something about this place makes you feel like it's a family joint, which I love, and which it probably is!<//Text>

This is a Los Angeles institution that is worth trying at least once.

Downstairs is a good wine shop and deli; upstairs is a restaurant. It looks nothing like what you would expect from the outside - it definitely feels like stepping back in time (in a good way).

Prices are reasonable, the staff is really friendly and they are open really late.<//text>

The place for a deli fix  in L.A. All the usual corned beef, pastrami, chopped sandwich fillings as well as knishes, matzo ball soup etc. Dinners too. On site parking behind the restsurant. Stairs to the washrooms as well as the upstairs dining area. Small specialty grocery and  take out counter to wet your appetite. Wines, sodas etc.< /Review>

Great wine selection that you can enjoy with your meal.  The pastrami sandwich is the best on the West coast.<//Review>

We were in LA for work, and have always looked forward to going here. The food was delicious, the staff were hospitable. All the legendary things I've ever heard about Greenblatt's were accurate. Will be our first stop the next time we're in town. Muah!!!< /review>

Thought it was good got the #5 pastrami and corned beef with swiss cheese, slaw and Russians dressing on rye. Tried the cheesecake was really good also. Went around midnight so no trouble finding a place to sit. Saw lasagna across the table from me looked and smelled really good. Definitely will come back</Review>

Tonight was the first time here. Food was amazing, service was good. Parking was close, I add a star for this. I was hoping that they would have a better goodie counter, but they have a big wine selection for the drinkers. I’m not a drinker, so I was sad about the pastries I didn’t come home with. Give them a chance, food was top notch.<//text>

Best classic deli in Hollywood. I like to take guests from out of town here and it is my choice for casual dining when in the Hollywood area. There is a rich history and great vibe here. Excellent sandwiches, lox and bagels and Matza ball soup. Their menu includes suggestions for eight things you must eat before you die - I've tried almost all of them and so should you! I usually visit off peak hours so never a wait for service, but there can be wait evenings and weekends. Fantastic selection of wine and deli service for take out. Limited parking in rear of restaurant. Good for groups and desert! Cheesecake is to die for!<//review>

Make sure you get there before 1:15 a.m., however, if you want to be sat. They strictly enforce their no new customers after 1:15 rule even though they are open til 2am. It makes sense - walking into a nice restaurant 10 minutes before they close is rude. Respecting the establishment & it's employees generally garners respect back to you, and provides a better dining experience.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2bec1edc43193:0xf375f6c919f8109a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Had hot pastrami sandwiches to go with potato salad & coleslaw. Place was clean & cozy. Pastrami was average; a little on the dry side. Also, not enough dressing on sandwich. Potato salad & coleslaw were good & fresh.</Review>

<review>I LOVE Greenblatt's!  I have never liked rye bread, however - the first time I went to Greenblatt's - I wanted to have a traditional experience and chose to have corned beef on rye.  Boy, was I surprised!  The rye bread was incredible!  I have been several times and I can't bear to order anything else.  The best is when I go with a group so that I can try multiple selections.  I have not had one bite that wasn't delicious.  Can't wait to go back!<//review>< GmapID>

<review>Historical LA land mark on Sunset Blvd right next to the famous Laugh Factory where celebrities can be seen daily. It's one of the best Jewish deli's in Los Angeles. They have an excellent selection of food, all home quality cooked. My favorite is the turkey club on egg bread or their chicken soup. Excellent service, open 365 days a year everyday till 2 am.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2bec1edc43193:0xf375f6c919f8109a< /Gmap_id>< username>

I love this place. I've been coming here for years. The BEST chicken matzo ball soup on the planet. I'd give them 5 stars, but.. The service is pretty much just ok by the wait staff. I've been a waiter as many of us have, so I "get it", but ya gotta at least pretend like you enjoy what you're doing. Great wine selection - I mean fantastic!!</text>

Thought I saw comedian Tom Papa walking out one evening (there are at least two comedy clubs within walking distance--one right next door) and promised myself I'd check it out next time I was around.  Decent New York, sit-down style deli.  Eavesdropping on conversations at adjacent tables is always entertaining.  Had the pastrami on rye and potato salad.  Both winners.< /review>

<Review>The best you're going to find in L.A. - maybe the world.  The roast beef is amazing.  The potato pancakes are delicious.  The maple chicken is great for dinner at home.  We love the turkey dinner.  The chicken matzo ball soup is superb.  I drive an hour just for a sandwich.  Great prices.  They just need to add egg creams.  Love how the menu lists the ingredients on soda, i.e., cane sugar versus corn syrup.  They even have cucumber soda.  The chocolate mousse is excellent.  Perfect place to go after a show.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Time>1378972218191</Time><rate>4</rate><Review>I love this place. Mostly because of the servers. Emily in particular is one of the nicest and most accommodating servers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. The food is good, especially the tuna melt sandwich and the atmosphere feels very New York to me. The only downside is the lack of background music, given that they sometimes get a full house from the next door Laugh Factory, it can get a bit loud. Also it's somewhat embarrassing to hear so clearly the conversation at the tables next to you (but I come here alone with a book rather often so maybe that's why).

Still, love this place. Go and get the tuna melt and one of their amazing desserts!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Goid deli with meals. I wish they would decrease the 16.00 price for a Rueben then I would go more. They do have a good location. Some of the comedians eat there that perform at the laugh factory.  They have a nice collection of foods and cheese.</Text>

Been eating Greenblatt's for a decade and it is my favorite Los Angeles deli. The service and the prices are the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

Definitely try their reuben, their dark meat turkey platter, the chicken caesar, and their desserts!< /text>

Goid deli with meals. I wish they would decrease the 16.00 price for a Rueben then I would go more. They do have a good location. Some of the comedians eat there that perform at the laugh factory.  They have a nice collection of foods and cheese.</review>

< Review>
This place is horrible! I'm white and I was served like normal but I noticed an Asian couple and a black guy being treated second class!! This is a Jewish place and they should know not to discriminate. I will never go back here from just the BS they call food. I cannot believe my eyes. Never again. On top of the horrible food and cockroaches the bathrooms were dirty and smelled of old urine.

Don't waste your time here!! Notice all the fake reviews giving it a good rating!< /Review>

I cant rate for food, i havent ordered there, i only picked up. But for me the parking in the back was crucial because sunset is not the easiest. The staff were very nice, and the restroom was clean. I saw some cakes that i thought i would go back for to try some other time.< /Text>

<text>This is my favorite deli and maybe restaurant on earth. I have been coming here for over 20years and the place hasn’t changed a single thing. No new design, no new owners or menu. The guys behind the deli counter? Yep most of the same guys for 20+ years still work there. If that doesn’t speak to the kind of place this is. 👀!!GET THIS SANDWICH: toasted LaBrea sourdough, light mayo, lite 1000 island, TURKEY pastrami, baby Swiss cheese, lite onion, (served cold but bread toasted) a great la sandwich thats light ish and won’t totally kill your night game like most other deli all stars can do. #trust🙏🏻🔥<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2bec1edc43193:0xf375f6c919f8109a<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Incredibly disappointed by Greenblatt's Deli.  I've been going here and ordering from the for years and I'm sad to say they've gone downhill.

Today, I placed an order by phone for delivery at 4:20PM and they told me it could be up to 90-minutes, which I was OK with.  I called them after they didn't show up during the delivery time window, and they were completely unapologetic, and accused me of lying about the delivery window.  Luckily they were on speaker when I placed the order and my partner heard. They informed me that the driver left their place at 4PM and had 5 deliveries. By this time, my sandwich would have been sitting around, getting soggy for over an hour, and my soup would have been lukewarm at best. I told them my concern and they didn't care and offered no other options to make me happy, so I cancelled the order.

Just last month, the owner of the shop was talking to me about how they're struggling- and with service like this, I can see why.

I will update my post if they ever reach out to me.</review>

<Review>Always great.  Delicious pastrami and corned beef.  I recommend the reuben here.  It's not greasy like sometimes grilled reuben sandwiches can be...it's just perfect.  And BIG.

Also the chicken noodle and matzo ball soups are outstanding.

Like most delis it isn't super cheap, though.<//Review>< username>

Absolutely the worst service I've ever received living in Los Angeles. I walked into the restaurant to pick up an order for my supervisor. I received no hello, no good morning, no smiles, nothing. However I did receive looks from every single employee. I stood at the deli counter for about 10 minutes requesting help.. Everyone sees me but do not acknowledge me. When I asked for help I was told to wait. A young lady that walked in after me recieved all the smiles and Happy Holidays and the gentleman that came before me as well. Time to check out.. I was disregard as the person that was next the person that came in 15 mins after me was served first to check out although my order was ready because it was called in.. BAD SERVICE!!!!... How little do they know I'm  part of media and I can easily give them a headache. But I will call in to make a complaint..< /text>

Come here for the food, although they have a good wine selection. Easily the best pastrami in the area. I prefer theirs over Langer's.
They use bread from La Brea bakery for their sandwiches. You can also be order their meats by itself from the counter, along with other items.
I love their kreplach soup. I've had their French Dip sandwich and would pass on this, as the au jus was too salty. Their tuna sandwich is delicious and if you like corned beef, they have really good corned beef. Their sides could use some work, but I'm fine with that.</Review>

I've waited for well over an hour for the food and turns out they skipped the ticked in the kitchen. The guy on the counter just said "you wanna wait or you can cancel it", like what? After waiting for an hour, he's telling me to cancel.
If you value your time, choose another place.</text>

Got a corned beef and pastrami grilled reuben and a chicken soup with kreplach.  Both were delicious though I liked the kreplach more than the sandwich.  I would definitely come here for late night deli action over Canter's.< /review>

<review>Now where else can you have an excellent meal with table service, a nice glass of wine and then take home a bottle (or 12) of well selected wines from easy on the pocket book values to a $12,000 vin extraordinaire? Like the servers with their handhelds to take the orders, makes everything run smoothly and efficiently< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>I've waited for well over an hour for the food and turns out they skipped the ticked in the kitchen. The guy on the counter just said "you wanna wait or you can cancel it", like what? After waiting for an hour, he's telling me to cancel.
If you value your time, choose another place.</review>< user_id>

I love this deli's location (next to the Laugh Factory) & its hours.  Reading the book "Save the Deli" by David Sax inspired me to try the pastrami sandwich here w/ a glass of Pinot Noir from Ojai.  The waitress helped me select that particular varietal.  I had half a pastrami sandwich w/ russian dressing, cheese, & cole slaw.  I also had a cup of matzo ball soup.

I found the service to be no-nonsense, fast, & unobtrusive.  I've only tried the pastrami sandwich w/ russian dressing at one other place (Nate n' Al's) & I have to say I prefer it here (although it was a pretty close tie).  The soup was comforting on a (cold for L.A.) day.  The bread was toasted & had the perfect combination of crunch, then soft & chewy bite.  The meat was moist & juicy.  I was very happy with this pleasant meal.

I saw diners for a quick business lunch, an afternoon date, & working lunch over an Apple Mac computer.  So, this place is versatile for all needs & occasions.  I'm planning on coming back to try the other items!</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I loved it, the sandwiches were delicious, especially the pastrami with corned beef, the accompaniment, the potato salad with mustard at the exact point and the first, careful and very warm attention ... it is a place that opens 365 days of the year and has many years in operation, also closes until 2:00 am

Me encantó,  los sándwiches estuvieron RIQUÍSIMOS en especial el de pastrami con corned beef, el acompañamiento, la ensalada de papa con mostaza en el punto exacto y la atención de primera, esmerada y muy cálida... es un sitio que abre los 365 días del año y tiene muchos años en funcionamiento, además cierra hasta las 2:00 a.m.<//Review>< pictures>
