Window tint started bubbling 2 MONTHS after I got my car tinted. Dont waste your money here. The owner won't redo the tint. This is definitely a shady business< /review>

I’ve been coming to Magnuson since 2007.. I have had tint installed on two Camry’s , Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Chrysler 300..., And today I’m installing an upgraded sound system on my 2019 Toyota Tacoma... never had a problem. My family and I don’t go anywhere else.</review>

This place is not worth your time or money. I got my windows done a little over a month ago and now there is little air pockets popping up. I have the warranty so i called to see what i can do and this grown man answers. I tell him about the air pockets and before i can finish my sentence he cuts me off and decides he wants to get loud telling me i need my receipt. Uh ok sir i have my receipt but after your tantrum i will be taking my business to an actual professional. They couldn't get it right the first time so why should i bother the second time especially when dealing with such rude shady people.< /review>

<review>Window tint started to bubble shortly after getting my full car tinted. The owner does not honor the “ lifetime warranty “ they were very unprofessional when I tried to get the bubbled tint redone. This place might be cheap but the work is not good and the shop does not stand by its lifetime warranty.< /review>< Pics>

These dudes right here know their stuff about cars for sure. They have the best deals for tint, audio, glass, and custom work hands down. I was there while they were customizing a sound system on a Chevy lowrider & I was very impressed with their work and style. specially on how they worked to please that customer. Just great vibes when you meet the owner and it's staff. Lancelot is the man if you want to get a great deal and guaranteed work on your vehicle. I highly recommend this place.<//review>

This company doesn't stand by their word and they don't care about the customer. I spoke with the  Manager who said a few months ago if I'm not able to find my receipt that shows a had lifetime warranty to come back and he will give me a discount to redo the work for all of my front windows are peeling. After a couple months and failed to be able to find my receipt I called to schedule and to check on the price with the discount the receptionist who handled the call refuse to even acknowlege the possibility of giving me a discount and said that either they give the current coupon value and that's all that they could give which I found to be acceptable for this is because I am bringing back a vehicle that did not hold up on quality of work to get there not willing to stand by it the woman was very rude not sure she's related to the business owner but if she is not related to the business owner she really represented them horribly as an employee do not go here horrible service<//text>

Got my windows, headlights and taillights  tinted, looked very nice, and came with warranties! I also got a subwoofer installed and better speakers , was pleased with the set up very clean, and has fuses. My speakers did blow out within the first week but they gave me no trouble replacing those with better speakers all under warranty. I loved the lifetime warranty for there suntek tints and the fact that the Audio system has a warranty is great, it is a year. Also front tinting on lights have 5 year warranty. Got the back taillights redone under warranty because rain damage. Honored my warranties with no problem. I had my suspicions but they really came through we’re i needed them too. Will update review after seeing how the new speakers are. But so far pleased with the customer service.</review>

My friend suggested Magnuson Window Tinting & Auto Glass to get a window tint and we came in to get an estimate of how much it would cost for me to get my windows re-tinted. Had an appointment today at 12:00pm. Got the 18% carbon tint on all five windows plus had to remove the old tint. Mr Lancelot Juarez did a great job and he has good customer service as well.</Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>I had auto glass tinting 3 weeks ago. I made an appointment about a week earlier and chose the type of tint we would use. I took my car to their shop and left to have some business done. 2 hours later Mr Juarez called me to say the car is ready. Window tinting was care-free and I am happy with the end result.<//text>< Time>

<Text>I've had a lot of experience with broken windows, I've gone to many different auto glass repair shops. After a car collision the car needed the windshield replaced. After calling insurance, they recommended me to Magnuson Window Tinting & Auto Glass and I scheduled an appointment. They did an excellent job cleaning and did the auto glass installation all in an hour while I grabbed lunch down the street.<//Text><username>Danny Clawson</username>< pics>

It was horrible guy asked me to leave my car over night because he was going to get started on it. So I did because I didn't go to work till the afternoon he said he would call me to give me a status update and he didn't. That regardless my car would b ready before 10am. When it was time for me to go to work I stopped by and they were barely getting started on my car and that was 2:30pm .....I was so mad I even lost time of work and when my car was finally ready he had the nerve to say he don't have to give me a discount but he was anyways...well now theirs bubbles on my windows when I rolled down my windows their was glue inside my door panels that rubbed on my windows it was hard to take off.. and on top of it all they left a mess in my car Lil pieces of tint all over. I'm no happy at all I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!  They did a sloppy ass job. Should of went to LA for the prize I paid lol< /text>

Went in there they tinted my Windows and there was still bubbles weeks later so I went back and they re did them yet again there is still bubbles. Expensive yet their work doesnt speak for the price. Steer clear.< /Text>

This place is pretty good and the prices are reasonable , the cashier are friendly too . I had the O.G ramen and chicken ramen and I left happy and content . I’ve traveled to three states and by far this place hits home . Hopefully they expand their menu .<//text>

I wanted to love this place but it was just ok. Warm and filling, but not 100% delicious. Sorry. Needs more fillings, needs more flavor... needs to be super hot. Ramen is supposed to be super hot. HOWEVER my egg was cooked to perfection, but my husbands was cold inside. Cooked properly, but cold. Will try again soon. The male server was VERY attentive. Outdoor patio was peaceful.</Text>

<review>It's one of those trendy ramen places. The food is outstanding if you're looking for a lower fat/salt way to get your ramen fix but if you're just looking for traditional ramen in America that imitates the kind made in Japan you'll likely be disappointed. There is more to the menu but I haven't tried it myself yet. I'm told it's good though so probably worth a try.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

After checking in to the hotel, we were exauhsted and starving. I found a pamphlet about The Ramen Cafe. Im a ramen freak, so it seemed perfect. Even though the resturaunt closed in 30 minutes, we decided to drive over and try it out. Its the cutest little cafe ever! The staff is friendly and attentive but best of all, the food was delicous! I got the chicken ramen and a pork banh mi. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth didnt taste like it was loaded with sugar like other resturaunts. The banh mi was stuffed with carrots and onions and the pork was tender and delicous. It was the perfect dinner. Thank you Ramen Cafe!< /review>< Pics>

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a very clean place and nice attentive staff. The ramen is very generic and average. Not worth the drive if you’re looking to experience something out of this world. What this spot does offer is good portions, good price, and no lines to get a bowl. The ramen was enjoyable, just really lacked flavor and depth that is in most tonkotsu. If you’re looking for out of this world Ramen it’s Hironori Irvine (5-star)or i20 Ramen (4.5 star) Aliso Viejo.</Text>

We went there tonight hoping to find a great place for Ramen. It was terrible. We were so disappointed. Both my wife and I purchased different Ramen bowels and they both completely lacked any flavor. I am not sure how this place has received so many good reviews.<//Text>

Loved it but of course I would have added more vegies to the delicious soup like shredded carrots and thinly sliced green beans.
My sammie I loved to but would have pickled the vegies for more flavor.< /text>

Went to try the ramen and it was terrific! I had veggie which they added spice for me and it was delicious! My two ramen afficionado companions loved theirs as well. One had OG Ramen and the other had Chicken Ramen. They offered to let us try the ice cream and that was fresh and delicious as well. We'll be back. And they deliver within two miles. Yum!< /text>

I was quite displeased with this place. To Start off anyone going here please note that this place is clearly set up as a delivery or a 'fast food' ramen place. The reason I say this is their staff lack any sense of customer service. We were not greeted, we were not helped to a seat or even menus given to us and while we were sitting the staff did not come to take the order, we had to go up and order and even pour the water ourselves.

The food itself was the most disappointing part. The broth which was luke warm at best was swimming in bean sprouts, so much so that you had to actually look for the noodles. The noodles themselves tasted around the quality of top ramen that had been just soaking longer in broth. The egg that came with the ramen also had been soaking far too long in the broth as it fell apart upon picking it up, these eggs are normally kept cold so I am unsure as to why they were not kept cold here.

They have been open for about a month now so I would figure they would at least have the proper kitchen equipment to make ramen, I did not see any of that equipment however leading me to think that this place was set up without prior knowledge or research into running a resturant or running a ramen shop.

Everyone, do yourself a favor and take the extra time to drive up to Irvine and get some real ramen, this place is more expensive than the well established ramen places up north.</review>

I had OG tonkotsu Ramen.  The tonkotsu soup was amazing and I liked texture of ramen noodle and toppings too.
I didn’t feel like that I need to go on  a diet for a few days after I finished a whole bowl like I usually feel after eating a bowl of ramen at other restaurants.
Bahn mi sandwich is ❤️❤️.  And Chefs and workers are very nice.
We are happy that we don’t have to drive far away to enjoy delicious Ramen.< /Text>

This was such a perfect Children's museum!  It seemed like it might be a little small but with so much to do, we ran out of time and didn't get to do everything.  The staff was excellent.  They were really friendly and great with kids!  We loved all of the different activities and it felt like they had put so much into this museum.  Our favorites were the karaoke and creating the stop action movies.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in Los Angeles!< /text>

Great place for kids birthday. Very well organized. Our family and friends had a blast time for about 2 hours. There are two jumping halls. Kids spent about 40 minutes in each and then lunch. Pizza is overpriced, but this is a private enterprise and they got to make money. They are allowing to bring some extra items for the birthday party: cakes, fruit bowl, vegetable bowls, water.

<text>Great place!!! They have inflatable houses for jumping. 4 of them are for smaller kids. In the second room they have another 4 inflatable houses for bigger kids. Also they have 15 minutes break to play in the dark. Adults can jump too.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuzsSaFPNswcSMoDXX3-rEs0BPp7OHpREeJyCw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Nice place for a birthday. The kids love it and the adults can have fun as well. Remember to being socks! Socks are a must. I liked the glow in dark room the best.</review>

Fantastic place for a birthday party. The staff is so professional and handle every aspect every step of the way. They make it incredibly easy for the parents, while ensuring the kids have a fantastic time. We strongly recommend this place for anyone looking for a place the kids can have an awesome time and the parents can maintain their sanity.< /Review>

Good place for a kids party, ideally for the ones over 3 years old. Nothing very special really, but kids seem to like it. They have a dark room as well with special lights. Parking is available right next to the place.</Review>

Nice place as kids loves it. Apart from party times after 6pm, kids can visit individually between 3pm - 5pm. Not very expensive, but times are restricted. Checking website would help for other ways of visiting (especially design for individual visitors / not a party booking)< /Review>

<Review>Great facility. Poor service.  We celebrated my daughter birthday party.
The facility is nice and kids had a lot of fun. But service was very poor.
The instructors where not around. To organize kids in the group for photo , the birthday cake ceremony was done while all kids are sitting at the table instead of gathered around the cake together .
No one served pizza to the kids or asked if kids want some extra piece.
No one was at the dining room at all , I had to go to the employees room and call them out.
Definitely not stress free party.
The service need to be improved.</Review>< pics>

Well, were positive moments but overall so bad that we won't visit this place again and ideally won't recommend it for any of our close friends. 2 star for the bouncers only that kids love so much and had fun however too short time (((
We've paid really good money for 10 kids with a pack of 25 for $600 + extra that we kinda liked like glow party was really fun, ended $780 sth + we've left around $50 tip hopefully for the helper who was running in between rooms for us.
Kids liked bouncers overall but wanted more that we haven't been allowed due to money making by that place that is on priority in this place. And we actually are ready to pay more to have sth more convenient for us not to be in rush so that many important things have been forgotten at all.
BUT ORGANIZATIONS is really really bad with a conveyer without possibility to go to the party room almost at all. We're the host who has our kid's birthday vision not yours. We need time to prepare everything how we dreamed not how you do for everyone the same! Saturday was really busy with the party right in front of us and right behind us...really packed, no possibility to breath, stop to think and don't forget sth important that was on mind.
So our birthday kid didn't get presents direct from his guests,  we saw them in a huge plastic bag at home only!
They're making so much money but first bouncer in a first room had a hole we felt wind out of it, party room throne is really old - guys really for such big money you make? Please update them! Or poor people who still visit you.
Don't buy photo option at all. Our images made on our phones are much much better. Out of hundreds made images we took 18 maybe still not perfect. Waist of time and money! Just ask one of your relatives take some pics. No pics of whole family, or birthday kid with cake at all, really??? One of the most important moments of the birthday and no one image with cake????
Juice and everything for the table was included into the package we paid but because party was Dinosaur themed we've brought our decoration expected to decorate using ours for kids and using paid included for adults as they are simple and have pump it up logo. We've mentioned that a few times but NOT - they've used everything ours ant theirs even didn't spend at all even juice for kids - JUST OURS! Are you kidding me? We've paid, included in the package and didn't get?????
Glow party is amazing but they give just a few glow decoration so we bought 200 more different including glow balloons that we've mentioned many times as well and again NO WE DIDN'T GET WHAT WE NEEDED. Glow room was poor with a few glow objects and we were spending our and guests time to blow glow balloons for kids....REALLY FRUSTRATED! And this is time we spent instead of enjoying our son's birthday!
THINK TWICE BEFORE SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY HERE! Unfortunately we didn't find a better place that would be not so far by that time! And we didn't expect it will be so bad at all!</review>

This is a fun place for little kids, but needs a greater variety of things for them to do other than different blow up bounce houses.</Text>

<text>Beware of this place!  The owner (I think Montaq is his name) is rude and pressure guests to sign forms right away and don't give you time to read the contents.  Totally has no clue about professionalism and good customer service.  I don't recommend going to this place.</text></record>

<text>It's a factory and your party is treated like a number. The pictures that the staff takes as they walk through the party are awful. And they expoect you to tip 20% at the end for the lackadaisical staff.< /text>< Pics>

Be careful of this place over priced people that work here r nice but the owner is so rude and don't explain to you that you are not allowed in the eating area until late the last 40 mins of your party they make you sign the contract then tell you it's like he'll specially if you have grandparents coming or any elders remember they,have to wait almost 2 hours to seat or eat and it's very overpriced to expensive not worth it i think next I will go chuck e cheese it's cheaper and better and kids at any age have more fun make sure if you book a party have it in writing or else when you get there they deni everything and show you the real price but then you don't have a choice because guests are coming and you paid for everything be aware! !!!!!!!! Stay as far as you can from this place. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste money here and also middle of your eating they tell you that you have to leave Cuz they,have the next party coming they literally kicked you out and with my experience kids play and eat so alot of my guests were hungry because of the timing i  had to feed alot my guest outside very very bad place especially that owner he has no idea of business even the employee's complain about him but one person said she had no choice she needed a job .</text>

<Text>This place is Amazing. The experience with Eric was world class. He took the time to print out several reports and went through them diligently. This fellow is super business friendly with high emotional intelligence. Please consider this store as your one and only stop and work with Eric, world class professional.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Came here 2 days ago and yesterday. Yesterday we happened to meet manager serve for us. We spent an hour to solve the problem for cellular signal problem in iPhone 7, upgrade our WiFi for cheaper price and add benefit to our AT&T data share plan. We also had a chance to try out new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 pro and let me decide it’s not worth it. It takes us an hour but it is a nice experience!<//review>< UserId.>

< Review>
Karla at the Pasadena store was the perfect sales person. Her communication skills, people skills, and over all knowledge of what she was selling was above par. She's a young lady that should be managing and running her own store. AT&T could never loose with a sales person like her on their team.< /Review>

***BUYER BEWARE*** Shop here at your own risk. I do not normally call people straight up scammers but that is what we have here. My misfortune begins when I was scared into believing I needed a screen protector. The sales girl hastily put it on and when I pointed it out she tried to reassure me that it would be under warrant. Well within two weeks bubbles began to form. I returned to the store and asked them to fix the problem they caused. They told me to go to some other store boutique miles away. Major inconvenience and very poor customer service.< /review>

I was helped out by Karla yesterday and she was so great! She was very patient with me while I worked through some unexpected difficulties and helped me upgrade my phone. I had previously been to different AT&T’s a couple times where I was unable to be helped for reasons that were unclear to me but Karla made my experience yesterday wonderful! She was very personable and nice and I was able to leave with a new phone 😄 Jeep gang.< /text>

Alex is the new store manager, he is making good changes and he has a goal to make the customer experience better.  He is willing to take care of business.  I would give it a 2nd chance.</Review>

<review>Unhelpful and rude associates.  Waited over an hour for help (which I understand as they were busy) and the associate refused to help me correct an error they made.  Went to another location and received much better service. Pick another store this one is awful.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>Earlier this year, my work life balance was non existent so I decided to get a separate phone for work. I’ve been disappointed by other providers in the past so decided to give AT&T a try.

Working from home can get pretty monotonous so I was honestly pretty excited for an outing to the Pasadena store. Right when I walked in, I noticed the staff here really goes above and beyond to make customers not only feel helped but also feel safe amidst the current situation.

A really sweet girl helped me browse around the models and I was able to ask the manager, Colin, my 99+ questions about starting a new account for work. Overall, the process was super easy and I especially loved shopping through their HUGE variety of phone cases and Pop Sockets!

Ladies, they have very aesthetic pop sockets here with embedded daises and sunflowers (!!) which i’ve never seen elsewhere. I’ve been telling my friends from all over LA to make their way to the Pasadena store because the staff is SO helpful here and not rude or distant like other brand’s phone stores.  Thanks so much guys and I can’t wait to come back in a few weeks for another aesthetic phone case! ☺️☺️☺️<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1614372265380, 'text': 'Hi!

This AT&T store is bar none the best experience I’ve had when it comes to customer service. Ken was very patient and his manager Colin went above and beyond fixing a situation that started with a salesmen that had come to my home. I was ready to go back to T-Mobile but I have to say this store alone makes me feel about switching my home and cell services.<//Review>

Xochitl was so helpful and patient with me and my aunt. Thank you so much! It really means a lot that you took the time to explain everything because she is Deaf/Hard of Hearing and taking the extra time with us to make sure she understands everything is priceless. Jess  was also very helpful I’m picking the best solution. We will definitely return to this store in the future.</Review>

Worst at&t branch ever! Bought 6 Lines with IPhones about a year ago from that store, the staff was kind of in a hurry so the put all of my information wrong, still suffering with customer service every week until this moment to fix what they did! Even when I went there to complain they said “ It’s not our responsibility anymore, call customer service” !! The store manager always grumpy and has the worst attitude ever.<//Text>

Tim took good care of my mother and I when it came down to upgrading. Was patient and very detailed when explaining the plan,phone,account, and etc. we had a small obstacle but Tim handled it like a champ and made sure everything was clear. Awesome customer service and very smart! Definitely a great and amazing sales rep! Thank you Tim!</Review>

Came yesterday to get a new iPhone and asked Ruby if I could exchange a brand new, never opened phone case that I had gotten from this same store on December 9. Ruby printed the receipt out for me yesterday and said that there was no problem. I came today and Nelson was the guy there who "tried to help" . I told him what Ruby had told me and he said that he couldn't do the exchange despite of the other employee telling me it was ok to do so. Will never come back to this at&t location. Ruby was great, but Nelson has horrible customer service and an attitude.
My previous review is down below. Went from 5 to 1 star thanks to Nelson and the horrible customer service
12/9/20:
Walked in and were greeted right away. Ruby helped my sister get her new plans and helped us lower our monthly bill! We received the beat customer service. Will be coming back to this location! Thank you Ruby 😊😊</review>

I walked out with such an great experience that I am 100% sure I won’t switch providers ever! Ruby Is an example of what customer service should feel like. Definitely coming back to her in the future if anything arises. She needs to be a store manager ASAP!< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate><UserId.>115467961440749731339<//UserId.></record>

<Review>After struggling to find a rep that was consistent and helpful for my business needs I started working with Erick G about 5 years ago.  He’s helped educate me on my options, and also has been clear with my best pricing options.  I highly recommend Erick and the team.< /Review>< user>

The AT&T staff at this location is very friendly and helpful. The nearby secure parking is $8.00 and is not validated by AT&T, as it should. General shopping and food is very near and fun. The AT&T store selection of phones to view and buy is limited.<//Text>

Super thankful she was patient & kind to show me step by step. Overall happy with her assistance .<//review>< pictures>

Moreover, I usually  congratulate those who are capable to strive for excellence in taking care of customers and I have never seen anyone at att giving me and the level of customers service like this gentleman, as well as to others while I was at the store.

Had a really wonderful experience. Both the manager and associate were easy to work with and did a professional job getting the options and services that served my needs. Went in expecting to have a typical “sales” experience. It was anything but. I walked out with a new phone and paying less per month then when I walked in. I would drive back to Pasadena from Santa Monica again to experience this service.</Text>

I was hesitant to go to the store during a pandemic, but needed help with my phone as it is essential for me to work from home. Staff was very helpful and professional. They managed to help me with my connectivity issues and I was impressed with their serious consideration for my safety and felt comfortable throughout my visit at the store. Thank you AT&T for making our health and safety and that of your employees a priority. And thank you to the staff at this store for enforcing mask-wearing and social distancing protocols during these scary times.< /Review>

I had my iPhone 11 stolen at a gas station earlier in the week. Youssef helped us lower our phone bill and get a new iPhone 11 for half the price. So happy to have come to this AT&T store. If you’re trying to figure out which store to come to you should come to this one.<//text>

After making us wait for more than 2.5 hours, which most was blamed on "slow systems" by Priscila R., we walked out, only to realize 20 minutes later that she ordered the wrong phone in wrong color.  Called back to ask them to switch out to the correct phone and correct color.  Was told they can't do anything over the phone and that I should come back to the store.  I asked to speak with a manager, since I thought that would be odd considering it's COVID peak time and I have a pregnant wife with me as well, and I already spent 2.5 hours there for an error THEY made, not me.  I was told by the same employee that he checked with the manager and answer remains the same.  He refused to give his name or let me speak with a manager.  Only other option given was to cancel the order, which was the option I was forced to go with.

3 hour wait time at Apple store is the MUCH better option, avoid going to this store at all cost.< /Text><response>{'time': 1606936373879, 'text': 'Hello Leo J.

<Review>After a small problem my experience here ended up pretty well. I had a small miscommunication with an employee and received the wrong phone. Manager Colin immediately contacted me about my situation and with out hesitation made sure he fixed the problem right away and make sure I got what I wanted. Employee Nelson made sure everything after that went smooth and fixed any problems after that. Again thank you Manager Colins!

They also have a very well safe set up for covid 19 for all those worried. I felt comfortable going in with out worrying about my surroundings. Great place!<//Review>< Pics>

I really didn’t want to take time to write a negative review, but feel that it is most appropriate for the level of service received at this location.
Back in May we visited this store wanting a consultation on the best ways to upgrade. After almost 2hrs the sales associate walked us through options and told us we were eligible and started closing the order; only to discover we weren’t eligible without fees. The manager at the time apologized and mentioned it was a total oversight. We left the store highly disappointed for the time spent receiving inaccurate information.
We decided to come back in July as we were contemplating switching providers. I asked to talk to the store manager and Colin came to assist us. He apologized for out last experience, informed us that there was no need to switch providers, and assisted us with a few options. It was near closing and he advised me that he would contact me over the weekend to give me detailed pricing of our options. He texted me so I would have his number, but to my surprise we never heard back from him.
So decided we tried again! We came back to the store last night 11/6 and worked with Youseff. He’s a great guy and did well. We ran into a few pricing questions and requested a manager to assist to provide further clarity. He went to the back about 3 times during the course of the night. He explained Colin had just left and didn’t prefer to be contacted after hours—understandable. Another manager recently end her shift as well. And the other manager was busy preparing to close. I then asked if again if we could briefly speak to this manager before completing the upgrade...he apologized and said that the manager was unavailable. We left the store and decided not to upgrade with this lack of professionalism from management. Yousef advised us that he would contact us in the morning once talking to Colin; we never heard back from anyone.
I texted the number from Colin just to inform him that of my experience and to mention that I never heard back from him; no response. I then mentioned I would be filing a complaint with a “real corporate store” and was willing to share my experience with the general public via a public review.
Overall, these experiences were totally unprofessional, disrespectful, with a lack of customer care/service. I’ll never be back to this location and suggest a change in senior management, starting with Colin.  The leadership is terrible and shows in the unknowledgeable sales team.</review>

I recently switched over from MetroPCS to AT&T for all of our wireless Internet and television. I can’t say enough about the excellent excellent customer service that I received from Nelson and Edward, the manager, at the Pasadena store in old town. There were several complicating factors in transferring our lines, they were extremely patient answering all of my questions and making it possible for us to become new customers. I am in emergency room nurse with a very high expectations with regards to customer service and I can honestly say that I haven’t received this type of service in any retail storeIn the last few years. This is the type of service that I expect but sadly often do not receive, the store is really doing it right highly recommend coming in and switching to AT&T. Thank you so much Nelson Edward and also Xochil who helped us on one of the days!<//review>

Nelson was amazing! He was communicative and informative and very friendly. He laid out all my options and made good recommendations. We’ll definitely come and see him for any future ATT needs.

UPDATE: I should have remembered the adage, "If it's too good to be true, it probably is," because the great deal I got was not fully explained to me and when I got my ATT bill, I realized that I'd been duped. I had to undo what was done at the store, and now will have to pay off my phone in full rather than installments. Grrrrr.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>During this crazy time I really needed to get some things moved around my plan. I was fortunate enough to work with Isabel , she was fast and efficient and such a sweet heart. I think retail workers at times forget that we don’t understand the lingo. But with that being said she explained to me a couple options, and her manger Edward popped in to make sure things would make sense for us. I recently opened a small business and although I didn’t expect on taking anything home as an upgrade I ended up leaving with an iPad that made my ecommerce business a lot easier.

<Review>Went to the AT&T store this afternoon after my eSim on my phone just stopped working.  Because of COVID I was trying to avoid having to go to the store in person by calling tech support to have them resolve my issue. After 3 days of getting absolutely no where with the online support I finally caved and made an appointment to this AT&T store. To be honest my previsto experience here was quite unpleasant, so much so that I was trying to avoid this particular location. But after calling around I was told that if I needed a replacement eSim I would have to come to this location. I arrived 30 minutes early for my appointment, but Ken who greeted me said it was not a problem. I explained the issue I was having and he quickly went to get a manager to help. Ken quickly briefed the manager (sadly, I didn’t get his name) and within minutes assessed that I needed a new eSim card. Both gentlemen were very knowledgeable & efficient and got my phone up and running shortly after.  I was in and out of the store in about 20 minutes. If you’ve avoided this store due to poor experience in the past (like I have) please, please give this location another chance, I am so glad that I did! Thank you Ken and Manager for resolving my issue so quickly!  I am so thankful to have my phone up and running again!!< /Review>< pics>

Youssef was incredibly polite as he explained the method of payment during Covid-19. (This is my first bill & I was going to pay by check.)

The customer service he gave me is the reason I brought all my accounts to AT&T.

<Text>I visited the AT&T store and was immediately assisted by Xochitil Damasco. I came in a bad mood and was in a hurry and frustrated and Xochitil was so patient and helpful and made sure I was getting the best deal possible and was so kind despite my grumpiness which she didn't deserve. She assisted me throughout the process of switching to a new phone and stayed with me till it was fully complete. I highly recommend Xochitil and her team. Thank you!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I purchased an iPad here and added it to my plan. The sales rep duplicated the I pad on my bill and now it shows that I purchased multiple iPads. I’ve spend over 20 hours trying to fix this and still no one can help because the iPads are non existent.

Purchase anything from this location with caution.<//Review><Time>1604266938804<//Time>< userid>

Liars.
Don’t know who the salesman was but when my fiancée was adding her account to mine the salesperson signed us up for insurance on both our phones though this was not asked for or told to us in any way. I suggest you record your visit their for legal purposes as their is always the possibility you are being lied to or defrauded, as was done to us. Also when my fiancée tried to cancel it the first time they just kept it going. Gonna switch ASAP.< /Review>

I went in to start a new phone plan and was told that my payment would be $75 all in with taxes and fees. I knew something was up when the representative was shaking and giving numbers on a post-it note. it was like a used car dealership from the 1980's. They didn't want to give me my details in writing and I had to insist. Well guess what, the bill is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than they told me it would be with tons of fees. STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE!</Review>< Pictures>

Last Thursday I went to this AT&T location to get a new phone. I was instantly greeted by Isabel and told her what my needs were ( e.g. a new Iphone) and she took me over to the table to get the details. She quickly got the phone, asked me how I was going to use the phone and processed payment. She had such a good energy, patience and was super cool with the fact that I wasn't super tech savy ( when time to set up the phone). The whole process was no less than 45 minutes from the time I walked in to the time I left. I went home and thought I could do it myself, but ended up back at the store. Thank God for Isabel's help and her still being there. She walked me through the process step by step and answered any additional questions I may have had about the phone. I would've been sooo frustrated and lost had I not gone back and gotten her help. Super grateful to her and the other Team members who were in the store.< /Text>

I highly recommend the Pasadena at&t location. Xochitl is a superstar!!! I am a new AT&T customer (switching from t mobile) there were major problems in how my new account was set up with an att&t phone representative. Xóchitl spent HOURS fixing the numerous issues. I can't thank her enough.</Review>

<text>I put off rating this AT&T store hoping they eventually get my order corrected and resolve my issue after visiting 4 time since March when I bought my brand new Galaxy s10+ from them with AT&T service.
And still waiting for Robert Lara "the store manager" to call me back after 3 messages I left at the store and his business cell phone. He deserve the worst manager of the year award from AT&T. Wake up AT&T and Get rid of this guy if you value your customers.
What are my issues? False advertising to start with. I end up paying 40% more than T-Mobile with no improvement and tons of restrictions on my unlimited account. No free Mobile Hotspot or Tethering. You have to pay extra for what suppose to be part of your cell phone function. They also charge for caller screening and blocking. Which is easy to get around.
Do yourself a favor and get everything they promise you in writing and avoid Pasadena store it is badly run by the manager.< /text>< Resp>

No stars isn’t an option otherwise I’d give a Zero star. this place is absolute horrible experience. Every time I go there the employees are unpleasant and rude! They don’t care about clearing up issues just selling you new contracts. If you can help it don’t go there!<//Text>

I only have to go to the AT&T store once every year or two and I dread it every time. Seriously if I could pay someone to do this for me I would. I've never had a good experience here and my most recent time was no exception.

I won't bore you with the details but let's just say it took me an hour to get a phone upgrade. It was clear that the employees hated working there and none of them cared about customer service or lack thereof.<//Text>

I was greeted and helped immediately upon entry. Visit took no more than 10 minutes, I just needed a replacement SIM card as I had lost my phone. The rep in store wanted to upsell me and asked if I would like to add a line. I declined and that was over. She came back with my sim card and i was on my way. But later on I received an email saying a new phone line was added to my plan and my bill shot to over $200. I was very unhappy about that. Now I have to waste time contacting customer service try and resolve the situation.

< review>
I ordered internet Wi-Fi from AT&T and booked an installation date for Saturday, September 21st from 09 AM to 11 AM. When the installation person arrived in my flat, he communicated a mistake, reported to be happening 'quite often' with AT&T, regarding the nature of my account being set as 'business', even though I applied for internet service to my residence. Therefore he strongly suggested that I regularized my status from 'business' to 'residential' before going further with the installation process. As suggested, I used my Saturday afternoon to go back to the same AT&T store in old town Pasadena, CA, to verify what happened. Upon arrival, I was informed that in order to avoid me paying the installation fee they set my account to business and that it was a normal procedure. However, if it is a normal procedure, why did not the installation person know about it? Why do I have to wait another 5 days until the installation happens? They only have an available time on next Wednesday. AT&T plays with its costumers in order to catch them for whatever price, but they forget to communicate these same tricks to their field personnel. I am utterly shocked by the lack of professionalism and respect towards their clients. It is absurd.<//review>

<text>I had purchased my 4s from Sam's club, and went to the AT&T store to get my contacts transferred.  Judah was great!  He got my contacts transferred from my old blackberry in a few minutes.  My calendar was not working, and he took me to the genius bar, and a technician there fixed it in a few minutes.  Overall,my experience with this store is excellent.<//text>< user_name>

Went in to get my phone fixed, right off the bat my experience was awesome. Mya greeted me right away and actually made me feel welcomed. I'm never sure what I'm doing in a cell phone store, so many plans, phones and prices...Mya was kind enough to break it down for me, helped set up my new phone and got me some impressive cases. THANKS! definitely coming back for my kids!</Text>

I lost my phone so I tried to activate a sim card for my replacement here earlier. I didn't have my id with me so I was told by an associate to do it on the phone.  I explained I tried calling at the Apple store down the street 5 minutes prior but since AT&T's customer service line only operates from 5am-7pm pst. and it was after 7pm I was advised by Apple to try here... He figured it was worth a shot to call again from the store since he knew he could get on the line with someone... Not a good idea. I waited patiently for 10 minutes before he hands me the phone and says "if you need me I'll be up front." I was on the phone 26:16!! I was transferred to two operators from AT&T answering the same questions to each before the second operator explains he can't help me since I'm calling from an AT&T store & an associate at the store should be able to do it quickly... The whole time I was on hold in the store no one asked how I was doing or if I needed anything, a water would have been amazing... I wasted 35 minutes of my day watching a store full of workers do nothing while a beats pill demo station played generic EDM hits. The painfully awkward small talk & hearing AT&T hold advertisements over and over didn't lighten the vibe at all either. When I finally hung up the phone no one from the staff acknowledged me even though it was on their phone awkwardly out of place for 15%-30% of their shift. Way I see it if you pay your employees to stand around on their smart phones wasting time while I do their job then why aren't I getting a check?? Know your policy and stick by it.. I'm sure the associate was just trying to "hook me up" or something by calling customer service after it was closed but he knew all along I needed an ID.</text>

Well it all started when they talked me into getting Direct TV. First they signed me up with the wrong package paying much more than I was quoted. When I went back to fix this problem they told me that the girl who was helping me had been fired. Spent 4 hours in the store, majority of the time on the phone with customer service. Then had to go back and have my direct tv and internet bills bundled which took two months. Recently went in the store, waited about an hour to be helped because everyone was on their lunch break. Finally when I was assisted by the Team Lead Bryan Zaragoza (very rude) he told me how sorry he was for me having to wait so long and that he would credit my account $25. When I asked when I would see this credit on my account he said that he didn't have time and promised that he would do it by the end of the day. Just received next months bill and still have not received the credit. Been calling him and e-mailing for weeks and no response. When he gave me his card he said if I had any problems to contact him. Worst customer service ever.</Text>

Horrifying. Avoid it. Useless, condescending sales people-well, the girl with the straight black hair, who "greeted" me, on 12/29/2014, at about 6 PM, while the guy was washing the windows??? I was so shocked by her, I couldn't get past the door, and I've been an ATT customer for eons. HEY ATT, GET A CLUE: THE CUSTOMERS ARE YOUR PAYCHECK. I'd give it ZERO stars if I could, for that snarky horrible woman there: AND: forget trying to get online help-it isn't going to happen.SWITCHING CARRIERS. NOW.</text>

<review>This is the worst cell office experience that I have had.  That really says a lot given the industry standards, however, the staff gave false promises, misrepresentation and run around a new meaning.  I hope that I can get out of the deals that I signed given the horrible customer service of  AT&T.  When I tried to call the office no one answered the phone and I was on hold for an hour at the 800 number before they hung up.  Please spare yourself the aggravation and stay away.</review><rating>1<//rating></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Worst customer service ever from AT&T. It all started on June when I stop to Pasadena store to get my daughter a new iPhone SE for her graduation. Mari Cruz a sales associate help me with the process in which I was informed that I could get unlimited data if I switch my tv provider to DIRECTV which it sounded good specially having a teen with a phone. Through the process Mari Cruz informed me that she had talk to the manger for a promotion and that I qualified for a instore credit of $200 dollars that had to be used at that moment which I was a little hesitant about it but she convince me to take advantage of the offer and all I had to do was wait for a Visa card to pay the instore credit so I did. It was late November and still no Visa card and I had made payments on the instore credit items. I called the store and asked to speak to Mari Cruz which she was off so I spoke to Juan a store manager. I explain to him the situation since the begging at which his respond was "I need to talk to her and I'll give a call by Thursday" we were on Monday. So Thursday came then Friday so I contacted Juan on Monday 4 days after his promised to which he replied that he had no news and was waiting for DIRECTV to contact him. So I waited again one more week still no phone call from Juan so I called again and he responded "oh I forgot to call you but the Visa card is been mail to you" no apology no other explanation about the issues from the lack of service and attention from Mari Cruz  and him. So the Visa card came in and guess what no $200 just $100 so I was upset so I called Juan AGAIN so I asked him why was I only getting half of what was promised to me so his respond was "oh wait it was $200 I taught it was only $100" so this means he didn't pay attention to my problem (lack of service) my reply was "wait you told me that you spoke to Mari Cruz and that you were aware of the situation" JUAN'S respond was "oh she has been back since she took days off back in November (fishy and dishonest). So I drove to store to finally put a face to JUAN. I arrive to the store with my daughter and it took JUAN more than an hour to finally fix the problem they had made and all this time my daughter was in need of a bathroom so I had her suffer for an hour why because JUAN didn't do his job since the begging. The whole process in the store no apology no explanations no customer service basically I felt like I was bothering them with my problem. JUAN and the other managers in the store are the worst at proving good customer experience (and yes I am talking to you; the woman manger next to Juan on that day  THANK YOU for not helping and making me fell that I was bothering you in your work day with my questions). So my advice stay away from this store and if you must visit stay away from JUAN and MARI CRUZ you WILL HAVE A NIGHTMARE with their help. AT&T THANK YOU FOR THE WORST SERVICE I have ever been provided in our 18 years of partnership. Your lucky I need a good service provider and by service I don't mean your mangers and sales associates I mean the wireless service otherwise I would switching to VERIZON.< /review>

I've been on the phone with customer service no less than 10 hours and have made 2 visits to the store lasting 2 hours each! I'm not a happy camper with #attbundledservices I finally got a decent customer service representative that took 3 hours on the phone yesterday to straighten everything out for me and I will still need to go to the store one more time to get iPhones swapped out! #ugh<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>A great experience.  First of all, I had a terrible experience at the att in Arcadia mall just 2 days prior which left me without any cellular data access for 2 days.  I arrived to the Colorado att at 5 minutes before closing and was worried that I'd be turned away and would have to go for another day without Internet access.  But no problem. They whisked me in and took care of the problem that the att store in Arcadia mall did to my phone and then tested it to be sure that it worked. (When I asked the guy in arcadia to test it to make sure that it worked, he did not want to. Now I know why...because it didn't).

Definitely always go to an att corporate store rather than a 3rd party owned att store.< /review><Rating>5< /Rating><response>{'time': 1443653307049, 'text': 'Hi Melanie!

This is the worst experience I've had with AT&T for 25 years, The manager Anna hid in the back, they made me wait for 20 min to tell me they don't have a booster, they were lying, I have never been treated so badly. This Anna has an attitude she was doing me a favor. ATT should do something about this store. I will write to ATT and their board and CEO concerning this awful experience<//Review>

Best fried chicken I’ve had in a while. Biscuits are soft, buttery and sweet. Chicken delicious with a spicy buttermilk batter. Amazing< /text>

Good food, it's a small place standing only, they cooked my order as requested. It was tasty and crispy, it's really what I was looking for. The area is industrial looking but their's great food spots in this area. This is a small business so they will try and get you to take what they've fried; tell them what you want, be patient, get food and enjoy. No complaints.< /review>

Everyone raves about this place. Why? I have no idea. The chicken was very fatty and didn't have much taste. It was similar to KFC. Popeyes is way better.<//text>

Staff is nice has everything on menu unlike some other KKCs I've been to. But we found ants in the batter of the chicken . At first I thought my lady was joking but upon closer look there was whole ants fried into our chicken. It was terrible we ate most of our meal before any of us noticed. Needless to say I won't be back and health inspector needs to go check that spot out asap!<//review>

Good chicken at a fair price. Beats KFC hands down and gives Popeyes a run for their money.</Text>

<Review>I like their chicken and love the biscuits. This is a chain, like KFC, but the chicken is moister and their specials good. It's good to support a local business.

The honey Butter biscuits alone are worth coming here to get. Add in the chicken and thats a meal.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Taste ok. Don't like that the chicken is pre cooked in mass quantity and sits under a heat lamp for who knows how long. Pretty high priced unless you get a deal and even then no drink so not quite a deal. Better than the Pinole location though so that's a plus.<//Review>

My family stops here for quick dinners. I haven't tried the burgers or seafood. Althought, I've been told everything seafood is frozen before heating up.
The chicken is always ready to go, but if you plan on making a large order, they prefer you to call ahead of time as a courtesy.
There's also a small seating area in the front to eat if you're not in a hurry. The seating isn't comfortable, but it's better than standing or walking while you eat.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Good deals and fresh food. Their biscuits are tasty and so are their chicken strips. Will definitely eat there again. I haven't tried the fried chicken yet, but I will sometime soon. The jambalaya and mashed potatoes are also quite tasty. The food is fresh and service is friendly.<//Text>

The new ownership has made some nice changes at this location. If Krispy krunchy Chicken is a chain then this one is off the chain! They've added breakfast items, homemade salads, some delicious biscuits and much more. Come check out the family atmosphere and a little bit of Jamaica!</review>

I have no idea why most of the reviewer gave this store location a good review where in fact was not on my case...The guy (bearded and with heavy accent) are so RUDE, asking the customer to close the door on a tone that as if he's asking his maid to do it for him, when asked back to say please...he yell at the customer and he order refund of the payment...definitely not a good experience for me...i'll never go back to that stinky store again< /Review>

This location of Sweet Veggie has converted their seating to a small market and has switched to takeout. The bento boxes are a great deal! $7.99 for rice or noodles with 4 items. The food rotates everyday and is always interesting. People seem to love the market too. It can be a bit cramped when busy because it is small, but don't let that put you off. Make clear you want take out, order and enjoy!
(There are two tables outside, two chairs each)<//Review>

<review>This is an awesome place that sells Taiwanese Vegetarian food! I used to come her before the COVID 19 pandemic and I can say it looks a lot different. You used to be able to come in, get your own different food they have as well as shaved ice and get drinks like winter melon tea, but now it is made for Togo only. You can’t still order food, but it would be more of a set meal, like a bento box, and they have transformed the whole “dining” area into a small Taiwanese market!
You can go in here now, pick up some rice, snacks, or some vegetables, while also getting a meal before you check out, and its great! Not only do they sell different things, but they also try to stay close to the type of restaurant they have, so they would have things like vegan jerky, etc. My last trip, I was able to buy different groceries and then was able to get 2 meals for under $9 each, that included a bento box, winter melon tea, pudding (like the ones they have in Taiwan!!) And another side of imitation orange beef.
Now that everyone is slowly starting to get their vaccines, I hope to be able to visit a bit more, but there is always a ease of mind when you visit somewhere that is COVID compliant, and just overall have a safe feeling of ordering food or groceries ! Wished I would have taken some pictures of the food, but ill make sure to do so next time!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPh0MeH28kVafCqKZ5Mm6WAfyWhN0S4f-KvNEa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgAhGXpeUzwi6NtRnFuyP-yMd5vP8hPWOVr0uq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8oekIS9zMdbdfKEiAQ4syAEEcOyAn6CyIMI3X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

I love the food, i miss coming here to eat-in. The service is always kind, the food is great and healthy. The seating area was converted to a grocery type store.  Come visit, buy groceries or order food. The menu changes, I uploaded today's menu items just before closing so pickings were thin.< /Review>

I personally found the food delicious and the price point fantastic. I can only comment on the Wednesday takeout menu, but the herb soup and vegan wings are absolutely delicious! There is a fine selection of grocery items as well, including Cha-cha sunflower seeds and vegan jerky!</Review>

Oh my goodness! This place is great. They have a variety of vegan and vegetarian options. They all taste really good! I have never tried solely Taiwanese veggie food. I hope to return soon!

Their dessert and drink options are delicious too! Because of this place, I discovered to mix fruit and jelly desserts with some sweet beans beans that I make myself at home.
The place is small but great for intimate hangouts with friends or family, or your S.O.</Review>

Best vegetarian food buffet in town. It wont disappoint you. Price and quality of food selections  was excellent.  They have different kind of food serve daily. Either lunch or dinner or even breakfast on the weekends. Come early to avoid crowd.  Or you can make it to go, they will provide you a Togo  box. Highly recommend<//text>

The food was a little cold while we were there, even though the restaurant was packed and the staff kept bringing new food out. This only meant that the food was mostly premade. There were a lot of choices. The food was mostly very good and well flavored. They had mock meat items which the texture didn’t agree with my taste. Then again I’m a carnivore in a vegetarian restaurant so I really should expect much.  You have to bus your own table, which I didn’t mind and I saved on tips. Overall it was pretty good despite some shortcomings.< /Review>

<review>I am slowly transitioning to be vegetarian and this place is wonderful for providing me with vegetarian options. Atm Boba ice cream 4.99 likit 1 per customer and avocados 1.59 for 2lbs. Great deals, come support your local business. They got vegetarian jerky amongst other things.< /review><rate>5< /rate><Name>Phu Hoang<//Name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>For the price and close proximity to my house, if give this place 5 star for variety and flavor. If you are looking for a vegetarian lunch place, the place offers a variety of hot and chill food. I especially liked their tempura pumpkin, little buns with condensed milk, medicinal style soup. It doesn't taste too Chinese so I think more people will like it.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>A vegetarian buffet! Need I say more? Well, if I do...The food is tastes great and there seems to always be something new to try out. There are always clean plates and utensils. It always seems to get super busy after 6:30 so if you wait any longer there might be a wait to get a table. You bus your own tables. (Perhaps that's how they keep prices so affordable so please people, clean up after yourself!)< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Inexpensive buffet food.  Nothing outstanding, but what do you want for $11.  If you like all you can eat places, you'll be happy here.  I think I just outgrew buffet food. Nice people and at least they have brown rice, which is a very nice touch.</Review>< pics>

Only place I know that is a vegetarian buffet. Good food with okay service. Location and parking is serviceable but not excellent, and seating is fine but the walking space from food to table ain't ideal. Added a star since they do host a free food demos/lessons, so they're trying to be involved in their community.<//Review>

Decent food, prime time would be around 11:30am where there is still breakfast foods but also rolling out lunch items. I personally like their breakfast items more. Good Chinese donut/油條 and guabao. Their cold noodles was too heavy with vinegar today.. radish dish is good. Decent boba, milk tea and winter melon. Small selection of fruits, oranges and watermelon. Their shaved ice/red bean is not very good in my opinion.</Text>

<Review>Vegetarian all you can eat restaurant in a quiet plaza. It can get quite busy on the weekends, so you'll have to wait. You can also make your own shaved ice and boba drinks. I generally liked the food, but some dishes were a bit oily for my taste.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
One of my favorite places for quick lunch or dinner.   They always serve great variety of Chinese oriented dishes with some specialty sides like pizza or okonomiyaki, plus soup, tea, and desserts.  Very satisfying experience Everytime we visited, which explains the crowd and long waits during meal times.  For anyone likes occasional splurge of good vegetarian all-you-can-eat buffet, Sweet Veggie is highly recommended!<//Review>

Never disappoint. There is always enough staples and there is enough varieties to satisfy.  However I wish more choices on caffeine free drinks. Always eat too much but that is nobody's problem but mine.</Text>

Very disappointed.  Table was dirty and stained.  Utensils were wet.  Food was overly sweet with too much mushroom extract...  Don’t feel it’s a healthy or comforting place to dine.</review>

Anyone who terms this place racist created that racial slur on his or her own. This is a place where I see all ethnic groups eating, meeting,  talking about health and how to eat healthy. I hope people will watch what they say to  create these kind of slur on a place that is "giving", with that price tag and all you can eat??? One must be thankful there are people out there who are into humanity trying to teach people to live a healthy life and preserve the planet. I sincerely thank Sweet Veggie the owners and workers there for their hard work and sacrifice into this venture to help awaken an unhealthy meat eating nation and curb the cries of animals being slaughtered as stated by Philip Wollen in his speech</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I used to hate vegitables. And yet every time I go here, even when I try completely new types of veggies, I am always happy with it.

The menu is constantly rotating but there are a few Staples that are usually there, such as their amazing veggie pizza. I've only seen it once, but I really enjoyed their curry. They also have a not-very-spicy mapo tofu that I liked. Some dishes have meat substitutes in them, and while they aren't always particularly good imitations, they are always at least delicious.

This place is a buffet, so you can get as much as you want. You are expected to bus your own table, but in exchange they do not accept tips. That makes this place an even better value proposition. They also include desserts and drinks.

They are very popular right now, so you may want to avoid the most popular times to avoid having a long wait.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

A solid Chinese vegetarian buffet - it gets five stars because I'm a little biased as a (mostly) vegetarian myself. Don't come expecting a mind blowing experience, just a satisfying one.

Shifting menu but always expect a broad variety. Consistent things include their beverages and deserts - boba, milk tea, shaved ice and condiments, wintermelon tea, coffee, etc.

Highlights include their amazing medicinal/herbal soup, fried mushrooms, Taiwanese rice noodles (mi fen), sauteed vegetables and whatever tofu dish is around that day. And sometimes their sushi/kimbap is enticing.

If I remember right, it's 8 dollars a person for lunch.

(this review is for their weekday lunches. haven't been to dinner or weekend breakfasts)<//review>

<Text>First timer. Arrived for early dinner at 5:30, the place was clean, quiet and food was fresh. This place is mostly vegan with 1-3 dairy items that consisted of dessert. They have a good variety of all you can eat buffet items. There is no server staff, no tableside service, no tipping allowed, bus your own table, self-serve-to-go, no alcohol kind of place. I don't mind this type of restaurant, but if you like to be catered to or want to get your drink on, then this isn't the place for you. The hostess is charming and took time to explain how their system works, she walked me through the diminutive buffet area, and pointed out the hot & cold food, and dessert/beverage stations. They offer white or brown rice, and their food items are rotated throughout the week, so you may not always see the same items. I enjoyed the taro balls, the pasta with peanut sauce, the fresh steamed veggies, tempura green beans, and sushi items (no fish of course). They offered their take on mafo tofu (mild tasting and not pungent at all), they also had pizza & nachos (with non dairy cheese-no thanks), rice porridge, and other items I didn't get to try out because I got stuffed after my 2nd trip to the buffet (had to leave room for dessert). They offer a build your own shaved ice dessert bar with the fixings, fresh made ice tea and lemonade. Their milktea actually had dairy in it (surprising). Overall, it's what you'd expect from a no-extras kind of place. Which at times is what some of us want---no deep thinking about what to have. The music they played overhead was pleasant and relaxing, and my fambam liked the satisfying eats (options), the desserts (fave: yummy chocolate sponge cake, light as a feather), and that it's a buffet with a price point that can't be beat (winner). Definitely gonna try it again just in case I missed something, and to see if it is consistent in their flavors and options. This just may become a new fave go-to place for a quick bite when there's nothing to prep at home or the chef is on strike (lol). (Psst, there's another one of these in Walnut,  but I much prefer this location, which i didn't know it was the same). Wishing you good eats and great times while #foodsploring.</Text>< Date>

I can't say enough nice things about this place so I'll just make a list of everything I like
1. It's cheap for a buffet
2. It's small but the selection you get is always delicious, no wasting time with a giant buffet line trying a little of a billion things, each dish is homemade and cooked with love and you can really taste it
3. No tips! They don't accept them u just basically put ur dirty dishes away for then and enjoy a meal :D
3. If u like meat u will probably like something they have because I kid you not some of the meat immitations they use are so eerily similar a vegan or vegetarian must be thinking they are eating meat.
4. The service is fantastic, the ladies working there are always conscious about your diet and ask and explain if you have any specific questions. But everything is labeled and tells you if it's vegan or vegetarian :D< /Text>

<Time>1541443474634< /Time><Text>Excellent variety of main and side dishes, desserts, and non-alcoholic beverages.  The modest selection of imitation sushi is good, but the best part is most of the items are natural and flavorful - i.e. a few attempts at imitating meat, like fried oysters and sushi meat, while most dishes items are sauteed/cooked vegetables without the heavy gravies or sauces.  It is self service and the carbs, like noodles, are separate from the mains, so you get to take just what you like and sample some things new to you.  (Most vegetarian places either fill you up with a ton of carbs or lots of salad.  Not here.)  This is one place worth the trip and going back to (on the same trip or on different days) - I filled my plate 3 times, and grabbed dessert twice, and I have an athletic physic.  Plus, I'm not even a vegetarian and can say the food is good!  It's family friendly and I would say it's good for Asians and non Asians.< /Text><response>None</response><userid>111472985601339585651</userid><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Pretty good food for the price! All you can eat vegetarian restaurant.  I actually don't know of any other around here with a decent spread. Shaved ice with Ai Yu Jelly, Grass Jelly, sweet mung bean, sweet taro paste, jelly cubes, boba, and plums. Sponge cake was the other dessert. For those who appreciate vegetarian food or endless drinks like wintermelon tea, Taiwanese sweet tea, milk tea, and lemonade, this place is great!<//Review>

Very good place for my parents and friends who are chinese buddhist vegans who are a bit more restricted on their diets.

This is buffet style with usually 8-10 choices of hot food (rotating dishes), consistent selection of cold food, and 3-4 soups. Dessert include shaved ice and some cookies. No soft drinks but milk tea, black tea, and wintermelon tea is offered instead.

They serve Taiwanese style breakfast on Saturday and Sunday morning (Chinese donut, Chinese pancake, eggroll, rice rolls, etc.).

For the price and selection, this is a no brainer.</text>< time>

I came here for the first time after the coronavirus brigade began. Although I have not saw all goods and check all the price . However the goods are complete, the service attitude is great , and the lunch are delicious. I will definitely come again next time.  在新冠狀病毒旅流行開始後，我是第一次來這裡。 雖然我還沒有看到所有貨物並檢查所有價格。 但是商品齊全，服務態度很好，午餐也很好吃。 下次我一定會再來的。-<//review>

(Translated by Google) If your physical condition is not suitable for eating outside food, I suggest coming to this restaurant to eat and eat. Not salty, less oily, you can have a lot of options. Sticky notes on the table will make you feel better. You can bookmark them.

如果你你身体状况不适合吃外面的食物  我建议来这家店吃吃 不咸 少油 你可以有很多的选择性  桌上的便签会让你有所感悟 可以拿去做书签^_^< /Review>

<Text>DJ Al is the absolute BEST!! He made our wedding the most incredible, memorable, and fun night. Al is so professional and fun; he has great ability to read the crowd and made sure the party was non-stop the entire night by always playing the best music selections. My husband and I and our guests spent almost the entire night on the dance floor because we were having so much fun!! AND!!! Be sure to book MY DJ’s photo booth. We had just as much in the booth taking pictures as we did on the dance floor!! If you are looking for a wedding DJ look no further and book DJ Al of MY DJs!!< /Text><resp>None</resp>< Time>

He stuck to the time line of the wedding and worked efficiently with my wedding coordinator. He kept the party going all night! He did an amazing job of mixing up the music and keeping the dance floor hyped! All of my guests complimented our DJ for his dedication to keep the night fun with hyping up the crowd and keeping them dancing. 10/10 would recommend MY DJs for your big event. They were easy to communicate with and always responded in a timely manner!<//review>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>MY DJs – specifically DJ Earl Henry – was the perfect choice for our wedding! He has an extensive online platform that ensures your wedding songs are played at the correct time during the ceremony/reception and helps define what kinds of music you want played throughout. This, coupled with DJ Earl’s experience, helped keep people on the dance floor. If the crowd thinned-out because of a song, DJ Earl would quickly recognize it and fade into another song. He had an amazing personality and was upbeat throughout our wedding! He even guided our guests through some line-dances, which was awesome. After our wedding, many guests commented how great DJ Earl was! We highly recommend MY DJs to anyone!<//Text><Time>1612197962140< /Time>< pictures>

We used MY DJS for our wedding in May 2021 in San Diego, and they were amazing! We originally hired DJ Earl, who unfortunately fell ill a couple of months prior to our wedding. We then met with and hired DJ Gill and we could not have been happier with him! He stepped in to help out last minute with a lot on our plate, and did an amazing job. Helped even help us mix a special song for our first dance! Our main goal was to have the dance floor packed all night long, and our guests are still, a month later, raving about how good the DJ was. We were impressed with the professionalism with the company overall, especially considering the circumstances, and highly recommend MY DJs for any event!!</Review>

The team at My DJs was great! Gill DJ'd our event and helped us with some last minute requests, multiple locations, etc, all with a smile! Everyone I interacted with was very helpful and responsive, from getting the right processional music to working the music to find out what would get people moving and dancing! Very professional group, I would recommend to anyone!< /Review>

MY DJs Company was so helpful and accommodating. Planning before the wedding was a breeze! I loved their online system. The lighting they had provided was exactly what I had been looking for. The music was spot on and our DJ, Tony, was great throughout the whole night. If you're looking for a smooth ride, I'd definitely recommend them.< /text>

Working with MY DJs for mine and my husband's wedding was incredible. Alex helped us figure out exactly what package we wanted and he perfectly understood the kind of music that we wanted played at our wedding. We finalized our music choices for our big moments as well as our dancing music and we had the option of a "do not play" list which was great for keeping some family members from getting too crazy with the music! As the MC, Alex did an amazing job keeping the party going! The music was a perfect combination for our crowd and all of the right songs were played for all of our big moments during the ceremony and reception. I will definitely recommend MY DJs to friends and family!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Earl at My DJs was amazing! We had a private residential party and he threw it over the top! I loved how we were able customize our choice in music. He kept the party light and fun! We ordered the karaoke package as well and would alternate to DJ and a few karaoke songs in between. The light package is MUST! Definitely sets the mood. Everyone had a great time. We didn’t want it to end! We’ll definitely be using him in future events!< /review>

<Text>Alex and Earl were an amazing team for our wedding with MY DJs. Earl's responsiveness when we first hired their group and all throughout the craziness of changing plans because of COVID was unmatched. They got on the phone/video chat with us multiple times just to talk through our party vision, music and just to get to know them more! Alex did a great job on the day adjusting the photo booth to capture the best pictures and Earl kept the dance floor going all night. This group is a step above the rest for their customer service alone, they are so personable and outgoing. We seriously were so satisfied with this group, if you want a beautiful ceremony and an unbelievably fun reception, hire MY DJs!< /Text>< pics>

We had the pleasure of having DJ Earl for our entertainment on 21 Nov 20. He was professional from the beginning to end of the booking process. He arrived early to set up and was ready by the time everyone boarded. He's an absolutely amazing DJ. He kept the party going and played all of our favorite songs. I absolutely recommend.< /review>

Earl Henry performed, as our DJ, at our daughter's wedding in Malibu Beach, CA on November 6th. This gentleman was transparent setting up and then began playing the perfect music for cocktail hour and dinner. He had complete control on announcements with the perfect tone and audibles and coordinated perfectly with the wedding planner for all announcements. THEN......after dinner, toasts etc........let the fun begin........dancing galore. He had all the right songs and had EVERYONE up and on the floor.

Even the pre-event communications and planning were impeccable. He has this planning tool on his website that facilitates all your details and desired songs. If I lived in Cali, I'd use Earl at every event I do in the future. The crowd and we loved him.</Text>

<Text>We found My DJ's San Diego at a wedding expo and their set up is what caught our eye right away! What we liked so much is how they created the whole experience/vibe; lighting, music, decor, Photo Booth, the whole package. DJ Earl was awesome! Very professional, easy to work with and did everything we asked for. Our whole planning process was under 6 months and DJ Earl was able to accommodate us and was patient with us along the way. He was familiar with our venue, came well prepared and had us and our guest dancing all night!!< /Text>< rating>

I started a new job 2 weeks ago, and its been nothing but zoom calls. When Friday came around we were on vacation another zoom call was the absolute last thing I wanted to do. I was burnt out being on camera, talking to people, and honestly wedding planning in general, but I knew we wanted to find the right DJ and its what we had to do.

DJ Earl was the only DJ out of many DJ’s that set up a Zoom call as our first conversation/meeting. From the start of the call to the end, he truly blew us away and we knew we’d found the right DJ. My fiancé is extremely particular about music, enjoys it in its most pure form, doesn’t like excessive scratching, songs being mixed together for too long, and can be very picky when it comes to DJ’s. As we talked to DJ Earl, I enjoyed watching how impressed my fiancé was with him without him even sharing his preferences on what he wanted in a DJ.

DJ Earl:
-Took the time to get to know us
-Made a personal connection with us
-Walked us through his online portal
-Was extremely organized
-Communicative
-Displayed his personality and what he would be like as an emcee
-Provided an impressive live demonstration
-Made ceremony recommendations that we really enjoyed

DJ Earl truly nailed our meeting. We’re so impressed and can’t wait to work with him. If you’re looking for a DJ who will put effort into getting to know you and what you want for your event, and has a great personality – consider DJ Earl!</review>

As a wedding planner, I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to DJs. Having a good DJ can make or break your reception, so I am always hesitant to work with people I haven't worked with before. From our first few email exchanges, I could tell Earl and his team were the ultimate professionals. Not only was he prompt and responsive, he was completely self-sufficient and didn't need a bunch of extra things from me. On the day-of, he was the ultimate professional being timely, energetic, and a true engaging force. He didn't try to steal the show away from my couple like I've seen before with others, but rather blended well into the background when he needed to and took command when attention was demanded. Earl had an awesome variety and mix of music; you can tell he really knows what he's doing--but most importantly loves it! I will be adding him and My DJs to my preferred vendor list moving forward.<//Text>

DJ Earl was absolutely the best DJ/MC we could have ever asked to have at our wedding. Aside from his skills on the turn tables and outgoing personality, he really helped with the planning of the timeline and we benefited greatly from his many years of experience. The use of the MyDjs website and the video conferences and meetings prior to the wedding really helped give us and idea of what kind of services and quality we’d be receiving. My wife and I had a customized first dance song which DJ Earl mixed prior to our wedding that allowed us to practice to the actual song so it turned out perfect. Many of our wedding guests complimented our choice of DJ and said they were impressed by the quality of music and DJ Earl getting out on the dance floor to get people dancing or leading the line dancing. We recommend DJ Earl and MyDjs to anyone looking to have the best in the business at their next event—we will definitely be using them again.<//review>

DJ Ashley is AMAZING. We hired Ashley to DJ for me and my husband's wedding, and the one common statement that everyone from our wedding keeps telling us is how awesome our DJ was. Our wedding consisted of many families and middle-aged folks, along with our friends (20's-30's range). She did a great job reading the party and understanding what it needed and what songs to play. Everyone of all ages was dancing for literally the entire night. She really made our wedding a hit and she was so great to work with. I very highly recommend DJ Ashley.</text>

We had a 5K Walk/Run/Expo event in late April. Alex was our DJ and did a terrific job. He played music that was perfect at every stage of the event and interacted with participants (young/old, active/not active, exhibitor/participant) perfectly. Attendees were amazingly engaged and had a great time in large part because of Alex. Thank you!<//Review>

Thanks so much for making the evening a huge hit!< /review>< pics>

MY DJs San Diego was such a pleasure to work with during our wedding planning. They were fun, professional, and highly organized. We gave them a very mixed song request list and at our reception, They managed to flow from one genre to another seamlessly and beautifully - he went from Jazz, to pop, to mariachi, to oldies, to rock, to pop, to merengue, to cumbia to soul to r&b. Their DJ played remixes on the spot! He rocked!!! Aside from the music , he worked with the venue to cue all the events taking place during the night - he even checked in with the wedding party before introductions to make sure he was pronouncing all our names correctly . From the moment you meet with their DJ at their studio and listen to a LIVE DEMO, you will be sold. No disappointments!<//Review>

The Music quality and the way he transition from grand entrance to First Dance then letting people relax and eat.. everything was just perfect! I had a small / medium size wedding reception and I thought i didn’t need a DJ. However Omg it made a difference using MyDJs. His communications was always quick and easy. He helped me create a smooth timeline to make sure everything was perfect. If we didn’t use Earl for our reception I don’t think people would have been happy like they were after our reception.

My spouse and I put 100% of our trust in DJ Earl and we’re grateful we did! He knew exactly what to do with the suggestions/recommendations we gave him and “read the room” perfectly during the reception.

After the reception, several of our guests came up to us and praised DJ Earl’s ability to make the night an enjoyable and memorable one.

Thanks, DJ Earl!</Review>

<text>DJ Earl was fantastic! He helped make our wedding day flow so nicely and kept our guests entertained while doing it. I loved the online portal he has to help organize and personally select the order of events and songs. I didn’t realize how much goes in to planning a wedding on the Dj’s side but Earl has it all laid out and easy to navigate. So glad he could be a part of our special day, he also looked great doing it!! We also added the photo booth package which I highly recommend. Fun entertainment for your guests and so fun to look back on the pictures.<//text>< user_name>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>DJ Tony, you. are. AWESOME!

My DJs was recommended to us by two other couples and I cannot say enough good things about these guys. Highly professional, easy to work with, very communicative and so, so, so fun.

DJ Tony was on-point from the first time we met him to the last minute of our wedding. Wildly charismatic, attentive and genuinely cares about his clients. We had a few absolutes, but left Anthony up to the rest, and he did not disappoint. Fun? Check. Some heartfelt stuff? Yep. Booty-shaking? Absolutely.

DJ Tony pulled off the perfect mix of being the voice of our wedding, and also just letting things flow. He had no trouble finding the songs we wanted and created a seamless, fun wedding, in addition to helping Caitlin and I just breathe and appreciate the moment.

I can't say enough good things about DJ Tony and HIGHLY recommend him.< /Review>< UserId.>

<text>If you're looking for a DJ for your event, whatever it may be, look no further!! DJ Earl Henry with My DJs San Diego is THAT good.
One of the biggest requirements for our wedding was great music and an amazing DJ. Isn't that the case for everyone? I remembered DJ Earl from a wedding I attended back in 2012 and remember thinking he was incredible. So when we started planning our own wedding, my husband and I immediately reached out to Earl at My DJs. From the very beginning, we were hooked. From the prompt responses to our inquiries to the initial meeting and everything following, My DJs was fabulous! Not to mention their online planning forms made everything so easy.
When it came time for our big day, DJ Earl knocked it out of the park. You guys, this guy is remarkable!! All we wanted was an epic dance party and that is exactly what we got. My husband and I NEVER left the dance floor! Our guests are STILL raving about how great DJ Earl and the music were at our wedding and that is a sign of someone who has truly perfected their craft. We can't thank DJ Earl enough for making our wedding the best night of our lives! If great music and entertainment are non-negotiable items for your event, book with My DJs. You won't regret it!!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>We hired DJ Israel "Hot Chocolate" for our wedding. We had a great time and at least half of the people in attendance have since made a point of telling me personally how they loved our DJ. DJ Hot Chocolate keeps the party moving with the right song at the right time. Very importantly he is also a good MC which is critical at an event like a wedding when certain marks need to be hit and managed (think first dance, toasts, cake cutting, etc...).  I will be hiring DJ Hot Chocolate again soon.

If you are in need of a DJ, he will audition for you and meet with you to make sure he understands your needs. If you are planning a wedding, they have top notch tools online to make sure that no detail is forgotten.

Support this veteran who served our country!</text>< Pictures>

<Review>When my now-husband and I were looking at DJs for our wedding this October, we were arguing about whether or not we "needed" a DJ... we were on a tight budget, and he just didn't see the value. But I convinced him to meet with DJ Early, and by the time we left the studio, my husband was a believer and we were finally on the same page. DJ Earl did such an amazing job communicating with us during the planning process, which I call out due to the amount of changes we had. And we couldn't be happier with his performance at our wedding reception. He handled some of our drunken guests with professionalism and patience, and made sure that we, as well as our guests, had the best time. I was on the dance floor ALL night. We highly recommend to anyone!< /Review>< Pictures>

A big shout out to DJ Earl for doing an amazing job at our annual Easter event for our Wounded Warrior family and kids. Earl was a joy to work with, and he even got out there and danced with the kids. His personality was perfect to work with kids and new just what to play that was age appropriate for all to enjoy even the teenagers and adults.  Earl, it was great to have you be a part of a very special day for our warriors and we look forward to using your services in the future. Thank you for helping us make this year's Easter event a great memory for all.< /text>

I worked with Earl on a recent wedding and I totally recommend him to anyone interested in hiring a DJ and MC for their wedding. Being a wedding coordinator, I always try to educate my couples on the importance of hiring a good DJ that knows how to run a wedding. Earl is not only on top of that, but he goes above and beyond. He took the time to meet the entire bridal party before the grand entrance and speeches and explain them how to hold the microphone and he made them feel comfortable with the situation which is super important as sometimes it is easy to be stressed out! Once I provided him the timeline, he really did not need any support from me. If this was not enough, he also made sure that his suit was matching the wedding colors!<//review>

If anyone is looking for  DJ we highly recommend My DJs. From day one they were very professional and listen to what we wanted. Jorge was our DJ and let me tell we were so pleased with his professionalism. He truly listened to what we wanted and played everything we asked for. He even played one lat song that my mom requested at the end of the night. You made her night with that song! Thank you so much to everyone at My DJs for your attention!</review>

<text>DJ Earl was awesome! He kept the party going the whole night, the dancefloor was packed from start to finish. And he's a consummate professional. He actually got married the night before we did, and still showed up 100% prepared and killed it! He was the perfect choice for our wedding and a great guy, can't recommend him highly enough.< /text>< pics>

My husband and I just got married on 8-11-18 and we hired DJ Earl Henry. From start to finish, Earl was great. He was super professional and easy to contact whenever we had questions. The My DJs website and online portal made it super easy to give song recommendations for each aspect of our wedding. In addition to the awesome music, the lighting and the photo booth were also amazing!

I had multiple guests come up to me and talk about how good the DJ was.

Earl sure knows how to keep the party going!

Thank you, Earl!!

<username>linda deguz</username><review>We had the opportunity to work with Alex and DJ Earl for my sister's bridal shower using their beautiful and compact social media photo booth. It was a hit at the party!! The photo booth was not ur typical photo booth. It had unique effects (GIFs, boomerang, stickers, etc...) you can use and you can send the photos to yourself electronically so u can post on your social media. These guys were professional, polite, and prompt. We had one minor technical difficulty with the social media photo booth but they did not hesitate to resolve the problem immediately. I would definitely use this company again. We appreciate their service and making my sister's bridal shower a memorable event. I'd HIGHLY recommend them to anyone.</review>< UserId.>

<review>DJ Earl and the MYDJ's team are AMAZING!! My wife and I just got married this month at a family friends house so we had to bring in all our own vendors. We are music SNOBS so the DJ was VERY important to us. He showed up on time and was prepared with everything he needed. He took the prep work seriously and his online portal was very user friendly which lead to a smooth wedding day. He's quick on his feet, has great dance moves, and keeps the dance floor engaged. Everything we wanted!! We highly recommend DJ Earl and the MYDJ's team for anyone looking for music and photo booth vendors.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1576570766807, 'text': 'Being complimented by another DJ means a lot!

<review>Israel aka "DJ Hot Chocolate", was the best choice for my wedding! Initially I had a DJ booked through my venue, but decided to find my own DJ, it was the best decision I could of made. He is very entertaining, funny, professional, and knows how to get the party jumping from finish to start. He had everyone up on the dance floor, he interacted with my guest, he pretty much felt like family, that's how much he fit right in with everyone. My wedding was a week ago, and people are still talking about how good Israel was. I will most definitely be booking again in the near future. Thanks MyDj’s for the excellent service.</review>< Date>

<review>As a wedding planner the vendors I work with are key to having a successful event. DJ Earl was absolutely awesome to work with! He was great leading up the event. Always quick to respond and very professional. Then on the day of the event he was fantastic! He is a great communicator and listener. He followed the timeline, was very responsive to me and super fun to work with. He kept the dance floor going all night long and the wedding guests were loving every minute of it. He is an amazing team player and I would recommend him to anyone! Thank you DJ Earl for an incredible event!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<text>"As we walked around our wedding reception other than the normal words of congratulations the most common comment we got was, "Where did you find this DJ?  He's amazing!".

Dealing with Israel prior to the event was a pleasure, even when we weren't always timely on getting him the information he needed.  He ran the ceremony flawlessly, and seamlessly handled a difficult split between the ceremony and reception sites on a tight timeline.   During the reception Israel managed the ebbs and flows of the various parts perfectly and made the garter and bouquet tosses a true highlight of the event.  Once it was open dance time Israel kept the crowd engaged and dancing, often by jumping out on the floor himself.

In short, if you're looking for a DJ that can handle a quaint garden wedding, but will have grandma bumping it down the soul train row at the reception, you can't do better than Israel "DJ Hot Chocolate" Florence!"</text><user_id>114652655753221039926< /user_id><Time>1565104233051</Time>< pictures>

<text>I cannot say enough great things about DJ Earl! He was so professional from the beginning. During the wedding planning period, he communicated well and in a timely manner. We didn't have time to select all our wedding songs, but he asked about our style and the genres we liked and worked that into our wedding. It was perfect! He worked the crowd and announced everything that was happening from the first dance to cake cutting. This made everything confusion free and so much fun! If someone requested a song, he always made sure it was ok with us! He was also dressed very nicely and I'm so sad I didn't get to take a picture with him:( I'll just have to rely on my memory!

I am a local photographer that had a wedding with My DJs San Diego, specifically with @mydjs.israel. He was a ball of energy, and as I walked around taking photos I could hear guests raving about how amazing he was. I noticed he was open to song requests from guests, was great at maintaining a good flow of the night and even jumped on the dance floor a few times to demonstrate different group dances. I can't say enough great things about this team! They will make your wedding reception a unforgettable night!< /Review>

<review>We found Earl about a week prior to our large company event (about 200 guests), when other options didn't work out. He went out of his way to personally meet with me to go over our event details and make sure everything was perfect. He enhanced our event with fun music, amazing lights, and even a video loop. I haven't stopped receiving compliments from how much he added to the event. We will be making him a permanent part of all of our future events! Thank you DJ Earl for alleviating a lot of our stress by taking care of our audio and visual needs, as well as suggesting other fun stuff to enhance the event (purple up lights, TVs with video loop, etc.)</review>< pictures>

We found my djs at the bridal bazaar in January. We got information from them at their booth and shortly after booked a consultation. We met with DJ Earl and both my husband and I instantly clicked with me after meeting. He was so thorough in his meeting and even sampled a little set for us to get an idea of wedding day. He was nothing short of amazing on the wedding day. He kept our friends and family entertained all night long! We also enjoyed the photobooth that we added into our package.</Text>

It is such a pleasure sharing a review about our experience working with DJ Hoody.  Our daughter was recently married in Richmond, Virginia.  I had contacted this disc jockey a year in advance to book his services, as he was very well known in the Richmond area and my daughter was so excited to work with him.  Let me say, as mother of the bride, I was very impressed with all of the professional planning and guidance he offered to us.  DJ Hoody provided us with a wedding reception checklist that covered all of the bases, from bridal party introductions to a music request playlist.  His ability to transition from one song to the next with no down time was amazing. He was our DJ and a great host for the entire evening celebration.  DJ Hoody committed to hosting our wedding, as mentioned, a year in advance.  Our family highly recommends the musical services of DJ Hoody.  A gem to work with!<//Text>

They were professional and courteous from start to finish. Extremely prompt and helpful with anything we need with our event. And DJ Tony Slater was extremely professional but knew how to work and hype up a crowd. If you need to book a DJ, especially for professional events such as a Marine corps Ball. MyDjs is a definite choice</text>

DJ Earl is a true professional and master of his craft. Everyone at our wedding had an amazing time and I can't think of a time where there was no one on the dance floor. DJ Earl kept the energy up the whole night and truly made it a memorable day for us!</Text>

We found MY DJs on yelp and contacted them to see what services they provided. Once we know DJ Earl is available we set up a video conference to meet and greet. I especially like when Earl showed us how he would mixed different type of songs right in front of us, at the studio, during the video call!

Earl for sure know what he is doing! Our recessional song was spot on just at the right moment, did a great job getting our guests on the dance floor, and he just knows when to play what type of songs throughout the night (we had pop, 80s, slow songs, and some other random genre...LOL). Thank you Earl!!  :) :)</review>

We couldn't have been luckier to get Dj Leon for our wedding! Not only did he play the best music, he also listened to all our requests, was kind to all our guests and was always available to help us plan our big day! Dj Leon is incredibly professional and if you are looking for a fun time, this is your guy. We couldn't be happier! Thank you Dj Leon!</Review>

DJ Earl is outstanding. He's so friendly, upbeat, and had the perfect music playlist. He also has a really great voice on the microphone for announcements, which I think is a big plus. Once it was time for the party to get started last night, he got everyone out of their seats and dancing to the beats! Everyone had such a fun time and it was a pleasure to see them smiling and dancing because of the music he selected. One great hit after another. The party was a big success. I'd hire my dj's for any future events!< /Review>

DJ Earl and his crew made our recent wedding a wonderful event! He was very friendly, was a great MC, and his crew manning the photo booth was excellent as well. They did the DJ, photobooth, uplighting and really set the atmosphere for our wedding and made sure everything flowed smoothly. Our guests keep telling us how awesome the music was, he accommodated requests and special songs and was all around a great DJ!</text>

We booked DJ Earl for our wedding as he was highly recommended by not only our venue but also our photographers. He EXCEEDED our expectations! Our guests danced the night away and said that it was one of the best weddings they ever attended. He created so many special moments at the wedding with the music from the traditional dances (e.g. first dance, father/daughter) to an unexpected bridal circle and anniversary dance.
DJ Earl is extremely professional. We were planning our wedding from out of state and he accommodated us by meeting via skype. In fact, we had a family emergency pop up at the last minute and Earl worked with us to make changes to our song list within 24 hours of the wedding. We highly recommend his services for any event!

<text>My DJs is a sure bet when you're looking for a DJ! Earl is as experienced as they come and can get the party going like no other. He is a lot of fun, plays the right mix for the crowd, and is an excellent MC. His is very easy to work with and has a wealth of information on all things wedding that he is able to share with his couples. As a wedding coordinator, it is important to me that I work with DJ's that are communicative, professional and able to lead the party. Earl is all of that and more! I highly highly recommend Earl & My DJs! You will not be disappointed.</text>< Resp>

This company is spot on and Earl was great throughout the whole process. The setup with lights, dj booth and speakers was very high quality. Thanks Mydjs!</Text>

<review>MyDjs and Earl were fantastic! We were planning a destination wedding in San Diego from 2K miles away and Earl went above and beyond to help accommodate us. The MyDjs portal is also a great tool that helped us plan out and communicate how we wanted our big day to go.

On the actual wedding day, Earl's professionalism really stood out as he knew how and when to speak with both the venue staff and also when was a good time to communicate with both of us (groom and bride). Above all, the most important key to a great DJ is knowing how to read the crowd and Earl's experience really showed here. When the energy level on the dance floor would start to drop, Earl would play the perfect song to get everyone moving again, that's all we could ask for! If you're looking for a great wedding dj, look no further!< /review>< pics>

<Review>I must say I had a wonderful experience with the entire company.  From the initial call to the day following our wedding. DJ Stephen was awesome.  He made himself available to answer any questions or make any changes and on the day of he handled all the little things that I might not have thought of.  He kept me informed the whole event and made sure that all I had to do was enjoy the day. But most importantly he kept the dance floor packed. All my guests enjoyed the music and we're happy to dance the night away. I'm looking for another reason to throw a party  just so I can hire him again.</Review>< Pics>

I am sooo glad we found this company! During my wedding planning, I was just browsing through instagram and came across pictures with MY DJS - located in San Diego. Let me just say, HEAVEN SENT!! We booked an appointment with Mr. DJ EARL himself. He is a very friendly and down to earth person! Very easy to work with! We got to see samples of his lighting and he definitely met our request with our music taste and preference. The day of the wedding was smooth like butter and we really didn't have to worry about anything. Great to have an EMCEE and DJ all in one! Everyone had a great time at our wedding and we still get compliments to this day about how fun the party was. Thanks MISTA DJ!!!!!!<//Review>

<Review>DJ Earl was amazing at our Company Christmas Party! He had everyone in the company on the dance floor, even the people who "don't dance" were busting a move. DJ Earl brought glow wands which were so fun! The up-lighting he brought couldn't have been more perfect. He even brought a snowflake monogram which went with our Winter Wonderland theme.  He played a variety of music that fit everyone's taste. our party was on Saturday and Monday morning in the office DJ Earl is the most talked about part of the party; and how awesome he was and because of him this was the best party they have been to! We WILL be booking DJ Earl again!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Best DJ ever! We wanted a DJ who could mix hip-hop and latin music for our wedding. More than half of our playlist was latin music, and DJ Earl exceeded our expectations. He had everyone dancing all night and played all of the songs we loved. He was very professional and attentive to all details of the wedding to ensure it ran smoothly. We also rented the open-air photo booth and that was a hit too. Great picture quality and lots of props which made it extra fun for our guests. Thanks again for making our night fun and memorable!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Omg!! So so so much fun!! DJ Earl was AMAZING! From the beginning he made our experience the best. He gave us an amazing quote and demo in their studio! The planning profile was perfect since I was able to take my time & add everything I needed. My favorite part was that he was able to personalize the planning form that was same-sec friendly! The night before I asked Earl if he could bring the photo booth last minute since it was going to rain & he was able to do so at a very good price! All in all I definitely recommend MyDJs! Even my wedding coordinator asked who he was since he really liked him. The energy, the professionalism, and Earl's experience made our wedding unforgettable! There was a mix of pop, hip hop, reggeaton, Banda, and zapateados and everyone loved it!! Thank you Earl and MyDJs for making our special day an unforgettable and turnt wedding even with the huge storm in the background!!!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Name>Regina Gerbeaux< /Name><Review>DJ Israel Florence, aka "DJ Hot Chocolate," was OUTSTANDING. He kept our party going, and chose all of the appropriate music for our very diverse crowd. Everyone, from my very traditional Asian family, to my husband's international friends (from France), to our coworkers and friends who are local to here, enjoyed the party, and at one point, I would say that 90% of our attendees were on the dance floor partying it up! Mind you, this crowd was a hard-to-please, quiet crowd, that I would say are quiet 99% of the time--but you would've never guessed it from that night, because DJ Hot Chocolate got the crowd moving and brought out that 1% of wild, crazy fun from our attendees! I can honestly say that I've never attended a wedding as crazy, fun, loud, and memorable as this one--and I'm just glad that this was MY wedding!

Everything, from the DJ hyping up the crowd, to our first dance music, to the ceremony songs, to the Cupid Shuffle (!!! most fun!!!), was executed perfectly. From beginning to end, DJ Hot Chocolate really took the driver's seat and steered the wheel, leaving absolutely nothing for my husband and I to worry about. We were able to dance the night away and have fun with our friends.

Best of all, DJ Hot Chocolate is warm, friendly, personable, and really cares about you before, during, AND after the wedding. Our guests complimented the song choices over and over again, and loved the music and the PHOTOBOOTH!

Earl Henry was also a pleasure to work with, and was easy to talk to and professional when it came to setting up our contract for the DJ, uplights, and photobooth.

We had a diverse group of vendors, some that were good, and some that were awful, but MyDJs was by far one of the most professional and AMAZING vendors we worked with. We are thankful they made our night a night to remember!</Review>< Response>

We were fortunate to have DJ TigerLily (Lily Shevitz) perform at my best friends wedding a couple of weeks ago.  She rocked it!!!!!  Every jam she played was hot.  We had the time of our lives and we owe it to her for keeping the energy high.  She is such a professional, and a good hearted person.  I definitely recommend that you request Lily as your DJ and your next event.  She will definitely exceed your expectations!<//text>

<review>We had Danny Aon as our DJ and he was awesome! He was very helpful and gave us good ideas for the ceremony and the reception during our wedding preparation. MyDJ also provided us with a website where we could login, list our music preferences, attach some notes on the songs that we picked, specify timeline and  others details, which was very useful to get us organized. DJ Danny did a great job following everything that we specified on the website. He also made the transitions very smooth from song to song. It was a very fun wedding celebration and everyone had a great time :D
Danny also sent us several great photos that he took a couple days after the wedding. Thanks Danny!< /review><response>None<//response><time>1506372197298< /time>< pics>

<Response>{'time': 1516733397613, 'text': 'Dear Sgt Cory Navarrete\nCareer Planner\n4th MAW Site Support\nMCAS Miramar, CA 92145\n\nIn 2014, a past DJ was unexpectedly late for set up and you constantly text messaged our business cell phones in a very discordant and unprofessional manner regarding the DJ being late and not prepared for the slideshow audio.  We were actually not contracted for the A/V projector set up, that is an additional charge on top of the DJ services and was never requested.  Although the guests had a great time dancing, you were compensated a full refund for all trouble and inconveniences.\n\nIn 2015,  you called us back and we had a different professional DJ perform.  You gave him a DVD with music on the night of event that was not properly formatted to play but the DJ had all of the songs already and was still able to play all requests.  Our contract specifies receiving all media 5 days prior to even. Throughout the night, you text messaged my office manager in a very unpleasant and loud tone complaining.  You could have communicated with our DJ of any issues so they could have been solved right away.  We have a very strong relationship with our Military and event coordinators and have performed over 25 Marine balls that month.  We are the preferred DJ company for Camp Pendleton as well.  We do our best to provide and exceed expectations of great DJ services for such important celebrations and have never experienced such inappropriate behavior.  SSgt Pozo, Victor H., Logistics Chief at 4th MAW Site Support Miramar mentioned we did a great job and you were no longer part of the ball committee.  The head commander complimented the DJ for doing an awesome job that night.  I feel it is unfair for you to continue writing negative comments and untrue facts about our company.   I would greatly appreciate if this was removed.'}< /Response>< GmapID>

I never thought kickboxing could be so much fun and provide anything more than a challenging workout. This place offers so much more: stress relief, companionship, laughter (so much laughter), and supportive coaches that genuinely care about each individual joining them on the mat. I‘m so glad I‘m part of the ILKB Roseville family!!</Text>

iLoveKickboxing is AWESOME! The coaches are excellent and offer a ton of encouragement & motivation. The members are friendly & fun as well. You are able to get what you want out of the workout based upon your goals. Honestly ILKB - Roseville has the best workouts I've done and I've been at it for 30 years. They make it fun and everyone is family. I love it! I encourage you to try it out :-)<//review>

I have been at this studio for almost two years and the feeling of family that I get from this studio is incredible. It is not the same thing you get from a big gym. We help each other and cheer each other on. The coaches are very friendly and personable. They really try to get to know every member. They also have all you can drink water, LOL. It's a clean facility and smells good all the time. Lifetime member right here!< /Text>

<review>I love this gym! I like that it is a class environment, but you also get one on one help. There are always at least two coaches to help your form and encourage you to keep going! Everyday is a different workout so your body is always improving. My favorite part is the partner drills! It’s a great way to meet people and work on your coronation. Sign up today! You won’t regret it!!!</review>< name>

<review>I am loving it here! I’ve never met such genuine and great coaches that really feel like they care about you! The workouts are amazing and the best part is, you barely feel like you’re working out but still getting great results! I am stronger and healthier and motivated to go because of the super fun atmosphere!<//review></record>

iLoveKickboxing – Roseville is so much fun. Every class is a challenge but it’s a good challenge and I feel like I’ve accomplished something at the end. The workouts are different every week. Which is great because I don’t get bored, but I have a week to learn all the moves and get better. There are people of all abilities in the classes and everyone is very friendly. The Instructors and staff are amazing. They will chat with your before or after class and during class they are encouraging and keep you motivated. I also love that during the class there are always at least two instructors and they will go around and correct your form and give you tips to help you do the moves right. I love it, I can’t wait for the next class.< /Text>

<text>Unprofessional, instructors are indeed proficient kickboxers, but could use a marketing course. As a budget conscientious college student who refuses to pay for overpriced services, I was not ideal prey. A friend and I did a groupon for 4 sample classes + free gloves. After the 2nd class, when we tried to schedule appointments for the next class, we were ignored after a series of about 10 calls total between my friend and I, with 3 voicemails. Neither of us were answered, not any calls returned, despite calling at moments between classes (schedule posted online). We were blatantly not well liked, perhaps for the fact that we were obviously not interested in forking over a non existent income. "I'm sure if you cut out your daily starbucks you'll find the $" I'd have to have daily starbucks for that to work. Overall, I'd recommend Marinoble's down the road. They are established and have higher quality facilities, rather than a tiny retail space.</text>< user_id>

I love ILKB! Every time I go in, whether it's been regularly or after a stint of lack of motivation, the team always remembers me, is friendly and shows that same enthusiasm on the mat! It's clear that the instructors believe in their workouts and more importantly they believe and back everyone who puts on a pair of gloves. Definitely one of the best places I've ever invested my time in for a workout!< /review>

<text>I love kickboxing is the perfect name for this studio! I seriously love this place. First off the studio is always clean and inviting and I have never walked in there without being greeted by my name. There are many members but the trainers know everyone BY NAME because it is very much like family there. The workout itself is challenging, but there is always a trainer nearby to encourage you or help improve your form. The whole environment is motivating, from the music to other members. Secondly, it is seriously so fun, that you hardly notice the hour go by! I was not into group exercise environment prior to coming here. This place has definitely changed my mind, I can’t imagine going back to a gym and plugging in earbuds and just going. Third, the results I have seen in the short amount of time that I have been there have been amazing. I have lost inches and have noticed a lot of toning up in all the right areas. Also, my energy has greatly improved and I just feel all around great! And last but not least, I cannot say enough about this part, but what it does for you mentally is immeasurable. I became a member right around the time of a huge loss. It helped so much to kick and punch stuff, and I give so much credit to the positive trainers, the amazing environment, and kickass workout, that I got through that time in a healthy way. Overall, highly recommend this place!<//text><Date>1537836853547<//Date>< Pictures>

These classes are amazingly wonderful! I noticed a difference in my first week. I was so excited to finally try something I loved. I drive 45 minutes a couple times a week to get to the class, and if that doesn't show how much I absoutley love this class, then I don't know what does!<//Review>

They consistently monitor your bag work to make sure you are positioned correctly so you don't injure yourself.  Everyone is there to get a good work out and be supportive.

I had just moved back to the Sacramento area, and was looking for a fun place to work out and meet new people when I stumbled upon iLoveKickboxing's yelp page! I checked out the website, decided the online special was too good to pass up, and came in for my very first class 2 days later. The class was an amazing workout, but most importantly, it was FUN and seemed to fly by! I had a great time and can't wait to come back for round 2</text>

This place is amazing! I was bored with the typical gym experience and after having my third baby, I needed a workout that was not only going to kick my booty, but also keep me coming back because it was fun. The wonderful staff at ILoveKickboxing have far exceeded my expectations! Joining as a member has been one of the best things I've done for myself in a long time!< /Review>

<review>I have been going to ilovekickboxing for almost 2 months now and I love it!  When I signed up for my first day I was anxious and excited at the same time but walking in the door and being greeted by the friendly staff instantly put the anxiety at ease. The positive energy when you walk thru the doors is contagious and makes me come back for more! I now plan my days around my work outs! I haven't been going long but am already seeing my muscles tone up, my confidence has grown, clothes that I normally wear are now too big and on top of that, I feel amazing!</review>< Pictures>

<review>This. Do this for yourself. I have never sweated so much like this nor burn this much calories when I go to the gym for an hour. This experience has already done so much for me than the past 15 YEARS of having a gym membership has! There is a genuine community. The staff are fun and dedicated to you succeeding. I finally found my fitness tribe... and it's saving me mentally, emotionally and physically. I could never thank them enough!

I have been a member for a little over two months and I love ilovekickboxing! It is a fantastic workout and I’ve never sweated so much in my life! I was hooked from my very first class…I was looking for something that I wouldn’t get bored with. Other gyms and my at home work-outs just couldn’t keep my interest or keep me motivated. I can’t believe I’ve gotten into the habit of waking up at 5:30am to go to the early class…I’ve never been able to do that without a struggle. I love that kickboxing requires me to focus. For an hour, whatever problems I may have outside of the studio disappear as I concentrate on perfecting the combos! I always leave with a smile on face and an amazing feeling that I did something awesome for myself. The instructors are always upbeat, encouraging, and always greeting you when you arrive. It’s like a family! You can also purchase apparel, hand wraps, etc. from their selection of merchandise.<//review>

Looooove ILKB. The staff is upbeat and motivating. The other members are invested in your personal success and help keep you encouraged. You cannot get that at a regular gym. It is always spotless and never smells musty. Which is amazing! Everyone should come and at least try them out. They always have good deals going on.</Review>

If you're looking for an amazing workout and positive atmosphere this is the place you need to be. Everyone is so positive and welcoming I look forward to my early morning workouts. You can tell the instructors truly want you to succeed and they will always help you if an exercise is confusing or challenging. It's the only place you can get a combo and still lose weight! There's nowhere else I'd rather get my sweat on than ilkb Roseville!< /Text>

I was looking for a new workout program because I've learned over the years I do better with a structured class than trying to wing it on my own at a gym. I had taken a cardio kickboxing class in college and enjoyed it so when a friend told me about iLoveKickboxing I signed up for their 3 class special to try it out. It was HARD but it also made me feel great! I've been going for about 3 months now and I can really see how it's changing my mind and body. When I first started I couldn't do a single push-up to save my life. Now I can do 12 and I keep pushing for more! I'm excited to get up early and hit class before work and even go on the weekend. I'm so happy to finally find something that I can stick with and that benefits me in so many ways. It really is like a fit family with the great staff and members!< /Text>

If you’re looking for a fun, effective and high energetic way, look no further. ILKB has a lot to offer. Their instructor lead workouts are super fun and they are different each day. You’ll never do the same workout twice, and they are only an hour long. The instructors and the members are so welcoming, they encourage you and motivate to keep coming back for more. ILKB has had a huge positive impact on my life and continues to do so. When I first started I was a size 12, pushing my limits to a 14. 2 years later, I am down to a size 4, I have no love handles or back fat. I feel amazing. I would recommend checking out ILKB for sure. Your health and your mental well being deserves it.

It’s totally worth it. Stick to it and you won’t regret it!!</Review>

<Review>I was so excited when iLoveKickboxing, Roseville finally opened! I gained over 80lbs when I got pregnant with my daughter and was struggling to get the last 30lbs off. Managing working full-time and being a new mom- iLovekickboxing was just what I needed. An intense cardio/strength training program rolled into an hour! The atmosphere is fun and the staff are excited to be there. With a commitment with 3x a week, I am already seeing results! Feeling strong and healthy makes me more confident to be the best mom I can be! My 1 hour session is one of the highlights of my day- I get to have "me" time while rocking out to fun music and getting in shape at the same time! I couldn't recommend it enough!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

The staff is always so positive and supportive, it's like nothing I've tried before. I got to that point after having my second son where the pounds stopped coming off. I felt defeated and I was becoming depressed about my body and how I was still 25 lbs heavier than I wanted to be. It was time I truly committed to something and am so happy I found ILKB. I love the workouts and the sets, every class is something new, but also building upon the knowledge you already have. They have added a bunch of early morning classes which is great for this working mom's schedule.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>Ilovekickboxing has changed my life! I have not loved working Out since being on a team in high school! Now I feel like I'm part of a "team" but more like a family. The owners, manager and instructors are some of the friendliest people I have ever met! And you can tell it's genuine, since starting. It is hands down the best workout! I have fallen in love with going! I go at least 4-5 times a week and have lost over 10 lbs and more than 10 inches since starting in June. I never get sick of it because it's always different and it feels so good to punch a bag. Thank ilkb! You guys are doing awesome!< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< pics>

ILKB is an awesome place! We purchased the Groupon deal and loved it so much we signed up. The instructors are all great! Really know how to kick your butt lol into shape! The gym is clean, they wipe down the bags after each session. Everyone is friendly! It's not like a regular gym! It's FUN!!
I highly recommend it!!!<//text>

<Text>IL♡KB Roseville was such an awesome discovery for my mom and me. We had come from a kickboxing program in Omaha and were looking for something that gave us the same great workout. ILKB Roseville delivered! My endurance has increased and each instructor has their own plethora of knowledge for you to choose from. I struggle with tight hamstrings and hips and they always have a stretch to suggest to help loosen me up. Definitely a great location with a great staff who is always upbeat and encouraging!< /Text><userid>106706988633190542858<//userid><Gmap_id>0x809b2106fb5031f1:0xbbdd5b68171fcde7<//Gmap_id>< Date>

I love that they have an instructor showing you proper technique and going over their routine with you for your first class so you don't fall behind and get the best out of your workout.

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I took my first class at ILKB about three weeks ago because I am completely out of shape. I have tried several forms of exercise (Mama Bootcamp, Crossfit (yuck!!!), walking the neighborhood), but couldn’t find a thing that I could stick with long-term. Kickboxing is very different - because of the variety of exercises the workout offers, I don’t feel it will get dull as fast.

Each session is an hour long and can be broken up as follows:
~20 minute warm up (running, squats, push ups, lunges, burpees, etc.)
~5 minutes stretching
~25 minutes bag work (punching, kicking)
~5 minutes partner drills
~5 minutes stretching

At each session there are about three coaches present who will walk around and help participants improve their techniques. I was pleased to see people there of all ages and fitness levels. I would say the average age of the participants is about 35-40 years old. Staff is super welcoming, friendly, and supportive of any newcomers and present members.

The gym itself is very nice as well. The main room has about 22 bags and so far it has not been so crowded that I’ve had to share with anyone. While the classes are co-ed (although predominantly female), there are two locker rooms, one for each gender. You can bring a lock to secure your belongings. Another nice thing is that there is a water station that provides filtered water. Overall, the gym is very clean and you use wipes to clean your workout station after the class.

ILKB offers a great intro deal that includes gloves for you to keep. If you decide to sign up long term, it is about $140/month for a 12-month contract and about $160/month for a 7-month contract. Pricey, but I found this cost pretty on par with other places. If you sign up, you get free hand wraps. You can also pay per visit ($16-20 per class).

ILKB offers weekly “Partner perks” where you get a discount at a certain establishment each week if you prove your membership. There are also monthly special events, such as DJ nights.

The only thing that I consider as a negative about ILKB is that the music is super loud. I’m deaf on the right and have to take great care to protect my good ear. If you plan on going often, I would recommend bringing ear plugs to prevent long term hearing damage.

Overall, ILKB is a great place to begin / continue your journey to fitness!</Review>< Pictures>

Some days was hard to get up before the sun comes up just to go to the gym, but when it comes to Ilovekickboxing, I am up and out the door. I feel amazing and each class I feel stronger. Everyone is so nice, supportive, encouraging and the energy is high. The staff is motivating and super nice. The place is super clean. We have so much fun that the time passes by pretty quick! You get a whole body workout, meet new people and have a lot of fun all at the same time :) I look forward to the next class everytime.

ILoveKickboxing Roseville is amazing. I have been a member for about 4 months and the excitement and desire to go to class has not decreased one bit. I love going to class even though it's a crazy tough first 15 minutes of warm up, I fight through it to get to the crazy tough FUN part of bag rounds. The instructors are all super friendly, funny, and motivating and the owners are very nice. All fitness levels are welcome and there is no judgement felt if you have a long way to go. The gym itself is very nice and the locker room and bathrooms are very clean. I'm so happy I found ILKB Roseville. I now have a place to relieve my stress, have fun, and get the best workout! No more boring workouts at the gym for me.<//Review>

ILKB is awesome! Never have I ever sweat so much and enjoyed a workout as I do when I'm working out at the studio. The staff is amazing. A good group of people who make you feel important, and understand your abilities. I was looking for a workout that was going to help me get back into shape after having my 2nd baby. I wasn't noticing a difference on the scale right away but my clothes were all starting to fit better, and I'm happy I'm happy to share that my "pre pregnancy" jeans are back on! I love this gym and the group of supporters I have with me at each and every workout!< /text>

<text>I have been working out for years and have lost a significant amount of weight. It has all been due to kickboxing. The workouts are FULL BODY a** kicking workouts! Cardio, Strength. It is all encompassing. And empowering for me as a woman. I feel stronger with every class! The coaches rock! Motivating, kind, caring and knowledgeable. The owners are pretty awesome too. I recommend this class to ANYONE who wants an awesome workout. Oh and they share info on nutrition too. Just a bonus. :) I cannot say enough great things about Ilovekickboxing. I guarantee if you come in and give it a try you will NOT be disappointed! I Love ILKB! ♥</text><gmapID>0x809b2106fb5031f1:0xbbdd5b68171fcde7< /gmapID>< userid>

ILove Kickboxing Roseville ,is clean and well-organized. This is the place to be when it comes to training and fitness!! Not only is the training exactly what I'm looking for, but the people here are incredible!! With ILoveKickboxing Roseville there was a lot of passion with what the coaches taught us. The technical aspect of the teachings are incredible and you really get a great feel of how things should be done. When I didn't understand I wasn't just pushed to the side, I was given that time to be shown and taught exact technique. Learning basics to hitting a bag, doing drills, and breaking a crazy sweat! . Everyone was so welcoming, and I didn't feel awkward or out of place like I have before. I have never left this place upset or thinking I didn't get something out of it. This is the one and only gym I would recommend to anyone I know. So much fun, and you won't leave here without a shirt soaked in sweat! Everyone here is treat like family with lots of welcome from the staff and the owner< /review>

The warmup at the beginning of the hour gets your heart pumping and the sweat dripping.  On your first day you are set up with a trainer that shows you how to do each move properly so that you get the most out of your workouts and avoid injury.  Everyone, trainers and other members, are always supportive and give a lot of encouragement in class and on social media.  They go the extra mile with things like monthly DJ Nights and charitable contributions.  And, according to my fitbit, I average almost 700 calories burned in each hour of class!  ILoveKickboxing Roseville is definitely worth checking out!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I just signed up with Ilkb Roseville, and have been very impressed! I tracked my work out with my Fitbit and was excited to see how great a workout it was. I had more time in my peak cardio zone than I have had I in the past year combined in just one workout!! What was most exciting was it was a fun engaging work out the whole time, and I never felt like I was in a world of pain to get great results. The gym is very clean and open, all the trainers are bubbly and friendly. I am excited to see where my workout journey will take me now that I have joined Ilkb Roseville.<//review>

I always look forward to working out specially when I have a stressful day at work. ILKB Roseville studio is super clean, the staff members are so cool and friendly plus there's a lot of fun stuff that we do like the DJ month, raffles, helping the community through our check-ins or simply taking a group picture on flex Fridays. It's been two months since I signed up and I've already noticed changes in my body. I love how my flexibility and stamina has improved a lot, I also sleep better at night and I have more energy left to play with my athletic little man after work.

Overall, ILKB is an excellent place to work out, meet new friends and build a community with people who strive to have a strong, healthy and happy life.

If you are looking for a great place to work out + friendly staff+ awesome fitness family, ILKB is the place to be!:)<//Text>< pictures>

I came to this subway for the past two years. Never had an issue until the last few times. There is a really unpleasant employee that I happened to get every time I have gone. I work nearby so this is my go-to-stop every now and again, but today was the last straw. Her energy is very low and unfriendly.

There was a customer in front of me ordering with another sandwich artist, but I got done first. Instead of ringing me out she proceeded to help the next customer in line without letting me know that someone else will ring me up.
I wait until that sandwich artist finishes with his customer and he just starts ringing it up. I have no idea who he is ringing up as I’m right in front of the register, and is talking, but he’s looking down and talking so have no idea who and what he is talking about. Plus my sandwich is off to the side so I literally had to ask him who is he talking too.

Which is fine, whatever I’ll get over it. BUT Just the whole situation was very unpleasant and I proceeded to walk out without paying for anything and without eating. I have never once walked out of an establishment and don’t let things like this bother me, but today and the past incidents got me out of my character.

Needless to say I am never coming back again.

Word of advice: train your employees better for customer service and friendliness.< /text>

<Review>This place is super super ... Stingy with their ingredients.. the portions are not to the price you pay ... I mention it to the manager and the response was the owners don’t want us to give more ... I was amazed I been living in Wilmington 35 years ... I know customer service and this place don’t top it ... just take ur business to the one on Anaheim Street in the city of Wilmington ca get ur money’s worth.< /Review>< Time>

They are super stingy with their ingredients.. I came more than 4xs thinking they would make a change ... and nothing ... I started to go to the one on Anaheim St. Wilmington better service and we’ll serve.<//text>

Horrible never coming here again first a fly stands on my sub and the guy just scares the fly away and tries to keep going on like if nothing happened I told him to make me a new sub and he gives me attitude. Than I asked for a soup the guy puts the container in a bag and sees that the container open and spilled the soup in the bag and wasn't even caring about changing it I had to ask him and once again with his attitude. Not only that he was super slow and didn't even know how to charge he was all confused.  First and last time I come here.<//review>

Why in the world would management have an employee working, who is obviously sick with the flu. This person was coughing a sneezing while making my sandwich..YUCK...I left my half made sandwmiches there and walked out. I later called & spoke to the manager Veronica to ask what is their policy regarding sick employees, well she had no idea!....I'm calling corporate offices tomorrow.</Text>

I would give zero star if I can. The first time I appointed at 2pm but got 10 minutes late. Then they reject service since they said we are late. We appointed another day at 3:00pm and arrived early for 10 min and drop the key and went shopping at Costco. We came back 4:00 later and they said they haven’t start yet. 4:50 they finally start working on my car. What is the point of rejecting service for being late 10 min? This is the worst experience at Costco.<//Text>

The tire price was higher than local offers - but took it since it comes with warranty. But now...
30 minutes, no one takes phone.
ONLINE RESERVATION WORKS WELL.  But why not phone? What will people with no internet knowledge do?</text>

<text>Thank you Josh for breaking our gear lever assembly... we came with a totally functioning car just to change two front tires, and three hours later, they call us because the car couldn’t engage in reverse! No kidding!! They broke it but implied that it was not their fault...! We had to request an incident report to be filled and then we had to chase people around in order to get our copy. No solutions were offered. No apologies were given. It’s a total shame !!!!! We were left there with our half-broken car and had to manage to get home by ourselves.
I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN AND ABSOLUTELY WONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE.<//text>< Date>

Guy looked at my flat and declared it has to be a new tire. On opening it seemed like a smaller problem that can be patched. Not happy about the lack of diligence.

One upside to Costco is the warranty on the tyres. If something goes wrong they refund you.<//text>

<review>Had a flat tire and needed a new tire. Tried to set an appointment on their website but their website did not work. So I tried to phone them but they never answered the phone.  So I went in and stood in a long line. No problem. I paid for the tire and a few days they called me to bring my car in. Again, I tried to call to make an appointment but they never answered the phone.  This time I used a desktop to go to their website and the earliest appointment was September 3, six days from now.  So I just walked in and again waited in a long line. The guy said it would be 3 1/2 hours because I didn’t have an appointment and they’d call me when it was ready. Fine. I waited 4 hours and still no call. So then they said it would be another 1.5 hours before they could get to it. I said “I’ve already waited 5 hours and you said it would be 3 1/2”. The guy responds with a dismissive “we’ve been busy.” Well, so am I.

So then he says appointments get priority. When I asked “how do you make an appointment when you don’t answer your phone?” he says “you’ve got to keep trying.”

You’ve got to be kidding. Never never never never again.  What an insanely frustrating place. You try to do it online but their website drop downs don’t work. Then when you call, they literally never answer the phone.  While you are waiting for them to answer the phone they make you listen to the most annoying loop of instructions. Don’t bother waiting for them to answer, they never will!

I used Costco because I expected it was convenient and a bit cheaper. It was never convenient and if it was cheaper, it was certainly not worth the time I wasted. Horrible experience. Don’t make the same mistake I did. Go somewhere else with a better customer rating.</review>< pictures>

I made an appointment 2 weeks in advance for 4:30. Arrived at the tire center at 4:31, waited in line for 15 minutes (dropped keys off at 4:45). I was told it was going to be 60-90 minutes. Came back at 5:30, car hadn't moved. Was told they would take my car in right away. It's now 6 and they're just getting around to processing my car (haven't moved it to the bay yet). They're estimating another 60+ minutes to actually do the work that should have been done at the appointment time.

Overall, an unpleasant experience and a waste of time.</Review>

Parking was a problem, I was quoted one price, I went back the same day and another person charged me around $30 less not sure why. But with in an hour and a half I had 4 new tires. But I had to take my vehicle to another place for an alignment. It's difficult to get to the tire place because of the long lines of car's gasing up.<//review>

<text>Very nice customer service. There was a long line during memorial weekend.  Some customers are upset. Costco put more mechanics to the front  desk and all of them still show positive attitude. I need to replace a flat tire and they gave me pro-rate credit for rhe old one automatically.< /text>< pictures>

Ok, they had what I needed, a replacement battery for a Kia Sorento, $175, ouch, really, batteries have gone up. The line was pretty slow, doing the lunch run. People were help, just not set up to get you out  quickly.</review>

Came in here because I had a flat tire and also I thought all of my 4 tires needed to be replaced. The guy examined my tires and said I only need to replace the flat one, the rest 3 look good. But Costco doesn’t carry my tire brand, he advised that it’s better to have the same brand of tires on all 4 wheels, so he recommended a couple of tire shops, and even told me to make sure they order the right version, nothing lower, or else it’s a down grade. He was able to help me switch on the spare. I was really happy with the honest feedback and service.< /Text>

Increasing to one more person should make it better. The actual repair or job might be done perfectly but people waiting so long is not acceptable.</Text>< Pics>

Good deal for free tire rotation if you buy the tires from Costco.  Now you have to make appointment instead of just go and wait.< /text>

WORST TIRE CENTER - DONOT visit this Place!

I had a nail in my front tire and got it checked.(After waiting for 45 mins in line) The guy asked me to Buy 2 tires(And btw the one who checked never found the nail and insisted me to Buy tires as he cant Patch the current one - Treads were in CA standards checked it) so we placed the order, but got an tentative appointment for until after the tires will be shipped to store. Firstly the guy asked to me order the tires Online directly saying it gives a cheaper price online.(Trying to avoid work) I still ordered the tires in Store and checked online quickly it was exact same price to the cent as I live in same Zip code. Next morning, the tire pressure was down by 8 points I took the car to GoodYear tires and guess what they patched the same tire for free and said the tires need no replacement and are good for next 2 years. I called costco to cancel the order, they couldn't do it as the order was placed in store, so called the store and they asked me to come in person. I stood in line for another 40-50 mins and they tell me the tires are still NOT shipped and the order can only be canceled once the tires are here. When I asked for manager the desk operator was rude and told me that "HE CANT CALL THE PILOT OF THE PLANE carrying the TIRES for Cancelation." I was surprised with his answer as what does an online order placed in store to do with Tires been shipped by plane/train whatever. I waited and kept requesting for the manager. FINALLY, they decided to give me a REFUND which took 7 Business days to revert and I had to stand in refunds line another 20 mins.

PLEASE DONOT VISIT this STORE. You can try other tire Stores but DEFINATELY DONT GO TO COSTCO TIRES. (As a Premium Member I did not expect this kind of service)</review>

Horrible customer service: I reached the tire center at 2 pm. Waited in line for my turn for 30 minutes. After reaching the counter, they told me that they are not going to take my order because they already have too many orders for the day. They could have told me that on the phone or the moment I walked into their shop. But no, they made me wait 30 minutes in the line and then sent me back. ********!</review>

Same horrible experience as other reviewers. Avoid at all costs! Ordered tires, never got a call or email. System showed as having arrived so I called to find out only two tires had made it to the warehouse days earlier and they had no idea about the other two. ??? Never seen anything like this before.

Booked a "reservation" with them at 3pm. But don't think reservations are honored here. Silently observed when my car gets serviced and it was only after 4:30pm that it got into the working bay. Good news for the people who walk in. Bad news for people who make reservation in the hope for getting a timely service.</text>

I ordered 4 tires online because I had bumps in my tire. The tires arrived on local Costco but they didn't give me a call or even an e-mail. After waiting and driving in fear for 10 days, I called them to learn the tires have been in the warehouse for 10 days. Finally, I lined up in early morning in Costco tire center for an hour to get them installed. They told me, the tires are of the wrong size! They still didn't offer any solution ! After driving with faulty tires for 12 days, my award was a refund! I will never deal with them in the future</review>

After I came here, they told me that I had better to change four tires instead of change only two tires. But, why should I change four tires since my two tires are pretty new. Then I asked them to only change two tires( they told me that my tires are not in stock and I have to order for two weeks). After a week, I came here to repair my tire. Then, I haven't drive for a mile, my car shows that front ties is not in good condition. What a COINCIDENCE. They told me that my another tire is broke just now since I drove out of rode, not even a mile. How do I know if they accidentally broke this tire and didn't tell me after the broke it? I came here ask them, none of them give me a normal face. All of them are like I own them millions dollars. Never came here change tires here again. Even buy tires here, not change in here.< /review>< Name>

<user>108427894577938186722</user>< Review>
Went for a tire repair, charged 10.99+tax nonrefundable fee. 3 hours later told me my tire is unrepairable, need to be replaced. So firstly, they basically did nothing 10.99.

I don't want to pay hundred of bucks for a pair of new tires as my tire is 80% new still. I went to another store later, they charged 45, not cheap, but repaired my tire within 20 minutes, and it works well for 2 weeks already. So secondly, they provide fruad info for my repairable tire, maybe want to sell me a new one.< /Review>

Good service and prices. However, I'm holding out on a fifth star because they don't offer appointments.</Text>

<text>Service takes for ever here. You have to wait and wait and wait until someone comes out to help you.   Very understaffed location.   Even if I go during slower hours,  they have less workers, the wait ends up the same.   Really horrible manager is in control .< /text>< username>

Prices are on par with other locations but free lifetime tire rotation makes it worth it. But arrive early - they open at 7am and people line up at 6:30. After 8, expect a 3-4 hr wait.<//Text>

This is my 2nd time. They can at least take the tyre and repair it next if they have backlog. I’m very disappointed. Please train your employees how they interact with clients. The supervisor was treating me like a kid.</Review>< pictures>

Customer service under 0
5 hours for replace set of the tires.
Don't accept the warranty with the reason beyond the mentioned reasons on the invoice.
Cold and non-friendly staff.</review>

<review>Manager's don't have time sense to provide counter people to service at 7am-9am. So expect to wait atleast 20 minutes per person ahead of you. There are always atleast 4 "Members" ahead of you at 730AM. So If you are planning to get tires replaced even with appointment, take half day off to save $70 on their tires.
Costco membership means person who asked 3rd grade service at costco.Sunnyvale costco tire center is a joke.<//review><pics>None</pics><time>1515180668785</time></record></dataset><record>

<text>Extremely busy place. You always need to wait in the line for more than half an hour to get the service. There are not enough people on the counter. The personnel are slow and typically there is a long time to wait for your car. Don’t just stay here during the tire change.</text>< rate>

<text>I own a small business. I contacted them to fix some plumbing issues we were having. Great customer service by all but especially Taylor. He was terrific. Went above and beyond. When I had issues with my water heater months later I knew who to call. Joe was the first person on site the same day. Super knowledgeable and laid out my options. We ultimately  agreed on a new water heater as my current one was old and needed a lot of new parts to keep it running. This was a big job and it was a big cost but they worked with me on financing and put my mind at ease. Amram, Bryce and Joe were great. Their communication and professionalism during the two days they were on site were incredible. 10 stars!!!!!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>Can’t say anything Good about the technician who came and gave us a bid and did the work and did not resolve any issue that was described. I was left with leaky double wall vent (which is inside our garage and dangerous) and without any heating as this was the issue related. Called them same day, no return, emailed and still no return, called on Saturday and they said Monday someone will contact me for assistance and here I am with a leaky vent pipe which has combustion gases coming into my house if heating is on. And plus cold house. They charge us $1006 and I only went with them cause of the guarantee of this repair would be solving my issue and At the end tech Morgan said this would solve part of the issue and I told him I went with all he recommended and asked 3 times prior to starting the job, if this would solve my issue and the answer was yes. After installed and charged my card, he said this would take care of half of the issue and something extra would need to be done in order to solve the other half. Ended up not solving anything and made it worse and unsafe for me to stay home with the heating system on. My review will stay online until this matter is resolved or money ia returned cause now I also have to fix the cut on the drywall that was made for now reason other than trying to sell and make more on clients. I will wait to hear from this 5 star guarantee service company.

Updating review:
Office called and sent their tech to take a look and found out what was going on. After he came by nothing has been done and the issue is just worse. Found out that where his tech Morgan worked he left the tubes loose and open and air was going directly into the attic and not supplying the house. Over all I have been with the house super cold and not able to get a resolution even after I said that I don’t mind spending the money to have it fix right. But now what I told them after those days is that I want my system the same way it was when they came to work on it. For the last 1 year the system worked much better than after their work; and I requested to make sure they remove their parts installed and leave my system as it was and refund the money cause nothing has worked as expected! Our system has been working okay and we wanted to be great when we hired them, but ended up being worse and now I am with a big problem in my hands and I will have to find someone else to resolve this issue</Text>< Pics>

Blaise was awesome! Always kept his face mask on as well as shoe covers. Did the job quickly and perfectly. Did not leave a mess in the bathroom, quite the contrary. Very pleased with the service. I will definitely use them again if I need plumbing services.<//review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>My toilets tank stopped receiving water and I decided to call a couple places to see what it would be to have it looked at. This place was the first one I called.

They said for $89 they could come out and diagnose the problem and give me an estimate on what it would be to fix it. While I was on the phone with them I found a couple other options for $50 to come out and do the same thing, so I told them thanks, I will think about it and give them a call back. The lady on the phone then told me hold on, let me talk to the manager and I can get that $89 service fee waived, and so I just went ahead and decided to use them.

The guy who came out was great, nice professional etc. He took a look at my toilet and was able to tell me the problem was my corroded shut off valve stopping the water flow and he did this by connecting a feeder hose to see if water was still flowing just somehow being blocked by the valve. He was quick to diagnose the problem and clear on what it was.
Then I asked for an estimate for this repair. It was $400 - the $89 dollar service fee credit which goes toward the repair so it brought my grand total to $311. That price was absolutely outrageous. The part was a $12 dollar part from home depot. All you need is a wrench to remove and replace it. For me to shut off my water, and remove/replace this piece took me 10 minutes. There isnt anything special involved or any fancy special tools required to do this. It was as simple as unscrewing something and screwing the new one on (and shutting off the water before doing this) It is not rocket science. I have no experience with plumbing and I did it myself.

Anyway the 1 start review is because of the insane pricing. $400 for coming over and replacing a 10$ piece? The labor doesn't even take 20 minutes.

Anyway, I told the guy I was just going to fix it myself because $400 is a bit much unless you could bring the price down. He was firm on the pricing, and said its set by management at most he could call and ask but he knows they wont change it so I went ahead and ended up paying the $89 service fee and that was that.

What confuses me is he could of just knocked like 100 off the price and it would of still been outrageous but I'd of done it. I don't know anyone who wouldn't be happy to make over $200 just to screw some part on. As long as its not totally obscence pricing I'd go with it, but less then 20 minutes of basic labor and screwing on a part that costs 12$ at home depot that they carry for $400 is their normal pricing? You'd have to be a complete idiot to go with that.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-ypGI8TCWl7ly7PW5BsCuH9aL2aVr4CkUb0k2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

<Review>We interviewed a number of plumbers and are so pleased that we chose Stevenson Plumbing to do our work for us. They gave us one estimate, there were no surprises or added costs, they spent a good deal of time making sure every detail was perfect before they completed the job. They installed a hot cold faucet on our kitchen sink, along with the hot water dispenser and a new water filter. They were professional, answered all her questions, and were incredibly good humored and positive throughout the whole job. So happy with their work.< /Review><time>1616796746489<//time>< Resp>

<review>Extremely nice on the phone, texted a photo of the serviceman that would arrive. Taylor was genuinely kind and considerate, he explained the situation clearly and honestly, made sure that we understood the cost before he worked. He did a great job, double checked everything and also told us how to prevent drain clog in the future. Payment processing was easy, paperless and had no hidden fees. An honest family owned business. The best plumbing company we’ve worked with in over 15 years living in Vista and Carlsbad. Highly recommended!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Our hot water heater blew and was not detected until late in the afternoon.  My husband called John Stevenson Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning.  They sent Ryan over 15 minutes later to assess the situation, remove the unit and provide options for a new one.  It was amazing how quickly they responded to our emergency!

We also had the chance to meet Alex and Alex, the installers who would be doing the work the following day.  They did an amazing job, even sweeping out the remaining water from the garage.

All staff members were extremely professional, friendly, and took the necessary COVID precautions by wearing masks and maintaining a six foot distance when necessary.  When coming into the house to check the hot water, shoe covers were worn to protect the hardwood floors from getting dirty or wet.

This customer-oriented company did not disappoint us in the least!</text>

<review>Pedro was incredible.  He made sure to call and text prior to arrival and was very prompt.  He made sure to be extra clean and respectful of our space during Covid and performed an incredibly thorough inspection of our system.   He gave us details on the issue as well as the solution to the problem.  He also gave us tips on how to maintain the system in the future.

We loved Pedros attitude and willingness to go above and beyond.

Our drain was stubborn and the first guy called for his supervisor to give him a hand. They did a thorough job and we’d use them again. They were friendly and professional and the price seemed fair for the amount of time spent.</review>

<review>Our water heater gave up on us on the Saturday of President’s Day weekend (of course, a 3 day weekend)...we called John Stevenson Plumbing,  Armando promptly called us back,  and came out to assess our situation. It was nice that he texted us his photo, for security and ID purposes. He quoted us for the work, and he and Taylor were here bright and early Sunday morning to replace the water heater...they were polite, efficient and within hours we again had hot water!! They went over all the workings of our new unit...Armando and Taylor were fabulous, and we highly recommend John Stevenson Plumbing!!<//review>< Pics>

They installed 5 faucets with drains and replaced all under sink plumbing including valves, traps etc. Additionally,  shutoff valve in my garage was replaced in order to regulate water pressure into my home.

The service/sales person was a great communicator. The Sales Manager was responsive and listened and understood our concerns. He addressed them and scheduled the installation. The installers were on-time and very professional. They had to perform some additional minor modifications that were not originally considered. They performed the work at no additional cost. - We’re very satisfied.< /review>

He went above and beyond by scheduling a time for his supervisor to come out with a scope to diagnose any problems that might exist at no extra cost. Taylor took his time to talk about other plumbing issues my recently purchased house might have and gave me tips. Taylor is an excellent technician. I would highly recommend.< /Text>< Pictures>

We have used other large companies in the past, but these people really know what they’re doing and are always so cheerful and personable and able to explain the problem.  They never try to make the problem ours or make excuses, they just do whatever needs done with no complaining about how difficult it is.  Its like having a personal plumber,
and their prices seem fair based on the 5 other companies I’ve worked with.< /text><username>Nancy Rein</username>< resp>

<UserId.>109265073583994802720< /UserId.><Review>I attempted to replace my faucet cartridge by myself. Not sure I had the right tool to push the cartridge in all the way. John Stevenson came over and reinstalled the cartridge correctly. They only charged me the assessment fee instead of the 400 dollars it would cost to replace the cartridge. What a great value and I saved a ton of money to boot! I used these guys to replace my furnace. Their price was cheaper than ASI and Bill Howe!</Review>< Name>

Alex and Amram were fantastic!  They did an extremely professional job replacing our pressure valve, installing a new water purifier and replaced the hot water heater with a tankless system with a descaler.  The lines look very nicely laid out and the system works beautifully.   They took the time to show us everything and explain how the systems work.  We would definitely use them again!</Text>

I noticed my water heater leaking and called John Stevenson and they were very polite on the phone. About an hour later Joseph Wood arrived to inspect my water heater, he said he could have it replaced no problem. Joseph was very professional and knowledgeable and answered all my questions without getting frustrated. I am very happy with the work completed and I will recommend this company in the future.... Thank you Joseph for an outstanding job.</Review>

<review>My experience with John Stevenson Plumbing was great. Our air conditioner stopped blowing cool air in 90 degree weather and I was able to get an appointment within 24 hours! Morgan, the AC Technician, came out to help repair our AC unit and got it done quickly. Throughout the process he politely answered the questions I had and was very professional. Overall I am very happy with the service I received and will be doing business with this company going forward. Thank you.</review>< Name>

I had a clogged outdoor drain and they recommended a hydro jet. I tried to clear it on my own using a variety of methods. Didn’t work.   They unclogged all the roots and flushed out my outdoor drainage system. Works great.  Thank you!  Very professional<//Review>

Someone immediately chatted with me about my needs and I had a call within 30 minutes stating someone would be out to evaluate the problem.  Michael, the drain technician, was polite and knowledgeable and left the bathroom as he found it.  Less than an hour's work and less than half a day from my call and all is running smoothly again.  Very pleased with the entire experience.  Highly recommend this company.<//Review>< Pictures>

Responded same day with a service call to address a leaking water heater one of my rental properties  The technician was Armando and he was excellent and well informed during our on-site q&a.  He replaced the heater in a few hours, showed me options for how to maintain it.  I found their monthly maintenance package to be a good value too as a landlord so I signed up for that as well.  All in all very easy and effective to work with, they will be my go-to for future needs on my properties and I will be requesting Amando for future work.< /review>

I’m not satisfied with the service. The technician installed incorrectly the covers of the unit and he did not put back 5 screws, I found the screws on the floor and needed to disassemble the covers to put them back in the correct way. Really disappointed.</review>

<review>They were very friendly, prompt and professional. However, it was $370 to replace a part in my kitchen faucet. Their service is $$$$ but if you need work done, they’ll be there fast and get it done.< /review>< Date>

<text>Replaced pressure reducing valve for water service line. The technician was extremely polite and respectful.  The job was done in 2 hours and professionally done. Was very expensive. Over $600. Talked to several friends who had theirs replaced by plumbers for 300 to 350. Valve was 110 at home depot. Even if it was 200 through the plumbing service, that puts labor at a little over $200/hr.< /text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I feel that I was fortunate to meet Alex Cose of John Stevenson Plumbing and Heating.  He was able to diagnose a drain problem I have been experiencing for a few months.  Alex was the 3rd plumber to try to diagnose the problem.
Alex Cose was successful.  He used the process of elimination to analyze that my drain was actually part of a community drainage system.  Now I will not have to pay for a service that is actually not my responsibility.   The HOA is responsible which saves me money.  I plan to use John Stevenson Plumbing in the future. The office people are great to deal with and I’m impressed with Alex.   Thank you< /review>

< Review>
Requested an estimate to repair my gas furnace. Stevenson's was prompt and they sent a repairman out the next morning. The inspection was quick and provided a diagnosis of the problem (malfunctioning gas control valve). I subtracted one star from the review because I provided the furnace model number and history of the problem to the person on the phone but that was not related to the repairman. Also, since I had SDG&E come out and perform their free diagnosis, I suspected that the gas control valve was the problem and asked the person on the phone if the repairman would have a replacement for my model of furnace and the reply was "yes, our repair trucks are fully stocked". The actual repairman said that they do not carry control valves and that the part would have to be ordered. Also, the total estimated repair cost of over $1200 (which included installing a sediment trap) was enough to encourage me to replace the valve myself!<//Review>

< review>
We were quoted around $8,000 for services far and beyond what we asked for.  The individual walked through the house telling me how poor the quality is of all items in our three year old home including toilets, sinks, disposals, water tank, hot water heater, etc.
Jarod have me misinformation about items and told me that I should replace several things in my 3-year old home.
We ended up doing the service we called for on our own and in total spent around $60. Further, we cleaned the very parts thy Jarod said were not able to be cleaned.
This individual clearly tried to take advantage of me which demonstrates a total lack of respect for me and your business.  I highly suggest evaluating the process and business philosophy and approach- experiences like this travel fast!</review>

Profession service from the initial estimate to the repair and replacement of parts to greatly improve water flow to shower and tub. I trust their integrity and expertise. Although it was higher priced than a private plumbers estimate, I chose them because I just knew that they would do it right, you get what you pay for. I’ve learned over time that it’s not worth it to cut corners or get the best price. I am glad that I hired them, Brice did an excellent job, and answered all of my questions. I will call them again for future plumbing needs particularly if complicated as this situation was. Very happy with their service, and no, they did not offer me anything of value to leave this review, I just appreciated their excellent and professional care.</text>

This a new review for Armando for my yearly plumbing maintenance. In addition to checking my hot water heater for maintenance, Armando also checked all my plumbing&  water pressure. I received a very informational and much needed feedback from Armando about the status of the plumbing in my home.

I have to tell you my experience with Armando was absolutely wonderful. He was professional, knowledgeable and explained  things to me in a language that I understood and not in” plumbing” language.
In addition he made this a stress-free experience, he has a very engaging and friendly manner in addition to his professional skills. This is the type of employee that every company should have to service the public. Armando knows the true meaning of customer service.

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Alice Lemon<//Name><text>We needed a hose replacement for a handheld shower, and the technicians from John Stevenson told us that the part was not available, and that they would need to make a hole in the wall to install a new elbow in order to replace the hose. The bid was over $500 (not including repairing the drywall). They also indicated that the new part wouldn't match the other parts of the shower, so they gave me additional bids for the rest of the trim kit, and those bids ranged up to  $2000. I thought that was pretty steep, so we had another plumber come, who instantly recognized the part. He had the part the next day and installed it for $40 plus the service call. It seems to me these guys are all about upselling. Beware!< /text><GmapID>0x80dc735b0e021679:0x86970d1b99ed27fb< /GmapID>< user_id>

First off, the technician was extremely friendly, polite and very upfront. I want to make it clear that the technician was great, no issues there whatsoever.  5 Stars!!

BUT.....my only complaint is paying $90 for literally 5 minutes of evaluation. Apparently I need to get into diagnosis business and subcontract it out. At that rate of time and money, you could theoretically make $270 an hour (minus gas money and travel time of course).  Unreal.  Minus a star for being expensive AF.  My time is definitely worth the quoted $841 to swap a part out.</Review>

Used ac for first time this year-blowing air but not cold. Called another company but would have to wait a week. Called this company at 230-came that day by 3! Compressor dead and another part replaced. Paid for parts, labor and he cleaned out the unit. Technician was professional and knowledgeable. Super glad we got it taken care of before the real heat expected the next few days!
Worth the money paid!!!<//Review>

<review>Jordan very nice and helpful and did the job quickly. I was given an arrival time of 12-4 pm, but plumber arrived at 4:45. They did call twice to keep me updated, however.  The prices were kind of high for a simple clogged drain.  The appointment setter needs to be a little more honest about the pricing.  I was quoted 89 for a service call, which would be applied to the work, and she said just one clogged drain wouldn't be much more than that.  It was $270 altogether.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1595517617501, 'text': "Good Morning Donna,\nThanks for taking the time the provide us with some honest feedback!

After charging me an outrageous price of over $560.00 to reset the toilet, Jehemia, the technician did not finish the job. He told me he did me a favor by putting the toilet seat on. In addition,  he did not cover the bolts that were sticking up or remove the old toilet. I called the office and was told there was nothing I could do and no manager to speak to. The lack of customer service was appalling.  Do not use them<//Text>

I'm not usually one to put reviews out there.  But, I just had to since I am so impressed.  This is a shout out to Jordan.

I recently had another plumbing contractor come out from a different company and tell me I need to replace the sewer pipe since it was cracked.  This was going to set me back about $5k.  Long story short, something just seemed off about this guy and the whole situation.  There was too much bragging and story-telling.  So, I got a 2nd opinion and Jordan came out on time with a smile and gave me the real story.  No new pipe needed.  Just break up the concrete a little bit around the pipe so that it has some wiggle room.

I just moved into this house a few months ago and need to tune up a few things around here.  Let's just say that John Stevenson will be my go-to for ALL things plumbing...heating...& A/C in the future.  I am so happy I found a great company I can do business with that I trust will do the right thing.</Text>

<user_name>Bill Bashor<//user_name><text>The technicians were very polite and professional, the work great.  They took care of the leak with no issue.  It was the price, a three hour plumbing fix shouldn’t cost as much as a  major transmission repair, although the work was great, I’ll neither call them again nor recommend them to family or friends.< /text>< userid>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>CUSTOMER BEWARE...The reason for the 1 star is that the technician was very polite, professional.  The reason it’s only one star is that they were provided the name of our reverse osmosis system, said they could assist, so we felt ok with it.  THEN, the tech arrived, said they couldn’t service it and then proceeded to sell us on a whole home system, as well as other services they provide.  AND THEN CHARGED US FOR THE VISIT.  They did note that the visit would incur a charge, but when we provided the name of the system prior to the tech visit and our need they claimed they can help, so we felt comfortable scheduling the service.  Totally false pretense. BEWARE.<//Text>< Pics>

When we spoke over the phone, we agreed that one of our technicians would be able to service your sink's reverse osmosis system. After he arrived and did an evaluation of the system, he informed you that we would have to order various parts for that particular repair. He then mentioned that we do offer a whole-home filtration system, which would have filtered water running throughout all of your household faucets and fixtures. We were happy to help, but needed additional parts to service the sink and our technician believed installing a whole-home filtration system would be in your best interest.

Alex & Taylor came to the rescue cause of our water heater finally died. We decided to go with tankless water heater. Alex was very knowledgeable and helped us choose a right tank for our household. He was also will very professional and did a great job explaining everything and cleaning up after. Will definitely use them again for the flow tech and water softener system in the near future. Thank you guys!< /Review>

I really appreciated the local family-owned, really super efforts to do the replacement the same day.  About 6 hours of effort; one removing and preparing everything for the really talented guy that was on another big job that came to do the replacement and final work.

Thanks to all of you for a really fantastic job.

Brian was a very thoughtful and helpful person,  he found the problem with my ac unit very quickly and let me know what he needed to do. I found him very pleasant to talk with concerning caring for my unit and explained the reasons why the problem may have occurred.  He also let me know about options with the company I could purchase at low cost to help care for my ac unit. I would recommend this company to family and friends for thier heating and air.< /Text>

John Stevenson plumbing was an answer to prayer.  Tuesday night our water heater quit working! 8:00 pm, in the middle of the covid 19!  I called this amazing company, sorry I don't remember the sweet young lady answering the phone, who said we would be serviced the next day.  Asked all the safety health questions, and Ryan arrived the next morning 8:30am.  Ryan was masked, gloved, and as we are seniors, appreciated the social distancing.  Answered all our questions, gave us great advice,  had Mike and Dave here following  all safety guideline within an hour . Fast,  efficient, polite and as they had to remove and replace the dryer to install the water heater,. No problem for them!  My husband and I could not have been more pleased and would highly recommend this company!  Thank you John Stevenson and company.   Be blessed<//Text>

<Review>Everything went well except we believe for cleaning out my condense pipe that was under sink in bathroom for 1 hour was 581.10 was extremely expensive. Could have done it myself if told.  Professional and polite service with Pedro, however was not very clear about how he will fix it. (Not enough info.) 1day later after he was here our air conditioner is not cold now. Pedro should have checked everything. We will be calling another company to come out. (Very disappointed).</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Very fast even on weekends. Very professional.
Fast callback when I had a new issue.
We will definitely call them back if we need plumbing issues resolved again.
I had called many places on Saturday for a faucet leak. Most couldn’t come out till Monday.
David was here within 45 minutes.
A great company!  I highly recommend them!</text>

<review>Needed a plumber to replace my washing machine water valves before a new machine could be installed.
Ryan Solis from John Stevenson Plumber’s came out. He did superb work. Fast and efficient but more than that he was honest and friendly. Made me feel like I had been a client of her s for years. Not a customer he just met. I will use this company again and again and tell my friends who own homes also about them Because of Ryan!!< /review>< pictures>

Had a really great experience. They came out within 20 minutes of me calling and requesting their help and we’re very friendly and reasonable with their pricing and services. I was surprised how reasonable their pricing was knowing that plumbing can be an expensive service to ask for. I would recommend calling early in the morning if you need them to come out quickly.<//review>

He called before he arrived and arrived exactly when he said he would.

Our company only offers upfront, flat-rate pricing and we did perform a diagnostic check for your water heater for $39. We also presented to you multiple pricing options for a water heater repair or installation, but explained that replacing your entire water heater would be the best option since any repairs to the unit would just be a temporary fix. We also explained that the repair we offered for $223 will not solve all of your water heater issues but you still insisted we go through with the repair. We understand that our pricing doesn't meet all of our clients needs, however we did our best to inform you that replacing your unit would be the best solution.

He tried two different size snakes, the bigger one was able to unclog whatever was in the pipe. What Mike doesn't know is that I had called another plumber earlier in the day and he was not able to unclog the drains. The other company claimed that I needed to dig up the pipes for repair,  that it's not an easily fixed issue ($4200). Always get a second opinion! So thankful I found an honest company.

We recently had a roof that leaked which originally presented itself by a leak from the A/C Duct.  I called John Stevenson Plumbing and let them know there was a leak in my duct and they sent someone out immediately.  Carter arrived in a timely manner and confirmed that the leak wasn't from the duct and said it was from our roof.  He even went into our attic to confirm the leak was from the roof and took pictures and video which was helpful for our insurance claim.

We then decided to have a toilet installed and some duct work done since the furnace had to be removed. Everyone who worked on that project (Armando, Brian, Ryan, Nate and John) were all extremely professional and did a great job!  I cannot recommend John Stevenson Plumbing enough.  They always go above and beyond in their service.< /text>

So here's how they do business.  On a clogged shower - they wanted $90 to come out and inspect.  Not a problem - I wasn't interested.  They called me back and said they'd come out and inspect it for $30 and give me a bid.

I asked what the normal price for a shower clog was - they couldn't say.  I asked - just give me a ballpark.  They still couldn't say.

So I fell for it and had them come out for $30 to give me a bid.  The guy was quick to come out - which was nice, but the $244 bid to unclog a shallow shower clog was way too high.

I especially dislike their method of not disclosing any prices until after they are on the premises and you're already in to them for a few bucks.

I'd rather pay someone else who can give me a number up front - instead of the somewhat slimey methods they use.<//text>

Our technicians choose to give our customers options based on their specific plumbing issues, which is why we require an in-person evaluation rather than providing any "ballpark" pricing over the phone. In most cases, over-the-phone estimates are inaccurate, especially since a technician isn\'t able to thoroughly inspect a customer\'s home system and develop a correct diagnosis. It saddens us to know that you were disappointed with our pricing system.

I had a great experience with your company. Joseph Wood was our assigned agent. He was very professional, knowledgeable and quickly identified our problem. Although the problem was rather minor, he explained it thoroughly while making the appropriate fix. And all for a decent price. A not normally communicated element to my confidence in Joseph was how clean and organized his truck was! I have not plumbing skill, but can feel more or less confident is someone who keeps his workspace tight and orderly. Cudos to him for that!!  I will definitely use you again.< /review>

Pedro was great and was able to clean up my current AC enough to make sure it will keep humming through the summer. It is very old, so he suggested I look at what it would take to get a new system vs. pouring a bunch of money into a 27 year old unit.

We had a new furnace installed 16 months prior by John Stevenson and the furnace quit recently.  I called and they sent a service tech over right away.  He replaced a part and it was no charge.  Tom was very cordial, quick and neat.  And best of all, the furnace worked again.

Nice going!</text>

These people are amazing and wonderful.  At 5:00 p.m. on a Friday before the Labor Day weekend, our air conditioning went out.  It was hot and we have a week-old baby in the house.  I called my usual service company and got a recording.  Based on their Google review, I called John Stevenson Plumbing, Heating & Air.  Not only did I get a live person (she was sympathetic and understanding -- a young mother herself), I got an immediate response.  Within 15 minutes, I got a call from Juan explaining that the tech had one call before ours but would be there within two hours.  True to his word, their tech, Pedro, showed up at 7:00 p.m.  Not only did he fix the air conditioning, he made several helpful suggestions on how to avoid problems in the future.  He was skilled, professional and very kind.

I am beyond grateful to these people.  My experience with John Stevenson Plumbing, Heating & Air was everything a homeowner could want: responsive, respectful and reasonably priced.  They are now my "go-to guys".  I recommend them wholeheartedly.<//Text>

The two men that replaced a copper plumbing pipe for my mobile home were very professional and concerned. It was a very hot day but they  pushed through and explained what they did.  I was told I may need a new water heater soon, and I also have some issues with other piping serving my little home.  I appreciated their input and information.  My leak seems corrected now and I am thankful.  Thank you.</text>

Nice tech.  I really liked him, but he didn't identify the problem correctly.  That being said, I paid the $79, but still had a clogged sink.  However, I was given proposals ranging from $355 to $1800 to take care of the problem, which was not identified.  I was told I needed to have the latter work done.  Before I would allow that, I called for a second opinion.  The other plumber came, quickly assessed the problem and I had the clog resolved in less than an hour at a reasonable price.  Would have been even better if I hadn't had to pay Stevenson $79 for nothing.  Stevenson's tech had everything wrong from the direction the pipes flowed out to the sewer and work needed to correct it.  What really compounds this issue is that the tech was out 3 different times.  I had to live with a plugged sink for several days.  Nice people but perhaps more training is needed< /Text>

The first appointment kept being delayed to the point that I had to reschedule. The technician was very nice but quoted me $1180 to clean the outside drains using hydrojet. He then told me if I could get a neighbor to also use the service on the same day, the price would be $800 each. He told me the price was set by the industry. I called around and ended up getting the same service from another company for $375 which included a free camera inspection.<//Text>

I had a faucet handle that broke off and some of the hoses were leaking. I called and asked for a technician to come out and change my faucet. The technician was really kind and informative but ended up looking at the water heater. Next thing I know he is trying to sell me a new water heater and a membership service.

He ended up doing a temporary fix and told me after being at my home for an hour that he didn’t have time to actually repair my faucet and that he would return Monday to fix it. 2 hours later I was showing someone what was done and come to find out the hoses were still leaking.

After a couple YouTube videos I figured out how to fix the issue myself and now the company wants me to pay the diagnostic fee. I offered to pay half since the job was not complete and the technician technically didn’t even temporarily fix the problem.  Jose is extremely rude and likes to threaten your credit and everything else he can. But this is strictly about trying to up sell. It’s an unfortunate situation but I would think that a unsatisfied customer offering to pay half would be something the company would be happy with considering my water pressure also went down after the technician was at my home.< /text>

<Review>They installed a new water heater a year ago at my daughter’s condo, and called to schedule a one year checkup. At the same time we scheduled a furnace check up. 2 separate technicians came, both were great and helpful. The heating tech showed us a few minor things that were issues, but suggested waiting until the unit dies( it is 19yrs old) rather than spending $$$ to fix minor issues. The honesty is greatly appreciated.
I will definitely recommend them to friends, and will use them at my house as well.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>These guys KNOW what they’re doing.   Pedro came out and we discovered the company that installed our system originally was missing a couple of parts we never knew were missing. The other company also installed our system incorrectly so that the water was backing up into our system . It’s going to cost quite a bit to correct these items. Hopefully it didn’t damage the condenser otherwise we will have to replace the entire system .   It’s not worth it to find a cheaper company to install your system.  I wish we would’ve went with John Stevenson from the start.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Last September 2018 I moved into my new home in Carlsbad.   I needed to accomplish some major upgrades including installing air conditioning, a tankless water heater and a gas line for my new gas range.   After meeting with the representatives from John Stevenson I chose them to do the work.   This year I needed to replace the heating system due to its age and needed repairs.    From my first meeting and all subsequent work performed by the company’s staff I am very impressed with their level of professionalism, quality of work, friendliness, patience and above all, their helpfulness!    It’s a comfort to know they are so trustworthy as I am a 73 year old senior citizen!

The wonderful staff included Carter, Andrew, Joe, Alex and Tom!< /text>

They were fast and professional however their prices are significantly higher than all the other plumbers in Carlsbad. I would never have had them come out and waste $39 for a quote if i had known they were going to quote me double the next highest plumber. $2,900 to replace a 40 gallon water heater is absurd.  Only use them if you are stuck and have no other options. Nice people though.<//text>

Our technician, Alex was very helpful and courteous.  He contacted me almost immediately after talking to the answering service. He arrived within the time he had specified..  That was greatly appreciated. He's wonderful.
The only negative would have been the price charged, $511.00.  I could understand the $189 because it was on a Sunday but the remaining cost seemed way too high for 20 minutes of work.  But I guess that's the going rate for plumbing these days...
If I had time I would have compared prices with other companies..< /Review>

1st time using John Stevenson Plumbing. A friend referred me to them and I’m really grateful. I was able to get an appointment on the same day as my call and they showed up on time. Bryce helped us quickly and efficiently and was really awesome. I’ll definitely be using JSP again in the future!!<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>We had our Water Heater go out over the Fourth of July weekend.

After determining that it was still under warranty we had to go through a few extra steps to get a replacement. Joe, the Field Supervisor took extraordinary measures to get us back up and running by mid-day on Saturday.

Joe was professional, courteous and efficient. He went that “extra mile” and it was greatly appreciated.

We won’t hesitate to use them again and recommend John Stevenson Plumbing to our family and friends!

Two very capable and professional men arrived on time and worked on seven different plumbing issues I had as I ready my home to sell. They arrived early and worked until 4:00pm with a half hour break to get some lunch (at my urging). The faucets, garbage disposal, shower heads, valves and all parts and pieces of my plumbing are perfect now. And, they cleaned up after themselves better than I do...including vacuuming.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>First, I located John Stevenson plumbing online and found that they had very reasonable rates.  Setting up an appointment was a breeze and I was given a 2 hr time window, 30 minutes from the time I called (perfect!).  They then phoned me when the specialist was 30 minutes away.  Jason arrived exactly on time, neat and clean with a great attitude.  He got to work immediately and unclogged my kitchen drain.  Then, per my request, he scoped the pipe with camera and explained to me what the condition of the pipe was.  I'm an engineer and I love to talk tech - which can be a bit much for some people.  Jason listened attentively and helped me understand more about my plumbing.  I really appreciate that.  I will definitely use John Stevenson again and I will recommend this company (and Jason!) to my neighbors.  Keep up the great work and thanks again!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

First of all, I'm not dissatisfied with the repair job that was performed. I am not happy with the flat rate charge that I paid. I showed the technician where the leak was and had the area exposed for ease of repair. The job entailed replacing two feet of copper pipe and adding two couplers. The same type of repair was done about a week ago, but was under the mobile home. The repair tech had to find the leak and do the repair in some muddy area. That job cost me about $130. Granted that the second repair was done on a Saturday and I expected to pay a weekend rate, but not $503. Well,  I should be more careful who I contract with.<//Review>

It is with great pleasure that we write these words to let everyone know how impressed we are with the services of John Stevenson Heating and plumbing. We installed three indoor mini splits and a heat pump on the roof. Mr Brian Shockley has been extremely professional, courteous, punctual and attentive to all details and needs. The installation was complicated and Brian took care of every detail. The equipment is very quiet, the electric cables are perfectly organized and tidy.  We are pleased having nice cool air and heating when we need it. Thanks Brian for your knowledge and your work ethic. Our experience with John Stevenson and Brian has been beyond our expectations. I would recommend John Stevenson to anyone in the city that needs heating, cooling and plumbing services. I look forward to having your company service our equipment when need it. Again thanks, RObert and Gina Ing</Text>

<Review>I can't even give them one star!  I called  John Stevenson plumbing to have someone come out and add a blower to our fireplace.  When I called in the women on the phone said let me make sure we provide that service, when she got back on the phone she said YES we do provide that service and when would you like to schedule.  I set the appointment for 3 weeks out.  TODAY I GET A CALL, THEY  ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OUT TOMORROW AND THEY CALL ME TELLING ME THEY CAN'T MAKE IT THEY HAVE AN ALL DAY JOB today and it will run into tomorrow and wanted to reschedule for next week.  When I told Juan NEXT WEEK DOESN'T WORK FOR ME. he said "well you know I don't even know if we do that kind of service" WHAT LET'S SEE YOU WANTED TO RESCHEDULE AND THEN YOU SAY AFTER I CAN'T RESCHEDULE YOU SAY OH WE DON'T DO THIS  SERVICE! WHAT IS IT? And remember this is after the girl on the phone double checked to make sure they provide the service.  GOOD LUCK IF YOU CHOOSE THEM TO DO ANYTHING CHANCES ARE THEY WON'T SHOW!  i WOULD OF GIVEN THEM A FEW STARS HAD THEY GIVE ME ANY KIND OF NOTICE! WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.. CALL SOMEONE ELSE!</Review><userid>107062703941792548283<//userid>< pics>

Pedro came out to do a air conditioner check up and he also reviewed the furnace and made sure both were in good repair. He had a long term recommendation and explained what I need to do and why when I replaced the furnace but he didn't try and sell me a new system since mine is still in good shape even after 19 years. I feel like I can trust their recommendations to be best for me as the customer not what makes them.the most money. Thank you for your honesty.<//Text>

<Time>1564190735479<//Time><Text>Great company.  My A/C was out yesterday, called them the next am and the repair person was out that same day.  Heat wave in San Diego.  I was surprised by the very quick service, because all the A/C guys are very busy right now.

Found a short in a wire and fixed it immediately.  The unit is 20 years old.

My previous experience with this company was also positive.  They repaired 2 twenty year old high-end Jado shower valves that 2 other plumbers told us could not be repaired.

In the past, they also cleaned out our outside and inside A/C units including filters at reasonable cost.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This is the best service experience I think i have ever had.  Alex the plumber who came out was thorough, helpful and knowledgeable.   The value has been extensive and I am very pleased.  The answering service had told me I was out of their service area but Alex called back and said he could come over right away.  Awesome</text>

Thank you for taking care of us and repairing our AC unit.  The company was prompt to send out a technician and let me know who would be arriving and at exactly what time so I would not have to waste half a day waiting.  The problem was diagnosed quickly by Thomas and he even kindly waited for me as I made a last ditch effort to call the manufacturer about any warranties.  Cost to fix was higher than I’d like but it includes service 3 times during the year for heating or other air units.  I especially liked how the company sent a pic and bio of the technician doing the service so I know a little about who I’m letting inside the house.  Thank you for being professional and working quickly to resolve and repair the problem.</review>

The office staff and technicians were all courteous, helpful and professional. Travis eased my worries with a correct diagnosis of  the problem at my elderly mother’s home over the phone on the weekend. Ryan confirmed the problem on Monday and completed the necessary repairs with great efficiency, keeping me apprised of the work by phone throughout. If it weren’t for some glitches with scheduling, this would have been a 5-star review. I will definitely use them again!</Text>

Jeremiah was awesome and came through in a clutch! I highly recommend John Stevenson plumbing. They helped with a gas line for the oven, new water heater, and we’re extremely responsive with a broken shower valve that required the water to be shut down throughout the entire building. Thank you for the help!<//Review>

Brian and the crew were all extremely knowledgeable about the products they were installing and what they needed to do to make temperature control in my 2250 sq.ft. ranch style house more comfortable and efficient without a complicated system.  Very impressed with the quality of work these guys did especially in the running and the installation of the new duct work.  I think John Stevenson pricing is fair, and although not cheap, a good value because in working with contractors I believe you get what you pay for and if I'm happy with the work it's always money well spent.  I have also used this local Carlsbad company for a plumbing repair in the past and was very satisfied with the work for that as well.  I found all the staff I came in contact with from the appointment scheduler Peg and everyone who answered their phones to the installation crew all very professional and responsive people who seem to really care about their company and their customers.  As a homeowner of an older home it's nice to have a go to company for plumbing, heating and air concerns!< /Review>< name>

Had a water leak and after calling around, John Stevenson plumbing was the only one who could get to me immediately; which I needed because I was leaving town in 7 hours. Ryan Solis came out and couldn’t have been more professional, polite and personable while still doing a very thorough repair job. It wasn’t cheap but the work was done quickly and efficiently to get our household back in business. Peg, who was my initial contact point, was super nice as well and made sure someone got to my house quickly and followed up to let me know Ryan was on the way.</Text>

<Text>Hired them to do a full HVAC replacement including duct work...Brian did a great job specifying exactly what units and duct rework we needed and did not try to sell me anything I didn't need...the installation crew of Tyler, Andrew and Nick did an amazing job removing the old stuff and installing a new furnace, new a/c unit and new duct work that is now 100 times better than what I had up in my attic for the last 15 years!  Brian and the crew were all extremely knowledgeable about the products they were installing and what they needed to do to make temperature control in my 2250 sq.ft. ranch style house more comfortable and efficient without a complicated system.  Very impressed with the quality of work these guys did especially in the running and the installation of the new duct work.  I think John Stevenson pricing is fair, and although not cheap, a good value because in working with contractors I believe you get what you pay for and if I'm happy with the work it's always money well spent.  I have also used this local Carlsbad company for a plumbing repair in the past and was very satisfied with the work for that as well.  I found all the staff I came in contact with from the appointment scheduler Peg and everyone who answered their phones to the installation crew all very professional and responsive people who seem to really care about their company and their customers.  As a homeowner of an older home it's nice to have a go to company for plumbing, heating and air concerns!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

JOE WOOD Came out and greeted me with a handshake and a smile.  Very professional, honest, and thorough.  He quickly diagnosed the water heater problem and patiently talked about several options from tank-less to traditional 40g tank.
JOE was honest about both options and didn't try to push us toward a specific option. He assured us that either choice would satisfy our water needs.
Once the work started JOE flowed smoothly through the process and talked to me about what he was doing and why he was doing it.  His knowledge of the trade will put you at ease as you will know a PROFESSIONAL is doing the work as apposed to your "friend who knows a guy."
When the work was done JOE explained everything he did and why he did it.
He left with a handshake and a smile.  Very professional and a great representative of the company.

Alex Cose was great...gave me three options with three levels of pricing.  A very simple, basic fix, another that included definite upgrades, and another that had those and one additional feature.  I chose the middle option.  Alex just went about his job and completed it in a prompt and professional manner.  John Stevenson Plumbing and Heating can be assured Alex is representing the company in a way that will cause your clients to call you back when they need your services.

Thank you,

Very pleased with the service received from Jeremiah with John Stevenson Plumbing, Heating and Air.  Jeremiah performed initial services to address a broken shower valve and provided several alternatives that would provide more permanent fix.  Upon selection of preferred alternative, he assisted with ordering of needed parts and scheduling or additional repairs.<//Review>

My toilets tank stopped receiving water and I decided to call a couple places to see what it would be to have it looked at. This place was the first one I called.

They said for $89 they could come out and diagnose the problem and give me an estimate on what it would be to fix it. While I was on the phone with them I found a couple other options for $50 to come out and do the same thing, so I told them thanks, I will think about it and give them a call back. The lady on the phone then told me hold on, let me talk to the manager and I can get that $89 service fee waived, and so I just went ahead and decided to use them.

The guy who came out was great, nice professional etc. He took a look at my toilet and was able to tell me the problem was my corroded shut off valve stopping the water flow and he did this by connecting a feeder hose to see if water was still flowing just somehow being blocked by the valve. He was quick to diagnose the problem and clear on what it was.
Then I asked for an estimate for this repair. It was $400 - the $89 dollar service fee credit which goes toward the repair so it brought my grand total to $311. That price was absolutely outrageous. The part was a $12 dollar part from home depot. All you need is a wrench to remove and replace it. For me to shut off my water, and remove/replace this piece took me 10 minutes. There isnt anything special involved or any fancy special tools required to do this. It was as simple as unscrewing something and screwing the new one on (and shutting off the water before doing this) It is not rocket science. I have no experience with plumbing and I did it myself.

Anyway the 1 start review is because of the insane pricing. $400 for coming over and replacing a 10$ piece? The labor doesn't even take 20 minutes.

Anyway, I told the guy I was just going to fix it myself because $400 is a bit much unless you could bring the price down. He was firm on the pricing, and said its set by management at most he could call and ask but he knows they wont change it so I went ahead and ended up paying the $89 service fee and that was that.

What confuses me is he could of just knocked like 100 off the price and it would of still been outrageous but I'd of done it. I don't know anyone who wouldn't be happy to make over $200 just to screw some part on. As long as its not totally obscence pricing I'd go with it, but less then 20 minutes of basic labor and screwing on a part that costs 12$ at home depot that they carry for $400 is their normal pricing? You'd have to be a complete idiot to go with that.</text>

We had some nasty backed up drains that needed clearing so we called this company because we had called them in an emergency last year and had been very satisfied with their prompt services the last time. Unfortunately we didn’t take the time to give them a positive review the last time so we thought we’d try them again. Well it wasn’t a fluke folks. This time around Jason P. came out and starting with the booties he put on at the door, to the clear estimates, and the respectful way he spoke to both my elderly mother and me made it a pleasure having him in our home. We will definitely using them on future projects.< /Text>

I am recovering from surgery and my husband is disabled. I can't thank the Stevenson's team enough for their friendly service and expertise.  We had originally had an appointment which I had to cancel because of a death in my family.  We ended up buying a refrigerator but discovered the water line had a major leak. I called them and spoke with Kate (who was very helpful and friendly) and she was able to send Alex to at least turn off the water. Joe & Jeremiah showed up a short while later and went above and beyond - reworking the connections so they were correct.  I won't use anyone other that John Stevenson's to work on my house! Thanks so much guys.<//Review>

<text>Just had a plumbing consult from Travis, and he was wonderful! He was quick, efficient, knowledgeable, and pointed out a couple VERY important issues with our sinks/water heater. Super friendly and helped “dumb down” the plumbing talk so I could understand what needed to be done. There was no pressure at the end of the consult to purchase any products, but we will definitely be calling them to do our replacements! Such a great company, and I would highly recommend requesting Travis as your consult technician.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Showed up on time, spent almost two hours checking. Then tried to sell me more ducting, air returns and ultimately $399. for coolant. The problem wasn't fixed and I called in another company. The problem was an incorrectly scheduled nest thermostat.
It took five minutes to reprogram.  When the unit turned itself off and then started fine twenty minutes later the thermostat should have been checked.
This was very unprofessional and poorly executed.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Just had John Stevenson Plumbing come out last night after hours. We had a terrible RECURRING problem that never got address by the previous plumbing company. We spend THOUSANDS of dollars on fixing this problem SEVERAL times before and now that we used John Stevenson Plumbing, they identified our problem immediately. On top of that, they showed us how this is not the responsibility of our business but that of the management company. They took pictures and videos as evidence. These guys are great! Highly recommend. Plus their prices were VERY reasonable!</text>

John Stevenson Plumbing was the second plumber I called. First, I tried our regular plumber, but they wanted to charge me their "after-hours" rate at 3:30 in the afternoon and couldn't get anyone here for at least 2 hours. Forget that! I had an active leak I couldn't stop.

When I called JSP, they not only said they would be charging their daytime prices, but they don't charge by the hour--they charge by the job, by what actually needs to be done. Refreshing! Then they had a plumber here in less than 30 minutes, and he was the Field Supervisor, no less.

He was friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. He gave me an estimate, including a new-client discount of about 10%, and explained what he was going to do. We had a whole new pressure regulator and shutoff valve in about an hour! He cleaned up the space, gave us some helpful recommendations for avoiding future leaks, a quick tutorial on turning off the water at the street (which I couldn't figure out how to do before), how to bleed air out of the water lines, and was on his way.

Highly recommended!</review>

Had my backed sewage cleared out in recorded breaking speeds, all the while answering any and every question I had.  Told me the best ways to prevent myself from walking in my own fecal matter and how to keep everything flowing smoothly. Will definitely recommend him to family, friends and anybody that needs a professional plumber!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

John Stevenson Plumbing was a great find. I called bc my heater stopped working and had never had an HVAC service done before. They were extremely friendly and immediately offered me the $39 inspection, which for me made all the difference! It removes the barrier and worry associated with a potentially major service. Wishing 2 days, Brian, the technician came out and immediately identified the issue. He even offered to come back the next day, which was a Saturday, to install the new part. He was experienced and very professional and i now feel a high degree of trust and loyalty to Brian and John Stevenson Plumbing and Heating!
I would highly recommend this company and especially Brian. I am grateful for the great service all around! Robin Selitsch</review>

I probably called 10 different 24/7 plumbing services today and John Stevenson was the most prompt.  Ryan came to help us and he was great.  He explained in detail the issue, showed us the parts and exactly what he was doing to repair it. The repair was very clean and thorough, afterwards it was like the issue was never there. Great peace of mind!<//review>

John Stevenson Plumbing was able to place us on a high priority list to come out for inspection and repair.
Jason and Jordan (and Juan in the office) kept in constant contact with me through text to keep me informed about their scheduling and ETA.
Jason and Jordan were friendly, knowledgeable, quick, considerate, and had good advice to share.
They represented their company well and I am definitely leaning towards using John Stevenson Plumbing more.<//text>< Pictures>

I am very excited about my new tankless water heater system and Flow Tech water filtration/ anti scale installed by Joe at John Stevenson Plumbing.   The installation was done in one day with impeccable quality and work standards.  So long 75 gallons of hot water sitting in my garage.     I look forward to many years of clear water and efficient service from this product.  So wonderful to have the saved space in my garage and let go of the worry from a holding tank of water.   Thank you John Stevenson Plumbing, you have responded great to all my needs the past four years.< /Text>

Couldn't write a better review! I called about a clogged toilet and Jason was at my house within an hour. And mind you this wasn't an emergency ;) He was polite, courteous, thorough, and knowledgeable. I would call Jason to come out again in a heartbeat. He is my go-to now :) Thanks for a great job Jason! Having a plumbing issue is, well, yucky and you made the experience easy! 5 - stars for John Stevenson Plumbing - Heating - Air
UPDATE 9-2018 called again for a kitchen drain issue. Jason was at my house within 1 hour of my call. Fixed the problem easily and quickly. 5 stars once again :)</review>

After trying to deal with a stubborn clog in my bathroom we called John Stevenson Plumbing.  Alex, the plumber, was polite, professional, courteous, and explained everything he was doing.  And he got the sink draining in record time, all for $79.  If the drain clogs again within 30 days, we get one free visit to re-snake the pipe.  I highly reccomend John Stevenson Plumbing!< /Text>

Ryan was an excellent technician. I was very pleased with the communication and explanations for all the work done.
To be Frank, I ended up paying far more than I originally anticipated but I felt very comfortable with the outcome. That typically doesn't happen when blindsided by extra cost. I will definitely use these guys again. And again, Ryan is a heckuva technician.< /Text>

<text>I called in a panic at 3:15 concerning a leaky toilet all over the floor.  Someone was at my house within 30 minutes. He looked like an angel to me.
He went  right into the bathroom, diagnosed  the problem, fixed it, cleaned up his mess and was out the door within 40 minutes. The price was very reasonable.

<Text>We were in a tough spot. Called for service for air and broken pipe and air condition service. My in-laws were at home to receive the service people. The plumbing work was not done very well and I believe it was VERY VERY expensive for the work they did.  My wife and I returned home to a hole in the wall (they did have to cut to get to the pipe) BUT---the hole was not cut well or evenly. The air condition is working, they said the overflow shuts down the thermostat... $600 bucks seems high for the issue?!!?</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Name>Jason Richardson< /Name>< rating>

We pride ourselves on always providing our customers with a five star quality work/service and we are sad to hear that this was not what you feel you received. After looking into your account and the work that was completed we stated in the invoice that was sent to you we would need to cut an opening into the stucco, approximately a 6” square and would need to repair the broken section 1/2” copper pipe. We replaced about five inches of copper and added a new thread on your hose bib. No leaks were found after the work was completed and everything was intact. After diagnosing your AC unit, we found the unit to be off from an over flow from condensate drain lines being plugged. We cleared the lines and installed a secondary safety switch, the other safety switch was soaked from the over flow. We tested the lines after clearing to ensure that it drained as it should.\nWe understand that we are not the right company for everyone. We will never cut corners or take short cuts that could compromise the quality of our work. We cannot offer the same level of service our customers deserve and expect at the same rates as companies who are cheaper. We understand that we will not be a match for everyone, but our goal is to provide the best value for your money by giving the best service, upfront pricing, and quality of work, not to be the lowest priced company out there. We truly appreciate your feedback, please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nThank you,'}</Resp></record>

I was able to get ahold of someone right away who was polite and helpful, and forwarded my request to the service tech, who got back to me quickly. Service tech showed up promptly and on the same day I called. Tech was very helpful in reviewing options and recommendations. Answered his phone later in the day for my follow up questions. We'll be doing an AC condenser install in a couple days, but so far so good.<//review>

They responded immediately. They let me know who was coming and when. It was a great experience and I will call them again. I didn’t know they did heating and A/C and just had my furnace checked and cleaned by another company. Next year.</review>< Gmap_id>

Our A/C unit died in the middle of the heat wave and John Stevenson Plumbing accommodated us on the day I called, sending their man Pedro out to help us. He had to order parts, but within 2 days out A/C unit was fully repaired and working, thanks to Pedro working late on a Friday to finish the work. We are so grateful, thanks for everything!</Text>

Excellent service and quality of work starting with the initial call, to the technician JD showing up at the house, very professional, polite and helpful to the follow up call after the was completed. The cost was clearly laid out and fair before any work started and the materials used were all best in class, not box store material. I hadn’t had a need to use a plumber in decades but when I do John Stevens will now be my go to.</text>

<Text>Alex and Mike cleared out all of our outdoor drainage system after 26 years of dirt, roots and rock build up. They were very knowledgeable, professional and extremely hard working. I didn’t think this was even possible after years contending with deep flooding around the house and one year seeping into the sunken living room. And no, insurance does not cover ground water damage to drywall and flooring. Very costly! We now have peace of mind for heavy rain. So grateful to this company.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This morning I received an email from John Stevenson Heating & Air; I called them and the young lady who answered the phone was very helpful got me an appointment an hour after I spoke to her...she was able to get her dispatch to squeeze me in.  The Technician got here at around 9:00am, he was clean very courteous.  He put on his booties and started working.  He spent about an hour and a half here, very thorough and he answered all my questions.  Excellent customer service!<//Review>

Needed help with the faucet in our office kitchen.  Technician showed up on time, was very polite, didn't try to immediately sell me a new faucet like the first plumber did.  He did a little trouble shooting (something the other plumber didn't do) and then gave me the contact info for the manufacturer of the faucet so that I could request a replacement head.

When my water heater decided to spring a leak that same week, I call John Stevenson Plumbing for help.  Technician was at my house in about 1 hour, installed a new water heater and brought my 30 year old installation up to code.</Text>

<text>Customer Service, Customer Service, all I can say is Customer Service from the first phone call through out the entire project. Yes, I paid a lot and I got a lot.
There is no price for “peace of mind” and ‘confidence in a job done right!”
I give 5 stars times 2.
I will recommend/refer business without hesitation.
I was between a rock and a hard spot didn’t know where to turn. I shopped local!
Once the immediate need was met I asked about another issue, could it be handled? Yes immediately on the same call.
Concerned about which credit card I would need to use, I inquired about financial program. Once again, no problem and 3 very reasonable choices to choose from.
Within 5 minutes I was notified by email approval for full amount and the program that worked for my budget.
I could not be more pleased. I have service regular service on the water treatment and tankless water heater. Everything was done professionally and with ‘joy’. Scott and his supervisor Joe were a team. I’m totally impressed.
Don’t mess around - shop a price or cut corners.. make the call. John Stevenson Plumbing!
Thanks Kim for handling my call at first and coordination of project thereafter. You were my first impression and it was caring quality service.
A very satisfied customer in Leucadia- Beacon Beach.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I called John Stevenson Plumbing this morning, 12/30/18, because the shut off valve for toilet snapped off.  Water started spraying the wall and new flooring.
The VERY professional answering service heard my sense of urgency, said they'd reach out to on call / duty technician, Ryan, and he'd call within the hour.  Ryan called me within 5 minutes, said he was almost finished with a job near by and be here within 20 minutes.

Ryan arrived, diagnosed the problem and replaced the valve within 15 minutes.
I'm new to the area so, not knowing my neighbors yet, had to rely on Google search for help.  I had called a few other 24/7 plumbing companies who didn't even have anyone on call.
Ryan & John Stevenson Plumbing will receive ALL of my business going forward.  I've scheduled them to come out this week during non-urgent hours to repair multiple plumbing issues.
Thank you so much Ryan / John Stevenson Plumbing,

Summary: Great company, did a fantastic job. Only word of advice is to do your homework and get multiple quotes prior to employing any contractor. It can only help. At the end of the day, they are running a business and will act as such, but they do so with professionalism and are always willing to listen and help.< /review>

We called John Stevenson Plumbing because they are local and we always try to use our local businesses.  Your commercials with the black/white dog brought us to your company, so cute!

We were treated with such kindness from my first contact with your receptionist.  Set up an appointment for the next day with Travis.  He was professional but friendly and ordered the necessary parts and was back (right on time) to spend the next day installing.  He was courteous and mindful of not messing up our home.  He even made friends with our small pet so she would stop shaking.  ;)  Overall, was a pleasant experience and will definitely call your company when we need help with our air conditioning unit or any other plumbing needs.  You are lucky to have such caring employees.  THANK YOU!<//text>

Both Travis and Thomas were very polite and courteous.  Everything about their work was fully explained and my questions were answered. I particularly appreciated both men taking time at the beginning of the visits to greet my two small dogs and become acquainted so the dogs  wouldn't bark or worry about the two men working around the garage and outside.</text>

<text>Incredible service. I called and scheduled a same day appt. For a kitchen leak. When I arrived home to meet them my water heater had just burst. They pulled up and jumped into action! Saved me from a terrible mess, replaced the water heater and then fixed my kitchen issue. It was Friday night and they stayed until all was complete and working. Left everything spotless. This is my 2nd experience with John Stevenson Plumbing. They are the best!< /text>< pics>

<Review>Jordan Dean, a plumber with John Stevenson Plumbing, came out to help us with a plumbing problem. He was quickly able to resolve the issue and took extra time with his equipment to show me where the problem was and how to keep it from reoccurring.  Pleasant, thorough, experienced, and effective were my impressions of their work.</Review>< Pics>

I am sure everyone can relate that it’s Hard to find a professional that isn’t booked solid for weeks out or resets appointments or late when they finally get there. I called John Stevenson Plumbing based on some reviews I read on line and they had a professional there the next day. Early for the appointment I might add. Work complete to my satisfaction and on my way to finishing my project. Thank you Travis Durkee at John Stevenson Plumbing I know what call to make for future plumbing needs.</text>

<Review>I have to say that I have used this company before, but feel very disappointed to recently learn that the information that I received from their service representative was incorrect.  I was told that my furnace was compromised and that I would need a brand new furnace for approximately $3500.  At the time of the service inspection, the service man showed me what he believed was rust or deterioration, so he unplugged my furnace and told me that I was in danger of having CO2 come into my house because of what he had found. He had shown me a red marking area inside one of the cylinders with a small flashlight explaining that the cavity had deteriorated.  After explaining to my husband later on the phone about this diagnosis, he found this hard to believe since we have had this company come before for yearly service to maintain our furnace and to prevent such thing from happening. My husband was perplexed since he felt  “why bother with the yearly service checks if the deterioration  was never mentioned previously or caught earlier?” So, we phoned another company who came  to perform their own inspection.  What they found was not rust nor deterioration, but conduit tape that was visible on the edge of the interior of the furnace.  They used a probe camera and looked inside and showed me personally what was there...  I could definitely see that this was not rust nor any peeling of the surface of the furnace nor deterioration as I had been led to believe. The new company checked for CO2 readings and found none! How does one mistake such a thing for rust or deterioration, and unplug the furnace, and say a new furnace is needed because the old furnace is compromised?  In my opinion, this was a bait tactic to scare us into buying a new furnace through them...or simply an unknowledgeable serviceman!  In any event, be aware!</Review><resp>{'time': 1528400031430, 'text': 'Good Afternoon Lorena,\nWe are sorry to hear that you were disappointed with our service. We take pride in the service we provide and, are disheartened to hear that you were unsatisfied. At the time of service, our technician performed a thorough inspection of your furnace. After the inspection he discovered multiple problems with the unit. One in particular was a potential cracked/compromised heat exchanger. Our customers safety and well being is our top priority, and because of this our the technician felt the best option at that time would be to replace the unit completely due to the potential dangers of this issue. Because we were unable to further asses the unit by having another technician go out to the home to go over our findings, we are not able to comment on the other companies findings. If you are ever in need of help in the future please do not hesitate to reach out to us.'}</resp>< user>

The technicians were professional and the quality of workmanship seems very good. However, considering the scope of work involved , even being after 5:00 p.m., I thought the charge was beyond exorbitant.</review>

Don't bother scheduling with this company: they don't show up.  I missed a half day of work for an appointment that never happened.  They couldn't show up within a 4-hour window, then tried to put the onus back on me because I said showing up at 5:30 was too late for my family.  Terrible scheduling, terrible service.  Find another company.<//Text>

We had a recent experience with John Stevenson Plumbing and HVAC for HVAC repair during the hot summer months. I did not expect to locate a company online with such positive reviews regarding customer service so quickly. The team at John Stevenson dispatched (Juan) to our resident within one to two hours are professionally confirming our appointment. When the service technician showed up (Tom), he politely called to confirm his arrival. This was ideal since we have two little ones at home napping.

John’s customer service was exceptional. Open communication on the issue, presented resolutions on the spot and utilized their smart device (IPad) to efficiently choose the products needed to fix the issue. After install, they cleaned up right away and followed through with a phone call to check in on the experience.

I had additional questions and contact their operations manager, Destry. Understanding that during this season, customers can get impatient and needy to fix their problem, Destry a very high level of knowledge and customer service to answer my questions.

Overall, the experience was positive. As a home owner with not much knowledge on HVAC systems, I felt I could trust a company with 30+ years of experience. From understanding the immediate need to fix issues and implementation on problem solving, the team knew how to get it done. Top that off with excellent customer service, Destry’s team is the choice!<//text>

< Review>
I was fortunate to have found these guys during a plumbing disaster on Thanksgiving Day, 2016.  I called six different plumbers and these guys were the only one that called back. They fixed my problem quickly.  I was extremely grateful and called them again when my business had a disaster in 2017.  Travis came out and surveyed the problem and got right on a water heater replacement.  He was very professional, knowledgeable and efficient.  Problem, once again, SOLVED.  2018...my home is on the market, potential buyers are coming to see the place and there is NO hot water.  Travis comes to the rescue again.  Diagnoses the problem, obtains the materials needed to do the job and AGAIN saves the day with a replacement for my 14 year old water heater.  He did a GREAT job replacing the crazy plumbing setup that was there.  My neighbors had their done by Travis at the same time.  They were extremely pleased with his work and the outcome.  John Stevenson Plumbing and his guy Travis are the ONLY plumbers I'll ever call when I need a plumber.</Review>

<Review>I had an emergency situation last night during a Christmas party at my home. I called around asking for quotes and estimated wait times. Everywhere was either to expensive or the wait was up to two hours. Travis called me back within 5 minutes, gave me a resonable quote and was there within 30 minutes. He fixed the problem, cleaned up any mess that was made from snaking a line, explained exactly what the problem was and was on his way. Easy breezy just how I like it! I will definitely use this company again!<//Review><resp>{'time': 1545175097836, 'text': 'Good Afternoon Jackie,\n\nWe are so happy that we were able to help you in your time of need, and get your problem taken care of in a timely manner.

<Text>Pedro-tech didnt even know where to look for the price of 24" section of 24v thermomstat wire on their own service software. After calling two people he quoted my $230 to replace a 24" section of the wire.

I said no thanks and he happily walked out and left!!

A+ customer service right there.

Five stars for John Stevenson's plumber Tech, Mr. Alexander Cose. Over the last 13 years we have never had any plumber visit our home that gave us confidence to request a 2nd call.
That changed on Friday morning 15 March.
Mr. Alex Cose arrived on time, inspired our confidence in his professional inspection report of our bathroom plumbing system needs and repairs. He gave us our options and we are glad we had Mr.Alex to perform the repairs. Fast response to our call for help.
Parts arrived on time, installation was on time. We are so very satisfied and happy with his work. Alex will be called back by us again later this year when we plan to repair our other bathroom.Thanks  to all the support people at John Stevnson's that we talked to in regards to appointment and follow-up .
Thank God, we have a great go-to plumber, like your best barbershop or your best auto repair shop or best tax guy.
Thank you very much Mr.Alex for your great work on our bathroom plumbing.<//Review>

Had a great experience with John Stevenson after having a horrible experience with Roto-Rooter.  I feel John Stevenson plumbing is fair and very skilled.  I feel completely differently about Roto-Rooter, who I will never call again.

My lesson - Go with someone you trust the first time.  Having to go back and get the work done again is costly.  Wish I would have called John Stevenson the first time out.</text>

This plumber was more than 3x our original plumbing bid.  we went with the other plumber.  The first bid $1,039 with a possible extra $100.   John Stevenson company was $3,189- How does that happen.  we have a very small condo and were replacing 1 bathtub with a small apt size bathtub and the installation of the new drains and valves.  After the tile goes in we just need them to set a toilet and the sink.  It definitely was not over $3,000 work.  Both bids included the bathtub - which was only a little over $300.< /Review>

Travis was good but made us believe that we had to have a permit pulled for a gas leak, even though SDGE said one was not required.  He capped off our gas line to our BBQ and fire pit and said that was where the leak was.  Told us that we wouldn't be using that anymore.  Tried to sell us a new furnace and water heater (totaling 17,000.00).  We declined.  SDGE came out, turned the gas on (without a permit) and reconnected the gas to the BBQ and fire pit...no leak!  Not sure what Travis was trying to achieve.</Review>

<review>Mike from John Stevenson Plumbing came to fix two "what we thought were small" jobs, but each was more complicated than anyone could have predicted. He did a great job and both the dishwasher and the guest room sink are now working perfectly.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I highly recommend going elsewhere.  What an absolute debacle.  All I needed was a valve and line attached to the toilet and they couldn't even get that right.  I was at work and called to have a simple service done so that my elderly live-in mother-in-law could have access to the downstairs toilet (getting up and down the stairs is difficult for her, especially if she has "to go").  I thought they could get it working within the hour and I could continue my work that day.  The part was about $35 retail.  He suggested a rebuild of the toilet system (didn't really need it, but I figured it would be ok).  He quoted an initial price of $670.  Wait, what?!  That's what a brand  new toilet and installation goes for. He then said, "Ok, I'll do it for $500" and said he'd totally re-do the guts.  All of a sudden you can skim $200 off?  What are they trying to pull?  He said it would be like a brand new toilet.  I messed up and said ok.  My fault.  The total cost of parts at Home Depot would have been about $60.  He spent 45 at my house.  When I got home, it wouldn't flush properly, he did not replace or properly sit the handle, and when I woke the next morning, the work he had done was clearly faulty and I had to call for another tech to come out to fix it.  Do not waste your time or money with these crooks.  Find another company that is honest and actually has integrity.< /review>

We pride ourselves in always taking care of our customers no matter the circumstances. We sent out our plumbing supervisor first thing in morning to address the issue that occurred yesterday. During the evaluation he noticed the full valve adjustment switch  was left down, and was not set causing the universal full valve to extend to its highest point allowing water to run. We corrected the issue immediately by making a minor adjustment to the part that should have been adjusted initially when it was installed by the previous technician who had forgotten. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with, or if you have any other questions or concerns please don't hesitate to reach out to us."}<//response>

< Review>
Water Heater Problem.   I confirmed they would attempt a repair and not just want to replace.   I agreed to $89 to get an estimate for the repair.   I got the call that it would be $260 to get the estimate when the tech was on site.   Confused, I talked to the Manager.   They said "extenuating circumstances".    Bottom line they won't repair a water heater that is not up to code.   None really are at this time.    The manager admitted such and refunded my $89 because "it was not a business match for him".   Because I am not going to be a victim?   They tried to blame me saying it should have been replaced many years prior.   Advice: Always get multiple bids when it comes to water heaters.   Don't let them corner you with a tech there, they probably only have a replace option at an excessive price regardless of what they say up front</Review>

<review>Stevenson Plumbing demonstrated unusual efficiency and courtesy in addition to the clean, careful, excellent work of Travis, the conscientious and pleasant man who properly repaired the incorrect work of another major plumbing company, as well as connecting many new components.

Price Gouging & poor customer service:
1) charged $222 to just remove the trap without solving the sink drain problem !!!
2) No responses from the multiple requests to discuss the issue with the managers ...

The technician Ryan misled the customer to sign the form (to charge $222) by promising to use snake to solve drainage in the pipe, but later Ryan asked the written permission from condo owner for using the snake in the cast iron pipe saying the insurance from the company does not cover damage from his using snake in the cast iron pipe.  When we asked why this condition was not revealed to us in the beginning, the technician Ryan told me it was the company's dispatcher responsibility to ask whether I rent or own the condo regarding the permission to use the snake in the cast iron pipe.

I was very unsatisfied for the incomplete job done by the technician Ryan and the fact that I was misled to sign to form to be charged $222. I think the partial work completed by Ryan was at most worthy the diagnosis fee $89, since I sign the form on the condition that Ryan agreed to use snake to solve drain problem, but he did not complete the job and later on Ryan even denied his oral promise.

I called the company multiple times and was not able to reach any manager via phone.  I left multiple messages to ask to discuss the issue with either Director of Operations Destry Thompson or his supervisor John Stevenson (owner), but had not gotten response after more than two weeks.

WHO would like to pay $222 for an unsolved kitchen drain problem? The same issue was solved within an hour by the professional plumber from another company.<//Text>

<Text>Unfortunately this time around my experience was not good. I had used them in the past and everything went smoothly, the job was done and the customer service was excellent. This time however a different story. We called regarding a stopped up drain, they responded very quickly and sent someone over within a few hours. Not sure why but the guy that was sent couldn't do the work, but he quoted us $800 and said that he would be back on Monday. He never gave us the written estimate but told my husband that we would receive it via email, we did not receive it Friday or on Saturday. We had no idea what we were going to be paying for. I called on Saturday to request a copy of the work statement and the answering service said that I could leave a message and my called would be returned. No one called on Saturday. I called again on Sunday, and received the same message from the service. So I emailed them, I received an immediate response from Destry Thompson stating that no one returned my call yesterday because they were not in the office. But hey he had time to send an email response to my email? Still no resolution so I requested that he cancel my appt that was scheduled for 8am on Monday morning. He made no attempt to call me to resolve my issue but instead had someone from his office send me the invoice for $89 for the guy coming on Friday to look at the job. THIS ALL ON A SUNDAY BUT HE COULDN'T CALL ME BACK BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT IN THE OFFICE. However, he did have time to email and/or call Kristin Fox  from his office as I received an invoice from her on SUNDAY for $89.00 which was for a "plumbing diagnosis". Unfortunately now we are looking for another plumber, good thing there are quite a few to chose from. :)<//Text>< Pictures>

Horrible service. I needed a home reverse osmosis system installed. Selected this plumber as they profess to be water filtration system experts. When I called to set up the service appointment I explained I had purchased all my own equipment, just needed it installed. I requested a ballpark cost for an install, and all they could tell me that with an $89 service fee they could provide an estimate, and that fee could go towards the cost for service that they would be able to perform on the spot. I took a half day off of work to wait out my 2pm-4pm appointment window, with tech arriving at 3:40pm to give me a 10 minute sales pitch on the home house filters they sell and install. He proceeded to show me quotes on his tablet, and whoa nelly, to install my RO system was going to cost $845 AND since it was almost 4pm, his quitting time, I would need to book another appointment. OMG. This company is a joke. Tech was bragging about how much more money they make for residential projects compared to commercial jobs. As a commercial construction project manager, I know they are milking innocent homeowners by over charging them. My commercial plumbers are upfront about costs and do not try to push sales of unwanted products. I appreciate that the local dispatcher Juan called to apologize, but said “company policy” this is how they operate. I instead watched a YouTube video and installed the RO myself. Highly recommended not using this company! Cheers!</Review>

Just had a really bad experience with these guys.  They replaced furnace igniters.  Priced them at $460 each (I had four replaced).  Found the units on the Internet after they did the work for $28 each.  I understand labor and overhead, but something's wrong with this picture.  Check around before accepting price on ANYTHING from these guys.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Spoke with the Director of Operations Destry Thompson.  This is clearly an UNFRIENDLY to the consumer company. Avoid at all costs if you value customer service or good value.  First of all he wanted to charge me for an "evaluation".  I don't need an evaluation we already know the heater doesn't operate.  Then he went into quizzing me, but not about the problem or our concern, or how quickly they could come out, he we was quizzing me about property ownership and status.

We are in escrow on this home and need to replace the Heater prior to close.  Apparently it's a company policy to not provide estimates or work on a home in escrow.  I even told him, if he was concerned about wasting time, i'd be happy to provide photos and he could bid off of that if he wished, but we need the work done prior to the close.  He showed zero concern about the problem, and wasn't concerned about our needs.  He was focused on their company's policy.  Well Guess what Destry, my policy is not to hire Poorly managed companies.  You are the reason why consumers dislike contractors.

Oh by the way I asked for his supervisor and he told me He is the man.

Avoid them, there are way better HVAC contractors out there that want to earn your business.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Response>{'time': 1564413437457, 'text': 'Good Morning David Caron,\n\nWe are saddened to hear that we were unable to provide you with service in your time of need. During summer months we experience a higher influx of A/C repair calls which can make it very difficult to make it out to every customer at the time they request. Our dispatcher tried to work with you to get you rescheduled first thing in the morning the next day, you advised our dispatcher that you were only available for an appointment after 5pm which falls into our after hour appointments and are never guaranteed that we can make it out during that time. Because we were unable to guarantee you an appointment after 5pm, we believe it was in your best interest that you tried reaching out to another company that would be able to make it out to you in the time that worked best for you. We pride ourselves on always providing our customers with a five star service experience and we are sorry that you feel this is not what you received. Thank you for your feedback, If we can assist you in anyway moving forward please let us know.'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>During our last cold spell I noticed our furnace pilot light was larger than it should be. Concerned we called John Stevenson who came out and charged us $89 to provide a quote of $610 to replace the gas valve. They also provided an alternative quote to upgrade to a new furnace. No qualifying specifications were provided on the replacement furnace - we were told we could look it up ourselves if we wanted more information which we did. No work was done on the existing furnace, our $89 was waisted on getting an estimate. We scheduled the replacement furnace installation only to find out the manufacture could not supply the product. John Stevenson offered an alternative unit which the scheduled installer admitted he knew nothing about when more information was requested.

We called several other companies who provided no cost estimates of $350 for the gas valve replacement and reasonable quotes for the furnace which we did replace. My advice - If you wish to receive honest and qualified estimates at no charge which is the norm in the Hvac industry, DON'T call John Stevenson!</Review>< pics>
