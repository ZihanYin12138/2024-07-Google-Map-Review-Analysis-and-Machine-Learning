This store is amazing. The best way I can describe it is to say it’s a “diamond in the rough.” I’m sure we all have preconceived ideas about pawn shops but Empire Jewelry and Loan is far from your practical pawn shop. As soon as you walk in you feel like you're in a high end jewelry store with such a great variety of items to choose from. Gio was very trustworthy and was able to beat all prices from other competitors when it came to selling a ring. Gio was very honest, and very easy to work with. When I went in to purchase an engagement ring, I was completely lost and was not sure what I was looking. He explained to me all of the differences and what to look for in diamonds. After I did my research without a question I had to go back! They have had my business for a long time, and will have it for many more to come.<//Text>

<Review>I've been coming here with my family for about 10 years and have never thought about going anywhere else. Many years of wonderful customer service thanks to Gio. He's been very helpful every single visit I make whether I'm looking to buy or sell anything.  I've never left unhappy from there. He always figured out a solution if I ever had a issue and he is very informative.  He was able to answer any question I've ever had. Overall great customer service and experience. I highly recommend coming here and asking for Gio.</Review>< Response>

I came to this location looking for a gift for a friend. I don’t know much about jewelry but Gio took the time to answer all of my questions and show me my different options. Great customer service, I will definitely be back and refer to others! Thank you Gio.</Text>

The most professional, respectful, courteous, and absolutely spotless pawn shop I have ever walked into. Alejandro and staff keep this place well organized, and did I mention clean and corona free ( not the beer). They all deserve a pay raise for their excellent service to the customers. I recommend this place to anyone who's in a tight spot. Thanks to all the employees, excellent work ethics.</review>

<rate>5</rate><text>I went to sell some of my coins and a ring. I’m not that versed on gold rings or diamonds and was nervous about going anywhere, with the fear of being swindled. Thankfully that was not the case because the guy that helped me was very honest and super informative! He was willing to buy my coins but advised me on how I can get more money off them by doing something else. He then assessed my ring and gave me a careful evaluation of the band and diamond attached to it. All in all, it was a great experience! I went in feeling un-easy but I left satisfied and my mind mind at ease!</text>< Gmap_id>

<Response>None< /Response><Rating>1</Rating><user_name>Andrew Grant< /user_name><text>I’m hard pressed to give any location a one star review but Lighthouse managed to hit that threshold.  Despite being branded as specializing in coffee, they have seemingly no variety in beans, roast, or tasting notes to choose from.  The drink prices, other than a basic coffee or tea, are roughly 20% more than you would pay at a Starbucks, and their food prices are astronomically high.  I made it just inside my front door before their travel cup gave out leaving me with a lovely mess and very little coffee to try; it wasn’t special.  The second piece of my order was intended to be a chai latte, however it ended up being, as far as I can tell, a hot chocolate.  Pretty much a total strikeout.

Sorry guys, but I’d pass.</text>< userid>

The bagels and cream cheese are good but the coffee is watered down So I don’t get my coffee there but I would recommend that the management goes around to different coffee houses in checks to see with the competition is doing. I would ask management to put more coffee in their mixes when they do their regular coffee blends. If others share my perspective please provide input so that we can get this coffeehouse to provide the best coffee for the neighborhood</text>

< review>
Formerly known as, The Good Cup, this cafe got a full on flip my house renovation and it looks good! New owners, new interior, new everything as of 2018. They even carry the town's best local espresso here, Handlebar Coffee, and pastries from the same bakery Handlebar uses. It's now a very beachy, communal style environment with strong wifi, a few scattered outlet options, booths, tables and out door patio seating. The bathrooms are a breath of fresh air too, which, if you knew Good Cup before, is really the cherry on top of this cafe renovation.

While in town I visited a handful of times trying their cucumber toast, oat milk latte, and acái bowls. All a few cents more than I would like to spend but well worth the purchases, would 100% recommend, and will be back for more! Handlebar Coffee, in and of itself, is a gem and the fact that there's a venue on the Mesa that carries it now just raised property values significantly, in my opinion! It's a must try, and oat milk is the best cream to combo it with.

The staff here are all so sweet and hardworking! They make a point to remember so many customer's names and keep things personable in a professional manner. They are super knowledgable on the brand and get things done in a prompt manner. I have nothing but great things to say about the food, drinks, and staff here. Oh and they're pet friendly (outside) so there's usually really awesome dogs hanging out nearby.

The parking lot seems to always have some construction going on and is definitely not ideal to find a spot quickly around lunch or dinner time. Lazy Acres, the amazing grocery store, is right across the lot + CVS and a hair salon are right next door the the cafe. Lighthouse brings a well fitting, super chill vibe to the Mesa in a modern fashion that fits the community perfectly and is well worth a visit.< /review>

<Text>Terrible drinks, didn't finish 3.5 oz  of it. 2 oat milk Gibraltars. Steamed way too hot, extraction was watered down and overextracted, maybe something like 1 to 3 or more. They were quite busy so they may not care but just trying to provide some constructive feedback.< /Text><time>1620321102874< /time></record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Seriously wonderful- I was lucky enough to stop by a couple times when visiting family in the area recently. The atmosphere is perfect- great for conversation or some productive work- the coffee delicious, and the food incredible. I had an almond croissant one morning, and I've honestly been day dreaming about their avocado toast ever since I had it the second day.  Definitely will stop back next time I visit, wish we had a place even half as good in my town.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>New favorite coffee shop! The atmosphere is great for studying or catching up with some friends. There are plenty of tables inside and a few outside, but the place can get pretty packed. If you need an outlet to charge, I'd recommend grabbing a table along the wall. There's a very clean bathroom inside, which is a huge perk if you plan to stay here for a few hours!

I've tried their Iced Chai with Almond Milk, Iced Latte with Almond Milk, and Cucumber Toast. All were delicious and I love that they have a variety of non-dairy milk options (soy, almond, oat). They also have a case of pastries featuring some local artisanal donuts from Hook and Press!

One thing to keep in mind if you're trying to reduce your single-use plastic: bring your own cup for all iced drinks! Unfortunately, they only have plastic cups which they use for "for here" orders. The smallest size for the iced drinks is 16oz, so make sure to bring a large enough cup. I brought my own cup the second time I came and saved $0.25!!! Save money and save the earth while sipping on some delicious drinks :)<//review><gmapID>0x80e915ebab9fde85:0xd70fef4908344cc7</gmapID>< Pictures>

Conveniently located next to cvs and lazy acres. Lots of students and professionals camp out here and do productive things. Wish they had more outlets though. Wonderful energy all around!<//review>< date>

Great lattes and a wide selection of pastries from Renaud's and Hook & Press. They also have other food items on their menu. Friendly staff. The space has a great feel to it - very open, light, and airy. Outdoor seating also available.< /text>

Good coffee, pastry, and other snacks. Fast service and friendly staff. Great place to sit outside. I miss the funky atmosphere of the old place a little. But definitely go here!< /review>

Tim and the rest at lighthouse are great!! The best coffee shop in town and the people that work there make it work.  The coffe is good but  You cannot find a more genuinely friendly staff.  They are the reason I come back time and time again.  Recommend!!!!</review>

<Text>A community park, clean facilities, and safe atmosphere. Drinking fountains, BBQ's and tables for parties. Restrooms are fairly clean and there is a small jungle gym for the children. Park is close to Downtown Fullerton and Shopping.</Text>< GmapID>

Couple of nice playgrounds although been here a couple times and homeless and drugs both times in surrounding common area.  That said, nobody bothers anyone in the play area though. They keep to themselves.</review>

It’s not a very clean place to bring your kids at all. Missing parts on the slides! I called city hall about it and they said that they were going to send people to o clean but never did at all! Yeah a lot of homeless and people doing drugs! Playground not safe for kids!! Tables are not even clean at all!<//Review>

I live down the street from this park. And it is by far the worst Park I've ever been to. The whole playground is broken and unsafe and I believe the city should do something about it.<//review>

I have been taking my pets here for more than 30 years.  The ownership changes, but service has kept me returning.  I now have a mini dachshund.  His nails are large and fast growing.   I take him once about every 2 weeks to keep them a reasonable length.  The cost is very reasonable ＄10.00 with no appointment required！< /Text>

I love this place! Best service and knowledgeable staff. Andrew, the owner, is adamant about only carrying the safest and most healthy products for your best friend. The groomers here are amazing. I bring my two huskies in for baths, and they always come out so soft and silky. Over the years we've regularly brought a number of our dog walking/ pet sitting dog clients here for actual haircuts and their owners are always pleased.< /review>

Expensive!  Just for doing the glands on 3 dog's was $10 each, which wasn't too bad but, $15 to wash your own dogs and my total coming to $60!  I couldn't wash my 3rd little dog because the price was already too high.  Cashier was nice.  My 2 dogs that had their glands done were quick & easy but, my 3rd dog cried like I never heard before.  They do have their own shampoos/towel that you can use but, I had all my stuff as the website instructed me to bring.<//text>

She hadn’t had her nails done since before all this in February so she was way overdue. She also is very old with a lot of health issues. She was treated with so much gentleness and care!! I even got to hold her during the trimming. Seriously the best nail trim she’s ever had. I will be coming back here even after the virus and in a couple weeks for her next trim.

Also, my dog can’t have anesthesia, so they recommended a great anesthesia-free option for her teeth cleaning! Will definitely be looking into this option</Review><Time>1589144875925</Time>< user_name>

<review>Love this place, amazing employees and great shop. Only problem is that the dog wash closes at 4pm so it is really hard to get there after work. It is also punishingly hot in there, no AC, concrete building, no air flow. I feel bad for the humans and the dogs. But overall, great local business with great prices.< /review>< Pictures>

Very disappointment, I went there to support small business but I guess this business don't need it ,and it was two people behind me !!!!

I have been looking for a place to take my new Dog. She was looking a little rough but thanks to Frank she looks like a totally different dog now I love her new look. Thank you to all of the staff for taking great care of Mimi and fitting her in to your already busy holiday schedule. We will be back and bringing our other dog<//Text>

It's great to have a place where you can wash your dogs with full access to everything you could possibly need. And it's even better that when our doggos need a real grooming, they are some of the best groomers I've ever used. Even when our dogs both got fleas, the staff at Dogromat were so lovely and helpful in getting our girls all cleaned up. They truly care about every dog that walks through their doors, and we are so happy to have them nearby.< /Text>< UserId.>

We love the Dogromat. We have been happy with the grooming every time we have brought our golden doodle in.
They are respectful, considerate and do a great job. And prices are fair. We definitely recommend.<//Review>

The owner is a real sweetheart.

I take Matilda and Coco here to get groomed ... if you prefer they have wash tubs available if you want to do this yourself.  They provide all the necessities so you can groom them yourself or you can bring your own (which I do).</Text>

The absolute best!  I took my beautiful Great Dane Emily who has just recovered from having a leg amputated to Dogromat yesterday for the first time.  Ileana and Cynthia could not possibly have been kinder, more helpful, or more friendly.  Ileana gave Emily easily the best bath she's ever had and lavished her with love and attention.  It truly touched me to see that after all this girl has been through what a wonderful "spa day" she was having and how happy she was.  I have taken Emily to many groomers in the past and Dogromat surpasses them all.  My only complaint is I wish there were more stars I could give them!<//Review>

<review>I don't know who these negative reviews are referring to?
I found them to be very accommodating, people of their word and the prices were great. Will continue to give them business.</review>< pics>

We initially called for an estimate to change the brakes on our travel trailer because they weren't engaging. They refused to provide one unless we brought our trailer. That should have been a dead giveaway that these people were not to be trusted. The second dead giveaway was that there were no vehicles being worked when we drove in Friday morning. They told us all brakes needed to be replaced and it was going to be over $1000. We took a mechanic friend to inspect the brakes and he told us there was at least two years left in them. We were charged $220 for nothing but wasting our time and effort (hitching and unhitching a trailer is not trivial). They didn't even bother to adjust the brakes. I don't know how long these people have been in business but given their complete lack of trustworthiness and competence, I don't think they will last.<//review>

Very delighted with the service. My old car, honda civic 2001, had an engine noise for awhile until i brought it to J&O to check , in Richmond. In less then an hour the problem was fixed. I am glad i used this company's service.</text>

This place is always solid. It's never too busy and the food comes out quickly. A great place for a lunch break.

I like the neon pink and green lighting inside.  It's very reminiscent of an NYC establishment at 3am. The loudness and chaos of the city behind you when you walk through the doors. All you can hear is the low frequency buzz and hum of the neon lights in the middle eastern restaurant. A respite of reliable quiet reminding you of your own steady frequencies that continue to hum through chaos. It's like standing at the edge of the ocean and watching the waves come in. No matter what, they will go out and come back in, and these neon lights will continue to hum...
Also - great food.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0qkLj3-fnVTe-jF8A-GpnGc2eSvtdZKvYP8uh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAPE9jnkBooge_uvwGbS70XzCAfFekyL06QjaS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfA3p9S2jpYB4-deE4-saljpab-PJp5dDH-fFR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

Good fresh food. I am a bit bias since I live down the street and walk to this place. I usually call ahead then pick it up. The cashier lady is always friendly and helpful.</Text>

<Review>Worst place ever.. don’t come here.

Too much price, less food, unclean, one person doing everything, dirty, there were staff on my chicken I had to return the food (their excuse was it’s wood.

This soup is ridicules and awful to drink.

Overall DON’T NOT COME HERE.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2b94cf35895e9:0x8ed6fc029ff975f5</GmapID>< Time>

<review>Good food...low key spot considering it’s across from the Beverly Ctr. I believe it’s the owner who took my order, nice guy and so are the cooks. I love that the food is prepared to order and in front of you. My second day in a row I’ve made my way here for lunch!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Terrible service and food presentation sucks, served on foam plates and plastic silver. Not the best thing for the price. Owner also seems to have different customer service for different races I kinda noticed that, anyways food I’ve had better two thumbs down</Text>

<review>I've tried all the chicken in town, believe me, more than once. The rotisserie chicken here is the best. The chicken itself is high quality, and I think the owner marinades it before cooking. The plate with Middle East salad and hummus is therefore delicious; but it is the high quality of the chicken itself that stands out. Where does he get it? How does he do it? I'm sure the owner or his daughter won't disclose!</review><date>1502676558412< /date>< user>

<Text>This is the second time ordering from Grub Hub with this Restaurant. in the same week.I really wanted to give it a second chance, there will not be a 3rd time.The Vegetarian Plate is $15.00. overpriced and small portions. Every item is very bland, no spices, no seasonings, the lentil soup is watered down again very Bland. Falafel's are hard as a rock not edible- Bland.as well. I clearly gave special directions to include 3 extra Pit's and they ignored it as it was extra charge's. Not bothering to call me so therefore sigh, only 1 Pita. Grub Hub was a complete waste of time, not helpful at all. Many more competent Restaurants and delivery services who actually value you as a customer.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Rude service, mediocre food at best, and overpriced to top it off. Didn't give me the soup that comes with my meal and tried to haggle with me when I asked for a garlic sauce and pita.  Reassured me that everything is the bag and that I didn't need sauce, then I said please can you just give me one more sauce and he tried to charge me another 75 cents...  I get home and there is no sauce and a tiny piece of pita.< /text>

<text>I really love Beverly Falafel. If you're craving some great lentil soup, rice and gyro then this is the place to be.  We used to work down the street and would come here quite often. At first, I felt like the owner was a bit like the soup Nazi on Seinfeld but then I felt he warmed up to us a lot once we started coming more often.

This place is in a tiny strip mall across from the beverly center and I'll admit that the parking SUCKS.  But, for great food at a good price it's the place to go.<//text><Name>Dawn Martin< /Name><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

Prices for special plates are not special at all. We got two plates, the rotisserie chicken and the lamb Kafta.The food was burnt. The rice has pieces of charcoal from the burnt chicken and lamb, the salad seems like it was made the day before. The chicken is like it was cooked yesterday and they warmed it up and it ends hard and burnt in your plate. the lamb gave me a heart burn and nasty burps. I will never step at this place again. until now I am trying to forget the money spent at this place because I am pretending I dropped the $30 somewhere I do not know. I have eaten a way much better than this.</Review>

The food was undescribable. The hummus was runny, the shawrma was like lamb curry with zero taste, the lamb chops were hard..we asked the owner to replace the lamb chops , he just re grilled them and charree them to pieces. It became unedible. The flafel was as hard as stone. The rice were equally bad..its just bad food and unless you are dying of hunger, I wont recommend this spot.< /Text>

< Review>
$20 lunch and super chewy Lamb Kabab in a down town style decorated Mediterainian fast food place is not an ideal lunch in West Hollywood.
- Rice was not good enough to make up for the chwey kabab.
- Super cold cucumber & tomato salad has plenty room for improvement
- Humus and the Pita bread is the only two item that is worth stopping by if you are just happy with that for lunch.</Review>

Pre-grilled meats, rice was kinda old and the only salad they have is made of 80% cucumber ...

< Review>
Very easy to work with. They weren't 'sharks' and very much understood our situation. They worked well in supplying solutions that best fit our needs and Jan and Zack went above and beyond in helping us with a new lease. We have been with them well beyond a decade and we are very happy with them. If you communicate with them and are clear with your objecuves, they will work with you. Highly recommended.
UPDATE: Monica and Andy have continued the stellar service as the newest crew in charge at iStorage. They truly make me feel welcomed and I fully trust this facility. I highly recommend this establishment and Monica and Andy are just phenominal!!!!<//Review>

<Text>Jan and nicole were great during our time of renting the unit great customer service always kept busy and has the best positive vibes no matter what! Oh wait i almost forgot to mention me and my fiancee decided to make a last trip one last trip to just move in to our new place. So we get home and im searching and searching for my phone 100% sure i knew i must of left it in the car so this was after we had told jan we wont be needing the unit thank you so proud we were that my fiancee gets a call from storage saying did we lose a phone so thanks to jans great memory on faces she remembered our faces that were the same onthe phones screen so she held it for us and idk who found it on premises and reported it but thank you and god bless. By the way i believe they deserve a raise jan and nicole.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Basically went in to inquire on pricing ask questions. Customer service there was horrible.  Pricing doesn't include insurance, which I don't know why you would have to provide, the price should include it, but you don't need it if your rental or homeowner's insurance policy covers personal property. I wanted to see what the units looked like, at least 2 of them, but the lady there basically said, "Well I am not going to show you a bunch of different units if you don't know what you want!" So I was like ok ciuld I see at least 2 to get an idea, but I quickly changed my mind and told her I would have to check with my insurance carrier as to my coverages. There was no way I was going to give them my business with that horrible attitude! Ended up going to ExtraSpace Storage of of Blosser on Farnel Road. The guy there was more than happy to show me 2 units, gave me 50% off the first 3 months and was much frendlier and helpful. Sometimes,  no wait, all the time people will go to where they are treated with exceptional customer service, even if they have to pay a little more! Change your attitude lady!<//Text>

They lied about the 24/7 access to the rental unit. They overcharge and bill for rental inaurance even after you provide them with your own i rental insurance policy. They charge outrageous fees for late fees even when its their fault. Your access codes are gauranteed to never work when they are closed. Not concerned about your ability to access your unit. Only interested in ripping you off<//Text>

Rented from them for 2 years found out that they had scammed me on the "protection plan" the whole time. Then after I closed out my unit iStorage charged me for 2 extra months. They refunded me for 1 month, but are refusing to refund me for the 2nd month that they charged me. The whole staff were useless in get this fixed.<//Text>

{'time': 1471478069261, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your recent storage experience with us.  We apologize you were not completely satisfied.  As agreed upon at time of move-in, rent is not refunded for partial months, July.  August was refunded to you as you vacated in July.  Property Protection is a requirement of rental.  Your monthly payment included this amount and was agreed upon in writing at the time of rental.  If you would like to discuss this further our District Manager would be happy to speak with you again.  Thank you for your business.'}<//Response>

I showed up to Avant with my 2014 sprinter van. I was sent their from a shop around the corner who told me that drew was the DOCTOR of sprinters.  They were not wrong. My van was generating no power and the check engine light was on. This was 9 hours into a multi-way trip. Drew helped us out immediately. While doing so he explained to me in detail what  was happening and how to avoid further complications.

Not only was he informative but also fast. He got me out in less then an hour with all problems fixed even gave me a light bulb for one of my front lamps for free. Since then i have put on roughly 2500 miles and drove about 45 hours not a single problem.

BIG THANKS.<//Text>

<review>Refreshing to find an independent German Auto Repair/Tuning shop of this caliper nestled right here in Truckee.  I knew I was in the right place minutes after stepping in the door and talking with Jay.  I went in with questions about an oil cooler leak I noticed on what looked to be a well maintained early model MB ML500.  They squeezed me in the following day.  We scheduled an inspection and while in there owner, noticed more than a few other glaring issues.  He opted to do their thorough 30pt pre-purchase inspection, uncovering years of neglected maintenance and a leaking rear-main seal.  The cost to repair this seal and to re-seal the front of the motor just to cure the leaks exceed the retail value of the vehicle. The 30pt inspection was very detailed and included multiple pictures.  Drew spent another 25min with me reviewing each page and discussing the problems.  I felt he and Jay went far and above "usual and customary" I will certainly be returning and will be recommending Avant Werks to family & friends< /review><GmapID>0x809bdfc248267aab:0xf466e59d23ef706e< /GmapID><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

The work was scheduled and begun right away after my arrival. It took a while, as it is a complicated installation, but it was completed correctly and for the quoted amount. Avant Werks is a Stealth Hitch dealer and installation center. There was another installation going on as well ( a Mercedes SUV) and both were completed during the day. I highly recommend Avant Werks for anything Audi and, also, for Stealth Hitches.</Review><gmap_id>0x809bdfc248267aab:0xf466e59d23ef706e<//gmap_id>< time>

I appreciate the ongoing efforts of the Avant Werks team to provide quality service, especially when things don't go as planned.  Due to some miscommunication, my new tires and head lamp replacement weren't ready as expected.  After a short conversation, the team quickly pulled off getting a new head lamp in by the end of the day and tires 2 days later!  Thanks to all of you for the quick problem solving and extraordinary customer service!  See you for my next oil change!< /Review>

I have taken multiple cars to Avant Werks and have always been pleased with their service levels, knowledge and quality.  I recently took my 14 year old, finicky Land Rover to them for service and once again they did a terrific job.  Jay made sure to keep me updated, the owner even stepped in himself to help with diag and they didn't pressure me to do more work than I wanted on this older vehicle.  The car was given back to me in great working order, nicely cleaned and I'll be taking it back to them for continued service.  I'm used to people working on mountain time with less than top notch attention to service but Avant Werks is top notch and very much appreciated!< /Review>

I probably would have also clicked on punctuality also but I was in no hurry to get my car back over the winter since it is not a four-wheel-drive and I couldn’t drive it anyway.</Review>

Drew and his crew at Avant Werks were awesome.  We were from out of town, far out of town, and only there for a long weekend.  I called him Friday morning to see if he could fit me in to diagnose my Eurovan.  He said yes...It took time with the tow truck and when we finally got there at 3:30 he still took a look at it, staying after hours.  Although it was not something we could correct quickly his willingness to help out a VW friend was commendable.  He also provided some great info for the future.  We wish we lived closer to his shop as I would likely go back.<//review>

Great Shop!  They know German vehicles.  Doing repairs quick and using high quality parts.  Either updated parts from oem or aftermarket to make sure the same problem doesn't return.  My cars have been getting updated to what they should have been like from the factory.  The only way I'd buy a German car is knowing I have Avant Werks down the road able to handle any repairs and explain issues in actual english...< /Text>

Recently had a performance tune on my car.  Even though they were very busy, they stayed well past their normal hours to keep working and finish the job the right way without cutting corners.

Definitely a shop with passion for cars and service focused on their customers.</Text>

After calling several places to try and get my intake valves cleaned, Avant Werks was the only shop to take the job. My vehicle didn't meet their normal requirements, but they extended me an offer anyway and I'm glad they did. ALL cars with GDI engines (think most modern turbo cars and 4cyl) will eventually NEED THIS DONE. And it's worth it! On top of the cleaning, they found a damaged wire harness during the safety inspection and got it tidied up and then some. They were communicative, easy to work with, and did a really great job.  When my car needs this service done again in a few years, this is where it's going. Thanks guys!< /review>

I was passing through Truckee in my BMW when I had a problem with my windshield wiper.  I dreaded the thought of an 80 mile detour to Reno to take it to a dealer.  Fortunately, I found Avant Werks, a professional shop with a very friendly and skilled staff.  In minutes my problem was fixed and I was on my way.  Thanks very much guys.< /Text>

Called about a PPI from a local car. Very quick to answer the phone and take time to answer my questions. I'd take my car here if I were local based on their phone responses.< /Review>

Know any food as soothing as ice cream? Pure satin-on-the-tounge Paradis, named appropriately = 5☆ delights!
Two young men (with young families) worked by day and "icecreamed" by night to build  this "dream-come-true" world we can step into and enjoy. Total "de-stresser"!
The quintessential "old-timy" ice cream parlor with a Millinial up-date.
Beautifully done interiors...so welcoming you won't want to leave...and no one does!
On the way out, we stopped on the back patio to admire two georgous dogs. Such nice owners came with them, (we stayed another hour just chatting). GREAT THEARPY!
They are generous with taste of their many "origional" flavors...and the final product texture is amazing!
Pretty lasses are quick to greet and please you...which makes for a pleasant experience. They are very fast!...(you can use the time to choose your flavors.)
Great after-taste from the pure ingredients. Great memories the next day...(like a good movie).
Congratulations! You "nailed it!" Really nice quality all-around!
On my top 10 Ice Cream Shop's! (With Pleasure!)< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Response>None</Response><Text>By far one of the most interesting ice cream places I've been to in term of flavor. I can honestly say that they have the most accurate flavors descriptions of any other vendor. They don't have the largest variety of flavors but they change their offerings pretty frequently. Also, they are vegan friendly and if you buy the love box you can bring back the box (after you wash it of course) and they will use that container to give you your ice cream and thus reduce the amount of trash they produce. Great service, you can play the games they have there while you enjoy a relaxing atmosphere, and you can even try every flavor before you buy it. For sure one of my favorite places to buy ice cream.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH2P8aTJiAet2tZ4x7hXzBzDR3amgrdr-40u8X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures></record>

Sooo good! Sunday= $1 off sundaes and they are big and sharable! The vegan options are great for sensitive tummies but all the flavors are delicious!</review>

Ton of awesome flavors... 16 in total, I think. This is a cool Danish ice cream brand and I've seen it in Montrose, but trying it for the first time here in Claremont.

Brand new shop, just had their grand opening. It's on a Main Street of a college town.  Def worth a visit!  I got 3 scoops and next time I'm getting the famous Lovebox sampler.< /text>

Waffle bowl was very fresh and tasty. Liked the flavor choices and decor. The gelato wasn't as creamy as I would like, a little light. The flavor was good< /review>

I was ecstatic to find this location after Paradis Pasadena became our favorite ice cream shop. I like this location more since it is bigger with more seating and convenient free parking! The staff is EXCEPTIONALLY polite and friendly, holy cow. The ice cream is always absolutely amazing of course. I appreciate that they have an array of flavors and include fruit flavors and vegan options. My favorite will always be the salted caramel and as of lately, just regular old chocolate, as it is not so regular here< /review>

Tasted sooo handcrafted and pure. Too bad I'm cutting out sugars. But my kids will be back.< /review>< user_id>

Wonderful place to get ice cream. Rotating cast of flavors. When we went, they had 4 vegan flavors. Oh yeah, they have vegan ice cream! All were pretty delicious. Open later than most places. Also serve complimentary brewed coffee! Very friendly staff. Great place to get ice cream in the Village. And the only place, as far as I know, to get vegan ice cream! Highly recommended!</Text>

Very easy to eat. Doesn't feel heavy. My favorite sundae combo is the coconut pineapple chip and banana sundae with caramel,chocolate and strawberry sauce on top. Tastes like a traditional sundae but really good.</Review>

Ate at one of the restaurants near by and came in for dessert. The shop several options of ice cream but my favorite was the lemon one. It was textured like a sorbet and it was the perfect thing to have on a hot evening< /text>

I wasn't crazy about the sorbet as it was airy and not much strawberry flavor.  Yeah, I can make it much better and should open up my own place instead I make my own at work.  Anyway, ice cream was icy.  Overpriced for what it was<//text>

Yet another dessert store has opened up in the Claremont Village! With my sweet tooth I just had to see if Paradis would be a new guilty pleasure for the next time I'm in the village, and I have to say that I was not disappointed :)

There's a wide range of flavors available, and my server informed me that Paradis rotates their flavors every day! Definitely an interesting way to keep customers coming back for more.

My gelato was creamy and rich without being too heavy. I also fell victim to ordering a chai latte because of their machine that allows you to print any image onto the foam of your drink. The chai latte was surprisingly flavorful and it was a nice dessert pairing for a cool night.  I may have to come back again to try some more of their flavors the next time I'm in the village!</Text>

It's my go-to ocean cream place that I recommend everyone to try at least once. The only downside is that it gets pretty pricey. Their ice cream is really good, and they switch up their flavors pretty often, although you'll still see some of their classics stay, like the stracciatella, chocolate, strawberry sorbet, coffee, etc.< /review>

Immediately walking in the servers gave me and my husband bad looks. I asked for only 2 samples of their ice creams and the tall brunette was very condescending when we asked her questions. When we finally ordered the server said we have to pay first before she can make our shake and smoothie, so we did. We stayed for a bit to play board games and during that time we saw that server make the orders of other costumers before having to pay. I only hope that it wasn’t the color of our skin ( my husband and I are both dark Mexicans) is not the reason why we were treated so badly. I’m never coming back here again<//review>

They are a very friendly, welcoming, and helpful dentist office . I like the way the doctor explains things to my kids who are age 14 and 16. I wish they were able to continue having Dr.Ben as there dentist even after they turn 18!!<//Review>

< review>
Consistent, Professional and most of all, genuinely cares for the welfare of my children’s teeth. The current state of our world is very troubled. Staying safe, healthy, patient and peaceful is quite difficult. Yet, at Powell Dentistry with the friendly front desk and Dr. Nelson’s expertise is the noble, quiet, bright light of hope that there’s still good dentists out there (the proficient equipment and personal kids tv entertainment is A+ per usual). Thank you Ingram staff, for giving my children a chance of getting their smiles back. We are very, very thankful for all of your support and determination in sustaining healthy teeth in our community.</review>

Friendly and nice, never have to wait more than 5-10 min. My girls love the balloons and books they get to pick out after their exam. Highly recommend<//text>

<Text>We have never had a bad experience here! From the moment you walk in the door the staff are amazing. My biggest goal was for my boys (4yrs and 2yrs) to not be afraid of going to the dentist. I loved my dentist as a child and wanted them to have the same positive experiences and they do here with Powell Dentistry.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Dr. Powell did an awesome job on fixing Andrew's broken tooth!   ANDREW WAS SO HAPPY!   Dr. Powell made a soon to be teenager grin from ear to ear! He couldn't stop looking at it and even wants him to fix his non broken tooth because he made it look so good!< /Review>

Brought my 3 year old here for a consultation, was screened upon arriving. The lobby is set up so that people can socially distance, the entertainment is closed off for the time being but looked like fun! The staff was friendly and patient from beginning to end. My daughter seemed comfortable and I got several thumbs up from her during the visit. I will be returning here for all future pediatric dental needs despite the long commute.< /review>

Powell Pediatric exceeded my expectations on my first visit when I had to bring my three year old girl in for shattering her front baby tooth!  I was very tense and more nervous than she.  The staff and dentist put me at ease with their kindness, compassion for my experience and their skillful diversion techniques.  The dentist shared a similar experience with his child and was great at communicating with my little one and making her feel comfortable.</Text>

Dr Nelson is wonderful, my son had had a traumatic tooth injury and Dr Nelson took the time to sit with my son and I and explain what was going on and what expect as he continues to grow.  He told me to contact him at any time of things change.  My children have had a positive experience every time we go to Powell Pediatric Dentistry.  I highly recommend the company and Dr Nelson and his staff!!</text>< pictures>

<review>I am beyond happy with this team! My 6 year old son had to have a tooth pulled. Scary right?! Even for us grown ups. I was so nervous for him and didn’t know if he would be able to go through with it in the office with out having to go to a surgical center to be put to sleep for the procedure. Dr. Nelson and his staff was AMAZING!! My son did fantastic! Dr Nelson and his dental assistant were so friendly and kept my son calm and relaxed and comfortable. My son not once freaked out or cried. I was so proud of my son and yet again SOOO impressed by Dr Nelson and his team. I can’t thank them enough for a job well done ❤️<//review>< pics>

I really appreciate Powell’s. My 6 y/o is not a fan of the dentist, but they are incredibly patient and kind. They tell the kids what is happening, let them touch things and see what they’re doing, and ask questions. There are some places that say they’re for kids, but the people really don’t know how to work with children. This is not one of them.

Pre-COVID they had an indoor two story playhouse, tablets, and books for the kids. Mine actually asked to go early this trip to play, and was very disappointed that the virus took away this fun part of his trip.</Text>

Amazing staff and service. Everything was explained to me in a way that I understood and felt confident about caring for my child’s dental needs. My kids loved the free balloon and free book also. The waiting area was kid friendly and welcoming; they have a club house and tablets in the waiting room to keep them entertained while waiting to be seen, which wasn’t very long of a wait. We will be back!</text>

Best pediatric dentist you’ll ever find. I’ve had the pleasure of Having for dentist work with my daughter. They are very caring toward kids anxiety and also very sincere-in the health of your  child’s dental health. I’m glad we found this gem.  Dr Nelson is a phenomenal doctor especially when it comes to cosmetic work for your kids.  Now add another happy baby to the list!!!! Great job guys!!!<//Review>

This was my son’s first time there and they were very patient and gentle with my anxious 4 year old. They want to build trust with kids who are nervous like my son was so they won’t push anything on them. They were able to get him to cooperate using kid friendly techniques that were playful. My son and I both left feeling great about his visit.</text>

<Review>My kids have been going for years. Staff is very nice. Now at the newer location with Dr. Nelson. Love that they have Disney Plus while cleaning teeth. Never had a cavity! They always go over proper brush/floss. I forget now that she’s so old, Dr. Powell’s office helped my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x809442a3e346f081:0x8a2105e94fe1f5e8<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had four children that needed to be seen by the dentist, ages ranging from 15 years old to 21 months and let me just tell you they were amazing and so patient with all my children especially my toddler. I thought I was gonna have to hold down a screaming toddler so she could be seen but that wasn’t the case at all, she did so well and let the dentist look in her mouth with no trouble at all and even let the dental assistant brush her teeth. I was so happy but kinda jealous because she gives me such a hard time at home lol. The whole staff was amazing, from the moment I walked in approaching the front desk all the way to the back with the rest of the staff. AMAZING I loved this dentist office so much and so did my children, best experience I ever had, especially for my children. They know exactly what they are doing when it comes to handling children, plus they give your child a dental baggy of dental goodies, balloons and they get to pick a book on their way out by the front desk. The waiting area is a very clean beautiful set up as well, trust me you won’t be disappointed I’m so glad I found them!< /review>< Pics>

At other offices I’ve felt rushed, left the office with lots of questions, and just had an overall sense of ‘what just happened?’. This was the complete opposite experience. Dr. Nelson, and all staff took time to explain things well, anticipated questions one might have, and answered what few questions I had left. They are very knowledgeable and kind. Highly recommend them!</text>

Wonderful place to take your children. My son is not a fan of doctors but LOVES going to the dentist. The environment is not your typical sterile office feel and it really helps the children feel at ease! The hygienist and dentist are kind and friendly which is a MUST when dealing with young children.< /review>

This dentist was recommended to me  by my mother in law, who’s coworkers highly recommended. I took my daughter to her first appointment yesterday. I was very satisfied with how friendly the staff was from the receptionist to the MA who made my daughters visit very comfortable, to the Dr. Nelson who explained everything step by step and answered all my questions. My daughter left that office wanting to go back again. Mind you my daughter is very scared of dentist. I highly recommend this Dentist if you want your kids getting the help they need for their teeth and feeling very comfortable with every visit they have.< /text>

Plus they have ipads, a play structure, disney+ for the kids to watch during their cleanings, and after each visit they get a balloon,  dental goodie bag, and a book. Simply amazing!</review>< pics>

<Text>I didn’t know how my 3-year old would do at his first dental visit, but the staff was great with kids and everything went amazingly smoothly. They played cartoons on a screen over the chair, and explained everything they were doing in kid-friendly terms. Afterwards he got a balloon, bubbles and a book. He did not want to leave! I was very impressed with the whole experience, and would definitely recommend this dentist to anyone.</Text>< pictures>

Great office. This was the first time my son could sit through a dental exam. Now he asks me when his next appointment is and is excited to go. They have great headphones that block the sound and they are gentle and patient.< /text>

Powell Pediatric is a wonderful place with a friendly staff, and Dr. Nelson is a kind, patient, and knowledgeable dentist. They offer an inviting waiting room with a play area and iPads with games, movies on the ceiling for kids while they get their teeth cleaned, and they give a balloon and book to each child after their appointment. This place has thought of everything to make kids (and parents) feel welcomed and comfortable. Thanks Powell Pediatrics!</text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Took my 1 and 2 yr old in for a visit and I fell in love with the office and staff. The waiting room has iPads available at a table to explore on and there’s also a large slide/club house area for the younger ones to play! My kids loved it! Once it was our turn the open space was a nice touch. The assistants helping us were very nice and did a very good job. My kids were scared at all and we were in and out in no time! I definitely recommend this place!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>We absolutely love them here. My son had a not so great experience at another pediatric dental place and since he has hated going. This office and staff is changing that for him. The office is clean. He loves the waiting area but the staff is so quick to call you back that there is not a long wait. This is huge for me being that I am taking him during  my work hours. They are also fully prepared for your little one, making it that more of a personal experience. The TVs on the ceiling make me wish I could make an appointment for myself. To top the whole experience there is a rack of.books your child can pick from at the end. No more cheap toys that break in the car ride home, but something that you can enjoy with your kids. Love them here and I will reccomend to anyone.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Dr. Nelson is outstanding!  My kids love him and never fight to go for a visit. We let everybody we know about Powell Pediatric.  Dr. Powell and Dr. Smith are equally exceptional.  You can't go wrong with this team!< /Text>

<Review>The staff was so sweet and gentle with my baby girl. She loved it and I was happy with the cleanliness and friendliness. My son also got a check up and he enjoyed it as well. They were so happy leaving the dentist. Everyone was happy and it was just an overall great experience.<//Review>< response>

The staff front and back were amazing. We had a snag with our insurance trying to confirm it and they were super helpful. Even after I left and came back a few min later they were able to put my son back on thier schedule. The girls in the back were super friendly and helpful and made my child feel at easy. Dr explained everything very well to me about my son's treatment plan and options. I will recommend them to anyone I know with kids to go thier.</text>

My kids love going to Dr. Larson. My ten year old appreciates being treated like he is the patient - not mom - and takes Dr. Larson's advice very seriously. My 15 year old thinks there is no better dentist after he expedited treatment of her chipped tooth. He understood her concern and took the opportunity to reinforce the importance of proper dental care. And my daughter who is 17 now, is dreading having to go to another dentist because she has complete confidence in his work.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>My daughter has been dreading the dentist for quite some time and very apprehensive.  I took her to her first dentist check up with Dr. Nelson.  It was wonderful - the waiting room had a little playset for kids which she loved.  It's usually a task for me to keep her busy during doctor visits, so thank God for the playset.  The hygienist was awesome and so calm with her.  There were headphones and a tv provided during the xrays and cleaning to keep her perfectly distracted and occupied.  At the end, she received stickers, toothbrush and toothpaste, floss, a balloon, and a book of her choice from their collection of children's books.  Afterwards she said, "I love going to the dentist mommy!"  Happy daughter. Happy mama.<//Text>< pics>

<review>My son was scared to go to the dentist, but the hygenist was really good at helping him relax and feel comfortable. Dr. Nelson was really good with kids too. My son really liked the treehouse in the lobby and ipads to play on. He asks me like everyday to go back so he can play with the ipads. There were also tvs in the ceiling so the kids can watch while getting their teeth cleaned. I remmend him to my friends.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

While I’m sure Dr. Larson is a qualified dentist, his chair-side manor is severely lacking.  He chastised me for telling my son the truth about his cavity.  He has been a little shorter with my kids than I thought was necessary.  I don’t baby my kids about this stuff  but he shouldn’t step off on them because they’re scared.< /Text>

A “go to” spot when I am in Ontario is the Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar.

The atmosphere is laid back with a proper hint of sophistication.  The indoor dining room has exposed stone and rafters that gives it an almost mountain lodge feel.  Huge TVs adorn the bar area with a choice of sports.  Outdoor patio is spacious and shaded in the summer.

The staff is friendly, professional, and prompt. I sat at the bar area and was highly impressed with the service from Jessica and Devin.  Great duo tag teaming to keep things moving along.

As for the food, the menu is large and it is always hard to pick something out.  Everything looks so delicious.  This visit I chose the Chicken Pot Pie.  They run out of this item often, and I was here early so I thought I better get it while I could.  It came out hot and flaky.  Despite the fact it was 85 degrees outside I really enjoyed this “winter” fare and my latest visit to the Lazy Dog.<//review>

<review>Since pandemic outdoor dining is the best way to support businesses. We went for lunch and not disappointed with their menus. 1/2 sandwich and salad was my choice. Walnut chicken salad sandwich and wedge salad were refreshing and delightful. It was a good proportion for the price. Chicken lettuce wrap was my favorite also. The ambience was great shaded with trees and umbrellas.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>My husband and I loved this place. I got fried chicken and it was delicious! I wasn't sure about it having maple syrup but it definitely added to it! Service was great. We had three different servers in the short time we were there but they still made sure we had everything we needed.< /review>< pictures>

I had such a wonderful dinner and drinks with some co workers recently and I must say my first experience with Lazy dog was wonderful. Love the “from scratch” kitchen, my food was so delicious and came out hot! The drink menu isn’t too extensive however they have a bar inside that can take requests from you. Wonderful experience that you can even share with your four legged friends! You can view you menu and pay on your phone for an easy experience.<//review>

Excellent!! I loved the atmosphere. Drinks were fast and on time as well as our food. I tried things I've never done before like that peanut butter burger wow. And service was outstanding we tipped them 20 bucks a piece it was well worth it</text>

The Lazy Dog passed my expectations!!! Everyone that recommended them to me gave high praise and I absolutely know why now!!! I ordered curbside, arrived a few minutes before the estimated ready time, called to let them know I was there, and a couple of minutes later I was greeted by a very nice gentleman and off I went with a bag of extremely great smelling food. After gtting back and opening the bag I saw an awesome job at making sure everything traveled in perfect condition. I got the Chicken Cordon Bleu and it was by far the most delicious meal I've had in quite awhile.</Review>

<review>We joined some of her work friends there last Friday night.

I had the bbq ranch burger.  Oh boy!  Big, juicy, fresh.

She had the bison burger.  Oh, my, Gawd!  This thing was massive.

We both had the sweet potato tots.  Very different experience  to regular tots but, really good.

The service was great and the price was fair.  We'll go back.<//review>< Rate>

We had a reservation. We were seated on time. Our hostess was great never had to ask for a refill once! She was on it. Really my only complaint was that it was in the 90s outside so we sat inside to be cooler.  It was so warm in there we were actually fanning ourselves.  It was pretty uncomfortable.<//review>

<Review>Got a simple club sandwich with Cajun fries and it was all delicious! Just wish they had turkey burgers. But I will be back to try more dishes and their drinks are made strong which is always a plus!</Review>< time>

I had tempered expectations initially (see cons below) but overall we had a solid meal. The hush puppies were tasty, chicken sandwhich was great, and those onion rings were so good! Only putting 5 on my plate was a bummer, but I left so full you probably did me a favor.

Con - When we got our cups and silverware both with visible food marks on them. I  just polished both with my napkin and chose to believe they were washed well enough. They were super busy so I'm sure things got turned over quickly.<//Review>

Surprised no hard ciders available, not even Angry Orchard. One hard seltzer choice. Wine was fine.
All good until our entrees arrived. DO NOT order the Pad Thai noodles unless you enjoy overcooked rubbery shrimp and your entire plate drowned in sauce (I asked for no chicken). I am not exaggerating. Tiny bits of tofu or possibly egg were barely visible. No sign of the bean sprouts (unless they were wilted into the glop) or peanuts. What an unappetizing mess. Taste was fair, the bit that I could eat. I brought the rest home but it'll go straight into the trash.
My friend had the overdressed Ahi Tuna Salad and the shiny, wilted greens were unappealing. Overall a disappointment.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Indoors and outdoors seating. Pups are welcomed as long as they are well behaved. Secret pup menu available. Food is always on point and I've never waited more then 45 min to be seated.  A little expensive but healthy options are good. Very nice outdoor ambiance.< /text>

<review>My husband and I were looking forward to having lunch together so we planned it ahead of time. We arrived just after 11am, so we got there before the lunch crowd. We were seated right away, had excellent service and the staff was friendly and responsive.  We really enjoyed the food and service. Definitely will go back again.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< Rate>

Arrived early so knew we would have a wait, but when the time came and went still nothing, called again and got the same woman, gave her the same info and still had to go inside. What the heck is the point of curbside pick up? Worst curbside I have used.</Text>

We had an excellent dinner here at the LAZY DOG Restaurant. I suggest making a reservation fyi!!! The weekends are busy!!!! The service was on point, our food was fantastic and we had an excellent waitress by the name of Crystal. She was fast, efficient and very attentive. You should order the cajun fries which are one of my favorite appetizers. They are way good!!!! Nonetheless, we will continue to wine and dine here at the Lazy Dog Restaurant<//Review>

Great food, beautiful patio area, friendly staff. My only reason for 4 star is it took my lunch forever to arrive. The people I was with were halfway thru there meal before I received mine, and I ordered 1/2 sandwich & salad nothing difficult. They did apologize & comp my lunch to rectify it. Definitely not somewhere you want to go on your lunch hour unless its OK to take a 2 hour lunch.</review>

First time to eat at lazy dog. OMG the food was so unexpectedly delicious it takes you to heaven and back. We order fish ad chips , hamburger with onion rings which was the best I ever had. The service was amazing and staff was very friendly and professional. Thank you for great experience</text>

< Review>
I ordered the Parmesan chicken and a side of sweet potato tots and I was not disappointed! The price is a little high but honestly you get what you pay for. The sauce was outstanding and the chicken was phenomenal! Every bite is pure crunchy perfection. This is honesty the best chicken Parmesan I’ve ever had. The tots are great as well. The detail the cooks and employees put in shows this is not your ordinary mediocre spot. They go above and beyond to deliver a fabulous dinner!Thank you lazy dog I will definitely order again when I am in town.</Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>DO NOT ORDER TAKEOUT.  Or if you do, go in and get it. Don't park and call like it says to do in the parking lot when you arrive to pick up. We did that. Told them what spot we were in. Waited ten minutes before going inside, our food was just sitting on a table. The woman who answered the phone was like.."didn't you call..." SMH. Food was cold. Probably had been sitting there for 10 minutes. It was good for cold burgers. 35 dollars for two burgers with a $5 carry out tip...expected better.</Text>< pictures>

<username>Debra Olson</username><Review>One of my favorite restaurants!  Not only do they let you bring your dog (when eating on the patio), but when they learned it was my birthday they basically treated me like royalty!  They were super sweet to the rest of the group too, especially to my toddler.  And the food was amazing!  Large portions of delicious things are a dangerous combination!<//Review><UserId.>107035837804796609999</UserId.></record>

Very nice staff. I've never eaten there before and I must say it was really good. We arrived when they opened and they immediately came out to let us know that it was take out only and allowed us to sit and figure out the website and get our order in. Then, they came back out to get our name and were so kind to us. Then, they brought our food to our car. We tailgated and ate in the parking lot. It was really good food. Very large drinks and super great customer service. They really have a good variety of food. And a puppy menu, which our lil puppy loves. I will definitely be eating their now that I know its awesome.</review>

Favorite bar . Not competition! It may be small and narrow but the drinks are full of flavor. The bar if filled with hidden treasures; like the reverse labels on the bottles behind the bar.<//Review>

Quite a few options for different tastes. They seemed to have narrowed their menu since Covid though, which is understandable.
Their veggie burger is really great!< /text>

Picked up my order curbside so I didn't have to navigate a the people to get my order. Even as busy as they were our food was ready in 20 minutes and my order was accurate. When we got it home it was packaged nicely and had everything we needed. The food was fantastic, as usual.<//Review><Name>April Brown</Name><response>None<//response><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUCxiziUFD6ad1-yajfWT25cdE8gdL42v8Pm-x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbOclXmMsKq5550MP0cEPMEMP1csBvA1Q-k09Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures></record>

This was a sub-par meal at best. Seemed that a waitress had a bit of an attitude, which I never get, it affects their profit.

The service was top notch but the dinner I ordered had bit to be desired. Ordered the chicken cordon blue. The wild rice with vegetables that was served on the side was delicious. The chicken however, was much worse. The chicken was like when your mom would make shake and bake pork chops. Crusty and extremely dry. The cheese was one slice laid on top. Was not melted on. That was disappointing. Would go back but not order that again.< /text>

The Food and the Atmosphere are awesome here. Attentive staff and a dog friendly patio make this a must visit for dog lovers. They have a large menu with a wide variety of California Cuisine Classics all made fresh with local meats and produce. So Many Great Flavors to choose from the only difficult thing is picking what you want off the menu without ordering more than you can eat. If you are ever in Rancho Cucamonga you should stop in for a Burger With Their Bark and Bite sauce. It's a spicy thousand island. Really hits the spot.

Still 100F outside though shaded with trees and our meals were good. We started with Moscow Mule and Tall Beer drinks. We had grilled chicken Caesar salad and chicken pot pie. The chicken was real, not processed and both meals had plenty of it. The service was good!</review>

Usually food is great... But I'll never get the meatloaf again.  It wasnt more that a dense meat patty stuffed with onions baked with some kind of bbq glaze no other visual veggie in the meatloaf.  It was also covered onion straws and a few pieces of carrots.  It didn't taste like meatloaf - it was an onion loaf...  the spinach and mashed potatoes were excellent but the onion loaf overwhelmed the palate.< /text>

Lazy Dog has a great outdoor dining venue during these times. Patio heaters and a fire pit add to warmth and ambiance. Servers are friendly, accommodating and observe all safety protocols. They have great food, esp if you like appetizers and small plates.</Review>

So first of all it was my family’s first time eating here (a mistake!) We were seated as we called ahead of time to have available seats.The drinks were the first we had to order, I had ordered the bonita alcoholic beverage and my wife had a coffee.off the bat the beer tasted stale and the coffee is terrible.The starters they sold to us were not even worth the price the coconut shrimp were over fried and dry.in general dissatisfied and for a beef dip sandwich I had ordered it tasted like a sour pungent taste (the cheese looked moldy!) I rate this place 0!Stars.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Traveling from Santa Barbara to Palm Springs, our party of 9 had lunch at Lazy Dog in Rancho Cucamonga today. We were seated outside very quickly and had an awesome waiter by the name of KENNY B.  He was seriously the BEST waiter we have had in a loooong time!  So much so, that I had to take the time to let the GM Jeremy know what a great employee he has. If only he could clone him, that would be perfect!  KENNY is definitely the kind of employee that deserves being recognized  and thanked for his fabulous service.  Lazy Dog is lucky to have him and we’re lucky to have  been helped by him today.  Keep up the great work, KENNY!  You’re a rare Customer Service gem who does not go unnoticed!

I love the food here! Always so good, first time at this location and it was a great expierance. Jacob was our server very nice and friendly and when there was a little mix up in the kitchen and we were stuck waiting the manager Jeremy came right out and told us and covered our entrees! We didn't expect that it was so nice he was so friendly and just a great manager. We got the puppy some beef, my husband got the black and blue burger with fries and I got the black and blue pizza and some really nice hot cocoa ❤😊< /review>

I ask for steak and he show me the meats menu section, but I wasn't in mood for a big one so I ask for a steak sandwich and he said there is none but then I found a pot roast dip sandwich, amazing. It comes with fries or salad, we chose salad and wife a fried chicken sandwich. Everything was amazing. We didn't wait for table, just go to bar area and get a hight table available.
Will come back for more...< /text>< Pics>

Its just Chilis or Applebee's if the restaurants actually tried making the food and didn't microwave them. Unthematic random hodgepodge of American menu items . If you walked into Bj's or here blindfolded you probably wouldn't notice the difference. Good food and good service but don't come here for something new.

Ps: No it isn't a hot dog restaurant like the name might lead you to believe.< /Text>

Great service, great food, group of 6 people and no one had anything bad to say about the meal. Not much talking, too busy munching! I had the BBQ Baby Back Ribs and enjoyed the crispy yet tender experience. I would recommend this restaurant to others.<//Text>

This restaurant consistently exceeds all our expectations. The staff is helpful and friendly, the ambiance is great. For appetizers we had calamari strips and deviled eggs. My wife had the Buffalo burger and I had the Pot roast, they were absolutely outstanding! My wife and I keep going back to this restaurant, because we won't be disappointed and the cost is so reasonable. Great experience,<//text>

We shared a couple of appetizers -- sweet potato tots & chicken lettuce wraps.  Both were really tasty, along with the Sangria's that they offer on the cocktail menu.  I am a huge fan of Sangria, and it was tasty.  I generally go for red sangria, but I did taste the White Peach and it was really good.  They have a decent selection of beer and other craft cocktails.  We went for dessert -- it was a seasonal one that was a white chocolate pretzel cheesecake.  OMG.  It was SUPER rich, and scrumptious!  I can't really describe how delicious it was, but if you have the hankering for something sweet and love cheesecake -- try this version!< /review><Date>1504537451635< /Date></record></dataset><record>

This restaurant went all out to make sure COVID-19 doesn't prevent it from closing. Average wait time with all employees wearing masks. Food was delicious and beer was great. While dining in doors is closed, Lazy Dog made eating outside comfortably easy to enjoy! Will definitely come back soon!<//text>

Food was good and the atmosphere was great. The wait staff were very slow with our order and didn't check in on us at all, although they seemed adequately staffed. Might have just been an off night, will try again.< /review>

Authentic Cuban restaurant that is lived by the community! Almost every local we encountered recommended Versailles.
When we got there, although it was a busy dinner season, we were shown to our seat (without reservations) almost immediately! It is a big restaurant and there is ample space for customers.
All staff members were very polite and ready to treat you with care and respect.<//Review>

Worth a visit if you've never been there. You don't have to like dogs to enjoy the food and atmosphere. Good appetizers, food, dessert, drinks and more! Outside seat allows you to bring your dog and they serve the dogs water and treats! This place has delicious sauces! Umami sauce is the best with the Cajun seasoned fries are so good. The burgers and pizza are good. The butter cake is the best! Always a great experience.</text>

It was also a bit chilli but the heat lamps were not evenly spaced. My chicken tortilla soap was brought out room temperature at best. My friends long island ice tea was gross tasted like brown tap water. Service was lacking. Maybe the location I hope all Lazy Dogs aren't as such.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>This place is amazing! It was my first time there and they gave us complimentary appetizers for our first time there. It is like a cabin rustic type restaurant. You can even bring your dogs their too of course only patio seating. They also have food for dogs as well. Recommend 10/10< /review>< Pics>

Great food, good beer selection and awesome service!

I had their taste tray and enjoyed it. It's not the ground breaking beer you would find in today's microbreweries but, it was pretty good.

The food is excellent though! I will definitely come back when I am in town again.<//text>

After ive made the drive , yesterday it was a 30 mins after i placed the order and it said it had been accepted. The option should be removed from YELP if they dont work together.

I love it here. Especially since they have a two-options menu for my dog and the food is great. I always order the salmon w rice and veggie cuz it's my favorite dish. The servers are always nice and welcoming and they even offer tiny plates of food for my one-year old daughter. I've been here multiple times w my bf and my family, and they've never failed to meet our expectations. The drinks and dessert are soo amazing!< /Text>

<Review>Even thought the server didn't understand me or were distracted. I ask for steak and he show me the meats menu section, but I wasn't in mood for a big one so I ask for a steak sandwich and he said there is none but then I found a pot roast dip sandwich, amazing. It comes with fries or salad, we chose salad and wife a fried chicken sandwich. Everything was amazing. We didn't wait for table, just go to bar area and get a hight table available.
Will come back for more...<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhSNDV3BlrqhOgGvvCNZ4kmMAgEw-trRlWrhvT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmX2E2x-rPjF3yOt3eTyfvNnmi_X1uMCMBezov=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEGDUlGEyRHA2XWAzWiCKZ9nKYxuQuxgTTfj32=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLxi7uK0NbcpOGySLXrMxIjTTS1rJwaRwqke0A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN74fQ3-J2LaD_NMGTjYMA3O_FlLVcJjf2Z8art=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMJ7Y73hBuDiEoNWGWnjtzDByGYDsoPDNK8h6y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPRYi0JdoelDUWXJvRGAX6qqEwuLPAbqPLnDYE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM46qehyY1q62Z8bclmMD03XC0zMvhC37v3XbKm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3kCxjwS3PleLSuwILn2URC45kAOdzO826u2Gp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGdX2qSodiSH40k62VYCXV3Fk-khgWJxtU5Lk6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c33580dd3c8201:0x658f66bcc2c1a8e0< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Best experience ever. First time out in months. Covid19, precautions are great, we felt very safe.
Lazy Dog is my new favorite place to eat. Our server Kenny was wonderful. He was kind, happy and very attentive. Felt like VIP.
Walking in the door, the aroma from the kitchen smelled so good. The food was amazing. We had the Chicken Parmesan and the Fish Taco's. Did not disappoint. And the Butter cake for dessert was out of this world.  Thanks for a great dining experience.
I have to give it 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🙌🙌< /review>

Great venue with a beautiful outside seating area. Ordered two burgers medium. My wife's came out cold and pink. They took it back immediately, no questions ask. Server and manger came out, and took care of the problem very professionally. Didnt charge us for that meal. And threw in some desert to go. Would come back just for this. Pro tip (Order your burger medium well)</text>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>4 stars from me because few restaurants cater to people with non-service dogs. If you bring your dog, you’ll be seated on the patio, but they provide heaters for chilly days. Dogs get their own menu!

The food is your average new Californian fare: Burgers, Asian fusion style dishes, seafood, pasta, and of course steaks.<//review>< name>

<Review>I have always been a hesitant about going. I wish it would have been a little better experience. Lighting was not really great it was dark they could have better lighting. It was also a bit chilli but the heat lamps were not evenly spaced. My chicken tortilla soap was brought out room temperature at best. My friends long island ice tea was gross tasted like brown tap water. Service was lacking. Maybe the location I hope all Lazy Dogs aren't as such.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>I stopped in for lunch at 1:00 on a Thursday. I was able to find a seat in the self seating section right away. I had the sweet potato tater tots, the burrata and heirloom beet salad, and the street corn wheels. The salad and corn wheels were from the seasonal menu. Everything was delicious! I really loved the corn wheels. Those should be on the regular menu. My server, Robbie J., was awesome. He was very friendly!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWYB696CSk9tGH4LSmZdvhvQpBIpD5EXGLeKn4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Rate>

<Review>Great happy hour; a lot of different spins on standard food items.

I tried the sticky Ribs, which had an Asian flavor. My wife also has recently tried the Chicken Fried steak, which unexpectedly tasted a lot like a chicken and waffles plate.

The food is good, but we both felt both plates were overly sweet for dinner items. The ribs are begging for spice, and the chicken fried steak notes white gravy (suggesting a savory dish). Both plates were great, just constructive criticism.</Review>< username>

<Text>The only thing I have that's good to say about it is my server was very polite and professional and accommodating ranch dressing was very weak, my tortilla soup was Bland and thin. The lemonade strawberry lemonade was very good but then again it should be at 4 bucks did include free refills I had two total because I really didn't finish my food. Total cost for my meal was about 12:50 plus the tip</Text><time>1538517943644<//time>< Pictures>

<Review>The service was great 👍 . The food was even better. I ordered the chicken sandwich and definitely will be coming back to eat it again. The coleslaw they put inside the sandwich is what literally makes it a good choice to eat. I also ordered a mango margarita 🍹 rimmed with tajin instead of salt and it was also a good choice & they aren't greedy with the alcohol.  I am a very happy person after eating there 😁<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c33580dd3c8201:0x658f66bcc2c1a8e0< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>First time dinning here, it was packed, but we got seated quick. Our waitress was very professional, knowledgeable and welcomed us with a happy smile the whole experience.  Food was very good and tasty, great presentation.  Liled the country-style decor.  I'm a dog lover and was impressed that you can dine with your fury family outside in the terrace/patio.  I can't wait to bring my babies.  I ordered the Cucumber-Thyme Sparkling Lemonade 🍋 YUM! and the Thai Chicken Salad, great choice, for dessert the Apple-pie with Vanilla Ice cream, delicious!  Definitely will be back!<//text>< GmapID>

Saw this place after shopping nearby at the mills, didnt know anything about it so decided to check it out. Arrived and there was quite a wait for sitting indoors, so we opted to sit outside. It was nice cus this place lets you bring your dog to sit outside with you. The outside patio was open and vibrant. Our waitress was superb. Told us there was 10 minutes left on the brunch menu so we got a couple drinks which were fantastic. The restaurant manager came by and introduced himself as it was our first time, and even brought us a complimentary plate of garlic chips. Everything we ordered was amazing and we left full and satisfied. Will definitely be coming back< /Text>

Service, food, atmosphere was all fine. However, they did not accept my e-gift cards. Went to Lazy Dog a number of times and never ran into this issue. Seems to be a unique policy for this location.</Text>

< Review>
Went as part of a group of six on a fairly busy evening. We were seated and served much faster than I expected. The server was attentive without hovering, and she acted quickly on any requests we had.

I had the pot roast and was quite happy with my selection. The meat was tender, the vegetables cooked just right, and the portion size was perfect. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food as well.

As much as I liked the food, my favorite part of the meal was the house-made ginger beer (non-alcoholic). I love ginger beer, and have had many different brands, but Lazy Dog's is my favorite. It is nice and spicy, without being too sweet or having the touch of bitterness that I often find with very gingery ginger beer. They serve it over ice and garnished with lime slices. Next time I'm looking forward to trying one of their mules.

I will very happily return to Lazy Dog in the future.</Review>

Lazy Dogs is the home of the Ontario Reign hockey team after game retreat. Lazy Dogs is an up scale of a BJ's. Great food, good service but when real busy they tend to forget about you for a little bit. But overall service, they're great and real friendly. Drinks are great and prices are reasonable. Also, when the weather permits, you can bring your dog and enjoy the evening out on the terrace.</review>

Great bar for locals and out of towners
Good food, no drama, to watch a game at the bar.
The veggie burgers and veggie options on the menu to satisfy anyone hungry and concern about they are consuming...< /review>

I love the Peach sangria.  The food is very good. I have been to the one in Montclair and Chino, and for being a busy restaurant, the service has been pretty quick.  Faster than other restaurants.< /Text>

<Review>Best clam chowder I have ever tasted. Very clammy and chowdery. The viscosity is just right. When I scrape the inside of the bread bowl and get some of that delicious chowder soaked bread, I put it in my mouth and close my eyes for a moment to take it all in. My taste buds are dancing. It's lit. They are swimming in a sea of clam chowder. I feel like everything in the world is perfect. And then I open my eyes and I come back to the world. I take another bite, close my eyes, and lose awareness of my surrounding.< /Review>< name>

< Review>
I never heard of Lazy Dog until I got a gift card from some friends for my birthday last November, so, we gave them a try. When I first heard the name, I thought it was some kind of gourmet hot dog joint.  We discovered that people were allowed to bring their dogs into the restaurant with them. I was really impressed with some of the animals that were in there. For dinner I had a magnificent Chicken fried Chicken which was awesome, however our waitress seem to disappear for long periods of time.  There was however another really hard working waiter who was able to pick up the slack and take care of our needs in between our waitresses absences. Overall the experience was really nice and we enjoy the architecture and the outdoor patio with fire pit.<//Review>

I started with my go-to brussell sprouts appetizer. Perfect veggie starter. I followed with the butternut squash soup. Not too bad, a little sweet and lacking some seasoning. I finished with the Spaghetti Squash and Beet Balls. I was pleasantly surprised! The spaghetti  squash and thinly sliced zucchini topped with the Mediterranean spiced Beet Balls definitely had more flavor than I anticipated!< /Review><Rating>4<//Rating><user>112922224322731164161</user><gmap_id>0x80c33580dd3c8201:0x658f66bcc2c1a8e0<//gmap_id>< Time>

Great food, fantastic workers, laid back atmosphere that allows doggies! (Outside of course). Had the fish and chips, delicious! This makes my top 3 of all places for fish and chips, give the other 2 are in Alaska. My fiancee had the bacon wrapped bison meatloaf. I gotta say that was freaking amazing! Totally wasn't expecting the awesome flavors that exploded in my mouth. Try this place, you won't be disappointed.</Text>

<Review>Came in on a weeknight and they were pretty busy. Sat at a table in the bar after they said it would be a 15 minute wait. Got the notice our table was ready after about 5 minutes. Service was quick and friendly. We got the brussel sprouts and I got the steak salad. Both were great. Prices weren't bad for the quality. It was a little warm out, otherwise I would have loved to sit on the patio.</Review>< pictures>

Ok, we love this restaurant, wait is prettyong on Saturdays if u want to be seated around 4-8pm "peak dinner hours" but mostly anytime after 9pm, you get seated fairly quickly. Service in Rancho Cucamonga was awesomely great, by Alexis, he is the bomb. Quick, friendly,kind, he listens, & remembers ur drinks & brings ur refills quick. Food is good, most everything is pretty tasty & the Mango Chili Margarita is so good. Been there twice so far within these four weeks, definitely will be going back.</Review>

Well... Here it comes. Everything here tasted like a glorified applebee's... In the way it tasted microwaved. I was with a friend and both of us didn't care for our meals. She had some Thai noodles, I had ribs with umami fries. That sauce just does not slap. If you enjoy it, by all means, it's okay to enjoy it... Just know you are being lied to. There are such better options for ribs.
I guess when you go here, you're moreso paying for the experience... Which was just okay? Like I've been inside of olive garden's as exciting. Playing a game on a tv doesn't equate to a fun, lively night.

The drinks.... Man how sad. It's one of those places that charge big money for drinks but taste like a watered down wine cooler. The alcohol content is present but... So lacking.

Overall, we tried this place instead of our usual spot because covid still has them unable to seat people, but this was a sad reminder of why trying new places isn't always the plan to go with. Why does this get 2 stars then and not a 1?

The staff is fantastic! So funny, witty, charming, respectful, timely, and I can't stress enough that this review isn't any staffs fault. Not even the chefs. Whatever menu they gotta run, well they are doing it. For better or worse. It is sure getting done< /Text>

There's some sticker shock of the prices but the food is very good. The homemade ginger beer was awesome. I am a fan of their black and blue pizza; I'm a fan of blue cheese.   I like the idea and supported humanity project with gingerbread house...too bad it needs more frosting to stay up.</review>

Dining in is open for the patio area. There is a large covered patio and the walkway has added tables with umbrellas an trees offering shade. I recommend the seared ahi tuna salad. The salad was crisp, cool and delicious.</text>

< Review>
I never heard of Lazy Dog until I got a gift card from some friends for my birthday last November, so, we gave them a try. When I first heard the name, I thought it was some kind of gourmet hot dog joint.  We discovered that people were allowed to bring their dogs into the restaurant with them. I was really impressed with some of the animals that were in there. For dinner I had a magnificent Chicken fried Chicken which was awesome, however our waitress seem to disappear for long periods of time.  There was however another really hard working waiter who was able to pick up the slack and take care of our needs in between our waitresses absences. Overall the experience was really nice and we enjoy the architecture and the outdoor patio with fire pit.< /Review>

Nice comfortable atmosphere, with only a 20 minute wait.  Not bad for how busy it was.</Text>

Nice place. Food was great. Been there a couple of times before and have seen others bring their dogs. First time we took one of ours. I was surprised that they have a menu for the dogs.< /text>

While visiting CA recently we ate at the Lazy Dog in Rancho. The atmosphere was relaxed and comfy. The food was very good, but the real reason I’m writing this review is because of our server! BRIAN, BRIAN, BRIAN!!!! He was absolutely the best server we’ve ever had!  I sure hope he hears about my review! Brian, thank you for your kindness.....it meant so much to me!< /Review>

Excellent customer service. The well never dried up!  Continually checked on by staff and managers to make sure everything is good.   Highly recommend. Dogs are welcome on an outside patio area which is very clean. Even dog food and water given to dogs.< /Text>

My favorite dish here is the Thai noodles which is basically pad thai. Not bad for a non Thai restaurant! Lazy Dog also has mimosa flights!</review>

This restaurant is according to ppl is the best Cuban restaurant in Miami.  Always full and the food is indeed good. The service however is not the best. Our server was not smiling at all and we had to wait long to give the order or water refill. But once you order, they are pretty fast to bring the food.
At the same time, I understand, it is pretty busy.
You get what you pay for I guess.
It is a good cuban restaurant in the overa< /text>

<Date>1574654398128< /Date><Text>Excellent time at Lazy Dog. We were outside with our puppy.  The heaters were nice, felt like 80° and was super relaxing. They offer dog food for lunch and dinner.

I enjoyed the huge portion of ribs and my wife had the lemon chicken, which was big as well.
The wait staff is friendly and checks on you ever other walk by. Busy place and I see why, with the delicious food. Try the humus appetizer.</Text><user_name>Nicholas S</user_name><GmapID>0x80c33580dd3c8201:0x658f66bcc2c1a8e0< /GmapID><response>None<//response><UserId.>112044054935310434730< /UserId.>< Pics>

Very good service and the wait was not long at all for a week night.
Everything was pretty good except the drink. I ordered the 🍓 strawberry citrus soda and there was not enough strawberry puree. I asked for more puree and the girl have me more whole strawberries... Better luck next time... Food was fantastic.<//text>

Got to check out Versailles Restaurant in Miami a month ago and this place did not disappoint us at all! We came here straight from the airport and it took about 10-15 minutes from MIA. There's two locations here but we decided to go for the restaurant to sit down and eat. The other one is a bakery only so if you want to sit down then come to this restaurant!< /Text>

<Text>I first have to say how awesome it is to bring my dog to a dine-in restaurant during the COVID-19 pandemic. We're seated outside at this time and the servers are doing their best but I am however disappointed in the treatment/service we have received. Our drink was delicous, I have to add, with the exception of some plastic debris which made it's way to my girlfriend's mouth! We let the server know and we only expected a replacement which is quite reasonable. Instead, they brought back the same cup with a watered down version of the drink. Obviously, it's not what we're paying for. Keep in mind, the original drink was half full. They bring back a new freshly made drink all the while the server's co-workers are angrily talking and pointing in my direction from afar. One of them is even acting confrontational enough for my dog to bark. To add insult to injury, the check has both drinks charged!< /Text>< date>

Jamaican Lemonade Crazy good! Had the veggie burger that was the best I've had outside my own! The only reason there isn't a picture of it was because I ate it fast. And this was my 2nd JL drink. Lol<//review>

Ordered chicken pot pie for delivery. Always love eating at Lazy Dog. But why was there no chicken in my chicken pot pie. I searched under the topping, all through the filling. NO chicken. How can you prepare a chicken pot pie without chicken?

I do want to give a shout out to Jeremy. I had received my Door Dash with no utensils. Upon hearing this he apologized and offered to drop them at the hotel we were staying at. Thank you! I only wish I knew my chicken pot pie had no chicken. I am sure he would have resolved that as well, but unfortunately the restaurant was then closed.< /review>

It was our daughther's 14th Birthday on Easter Sunday and we were across the street at the mall when we call Lazy Dog to find out the wait time. When the hostess answered the phone she told my husband that the wait time was between 15 to 20 mins. We cross the street and head to be put down for a table for four. The hostess turns to me and tells me that the wait is between 40 mins to and hour. Keep in mind that it hasn't even been 5mins since we called. Of course I was pretty upset and I asked to speak to a manager.  The manager was very understanding and within 10 min we had our table. . . The Peach Sangria was awesome and it made the dinner experience way better.<//text>

<Text>While daughter loves this restaurant,  I do not. It took 1.5 hours to get a table, because it's so popular,  I think not. After getting our drinks we waited for half an hour to order. Our waiter never came back, my wife had to ask a different waiter to take our order. Maybe that's why it takes 1.5 hours to get a table, you have wait over an hour to get your food. My daughter may go back but I am done.<//Text>< pics>

Very good service and the wait was not long at all for a week night.
Everything was pretty good except the drink. I ordered the 🍓 strawberry citrus soda and there was not enough strawberry puree. I asked for more puree and the girl have me more whole strawberries... Better luck next time... Food was fantastic.< /Review>

Excellent customer service. The well never dried up!  Continually checked on by staff and managers to make sure everything is good.   Highly recommend. Dogs are welcome on an outside patio area which is very clean. Even dog food and water given to dogs.</Text>

<Text>What can I say? My first time at Lazy Dog and it was a phenomenal experience. My sister and I were treated by the Restaurant Manager and given great service. I also want to give a HUGE shoutout to Jose A. For the best dang steak I've ever tasted. You have 100% earned this customer's retention.  I will be back.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

This was our first time here but it definitely will not be the last time.  We were asked if this was our first time here and it was and to our surprise the manager came over and introduced his self and brought to our table a complimentary order of Garlic Waffle Chips that was so nice and we appreciated that extra Thank You!< /text>

This place is great. I would definitely come back here again. Nice atmosphere.  The food was delicious. I loved the wings. They have a good selection of types of food to choose from. The hamburgers are amazing, very tender and juicy. They also a nice size variety of alcoholic beverages to choose from as well, that are great too. Our waiter was polite and attentive to our needs and requests. This is definitely a place to come visit!!</Text>

While visiting CA recently we ate at the Lazy Dog in Rancho. The atmosphere was relaxed and comfy. The food was very good, but the real reason I’m writing this review is because of our server! BRIAN, BRIAN, BRIAN!!!! He was absolutely the best server we’ve ever had!  I sure hope he hears about my review! Brian, thank you for your kindness.....it meant so much to me!< /Review>

< Review>
Excellent time at Lazy Dog. We were outside with our puppy.  The heaters were nice, felt like 80° and was super relaxing. They offer dog food for lunch and dinner.

I enjoyed the huge portion of ribs and my wife had the lemon chicken, which was big as well.
The wait staff is friendly and checks on you ever other walk by. Busy place and I see why, with the delicious food. Try the humus appetizer.</Review>

We came here straight from the airport and it took about 10-15 minutes from MIA. There's two locations here but we decided to go for the restaurant to sit down and eat.

We're seated outside at this time and the servers are doing their best but I am however disappointed in the treatment/service we have received. Our drink was delicous, I have to add, with the exception of some plastic debris which made it's way to my girlfriend's mouth! We let the server know and we only expected a replacement which is quite reasonable. Instead, they brought back the same cup with a watered down version of the drink. Obviously, it's not what we're paying for. Keep in mind, the original drink was half full. They bring back a new freshly made drink all the while the server's co-workers are angrily talking and pointing in my direction from afar. One of them is even acting confrontational enough for my dog to bark. To add insult to injury, the check has both drinks charged!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>It was our daughther's 14th Birthday on Easter Sunday and we were across the street at the mall when we call Lazy Dog to find out the wait time. When the hostess answered the phone she told my husband that the wait time was between 15 to 20 mins. We cross the street and head to be put down for a table for four. The hostess turns to me and tells me that the wait is between 40 mins to and hour. Keep in mind that it hasn't even been 5mins since we called. Of course I was pretty upset and I asked to speak to a manager.  The manager was very understanding and within 10 min we had our table. . . The Peach Sangria was awesome and it made the dinner experience way better.</Text><name>M. Cervantes<//name><Time>1556037048950</Time>< Pictures>

What off stage show me it's like a 747 flying like urine and it s but then the doctor took samples of leominster nutrient solution was canceled but there was another medical sweep the whole tour the album reached Americaas it had broken limbs fat blunt and illegal substances to record a song with Wendy owilliams it look like the band might finally fall apart you consider how awesome Wendy Williams Williams is awesome play fast Eddie didn't think it was such an awesome idea that sound puppet money brought in thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson things got worse I agree. I'm so sorry. I guess I can drive is Jack Ryan was fine until Campbell's wife took a surprise phone call so I can have any albums by the following from 3 to mr. Lee Jones firing radio<//text>

<Text>As an animal lover, I loved the restaurant, Friendly and clean environment. Since it was my first time there I had asked what were some of the top selling plates. Out of the four that she mentioned, I choose the chicken and biscuit plate for brunch. The plate was delicious. For people who have well behaved dogs, I recommend this place.</Text><UserId.>117071502084771054393< /UserId.>< Name>

This was our first time at this restaurant.  We are impressed. Love the atmosphere.  The staff is friendly. And they took the time to answer questions and make suggestions.  We even got a couple of samples on the house.  The food is very good. The menu has a lot of unique creations. We will be back to try more next time we are in the area.  Wish we had a location in Phoenix,  Arizona.  Thank you< /Review>

Nice brunch menu. Food was very flavorful. The brunch mixed drinks are a great price for $5 but they are not that great in taste. We tried the bloody mary, michelada, and sangria, all tasted watered down. Overall not a bad place for brunch.<//Review>

<Review>The lazy dog restaurant located North of the Ontario Mills is a home grown restaurant chain started by a man named Chris Simms. The first restaurant opened in Huntington beach in 2003, and now they are  seemingly everywhere in different cities and different states. Stylistically, the interior and exterior was inspired by Chris' time spent in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Though the restaurant feels modern, there are definitely lodge/ranch  vibes throughout. There's lots of wood, raw timber, and some stone everywhere. Now the food is something else. They practically serve everything under the sun, ranging from Japanese, to Thai, to Tex-Mex. And for fun, why not add  some Cajun, and Southern style into the mix (theres even a menu for the dogs). But keeping within the ranch vibe, they serve an impressive array of proteins like bison (buffalo), wild boar, and even lamb, thats in addition to the standard beef, pork, chicken, and fish. If you though the Lazy Dog was lazy, think  again.
Drink wise, the Lazy Dog has an impressive bar area. They have a full bar (they can mix any drink you want), a bunch of beers on tap, and they even have their own inhouse beer. Check this place out, they practically have everything covered for your dining and social enjoyment.<//Review>< Response>

Tried the meatloaf tonight and it was very good. They add BBQ sauce which was different but very tasty.  Also, sign up for the lazy dog beer club. We got a free small plate with the membership.< /Text>

I have eaten here three or four times now and have never been disappointed. Pretty much everything on the menu is great. I'm not even that big on dogs but as long as you stay inside it is like a normal restaurant. The patio is nice on days with good weather though. Highly recommend over all.< /Text>

We were visiting a friend and he recommended going to Lazy Dog for dinner. The place had great atmosphere and friendly service. We ordered several small plates and beers. This is a brewery and they had a great selection. The service was fast and attentive. The food was above average.< /Review>

My friend and I shared a huckleberry mule which was quite tasty. I had the pretzel bites and cheese. The pretzels were fresh. The cheese was pretty good but I would have preferred a little spice or zest. My friend had the bison burger. He said it was great. It wasn't a large portion though. We shared the cajun fries which were yummy. Our daughter had the butternut squash soup and mac and cheese. The soup was good but quite sweet. It tasted like dessert. She liked the mac and cheese but wished she would have asked to leave out the bacon because it made the dish so salty.< /Text>< Pictures>

We enjoyed our late-night beers and snack experience. Beer beer selection includes most traditional beer styles but is limited in nature; guest tap list includes various large brewer famous brands. happy hour starts again at 9 p.m. and we took advantage of the cheap appetizer plates. The food was very good but the service was quite slow at 9:30 pm.<//review>

Thank you Jamie for taking good care of us. As out of town era, we are always skeptical  of trying new places; however, Lazy Dog did not disappoint. There was something on the menu for everyone in our party of 5. The veggie burger and fish tacos were very flavorful. I would definitely recommend to others and be back when we are in town.</Text>

Lazy Dog is always a nice restaurant. The food is always good and the service is always excellent. The patio outside is a great place to sit when it's warm and sunny. You can bring your dogs and they even have a special dog food menu. The menu seems to rotate fairly frequently and the food is always something unique and prepared well.< /text>

<Response>None< /Response><review>This place has an awesome vibe and the best part is you're able to bring that special addition of your family there: your dog! The patio area has a fire pit which you can chill there with your dog. Staff is friendly and they'll bring you water in a bowl so your dog has something to drink :). They also have a couple options of food that you you could give to your dog as well. The one I got is chicken and brown rice option for my Husky/Akita. I will definitely be back!< /review><rating>5</rating><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNL9dp6E9QVnuhBmAOGtlo2XB1BzvmeE87DZoW3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdBB-I_J8tsr8VdXMePEdOzAnZkWRDJshlaTCs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I don’t know why we hadn’t gone sooner! They are extremely dog-friendly, with a large, attractive outdoor patio space where people can eat with their furry friends. The wait staff seemed well-versed in handling dogs and disagreements between them. They brought water for dogs and there is even a dog menu. The food on the human menu is excellent, with a number of delicious vegetarian options and seasonal dishes. They have an extensive list of beers and wines, and the desserts are heavenly! I will definitely go again!<//review>

Pretty good food and excellent service. The ambience was nice. It waa a little loud and hard to hear my friend talk. That's okay, though. A crowded place means a good place, usually. Good location. Easy to find. I would definitely recommend to others.<//Text>

We were visiting a friend and he recommended going to Lazy Dog for dinner. The place had great atmosphere and friendly service. We ordered several small plates and beers. This is a brewery and they had a great selection. The service was fast and attentive. The food was above average. A usual spot to stop before a trip from Ontario back to Sacramento via Southwest. Great friendly greeting, quickly move to our booth, friendly server, good food, reasonably priced.< /text>

My experience at this restaurant was fantastic. The wait was around 20 min for a table for 2 on a Saturday night, which isn't bad at all in this area. The atmosphere is quiet and dim..cozy. I didn't go to the bar but I did see a nice stocked round bar and I can't remember if they had TV's. everything on the menu looks good but I got the pot roast and my girlfriend got the steak. Both plates were good. The house beer was surprisingly better than good. Overall it's a really nice restaurant and the staff was awesome. Our waiter was helpful and courteous.. I'll definitely be coming here again.< /Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Review>To start, when asked to wait for 20 minutes, we had to provide our cell number in order to be called. After 25+ minutes passed and seeing others who came into the restaurant after us being seated, I approached the desk host who stated someone "pretended" to be us and was seated. (Can't see how that's possible if I never received a text).  Once seated, we ordered the mini corndogs as an appetizer.  When we got them, they were cold, and the bater tasted as if it was cooked in two day old oil.
My wife ordered the roast beef and she said it was tasty. I had the turkey burger, and it was decent.  (Nothing to write home about on that).  I had a side salad, which tasted as if it picked straight from a garden.... ( but missed a water rinse).<//Review>< rate>

The Food at Lazy Dog Ontario is as impressive as other locations. Great service. I've haven't taken my dog there as she's not only finicky but can be violent as she's a rescue so I can't say much about that part of their experience.</Review>

The wait staff seemed well-versed in handling dogs and disagreements between them. They brought water for dogs and there is even a dog menu. The food on the human menu is excellent, with a number of delicious vegetarian options and seasonal dishes. They have an extensive list of beers and wines, and the desserts are heavenly! I will definitely go again!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We were visiting a friend and he recommended going to Lazy Dog for dinner. The place had great atmosphere and friendly service. We ordered several small plates and beers. This is a brewery and they had a great selection. The service was fast and attentive. The food was above average. A usual spot to stop before a trip from Ontario back to Sacramento via Southwest. Great friendly greeting, quickly move to our booth, friendly server, good food, reasonably priced.< /review>

Food was great. Ambience is nice until the manager allowed one couple to light up the fire pit at 88F deg. When requesting to lower the flames or turn it off, manager claimed he could do nothing because a customer requested but yet the 10 of us were being seriously affected. Not to mention other customers.<//Text>

My favorite plate is Sticky Ribs, all center cut meaty ribs flash-fried so it is crispy outside, brushed with their own molasses sauce, it truly is finger-licking good. Pot Pie is another great choice.<//review>< Name>

The food was so tasty, I loved their pita bread with marinara sauce! It was our first time here, and the waiter was so kind and helpful. They've got this craft beer that has a hint of cedar/pine flavor in it, and it was damn delucious!<//Text>

Unfortunately the food came undercooked. As in the seated ahk tuna salad had uncooked tuna on it. I called to correct this or get a replacement and was told they dont deliver despite it being on their website, I clearly JUST ordered ON YOUR WEBSITE. But they continued to insist they dont do delivery... then when I was put on hold for her to 'find a manager' she hung up after 5 minutes.

Excellent. Never had a bad meal here. For starters the Bacon candy is absolutely addictive. The burgers are extremely tasty and alway well cooked. The steaks are cooked to perfection with some of the most exceptional tender meat. The cocktails are great and they don't skimp on the pour.</text>

The ribs were ok and the coleslaw was disgusting. My daughter added the 2nd star because her kids meal was decent. The ambiance and seating was actually nice.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c33580dd3c8201:0x658f66bcc2c1a8e0< /gmapID></record>

We are frequent visitors. Everytime we come, we find open seating in the bar almost right away. Score! But besides that, we always have wonderful food, lovely service, and awesome beer! Every member of the staff we've come across is always kind, always helpful, and always smiling! We're also members of the beer club, and it's pretty sweet! 5/5 for this Lazy Dog team!< /review>

Great place. Pretty. Great happy hour drinks and good food. The garlic flatbread I would not recommend but otherwise I was impressed. The seasonal drinks are super tasty and the fake fireplace you can sit around looks great.</text>

Our server was nice and the food was good, but they gave us a "free" appetizer (it was our first time) only to charge us for it later. They also forgot my friend's drink and brought my husband the wrong one. Our server did apologize and offer to fix the bill, but we had to leave right away. :(<//Review>

Oh, and the Last Dog in West Covina invited patrons to submit pictures of their pets. I submitted a pic of my kitten and there flatly rejected it because they only want dog pics. Swear, I stopped going there for a couple years.<//text>< pics>

She made sure all our orders were correct. She also threw in some jokes and had us laughing, over all we had an amazing time. This was our first time coming here and well definitely be back!!

I really enjoy this place. The food has a little unique flair running through it and they have a nice selection of beers on tap. We had a wedding rehearsal dinner there with about 30 people and the service was prompt and courteous. Will definitely be back.< /review>

<text>Great food but service was a little slow albeit we were there on a Saturday night. Will definitely give them another visit when we're in the area. The fried deviled eggs were very tasty & a must try but beware; at $9 you only get 2eggs/4halves.</text>< userid>

Nice venue. They have outdoor seating as well as plenty of indoor seating and a bar area to watch the games. The service was pretty good. They made a mistake with my order but were quick to fix it without any hesitation. Would come back!<//Review>

Went for brunch with old friends.  We got there when they opened, but there was still a wait?  The waitress was great and attentive. I had the Cheesy Eggs and Avocado Toast.  It was good.  Nothing great, but I'd get it again.  We sat outside and it was a beautiful morning for it.  We didn't bring dogs but it's great to know that it's an option.< /Review>

A wonderful experience, the ambience was enjoyable, sat out on their deck with the heaters. It's a little cold (by California standards) today but the heaters helped immensely. The food was very good, the Cajun fries are wonderful and their selection of beer has something for everyone. Great service!<//review>

<text>Pretty neat patio when it's warm outside (they do have a big fire pit you can eat around when chilly which is nice).  The food is pretty average here, nothing to write home about.  Its really close to a bunch of hotels so if you are staying in the area it is very convenient.< /text>< Rating>

This was our third time visiting. The mango margarita was 🔥 as was the buffalo cauliflower. Lots of vegetarian and non vegetarian options which was great.  There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try it was hard to choose. Guess I'll have to keep coming back until I have tried them all. I had the vegetarian BBQ burger and my wife had the fish sandwich. My burger was good, but my wife let me try a bite of her fish sandwich and it was amazing. Probably going to get that next time.< /Text>

The Nashville Portabella was good but the batter needed a little work.Their hibiscus margarita and huckleberry IPA definitely hit the spot, both refreshing and delicious; the IPA had a prominent strawberry flavor. Carrot cake was out of this world, light and not to sweet but the buttercream made up for that. I loved it!<//Text>

This is my second time visiting The Dog. The idea of inviting "Man's Best Friend" to dine with us is novel and as an animal lover it really appeals to me and i love the wood and steel architecture. I choose restaurants for design and decor as well as the food. Everything I have tried was delicious and the portions are very generous.
Tonight we had Kristen for our server and she was exceptional. Quick and attentive with a great sense of humor. Rich and I will definitely return.</text>

I would always come for the hummus trio but unfortunately they took it off the menu witch I think was a mistake. I dont like the new way the are serving the hummus. Other then that the customer service is really good and the food is really good. I hope they can think about bringing that trio back to the menu.<//review></record>

Normally I Lazy Dog is very good. Tonight was not the case. Service was good but I ordered the sweet potato tots, sorry we've been out for over a month! Really? Then how leading of with, "I'm sorry we're out of our sweet potato tots today." I ordered the classic Chicken Pot Pie. The waiter came back a few minutes later to inform me, "I'm sorry we're out of that too!" We ordered at about 5pm, we'll before the warning in the menu about possibly being out of the pot pie after 9pm. Arg! I told the waiter to suggest something since I was striking out. He suggested the pot roast. Fine, I'll take that.
Plate came out fast! First bite, fat and grissle. That's what I was afraid of. I only ate about half and didn't find anymore grissle. The mashed potatoes were good along with the gravy having good flavor. The carrots on the other hand were way under cooked and very crunchy.
I've been to this restaurant many many times and have never experienced something like this.
We shall see if I return.</Text>

<Review>Went to Bevmo, Il Pastio in Beverly Hills and several other restaurants over the past two weeks and this location of Lazy Dog refused to sell my alchohol. Not sure why my paper temp ID is no good here, but no where else is it an issue.

Waited over an hour for this table of 6 for my wife's birthday and it deff has bothered our table. Kinda odd that they refused, even the manager coming over and giving me a quick speech about why he wont accept it and leaving my table before I can speak was quite nice.

Been here 3 times now, not sure if returning.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c33580dd3c8201:0x658f66bcc2c1a8e0<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>Their sneaky little  9:00 pm onward HAPPY HOUR is worth a look.   The food's great and when you're done there you can pretty much go anywhere. One night I left and drove all the way to Pasadena. PS great service too - especially at the bar.

<resp>None< /resp><Text>Stayed away from this place due to a poor first visit but after avoiding it for years finally gave them another shot and it's become a favorite. Menu options are diverse and there's options for everyone. Service and food quality is far above that first visit and hope it stays that way.  Great beer and cocktail menu but wine list could use more to choose from. Price is worth the quality and I'd choose this place over BJs (next door) any day.<//Text>< Rating>

I like the fact that they changed menus and now have seasonal items. I ordered the roasted chicken with these blackened roasted brussel sprouts that was served on a cast iron plate. It was so good. If you like rustic meals it is highly recommended. The cut was a leg/thigh portion that was mostly boneless. Seasoned with herbs and super tender.< /text>

Good little happy hour, good beers, customer service was top notch. Outdoor seating was nice, but tree sap was dripping down some and was a little uncomfortable. Got BUSY at some point, good energy.< /text>

<user_name>Timothy Kennedy<//user_name><review>This review is solely based on the brunch experience. We had the mimosa flight, and the cheesy eggs and avocado toast and boy was it worth it. The eggs here are better than anything I’ve ever tasted. The mimosa flight comes with a bottle of champagne and orange, huckleberry and one other juice that I can’t remember but it’s amazing. The prices are super reasonable too.<//review>< rating>

I absolutely love Lazy Dog, especially this location. The staff (especially Robbie[sp?]) Is just amazing. Everyone is  so very nice and accommodating. My only complaint would be that the street carrots/corn wheels are not a year round menu item. Lol.</review>

Love eating out @ Lazy Dog. Chicken wings, wok-fried calamari, and teriyaki chicken bowl are delicious. This place is conveniently located off Freeway 10 and 15. Getting a parking space could be challenging on busy days.</review>

<text>I really like this place. I have been coming here for a very long time just about since it opened. I would always come for the hummus trio but unfortunately they took it off the menu witch I think was a mistake. I dont like the new way the are serving the hummus. Other then that the customer service is really good and the food is really good. I hope they can think about bringing that trio back to the menu.<//text><Rate>4< /Rate><Date>1547586057146< /Date>< Name>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Went to Bevmo, Il Pastio in Beverly Hills and several other restaurants over the past two weeks and this location of Lazy Dog refused to sell my alchohol. Not sure why my paper temp ID is no good here, but no where else is it an issue.

Waited over an hour for this table of 6 for my wife's birthday and it deff has bothered our table. Kinda odd that they refused, even the manager coming over and giving me a quick speech about why he wont accept it and leaving my table before I can speak was quite nice.

Been here 3 times now, not sure if returning.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>First time trying this place, and it was phenomenal! Came during lunch rush, and was still seated within 5 minutes. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. The service was spectacular and the food was fresh and delicious. The plating and presentation of the food deserves a 10/10. Will definitely be coming back to try other items on their menu.</Review>< pics>

Love this place. Great food made fresh and at great prices. I like getting the Turkey sandwich it comes with bacon and avocado and it taste absolutely delicious. The freshness of the veggies is amazing. They also serve some great mixed drinks and they also offer non-alcoholic drinks that are fruity and delicious which I enjoyed while I was pregnant. I also love that we can bring our dog here and share a meal with him in the outside seating area, and even if we don't bring our dog we like looking at all the cute pups outside. It's one of the few places where pets are welcome that isn't a pet store.<//review>

The service of this restaurant was really wonderful. It is large and welcoming so you don't feel claustrophobic. The food was extremely flavorful and just the way it was ordered. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody that is looking for a great night out and possibly even a good date.</review>

<Text>Love eating out @ Lazy Dog. Chicken wings, wok-fried calamari, and teriyaki chicken bowl are delicious. This place is conveniently located off Freeway 10 and 15. Getting a parking space could be challenging on busy days.< /Text>< Pictures>

Food is great, I like to call it comfort food. Candied bacon is INCREDIBLE and a must have.

The menu is a little bit daunting and some items are too complex. I have had near everything on the menu. Some is outstanding and some is just good. Nothing has ever been bad.

The run punch takes me all the way back to Jamaica sitting at a swim up bar where being handed a coconut drink....< /review>

Love this place.  Really are nice about letting well behaved dogs on patio.  Love that there are rule you must abide by so snarky dogs get booted.  They are also cool when you are working hard to a climate and desensitize your dog to public places and will be cool as long as you are really working on it.  When we were there there was a couple with a young dog who got excited when other dogs approached but the owners were awesome at redirecting their dog and keeping it under control so the staff was cool.  Dogs and humans had a great time.  And there were lots of families with kids inside too to watch the Olympics<//review>

Lazy Dog is one of the best restaurants out there, hands down. They have super yummy vegan options and an amazing selection of drinks. Me and my brother always hit this up on our way home from LBC and it's so good every single time, highly recommend.</Text>

The food was not amazing, but it was good. However, the service was great. The manager even came by and introduced himself spontaneously. They were nice and personable with genuine smiles. I will definitely come back.< /Text>

Very good selection. I never saw so many people working at a restaurant before. It helps when it comes to fast service. Food prices are reasonable but drinks are a little high. not a great happy hour. I liked the general feel of the place, fun and friendly. Good music and my 20 mo. old does well there. She also likes the food. Would have gave it 5 stars if it wasn't for the happy hour and drink prices. Still rec-amend for family.< /Review>

<resp>None</resp><review>Whenever I come here I am little disappointed. The place has a lot of potential but so far it has remained just that.

The food here is just okay and I would say below average for the price and type of restaurant. Its a loud restaurant as well though if you sit outside it is quite nice. Overall I would say there are many better options in the surrounding areas however this place tends to have a smaller wait and will suffice for a normal night out with friends or family. Wouldn't come here for a special occasion.< /review>< rating>

I have been to Lazy Dog in different locations and typically visit only when it is suggested by a friend. I met a friend here for brunch on a Saturday morning around 10 am and found the restaurant to be relatively empty which was nice as we had our choice of seating outdoors. We were seated a table that had the sun directly on us. At first, it felt nice, but after while I started sweating and when our food was brought to us, I asked if we could move to a table that had more shade which there was plenty. The food runner let us know that we had to ask our server so we waited about 10 minutes before our server arrived and we were allowed to move tables.

My friend and I started off with a bloody mary that was delicious and strong. I loved the pickled green beans that came with it. As my brunch entree, I chose the breakfast burrito that had chorizo in it. It was covered in both green and red sauce which looked amazing. It was also stuffed with french fries. I found the chorizo to be bland and not very flavorful. I usually avoid ordering chorizo unless it is a mexican restaurant and this confirmed my suspicion. The sauces and fries were delicious, I just found something missing. The restaurant is in a big shopping center so there are no worries about parking here. Lazy Dog Restaurants are great restaurants for meeting with friends who may not have a particular craving as there is a ton of options you can choose from. I find this place to be a safe option among groups, but I have yet to have a dish that I crave and want to come back for. You can also head over to the Ontario Mills across the street to walk off your food coma.< /Text>

There is a wide variety of food choices here and the staff here is always very friendly. We have never had to wait very long. On warm days it's nice to sit in their patio area, especially if the inside is busier. The waitress has even offered us deals we weren't aware of such as promotions online we could access with our phone while we waited. I think the food could improve slightly as it is good but not my favorite. We will definitely return.<//text>

< Review>
Five of us had a long dinner, not because of the service (that was EXCELLENT) but because we talked so much and ordered a lot. The best part was at the end when we ordered an apple huckleberry pie and it was heavy on the apples and very light on the huckleberries. I teased the waitress that her tip would be based on how many huckleberries we found, and at the end, she came out with a little dish of huckleberries that she found on her search in the freezer! Cutest thing ever. I even gave her a hug upon departure. The food was very good, the atmosphere was great, getting to know our new friends in such a place was a wonderful, but our waitress was a pure delight. I wish I could remember her name. Nakeene or Nikaa or some unusual name. Two syllables I know.</Review>

The overall ambience is nice but a little bit noisy. This is one of the few restaurants in Rancho Cucamonga where pets are allowed on the patio. The food is very good as well. Especially Cajun Fries, Mac + Cheese, Fried Chicken Sandwich, Baja California Burger, Ginger Soy Salmon, Fettuccine Alfredo and Crispy Onion Rings are highly recommended. The customer service is appreciable. The staff is prompt, friendly and cooperative. The price is okay except the price of the small plates seems a bit high considering the amount. The restaurant usually gets crowded in the evening, so it would be better to confirm reservation before going there.</Text>< Resp>

<user_name>Jay N< /user_name><review>Surprisingly for being a franchise, the quality of this lazy dog is so great! Went here for a late night solo dinner, and ordered the bacon candy, large sticky ribs, and butter cake.

Bacon candy is a MUST GET! Eat it while it's hot! Large sticky ribs were really good and would also recommend, but the "umami fries" were just standard fries when I got them. Butter cake was highly recommended by staff, but it was actually the least satisfying of the 3 courses.

Atmosphere is fun, restaurant is spacious, and staff is so so friendly. Would definitely come back.< /review><UserId.>100151538572454149186</UserId.></record>

I've always had a positive experience here. I generally go during happy hour which is great! Happy hour selection ranges from $3-7.

Sweet potatoe tater tots & the nachos are tasty and sharable options.

Also, they're phenomenal with dogs. I take mine and they are always hospitable to me and my pets; without asking they bring out a bowl of fresh water for them. Plus, they offer a chicken bowl just for pets.

They patio area is large but cozy.

Food wise there is something for everyone. My favorite is the pot roast.< /text>

< Review>
Re-heated eggplant parmesan was so hard on the bottom that my friends rather expensive veneer, front tooth came completely out. We had to have the mgr re-write his report that originally stated that she bit into regular fresh parmesan. That kinda makes me upset he tried to do that. So I asked if we need an attorney? He went and re-wrote her statement properly. Not impressed at all on the way this was handled. She's crying while her tooth is in her hand not her mouth and he's falsely writing the report. A follow up review coming to see how further handled.< /Review>

In short; great atmosphere, great food, and great service.

My wife and I ate here for the first time last night on a date and I must say that I was extremely impressed.  The restaurant itself has inviting, yet rustic decor and an overall fun atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly and very helpful when it came to answering questions about menu items.

The restaurant was very busy during our visit, but our waitress was still very attentive.  She returned to our table after it had been a bit since we placed our order to assure us that the food would be out shortly.  We assured her we weren't worried about it and that we understood because of how busy the restaurant was.

When our food finally came it was delivered by a manager and he also apologized for the wait.  The food itself was delicious, the only real complaint we had was that they use a fairly soft tofu in their wok dishes, which typically feature a more firm tofu, but otherwise the food was really good.<//review>

<rate>3</rate><Text>I would have given this place a 4 or even a 5 star rating had it not been for seeing a waitress clean a spill off of the floor, stepping on the same cloth napkins that the customers are served on their table wrapped around their silverware.  Is that not what mops are for?  After a long discussion about immediately leaving, it was decided to give the place a try. The ahi tuna and buffalo meatloaf was delicious and the service was pretty good considering how busy it was.  We tried to discuss the cleaning issue with management before we left but they we not available.   Beside the initial shock of lack of employee training we enjoyed our time here.  I would hope the management would properly train their employees how to properly handle cleaning especially not using the same cloth napkins we use to eat with as a foot mop on the floor.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>I had the Black + Blue Pizza and it was delicious! Though the pizza was large to eat for one person. The waitress was amazing and very kind. Good place to go!< /review>< Pictures>

The patio is dog friendly and there is open seating available. Water is complimentary for your dog, they offer brown rice with your choice of grilled chicken or a hamburger patty on their doggy menu. The menu itself is extensive offering fusion cuisine that includes Asian, Latin, flat breads, pastas and American. Staff is friendly and attentive. It is popular for dinner Thursday thru Sunday.< /Text>

Like all other Lazy Dogs, but chain does a lot quite well. This particular experience was good...good service, fun ambience, very decent food for a large chain. Cocktails used fresh ingredients and not pre made mixers.</Review>

This late night dining sipping establishment is far above what I expected. Variety, huge portion sizes, great ambiance and excellent customer service from the front door to the table service. Most importantly the food is delicious. Five star comfortable.<//text>

I always have a good time here. I prefer to sit outside as I enjoy the atmosphere. They have good craft brews on taps and delicious appetizers and entrees. It's a bit pricey at times though but well worth it.< /Text>

Flemings is a fantastic restaurant, and dinner is worth every penny. But this review is about their happy hour. People line up at 4:15PM to get in on happy hour when they open at 5. They have a 5 for 6 until 7 happy hour menu that is fantastic.<//text>

There is so much room here, so barely any wait. And I love seeing the dogs all around. Food has been delicious. I love the small plate options because you can either get one small thing or try two different thing you want, but not spend a ton.<//Text>

<Text>This is a strong choice if you're looking for a restaurant with traditional favorites on the menu, like the steak or burgers and also a seasonal menu. The grilled artichokes are an excellent choice to start the meal. I like the lemon chicken (only 800 calories if it mattrrs to you) from the seasonal menu or the Ginger soy salmon. Both are delicious. If you feel like meat, the sticky ribs with fries are great. Hardly a bad thing on the menu!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Flemings is a fantastic restaurant, and dinner is worth every penny. But this review is about their happy hour. People line up at 4:15PM to get in on happy hour when they open at 5. They have a 5 for 6 until 7 happy hour menu that is fantastic.</text>

In short; great atmosphere, great food, and great service.

My wife and I ate here for the first time last night on a date and I must say that I was extremely impressed.  The restaurant itself has inviting, yet rustic decor and an overall fun atmosphere.  Our waitress was very friendly and very helpful when it came to answering questions about menu items.

The restaurant was very busy during our visit, but our waitress was still very attentive.  She returned to our table after it had been a bit since we placed our order to assure us that the food would be out shortly.  We assured her we weren't worried about it and that we understood because of how busy the restaurant was.

When our food finally came it was delivered by a manager and he also apologized for the wait.  The food itself was delicious, the only real complaint we had was that they use a fairly soft tofu in their wok dishes, which typically feature a more firm tofu, but otherwise the food was really good.< /Review>

We came to Lazy Dog on a Saturday night...we had tried walking-in to a  couple restaurants prior to Lazy Dog but they had a ridiculously long wait...we called Lazy Dog and then asked for their wait time and they said they didn't have one at the moment but it could change. After calling we got there within 10 minutes and waited MAYBE 10-20 at most to be seated...let me add that we were a group of 11. From the moment we walked in the door to the time we left (after closing), the service was great. We didn't feel rushed...AND I have to give major KUDOS and THANK YOU's to Ronda our server! She was great...she answered all our questions, she made suggestions, she had a great attitude. She helped my family surprise me with a cake! I'm very happy those other places we tried had a long wait time because Lazy Dog was definitely worth it. It was our first time there and thanks to Ronda, we will definitely come back!<//Review>

<text>This place was wonderful. I didnt have any clue about this restaurant but we had a large group and someone else chose it.... NOT DISAPPOINTED! We ordered a bunch of different options and EVERYONE was happy with their selection. I even ordered a slightly complicated drink and our server and the bartender took GREAT care of me! And I wish I remembered our server's name because his customer service was OUTSTANDING...  highly recommend this place!<//text>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><text>This is by far one of my favorite local restaurants. The meals are consistently good and I dig the open air mall (Victoria Gardens) location. Have I had a better steak, of course. But not by far and not a better price point. The bartenders rock and all know my preferred drink.< /text>< pictures>

Great vibe, big open space, quality service. I personally like the Hummus Trio as an appetizer, and the Thai Noodles for entree. They brew their own beers and they're all good. You can't go wrong at the Lazy Dog basically</Text>

Nice local restaurant with a wide ranging menu. The service was fast and friendly. The salads are my favorites but we've never had a bad meal here. On a pretty day the outside seating is wonderful.< /Text>

<Text>We have been to Lazy Dog many times and almost always have great service.   This last time,  our server was excellent!   The food is extremely varied and yummy.   The happy hour food and drinks are a great deal (before 6 and after 9) and it's nice to sit around the outdoor firepit while enjoying them!
I'm a vegetarian and I find plenty of things to eat there,  but my favorite is their house-made hummus.  I know,  I know,  why would you order hummus when you go out to eat?   Well,  it is bomb!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c33580dd3c8201:0x658f66bcc2c1a8e0< /gmap_id></record>

The food is surprisingly good. I always take these chain sit down restaurant's potential quality with a grain of salt but the food at this place is definetly well thought out and prepared. Large beer selection. The plus if you're a dog owner, you can bring you dog to eat with you.<//Review>

we haven't been to LD in a while...mostly tired of their food selection even though it's a large selection. Apparently they've updated their menu and we met for dinner and drinks. The Bar is the same, good selection and mixers are great. This time I opted for the Buffalo Fried Cauliflower and let me tell you, that was really really delicious. The only change I'd make is make it a larger serving. Service was ok, server got it my friend order wrong and they had to make the right thing for him while everyone had their food already so that was a drag. I'm sure we will be back.< /Review>

I would recommend their scrambled eggs with cheese and French toast with avocado. I am not crazy for French toast, but what they served was toasted French bread with a delicious avocado topping. Yummy!!</Review>

Food was good. Had Chilaquiles for brunch. It was tasty.

The dogs loved their food (big surprise!).

Only issue... how does a dog oriented place not have disposal near the door. I had to walk across the parking lot to dispose of the babies business.</Review>

If you enjoy bringing your actual pet dog to a restaurant, this is the place for you. The outdoor area is very comfortable with cozy furniture and even a fire pit which is lit at night. The food is generally just ok, but their half pound burgers are very satisfying.<//text>

What can I say, I love Lazy Dog! It's an excellent place to hangout with friends after work or weekend. Very relaxing place with full of energetic staffs. Drinks and food are tasty! You can even bring your dog to their outside seating area. Oh, and they serve dog food as well!

Tip: check in with Yelp app to receive a free order of cajun fries.<//review>

Food was excellent as always!   The best part was that they are dog freindly on their patio.   I was celebrating my dog's birthday and she loved her chicken dinner as much as I enjoyed my dinner.</Review>

No very happy after waiting for 1:45 for our meals.  We had two wrong plates sent to our table, and after waiting for so much I never had our server ever come back to see if we wanted any refills.  To top it off, I was over charge twice.  After spending $150 and the kind of service I received I will never go back there.< /review>

I would recommend their scrambled eggs with cheese and French toast with avocado. I am not crazy for French toast, but what they served was toasted French bread with a delicious avocado topping. Yummy!!</review>

Food was excellent as always!   The best part was that they are dog freindly on their patio.   I was celebrating my dog's birthday and she loved her chicken dinner as much as I enjoyed my dinner.<//Review>

Great lunch today. Staff was extremely friendly, complimented the pet that associate had brought. Manager came out and spoke with us. Offered a complimentary sample. Perfect for dog owners to bring their pets. I don't own a dog but will return. Food was excellemt<//review>

Food is really good. I ate half my bf’s black & blue burger & the salsa verde nachos are amazing! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I didn’t like that though but that’s only because I am extremely weird about coleslaw but my bf liked it a lot so I don’t blame the business, I blame myself xD lol but the waitress was very attentive. The menu had such great variety & choices of things you can’t get else where. I will be going back because I saw some drinks & desserts I still need to try!< /review>

<Text>Received a small gift from one of the managers because it was my first visit. Nice welcome gesture. Absolutely loved the place! Excellent protein style burger cooked unsalted as requested, classic yet trendy atmosphere, lots of people there but still plenty of room. We're from Coachella Valley, about an hour drive, but we'll be back. It's worthy to be considered a destination. Have a dog? Bring it on the patio.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I came here to eat and grab a beer. I dealt with the general manager Brian and he was extremely professional and checked up on me several times to make sure I was a happy customer. Because of the expierence I had with Brian and the awesome food, I will be back again. First time visitor here.</review>

I went here once and the food was soooo good. I went this time at none of the four of our plates were good. I was disappointed in the flavor of the food. They also had us wait a long time to be served our food.<//Text>

<Text>Food quality was fantastic and our server actively assisted us (bringing off-menu treats at the perfect time when we we're struggling with our two year old. THAT act alone kept us from leaving without ordering because our child wasn't cooperating. We we're able to enjoy a meal we didn't have to cook or clean up in a fun, relaxed atmosphere.

I dont usually have favorites but this place is hands down my favorite restaurant. The food is so different from so many places. I love the freshness in the menu. The seasonal menu is my go to. Asparagus soup!? And the mac n cheese is to die for. I never really try desserts but i shared one with my friends and i have no regrets. The lemon cake with huckleberry sauce AND its gluten free? If everything gluten free tasted that good id convert. They make freah and healthy so desirable. Though it isnt really healthy its honestyle with a new age twist. AND I CAN BRING MY DOG! there is no way this place can go wrong.</Text>

No very happy after waiting for 1:45 for our meals.  We had two wrong plates sent to our table, and after waiting for so much I never had our server ever come back to see if we wanted any refills.  To top it off, I was over charge twice.  After spending $150 and the kind of service I received I will never go back there.<//Text>

We, married double date, first came for drinks about a month ago later in the evening, delish! We each tried four different drinks, everything was tasty. The bacon in the old fashion was sooo amazing, and the service was great. So today, the same we, came for an early Sunday dinner to try the food. This time I ordered the bacon candy as a shared starter, YUM. The food was great and the service was amazing and friendly. Great job Lazy Dog staff! We will definitely be coming back!<//Review>

<Review>Stopped by here the night before a flight out of Ontario Airport. Every place else was packed with a very long and slow wait. This place was busy but they moved the waiting list along fairly quickly and efficiently. The wife loved the Westside Manhanttans and her Asian Sticky Ribs. My Alfredo & Chicken was pretty good overall. If you are a first timer, they will bring you their garlic waffle chips to try. Be warned, there is A LOT of garlic. The restaurant is located in a strip mall area along busy 4th Street and there is ample off-street parking. I would recommend this place for some decent food and drinks when you are in the area.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>A fun little restaraunt that caters to those who enjoy bringing their canine pals to eat with them. The staff is very patient with your canine pals and should be commended for this. The food is kind of mediocre but not bad.< /Text>< resp>

Great food. They keep changing the menu and a few of my favorites have left. Plus the music was so loud I had trouble hearing people at my table. Hope they bring back the bacon and broccoli appetizer. Like this place a lot. Let's see you make a Belgium style ale too.<//Review>

I LOVE this place! From the super cool fireplace outside, to the friendly servers & staff, I can't begin to explain how much I enjoy coming here. Don't forget the incredible HAPPY HOUR specials and prices that are just to die for. Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself 😉</Review>

I have a love hate relationship with this place. My favorite salad is gone and my favorite appetizer of poke was replaced with a cup of cucumber and like 3 pieces of tuna. Their fish and chips hit the spot however and most of their food is still worth going for.<//Text>

My brown rice was sparce, mixed vegetables was lacking every kind of seasoning, and the tiny piece of salmon was just oKay. So disappointed because I frequently go there and dine in and the food is usually good. I'll blame it on them being busy and understaffed- I will go there again. Hoping they won't disappoint.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE,  OUR WAITRESS WAS FRIENDLY AND COURTEOUS! ATMOSPHERE WAS EXCELLENT. SOME MAY FIND IT A LITTLE LOUD. BUT DECORATIONS AND INTERIOR DESIGN WAS GREAT. WE HAD A WAITRESS WHO'S NAME WAS KRISSY. SHE REMEMBERED EVERYONE'S ORDER EXACTLY WITHOUT WRITING ANYTHING DOWN.  I EVEN TOLD THE MANAGER HOW GREAT EVERYTHING WAS INCLUDING THE SERVICE. I'M FROM TEXAS AND MY COWORKER FROM LOUISIANA. I WILL BE BACK AGAIN.</text>

Odd name. Late night happy hour was plus. The salad, sprouts, and house beer was not. Menu is a bit all over the place, so don't expect excellence in any one thing.<//text>

Everything we ordered was awesome, the side salad was the best salad ever especially the red peppers on it.
The Cole slaw is great being a Cole slaw critic.
The blackened chicken bowl was so good cuz of the spice taste, and beer battered fish was great and the fries too.
Last but served first was the best watermelon margarita on the rocks, I couldn't get it down fast enough lol.<//Review>

Wow! Exceeded our expectations. Great tasting food, had chicken pot pie and chicken poblano (mildly spicy) and 2 menu options for smaller and bigger kids (under 12). Enjoy! You must.</review>

<Review>Unique and delicious menu. Friendly staff and when they accidentally dropped my dogs food on the floor they remade it for her. I insisted my dog eats stuff of the floor anyways but they remade it and comped her food. Above and beyond customer service.< /Review><Time>1498578128462</Time><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Love their drinks, food, and the fact you can bring your four legged family member.  They even have a special menu for your dog!  How cute is that?  The service us very good and quality of the food is very good.  Great as a dinner sent tête à tête or as a group.<//review>

I got there at 4:30 had 3 servers, but little service. They didn't take our order until almost six didn't get our food until 6:30 and was basically ignored. We were on the patio because of my pup but I saw a few tables who were seated after me leave and even had the manager come out to talk to them. I'm leaving not happy and it will be a while before I come back here again.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Friendly staff, food is out in no time and tons of cute dogs to gawk at. This place can be a little busy so if you have a large party be sure to arrive early. The bar can be busy too, so be prompt before there is no space available.</Text>

< Review>
Dinner was delicious. I had the pot roast and our table tried the rosemary herb chicken and the sticky ribs.
The in house beer variety was also wide. IPAs to Stouts to Reds and even Hefeweizen.
We'll have to return tomorrow and a different dish.</Review>

<Review>What can we say other than this place is awesome.  Dog friendly.  Fun fire pit to sit around enjoying a cocktail and food while meeting new people.  Hang out in the var area to watch a game and get private with a table in tge restaurant.  We are night owls so the fact happy hour is served at 9pm to Midnight is awesome.  Our servers have been great.  All who've provided very good service. We also like that they really encourage you to e explore their menu. If you don't like the dish, they have no problem taking it back to the kitchen and getting something you do (because youre getting out of your comfort area and trying something new).  Their menu features are great with seasonal items.  If your looking for an awesome bacon wrapped hot dog (only place we can find one at a restaurant), with coleslaw and potato chips on top,  youve got to try their happy hour!   Flatbed crisps, halibut, pot pie, fried chicken, salads, burgers, sandwiches, apps and small bites are so good!!!!  If you haven't yet, go to lazy dogs.< /Review>< response>

<Text>Friendly staff, food is out in no time and tons of cute dogs to gawk at. This place can be a little busy so if you have a large party be sure to arrive early. The bar can be busy too, so be prompt before there is no space available.< /Text>< Pics>

I actually really enjoy the brunch menu here. The chilaquiles and the sunny side up pizza are wonderful and great to share.  I also love the fact that you can bring your dog to the patio of the restaurant.<//Review>

It was between Lazy Dog and Fuddruckers.   Our waitress, Rhonda, was the best. They didn't have the beer that I had ordered, so she brought me back a sample of something else. The restaurant is nice inside and the patio is really cool with a fire pit. I got the BBQ ranch burger and my wife got the turkey on focaccia bread. Both were really good. My burger may have been the best tasting burger that I've ever had. We went to Fuddruckers the next day and we we're so disappointed. We wished we had just gone back to lazy dog. They are right accross the street from each other, almost the same price, but not even close in quality.< /Text>

Love the new look and feel and taste of this place!
My fiancé got a specialty drink that was delicious and I got a citrus soda that was sweet and tasty. The fruit was very fresh. We both got appetizers, main courses, and dessert because everything just sounded so good. Everything was plated and presented well, and the taste was divine. My halibut was excellently prepared, and my fiancé's pork shank was cooked to perfection. Definitely recommend taking advantage of their seasonal menu! The huckleberry and apple open faced pie a la mode and s'more desserts were also heavenly.
The service was pleasant and responsive, if a bit slow. It's worth noting we went at peak hours on a Saturday night and still we're seated within 10 minutes of arriving, so it was definitely not a major problem. We were honestly expecting slower.
Lazy Dog provides a gourmet dining experience for an affordable price. With 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 specialty seasonal main courses, and 2 desserts, the bill was still under $100. The atmosphere is comfortable and casual, while nice enough to be romantic.
Overall, I was thrilled with our experience at Lazy Dog and am excited to eat there again soon.<//Text>

Minus one star for being a chain but if you are in the mood for noisey sports bar meets claim jumper meets elephant bar then you are in for a treat..  I had ahi dinner - just a little on the fishy side, and wife had portabello burger - yum. My teen son actually only ate half of his burger - said he was full.  The house beer sampler is good.< /Review>

The only good thing that they have going for them is that they allow dogs and there is a Dog menu. However if you order the wrong human food, from the menu, you will mistaken it for dog food.

Haven't been to lazy dog in a while. Decided to come for my mom's birthday and a Sunday. It was pretty busy but surprisingly the wait wasn't long at all. Not even 10 minutes. The menu is different but still has alot of the same food on it. We tried brunch and it was delicious. I tried the breakfast club and I was very happy with my meal. I also had a mango chile margarita. Definitely get that if you love mango and tajin like I do.<//Text>

<pics>None< /pics><text>The food here is alright, if not a bit bland.  The pizza i had was a far too saucy, especially considering that I asked for mine to have minimum sauce.
The french dip is a far better experience. It was tinder meat that almost melted in my mouth. The onion is not for the faint of heart sadly, as it was overwhelming at times, so eat at your own risk.
The atmosphere and service is outstanding however. In my 5 times of visiting, the wait staff has always been very kind, and very attentive.  The place has been full, however it never feel crowded.
I must say it was hard to review such a place, as it is truely a split place. It can be an excellent place for a romantic bite to eat, or a loud and only acceptable eatery.  I would go with the former over the later in my discriptions of lazy dog, if only because the staff is so good.
Heres hoping for the best for you looking to come by.
Good luck!<//text>< Gmap_id>

Walked on over from the Petro Truckstop across the 10 . A light rain fell as I entered the Lazy Dog for a relaxing afternoon.  The bartender was very cheerful and the Modelo cold . Then the Thai Chicken salad arrived ...WOW !! Mission accomplished and Sara went above and beyond to make sure my cup runneth almost over  !!</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>It was my first time going to Lazy Dog and lucky us it was happy hour. The menu was unique and we ordered plenty of appetizers and a $15 pitcher of white moscato sangria. For first timers, the waffle cut parmesan fries was on the house for giving Lazy Dog a try! Who doesn't appreciate free appetizers?! Great service amd very attentive.< /text>< pics>

One cool thing is if you own a dog you can bring them and dine out side with them.. the dogs arent aloud to dine inside at all.. unless its A.D.A .</Text>< Rate>

Really was please. With food. CAJUN FRIES appetizer was Amazing with chipotle ranch. We sat outaide since it was a nice day.... never done that beforw so quite surprised with all the dogs on the patio but they didnt seem to bother anyone and they gave you clear warning if you didnt wanna deal with dogs sit inside. Have been before food and drinks are good< /Review>

<Review>Came in for a 4th of July lunch and I felt rushed to pick an entree. So I just went with what the waitress suggested which was the Calamari, and it sucked. Luckily my boyfriend was kind enough to trade entrees with me. The Carne Asade plate was pretty good.< /Review><user>108550795847305845775</user><Time>1372966574775</Time><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

This was our first time out at a restaurant since the pandemic started and we stopped by for brunch because we were in the area. I had the breakfast burrito but was not fond of the "salsa" it honestly tasted like spaghetti sauce. And the donut holes we ordered were a little burnt. I've had lazy dog dinner before the pandemic and it was great but I definitely wouldn't go back for brunch.< /Text>
