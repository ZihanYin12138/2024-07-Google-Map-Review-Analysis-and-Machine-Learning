Joe and his team did a large plumbing job, replacing old cast iron pipes with all new drains as well as installing a laundry hookup. They did a great job! They showed up on time and were respectful and even finished the work ahead of schedule. All this for a very competitive price. I will be using them again in the future!<//Text>

Joe (the owner) and Jesse were friendly,  professional, and courteous. I appreciated that they both wore masks (due to covid) and used shoe covers. They took care to keep the shower clean as they worked. Additionally, Joe took the time to answer all of our questions. I’d definitely call them again for future plumbing issues.<//Review>

Our old water heater was leaking and caused a bit of water damage in our garage. Joe was able to come and see what was going on and referred us to get the damage fixed and install the water heater.

Fast forward a couple weeks, where the construction company was fixing the dry wall and took it upon themselves to place the water heater. They ended up doing it wrong and we have no hot water for THREE days.

Joe stopped by to pick up the old water heater and looked at the job they did and was concerned because it was wrong (Joe was suppose to install it but the construction company for some reason did it). He took it upon himself to make sure that he fixed this ASAP. He made calls got us a completely new water heater and installed it himself in LESS than 20 hours. He was determined about getting this fixed for us because he know we had no hot water.

Joe and his team came in, did their magic and I went to wash dishes and burned my hand with hot water. I have never been so happy!

It was so nice to know he really cared, wanted to fix the situation and followed through with everything he said. If I have any future plumbing issues I am 100% going to call them. I could not be more happy with their promptness, professionalism, and knowledge.</text>

<review>I was referred to Above and Beyond by a friend who had a major sewer repair.
I was experiencing some similar issues,  so I gave them a chance.
They came by to inspect and let me know that we did have a problem but didn’t need the major repairs like my friend!
They gave me options for what was needed I really appreciated their honestly from the get-go
We approved the estimate and I’m sure we made the correct decision< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The removal and installation of water heater was done expertly, in short time and with best quality work. Joe noticed our out of shape water pipes which he replaced also.  He also saw our main sewage pipes leaking and in their worst shape.  For sure, his  proactiveness saved us from a future, expensive emergency repalrs.

Overall, we are happy with Above and Beyond who truly lives up to their company name. This company completed all jobs exceptionally well and went ABOVE and BEYOND our expectations.

We've used Above & Beyond plumbing a few times now. This time it was for a sink & shower drain clean out. They are always on-time, friendly, professional & do a great job. We received a quote before the work was started so we knew what we were dealing with. Quick & efficient! We will always use them for any plumbing services we need.</text>

< review>
i was "looking for an HONEST, RELIABLE and AFFORDABLE plumber in San Diego" who "BELIEVES in DOing the job RIGHT the FIRST time" so that i "never have to worry about the QUALITY of the work" received. After going through YELP's reviews and reading ABOVE & BEYOND's website -- i thought i was on the right track of finding that HONEST, RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE plumber.

JOE GARCIA proved that he TRULY lives by his NAME and what's advertized on the website. His family-owned company and team of workers (i met Juan, David, and Viviana by phone) not only met my expectations -- expert workmanship, detailed professionalism, respectful courtesy -- they went ABOVE and BEYOND. Joe gave NO bait-n-switch, just UP-FRONT rates for our three plumbing issues -- even told us how to save money by buying the faucets ourselves. Joe gave us a $50-DISCOUNT for the inconvenience of changing our scheduled appointment due to an emergency. He put in practice the "ABOVE and BEYOND" by coming to work on SUNDAY -- which was Mother's Day! (But no worries -- May 10 is the Mexican "Dia de las Madres" which the family will celebrate today, Monday.) Joe finished the other faucet Monday morning, when he came with David even before 8am sharp. The "ABOVE and BEYOND" was again proven when Joe, via David, changed some really old corroded pipe-parts at NO EXTRA CHARGE. JOE GARCIA and company has "TURNED this ONE-TIME client into his LIFELONG customer!"<//review>

The contractor for HD kinda left me in a lurch of no reply to my email or voice message.  I heard back from four local companies.

Above and Beyond not only were the first to reply, they were first on the scene with Jose G coming out to do an inspection and estimate in 30 minutes after the initial contact.

Joe G explained everything to me ( I knew my place was out of the newer code) of what had to happen to my satisfaction.  He even made me aware of  a discount coupon that I hadn't seen.  We agreed upon the work order and schedule.

The next day, Joe arrived with a co-worker and they removed the old heater, installed the new heater. All the while, they were respectful of the property and the neighbors ( Condo).

All in all, I am very pleased with my decision to go with Joe and Above and Beyond.  I highly recommend!<//Review><name>J. Shinobi</name></record></dataset><record>

We called to have someone check out multiple issues we needed: our gas line to the stove recessed, a refrigerator hose in a new area, a garage sink install and laundry p-trap fix. They were prompt, Covid safe, and the next day we had a fair price. We were flexible with our schedule so we said whenever they had the time and less than a week later it is done! They are very clean, great at communicating any possible issues that all construction work can have, not pushing “up sells” and won’t take a payment unless you like the work. We are very pleased. As we remodel our kitchen we are calling them back.<//Text>

Above and beyond drains and plumbing really live up to their name. They are very professional. I was in need of a plumber but was skeptical of hiring anyone due to the pandemic. But they reassured our family that they would take precautions to protect everyone and they truly do. They did a quick and clean job. I truly appreciate them and if I ever need a plumber in the future I will be contacting them again.
Thank you Above and Beyond.</review>

Joe and his team were amazing. We had issues with the bathroom backing up, Above and Beyond came to the rescue. We ended up having them replace all of our old inky pipes with brand new ones.

<review>Had a stubborn clogged bathtub, I tried all the home DIY that I could find. Nothing seemed to work. Turned out that the problem was bigger than just a clogged-up drain.
They explained the problem and provide options for the repairs.
We approved the work and they got straight to work that same day.

<Review>After hiring several plumbers through the years, I finally found the ONE!  In hiring this company, I learned that there is honesty and integrity behind all they do. No nickle and diming just straightforward job needed and flat, reasonable price. I’m truly happy with work done and price paid.</Review>< Name>

We recently bought an older home and plumbing was one of the first things we did to get it inspected since it’s cast iron pipes.  We reached out to multiple plumbing companies and it wasn’t until we met Joe that we knew we wanted to go with them. It’s hard to find a company where you know they aren’t just trying to take your money and add on extra charges and fees. Joe and his crew were very professional and very honest people. They were super friendly and literally went above and beyond. They epoxylined our pipes and also fixed our kitchen line. They found a crack that our first inspectors never saw. I would recommend them to anyone as well as have them come back for any maintenance as needed.<//text>

Contacted this company late in the afternoon when I couldn't find any other company available.
They schedule me right away for same day service!
The technician was very knowledgeable and didn't mind to explain his findings.
He provided me with a free estimate and as soon as I approve he got straight to work .
They really do go Above and Beyond for they customers !< /text>

<review>Above and Beyond Drains & Plumbing came to our house within 20 minutes that we called for a repair. Joe was professional and easily explained the Problem. He was even quicker to fix the problem. There was no inspection fee. Just got charged for the job that came with a warranty. The lady on the phone was just as professional.  I highly recommend this local company.< /review>< userid>

Joe and Viviana at Above and Beyond Drains & Plumbing made the process extremely pleasant. Joe was so professional and knowledgeable, and he was upfront and explained exactly what he was going to do beforehand. Showed up on time, completed the job, and explained what he completed. He even gave the previous plumbing technician the benefit of the doubt since that technician wasn't able to clear our blockage- great display of professionalism. I would definitely call Joe and Viviana again in the future. I should add that we used a home warranty insurance company's preferred plumber for the previous job that wasn't complete. I would choose Above and Beyond Drains & Plumbing over them and gladly pay out of pocket for this company's service.< /Text>

<review>Over as well as Beyond did specifically that. We had a leak in our container hot water heater around 8pm during the night. While discussing yelp, they requested specific typical signs of dripping factors on the container. After describing to them and also taking images, they came by the following early morning early. They did not bill for a consultation like some other business, and also were detailed. Their pricing was very affordable, and also we wound up getting a tankless hot water heater installed the next day. They fully cleaned up after themselves, and also took the old storage tank heating unit with them leaving us with absolutely nothing except satisfied customers. Their manager came by a couple of days later on to examine the task, in addition to show us exactly how to do the yearly flushing of the system so we wouldn't need to pay the $175 a year for the upkeep. In general, an awesome experience and I will definitely recommend them to family and friends, in addition to use them again for anything later on. 5 * s completely.</review>< Pictures>

The plumber came to my apartment to fix a stuck drain plug. Immediately he saw how bad the recent Appliance was under the sink and replaced the old Parts with new and had no problem free movie plug. Gave me an easy-to-understand briefing on what was done before and what he fixed. I was very happy but it wasn't as big of an issue that's all right thought it was. No pipes had to be removed.</Review>

Joe was detailed, professional and respectful in explaining to my 97 year old mother the process of hydro jetting..He and his assistant completed hydro jet process without any issue. However, when they used the snake in the bathroom plumbing, they encountered an issue that caused a small leak. He and his assistant worked laboriously without concern of their time as long as it get fix. So they fixed it with no extra cost!!! Truly, these guys are troopers!!!!Bless his heart, my mother was happy with the discount.</review>

OMG, STAY AWAY from these guys!!  Jose "Joe" Garcia is a very unprofessional and unscrupulous person.  I received their bill and they charged me over $20,000 to make a repair at my home.  What?!?!  Are You Kidding Me ?!   I thought it was a mistake.  I contacted a different plumber and they provided a quote for half the price for the same work!

It seems that Jose "Joe" Garcia was charging me "above and beyond" what is fair and reasonable.  What a disgrace to the profession. He is not a plumber, he is a rip-off artist!

When I asked for justification of his cost, he produced an accounting for labor that did not match. For example, he claimed that teams of individuals were at my property making repairs on a daily basis.  But in reality, when I checked and documented the daily progress, I discovered that no workers were ever present on the claimed days. He lied about the labor hours worked in order to justify his outrageous invoice.

My biggest regret was hiring them. I only wish that I could erase this whole episode from my memory and forget that "Above and Beyond Plumbing" ever existed!<//review>

Above and Beyond Plumbing are outstanding. I was alerted by text message when our plumber was in route to our house and the name of the plumber. Which is a great system. This way you know exactly who you will be dealing when they show up at your door. Jose was very professional and did an excellent job. We will most definitely be using Above and Beyond Plumbing again.< /Text>

The crew, led by Ben Gonzales were prompt, courteous and respectful.  They communicated equally well in English or Spanish.  They finished the job in half the time estimated, performed some extra work not contracted for at no extra cost.  If you need to replace your aging sewer line, there is no better company than this.< /text>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Had a severely grease clogged kitchen drain that no matter how much I snaked it, would not clear.  Jose G. from Above and Beyond plumbing went the extra mile to ensure the drain was clear and the water was no longer backing up.  Highly recommend Above and Beyond Plumbing.  Excellent customer service, excellent work.</review>< pictures>

After getting quotes from 3 various other firms for a tankless warm water heating unit, I so desired to offer these folks 5 star. Their team as well as quote were educated and also very competitive. Their installment job was additionally exceptional. In spite of ensuring me that they would certainly draw the permit for the job (as well as that they 'd done so prior to) and take treatment of the succeeding city evaluation, they backed out after the contract was signed. According to them, the needs for my neighborhood consisted of an entire site strategy for the complicated rather than my just my townhouse - making it cost-prohibitive. They refunded the permit cost, but not the examination visit fee even with numerous call. They did make a follow-up visit to confirm the performance of my unit and their prices consisted of a two-year labor guarantee and a flush of the unit after the initial year. PERK SUGGESTIONS: 1) Tankless water heaters warmth water instantaneously, however do NOT provide instantaneous warm water (pipeline size in between heater and also faucet is still the exact same). 2) They are very gas efficient, but not cheaper to operate provided their 2-3x installation cost and also anticipated useful life. 3) They are a lot more conscious hard water than storage water heaters. If you do not install an inline filter\/softener (at more cost), they will die early and also cost you much more than regular water heater. 4) You TIN retrofit a Noritz EZ design tankless right into an older condo\/home that has a 3-4\" exhaust and a 3\/4\" gas line. 5) These are offered as packages by Residence Depot, Lowes, and so on so make your installer price match considering that they mark that number up by 20%.</text>

<review>I had a leak in my garage and turned out my washer had flooded the whole garage, i called above and beyond drains and plumbing at night and they were at my door in no time ! Aurelio was awesome, he helped me and also explained exactly what the problem was and of course I had no clue when it comes to plumbing. It’s always good when you have people still wanting to actually give you time to explain things instead of just doing their job, and taking your money. I will most most definitely be calling them again. Very honest and clean work ! My hats off to them I recommend them to anyone and everyone looking for someone other than those big money digging companies.<//review><Name>Aleena Campos</Name></record></dataset><record>

We are very happy with the service we received.  This is the second time we have used Above and Beyond.  We first used them based on the great reviews we read online.  We initially used them install a new toilet.  This time we had a main sewer line clog.
Mariana took our call and was able to schedule a service call for the same day.  She was very pleasant and helpful.  Once our appointment was scheduled we were updated with an email confirming our appointment and also via text.  We were constantly updated via text about who was going to come to our house and what time the service man would arrive.
Miguel came to our house and was great.  He is smart and explained everything clearly.  Our main sewer line in our home was clogged.  After the clog was cleared, Miguel used the camera and showed me the tree roots that were causing the problem.  Joe came to the job site and brought an HD camera which gave us a better view of our problem.  Miguel used the water-jetting equipment to resolve the tree root issue.  We are very happy with the service we received. We will gladly use them again if needed.<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>This is the third time we have used this company and every time has been great. Jose Godinez helped me today with a dishwasher that was not draining; he immediately troubleshot the issue and isolated it to a build up of gunk, in the intake to the garbage disposal.  I'm not knowledgeable about plumbing, so he could have told me it was a huge job, and I would have believed him.  Instead he fixed the issue in under an hour and the service charge was reasonable.  As an added plus he was pleasant and polite, which was no surprise since that's been our experience with the plumbers in this company.<//review>< Pictures>

We called Joe Garcia with Above and Beyond Drains and Pluming when a previous plumber left us with a leak on a Friday night. Despite the after hours request, he came in a timely manner. He was so friendly and fixed our pipe within 15 minutes of walking in the door. He will be our go to plumber for all future issues. Thank you again for saving us a weekend full of leaks.</text>

SDG&E closed my gas meter due to a leak .
I was like crazy looking for plumbers that could give me a good price but as well explain what was going on and what it would take to repair.
I had one company come by that for starters arrive late and gave me very little information of the problem, they just threw a number at me.
I decided to give another company the opportunity to give me an estimate   This company charged me double of what the first company was charging me not only that but the estimator had horrible customer service.
My wife and I decided to look for a third company to give us an estimate as we were not satisfied with the last two .
The service was excellent from the moment we schedule the call .
The technician was here 15 minutes prior to the schedule time and he  took the time to check the line and explain with detail the problem and what he had to do in order to repair the leak, not to mentioned the price was lower than the other two companies .
Without thinking about it twice we decided to go with Above and Beyond Drains & Plumbing .
Now that the job is all complete I am sure we made the right decision .
A city inspector came by and even congratulate the company for the well and clean job completed .
I would definitely recommend Above and Beyond .< /Text>

They responded quickly, kept in close communication up to the appointment time and resolved the issue before anyone arrived.  Joe was awesome, price very reasonable -especially for a holiday weekend!  Above and Beyond does what their name implies...they go Above and Beyond!!

<Review>Not sure if this is for the entire complex or just martinis on 4th. Either way, I had a great time at martinis on 4th. The drinks there are pricey but well worth the money as they are built strong and tasty.

I sat on the partially enclosed patio and luckily no one was there smoking. I hate it when bars allow smoking then close it in with vinyl curtains. At that point you might as well allow it indoors. At least there is central ventilation that makes it more bareable.

Either way, I'll be back as they have a great spirit line up.<//Review>< Pictures>

Usually had good experience but this is the second time that I have made an appointment and when I show up they tell me it was at a different time.  My kids is young and won't stand around for someone to be available reason for the appointment. This is not professional.< /review>

<review>The woman we go to here has so much patience with my 1 year old. The prices are a little steep but worth every penny because of the patience and attention that is given to my son!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPI7c7Ne0Q7h7LyBs2fbaVUZn0TJicAJPJyJVM6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOo_KS-btHPS_0VCzZq7uT4kEcByu-r9k7AdjTh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c3280b9e373c7d:0x24edd3a17a90d1bc</gmapID></record>

<text>My son loves this place, he is 8, but there are kids of all ages here.  The stylists are friendly, unlike some of these other places where you could just tell, they are tired of kids, and their shenanigans. The prices are pretty standard for kids cuts, and overall I'm satisfied with the service.  We will be back for sure.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Our first time experience with our one year-old was better than I expected. He cried but Khin is well experienced and did a wonderful job. The different type of cars and the movie kept him (somewhat) entertained. Khin is quick and friendly.</text>< pictures>

<review>Staff is very friendly. Been bringing my 2 sons for the past year and they love coming here. Usually seen within a reasonable time but when its busy its worth the wait. They do a very good job and pricing is okay. My youngest son is not too cooperative and I'm just grateful that they are patient and take their time when working with him.<//review>< time>

First time taking my son there. And the girl that helped me was great. Liked the fact that the machines are very quiet and don't scare the kids. My son cried but that's just cause hes a cry baby sometimes the girl was very patient with him and gentle so at time's he forgot he was getting a haircut. Loved it and will be going there from now on they have a new client.< /Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>AMAZING hair salon for kids!  We waited until my son was 2 1/2 to get his first hair cut.  He was so excited and they did such a great job!  Stasha worked with us and was very understanding, cutting a little bit at a time so we could decide as we went what hair style we wanted to go with.  My boy loves getting his hair cut and of course loves playing with the toys before and after.  But he's also great during and loves sitting in the car to get his hair cut.  Highly recommended!<//text><date>1468340831832<//date></record></dataset><record>

Other then that the place is nice with plenty of entertainment for the kids. It's nice how they can watch a movie while they get their hair cut. They also do not take appointments and the wait can be very long.<//Text><username>Blake Estrada<//username>< response>

I cannot be anymore greatful I've found this place!! My sons last haircut experience was so traumatizing for the both of us. I had anxiety to take him again, so I searched online for a place just for kids and had the pleasure of meeting Cassandra! She was amazing with my son!! She had this really caring attitude and a lot of patience for his busy body. I'm definitely impressed with this place!!< /Text>

Took my grandson in for a haircut.. she cut a chunk of skin and a few scratches.  She lied that he came like that .. Beware of this lady wit ur kid the lady with the long black hair and dark skin think she the owner.  She needs retraining.. I was very up set she was unprofessional for liying and cut my grandson.  Go elsewhere</Review>

For a Saturday it was packed but my fiance and I didn't know. So appointment is necessary if you're short on time. There's toys for kids to play also TVs all around playing movies. Prices aren't bad. We paid 25$ including tip.<//review>

They may be good with older kids but they made my child cry and they did not listen to what we wanted. I guess that's why they say you get what you pay for.</Text>< userid>

<Text>Like the kid-friendly environment. Only complaint is they don't know how to do certain styles, like lineups, so the girl refused to do my kid's haircut the way I asked because of this.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c3280b9e373c7d:0x24edd3a17a90d1bc</Gmap_id><userid>116121834784256379190<//userid><user_name>Brenda Calmar< /user_name>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I really like the Service they give. My children love going there and it doesn't matter waiting for a while since with the toy area the kids have fun and don't even tell the cars where they get on to get their hair cut they are Perfect!

(Original)
Me gusta mucho el Servicio que dan. Mis hijos les fascina el ir alli y no importa esperar un rato ya que con el area de juguetes los niños se divierten y ni se diga los carros donde se suben para que les corten el pelo estan Perfectas!< /review>

The massage was amazing, but when scheduled, I was using a gift card my son had given on Mother’s Day. The gift card was not used as payment and I paid full price, after my son had already purchased.

After submitting this above review, the owner reached out and rectified the situation. Very appreciated! The whole experience was amazing and I will be returning and referring! Thank you so!<//text>

I have been going to Bobbi since 2014 when I moved to San Diego and I would not go anywhere else. As a military member massage therapy is just as important to me as exercise, stretching and diet. I went to many different massage therapists throughout San Diego for over a year until I found Bobbi. If you are a person that has muscle and does not think she can make a dent, think again. Every time I have seen her, she has made me feel like she rebuilt me from scratch. That being said, she will listen to your needs if you need something different, makes recommendations, and has a very comforting and calming studio.  I am currently on deployment, almost  ready to come back and Bobbi will be one of my first calls.</Review>

My aches and pains hit the jackpot when I discovered Bodywork by Bobbi several years ago.  Bobbi,  and now Lauren too, are the best! They both have an incredible knowledge of the body's workings and structure,  and are able to trace my physical, and at times, emotional pains to their sources.
They are both genuinely kind, caring and nurturing women and definitely have found their calling.
Their office is clean and relaxing, and their fees are so reasonable.  Plenty of free parking and easy access,  which is an added bonus.<//Text>

Lauren is an amazing Massage Therapist! I was referred by a close friend and as a Chiropractor myself, I’m very picky about my massages. Lauren went above and beyond my expectations. In this business you truly get what you pay for, and Lauren was worth every penny. Thanks again and I will definitely be sending people your way!< /Review>

I never leave Bobbi's Wellness Center without feeling like a new woman. Her massages are perfect and so relaxing, yet revitalizing. You are immediately at peace once you step into her quiet serene massage room. Bobbi puts you at ease instantly and from then on all you have to do is relax and let yourself be pampered by the healing touch of this professional and excellent Massage Therapist. Thanks Bobbi, for always being the Best!<//Review>

Bobbi is excellent! I have a previous back injury which required surgery to repair. I was afraid to let anyone touch my back after this happened. Bobbi made me feel comfortable. Since she has been helping me recover from chronic bone/tissue/joint health issues. I always feel better after my visit! Bobbi is extremely knowledgeable and also gives great advice for upkeep in between my sessions. I recommend bodyworks by Bobbi any chance I get!< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I have been receiving massages on a regular basis from Bobbi for 7 years now. As a fellow Massage Therapist, my standards are very high when it comes to getting bodywork. Bobbi always exceeds my expectations with the work I recieve from her. She has provided me so much relief over the years. I started seeing her during my pregnancy, then continued to see her to treat my whiplash injury from an auto accident. Now I rely on her to help me manage my aches and pains associated with my profession, so that I can continue to work. Her massage style is a balance of focus treatment work combined with relaxation techniques. I always leave feeling amazing! She is knowledgeable, professional, and her warm personality makes you feel comfortable. I highly recommend Bobbi!<//Review>< user_id>

I've been going to Bodywork by Bobbi for years. I always feel better and relaxed after my massage. She custom designs each massage for what I need at the time. She is so knowledgeable and gives me tips for stretches and exercises that would be helpful to me as well. Making this a part of my self-care routine has really helped with the stress and tension that my body holds onto. Thank you!!<//Review>

My first massage with Lauren will not be my last!!  She helped me by massaging out all the shoulder and neck muscle tension I had built up.
She is able to apply the right amount of pressure without making the massage painful.  I highly recommend Lauren for your next massage!!<//Review>

Truly the most compassionate, experienced and caring therapists in La Mesa. I saw Bobbi after knee replacement surgery. Her work completely changed my recovery. She wholeheartedly cared about my recovery and quality of life. I continue to see her and her staff as needed. Her staff is friendly, professional and well educated. I am so thankful for her and her team.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I can’t say enough about Bobbi and her skill set. I’m extremely particular when choosing a massage therapist due to the extreme physical and mental stress of my job. I need deep tissue and a variety of techniques to help heal my repetitive injuries and Bobbi does not disappoint. She is extremely knowledgeable, uses a wide variety of techniques based on your needs, and does so while providing a calm soothing environment to de-stress your mind as well as body.

Bobbi also has a yoga studio right next door to her massage studio and is a phenomenal instructor. She is so full of knowledge about our bodies, how to heal them, and also how to prevent injuries and also hosts talks from time to time about how to do that. Everything Bobbi offers is priced appropriately too. I always felt like I got more for my money when I was able to see her and that doesn’t even include the occasional special or reward program she offers.

Do yourself a favor and get in to see this lady!!! Your body will thank you 😉👌🏻<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80d9577675cd715f:0xb5ec9ccf73ab5bdc< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Bobbi is an amazing massage therapist.  I originally started seeing her 3 years ago for my hip that I needed surgery on.  She helped get me prepared for surgery with therapeutic massages and stretches.  After my total hip replacement I was able to go back to her within 9 weeks and she continued to work with me and strengthen my leg.  I had post operative issues with my thigh after surgery and would "lock up".  Bobbi was amazing and weekly worked on my leg/thigh with her massage skills and within a couple months I was 100% cured and no more lock ups.  I would highly recommend Bobbi - I have been to many massage therapist and will have to say that she is the best and most knowledgeable.  My husband also saw her after a car accident.  She worked on his back and got him pain free as well.  Bobbi is a true gift to my life and has changed it all for the best.< /Review><Rating>5</Rating><response>None< /response><user_id>105695002440682127359</user_id>< name>

<Text>From one healing professional to another, I went to see Bobbi with high expectations and wasn't disappointed. She knew exactly how to tailor the massage to my needs. Bobbi has a deep understanding of anatomy and knows how to apply her skill appropriately. She was able to address my muscle tension very effectively and I felt rejuvenated after receiving a massage from her. I have sent some of my patients to her with confidence and heard only positive feedback about her work. I highly recommend Bobbi for your next therapeutic massage.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><GmapID>0x80d9577675cd715f:0xb5ec9ccf73ab5bdc<//GmapID></record>

<Review>Bobbi is the BEST!! If you have serious ailments and chronic pain, she is your gal, but she can also give relaxing massages as well. I have serious, chronic pain in my neck because of an injury from 4 years ago, and it took me years to find someone with her qualifications that can actually get deep enough to the root of my injury. Bobbi was a referral a co-worker gave me, and I'll never go anywhere else. Bobbi is not just a massage therapist; she is educated in the human anatomy and understands how all of our parts and pieces connect. Shes also gives me tips and techniques for stretches I can do to ease the pain and showed me how to do these stretches after one of our first sessions. No other massage therapist has ever put in that time with me. Her prices are a steal considering how fantastic she is. Bobbi also has a lot of stamina. I'm a bigger sized gal, but my size has never affected the quality of my massage. Bobbi is a warm, natural healer, and I'm so thankful to have found a therapist  like her who I can trust with my chronic pain.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Bobbi is so knowledgeable about the body that her hands are magnetized to the problem areas. She immediately found the root of my issues and was diligent about finding a solution. I feel very comfortable and at ease in her studio location, and calmed by the peaceful sensory experience.

Bobbi is very grounded and gets to the point, so she isn't chatty which allows me to fully be present in the feeling of releasing the tension... I enjoyed the experience both times I have visited her and will be back again in the future!<//text>< Date>

<text>Bodywork by Bobbi Wellness Center

Bodywork by Bobbi is a small company with a large future. I met Bobbi just three years ago (2016) At first I was hesitant and figured I was only ‘risking’ a custom massage fee $75/hr. Within five minutes of speaking with Bobbi she made it her goal to get me on the path to physical recovery and wellness. Bobbi shared her background and experience in difficult bodily injuries. I had been injured over three years when we met. I have been seeking therapy on a regular schedule with Bobbi multiple times a month, her professionalism is astounding. Never once has my appointment been forgotten/double scheduled or has my start time been delayed. She gives friendly text/email reminders and has never charged me a late cancellation fee even though I have had a couple. Bobbi understands that life can be hard and she sympathizes with the patient. Unlike the larger corporations which focus on profits.
More than a Masseuse...
Over the years I look to Bobbi as less of a therapist and more of a friend. We have great conversations regarding our dog-children, vacation plans and more. Her caring and fun loving personality makes it a double treat every time I book an appointment. I originally came to the wellness center seeking desperate help for a chronic back-pain. I have now branched into Core Strengthening and even Yoga classes.
The Classes are just right for me! A small group so I can blend in and still get one on one guidance. The other attendees are always polite and caring. I feel good personalities attract good people. The best of both are found here. The classes are fun yet challenging. I have never done the same course twice, she keeps it new and spices it up every week. From exercise balls to ropes hanging from the ceiling, I am always in surprise of what she has hidden up her sleeve.
I’m OCD, are you?
Cleanliness and comfort are very important for me to be able to relax. From the scent of the linens to the aroma diffuser, the whole office smells heavenly. The room is always at the perfect temperature and the massage table even has a heating option if you want to take a nap like I do. A clean room is a sign of a clear mind. Sometimes I want to go just to forget about the troubles of the world.
The Extra Mile-
Recently I had surgery and a five inch scar remains. Bobbi knew just what to do and began scar tissue massage as soon as the doctor permitted. Already I’m regaining feeling in my tissue and the scar is looking much better.
Quality is what counts!
If you want a boring and expensive big name company, this is not the right place. Looking back I recall being nervous at my first appointment and only smiling now as I can see how much I have healed and grown in these past few years. I owe Bobbi more than a simple thank you, but friends don’t need to say that.</text><Rate>5</Rate>< pictures>

I recently had my first massage with Bobbi for some lingering injuries from running, lifting, and sports.  I have been to many different massage therapists over the years and it amazes me how different they can be.  Bobbi was by far the best massage and teacher of massage therapy I have ever been to.  She showed me some exercises I can do outside of massage to help strengthen muscles so I don't have so many problems.  She truly is an artist of her craft and she does it very well.  I highly recommend going to see her!<//text>

<Review>I have been going to Bobbi for two and a half years and that was after trying multiple massage therapist in the San Diego area. She is extremely knowledgeable and always has the best interest of the client at heart. Not only will she customize the massage to the exact areas that need attention she will also talk with you about ways to stretch in order to prevent recurring issues. I would highly recommend Bobbi to anyone looking for  a great, relaxing, therapeutic massage.</Review><date>1427385683804<//date><user_name>Jessica Treadwell<//user_name>< user>

Bobbi is simply amazing!  She approaches massage from a scientific perspective and really performs physical therapy through masterful massage technique.  No massage is the same and she always begins the session with an interview and adjusts her approach accordingly.  I have sent countless family and friends to her.  Everyone, to the person, comes back to me and thanks me for the wonderful experience they had with Bobbi.  Wish there were six stars!< /Text>

<text>The first thing that was different about going to Bobbi was she sat down with me and really took interest in finding out all of my problem areas.  She took notes and each time I return she has done her homework and knows what I need.  I had some back issues which she helped resolve and the last time I went to see her she gave me the most relaxing and refreshing massage that had me on the verge of sleeping. So whether you need a deep therapeutic massage or just need to relax after a stressful week or even something in between Bobbi is definitely the masseuse for you!</text>< Pictures>

I used to think massages were just "pampering" until I had some real back issues from an injury, and eventually my wife "forced" me to go to Bobbi. Amazingly, Bobbi was able to address the problem as a professional therapist, and was key to my rehabilitation. I will definitely try to go to her more now because I see the benefits of her specific work.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>If you need a true massage therapist then Bobbi is the therapist for you. It has been 6 months since I could get a massage due to shoulder surgery. I know I needed some real deep tissue work and would need a massage therapist who was strong enough to break and loosen up a very bound and tight mass.

Breaking up scar tissue is not easy for a therapist and not easy for the recipient but is must be done for a better quality of life. Well Bobbi was able to break up some very tough tissues and I will admit it wasn't pleasant at the time but the results were fantastic a few days later. Much more flexibility now and I know after a couple more visits I will have a more normal shoulder & back thanks to her true deep tissue therapeutic massage skills.

If you are looking for a deep tissue sports massage specialist call Bobbi.<//Review>< Pictures>

My wife first went to Bobbi with a sore shoulder which Bobbi was able to help her with. My wife came back extremely satisfied with her treatment and how relaxing it was. The next time was my turn I also had a sore shoulder and lower back after explaining what I wanted she was able to pinpoint the knots in my muscles and relieve the pain and soreness. I am a racquetball player making me a one sided athlete so I need therapeutic massage a little more often than most. I have had people give me massages but they never addressed my problem. Bobbi sits you down and talks over your needs and tries to address them. She is the absolute best at her profession.<//text>

Having broken my neck in a car accident nearly 30 years ago and being a long-time dancer with bad hips and a lower back, I've had a number of massages in my lifetime.  I am very picky about who I let work on my body, and I trust Bobbi to know what she is doing and to get the job done right.  She can get into the knots when I have them (which is frequently) and do light strokes when my body just needs some TLC.  She's not only does great work, but also takes the time to educate me on my body with tips to help prevent reoccurring injuries.  Stepping into her massage room is like stepping into another world - a little oasis in the chaos of life.  I always leave her office feeling relaxed and healthy!<//text>

I showed up for my appointment and she had double booked it. She did not apologize or in any way try to make it right. When I did not reschedule on the spot she said, "Ok, have a nice day." That was it. She was rude and unprofessional. I went to her several times before and referred 4 other people to her - clearly she doesn't care who her customers are. She knew exactly who I was when I told her my name and by her initial reaction I'm fairly certain she double booked on purpose because she was mad about rescheduled prior appointment even though it was rescheduled within the time frame she requires. I highly recommend spending your time and money with someone who isn't vindictive and respects their customer's time and loyalty.<//Text>

< Review>
Was just trying to add someone to my free 3 month membership, they did not know how to help me and practically told me I had to figure it out myself. Apart from that, he kept persisting me to just add to my membership to “save the hassle” made it seem like all they cared about was the money. Why would I pay to add someone when I specifically went there to take advantage of adding someone for free 3 months? They did not give me friendly service and was making rude smart remarks such as if she was even going to continue after the free 3 months. That’s obviously the purpose of trying it out for 3 months.<//Review>

<text>Best LA Fitness I've ever visited. The equipment is new and the facility has everything you could want (pool, new HIIT studio, TRX bands/balls/kettle bells, basketball court, saunas, etc). Two floors. The staff were very sweet. Recently, I sprained my ankle, and the staff helped open the door for me and walk me to the arm machines. Everyone is welcoming.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Their 5-day trial process is ridiculous. Unlike every other gym, at LA Fitness you cannot walk in and sign up for a trial to get to know the gym. They require you to do it 24 hours in advance online. We weren’t able to work out today as a result unless we wanted to pay $15 a day. Customer service was not helpful. Rather than wanting to get to know the gym in the future and getting a pass we will likely go somewhere else with better customer support and service.< /Text>

I love all the amenities but its just waaaaay to busy. All they care about is making quick money. The trainers treat you like a number instead of a client.  They harass called my friends over and over even after saying they weren't interested.  They dont greet you when you come in or say anything when you leave. Unfortunately I think I need to go back to Planet Fitness.  Its cheaper and my workout is just overall a better experience.< /Review>

<Response>None<//Response><text>I have been a member of this gym since it opened several years ago.  The staff has improved over the years and more times than not, they are friendly at the front desk.  I think the gym has a lot to offer, including good trainers, and will be the experience that you make of all the options.

My two complaints are that the management needs to hire a janitorial staff for the ladies locker room to clean often during the day.  Numerous times I find that the floor has hair, trash, Q-tips, you name it.  Yuck.  The toilet stalls need to be replaced, but in the meantime, they need to be stocked with paper products and cleaned often.  The showers have hair in the stalls and random other trash.  It is a let down after a great workout to see the poor condition of the locker room facilities.

My second complaint is the temperature of the pool.  It is too warm.  Once people get moving then the initial cool feeling changes to comfortable.  The warm water is almost a bath tub, so it is not invigorating.</text><gmapID>0x80c27dfcfdf1c20b:0x10f9a0e32b3abd< /gmapID><time>1379283086823< /time><user_id>108585327615208151406< /user_id>< rating>

<Text>I'm a regular at this place. Gym has some positives but also negatives. Big place, tons of equipment. As big as it is, they manage to not have enough mat space during busy times. They take months to fix/maintain partially working equipment.

Phone reception here is really bad because there are high voltage transmission lines right outside - so that's not changing anytime soon, the gym should offer free wifi to make up for that. During busy hours you might have to park pretty far away, but usually there are still spots.

They have a great selection of free weights, unfortunately that is also what causes this gym to be drowning in bros, from the Santa Clarita hardbois to the San Fernando cholobros, bad tattoos for everyone. So if you want to use the weights you'll need to navigate bro culture, communicating with primate-like grunts and nods. They won't be racked or organized unless employees have time to do it, seems like once a day. And you won't be surprised to find equipment regularly damaged because someone used it incorrectly.

The bros also try their best to make the locker rooms and showers disgusting, while the staff occasionally cleans up after them. Grossest part is the smell in the bathrooms, my guess is that's related to the roiders (handicap stall seems to be a favorite place to shoot those btw).

Overall this gym appears to offer a lot due to the size, but in use it's like any normal size gym. For me there's more downsides than up, but it's close and gets the job done.<//Text>< Pictures>

That's not to say it doesn't get crowded here, because it absolutely does. Customer service is a bit sad, but that's to be expected with an LA Fitness.

I'm sorry but when you have someone working the front desk (Megan) they should be courteous and polite to anyone who calls. I got an "obviously! " when I asked a question and "there is no one here to help you!" I understand if you are having a bad day but when you can hear her making comments tok others when she thought she put you on hold, that's just rude!</text>

My review Focuses on management so-called manager (Carlos Martin) Before coming here with my five day pass I had read many bad reviews about this manager (yelp) (google).  But I decided to give it a chance I signed up online and received a five day pass right away came in the first day spoke to a gentleman called Alberto promises you all kinds of fake promotions. Including a 15 day free trial which no one has ever heard of do yourself a favor and get your membership online . Very unprofessional people now I understand why there’s so many bad reviews about this Manager . I would rather go out of my way and go to Golden Valley LA fitness 2/3/2018 update they don’t even know who they call this idiot called me offering me a membership when I already have one lol Through corporate o down 29.99 a month . still trying to rip me off offering me a membership for 199 +2999 a A month lol I guess steroids get to your head you don’t even know who you’re calling anymore Chillax Carlos<//Text>

The most disgusting, lazy employees.... nothing is ever wiped down... SWEAT everywhere.... People take weights to different places or rooms... never put back....Most DISGUSTING GYM Ive ever been in.... and Ive been in gyms for 40 years!! They keep the good equipment locked up where no one can get to them....  unless you bought trainer time....  Thats ridiculous.... Their Sales People wont leave you alone while your working out.... this gym is all about sales.... NO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION!!! I am waiting for a return phone call from the Manager.... we will see if I am willing to edit this at all....< /review>

Very large gym, don't remember the last time I had to wait for a machine. The personal training area and the new STRETCH area is a bit of an eyesore frankly. Lastly, they close way too early on the weekend. 10pm on Friday and 8pm on Saturday and Sunday. Often see 20-30 people still at the club when they close.</Text>

<Review>Signed up for a membership here only to then be asked to comply with policies that were never explained or provided to me before I signed up for my membership.  I contacted the corporate office only to be told that not everything is in the document I signed, like that is somehow acceptable, that I should be expected to comply with any rule they ever make with no documentation or explanation required.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I like the set up the best at this location in SCV. Has the most equipment and separated nice workout area. Downside is finding parking and expect it to be busier than the other LAF.  (Need Wifi). Also, agressive membership managers and sales staff. Better to sign up at other location.<//review>< pictures>

<Name>Bill Guthrie< /Name><Review>Great place. I'll give it a 5th star after they fix a rather long punch list of the clean & repairs (C&R) that are needed. Lockers (broken, doorless), restrooms: plumbing, constantly out of paper towels, TP, shower stalls messed up, no soap, dirty floors, benches often dirty -- general C&R maintenance.</Review></record></dataset><record>
<review>Pretty good layout. They recently did some minor renovations, and rearranging. Added a large personal training area at the back of the cardio room and reduced the size of the open space area in the weight room causing some crowding in the walkways.

This is one of the locations that doesn't offer WiFi for members. The cell service is real bad in that area so plan ahead and download your playlist or you will have to listen to the house playlist.< /review>< rate>

Locker room is always filthy.
Location changes the water aerobics instructor constantly.
I avoid Lilia's class as she is a very poor instructor.  Today I checked the instructor for water aerobics at 6 pm and it had substituted Apollonia for Jeanette.  When I arrived at LA Fitness, the schedule said Appolonia.  The instructor who showed up was Lilia.  I cannot believe this club would not update instructor for a class.

Lilia just yells and screams; only knows one routine and does not give one a decent cardio workout.

Grimmway farms, the largest carrot farmers in the world.  They have several packing sheds throughout Bakersfield, Arvin, Shafter and Lamont.  They farm throughout the state of California and also in Oregon and Colorado
This location is their citrus packaging shed. They are a great organization.</Review>

< Review>
Hugh Collars staff is the best. I’ve been a client for over 20 years. Their office handles mine and my family’s insurance needs. The office manager, Lori is simply amazing. Never misses a beat. She’s so knowledgeable, resourceful and remembers every detail of past conversations. Not sure how she does this last one but I know that I can ALWAYS count on her!!! Can she be cloned??? Thank you Lori for always making me feel like I’m the most important client.< /Review>

Lori, at Hugh Kollar  State Farm Insurance office is reliable, kind, and thorough and will take as much time as you  need to help you. when you call. We recently added a secondary medical insurance policy to cover the 20% that Medicare does not pay. Typically, after a hospital stay or even Dr. visits you will be advised by the health services you received, that you may owe money. With our State Farm policy and Lori I feel confident about our future medical Ins. needs. i can recommend without any reservation State Farm. Ask for Lori when you call.< /Text>

<review>Every person in Hugh's office, as well as Hugh himself, is a joy to work with! Hugh has been my insurance agent for several years now and I always get prompt, cheerful responses to any questions I might have. Office Manager Lori Elder is very informed and has helped answer many questions I've had over the years, even if it doesn't directly result in making a sale! Which is why I trust them; they're available, go the extra mile, and have celebrated milestones with me as I've needed more insurance coverage (first renter's insurance, then car, then added on my partner's car, then engagement ring coverage, and hopefully homeowner's in the future!). Last, but not least, State Farm has given a dividend to their auto policyholders; I was just informed that I'll be receiving a check in the mail for over $300. This was a shock! But, in a time when many people are going through financial turmoil, I feel like Hugh, his office, and State Farm, care about my well-being. I feel safe, secure, appreciated, and taken care of. Thank you!< /review>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I've been with State Farm for a decades, but only 4 years in Carlsbad.  I've always had Roadside Assistance added to my auto policy for less than $8 a year.  You never know when it's going to be needed.  I've had broken keys, leaky radiators, flat tires, and the most recent yesterday, a bad starter.  With Roadside Assistance you can call any tow truck operator, then email a copy of the bill to State Farm and they'll mail you a check.  This happened this morning with an email to Lori in Hugh Kollar's agency.   I sent the email with a copy of my $105 towing bill at 10:42, by 11:00 Lori sent an email that the check was in the mail.  I could never understand why so many people use AAA, when there is a better and less costly solution for roadside assistance.</Review>< date>

<review>Very responsive! I initially emailed Hugh to inquire about insurance for my Photography business. Although he was out of the office at the time, he sent my inquiry to Lori and she followed up immediately. Lori was very professional and helpful! She handled everything so quickly and made the process so easy for me. Highly recommend reaching out for your insurance needs!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1620661857366, 'text': "HI Ally, I'm glad we were able to help you with your small business insurance.

I am extremely happy that I found this State Farm branch. Shout out to Lori Ann! She is beyond nice and professional! I had Costco car insurance and thought I was getting the best deal out there and I was wrong! Lori Ann helped me get the best deal and best coverage! I am now working with her to insure my business as well. I know I'm in good hands. 👍< /Text>

Huge Kollar's staff is exceptional, particularly Lori.  It is invaluable to be able to email or call the office and actually get someone who cares, and get resolution to issues ... whether it is for a change in billing, advice on what changes to make to your coverage, or help with a claim.  The rates a fair, and the service is great.  I would highly recommend State Farm and this office in particular.< /Review>

I was blown away at the service I received from Lori Elder and Frances Sharp!

Moving into my apartment was no hassle. They sent over the rental insurance documents asap and resolved any information gaps with my apartment complex.

Nothing beats a stress free process!< /text>

When we had him review our prior policies (with another company) he helped us not only reduce our payments, but also explained some things that we ended up adding to ensure we are fully protected (home, fire, theft, etc).  We have had a few claims over the years and his executive assistant Lori is immediately on it getting us take care of- she really knows her craft as well. My husband and I would highly recommend Hugh Kollars State Farm Insurance Agency!</Review></record>

We’ve been with Hugh Kollar and State Farm for 5 years.  From the first call with Hugh, to filing a claim and working with his fantastic staff, we were always treated like family.  Hugh is always available and takes time to help us weigh the options available to us. We started by insuring our cars now look to Hugh and State Farm for everything we want to insure.  Great agent. Better person.  Everyone on his team is A+!!< /Review>

Although State Farm was unable to insure me due to my 'busy' driving history, Lori was extremely helpful in providing advice that led to me securing much improved car insurance with another provider.  I look forward to working with Lori in the future once I become more insurable!

Cheers for your help & friendly character.< /Text>

Lori Ann Elder is so knowledgeable and professional. She helped me recently with a transfer of auto insurance to another state. She explained what needed to be done, but then — she did all the follow up for me! Now that’s incredible. You rarely see that type of customer service today and with a pleasant attitude. Thank you Lori!<//Text>

I have been with State Farm for many years for my auto policy, but until recently, I had my home owners policy with another company.  Christine assisted greatly with my transition in setting up my home owners insurance policy.  Overall, I have been very happy with her responsiveness and the policy put in place.<//Review>

<review>I recently purchased insurance through State Farm and Lori Ann Elder has been a 10/10 . She not only got me a low rate but a significantly greater coverage which is amazing. She is the best , I would never ever consider anyone else for my insurance needs.<//review>< Pictures>

I have been Hugh Kollar's customer since 2003. Over the years, his agency has insured my home, auto, life and my businesses. I have worked with both Hugh and Lori on this team. I find both of them to be highly efficient and responsive. I had a fire damage on one of my retail store, even though we went through tough time,  Hugh and his team made sure that insurance coverage and payout is one less thing to worry about.  There are very few businesses which delivers consistency quality and value, they have done it for me for almost 20 years. I chose to do business with Hugh & Lori who happen to be representing State Farm.<//text>

I was referred to State Farm by my best friend. She lived on a cul de sac, here in San Diego, which was affected by wildfires. Out of 13 homes on the street, 7 were destroyed by fire, and the other 6 suffered severe smoke damage. Every single homeowner had to make an insurance claim. Since all the neighbors were going through the same thing, it was very clear which insurance companies were taking care of their customers and which were not. State Farm stood out above the rest. My friend and her family were one of the first ones back in their home. State Farm found them really nice temporary housing while the repairs were made. When they returned to their home, it was as good as new. Having insurance is important, but having the RIGHT insurance company is even more crucial.
Hugh and LoriAnn are the best. The personalized service they offer is second to none. I rarely need to call the office, but every single time they immediately know exactly who I am and have my account information at their fingertips. With them, I feel confident that I have exactly the right insurance coverage for my needs, nothing more and nothing less.</Review>

I have been a client of Hugh Kollar for many years. Both Hugh and his agent, Lori are amazing.
They both go above and beyond to make sure all our insurance needs are met.

<text>Most of us have insurance that we rarely use, thankfully. But if there ever comes a time when you need to make a claim, the team at Hugh Kollar State Farm Agency in Carlsbad should be the number one pick for a group that understands when you are in a predicament that requires you to call upon your coverage and acts with such speed to get you taken care of, that you hardly experience any downtime at all.

We have been a valued client of theirs for over 20 years both personally and commercially and I would highly recommend you talk to them. They may not be the least expensive at first but if you think of extra care and concern as saving you valuable time and costs, they really are comparable to online insurance companies in the long run.

Lori Ann Elder deserves a special shout out as she is knowledgeable and you can always feel her smile through the phone.

These guys are tops.< /text><user_id>104874598752354824135< /user_id></record>

Hugh and his team are incredibly personable, helpful, responsive and patient.  As a full time photographer I needed property, equipment and liability coverage and the process of getting quotes and information from other insurance carriers was painful!  Hugh made it easy, affordable and provided the level of customer service and care that we believe is important in serving others well. Hugh even responded to my email WHILE on vacation!!   Thank you Hugh and Julie for making this so easy...I now have peace of mind knowing everything is taken care of and that any time I have a need or question you are only an email or phone call away!</review>

As a business owner I have always appreciated the immediate assistance and personal touch that I have consistently received over the years from Hugh and his amazing staff. We have had our company's workman's compensation policy with Hugh since 2006.
Over the last  7 years Hugh and his staff have also have provided us with the same level of personal, professional and courteous attention with our home owners and rental insurance policies.

Thank you Hugh, Julie, Lori and Nick<//Text>

One of my clients in Lake Oswego, Oregon is moving to Carlsbad, California and I needed to find a State Farm agent located close to my clients new office.  One phone call to Hugh Kollar's office is all it took to seamlessly move my clients insurance to beautiful Carlsbad.  I spoke to his representative, Mary Ellen, and she took care of all the details.  Like a good neighbor...<//text>

<Text>Harry’s Marine life is mine and many others go to shop for all things livestock when it comes to the marine hobby! Some of, if not the best prices in the U.S. Harry’s boasts a large selection of thriving fish, inverts, and corals. To top it off their customer service is top of the line. Very helpful and responsive! Always going out of their way to make sure you’re happy with your purchase and the whole process before and after. I deal with Will a lot, he’s super helpful. I will continue to support this business.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>They have a large variety of salt water fish to choose from. So if you can't find a certain fish this is the place for you. Also have crustaceans and corals . Just do your research before you go out and buy.<//Text>< user>

Great selection of fish and corals. David and Craig are both very friendly and helpful.  They also take your frags in trade for their items. I have traded for some fish i never would have purchased due to the cost. Harry's is a store you definitely don't want to miss.< /review>

Coral prices are all really high. Fish selection is very limited. Went multiple weeks in a row with no new fish. Meh. Not bad, but not great.</Text>

Ordered a glock 17 kit with a magazine. Shipping date kept getting pushed back. Reached out and got extremely rude service. Tried to cancel my order to take my hard earned money elsewhere,
but was unable to do so. My order finally arrived with no magazine. Never doing business with these people again.</text>

Got my order in.  It was a wait but not f&fs fault. They are also waiting for suppliers to deliver.  They've been great at communicating and helpful. Everyone needs to be more patient or go ahead and pay the exagerrated premium elsewhere to get yours sooner.< /Text>

I ordered something worth more than $400 dollars from this store in July 2020 and I've been calling and emailing but no response. I really wonder if I'll ever get help.< /text>

<Review>Ordered on July 22 last year and was going to ask for a refund the beginning of March this year 21 after waiting for so long but instead received a shipping label notification from the post office. The staff have responded to my emails within a reasonable time being a day or two when asked about the hold up these prior months. Not sure what the hold up was but I do acknowledge purchasing my Glock 23 kit while placed on backorder. Received my kit March 5 after two day priority mail shipping. A co worker of mine has also purchased two kits which-took three   months for him to receive sometime last summer. His kits as well as mine came out fully functional and ready to go as expected. Definitely can’t beat the price at 445.00. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was the pandemic that caused things to slow down nonetheless it was worth the wait since I cant seem to get this 23 kit anywhere else. Appreciate f and f for the low prices abs great quality. Would purchase from them again if things were to speed up a bit.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dcc945545f0c1f:0x798415efce08690b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I surprisingly received a product 5 months and 27 days after ordering. I actually ordered a different kit from a different website and promptly emailed FNF for a refund. I received the other websites kit in the mail before FNF even responded to my email. They didn't want to refund me so asked if I wanted a different kit, at this point I said ill just take the kit cause I didn't think I'd get anything either way. Surprisingly they sent the other kit that they told me they would even though the website said they had nothing in stock. Overall, id say its worth paying double the price for a kit from somewhere else than ever subjecting yourself to dealing with this company. They do get 2 stars for sending a product though</text>

The most horrible service I have ever received it's been over 6 months and still have not received my items. Also asking for more money for upgrades too ship faster.</text>

Let me say I am very impressed with F&F. I just had a conversation with Chris and his team for about 1 hour. The industry is very hard right now. Getting product in and getting orders out is the hardest it has ever been, Chris is a guy that is trying his best to keep customers happy. Unfortunately people that don’t understand the industry have a hard time understanding. If anyone remembers the GST9 fiasco F&F gave customers their money back plus $50. I haven’t heard any other company do that. ROCK ON F&F I’ll be placing more orders with you in the near future.<//text>

After 22 weeks of waiting and endless emails I cancelled my order. Make sure you go through your credit card company and not the vendor to cancel. Google images doesn’t even show an actual store front for them. Deplorable business is a nice way of saving the expletives. Fraud is all I can say.

VERY DISAPPOINTED, VERY DISRESPECTFUL, VERY RUDE, POOR BUSINESS PRACTICES

I ordered more than $800 worth of stuff from them in July of 2020. They split my order to send me what they had. I communicated back and forth even changed my order so it would ship faster. Well fast forward to Feburary 2021(Thats 7 months for anyone who is counting)  I finally asked what was an estimated ship date, because I grew tired of waiting, mind you I was very respectful and very polite through this whole process. Then all the sudden they somthing came available.  So good deal, only thing is it was slightly different than what we agreed on but that is all that was avalible. But it could ship today so I said proceed and was thrilled that this lingering 415.00 worth of merchandise I was still owed was finally going to be shipped. Well then they proceed to tell me that I owed 60 more dollars because part of it was upgraded. So I proceeded to tell them that I wasn't paying anymore and that could ship what they had,  which they offered to me, or refund me my money in a firm but polite way. Well that's when they proceed to say that they were not a charity and that just because I had to wait a few months that I didn't deserve anything. So they had my money for 7 months I did everything I could to accommodate them like changing my order then they say they have something to satisfy my order but I've got to pay more truly disappointed.  I proceeded to tell them that I was not a loan service that I want my refund for product that I played for. At this point they insulted me calling me foolish and that I had no understanding of how back orders work. So for anyone who had the misfortune of dealing with this company I am truly sorry this company is slack and a bully hopefully it will see the error of its ways and make right all customers that it has strung along and insulted.</review>

<Review>I wanted to take the time to write a review after my experience. First I'd like to say that I had read all the negative reviews people have left but I can not agree. Granted it took considerably longer for me to get my order than originally anticipated but the whole industry is backed up and there isn't a whole lot they can do. I stayed in touch with them regularly and they returned each and everyone of my emails letting me know they were still working on things. Further more because I understood that how delayed things were and wasn't ever argumentative or irrate with them they called me personally to see what they could do to get me what I needed. Again, yes it took a while but these guys are going as fast as they can and doing the absolute best with what they have to work with. I know it musty be hard maintaining a professional attitude dealing with so many impatient customers and my hat is off to you guys for really going the extra mile to help me. I will continue to to business with this company in the future.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Website states waiting 21 days for orders to ship (due to current environment) completely understandable. Well I’ve waited double that time & still waiting. Horrible communication from this company. If you’re looking for a build I’d suggest you look else where. They’ll take your money in a heartbeat but won’t live up to their terms</Text>< Response>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>I placed an order in July 19, 2020. It is October 24, 2020, and my order still has not updated passed “processing, on back order”. The site says by ordering with them you accept a 2-3 month backlog in fulfilling your order. Well, it’s been three months and they can’t even update my order status. I’m so frustrated at this point I may put in a complaint with the BBB.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

14 weeks and order never shipped. never got an update or anything. Never buying anything from this company ever again. Just get it off of eBay or some where else. You have a better chance at getting your product from a shady eBay user than these people.<//Text>

<text>Haven’t talk to anyone yet.i did order a kit and it’s been over two months now ,and I haven’t even gotten a confirmation. There’s no way in hell that anyone would give this company anything more than one star ,much less five stars. I’ve ordered parts from a different company week’s after I ordered from them and received it week’s ago. I’m going to try to get a hold one time and then I’m calling my bank and filling a complaint I’m going to give the three days to respond. I should have read the reviews first. Shame on me.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I also waited 6 months for my product and it's very disappointing. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. Not only was it missing necessary parts, I received mixed parts for 4 different imcompatible models including the "SLIDE". My patience was wasted! I can back anyone's negative experience with this sham of a company. They are "BLACKLISTED" for a reason... I basically waited 6 months to
receive a paperweight...stay away!</Review>

DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS WEBSITE! Customer service is horrible and they charge 10% cancellation fee on your order. Why should we be penalized for anything? The website said a product was in stock and when calling after multiple times and finally speaking to someone, we were told it was on back order. So basically false advertising at it's finest. We were told to wait and it would be shipped at the end of the month. Which we had already waited almost a month. After waiting till the end of that month that it was ordered we still waited another 2 weeks before just canceling the order and losing out on 10% of our money. I don't care if the prices are so great that is no excuse to false advertise, give us attitude when we call and then slap a fee to cancel. If I were you I wouldn't buy from these people. So think twice and don't fall into the horrible experience we had to deal with. And don't believe the ones saying that the bad reviews are fake, because majority rules with bad reviews over the good ones.<//Text>

Very disappointed with the way Mr Flores does business... told me to contact polymer 80 in regards to why he sent me a Completely different build kit then what I ordered... color and all. Wouldn’t recommend doing business here. Plenty of other options out there!< /Review>

<Text>Wow do not order from this company how disappointing I spent over $1400 and ordered a few different Glock kits first off they sent me the wrong colors and took about 4 months for my order in the first place after I emailed them about 20’times they barely sent my order out I thought about canceling it so many times but they charge a fee if you decide to do that also they sent me the wrong molds for the kits complete disregard and horrible customer service

“We only sent the black colored frame because that is the only color Polymer 80 is shipping to dealers at this time. We didnt want you waiting any longer over the color so we sent what we had. “

This was their answer as to why they just completely disregard your order and ship out anything they have laying around just to say they completed your order do not order anything from this site you will be very unsatisfied in the end. I will never place another order through this company I wish I had seen the reviews before this but there’s a reason why they have 2 star reviews because they don’t care about their customers and choose to do what ever they feel is correct if you cannot keep up with the demand than don’t give us the option to choose color combinations or certain kits if you cannot meet the demand I wish there was a zero star rating you guys don’t deserve  my 1 star rating< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dcc945545f0c1f:0x798415efce08690b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They shipped out what I said price was fairly good.It took about three and a half months to get it but considering the fact that nobody has them in stock. I bought the 26 Glock building kit. They're good about answering your emails when you.

Not only have I not got any excuses nor did they complain at all that we have sent over 25 emails back and forth, constantly being updated on my or even in hard times with mass orders it takes a little patience, but we are all human no one is perfect! I did order the G19 I love the gun this will be my third polymer frame I’m building on and I choose FandF Firearms for just that!

<review>Wow, great service and a genuine care for each customer as these guys do their best to get everyone's orders taken care of. I've personally bought six build kits from F and F firearms and am super happy with their service and product. If anyone doing a negative review has tried to get these same kits from anyone else you would know how hard it is to get them. National backorders and the general state of politics right now has made their lives hell as well. I say F and F is just about the best company out there doing this business. Keep up the great work team. And let me add this note for anyone new. If you cant develop a good relationship with this company then you should avoid buying from here as well as trying to develop a relationship anywhere else or with anyone, because Chris F. And his team are the easiest people to deal with. As for me, im a customer for life or as long as Chris owns and runs this company.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
I bought the G19 Threaded barrel kit on july 29 and at first I was a little worried but after speaking back and forth with Chris Flores (who is a really cool dude) and sending my proof of address I was assured that I will be receiving my order soon! Also you gotta understand with all the pandemic and everything happening in this day and age alot of people are buying guns and F&F is filling alot of orders the best they can so my advice is just be patient with them and you won't be let down. I look forward to building my G19 polymer 80 and I will be buying from F&F again in the future. Thanks Chris for putting up with my impatient a** and keep up the good work! Yes I would reccomend F&F to a friend.< /Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Horrible company to do business with. Just like the rest of the real reviews, they sell you a product that says in stock, but after you pay you find out that's not the case. After two months of calling and sending emails with zerrrrrrooooo response (so obviously customer service is non existent. And the FKs they give are zero) I had to hand it off to my bank to get my money back.

I'll definitely be checking company reviews before I make a purchase of this type in the future. If I would have seen all these reviews and seeing how big a dumpster fire this company is I would have stayed far far away.</review>< pictures>

So I made an order for a kit right in the middle of the pandemic and it’s on backorder, ok so is everybody else, I waited patiently and I’m glad I did. I was offered an upgraded slide for dirt cheap and they had me a tracking number in minutes. Over the course of my wait Chris always answered my emails about updates, I see lots of people leaving negative reviews because they had to wait but go anywhere else and you’ll still have to wait. F and F came through and I won’t hesitate to order from them again.< /review>

I ordered a complete kit about a month and a half ago and still haven’t got anything. I did get an email confirmation when I first purchased it but that was about it. I’m still waiting for my kit but how much longer will it take? Hopefully I didn’t get scam by this dude smhh.< /Review>

As of now it has been a week bu I have had zero response except that they did in fact receive my order. I have emailed them twice with zero response. I ordered from another company and had a great experience but they were out of the 80% kit I wanted so I found these folks and I wish I would’ve read the reviews. I hope I’m wrong and that I get a response soon. I’m feeling pretty scammed right now though.< /text>

They give an time to ship that doesn’t look too bad and when months go by without hearing from them they charge you a restocking fee to cancel an order that they themselves never even had “in stock”. What exactly are you restocking if you never had it to sell? Now im out a restocking fee because i refuse to wait months when i was told 2 weeks.   They also don’t answer their phones. Avoid this company.<//text>

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I purchased a Glock 19 slide with RMR cut online because it stated that it was in stock on their website. After I made the purchase, I received my invoice stating the product I just ordered was on back order. I wanted to call to cancel my order since I found another place that actually had it in stock. I tried to call their customer service number, but received their voicemail stating they are not answering their phone due to the COVID 19 pandemic - which is understandable. I sent them an e-mail instead, as that was the communication method they are using.

In my e-mail, I explained that I would like to cancel my order because when I ordered it – their website showed it was in stock, but turns out it wasn’t, and I found another place that did have it in stock. Two days after, I received an e-mail from Chris Flores stating that there would be a $25 cancellation fee with my order if I decided to proceed and told me to keep my order to avoid the fee.

I’m very upset by the entire situation – I ordered this under the understanding from their advertisement online that it was in stock and ready to ship, but it wasn’t. I cancelled within 3 days (before anything even shipped obviously since it is on back order) and explained my reasoning. How are you going to charge your customers $25 to cancel their order for your false advertisement?  I could understand charging me the $25 if the product was in stock and was being prepared for shipment, but that was not the case.

As if that wasn’t enough of a problem with them stealing from me and false advertisement, their customer service was extremely rude over e-mail and VERY inconsiderate, short, no explanation, and/or any other options other than, “just keep your order and you won’t be charged a cancellation fee.”

I highly recommend NOT to work with these thieves - they are unprofessional, rude, and stealing people’s money for THEIR mistakes.<//Review>

<Review>Cannot reach these people. The phone number listed on the website seems to not be associated with the business. I have called multiple times regarding my order ($300) and have not been able to speak to anyone. I emailed them as well and no response. They shipped one of the items ordered, but it had missing pieces (missing the Trigger Housing Pin and Slide Lock Spring), but guess what, since I cannot reach them I cannot get this fixed! I am still waiting on any type of confirmation/shipping # on my other order. Definitely not worth the hassle to deal with this company. Taking my money elsewhere.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

What a great, quick and easy experience with FandF not gonna lie was on the edge after reading some of these google reviews but if you head over to their Facebook page the reviews are a lot more creditable and also if you have any questions send them a quick message and Chris does a good job at trying to get back to everyone all in all processed and shipped in 4 business days beyond happy will be doing business with them again thanks again !< /Text>

<text>When I called about my order, someone answered right away and said that it can take two to three weeks befor shipping out.  The item was listed in stock at the time and they said that they try to keep it as accurate as possible.  Not sure how they track inventory and link it to the site.  It has been over three weeks now and a nearly 48 hours since I sent an email inquiring about the status of my order, granted that they are probably busier than before.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt,  but I would appreciate a reply with an honest answer.  Give them some time.  I do hope to get an email reply by the beginning of the week.  The item is available on backorder so I am assuming that either they ran out before filling my order or that they noticed that the orderes placed depleted the inventory and they changed it online and are currently working on filling it.  Communication is key.  I can deal with waiting as long as the communication is open and truthful.  And no, I do not work for F&F.  I live in Illinois thank you very little.  Be safe everyone and wash your hands.< /text>< Rating>

<Text>I ordered from this place 21 days prior to speaking with Chris Flores about my order. He first said it wasn’t in stock in one email. So I asked why it said in stock when I ordered it and he followed up with telling me the item was in stock and asked me if I knew how to read. Must be items are out of stock when Chris Flores can’t do his job properly and in a timely manner, and in stock when he wants to keep the money, hopefully I actually get my refund<//Text>< Pictures>

Do Not do business with f&f. I ordered a kit on April 15th it said 17 day shipping delay which i was ok with. On may 15th i contacted him and said it would be soon. well i ordered one from 80p on may 15th and it arrived on Sat before i got a refund taking 10%.from f&f. I never saw this especially for something he admits not having stock but continues to take peoples money for the products without a idea of when they will ship.<//Text>

<review>Ordered on March 21 2020. This company does not care about the customer. They hold your money hostage won't ship for weeks and wont let you cancel your order through the website. You have to call or email. I've called 30 times no answer. So I guess they work in the store with orders when they want to. They also charge a 10% cancellation fee.< /review>< Rate>

<time>1591784363548<//time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!

UPDATE-JUNE 4TH:
today i received an email alert showing a full refund. Also got an auto receipt wmail stating the same. It hasnt been posted to my account, and hesitant waiting. Hoping this ordeal is resolved quickly and hopen for all others to have the same reault as me.

Trust me contact ur bank asap and dispute charges. Now in my emails to chris i was nice, friendly but steern in what i wanted(refunded in full) always thought being nice, and courteous got you further even if you being screwd.

UPDATE- JUNE 10TH:
finally have a full refund posted to my account.

UPDATE-JUNE 3RD: 1 MONTH WAIT...
chris is replying to emails about every 5 days...ive askd multiple times about when ill get my item. Told not instock and going down the orders in order they were placed. Got that same response 3 times now. Last 2 emails i have said i would just like a my order canceled. Last response from them was..well there will be some fees taken if we cancel  the order best u keep it. I said no i want a refund in full. Waiting for a reply..... (ive already filled with my bank for a reversal about 10 days ago) so ball is in f&f firearm(chris flores) court

ORIGNAL ORDER PROBLEM-  The items instock online but thats a lie...you will NEVER get what you paid for..either missing items or nothing at all! Try to email them, ull get an auto response, and never hear back. Try to call, go to answering machi e that says we wo t pick up the phone. This is 10000% scam. Worse business deals ive ever dealt with. Please before u order i hope you aee these review!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
for right now they get a 3 star. I was snappy to find a 80 percent glock for nearly $400 flat! I found a G26 build that I had seemingly ordered until I noticed I placed a order for the g19. I tried calling multiple times to get my order item swapped and changed before they began to ship my kit. No success on the phone and I’ve called 15 time minimum. I talked to a fellow through email about getting my g19 swapped for the g26 since that is what I wanted. Someone on the email asked me for my order number and what color glock I want. I have them all the information needed and it had been 2 weeks and email back and I’ve asked multiple times was the order corrected to I can be at ease... today I got back in touch through email and a fellow named Chris said they aren’t answering the phones right now to focus on order quality. The more and more I wait on the glock and the harder it is to get in contact the more and more I think I’ve been scammed. I doit it tho I will update you all, my kit should be here in a week at max if they are on tim.<//review>

It has been 104 days since I have placed my order and have had no contact from the company. I was even in the area and knocked on their door and called with no response. Emails have gone unanswered and attempts to dispute the charges through my bank have failed. Hoping this would spark a response since nothing else seems to work. They dont seem to have any interest what so ever in customer service.</review>

<Text>Knowing my order would take a couples weeks to process. Key word process. I emailed them couple days later and received no update so the same day I emailed for a refund. The day I asked for a refund my order is processed out of the blue. Then hours later Chris Flores sends me an emailing saying “Done”. I’ve read terms and conditions and said a 10% cancellation will be charged if cancellation is done when item is shipped or after business hours. So magically out of all the orders that supposedly take weeks to process mine does so I can be charged 10% fee. YOU GUYS DONT EVEN HAVE AN EMAIL TO CONTACT YOU GUYS ONLINE. It just shows a gun image.<//Text>< Pictures>

I ordered march 23 told me 14 days delivery weekends not included then he said 21 days until I get my order. so 21 days came Chris said shipping is taking time and still nothing so I said I can pick them up curb side he said no due to safety concerns. a few days later I asked again if I can pick them up and he said that they are on backorder like why would you give me delivery dates then and tell me that he has delayed shipping due to lots of orders? I told Chris I wanted a refund after a month of waiting he said he would have to charge me 10% for something he never had!! I contacted my bank and they reported him as fraud and got all my money back.< /text>

Ordered my g27 kit about a month ago haven't received anything not even an update so I emailed them a few times till they responded just to tell me the obvious that my order was delayed but yet never gave me a time frame of when my product would even ship anyone that reads this do yourself a favor and buy your kits somewhere else unless you want to have your money taken the same day and have them act so unprofessional as if you where begging for something free< /Text>

This Jack in the box off Broadway is clean inside and the staff here are quick and efficient. Jumbo Jack combo and two tacos was my order at the counter, the food was well made and fresh and served hot. Wait time was less than ten minutes and just a short trip and you are back on the 101 freeway. I will frequent this restaurant when in Santa Maria.<//Review>

Gross and barley warm food. I ordered the two tacos. I ate one and a half. Here are two taco photos. Cheese isn't even warm or melted. I threw the rest in the trash. Waste of money!<//text>

This location is right in the perfect location to get a lot of business.  It is dead center of town.  Not only that...It is caddy-corner from the main high school and across from The very popular Historic Santa Maria Inn too.  Now as far as rating, I give it a 4 stars.  I have always received decent customer service from the employees, and they seem to do all right at getting my order right and complete as far as I can recall.  I would definitely feel comfortable recommending this place as a good place to eat at.< /Review>

I see a lot of people like to complain for the most simple stuff here.

My experience here has been fair, always get the food hot and ready to eat so no complains. I always try to understand the employees when they have a huge line of cars waiting so I'm not picky with the time I spend waiting.

Yo those munchie meals be FIRE 🔥 tho. Keep it up... can't beat the price neither.</Text>

This old school jack in the box holds a place in my heart. Actually had good service here after not visiting for 20 years.  Its actually the least packed jacks in town after midnight. Main street and south Broadway are ridiculous after midnight. Mainly because Santa maria closes down at 10pm and there are zero options available to 100k+ residents.</review>

I ordered 2 regular taco. They had 4 very small pcs of lettuce and it was cold. I  will never go again there. In Bakersfield they put fresh lettuce its great , and they are are nice and warm,  but here its cheap, and the workers attitude is,  I don't care I am here. I will drive back to Bakersfield to get that Jack in the Box Taco because I love them. But never will I come and eat at one here in Santa Maria. And I live here.< /review>

The bathroom needs a little more maintenance, and depending on the day you go, the customer service isn't too good. Apart from these small problems that can be easily fixed with a meeting between the workers, it is a decent place to go.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>I love jack in the box and this is my worst experience . even though it was not very busy at the time of my visit the wait was long which i dont mind when the wait is for nice hot fresh food.. However. Both my jr jacks were made with burnt outdated meat and my fries were cold and hinted of fish flavor.. Wrong fryer guys.. Also they did not mention when customers were ordering that they were out of pickles even when the man behind me asked for extra he was not informed untill he complained about his burgers coming with none at all.. Get it together over there folks.thank you< /review><Gmap_id>0x80ec6c827f8f90c7:0x3b26347a7867720c< /Gmap_id><UserId.>112533804148402557471<//UserId.>< Rating>

This Jack in the Box is one of the first to open up here in my town years ago...im an "82" baby. Now this establishment hasnt changed much in its upgrading looks. And still looks Great and keeps providing Great service. One thing i would like to say WHEN Santa Maria High School is IN Season. I would try and avoid this place Monday thru Friday at lunch time... It gets tooken over by hungary kids lol our future.</text>

Bad place allways allways messed up the order all the time, this time didnt even bothered to warm up the chicken from the wrong order they did, this place is getting just worst and they never have a friendly face, I allways asked myself why do they work in this type of environment if they know there going to work around people.<//Review>

<Review>For fast food Jack in the box is okay however this particular Jack in the box in Santa Maria was very very slow it took 35 minutes from ordering to getting our food the food was cold the lady at the window was very nice an apologetic this could be the case for bad management.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I LOVE  Jack in the box,   but ill never come to this place again, its got food positing written all over it!< /text>< Pictures>
