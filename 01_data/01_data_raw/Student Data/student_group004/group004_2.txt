Very nice ladies! They are gentle with your nails and the hand drawn designs are to die for. If you go in the morning, its very peaceful and you get all the attention. They're very clean, all areas are sanitized each hour or as needed. Mask required for service! I love them and will be back again and again.< /text>

< review>
I called at exactly 9 a.m. when the shop opened to make an appointment. I asked for the best time  as I had multiple people in my party. I was given a time and showed on time for the appointment. Waited thirty minutes before they started one person in the party. Overall it was a three hour ordeal. Helen was very nice and there is a sweet elderly lady who was exceptionally nice however, the manager or owner was the complete opposite. She was rude and curt. When asked about an additional.50 charge she rudely answered saying it was a fee for using a card. Generally information offered and not solicited after it has been charged. Overall, I do NOT recommend this shop unless you want to wait for an extensive period of time and be ridiculously mistreated. Two stars is a little generous considering the experience.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This was one of the worst experiences at a nail salon. $28 for a gel manicure. The lady was nice but horrible at her job. During my my manicure she would like use her nail around my nail skin to smooth it out or get rid of the extra nail polish not on my nail. It was excessive and annoying. Towards the end of my appt she ask very nice huh and I was like umm no my nails were not smooth but like clunky looking. She did smooth them out at the end but they are not the best. My friend hated her experience too. Her nail tech got nail polish all over her hands?! How lol we Will not be back.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80d953c0d67f5785:0x9018208e3e55bf7b<//GmapID></record>

Absolute best nail salon in San Diego! The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I have been a loyal customer for many years and I would not go anywhere else. Ann is the BEST nail artist! She does an excellent job on my nails each time. Ann even came in on her vacation to do my wedding nails... just shows how much she cares about her clients. I would recommend her to everyone!</review>

I came here a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to nails and when it comes to customer service.

First I called the place to check their hours because it was Labor Day holiday, the lady who answered the phone was very polite and said they had time to do my nails. When I arrived (1.5 hours before closing) they were very friend, I asked to have gel polish and a pedicure. It crossed my mind that the service may be rushed because it was close to closing time, thankfully that was not the case. I had the gel polish on my nails, perfectly applied. I check corners, bubbles etc. It was great. My pedicure was great, they did a great job filing, scrubbing and all that good stuff. To top it off, I had a decent massage! Because I received such great service I decided to ask if they could wax my eyebrows, they were happy to do it! At this point we were almost at closing hours, Lilly waxed my eyebrows and also did a great job. Overall- great experience, great service. I WILL be back and I do recommend. Keep in mind that I am very selective as I mentioned but I always have realistic expectations. :)</text>

<Review>I was here on Christmas Eve. I wanted to wait before writing any kind of review of the place. When I got there, I didn't have to wait. Which was nice. But they rushed me into my chair without asking what style/color I wanted. Everywhere else I have gone will have some kind of soap or rinse added to the water for even the most basic spa pedicure. They added nothing. Just tepid water. They didn't show me a "menu" of the types of pedicure I wanted. But they did ask me after seeing all the dead skin and callouses on my feet if I wanted extras. After prepping my nails, that's when they asked me about color. The one doing my hands cut me a little while doing my cuties, only put 2 coats of a "glitter shade" with no solid color underneath to make the glitter pop. And because she didn't cure the gel right, less than a week later, the color is already chipped or peeled off.  My feet are not as smooth as I liked either. I did tip so I spent $70 for the whole thing. I am never coming here again.</Review><response>None<//response><Rate>1</Rate><userid>109434677298801324621< /userid></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
My boyfriend & I wanted to go get our FEET done. Reading couple reviews before hand, made me second guess trying this place out.
However I used to come to this place waaaay when I was younger, under different management. & decided to go back to see for myself.
We walked in, & we were greeted right away.
It wasnt an upclose interaction but they acknowledged us & was able to take us right away being as Walk-Ins.
As I am sitting in the pedicure massage chairs. This place looks pretty clean, the furniture was comfortable, looked in good shape, no rips and had decent prices for the services provided.
The ladies noticed I am pregnant so I could not enjoy the massage chair. They were gentle with me during the hand massages throughtout my session to not hit a nerve that could affect my pregnancy.  But my boyfriend was able to experience allll the perks that came along with the service we decided on.
Ofcourse he didnt get any color. But him walking on his feet 10 hours, 5 days out of the week. This service did him justice. Feels like a brand new foot! I went for the classic french white tips. I have no cuts. No scratches. No chips. My nails are not too short. I am quite satisfied with my service. She really did a good job, we would definitely go back there.<//Review>

<Date>1520103080825</Date><rating>1<//rating><Review>I came in for a full set and pedicure. I was seated right away no wait time yet I still waited for them to start with my nails for a very long time. The lady who did my full set looked very distracted and unorganized kept getting up in between doing my nails. I asked for Coffin shaped nails and she left my nails uneven (one side sharp, one side round) and crooked. To top it off she cut me a few times with the electric file and still left my nails unsmooth. The over all time I spent was 2.5 hrs, don't go there if your time is limited. Over priced for the services that you get. Not worth your time or money! Definitely not returning and DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!< /Review>< Pics>

Not enough service for the amount of people waiting. It's like a grocery store, 10 tables to two services. More than half the staff doesn't speak or understand a lick of English which makes things frustrating. None of them seem to care about your wants or needs. Between the wait time and a simple fill, I spent 2 and half hours in just one visit. Sorry MiMi,  gonna have to rate your salon 2 stars.< /text>

I went today for a full set and ended with a gel french manicure. My nail were really short so not much to paint. The white part didnt cover the whole tip, was uneven. The surprise was went i got charged 29 dollars + tip for such a Messy job. Usually I pay less for acrilic white tip nails, the full set plus gel, and look much better. I felt rippen of.</Review>

Worst manicure and pedicure !!. Beware very long review long story short was over charged and got run around when I confronted them about charge. Keep a close eye if you pay with credit card. I had a guy tech and he kept pushing for me to "get gel polish " after saying no for the 3rd time he started to mimick me by saying no. By the time he finished my nails he told me to sit by the drying station I noticed that my nails where bubbling so I talked to the receptionist and she said to talk to "him". He came And pretend to act surprise. He said he would fix but that i would have to wait. So 3 min later he takes some acetone and rubbs the clear coat off with his finger. He proceeds to apply a thicker cost of polish plus clear coat and walks me to drying station as to make sure I didn't do whatever I did to cause the nail polish to bubble. So as my nails are drying they start to bubble AGAIN I inform him and he comes and looks at my nails and pretends that only one has bubbles so I correct him and tell him that no that all of them are bubbling. Again he tells me that I have to wait for 5 min so this time he roughly unpolished my nails and actually took his time and polished my nail correctly. By the time my nails dried I was happy finally no bubbles!  Here comes the real shocker I went on Saturday so on Monday I am looking over my bank account and noticed that I have a  charge of $109.00 from Phantastic Nails!  So I went to nail shop asking to speak to a manager or person in charge I was told to take a seat and wait for 10 min. I told her that I was not going to wait for 10 min that if there was someone in charge or not. She stopped what she was doing and asked what the problem was. I told her of the charge and she said that it was a mistake that the guy had charge my account by mistake........ So I lost my cool and got a bit loud. She said plead wait let me get my manager on the phone. She called some one and spoke in her native tongue then handed me the phone. So this lady said it was a mistake and that they refunded my money back I told her that one as not seeing any refund and that if it was a mistake why was I not informed. Again I was told to wait that she was going to call the guy in charge of their credit card machine. So this guy starts telling me that the refund was issued to give it 3 days and I would see the refund. If not to call him and that " we could work something out". So I'm so done by this point I tell him that I will be contacting my bank to inform of the fraudulent charge. He said that I could do that but that they had paper work and that they would re charge my credit card. So I asked what paperwork you have no signature on receipt for 109.00 dollar charge. I never authorized that charge. We be talking to my bank tomorrow as it was closed by the time I left nail shop.< /text>

Worst place to get your nails done. I went to get a  pedicure and gel manicure done for my birthday and I spent 2 hours just to get that done. They attended other people and left me waiting for some time.</review>

Don't know what the person before me is saying, this is a great place! I started by making  2:30 appointment with my mom and when I walked in it looked very clean and very professionail (lol get it). I sat down and picked my color and waited around a half hour til I got seated for my pedicure. The owner had recently just had a cute little baby boy 4 months ago, so some people really need to cut her some slack. The ladies were very attentive and tried making sure everyone was happy. They were one of the few nail salons open on labor day so it was packed, and there were only 5 of them. Uptight middle aged moms who thought they're so important and need to be sat down right away were causing some problems. They're very friendly, they do a great job, and my nails look amazing! Don't listen to that review from before, come here or regret everything tbh<//Text>

It was uncomfortable, the lady was doing my nails while the husband(works there)was hovering over her the entire time. She rushed doing my nails and they didn't look very good for the price i paid. My nails started to lift after the 2nd day. So i wasnt very happy.</text>

I came in to try n get my nails done
They wanted to force me to only do a refill and didn’t want to make them any shorter or a different color
What a pathetic place to go to if they want to do what they want not what the customer wants< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The girls do not speak with the clients, they are only speaking among themselves in another language and I am not against that but you ask them something and they do not answer you and they also hurt me when I was tying my nails and they only say it's okay nothing happened and one Nail fell silent the next day of service

(Original)
Las muchachas no hablan con los clientes solo están hablando entre ellas mismas en otro idioma y no estoy en contra de eso pero les preguntas algo y no te contestan y también me lastimaron al estar ligando las uñas y solo dicen está bien no paso nada y una uña se me callo al siguiente día de servicio<//text>

Very nice ladies! They are gentle with your nails and the hand drawn designs are to die for. If you go in the morning, its very peaceful and you get all the attention. They're very clean, all areas are sanitized each hour or as needed. Mask required for service! I love them and will be back again and again.</text>

<Review>I called at exactly 9 a.m. when the shop opened to make an appointment. I asked for the best time  as I had multiple people in my party. I was given a time and showed on time for the appointment. Waited thirty minutes before they started one person in the party. Overall it was a three hour ordeal. Helen was very nice and there is a sweet elderly lady who was exceptionally nice however, the manager or owner was the complete opposite. She was rude and curt. When asked about an additional.50 charge she rudely answered saying it was a fee for using a card. Generally information offered and not solicited after it has been charged. Overall, I do NOT recommend this shop unless you want to wait for an extensive period of time and be ridiculously mistreated. Two stars is a little generous considering the experience.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmap_id>

This was one of the worst experiences at a nail salon. $28 for a gel manicure. The lady was nice but horrible at her job. During my my manicure she would like use her nail around my nail skin to smooth it out or get rid of the extra nail polish not on my nail. It was excessive and annoying. Towards the end of my appt she ask very nice huh and I was like umm no my nails were not smooth but like clunky looking. She did smooth them out at the end but they are not the best. My friend hated her experience too. Her nail tech got nail polish all over her hands?! How lol we Will not be back.<//text>

I went in today for a manicure with my gf all was good until she clipped to much of my skin on my nail and made me bleed and she left some hangnails still there on top of that with my gf they messed up her nails the first time but making them really un Even we asked them to make it even and they proceeded to re paint her red and French tip nails with black my recommendation would be very thro with them so they understand u and actually get it right the first time</Text>

I came here a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to nails and when it comes to customer service.

First I called the place to check their hours because it was Labor Day holiday, the lady who answered the phone was very polite and said they had time to do my nails. When I arrived (1.5 hours before closing) they were very friend, I asked to have gel polish and a pedicure. It crossed my mind that the service may be rushed because it was close to closing time, thankfully that was not the case. I had the gel polish on my nails, perfectly applied. I check corners, bubbles etc. It was great. My pedicure was great, they did a great job filing, scrubbing and all that good stuff. To top it off, I had a decent massage! Because I received such great service I decided to ask if they could wax my eyebrows, they were happy to do it! At this point we were almost at closing hours, Lilly waxed my eyebrows and also did a great job. Overall- great experience, great service. I WILL be back and I do recommend. Keep in mind that I am very selective as I mentioned but I always have realistic expectations. :)<//Text>

<Text>I was here on Christmas Eve. I wanted to wait before writing any kind of review of the place. When I got there, I didn't have to wait. Which was nice. But they rushed me into my chair without asking what style/color I wanted. Everywhere else I have gone will have some kind of soap or rinse added to the water for even the most basic spa pedicure. They added nothing. Just tepid water. They didn't show me a "menu" of the types of pedicure I wanted. But they did ask me after seeing all the dead skin and callouses on my feet if I wanted extras. After prepping my nails, that's when they asked me about color. The one doing my hands cut me a little while doing my cuties, only put 2 coats of a "glitter shade" with no solid color underneath to make the glitter pop. And because she didn't cure the gel right, less than a week later, the color is already chipped or peeled off.  My feet are not as smooth as I liked either. I did tip so I spent $70 for the whole thing. I am never coming here again.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

My boyfriend & I wanted to go get our FEET done. Reading couple reviews before hand, made me second guess trying this place out.
However I used to come to this place waaaay when I was younger, under different management. & decided to go back to see for myself.
We walked in, & we were greeted right away.
It wasnt an upclose interaction but they acknowledged us & was able to take us right away being as Walk-Ins.
As I am sitting in the pedicure massage chairs. This place looks pretty clean, the furniture was comfortable, looked in good shape, no rips and had decent prices for the services provided.
The ladies noticed I am pregnant so I could not enjoy the massage chair. They were gentle with me during the hand massages throughtout my session to not hit a nerve that could affect my pregnancy.  But my boyfriend was able to experience allll the perks that came along with the service we decided on.
Ofcourse he didnt get any color. But him walking on his feet 10 hours, 5 days out of the week. This service did him justice. Feels like a brand new foot! I went for the classic french white tips. I have no cuts. No scratches. No chips. My nails are not too short. I am quite satisfied with my service. She really did a good job, we would definitely go back there.<//Text>

<Text>I came in for a full set and pedicure. I was seated right away no wait time yet I still waited for them to start with my nails for a very long time. The lady who did my full set looked very distracted and unorganized kept getting up in between doing my nails. I asked for Coffin shaped nails and she left my nails uneven (one side sharp, one side round) and crooked. To top it off she cut me a few times with the electric file and still left my nails unsmooth. The over all time I spent was 2.5 hrs, don't go there if your time is limited. Over priced for the services that you get. Not worth your time or money! Definitely not returning and DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!</Text>< Pictures>

More than half the staff doesn't speak or understand a lick of English which makes things frustrating. None of them seem to care about your wants or needs. Between the wait time and a simple fill, I spent 2 and half hours in just one visit. Sorry MiMi,  gonna have to rate your salon 2 stars.< /Review><pics>None</pics></record>

I went today for a full set and ended with a gel french manicure. My nail were really short so not much to paint. The white part didnt cover the whole tip, was uneven. The surprise was went i got charged 29 dollars + tip for such a Messy job. Usually I pay less for acrilic white tip nails, the full set plus gel, and look much better. I felt rippen of.</Text>

<username>Maci Guardado</username><user_id>109849738674390647988< /user_id><text>Worst manicure and pedicure !!. Beware very long review long story short was over charged and got run around when I confronted them about charge. Keep a close eye if you pay with credit card. I had a guy tech and he kept pushing for me to "get gel polish " after saying no for the 3rd time he started to mimick me by saying no. By the time he finished my nails he told me to sit by the drying station I noticed that my nails where bubbling so I talked to the receptionist and she said to talk to "him". He came And pretend to act surprise. He said he would fix but that i would have to wait. So 3 min later he takes some acetone and rubbs the clear coat off with his finger. He proceeds to apply a thicker cost of polish plus clear coat and walks me to drying station as to make sure I didn't do whatever I did to cause the nail polish to bubble. So as my nails are drying they start to bubble AGAIN I inform him and he comes and looks at my nails and pretends that only one has bubbles so I correct him and tell him that no that all of them are bubbling. Again he tells me that I have to wait for 5 min so this time he roughly unpolished my nails and actually took his time and polished my nail correctly. By the time my nails dried I was happy finally no bubbles!  Here comes the real shocker I went on Saturday so on Monday I am looking over my bank account and noticed that I have a  charge of $109.00 from Phantastic Nails!  So I went to nail shop asking to speak to a manager or person in charge I was told to take a seat and wait for 10 min. I told her that I was not going to wait for 10 min that if there was someone in charge or not. She stopped what she was doing and asked what the problem was. I told her of the charge and she said that it was a mistake that the guy had charge my account by mistake........ So I lost my cool and got a bit loud. She said plead wait let me get my manager on the phone. She called some one and spoke in her native tongue then handed me the phone. So this lady said it was a mistake and that they refunded my money back I told her that one as not seeing any refund and that if it was a mistake why was I not informed. Again I was told to wait that she was going to call the guy in charge of their credit card machine. So this guy starts telling me that the refund was issued to give it 3 days and I would see the refund. If not to call him and that " we could work something out". So I'm so done by this point I tell him that I will be contacting my bank to inform of the fraudulent charge. He said that I could do that but that they had paper work and that they would re charge my credit card. So I asked what paperwork you have no signature on receipt for 109.00 dollar charge. I never authorized that charge. We be talking to my bank tomorrow as it was closed by the time I left nail shop.</text></record></dataset><record>

I started by making  2:30 appointment with my mom and when I walked in it looked very clean and very professionail (lol get it). I sat down and picked my color and waited around a half hour til I got seated for my pedicure. The owner had recently just had a cute little baby boy 4 months ago, so some people really need to cut her some slack. The ladies were very attentive and tried making sure everyone was happy. They were one of the few nail salons open on labor day so it was packed, and there were only 5 of them. Uptight middle aged moms who thought they're so important and need to be sat down right away were causing some problems. They're very friendly, they do a great job, and my nails look amazing! Don't listen to that review from before, come here or regret everything tbh< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>It was uncomfortable, the lady was doing my nails while the husband(works there)was hovering over her the entire time. She rushed doing my nails and they didn't look very good for the price i paid. My nails started to lift after the 2nd day. So i wasnt very happy.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The girls do not speak with the clients, they are only speaking among themselves in another language and I am not against that but you ask them something and they do not answer you and they also hurt me when I was tying my nails and they only say it's okay nothing happened and one Nail fell silent the next day of service

(Original)
Las muchachas no hablan con los clientes solo están hablando entre ellas mismas en otro idioma y no estoy en contra de eso pero les preguntas algo y no te contestan y también me lastimaron al estar ligando las uñas y solo dicen está bien no paso nada y una uña se me callo al siguiente día de servicio</Review>

Pollo Loco is delicious.  We go here probably once every 2 weeks. We always get a 16 piece family meal because there are 5 of us (2 adults 3 children). The 16 pieces of chicken, 3 large sides, tortillas and salsa are just right. However, I wish the side salad was filled up more, it always comes half way filled. So getting a large family meal, paying a good price and then getting a extra small salad is sad. The price can be up there, so I go when there are specials on the rewards app or even with coupons that come thru the mail.< /text>

<Review>Always buy the pollo bowl. It comes with rice, beans and chicken.  A delicious
meal for $5. This bowl is very filling.
Love this meal!</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I've ordered food from this place at least 6 times through Postmates because of their low prices. The food is really filling. I should really try actually going into the place sometime. I want to try other Mexican food places but this one just keeps bringing me back. I always get the veggie burrito since its huge and only like 5 bucks. Good stuff. thanks:)<//Text>< pics>

I went thru the drive thru last night around 930 and asked for a chicken avocado with NO PICO DE GALLO AND NO CREAM CILANTRO. I go home another 30 mins away to end up with pico de Gallo and creamy cilantro. It’s not the first time & to top it off they don’t even answer the phone !!!!< /text>

It was pretty good! Fast, tastey, not over-priced, and hot.  Service was moderately friendly but got my order right and fast, so no problems.  A very friendly cleanup worker guy asked if I needed anything repeatedly, he was sweet.  Overall, a good experience.< /text>

If you need your protein fix on the fly this is your best choice. They have a drive through, just be careful their entrance is a little narrow. The food is delicious though, they're very consistent with the recipe..</text>

I used to love Pollo Loco but the quality just wasn't there. The salsa was not fresh and lacked flavor. The chicken had good flavor but not good enough.< /Text>

<review>I decided to go inside, instead of my usual trip to the drive thru. There was no one at the counter and even after an employee shouted that there was someone waiting, no one came. All the girls behind the line seemed distracted and disinterested. Few minutes later an obviously annoyed/upset girl came to help me and the 3 others that were waiting for a fork, some dressing and a tostada without black lettuce. I got a chicken avocado quesadilla with no pico. I watched them put pico on it and had to holler that I didn't want pico. So they proceeded to pick off the pico. What?! Then decided to throw the whole thing away and start over. Okay, that's good. Right? I get the quesadilla and open it up before I leave. It's supposed to be grilled in order for the tortilla to stick together. It was hardly grilled, not stuck together and trying to pick it up, it opens up like a taco bowl that's floppy & not crisp. Really!? Went back to the counter, asked them how someone is supposed to eat this? They didn't seem to know how to eat it either and made me another one. Then tried to put pico on that one as well. Really!? Finally I got my correct order, thanked them, and hurried out the door to get away from that sh*t show. Quesadilla turned out to be good. Lol<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< user>

Usually chicken is overcooked and dry and sometimes even burned. I have no top teeth... When I get it home like this, I can't eat it, the dog ends up getting most of it. It's about 50% of the time... So 3 stars.<//Text>

<username>Celia Chavez<//username><date>1496734481097< /date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Had not visited this particular establishment in a year because the food was served cold.  This was unacceptable.  I'll bet you none of the employees gobble their food cold.  So, thought on giving it a second chance see if anything had changed !

A leopard doesn't change its spots.  Absolutely not.  Bought 10 tacos al carbon.  The food disgustingly cold and was only given 3 small tomato salsas.

If I wanted cold food I would had bought a sandwich.  This Place is Disgusting and employees should go work elsewhere if they have any talent at all.  Why bother giving it a chance at all. I'm out $18.00

I urge all people to not waste your money.  Not even safe for canines.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>(Translated by Google) Why do not they give salsa when it's ordered in the Drive Thru? That Crystal girl twisted my mouth when I asked. She said that she did not have to if she wanted to grab her from the dining room there if there was one. That is not the best service on your part. As a Mexican and eating without sauce is something unusual.

(Original)
Porque no dan salsa cuando se ordena en el Drive Thru? Esa chica Crystal me torcio la boca cuando pregunte. Dijo que no habia que si quería la agarrara del comedor ahí si habia. Ese no es el mejor servicio por su parte. Como Mexicana y comer sin salsa es algo inusual.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>This is a fun ride that compared to others, is fairly short in overall duration. This does make the line move quickly, however be aware that the ride itself wraps up quickly. The jellyfish seat two, so if you're in a party of three you'll be separated. The ride lifts you up to a solid height, providing beautiful views of California Adventure, then it fairly slowly lowers you a bit, raises you back up, rinse and repeat before bringing it back down to the ground. If heights bother you - probably not the ride you want to try.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Fun ride to go on at least once for the nice view. I was frustrated because they consistently had only one of the two towers operating during busy park days. This made the wait longer than it had to be.<//Text>

About as exciting as riding an elevator. My six year old commented that this was too short or a ride and too slow. Perhaps a minor distraction for really little ones, but other than that stay away.< /Text>

this attraction has a 40" height requirement, which is the same as tower of terror, radiator springs racers, and soarin'. all much better options of you're tall enough to ride them. on the plus side, at least you get good views of disneyland when this ride goes up< /text>

<Text>If you are 5 or 55, Jumpin' Jellyfish is a quick and fun ride. It goes just high enough to give you a view of DCA, but not so high and fast that it's a thrill ride (although it scares the bejeebus out of my wife). Line is usually pretty quick so it's not a huge time investment to go on this charming little ride.<//Text>< Resp>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The height difference is larger than that of Japan, and it is more fun because it is outdoors.

They have the best banana pudding in the world! I don't really like pudding, but the moment I tasted their banana pudding, I so love to eat one! It is far from our place but we make effort to drive to this place just to order some for to go and enjoy it at home. I'll try their cupcakes soon!<//text>

Vanessa made my daughter's snow white cake and it came out incredible! Not only great in design, but also super moist and delicious. Will definitely be ordering from her again, highly recommend.<//review>

My favorite bakery in Los Angeles. Sweet but not too sweet. The strawberry cake is a must try! The simplest is the best. The buns are all very nice. I like the one with mochi inside it and matcha powder outside.< /Text>

<review>Genuinely nice owners & very tasty pan dulce. Small & quaint panaderia in Boyle Heights. During the holidays the owner created a large bread cornucopia filled with fruit & cream that was worthy of a higher end bakery, but at a reasonable & fair price.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Such a nice woman, very well dressed and great presentation to the store. They accept Cash, Debit, and Credit. Sells Alkaline water as well at a higher price but you can taste the difference. Will definitely come back!(:< /review>

I needed some documents printed and my parents suggested I go here since they had a similar service done here. I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped into the store. The place is a great change of pace for the community. Clean, updated, organized. The lady at the counter is very well dressed and pleasant.

I was directed to a glass shop down the street to pick up my print job. I believe they're owned by the same people. The glass shop staff was pleasant as well.< /Text>

Excellent place, the lady that take care of the store is sweet and lovely , she helped me and even trusted on me in a difficult moment, I was having one of the worst days in my life , in a total strange area, not knowing no one, trying find a house to leave .... she trusted on me here machines wasn’t down and she couldn’t charges my credit card, and anyway she still sold me the water. Good heart, lovely and very pretty inside and outside, I pray everyday for your business became a success and you have in double all .

I don’t know her name but I call her “Thalia”

Thank you once again< /Text>

Reasonable prices. Big portions.  Sometimes you just want a little bit of Hawaiian food to comfort you while you can't travel anytime soon there!</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Ordered the 1. Spam & egg with rice & 2. Chicken katsu and teriyaki combo with rice. Their portion is huge so it’s def worth the money. I like that they kept the teriyaki sauce in a flask to made it warm. Overall yum food and will definitely go back. Also Sunday parking is free for the area.</Text><response>None< /response>< Date>

<Text>Pretty darn good. I am picky about my Hawaiian food, and for me what stood out here is the tonkatsu sauce was on point, which is usually lacking for me at these fast food Hawaiian joints. It wasnt quite the bulldog brand, but pretty close, especially if it was homemade.

We got the katsu plate, beef/Teri chicken/katsu plate, and musubi, all was pretty good, katsu wasn't as fresh and juicy as I would have liked, but it was good.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlOpCgI0cM290vYqLN2uMPG6Y0_mz30F-RFNfP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

Great Food. Very happy with the fast service and the great taste. A lot lighter than L&L. BBQ was so good, I didn't even need to put on any soy sauce or hot sauce.<//Text>

Service was great! Came in with a big group and were treated well. The food combo is very generous, you get plenty for its price. It was my first time trying Hawaiian BBQ and was very impressed. Would recommend to anyone that would like to try something new or different!</review>

Small local place that we found by walking down the street.  They cook the food when you order it.  They have delivery by some service as we saw several delivery people pick up.  The food was good, the portions large and everything tasted fresh.  I will return when in the area.<//text>

Good prices, good food. The selections here are great and the food is really good. They also give out a lot of food per plate which is always great. There are also condiments on the side like teriyaki sauce or katsu sauce. It's really good for take out. Although you can dine in, there are only a few seats.</Text>

The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  The salmon is my fave.  Chicken is great.  I always get my food to go as it's a small seating area and not super comfy.  I like that they're open 7 days a week!< /text>

The food quality (as far as tastes go) was OK, but the portion is HUGE for the price; they are generous with the meat. Not a lot of seating and generally not a good place to have a talk, but then it's meant to be a fast food or quick meal experience. The staff is friendly.</Text>

Place is not very big but comfortable. Metered street parking definitely enforced so bring some change!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

Similar menu, prices, and portions to L&L Hawaiian BBQ. Food tastes a little better than L&L, especially if you eat it in the restaurant instead of letting it get soggy in the takeout box. There is a good amount of dining space in the restaurant, but it does get crowded during lunch and dinner hours. One regular plate is enough for 2 people and they will gladly give you an extra plate for sharing.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Umm this place is not for the faint of appetite and those on a diet. The portions are generous and the food is great!! What a treat to eat crispy delicious katsu. I miss my Hawaiian food fix since leaving the Bay Area and was thrilled to find this place so close to work.
The prices are reasonable, and the service quick.
Highly recommend if you're in the area or you work near Grand Ave.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Excellent Hawaiian BBQ! The chicken Katsu was fantastic. Service was very fast and friendly. Lobby is pretty small, and seating is limited</Text>

Food had very generous portions and we're very reasonablely priced, and the place was quite clean. Service wasnt great, but that's not what you come here for. Overall, it was fast easy, and quite good, no complaints</review>

Pretty good Hawaiian spot.  It's super fast, you can just walk in and have your food within 5 min.
It has basically the same menu as Ono, but not quite as good in my opinion.  The sauces aren't as tasty and the katsu falls a little flat.  But the bbq chicken is solid as is the Mac and rice.  If your in ssf and want Hawaiian it's def worth it</text>

Ordering this for Lunch while at Peter Pan BMW in Burlingame. You really get a whole lot more in size portion and quality compared to some of the L&L locations in the area...

Their BBQ chicken is probably the heartiest meal entree I've ever tried other than Korean Style BBQ</Review>

This guys are the best, I even talk once with the owner and he is a very nice guy to talk with.
They have an extensive variety of products and the prices are very reasonable compared to other places.
I as landscaper love this place.< /Review>

They are SO FAST. I spoke to Val for 15 min., and my soil & mulch was delivered within an hour. She was very patient and knowledgeable. She took the time to confirm some raised garden math for me, answered my questions, etc. I was previously set on working with another company, but they failed to get my order on the delivery schedule (I was on a time crunch and needed to work around my work schedule so I planned to have it delivered on a specific day and they never put my order through). My entire experience with the other company was so unpleasant. They were condescending & rude. I decided to call SPV Soil and see if they could get me on their schedule right away & I'm so glad I did! Now my day off won't go to waste and I can actually get my transplants in the ground and growing!< /text>

< Review>
They sell mulch, compost, and wood chips at a very reasonable price.  You will need a pickup or trailer as everything is sold in bulk by the cubic yard.  My compact pickup holds 1 cubic yard.  Bring a tarp to keep the mulch from blowing away on your way home.  If you need a large amount, they will deliver for a fee.   They also take greenery from your yard, such as tree and bush trimmings.

The staff is very friendly and helpful and I always enjoy going there.  There is a milk dairy next door so you can take a minute to check out the cows.  BTW, they are closed Saturdays and Sundays.<//Review>

Organic, OMRI certified compost and soil with easy access, thorough spec documentation, and outstanding customer service. Priced very reasonably for their products. Probably impossible to find better value in the SW region.
The staff are a pleasure to do business with--professional and accommodating. They are able to serve any size farm, nursery, or garden center--small or large.

Very rude people with bad customer service.  I had another company delivered before and it was very easy.

Too expensive. Butter $20 for bucket fresco was $10. Paneer was expensive. No prices and when got to the counter I felt like over charged.</review>

Worst food. Ordered pakodas from here and there is nothing in it except a lot of oil and colour.
They are the worst pakodas one can ever get.< /text>

<userid>107476956965262392146<//userid><Text>Prices are way to high compare to other Indian grocery stores. Short guy in the front with turban overcharges. If something is being sold for $1.99 they will manually enter $2.00. If you complaint about it, their usual answer is $1.99 and $2.00 is same. If you do that to 100 customers daily you are scamming public for $30 every month. I am not trying to be cheap but every penny counts.

Kitchen: chef and kitchen staff preparing food without gloves and mask. A high risk place to catch CoVID and flu. Very crowded

Positives: owners have good nature and talk very politely. They have pretty much everything inside the store.</Text>< Time>

Oh the galore or variety of sweets, you won't know which to try first. Just be sure to check for any allergens like nuts, dairy etc.. the employees were nice, the customers were helpful in regards to anything we didn't know of.

< Review>
We had a overnight Stop in Fresno on our road trip. Found this place to be very authentic. If you really want to get the flavour of good north Indian food try out this place.

Please note that the it not a great place to sit down and have your lunch/dinner. Takeaway is a much option.< /Review>

<text>I have been ordering from this place for a couple months now and the last three times I ordered from here they have given me old spoiled food and this time I received stale and old Roti (Tortillas bread). This is very unprofessional and unacceptable from a restaurant.</text>< Time>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>I just feel writing a lot so please dont mind me . So here my honest feelings about this place. Here I go.
Well, the food they serve according to my experience, is fresh. It's not close to how the Indian fast food taste like in india, but it's not that far off too. They've variety of punjabi culture related stuff and the things that often punjabis use in daily life back in India.
Definitely recommendable.
But the most bad thing about this place is they serve so unprofessionally, they treat customers like the Indian grocery store employees treat their customers in India, like they don't care. You can feel the contrast between these kind of restaurants and other American restaurants, and I'm talking about respect, care for their customers

Best Indian store in terms of prices and selection. I usually go to the stores in Bakersfield but whenever I'm in Fresno, I'll go out of my way to shop here. Haven't tried the food, but I've heard it's pretty good. But as far as your Indian grocery shopping, this place is by far way superior than their competitors. Keep up the good work guys...</text>

Shan-e- Punjab is an awesome place. It's basically an Indian grocery store that has a restaurant inside. The grocery store has all the normal amenities like bulk grains and spices. The restaurant seating area is not large, but it's big enough and kind of secluded from the groceries if you want to stop in for a bite.
What makes this place is the food in the restaurant. The quality is very high and the traffic proves it. It gets very busy towards dinner time with both dine in and take out. In fact, quality is so high on the priority list that there are dishes they flat out won't make if they can't get a batch of quality spices in to make it.
From what I understand, Shan-e- actually supplies allot of the local Indian restaurants with product for their kitchens. So if you want it straight from the supplier from amazing chefs then check this place out. You won't be disappointed!</Review>

<text>I was there last Saturday for some Indian groceries. During the time when people are price gouging and trying to sell salt at 2.99  the store owner was giving dozen eggs free to every client irrespective of how much they bought. True to the name of the store

My third experience is not good at all I have ordered aloo tikka chat there were literally two flies in it immediately I called them they did not bother and very casually asked now what can we do, next time you come will make you another one but that doesn't make sense.
Do check twice before you open any of the food package from them.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Food is good and Punjabi. Stopped there while coming from Kings canyon.. The paratha was great, paneer naan and goat curry was good . Goat biriyani was no way a proper biriyani although if you consider it as curry and rice mixed it tasted good. Biriyani can definitely be improved. Nice place overall..</Text><gmap_id>0x80946601a48aeb8f:0x82fc03b4b33ad19c<//gmap_id><Name>sayon sur</Name></record>

I lost my BMW key three months ago and three days ago I got a ticket to move my car out of the road because it’s been there for too long. I called low key locksmith this morning and they responded quickly and efficiently. They showed up at my house and they re-programmed and cut a new key for me within 20 minutes. Now I can move my car and not get it towed. Thank you low key locksmith.< /Text>

Low Key Locksmith was reasonably priced (about a 1/3 of what the dealership quoted us to get a replacement car key made and programmed).  Zaid was extremely professional, polite and courteous.  I would strongly recommend Low Key Locksmith and Zaid for your mobile locksmith needs.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>I had called 3 other locksmiths, all of them had promised getting me into my car none of them showed, I had learned here that it being a 2020 Toyota camry had posed a problem as most other did not have current inventory, they had it quoted a 30 min arrival time and made it in 20.

Best deal around! $120.00 even for a chipped key. He gave me an extra key that just opens the door as well too!!  Was a lottle bit longer than he said but he sent a text letting me know which wasn't an issue. Made it on time and we ran into a little issue but with the help of my phone and my boyfriend finding the fuse box for the dude they were able to program the key correctly . i gave him the money upfront and even waited inside til he finished and he was hinest and didnt take off with my money. Overall 5 star review< /Text>

<Text>I first contacted another locksmith that was closer to my location after waiting 45 minutes with no call back I contacted Low key he arrived in 15 minutes an in a total of 30 minutes I was in my truck and gone.  prompt, courteous and professional. as an ex-Army Ranger I say put this company on  "POINT"  I hope that I don't have to use you again for a lockout, but if I do you get the CALL

<Review>Awesome experience. He came to me at night y’all! I had lost my keys and needed my car for work he said “I’ll be there in 30minutes.” He got there quick gave me my options and honestly gave me a great deal for a new key set. I’m super grateful. Not to mention he accepted cash and card which is always convenient!</Review>< Pictures>

My car and keys had been stolen from my job. It was found and I called Low Key locksmith. He gave me a great price and was there very quickly. I was also made aware of what the full price would be before my service was given. He was friendly and professional and the service was quick. I expressed my worry that the thief had my original car keys and he deleted the old one from my cars system. He also accepted the mixture of cash and card I had on me as payment. Would recommend to anyone.< /Text>

Instead of price gouging us for a late night call, we were charged a more than reasonable fee. In fact,we paid less than what most locksmiths would charge during normal business hours. If you’re looking for a professional, honest and trustworthy locksmith, with super-competitive pricing, Low Key is the place to call.<//Review>< user>

<Review>Excellent service.  I needed new locks installed in my house, Zaid picked up the phone right away, showed up on time and did a great job at a very reasonable price.  I would use Low Key service again when I need it and recommend them to my friends.<//Review>< pictures>

Low Key is the Best!! I called them to get my keys out of my truck and they were there in 12 minutes and it only cost 55$, the Gentleman that showed up was very nice, if you want good service in a timely matter for a great price give them a call first!! Thank you guys!!< /Review>

Low Key Locksmith has been my go to twice now. Both times I received a very quick response from a knowledgeable professional. Zaid knows exactly what to do to get the job done and the price was very reasonable. Not like some other locksmiths that will gouge you super hard because they know you are in need of service. Thank you Low Key Locksmith!!< /review>

This company is amazing. Not sure how many employees they have but they came through and delivered. The guy showed up right on time and got straight to work. He did an amazing job.

<Review>My purse was stolen. Amongst many things, it contained my house and car keys (no spares).😢 I called Low Key Locksmith and they gave me a sensible estimate. Technician Ziad was at my house within 25 minutes. He made duplicate house and car keys (for two cars) for me in a short time, and the overall cost was surprisingly reasonable. Ziad was excellent! Great customer service! I highly recommend Low Key Locksmith and will tell all my friends. They are reliable, professional, and reasonably priced. They will definitely be my “go to” locksmith company in the future!<//Review>< Pics>

These people are really good and fast. The owner Zaid, is really respectful and knows how to do his job good. I lost my keys in placerville and he got here within 45 minutes from roseville and did good quality work within 20 minutes of him being here. Really knows his stuff<//Text>

I called this service after the initial locksmith I called didn't show up. This man arrived less than 15 minutes after I called and he got me into my house in about 10 minutes. I am beyond pleased with the service, the price was great and if I get locked out again I will ne calling them back.< /Text>

<Time>1551238661888<//Time><rate>5</rate><review>By far the fastest locksmith. Same day service I called right when I got off work and met the locksmith Zaid  an hour later at my home. Excellent customer service and very helpful and patient. It was bad enough that he beat me to my house but I forgot I had to switch batteries from 1 car to another. He also gave me hand with that. I'm not going to mention the great deal he is offering me for programming one key and two spares with chips for two different cars. its a very sweet deal !!!!!! If you don't believe me call them and see for yourself highly recommended. I want to thank you, Low Key Locksmith (Zaid) for your awesome deal, great service and kindness.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I am sooooo grateful for Zaid at Low Key Locksmith. I got locked out of my car, couldn't get in with my remote key and Zaud showed up in less than 10 mins to help! And ontop of the really good fast service he had a BRAND NEW remote controlled key I was able to buy for my 2010 Dodge Charger!!! Thank you so much Zaid!! I highly recommend Low Key Locksmith if you are locked out of your car!!< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
My children 15,13,&11 & myself had just relocated about 2yrs ago to Orangevale,Sacramento CA & had to downsize into a townhouse rental & my 13 yr old daughter had a few of her friends over & horse played around where she locked her self out of her bedroom. Where our guests clothes & Cell Phone could not be gotten to.

I'm impressed, & so thankful for  Low Key Locksmith- the owner Zaden heard my urgent plea for help at 1030pm on a Friday night w/ request for service to help unlock my daughter's bdrm ... that couldn't have waited for the morning (as we had plans for guest to stay the nite in her room).

The service reply was prompt within 23 minutes. Professional Wrk Van, Prepared w/ accurate tools,  and Prompt & Personable customer service!!

I'd recommend LowKey Locksmith at top of my list as 100% reliable  & I'd  hire them again in a heart beat, if needed in the future.

The service charge was well worth A++ Well worth it, resolving my predicament & as fast as 10minutes.   My kids were grateful, and were relieved to get back to enjoying their evening & to not be without their Pajamas, warm blankets & Cell Phone...Lol
--  (of course)!!🤗😎 Thanks a Million!!👏< /review>

Hello ... I had a difficult time on my 94 deville . Zaid was honest a very knowledgeable about the situation and only charged me a great price on a lockout and replaced keys on a late night. I recommend him to all my friends<//text>

My son loves this gym. I really appreciate that the owner is always available to answer questions, and the staff is not just teenagers working for their own tuition like other gyms. Solid program where the coaches instruct, not just babysit. Best gymnastics facility in the city!< /Review>

<review>As soon as you step a foot in the door you can notice the high quality, not only in their vast equipment but in the personnel. Coaches are highly qualified and they count with excellent programs to help the kids exceed their goals. From day 1 that I brought my daughter she has shown large improvement of course she will keep progressing with time and practice but I can easily leave that in the hand of her coaches.
My daughter loves that place and is aspiring to make it to the 4th level team and compete with them, I highly recommend this place :)< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80d95210c08dcebd:0x99f837b14bd21689</GmapID></record>

<time>1508455069815</time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>Instructor made my daughter cry because she couldn't do a move correctly. My daughter was put on the spot twice and forced to do 50 sit ups. The instructor kept going on how it's a safety issue.  Witch I totally understand.  I don't think it's ok for an adult, Intentional or not,  to communicate with children in any aggressive way. My daughter was crying and She has never cried how She cried that day. There was obviously miss communication. What ever point she tried to make to my daughter could of been delivered professionally. None of the staff understood me. They started talking about me right in front of me. So unproffesional!  She refused to see her wrong and never apologized to my daughter or me. This is a place where parents take their kids to have fun. Not be put down or put on the spot for what they can't do. This isn't a boot camp. Not all kids come im hhere with the dream of being an Olympic. Some come to not be home and try new things. To keep their mind occupied. She kept going on that she is her coach and that's her job. I don't care who you are, these are human beings you are dealing with and they deserve to be spoken to with respect and compassion. Did anyone understand. NO ONE. I hope the owner read this and let's the coaches know to bring it down a notch when it comes to communicating with children, if they are doing something wrong or unsafe.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>(Translated by Google) My sister loves coming to gymnastics here, and I like to come watch her. The place is very clean, there's plenty of seats for spectators, it's air conditioned, and there's free wifi. As far the gymnastics goes: my sister loves her teachers (they pay a lot of attention to her individual abilities and goals), the equipment is brand new, and she feels like she's part of a family. I highly recommend San Diego Royal Gymnastics, it's truly a great place for kids to develop their gymnastic abilities.

A mi hermana le encanta venir a la gimnasia aquí, y me gusta venir a verla. El lugar está muy limpio, hay muchos asientos para los espectadores, aire acondicionado y wifi gratis. En lo que respecta a la gimnasia: mi hermana ama a sus profesores (prestan mucha atención a sus habilidades y objetivos individuales), el equipo y los apartos son nuevos y ella se siente parte de una familia.

Zero stars.

I went there to replace my battery, and my phone is dead the following day. Apple didn't even tell me that there is a chance of the phone becoming dead. The support people tried to deceive me into buying a new phone. I told them that the apple service center is responsible for fixing it if the phone was working and dead the next day. I'm so disappointed in Apple. Worst experience ever! Do not visit this place for phone repairs.<//Review>

< Review>
Relax you are in apple zone; Today I really experienced the true meaning of costumer service.  I was frustrated because it’s been a week since I dropped my beats headphones at the service department, and I didn’t get any response about it since then. After I explained my situation to the service department at the apple store. They start with apologies and offered my a new headphones and also they gave me a small apple headphones. Fast, easy and efficient. Thanks Roger< /Review>

< Review>
I haven't been to an apple store since pre-pandemic. I was unaware you needed an appointment. I felt discriminated against as they were selective on who they allowed into the store without an appointment. A couple and I arrived at the same time and I wasn't assisted. I couldn't help but to feel that I was turned away because I was dressed more casual. I am a long time apple customer and recently purchased an ipad pro and wasn't allowed to purchase accessories.

The genius bar floor staff and the supervisor were both very rude. If this situation was handled differently I would not have been so upset. They should have staff available to help assist people in scheduling appointments or purshasing products online. There was zero customer service. They simply tell you to get lost.</Review>

Terrible customer service! My father who’s an elder went to ask for help and no one would help him because he spoke only Spanish. They told him they didn’t have any Spanish speaking employees and were really rude to him when all he was doing was saying he didn’t understand English!! Terrible place</text>

<text>Please do not go here. I came in to get my computer fixed and left with it home without looking at it. To later(couple days) find out that a key on my keyboard was missing idk what the managers name is but they were tall, white male with curly hair. they told me that they gave it to me in good condition which is a lie bc when I gave it to them there was no key missing. his evidence was documentation not even a picture just writing. I keep telling him that he was wrong bc he was!! He kept going back and forth with me about it then tell me if I wanted them to fix it is was gonna be $400+. They didn’t help me just damaged my property. Do not trust them with your devices. PLEASE don’t come here. I’m disgusted!!!</text></record>

<Text>The service is excellent. I gave two stars because I bought a MacBook Air, and the camera was grainy. I was told by the service that the product is working as is. I purchased a product thinking I got a premium product but got a doodoo quality product, and Apple will not fix it. When I bought the Air, the sales person did not mention the camera quality. So please don't make my mistake, check the camera quality among other things before making your purchase because it is an investment.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Visited to return a device. Had made the appointment online to avoid having to wait. The staff did a temperature check and I was in and out in no time. They are doing an amazing job with the customer service in store despite the Covid19 situation. All staff maintained strict level of sanitization and social distancing. Everyone wore a mask.</review>

Alex had great customer service and recommendations to which MacBook would be a great fit for what i do at school. Ive actually haven't been to a store lately with customer service as good as this location. During this pandemic, i really like how they take your temperature and ask quick questions about symptoms. The whole team was nice 👍</review>

<resp>None<//resp><text>I brought my mac pro in  for a overheating issue, per the apples support recommendation to take it into the store because maybe i could save money just replacing the fan for $200 instead of a flat fee of $500 if i ship it to apple for repair. so i made and appointment to bring it in, the tech  at the store did not agree with the apple support, he said it's not the fan right off the batch, no diagnosing test,  and talked me into trading in for a gift card,  and did tell me that after the trade in it will be final. On  the way home I realised that I just got $500 gift card  for a $2300 computer, so I called them right  back hoping if they still let me get it fixed,  and  they said I could come back within a week to have it fixed, I made an appointment a week later, I even called them the second time to make sure  they have my computer and that it's ok if I come in right on the 7th day, they confirmed yes. On my appointment yesterday, they denied ever talked to me on the phone and and that  they don't have my macbook anymore, they gave me a case number with customer relation and said to wait for a phone call . I walked out feeling i just got lied too, Both Apple and the store need to straighten their act on communication to customer  and between themselves. I am very upset!</text><Gmap_id>0x808e33d5e09d498d:0xc55484e185ced019<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Well..... I came in today because my pops managed to delete the phone app on his i8+  No that's not a typo, he actually managed to delete something that is undeleteable lol!!!
I spent 20 min with a very knowledgeable employee who was scratching his head as to how my father managed to do this. Long story short he ended up having to wipe my pops phone clean and start all over. I was super happy with his service, after he wiped the phone he helped me set some things up to help pops not do that again. Great service Apple!!! 5 stars at this location< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Took my son's phone to be blown out. Something was blocking it from charging. Customer service was excellent & they didn't even charge us for the service. They also look, fix, diagnose my MAC computer right then & there no charge for them to look at it! It was great!!</review>

The place is nice and the customer service was okay. But they won't tell you what's wrong with your device. They make up lies and say it will cost you 1000s of dollars when it might in reality only cost 20 bucks.</Text>

<Text>Thank you to all the staff at the Oakridge Apple store especially Josh . I went in with my 2011 Mac Book Pro that would not turn on and he was such a terrific listener that we  resolve my problem quickly.  He was so personal!!  I have taken classes for my new Apple 5 watch and my iphone 11 Pro and all the instructors are fabulous and soo patient .

Friendly staff. Lots to look at and play with, tho I don't see many iPads besides the pros. The wait for Genius Bar wasn't that bad. They don't do some repairs locally, so expect to be without your device until they can ship it out and get it back...< /text>

The worst apple buying experience ever. Called apple in morning to make appointment and got a 11am slot. Was on call for about 20 min, the rep took all info and I got to the store at the time just to find out they don’t have any reservation for me. Made me wait another hour on the phone to verify. At this point I don’t even want stupid apple phone anymore.

This place is a joke l, customer service is horrible. Go to some other store instead.<//Text>

Apple service has just moved to dumb all over. Here for a battery change on an old iPhone 6. My appointment is at 3:15 but ran into a schedule conflict so figured I would drop off the phone early. I didn’t expect to get an early repair just need to leave the device early. Oh no sir! Pretentious Apple wont have any of that. I’m told no one can check it in and inspect it. What the heck is that! I’ve been through the routine before, they take it and put a new battery in then I get it back in 90 minutes. Not to complicated WRONG! Meanwhile standing here watching all the red-shirts doing nothing.< /review>

Did not feel welcomed at all when I came to pick up my orders. I work in retail and I know how difficult it can be when all customers want something at the same time but at least say “ welcome in”. By the time I got helped I still ended up waiting another 30 min to get my product because they kept forgetting who’s pick ups we’re who’s. Maybe just a bad day.<//review>

The wait was too long. The service wait was so long but the help they gave me was useful. They said they would not take my iPhone because I replaced the screen and the button was a different color then the screen. So I replaced the screen with the original screen and went back there the next day. They still took the same amount of long time they had the day before. They were useful to me again though because they did buy my iPhone and gave me a $100 iTunes gift card for my old iPhone 6s+. They are always usually really busy so if you go there you will most likely have to wait for their service there's always a full store of people.</Text>

Went in to buy a 7+ at 8:20 pm the girl at the front of the store said they did not have time to sell me the phone, even though it was in stock. Store was not busy! Apple needs to hire kids that understand basic selling. Someone wants to spend 900 dollars and u send them away. Complete morons.< /text>

Who provide the wait time for service of 150 min ?

Why don't have a good service center ?

What's the agenda and goal here ?

Helpfulness in front desk - is very poor

Back end workers are hard workers . 👌
Need some correct supervision.
Bunch  of folks who act  like geeks but apple seems to be Greek to them , just wondering ..</Text>

< review>
On Oct. 9 - Sunday morning - my daughter and I arrived at the store at about 10:30, not bothering to check when it opened, we were early. At about 10:45, a gentlemen came out and asked everyone waiting to join one of two queues. One for new purchases and one for technical assistance. We got in line for technical assistance, and within a few minutes, we were registered and told that we would probably be assisted at about 11:20, but they would text us when ready. Right on time, we received a text, were seated at the genius bar and in a very short time had a replacement phone for the one that my daughter had dropped in water a day earlier. The technician was polite, fast and thorough. The replacement phone was not inexpensive - $300 + tax - but the service was great and we had a working phone in a short time.< /review>

<text>I haven’t had service on my phone for 4 weeks. I went in to Apple to get it fixed and when I was told from my service provider that I should come in and get my phone fixed for free by Apple, because it was a callback model, they laughed then went on with what they wanted to do and restored my current broken phone to factory settings so now I have nothing on my phone and guess what, my phone is still broken because I still have the same model phone. Also I had to show up at 9:00am just to wait in line for an hour till they opened just to get my phone’s data erased for no reason.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Very poor customer service. Just to figure out what was wrong with my iPhone they told me to wait there for 4 hours and after 4 hours it took only 2 minutes to figure out what is wrong with my iPhone, and then again they told me it will take one week to fix it. I would definitely not recommend this place.</review>

I took my roommate here to buy the new I-phone and got the worst service in my lifetime. Why AT&T ? You are suppose to be the best. We left sprint for you, and this is what we get. The youngster didn't help at all. He stood there and had me figure out why my account would open up to add my Roomey on my plan 🤔 I almost want to go elswhere. I'm a actually looking into Verizon. Thanks for nothing AT&T 🤨 won't refer you to none of my peeps ...<//Text>

<review>Not as busy as the valley fair location. The 'Genius' that was helping me wasn't too knowledgeable on the repair I brought my macbook in for and as a result, my quote was more than it needed to be. I was able to talk to another person before my repair was started and they resolved my issue though.< /review>< user_name>

Ross thought it was a good idea to asked me to spend a discounted price of 250$ (apple care discount) to fix the brand new macbook pro that wouldn't even turn on when I unboxed it. Because the technicians saw indicators that it was water damaged, they assumed it was my fault and my responsibility to spend more money on something that I didn't even get to use yet. I told him if I was okay with a refurbished product I would have bought an open box item. I have never felt so scammed !!!! I AM BEYOND PISS AFTER SPENDING A FRUSTRATING HOUR AND A HALF TRYING TO JUSTIFY FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO AND LEAVING THE STORE WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT. ROSS IS A JOKE TO BE A STORE MANAGER.<//text>

<text>Before I used Apple as an example of how to train my teams w Customer Service. Now, in all fairness there is many more customers and not enough customer service.

The very Law that set Jobs apart from the rest was The Law of Diffusion of innovation, which is now working against 🍎now . 50,000 reporters as the Early Adopters, who care, who listen, who are obsessed, now tell a different story.
The same Law will unfortunately tell customers what Apple really cares about and thats only profit and greed.
Is Apple remarkable? Is there current service system worth leaving a remark about?

It's disappointing.  Apple is more concerned w the profit versus the customer satisfaction.

I guess they can make this adjustment w twice as much capital as EXXONMOBIL.

Unfortunately money and power has the ability to disregard the absolute system of Character.

I hope Mr: Cook can adjust his processes to take care of the customer and not the profit. This is what made Apple #1.

Mr. Cook? Do you have a comment?</text><pics>None<//pics></record>

Bad attitude and poor management. With a 9:00 to 9:30 reservation we have to wait until past 10. Some of the staff don't even bother explain the situation.</review>

Its better to come here with an appointment. Otherwise, its difficult to get hold of someone to help. Came here to pick up an order and was helped promptly. Can get super crowded during weekends.< /Text>

<Review>I have gone to this Apple store 8 times in the past two months but my experience has been quite bad here. The staff is arrogant. I was in a queue and I asked a staff member if I am seeing something in the store in another corner, how would you contact me. He replied that we would throw your name out of the queue if you are not at this table. I consider it a bit rude. During another visit, a staff member rudely told me that we do not have resources all the time to address customer’s concerns. I have to go to this store as it is near my home but I will now start going to Apple Store in Valley Fair. I am indeed very disappointed by the attitude of the staff at this store.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Came back for my appointment, they then informed me I had to turn off the tracking system and to make sure that all the data was backed up because they just replace the phone. Would have been nice to know the first time around, so I wouldn't have to sit there trying to contact someone without a phone to figure that stuff out.<//Review>< pics>

I have taken my computer in for the same problem 3 times.  Although the same problem reoccurs after several months, the techs have been most helpful.  Not their fault this is a faulty computer.  I made a phone appt. and have been taken quickly.<//Review>

<Review>I came here on 2 different occasions:

1. Cracked screen replacement- waited at Genius Bar for 3 1/2 hours. They said they had to put on 3 screens because the first 2 wouldn't calibrate.

2. Ear piece - I was having a hard time hearing anyone in the earpiece. The "GENIUS" told me it would be $59 to diangose and $159 to replace earpiece if needed. I took it somewhere else. Free diagnostics and they cleaned under the earpiece with a simple dust brush. If it was the earpiece that was damaged, I may have had it replaced for the price but some places wave the diagnostic fee if you have the service done there. That wasn't offered to me.

Won't be going back here again!</Review>< rate>

The service cannot be anywhere worse. I got an unlocked iPhone 7 plus last year, and surprisingly to find i cannot switch to any carrier other than at&t. The technician was very sure the device should be compatible with any general US carrier, and asked me to check with Verizon more than once. It's turned out the so called unlocked 7 that we paid with full price when purchasing can only work with at&t. The store manager was so rude that she kept blaming me for getting a wrong phone, and not understanding what "unlock" means. So, anyone who has any problem with their devices should avoid going to this store, since the top manager will always always blaming the customer for doing everything wrong, but will refuse to solve the prolem.< /Review>

Really disappointed by the service at this Apple store. The Apple "Geniuses" are unwilling to provide all the information unless you ask them questions repeatedly. I wanted to pick up the Forever Upgrade plan. I was made to wait, run around and finally leave without getting the device eventually. And this over 2.5 hours!< /Review>

<Text>I got an Apple Watch as a gift. I brought my unopened Apple Watch and asked whether I can exchange the band color. The Apple employee acted like a policeman. He said it's over 14 days so no longer can be exchanged. He told me he was going to go inside to check the receipt but he lied to me. He went inside to talk to his shift manager. And he came out with the shift manager accused me that I might stole the Apple Watch because I don't have proof of purchase.<//Text>< rate>

Apple Store Oakridge or the technician must be thief's compliance, I totally agree. otherwise, how come the technician didn't check thief's ID or name but immediately erased my laptop and let the thief go, in just 10 minutes, even with the Lost Mode ON?

the thief stole victim's laptop from the public library, then directly went to this Apple Store, then walked away with clean macbook, so easy!</text>

<text>I ordered an iPhone 7 and chose this store to pick up Today. After I walked in I obtained my iPhone 7 pretty smoothly. But I noticed the iPhone box was not completely sealed like how they sold previous generations iPhones. It was just wrapped with some kind of rectangle plastic. I had a second thought but it didn't go down to my brain. Later on when I unboxed the iPhone 7 I was disappointed by Apple the first time. I could tell the box and accessories were not brand new. Then I booted the iPhone 7. It had hissing noise when I put it near my ear. The hissing problem was magnified while recording a video...that noise. Finally, I was confident that this iPhone 7 was a returned or replaced one. Apple, you really really should not re-sell the defect phones. I just miss Steve Jobs. I will return this semi-finished product tomorrow.< /text>< pics>

Very unhelpful did not treat me with very good customer service kept passing me on to the next person in the store even though they where talking to each other in the store. Continoulsly told me they could help then would tell me I have to wait hours. I finally make an appointment after going in twice and the lady on the phone in the store was very rude when I called asking if there was an open time for an appointment.</text>

<text>I went to the Apple Store at Oakridge Mall due to an issue I was having with iphoto.  I lost a lot of photos ever since I upgraded to OS X Yosemite.  After waiting for two hours (which is to be expected since I didn’t make an advance reservation), a technician by the name of Justin was assigned to help me.  I was appalled by his arrogance and condescension.  I admit I am not very computer literate, but this technician rubbed it on me with his impatience and body language.  He wore his frustration on his sleeve.  Everyone has the right to be treated respectfully.  A job like this requires positive interaction with customers, interpersonal skills, and empathy - none of which this technician has.  I was aghast at his behavior and asked to speak with the store manager who assured me that he would talk to his staff so such incidents don’t recur.< /text><user>107713015201507103061</user>< Time>

I came in to get my mac fixed. I was expecting that I would have to pay out of pocket for the issue on my Mac,even though I have warranty for it. I was helped out by Chris, who went above and beyond my expectations for customer service, and really helped me out. I was told the turn around time would be about 1-2 business days. The problem was fixed by the next day. This is definitely the Apple Store to come to.</Review>

<text>One of the tech supports is really lack of responsibilities and skills. Not because he couldn’t figure out the issue of my IPhone, but just leave the unresolved problem to me. I’m so curious how apple hair these kind of people to work in the from line with customers. So rude and I’m very disappointed.<//text>< userid>

Like most Apple stores, if you go there when it's uncrowded, it's great.  If you hit a bad time, forget about it; just turn around and leave.< /Review>

< Review>
I returned the original sealed MacPro last Sat. with a receipt of this new Mac in a week to this store and still haven't received any refund credit.   The manager there last Monday constantly told me it's a problem with American Express Card and asked me to deal it with them.  So, I brought AMEX statement to their store and it was totally disregarded as not their store statement.  I've wasted so much time on this and become quite disappointed after becoming the poor victim of their transaction.  Hopefully, the new manager Chery will really take care of this as she promised Monday.  More to follow ...<//Review>

A few suggestions for the Oakridge Apple Store:

1) Before you nonchalantly ask a customer, "what's your password?", remind them that their private data could be seen and used by others, including Apple employees. Ask them whether they've encrypted their hard drive. And give them the option to erase their hard drives themselves. You are the experts, so inform your customers. You can't expect barbers, truck drivers, doctors, and plumbers to know about data theft, FileVault encryption, two-step verification, computer fraud, and other security issues. Tell corporate to update your training if you have to. We live in an era of government mass surveillance, data mining, financial fraud, and FBI/CIA overreach, so it's up to all of us to keep our data safe.

2) Call back when you say you'll call back. Follow through on your words.

3) It shouldn't take 2-3 weeks for the AppleCare warehouse to find a hard drive that took them 2 days to fix. If it takes that long, then there is a problem with inventory control and supply chain management. Call them and push them to perform. Escalate issues all the way up to management if you have to. Change starts from within!

Just be more professional overall. You are the face of Apple Inc, so try your utmost to represent them well.</Review>

Apple = thief's accomplice?

Technician in Apple Store Helped Thief to Erase My Macbook Pro While It was Playing Alarming Sound.

My macbook pro was stolen in San Jose Public Library on 07/15/16, I requested police officer for help immediately and used "find my iPhone" to locate my laptop as well as "playing sound". 20 minutes later my laptop appeared near Oakridge apple store. I drove to this apple store right away and arrived in 20 minutes. I thought I would catch up with the thief and report to police, because if the thief seeking help from apple store, he must make appointment with technician, which ALWAYS needs long time to wait. However, the manager told me that a man just stopped by with a "playing sound" laptop and asked to erase all the data. Surprisingly, the technician erased the STOLEN laptop immediately, WITHOUT validation of anything!! My laptop required password to login as well as displaying my name on the screen, and it was registered with my Apple ID and password. However, apparently, the thief doesn’t know any information about the laptop, and most importantly the laptop was PLAYING ALARMING SOUND!! The technician here even didn't check thief's ID or name, just immediately erased my laptop and let the thief go, WITHOUT any sense of security and responsibility for customer. Such a weird thing just happened, I really can’t believe it. It  looks like this apple store is so convenient to the thieves, so RIDICULOUS and UNACCEPTABLE. I already reported to police and requested for a camera record release. The store refused me to talk to the technician for details, the manager said she didn't want the involved technician to be interviewed by the customer. I was TOTALLY SHOCKED by the whole thing. Oakridge Apple Store is always crowded but the thief just did the thing very quickly, no waiting line. I feel like my macbook pro was stolen by the thief and the apple store. This apple store don’t care about customer at all but thief friendly.

I have already talked to Apple customer relations and Apple Care department about my situation, nothing help. The whole thing is WEIRD AND RIDICULOUS, it looks like the apple store cooperated with the thief in a good way.

I appreciate if you have any comments and suggestions, and please share this if possible.< /text>

< review>
Went in the store to ask about upgrade on my phones.
The first person that welcome me was nice, but not knowledgeable about the programs available. So she kindly referred me to a "specialist." In that store, specialist seems to mean cocky, arrogant and misleading. Not only was he not nearly as knowledgeable as he should have, he had a bad attitude, looked-us down for seemingly asking the wrong questions, with a belief that anything not apple was worthless. The only thing he accomplished was to convince us to start looking at Samsung phones, which after 5 years of faithful use of our iPhone, we did.
To top it off, as we later found out, that sales person bluntly lied to us about the programs available for AT&T so as to sell us apple leasing programs. I am ever so surprised at the difference in service level across different apple stores. The ones in Palo Alto or Stanford mall offer such a vastly differently positive customer experience. I also previously had a bad experience in that store when the iWatch came in.
I am guessing that in the interview process, when a new recruits is a bit rough, he is sent down to South San Jose. There is something about that specific store, so in the meanwhile, I go to either Los Gatos or Palo Alto...< /review>

Went to the store and spoke with Derek. Showed him a picture I'd recently taken of the texting issue I'm having with my new iPhone 6 Plus (the text box disappears entirely- I have to close text completely and reopen to text back). This is the response I got:
"Nothing is perfect"; "We designed the application to close all the way so you could close and reopen it to fix these kind of things"; "You're lucky this has never happened before on all of your other iphones, it's just one of those things"
I had told him it's never happened on any other iphones (I've been a customer since iphone 4). I had even asked if there's a bug fix for it. Derek was not interested in looking at my phone at all. He never even touched it, it never left my hand.
Extremely dissatisfied with this 'customer service'.</Text>

I had an appointment and came on time, but was ignored for around 45 minutes before getting help. Then I waited 30 minutes only for the rep to tell me to come back next week. I came back next week and had to wait again for service.</text>

Horrible customer service. I asked for the phone with unlocked phone and the guy showed me a locked phone with monthly payment with the carrier. Took about 3 hrs in the store.<//text>

Worst Customer service I ever had in apple location, one of the employee with a name of joys or something like that treat me like a s....t he was rude , disrespectful and basically told me F... you , the worst was when I ask for his name he said it to me the way line he owns the store and telling me do wherever you want . WOW, WOW , WOW . I never thought Apple will hire people like him .

Hope some of the executives read this review and take a action because this location is horrible.< /review>

I had an appointment and came on time, but was ignored for around 45 minutes before getting help. Then I waited 30 minutes only for the rep to tell me to come back next week. I came back next week and had to wait again for service.<//Review>
