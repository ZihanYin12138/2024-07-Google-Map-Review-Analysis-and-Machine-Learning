<Text>Not only does this facility offer many different kinds of units catered to your specific needs, it is extremely clean and well kept.  Eric the manager who is very friendly, informative, and kind was able to help get me a unit at an affordable cost, and I feel very confident and safe leaving my belongings at this location. I am very happy to be utilizing a unit from this storage facility.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

After her calling around several different places and having to leave messages orangecrest called me back and had one unit left. They are extremely helpful and are so kind and any supplies you need anything you need they have it there and it is not overpriced and make sure you understand everything, no hidden fees. And the best of all o no contracts it's a month to month arrangement
I highly recommend orangecrest self storage</review>

Highly recommended! Front the first day I used their facility to the last, I have found the staff to be professional and courteous. The property is very well kept and never saw anything that made me concerned that my belongings would be at risk. Upon my move out, Eric was extremely helpful. He made the experience easy and convenient I would recommend highly to anyone seeking a storage facility to Orangecrest Storage.< /text>

Very clean, secure storage. Easy access. I had a climate controlled storage unit and it was perfect for my needs through this past brutally hot summer. Eric Standing was out-Standing!! So helpful and such a nice guy. I've moved out now, gone to Texas, but would use this storage facility again without hesitation.<//text>

I had a storage unit here for a few months (temporary move) and this place was great. It was an easy process to get the unit, I actually reserved it online and was able to walk in on move-in day to purchase a lock & was shown the unit within minutes. Every one of the staff I dealt w/ while coming into the office was great and pleasant to work with. They seem to monitor the grounds frequently. I moved out in a rush before the office had opened so I couldn't close my account right then but when I called to close it, they advised they had already seen it was empty and closed out my account, which I appreciate so much. If you need a storage unit, long term or short, this is definitely the place to go. It's also super convenient w/ Dunkin next door! Pre-move fuel lol Thank you Orangecrest Self Storage! I will definitely consider you guys again if I ever need to move out this way again.</Text>

Eric is very good at what he does! Customer services is EXCELLENT!!!! I had just made my 2nd stop at a storage place a mile down the road (across from Farmer Boys to be exact😉), and the demeanor I encountered upon walking in was bland, not welcoming at all. When I asked for prices he just handed me a list, and I almost fell over backwards looking at those rates.  But when I walked into Orangecrest, Eric was very friendly and welcoming. He delightfully went over their prices, process, and policies. The rates are unbeatable, and the large facility is very well maintained and clean. He even showed me the storage unit before doing any of the paperwork. I was glad I didn't have to walk out of yet one more storage location, as I had already been to 2 prior to Orangecrest. It was truly a pleasant experience👍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<//Text>

I was on the fence about which unit to get and fortunately was told that if the unit i chose was too small, that i can move up to another unit. Which did end up happening! So simple and easy! I can’t express how amazing their customer service is! Id say #1 place in Riverside!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dca522919b0bcd:0xb432f71806f3f5c< /Gmap_id></record>

My experience with Orangecrest storage was great. Cindy was very helpful and explained everything regarding my new storage unit. It was very clean and had easy access. She took me to the site and made sure it was clean. She was very helpful and had a very pleasant personality. I would definitely recommend this storage. The location was great and it was very easy to get the U Haul in and out. Thank you again Cindy for your help</Text>

<Review>I highly recommend Orangecrest Self Storage! I recently had a storage unit there for about 10 years. Eric runs the facility very well! Everything is well maintained and kept up nicely. The area is always clean, monitored, gated and safe. You can definitely tell that Eric takes great pride in the company! I am thankful that I was able to store my belongings at such a great storage facility!< /Review><user_id>113739468198401871683< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80dca522919b0bcd:0xb432f71806f3f5c<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>I recently got a storage unit from Orangecrest Self Storage and who knew getting a storage unit would be so entertaining.. The manager of the facility Eric was so friendly charming and very funny.. He made what I thought was going to be a bad experience better than I could have ever expected... I had to wait a few minutes while he helped another couple and he was very apologetic.. He helped me with my moving supplies and help me pick out the perfect unit for what I needed.. I brought my son along and he even engaged with him... it was very sweet... I would recommend Orangecrest Self Storage to anyone looking for a storage unit..  They even have a moving truck available.. Thank you for a great experience...<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I moved back to Riverside for a few months, and needed somewhere to store my furniture. I drove by Orangecrest Self Storage nearly every day, as it is located conveniently near where I was living. I found the staff to be very helpful, courteous, and friendly from the moment I stepped in to rent, to the moment I left. Additionally, the property is very clean and secure. I felt safe leaving my belongings, and felt confident they would be well taken care of. I will definitely return if services are needed in the future, and I highly recommend to anyone looking for an easy, safe storage facility!<//Text>

<Text>I just became a  renter at this facility. The two people I met were above my expectations. This  Facility, I really wish and hope they know how much of an asset Eric and Angelica are. I called Angelica quite a few times in one day and she was very patient and very courteous, especially for me who called like four times.  I  Felt so bad but she put me at ease that it was OK. Although I only met her on the phone she was such a delightful (lack of a better word right now) person to talk to you. When I met Eric the following day I was flabbergasted that I got to work with these two wonderful employees employees, 1 which was the manager over the place,  and acted like he wasn't over anyone.  Number two who is just a normal employee was very now knowledgeable and friendly just like Eric. Eric treats his people very fairly and very good and treats them with dignity. I would consider this place one of the best storage facilities I've ever done business with. With me being a vice President at my last company,  I would hire them In a heartbeat. Thank you so much and you are truly blessed to have these two people work  with your team.  Kudos to your company and this facility.   Being new to the state of California, I really hope I find a job that has this type of people working for them.  I would love to get up in the morning and go to work knowing the people who I work with are pleasurable to work with.

Thanks again,

They're always willing to work with you, no matter the circumstances.  That is the big reason why I've remained a customer for so long.  The facility is always clean and accessible.  I would recommend this storage place to anyone, anytime.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you Eric!<//Review>< time>

This is a review regarding Orangecrest Self Storage located on Van Buren in Riverside. I always enjoy going to the Storage place because every time I go to pay my monthly bill or to talk payment options the staff is always so nice and so helpful in all my storage needs. No matter what time I go the facility is always clean and always stocked with moving and storage supplies.
I like the convience of having access to my storage unit and the reasonable hours that the Storage is open.
I really appreciate Eric the manager's help with assisting me with payments over the phone or working with me if my monthly payment is going to be late. Eric is truly a peoples person willing to help and assist me with all of our needs and concerns we may have at that time. The best part of this there are no hidden fees the staff always gives us accurate billing amounts. So if you're looking for a good storage facility I recommend going to Orangecrest Self Storage for all your storage and moving needs. We have a history with Orangecrest for over 8 years plus and I highly recommend them. You've tried the rest now try the best Orangecrest Self Storage.
Thank you,
Damon Meyers</review>

<text>I have been with Orangecrest Self Storage for three years.  There has not been one time that I have even considered changing storage places.  The facility is clean, and the staff is friendly and well trained.  I have had to add and/or change the size of my storage units on a couple of occasions and the manager, Eric, goes out of his way to help me assess the correct size for the items I need to store.  Eric is extremely knowledgeable about the business overall, and I can tell that he truly enjoys the work he does as evidenced in how he treats each customer that comes through the door.  No matter how busy they may be, they make sure that each customer knows that they are just as valued as anybody else.  I am extremely happy that I found Orangecrest Self Storage!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Found Orangecrest Self Storage online and read all the great reviews. My wife and I decided to rent a unit. Initially called and Eric was very helpful. When we came in to sign up, the experience was great just the like reviews. The location is accessible. The entire place is clean including the unit we rented. Eric provided us all the information we need to know. Customer service is phenomenal. The only burden I had was moving in all my heavy stuff (hehehe). I highly recommend this place.</Review>

<Text>My grandma went back with her husband and they were being rude towards them the whole time. They were being rushed to get everything out. He stood over them and watched them take everything out of their storage. And repeated over and over to “hurry up” and that he “wants to close already.” He was being rude and impatient we do not plan on coming back or recommending this place to anyone. Poor customer service< /Text>< Pics>

US Storage at Orangecrest is awesome.  I can't say enough nice things about the facility AND the people.  The manager, Erick, was super knowledgable, friendly, and accommodating.  He patiently answered all of my questions - even when it was clearly after closing time.  Best service ever!!!<//Review>

I am writing on behalf of the Woodcrest Christian High School Cross-country team.  Our team engages in an annual fundraiser to fund uniforms, track fees and awards.  Our giant obstacle this year was where to store the ultimate 3000 pair of used shoes we gathered.  The storage manager, Eric, was incredibly helpful and supportive of our efforts.  Though we needed a unit for a short period, he was instrumental in making this year's fundraiser a huge success.  We are very grateful for all his assistance.  Thanks from the entire team members and coaching staff.< /review>

<GmapID>0x80dca522919b0bcd:0xb432f71806f3f5c< /GmapID><text>Orangecrest Self Storage has been nothing short of perfect for my family's storage needs. My wife called from the U-Haul truck somewhere on I20, as we moved across country from Texas back home to Riverside. We needed a climate controlled storage for our items, and although at the time Orangecrest Self Storage only had a couple of smaller units available, the price was right, and the property manager, Eric Standing, was very pleasant as we spoke. It wasn't enough for all of our stuff, but it helped with the items that had to be climate controlled, while the rest would have to go to another place. Just in passing I told Eric if a larger unit ever came up to "remember us," because it would be more convenient to have the stuff together. Just a few weeks later the phone rang and it was Eric, saying he'd remembered the comment and he had a larger unit coming up if we still wanted it. The larger unit allowed us to move most all of our stuff into a single unit that didn't accumulate dust, and made it easy to come and go as was needed. Between the price and the excellent service, Orangecrest is the only home for our "stuff," when our stuff can't be at home. Thank you, Eric!</text><Time>1429725847684< /Time><user_id>112053498196794274798< /user_id>< Pictures>

I've rented at multiple storage locations. The managers tend to be very rude and careless. They always had complaints about my speed or the type of trucks i take in there. I happen to have a friend living nearby Orangecrest self storage, i passed by since the stuff i store i use often for work and home. I walk in...... I felt right at home as soon the as the most sincere person i've ever met named (Eric i think) talked to in storage business helped me out. provided me with a cheaper price for my driving inconvenience and gave me exactly what i wanted for less than what i thought. I really do thank him since i feel like my stuff is safe and i feel comfortable not being bothered.
NO QUESTIONS ASKED BEST PLACE TO MAKE YOU FEEL RIGHT AT HOME !!!<//text>

<review>Great customer service. Eric got me in and out in about 15 mins. Showed me the storage room made sure it was the right one. Great location. Place looks secured and clean. What i really loved about this storage the the stoarge unit is not drywall like some other ones. So dont really have to be scared of damaging drywall!

<Date>1443242930157<//Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>This is the first time I had to use a storage facility and I really didn't know what to expect. I needed to store furniture and other items from a four bedroom home. Stress was hanging around and after spending an hour 1/2 in the 91 EB traffic I finally made it to Orange crest storage. At the office I was greeted by Manager Eric Standings. I gave him my situation. He immediately jumped on the keyboard and worked his magic. It just so happen that a tenant was vacating his large storage room that day and Eric was able to hook me up. He also had a smaller storage rm across from the larger one that was vacant so again I got hooked up. I am able to store all the funiture, clothings, in the rooms.The facility is immaculate. You would think it just recently opened but it's been around. Security with one way in  and one way out thru a keypad passcode is Awesome...Everytime I come to the office it's like hanging out with good friends. Great place Great People.  Thanks Eric for making this transition a verry smooth ride...You Da Man!!!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>I have had such a hard time finding shoes due to difficult feet, and many places being out of stock during the pandemic. However, I had an absolutely fantastic experience at Birkenstock La Mesa, with Mel being incredibly helpful. Mel not only searched the computer for any other stores that might have the shoes I wanted, she walked back into their warehouse and searched manually multiple times to find anything that the computer missed. Her customer service was absolutely fantastic, helping me figure out fit, etc, and I ended up finding 1 pair of shoes plus 1 pair of flip flops that fit great with excellent arch support. I really appreciate that Mel took the time and made the effort to help me!<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Updated Review: After receiving a response from the GM, the store was professional and accommodating in dealing with the issue I had with the shoe they sold to me. Thank you very much for that.
---------------
I have been wearing Birkenstocks for a very long time and loved them. But the experience of purchasing them at Birkenstock of San Diego during COVID has been a nightmare. I went in a month ago and did appreciate that they were practicing safe social distancing. Because of this I was not able to try my Birks on but was told to try them on at home. I got the same size my last pair was. I called the store back saying the sides felt abnormally stiff to me. I was told just to wear them more and they would break in. I was even told to take a hair dryer and heat up the sides and then walk in them. I did what I was instructed but they still hurt my feet quite a bit. I’ve never had a pair hurt this bad. I took them back to the store but was told they were worn so I could not return them. I am so disappointed in this business. I would have brought them right back but was told that if I just wore them more they would feel better. They don’t. I wasted my time and money.</text>< user_id>

The staff was amazing and knew what they were talking about. The problem comes from the main company not allowing the staff to price match even though Birkenstock is selling their shoes at a discount online through a 3rd party. That's a good way to get your brick and mortar stores to fail. In this day and age you have to price match to survive.< /Review>

<Text>Great shoes, lots of styles of Birkenstock plus many other brands. Very helpful, patient, and knowledgeable representatives. I was measured and then picked out the styles I was interested in. The clerk gladly got the boxes of shoes in two different sizes and instructed me how to properly buckle up the shoes.</Text>< name>

<date>1503592076126<//date><rate>4< /rate><Review>I went to this store to obtain a pair of birkenstock sandals that were ergonomically correct for my body because I am an over-pronator and need to be mindful of my footwear. I called first for verication purposes regarding the item I had interest in, which happened to be the Birkenstock Milano shoe. They indeed did have that model available and I then proceeded to the store location. After arriving I asked for the staff member I spoken to previously on the telephone and was subsequently acknowledged and told that I would be helped promply, which did happen. My experience was troublefree from sizing to purchase. They provide a limited number of shoe related repairs as well. If they do not have what your looking for they can order from another one of their stores and have the item delivered in a reasonable time frame. They also have a fair selection of other footwear for men, women and children.<//Review>< pictures>

I did a 7.2 mile loop here on April 10, 2021, you can see my trail recording on the Alltrails app, just look up my name and please follow me for more fun trails and my reviews.

This is a busy place to hike, but it has a lot of different trails to explore. The views are really nice, you can see the ocean from many spots. The entire place is very clean and kudos to what ever dept cares for this land. If you really want to get a great workout in, make your way to the Poles Trail. This is a leg burner, but worth it. There are also plenty of nice shady canyon trails you can take if you want to stay out of the sun. There are so many trails, I'll have to go back to explore more.

If you are interested in joining in any hikes, you can find my hikes on the "Meet Up" app under the group "Five Miles or More Hiking Group" with the times and places I'll be going. Enjoy your hiking.< /Review>

Such a beautiful trail with paths very clearly indicated. Moderate to hard in terms of difficulty, but very doable. Not crowded at all when I went.</Review>

Can't say anything bad about this trail head. Have multiple hiking trail, trail are pretty well maintain and have incline when it there. You will have a pretty work out on this trail. Can also get crowded too on the weekend. It my first time here and when I went there it was pretty foggy in the morning so didn't get to see my surrounding. Also, there no tree for shade so go early n if you do go during the afternoon please bring lots of water. They allow bike here on the trail so be careful because they came fast.< /review>

This is a perfect place to simply “get outside” and enjoy nature, sports, or simply just taking a walk. The trail opens into multiple forks so you can head towards the ocean view or stay in the canyon/valley side with an epic view spanning all of So Cal.

Easy parking, easy access, and lots to do!< /Text>

<text>Dozens of miles of trails from here, some with amazing views, some tucked away in  canyons.   (A few spots truly feel like you are far far away ... But, tbh, most of the time you are within hearing distance of one or more highways.  Still a great getaway, in the middle of Orange County.)<//text>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Pacific Ridge Trailhead is one of my most favorite spots to adventure! You can go countless times and explore new trails every time! If you’d like to walk leisurely there’s plenty of trails for that, on the contrary if you want to challenge yourself with a more strenuous hike, that can also be accomplished! This is a great go-to spot for mountain bikers, trail runners, and outdoor enthusiasts! Have fun!! :)</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I like the map, very easy to decipher and all the trail turns are well labeled so i didn't feel like i needed much help to get lost & unlost.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWkDl8lun-Te5kJMn1PTPaQIJSV1yMQWIxVwyY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqJcuOmpJsQG036oPqXYR0p_idXZJLswbG8Bjy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmwfsCuJTPUi7cy3ukmfwr6AMx5j78f7Kb0HtO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOS2OrDZky-NwogzkYfm7NUM_nUbQK--tgj5TVd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

<username>Coach Jared Covarrubias<//username><time>1499176980620<//time><rate>5</rate><Text>This is one of my favorite trails in Orange County. There is free parking and easy access in and out of the trail. It can get packed on the trail with a lot of people especially on the holidays. There is a lot of different lengths of the park also so you can do a good quick hike or a longer 6 mile hike that has some inclines. I think it is a good trail to start to use as practice to prepare for longer trails or Spartan race</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Amazing local sushi spot. Everyone is super nice. They have lunch specials and happy hour specials. Currently due to COVID everything is takeout. But they are still pushing out nothing but quality foods</Text>

We are new to El Segundo and have been trying the local Japanese restaurants, as that is our favorite cuisine. We ordered an assortment of dishes and took them home to eat. The teriyaki sauce is outstanding and the chicken served with it was quite good. The spicy tuna roll was very flavorful without being too spicy. Tuna roll, fabulous. California roll was generous and tasted great. Salmon sashimi was absolutely fresh and delectable. Even the miso soup was the best I have tasted in a long time. To top it all off, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the prices were probably even a little low for this quality of food. Which makes this an outstanding find.</text>

I like this place! They provide splendid dishes, their menu is varied, The chef in that spot is very experienced, I enjoy a lot eating all their dishes. The dishes are always of high class, the attitude towards the visitors  is friendly. I  go often to this restaurant and I not even once was unsatisfied. Highly recommended.< /Text>

Thursday sushi deals are our favorite. They have great rice and fresh fish combos in their rolls. They always give our kids extra tofu in our miso which makes them very happy.<//Review>

Seriously understaffed servers looked seriously maxed out and unable to keep up.... not their fault. Full house. No one in management seemed to notice....so about 20 minutes to order a second round of sushi and 20 min waiting for the check. This was a drag. No one watching the ship. Sorry for the 3 star but will think hard before going back< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I don’t usually write reviews and when I do it’s usually a negative experience that makes me take the time to do so. But the experience was so good that I needed to let people know.
Hana Haru is simply the best.The food is amazing, the service is outstanding and the chefs are creating happiness one dish at a time....If your reading this trying to decide if you should go......stop and just go there. You won’t regret it.
Try the rattlesnake roll.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2b1401fd86227:0x242fb4b406d2e358< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Review>I had the chicken teriyaki. The mediocre taste was drowned out by the excessive sauce. The lettuce was not chopped adequately. The food portions were slightly small for the somewhat high price.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< user_name>

<text>Some friends and I ended up at Hana Haru  when their neighboring japanese restaurant didn’t allow us to order sushi (another party had ordered 100 pieces of sushi and we were told the one sushi chef working wouldn’t make us any).

Our food was excellent! The sushi and sashimi was very flavorful and nicely presented, and there was little wait. What would help make my rating 5 stars would be to get a little more attention from the wait staff. Our drinks weren’t refilled until we were nearly ready to leave, and we had to ask for that to happen. It would also have been nice to know what time last call would be when we were seated.

Will visit again!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b1401fd86227:0x242fb4b406d2e358<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>The food was actually pretty good. Don't be put off by the vibe when you walk in, or the overpowering smell of cleaning chemicals, which is, admittedly, better than than an overpowering odor of fish. But the food is decent. I'll definitely try something different the next time I'm in the neighborhood, but you know, it's serviceable.</Text>< resp>

Excellent. I have been a patron for nearly 9 years. It is family owned and operated. The day to day running has been passed on to the younger generation. Not pretentious, family friendly, great flavors and variety.< /text>

This place has been around for years. I have only visited twice. I think they were here before Sushi was popular. Their product is OK but not amazing. The place was pretty empty both times I was here and could use some updating. I do love the portion size and price. The tempura apatizer was good and a meal in itself.</review>

3 star for the presentation and the cool ambiance. But for the roll taste and quality is just okay. I love to taste more professional sushi roll. Their service is decent. Cuz they are busy so they can just ignore me and my girlfriend. Sad this place cannot be my favorite.</Text>

<Review>My favorite sushi joint in LA, hands down. Prices are reasonable, eel is delicious, and salmon is always fresh! Was going here so much at one point the waiter would bring my friend and I our usual drinks when we sat down and one of the sushi chefs knew us by name. Sadly moved away so I do not go here as often.</Review>< Time>

Absolutely my favorite sushi restaurant! Even though I moved 2 hours away I still do my darndest to stop by every chance I get. I always get two Davids rolls- the second (unfailingly) comes home with me to devour later that night.
PLUS, I love all the people that work there.<//text>

Called in a to go order. The food I received was good. Both sushi rolls, edamame and miso soup. The problem was it took 40 mins to get my order. The staff also gave extra food to a to go order for their wait but they arrived after me. Nevertheless, the person after me did seemed to be one that came often but it still felt bad. Again, the food was good but after the service I received, I don't think I'll be returning.<//Review>

Pretty sure the noodles they use are just prepackaged low quality noodles. Not a lot of time is put into presentation. There are better Japanese restaurants in the area.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We had Birthday Sushi here, just decided to try it.  It is family owned and has been in El Segundo for 30 years - 15 of those years were with the same family.

I choose from the special menu and had Japanese Sea Bass - sashimi and Scottish Salmon sashimi.  Both very fresh and then my friend and I played with some of the rolls. We tried the external sunshine roll... now that was good !  My friend had some thing with spicy Jalapenos and spicy tuna  a little hot for me.   We finished with deep fried Ice Cream.  Not too bad for a whim !  We will be back !< /Review>< pictures>

<username>Debbie Hoffman< /username><response>None<//response><review>I have been coming here for over 6 years.  The food had always been stellar (and they serve brown rice, yippie!!!!) but the service and has been hit and miss.  Tonight, they totally changed that around.  Amazing service (Bailey in particular)!  This trip,  I ordered the Eternal Sunshine roll with brown rice...one I'll dream about!  The tempura combo (w/CA roll) is great also. Love the small town vibe, sushi chefs are personable and know their stuff.  I wish they had a better selection of wine (pinot noir please).  All in all, it's worth a trip to the Gundo!< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2b1401fd86227:0x242fb4b406d2e358<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I'm a sushi connoisseur and have eaten at many awesome places.
But I always come back to this place because William takes care of me.
Portions are large and the service is great.  William won’t serve you fish that is not fresh.
Big heart, big portions, big tummy!  Yummy!  Gotta try it!  I get all the exotic stuff that most newcomers don't eat so my bill comes up a little higher than most.  (Uni, mackerel, live shrimp, toro, fatty yellowtail etc). Gosh, I just got hungry all of a sudden.  Gotta get my eatin dress on and manja.  See you there.<//Text>< Pics>

Super average and overpriced. Sometimes you just need some fish for lunch though and you can't convince others to go someplace better.< /review>

The best deal for a quick bite on Haight Street. I personally like the $1.95 apple fritter, but you have to get there early to get one. I think they close at 5 PM because one time when I was visiting the place was empty and they turned the lights off. I got up and quietly left. They also have a number of breakfast and lunch-type sandwiches which I have never sampled but I've heard they are tasty.<//Text>

As we walked into the shop, the smell of burnt food filled the air.  Definitely made me not want to linger.  They were out of apple fritters, so we went with a croissant and a glazed donut. The donut was good, same as almost every glazed donut across the country, but the croissant had a sour milk taste to it.
I won't be back, the donut shop at 9th and Judah is a much better place (better selection, hours, atmosphere, and well, donuts like everywhere in America).< /Text>

<review>Not the cleanest spot, but their donuts are definitely great. Wouldn't recommend eating at the shop though as it is not the most cleanly or fresh smelling place.<//review>< user_name>

My old fashioned donut was quite good. The smoothie, however, was not. It was made with ice and some sort of pre blended fruit concoction. It didn't taste like much. I'm fact, the most prominent flavor was the plastic cup. Enjoy a donut here, but steer well clear of the smoothies.< /Review>

<text>I never write reviews. I message sam about my situation about my car, he was communicative, friendly, and gave me a quote. He has Reasonable Pricing compared to other auto glass shops. When arriving at Sam’s Auto, he greeted Me and welcomed me to his shop. He told me 1hr and 1 hr came along ,he was done. I have wirings on my windshield and  the components work as they should. Overall Sam’s Auto glass was fast and reasonable prices and Sam was friendly , communicative and Highly Recommend!!!</text>< username>

<review>Superior customer service, amazing price, same day service. If I could give more stars I would.

After having my passenger side window smashed when broken into, I called All Star Glass, who didn't have an appointment for 2 days. Tried Safelite bc, well, the commercials, and no appointment for a week. Called Sam's, and he called right back to tell me that yes he had the glass and quoted me a price that was less than HALF of what the other companies quoted. Headed over, no wait time, went and grabbed something to eat across the street, and by the time we were back, he was nearly finished. He cleaned out all the shattered glass, had great customer service skills, and was true to his word on the price! Sam takes precautions by only taking 4-5 clients/day maximum and none waiting at the same time. I've found my go-to shop for auto glass for myself, family, or friends.<//review><Response>None< /Response><rating>5<//rating><user_id>113067084233778783245</user_id><pics>None</pics>< Name>

<text>Man!  Sam is on top of it.  I had a last minute request to replace a broken side window on my 2007 Nissan and Sam was able to accommodate me with no complaints or hassles.  Skip the big corporations and go here.  He genuinely cares about the work and shows in his craftsmanship.  He will make sure you leave a satisfied customer.  There's a reason he's busy though, so you have to be patient, but he works fast and efficiently.</text><Name>Carlos C<//Name><GmapID>0x80dd29185ab0faa1:0x5769bb80a5b854e0< /GmapID>< user_id>

<review>My GMC Sierra windshield was leaking.  Sam gave an immediate quote and was able to complete the repair that same day.  He even had a particular windshield in mind that would work best with my car.  Excellent service and quality install.  While removing the old leaking windshield Sam pointed out the areas of a prior subpar install that resulted in the leaks.  He's been in the business, and same location, for a long time and is obviously very knowledgeable.  Would highly recommend him if you want a quality install.  Price is much cheaper than Safelite, which is an additional bonus.</review></record>

Brought my husband's car here after it was broken into. Other places quoted a new window for us between $209-270. We paid half that and the service is excellent. I made an appointment for noon but had a change of plans. I was able to bring the car in early and was taken care of immediately. I will be coming back here again if I ever need another replacement.<//text>

<Text>This place is GREAT!! Half the cost of what everyone else wanted to charge! Not only that, but he took us in earlier than we scheduled and Sam was friendly, professional, and very understanding of our situation! Hopefully I never will have need of his services again. If I do, he'll be the 1st one I call from now on!<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dd29185ab0faa1:0x5769bb80a5b854e0<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This man went out of his way to repair my windshield. He undercharged me in my opinion. So i gave him an extra 100 dollars. Even with that he was still 150 bellow safelite. Highly recommend.<//review>

Sam is very knowledgeable with power windows and he's not going to take advantage of you. At no cost he assisted me with my attempt to install my regulator on my 2006 Toyota Corolla by diagnosing the problem to determine whether it was the switch or the motor. Unfortunately, my part didn't arrive on time and I returned to Sam to handle the entire job. Great job and extremely polite.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>This is a hard working man, very professional & so absolutely kind! He exceeded my expectations. All of the reviews prior to mine are definitely true. He offers competitive prices that can't be beat in my opinion. I was about to spend $400 just to get my windshield replaced on a 2013 Nissan Altima until I found Mr. Sam. I sat and watched him work on a vehicle prior to mine and watched him work on my car... working carefully and skillfully. I'm glad I came here. He's just an all around nice guy. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! I'm grateful for your skills, thank you for your service and kindness again Mr. Sam! I will definitely return.

Add: And he gave me a LIFETIME WARRANTY! I love this man... yes, yes I do! And better glass quality...he explained to me the mistakes with my previous glass replacemt and I was devastated but I'm so glad he took the time to show me and fix it.

He is meticulous and has been doing this at the same location for over 20 years. I do a lot of freeway driving, so I've used him more than once. He is honest and fair.<//review>

<review>I've done ACLS and NPS courses at CalMed over the years and both experiences were great. The ACLS class was pre-COVID and it was fast and thorough. Mike and his staff are very efficient and knowledgeable in operating their classes. Post-COVID, they are still all of those things with cleanliness and safety to boot! Highly recommend.</review>< pictures>

I had a great experience with CPR 3G! The website was clear and easy to navigate to schedule my class. The communication from the instructors prior to the class was also very clear, organized and professional. The instructor was an absolute sweetheart and the quality of the class was very high. I would absolutely recommend these classes to anyone needing a certification.< /review>

<text>The class is long as expected but Mike makes it not boring. He goes straight to the point but yet teaches you valuable information for what you are going to use in the hospital setting. I will definitely continue coming here to renew my certifications.</text>< pictures>

Cal Med has the best instructors, their classes are second to none. They are professional and organized on every level. Mike makes his classes easy to understand and fun considering the length of the some of the courses. Margie is the best BLS instructor and treats her students like family. Both Mike and Margie are personable and kind. I’ve taken ACLS, BLS, PALS, NRP, ECG, and 12 Lead. I cannot recommend them enough!!<//Review>

Great place to get your certifications from. I've done the online virtual EKG and in person ACLS classes from them and have really enjoyed it. The instructor is awesome and has helpful mnemonics and stories.< /text>

<date>1617997004499</date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I found this school just doing research online and in comparison to others, I liked the fact that you would be able to take the national exam immediately after the program and at the site.
This program was so intense and accelerated it does help when you do the online portion as they request of you. I am in the medical field as a phlebotomist, and learning about the heart and blood flow, the foundation of EKG and Monitor tech was an eye opener, but Mike, the instructor is sooo cool and so laid back and so freaking knowledgeable and his teaching method is so easy to understand that you can't help but to soak up everything he has to offer. I came from Lancaster, CA and stayed in a hotel just to come here and it paid off.
Mike is such a good guy and an even better teacher. He has so much patience and although the class was accelerated he didn't rush the material. If there was something you didn't understand he just looked at your face, even while wearing a mask lol, he would ask you did you understand that and if not, he made sure he went over it again. CalMed Training Center was a GREAT INVESTMENT. I WOULD DO ANOTHER CLASS IF I HAD TO. I AM 100 PERCENT PRO 3G CALMED TRAINING.
YOU ARE AWESOME MIKE

I just passed my EKG Technician test thanks to Mike and Calmed Training. I drove an hour and a half to come here and I am so glad I did.

Mike is very patient and knows what he is talking about! The course is accelerated so do yourself a favor and do all online training, practice tests on the NHA portal and study your terminology as they recommend. If you do what they tell you it's pretty likely you will pass.

I appreciate the time and effort they put into every person there. They are taking COVID precautions and I felt totally safe.

Thanks again!<//text>

Amazing staff, I have taken the IV class and the CPR class too. Great prices and they responded quickly to my emails when I had questions . Even though it’s about 45 minutes from where I live in Lancaster, I rather come here. I will be taking more classes soon.</review>

I was impressed with my experience at CPR 3G. They  were recommended by a friend and the recommendation was deserved. The material was presented clearly and the instructor took time with everyone in the class to ensure understanding. Things moved along at a good pace and I was never bored. The price was less than I found at other places. There was easy and free parking. All in all I had a great experience. Sage is an awesome instructor.</Text>

Mike is a great teacher for me especially came from a different subject knowledge what I had, he displays evidence of his preparation for materials for the class are organized and adequate pacing on his teaching style due to a short program we need to complete.  He provides enrichment when he sees student needed his support. Because of all of his a great caring, kind and wanting all of us to do well on this program he went extra mile for students. This is an impressive quality that rare to find in today’s life. Trust me without his effort I would not think I would pass the national exam. Now, I have hope that I will have a better future what I had prior enter his program. Big thank YOU, wish you the best!!< /Review>

Having been a CNA for 2 years I was in search of something in the medical field that was different and challenging, that is when I reached out to California Medical Training Center.  The staff was quick to answer me back almost immediately and they were willing to answer any and all questions I had. I decided on sigingin up for the EKG Technician course, and I was not disappointed!! The instructor Mike was informative, innovated and enthusiastic, which made the class FUN!! He genuinely cares about his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed! I'm proud to say that I completed the course and am now a Certified EKG Technician.  I will definitely be taking other classes here in the near future and I confidently recommend California Medical Training Center to others in search of something awesome!<//text>

Outstanding and quality educational experience and training. If you are in Healthcare and need to update your certifications, THIS IS A GREAT PLACE to get your refreshers and on the spot CEU's.

If you want to be one certified and are getting into the health care system,  THIS IS THE PLACE.

California Medical Training uses a great concept of hybrid learning.  They use a pre-course  online syllabus, you get to take practice quizzes and practice test, which PREPARES YOU for the 1st day of class to the completion of class.

This concept makes you a success and helps you better understand the information which you have a great learning experience and gives you a high passing rate.

During the in class experience, the instructors are extremely passionate about their teaching and they are well versed on the latest trends in the course they teach.

They also use high quality videos, worksheets, and have the hands on equipment to cement the learning process and you, as a student, end up with really high scores.

Lastly, the instructors work with you on a 1 to 1 for clarification, explanations and demonstrations, before,  during and after class as well as via texts and emails.

Also, your certificates are READY at the end of the course or temporary certificates are provided until you get the official certificate from the issuing agency, depending on your course.

Overall I have taken 3 classes with California Medical Training and never have been disappointed. Also, the price for these classes are much more affordable and below the current rate as compared to other training programs.

These instructors have a vested interest in their students and in their success with their Healthcare Educational Goals.<//Text>

Great experience. David made the class light and entertaining. He was able to cater to everyone's level of ecg knowledge. He even took some time to explain some rhythms to a participant of the class who was not familiar with them.

I would gladly repeat the course with them again.<//Text>

All the instructors have been excellent with a firm caring manner getting the class to the goal of learning the material.  I also thank you-all for providing this service in the San Fernando Valley so I don't have to go far to get this done!<//Review>

I took his EKG course a couple of months ago and in that short period of time he thought me so many things.   It was challenging for me at first since I was transitioning from a different major which did not have any correlations with the health care system. However, he took his time to teach me step by step and made sure I was able to fully understand the course.  At the end of the course, I became Nationally Certified and left with a big smile on my face and ready to join the medical field. He left a great impression on me and I encourage others to join his courses as well.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

This company is awesome! Knowledgeable and friendly staff. I just LOVE how they're 3 generations of educators. That is a huge feat to be proud of. I most appreciated that I was able to renew both my ACLS, and my BLS in the same day. They have my business for as long as they exist! Thank you SO much for being SO phenomenal!</Review>

Took an ACLS class here last weekend. Plenty of parking which was great, no headaches about finding parking after our lunch break. The class was informative and fun. Justin, our instructor, made the class interesting also I didn’t feel stressed out like I usually do when we have to do megacode. It was great, I highly recommend them.< /text>

I want to start off by saying Mike is awesome. I learned so much in a short period of time and he had so much patience with me. I have passed my nationals and I owe it all to him. Great school they are known for having a high passing program. Will recommend to friends. Thanks again Mike!< /Review>

Venue and class size is very conducive for learning. Excellent materials for audio-visual and book learners. High professionalism of instructors. I just did my IV therapy and Blood Withdrawal Training with them and I am coming back on January 2019 for ACLS Training and certification. More power to my instructor and thank you!<//Text>

<text>I took ACLS for the first time here the class was great, but during it, David the instructor, touched on some ECG Dysrhythmia Interpretation items that literally made a light-bulb go off in my head.  The way he explained it I feel FINALLY made me understand.  I don't write a lot of reviews, but wanted to share this one because I truly appreciated this.  Great job!</text>< gmapID>

<Review>I traveled from Florida to Los Angeles, California to take three specific courses from California Medical Training Center: trach/vent, ABG interpretation, and airway management/modes of oxygenation. The trip was well worth it!!! All three courses were fantastic. The knowledge I gained from these courses has helped me tremendously in my job. I work as a speech-language pathologist in a hospital, where most of my patients have a tracheostomy tube in place and/or require ventilatory support. I needed formal instruction from an experienced respiratory therapist in order to better serve my patients with voicing and swallowing difficulties.  I didn't feel that these patients deserved to be neglected just because of my incompetence. So I signed up for these courses and flew across the state! Justin was my instructor for all three courses and was an excellent teacher. He's got a wealth of hands-on clinical experience and is very personable!!!! Mike, the owner, was also incredibly helpful and informative! I appreciated the time he took to share his clinical knowledge and expertise on speaking valves for trach/vent patients.Two weeks ago, I was able to safely place my first in-line speaking valve on a spinal cord injury patient requiring vent support. Because of this in-line speaking valve placement/trial, the patient had the opportunity to have a conversation with their kids for the first time in multiple months. Thankfully, this patient has been tolerating the in-line speaking valve during my therapy sessions with them over the past few weeks. And when the alarms sounded during placement and tracheo-bronchial suctioning, I knew how to troubleshoot! I also have many other trach/vent patients that are being seen sooner during their hospital stay due to knowledge Justin shared with me during the three courses. Thanks so much to California Medical Training Center for providing me with a wealth of much-needed trach/vent/pulmonary knowledge to help  better serve my patients with a tracheostomy tube and/or ventilator.</Review>< Pictures>

Amazing Instructor Nava, David for ACLS.He was entertaining and kept the class laughing the whole time. I learned alot from this class. He is a "Paramedic" so he comes across what he is teaching you on daily basis almost. He made it really simple to understand.< /Review>

<Text>I've been going here for years.  This is definitely the lowest stress BLS, ACLS, and PALS that I've ever taken.   I highly recommend them.  Even if you are the only person scheduled for a class, they will still have it for you.  They offer all the classes you need.  Check out their website.

11/2020 UPDATE
Even though there are COVID restrictions, Cal Med Training Center continues to give classes and does a wonderful job!  Instructors are great and make sure you understand.  I'll keep coming back!< /Text>< userid>

<Review>Decent wines but rather overpriced. $28-40 for reds and whites. Nice tasting room, friendly staff! $10 tasting is waved with 2 bottle purchase or 3 bottles of sparkling. We had the almond sparkling and left with a bottle.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0mgPvK02RPmBMCriNI2XP5PvKHsd-1JD2H_oT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOO_Y_TFT3rfWXP4DeYhsgldr25xCAWluRsRpiN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

The wine was superb, each with unique notes and combinations. I highly recommend doing dinner as well, the food was delicious, not too heavy and paired exquisitely with the wines. Not to mention, great service.</Review>

My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time!! The staff were so welcoming and nice I felt like I had been a regular for years instead of visiting there for the first time. I plan to come back here again and again and look forward to staying at the bed and breakfast when they open it!!

They were heads over heels a better wine tasting experience than the their more awarded neighbors up the street!!!<//text>

<Review>Always a pleasure to gather in the tasting room at Triassic with friends. The welcoming staff are accommodating and friendly meeting needs of guests. For the full Triassic experience I recommend taking advantage of outdoor seating on their wrap around covered patio. Sip away the day with a cheese platter and your favorite bottle while taking in an always impressive  Tehachapi sunset!< /Review><rate>5<//rate>< Response>

10/10 Recommend. The office is super nice and the staff is even nicer. They offer such a great breakdown of estimated costs pre and post insurance and map out a treatment plan from high to low priority levels. It’s a super comfortable environment and the staff is super supportive of any anxieties and frequently checked comfort level.I am very happy with the overall experience provided.

Incredibly professional and above average cleanliness & hygiene. Couldn’t recommend more.</review>

My first appointment at this location was a great experience. James who was at the frost desk is really nice his customer service was great I’ve visited other locations and let me tell you, first impressions are everything and he makes a very good one.

Dr. Tath really takes COVID-19 precautions seriously which I appreciate so much. The lobby has purifiers and mist that disinfects the area so I felt at ease, especially since he spaces out his appointments so only you are in the lobby.

Dr. Tath came out to greet me and showed me around the office while introducing himself which I appreciated it shows he cares.

I came went In today because of a toothache after I visited a different location in Tracy and so far he fixed the bite which alleviated some of the pressure I was having, I will follow is post visit instructions and fingers crossed it continues to feel better. I appreciate that he was able to fit me in so quick despite him being really busy because of my toothache, he explained everything so well and made me feel at ease with what will come next in my dental treatment.

I definitely recommend this location, you guys will not be disappointed!</review>

<Text>Mossdale Dental was one of the best dental offices I’ve encountered. Everything from the ambience, to the staff was remarkable. Dr. Tath truly cares about educating his patients and I felt like I was immediately apart of the family.

From the moment you enter their office you are well taken care of. Everyone is very friendly and sincerely caring. They have state of the art equipment and it really is a wonderful team of professionals. I hate going to the dentist but honestly out of more than 40 years this was the best experience I have ever had and I am extremely grateful for their care in my dental work. I had lost a very large filling and the tooth was so painful and they got me in within minutes and on a Saturday.< /Review>

Best dental experience I have ever had. They take advanced COVID precautions with high tech filters placed throughout the office. The receptionist is very friendly and the dental hygienist really took her time to explain everything. The dentist came out to the waiting room, sat down and took the time to talk with me and explain their enhanced precautions that they have implemented. He took me through a tour of the facility prior to my exam. The dentist thoroughly explained all steps of the exam. He was very gentle and made sure that I was comfortable throughout the whole appointment. He explained my treatment options and insurance coverage. I did not feel pressured to purchase additional treatment. I will definitely bring my entire family here. Highly recommend!<//Text>

This was my first visit. As a nervous Nellie about dentist visits, I was pleasantly surprised! Dr. That gave me a tour of his office and made me feel very at ease. He asked me about why I feel anxious about the dentist, which validated my concerns. Jocelyn and James were both very friendly as was Larisa. I highly recommend them and because of my experience, will continue to get the extensive work done that I need. 😊<//text>

I'm so grateful for Mossdale Dental for fixing my 7 year old son's chipped/scraped tooth. He fell face first onto cement. Thankfully he was ok. His tooth, not so much. Mossdale Dental was able to squeeze us in for an appt. As you can see from the after photo, Dr. Tath did an excellent job.</Review>

Wonderful Doctor and staff! One of a kind office! They are so caring and informative to not only adults but little ones too. My 6 year old has only had 2 appointments, one being a big procedure for a little kid and she already feels like part of their office family. Highly recommend them!</review>

I took my two kids (4 and 6) to this dental office for the first time yesterday. Many precautions were in place to provide a sanitary environment. The staff was very friendly and Dr. Tath gave helpful advice on how to encourage and provide good oral hygiene for the kids. My only issue is that the appointment took 1.5-2 hours when my kids are used to 30-45 min. We spent some time meeting with the dentist and touring the facility which could have probably been done virtually beforehand to shorten the time. Also, each child was seen separately in the same exam room so they had to switch off, but this was probably a precaution to minimize potential contamination with other rooms. I’m guessing future appointments will be shorter since this was our very first time there. I’d like to add that the staff was very understanding and helpful when my 4 year old started to melt down and thus, a full blown meltdown was avoided =)</Review>

I finally found the perfect dentist. First of all, it’s fancy. New, clean, well lit, and feelin like VIP with the free drinks. About 24 years ago, my mom took me to a dentist with a high tech X-ray where you bite into this little rod it scans. No plates. I since then longed for a dentist as high tech as that place. This place is just that but up to date and more!!!! They got HEPA filters (great for my allergies) and humidifier that cleans the air naturally. Dentist office heaven. Dr. Tath is amazing. He’s my kind of provider because he explains, educates,  and walks you through procedures. He’s also patient. My daughter (in the pic looking cute with her eye protector they provided) hated the idea to go see a dentist and super anxious to go. The staff (also amazing and friendly) did a great job breaking her in. You would never guess in the picture she was nervous  eye protector. She now loves the idea of going to the dentist. Love this place< /Text>

I really enjoyed my experience at Mossdale dental. Everyone working there was kind and friendly. They explained all of the procedures to me before, during, and after and made sure that I was both informed and comfortable. They even had a TV and allowed me to choose a movie to watch while having my teeth worked on :). I will definitely be returning to them in the future.<//review>

I’m usually nervous to go to the dentist but Dr. Pon Tath and his staff reassured me on all of my worries and let me know of all options I had in regards to my Dental Heath Plan. Definitely will keep going here and will be recommending to family and friends!<//text>

I am very leary of dentist.  So needless to say, I delayed to go do my much needed checkups and held off for as long as I  could. Well the road  met the rubber and I could not hold off any more so  I began searching around and afterreading various reviews decided to go with mossdale dental.  I  am proud to say that my faith in dentists have been restored the staff and Dr Taft at mossdale dental  are phenomenal beings.  From the first phone call all my questions were answered in a professional yet friendly manner, the office is super clean and  Everyone is courteous. I will highly recommend this dental office and you can thank me later for writing my review. I have a course of treatments to do but so far those that I have done has been pain free, if you're on the fence deciding where to go, please give Mossdale Dental a try.<//text>

During this “COVID” time I am nervous and scared to go anywhere. This time I had no choice, I haven’t slept well in 3 days due to constant pain from my wisdom tooth. I needed to be seen. I heard about Mossdale Dental through friends and figured I’ll give them a try. First off they stagger your appointment quite well. So you’re the only one in the waiting room. While in the waiting room there are 3 air filtration/purification/sanitizing devices on at all times. Dr. Tath came out to great me and gave me a tour of the facility. When you’re in the room there is another purifier running! Well turns out I needed my wisdom tooth extracted. Dr. Tath and team is very calming, welcoming, knowledgeable, courteous. There was no pain or discomfort during the whole procedure! The experience was fantastic and will definitely recommend Mossdale Dental to my family and friends.< /text>

Today was my first visit but won’t be my last. I’m so happy I found Mossdale Dental. Dr Tath and all of his staff were extremely friendly. They explained everything they would be doing before it was done. This calmed my nervousness & anxiety very much. They answered all my questions & made me feel very comfortable.

The facility is very clean & comfortable. I was given a tour of the facility and I appreciated that SO much. They are going above & beyond to keep the staff as well as patients safe during this covid time. They have a great system of spacing patients as to not cross with anyone else. This was great.

I will be recommending this office to all of my friends & family. I will also be bringing my young daughter in next.

If you live in the Lathrop area you definitely need to come to this dentist. They are wonderful.<//Review>

My experience at Mossdale Dental exceeded my expectations. As a new patient, Dr. Tath and his staff were both welcoming and friendly. The staff takes all necessary precautions to ensure my safety during this pandemic. There is a check-in process in which my temperature was taken and a mask was provided.

I’ve been to multiple dentists prior to Mossdale Dental. Dr. Tath has been the only dentist who takes his time to thoroughly explain each of my procedures and why it was needed. He made his explanations easy for me to understand which allowed me to feel more comfortable as a patient. I highly recommend seeking Dr. Tath and Mossdale Dental for any dental related needs.</text>

If I could give more than 5 stars, I definitely would. It gives me great relief that I’ve finally found a dentist that is more than qualified in their field (with over 15 years of experience). Dr. Tath and his staff exceeded my expectations — from their preventive safety measures against COVID to their state-of-the-art equipment and machineries. Dr. Tath thoroughly explained what he was doing, which made me feel very comfortable and at ease knowing what was going on at all times. The professionalism and friendliness I experienced just on my first visit assured me that I was in good hands with Dr. Tath and his staff. Highly recommend!< /Review>

I came in for a routine checkup and cleaning. With the whole Covid thing, it's been well over 6 months since my last dentist visit. Needless to say, my teeth needed some TLC. The office was everything I'd expect from a brand new office - clean, updated, etc. The staff was friendly and it was very apparent that they are following the Covid guidelines which made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. Dr. Tath was friendly and didn't shame me for having neglected my teeth for some time :-). Conversation seemed to flow naturally with him rather than seem like a forced one. Will definitely be taking my husband here for his upcoming checkup.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I was having a terrible toothache and gum swelling for 3 days and my dentist’s office was closed for the holiday until that Monday.

I looked online for an open dental office and called 3; 2 were prompters, and 1, a real person on the other line. This was Mossdale Dental.

James, the front desk person, took my call and in a few minutes, put me down for an appointment after lunch. A few minutes after, James called to let me know they would be able to see me in the morning. What a great relief!
James exerted all effort to get me in to the clinic as fast as he could, inspite of him being very busy.
He was sincerely helpful, very efficient, kind, and pleasant. He’s the  perfect person in the front desk.
Amanda, the dental assistant was so nice, skilled, pleasant, gentle and kind. She did imaging of my mouth using a high-tech machine.
Dr. Tath, the equally sincerely helpful, very professional, kind dentist, explained my dental issues, gave me prescription for antibiotics, and how he would eventually fix the problem.
What a relief! I’m soo grateful!!
They also have a program which is cost effective for people who have no insurance.
I was blessed to have been seen by this clinic. I will follow up with them in 2 weeks.< /Review>< pics>

Best Dental place in Lathrop/Manteca area, Interior office of the building very high class and has that modern welcoming of new patients/old patients. You get to watch Disney + and enjoy some sparking water while you wait to go in, they even let me watch it while I was waiting for the doctor in the operating room which I thought was pretty cool. Staff there is super friendly and professional, Helps me overcome my dental phobias. Dr Tath is very good at what he does, made my first wisdom tooth removal  less scary than I thought it would be like. They take great precautionary measures for Covid and makes me feel more safe during my visits. Found my new go to Dental office.<//Text>

< review>
I called Mossdale Dental about excruciating pain in my tooth. I was very skeptical about trying out a new dentist due to the pandemic as well as being 20 weeks pregnant. His staff encouraged me to be seen and I’m glad that I did! I appreciate all of the precautions that they are taking to ensure the safety of their patients during the pandemic but also the extreme measures they take when caring for a pregnant patient. I ended up needing an extraction and root canal. I experienced quite a bit of anxiety just before the procedure started but I’m so thankful for the kindness and patience of Dr. Tath and his staff. They were extremely compassionate and ensured me that things would be okay- followed by personal check ins to make sure that I was recovering properly. Thank you all!</review>

< Review>
I have not seen a dentist over 5 years due to my fear and embarrassment of my teeth. I'm the type of person who would avoid seeing one unless I was in great pain but that changed thanks to Mossdale Dental. After my experience at Mossdale, I felt the need to write a review because he changed my perspective on Dentists. I came in for a check up and cleaning. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted nicely by the team. I was able to get a tour and was amazed how neatly and clean the set up was. I explained to Dr.Tath how nervous I was and he completely understood. He was very patient with me. He walked me through each procedure and made sure I was comfortable. What amazed me most was being able to see what he was doing to my teeth on the screen. I was able to see which teeth had cavities which made me trust him more as a dentist. The previous dentists I've had pressured me into getting work done and didn't thoroughly explain why I needed those procedures. Dr. Tath is truly honest with his work. I did not feel pressured to get work done and loved how I did not need the laughing gas. I could honestly say I am not as nervous as I used to be and would definitely recommend him to friends and family. Thank you Mossdale Dental for making me feel like I could trust you guys and being so kind. Dr.Tath has an amazing team and is very knowledgeable. Thank you for educating me through the procedure. I enjoyed learning about dental care and had a great experience. Definitely recommend!<//Review>

From the Complimentary water and drinks from the fridge to the Netflix and chill while you wait your turn. This place really gave that comfortable vibe. If you had any health and safety concerns,(Covid-19). Each room is equipped with a Medify Airfilter to filter and clean the air to the smallest microbe constantly. The Office was kept clean and organized. As for the staff everyone was very professional and friendly. My visit here was fast and the procedure for my cleaning was done before I know it. Over all I enjoyed my experience at this wonderful Dental Office. Great environment, Great service and Great Professionals. 10/10 that is why I’m rating this place a 5 star.</Text>< pics>

I always get good service when i go in. It was the service i got over the phone when i called that my order wasn't right. That is what made me not want to return back. To be told that i was  Lying about the my order being wrong even when i had the receipt to prove  it.  She needs more training on customers can be right!!<//Review>

<text>Every time I have attempted to buy a Pizza here.... No Pizza, what is the point of Fresh and Ready if the pizza is neither fresh nor ready.

<Gmap_id>0x80c2d0acff0dec15:0x1ea97e92bbe481c0< /Gmap_id><review>Piara pizza is actually the best pizza around el monte. It has competitive prices such as a $5 large pepperoni and family specials. The down side is that they do not deliver, however, they did inform me that you can now get delivery through Grub hub. The veggie pizza is actually my favorite and the wings are pretty good too. The el monte trolley, foothills 190, Metro 488 and 270 all pass by the shopping plaza where Piara Pizza is located.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Usually have no problem ordering food here. But when you order something on the menu and literally show the pic of what your ordering. Get back something you didn't order and they look at you and say thats what you ordered after waiting 20 minutes. I will think twice before coming back here. The staff on this shift is terrible and very rude!!!!!<//text><resp>{'time': 1511920135084, 'text': 'Hi Frank, I\'m very sorry to hear about your experience at our El Monte store.

We are first time home buyers and Sharon was the best teammate!! She explained everything and knew the dynamics of the whole process - she would explain and explain time and time again until we understood. She had great energy and made the process seem easy! Sharon was attentive and really made us feel like we were her priority! I 100% without a doubt do not think this would have been possible without her - my anxiety and stress would have been off the charts and I would have given up. Sharon was absolutely wonderful - after closing I called her and asked if we were breaking up I was so used to talking to her every day (and her telling me how to financially be responsible) I felt like I was losing a life coach or something.< /Review>

I reached out to Eric back in November based on my Mom’s referral. Come to find out Eric has helped my cousin and aunt too. From the beginning Eric was always very friendly and answered all of my questions without making me feel like I was asking too many questions! It took us about 6 months before we found our first home and Eric was helpful and responsive the whole time. He helped us throughout those six months figure out the best ways to maximize our budget. Once we got into Escrow, Eric and his team continued to be responsive to all of my questions. Eric really worked for us and with us throughout the entire process. We would definitely work with and recommend Eric to all of our family and friends!</review>

<Text>Hadia is the best at what she does. She went above and beyond. Being a first time home buyer with her experience and knowledge it made the process very pleasant. She walked me through every step and was there to answer any questions I had. She knows the ins and outs of this business and does what it takes close the deal.

I’m a first time home buyer and the experience with Karol my loan officer was outstanding. She was very detailed and professional at all times. she explained everything I had to sign and broke in down so I would fully understand it. Karol and her team made our dream come true to own our home even through the end of this pandemic. Thanks again Karol for your dedication and professionalism.< /Text>

Nickolas Masses is an excellent broker. We used his services during the loan process for our first home purchase. He was knowledgable; communicated step by step information. He was very professional, answering questions via email, text and phone calls. He made the process orderly and productive.</review>

<review>With the diligent assistance of the Alameda Mortgage staff and my tenacity, I was able to refinance my home in 30 days.  The process was seamless and easy to follow along as I was provided with a check-list of items needed to help me through the process.  I followed my Loan Processor, Caleb Berry, to this company because of his work ethic, kind spirit and knowledge to help me reach my goals.  I've purchased my home now for the fourth time and worked with him each time.  Him and his Loan Officer Assistance, Ana Dominguez, are amazing!  I highly recommend them and their company to anyone looking to purchase or refinance.<//review>< username>

We worked with Tonya Dennett to purchase out first home ever! Tonya worked tirelessly to help us get pre-approved for the loan we needed to compete in this brutal seller's market. My worst fear was underwriting, and thanks to Tonya's knowledge and organization, we were able to move through underwriting very quickly. I would recommend Tonya to anyone looking to purchase a home.<//Text>

We had a long, drawn out refi, and she stuck with us until the successful finale. She knows her stuff and checked in with us in a timely manner to make sure this convoluted process ran as smoothly as it possibly can.

Sharon was great to work with.  She counseled me on how to bring my credit score up for a possible better finance rate, and it worked.   She also educated me the importance of a conventional loan verses a FHA.  We are so happy we chose and qualified for a conventional.  Sharon was very easy to work with and very genuine.  Thank you Sharon, this was our most important purchase of our lives, and you did it for us.  Also, thank you Team Alameda Mortgage!<//Text>

Provided great customer service. Hadia and Karol work around the clock to make our home ownership dream a REALITY. They provided advice and explained every step of the process from beginning to end. They also assisted us  with improving our credit score. Through their contacts with credit repair providers, it  helped us secure a GREAT interest rate. These two went above and beyond our expectations. We will definitely be contacting them in the future for our next purchase. Thank you Hadia and Karol for all your hard work.

Eric with Alameda Mortgage Company was truly outstanding. This was my first time buying a house and I had no idea what I was doing. Eric was very supportive at each step. So pleasant and understanding! If I could give a 20/10 I would.<//review>

She actually made what is a normally stressful experience into a very fun and pleasant one.  I contacted 3 other lenders weeks before meeting Hadia and she had me pre-approved before they even got back to me. That speaks volumes about her work ethic.  She is incredible.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

My wife and I are truly grateful to have worked with such an amazing team that provided an exceptional experience through the purchasing process. The whole team was knowledgeable and communicated with us every step of the way, which far exceeded our expectations. Did I mention competitive rates? It’s a no brainer. Work with a Lender that cares about YOU and truly wants the best for YOU! Huge thank you to Alameda Mortgage! Now our dream home, is home sweet home!<//text>

Joe has made a normally frustrating refinance into a VERY pleasant experience.  He snd his team gave their 100%; emailing me the exact documentation required, providing status of my completions, and status of my loan processing.  Even with this pandemic my refi completed in less than a month.  BTW, he always returned my calls within a day to address any questions. I will definitely use him again!</review>

This is the second time I've had the benefit of Eric Geli's expertise and proficiency to guide me through the refinance process. Both times the experience has been efficient, professional and communicative. Do you ever sleep Eric, haha?

As a realtor, loan is always the key to closing a deal.  Eric Geli, gets the job done every time.  He is the ultimate professional, returns phone calls, text messages.  He understands the timeline, and makes himself particularly available in the critical week leading to ordering loan documents for signing and eventual closing. Does justice to the borrowers, and makes agents confident and able to focus on other contract matters.  Thank you Eric!<//Review>

Alameda Mortgage Corporation is great. We are first time home buyers and they always made sure to keep us up to date. They also went over the home buying process in detail. They have great communication and genuinely care about the customer. I would highly recommend them. Also, a special shout out to Kaelen! She is so patient and kind.</review>

I have refinanced many times over the years, with banks, brokers and once online for the “lowest rate”. I have never had such an easy or smooth transaction as I did with Nick. I got the lowest rate and he did all the work. He handled any issues and questions and worked constantly.  Absolutely incredible.  I would recommend him every time.</Text>

My husband and I have had the pleasure of working with Luis through two (2) refinances, and each time remains as professional and thorough as the first.  Luis always keeps up-to-date on the refi status, as well as explaining (via email or phone) any and all questions that arise.  Simply put, this is the right company with which to do business!!!< /review>

<Text>If you’re looking to choose a loan officer I’d recommend Luis. He was able to execute the loan process in a timely manner. I’m happy with the work he put to make sure I was receiving the best loan. Luis was amazing. I would recommend Luis to my family and friends.< /Text></record>

I had 2 great experiences with Joe and the staff at Alameda Mortgage.  i used them for my 1st home purchase and my refi.  In both cases, Joe went above and beyond to make sure we got the best possible deal for our family and got the job done in a timely manner.  I will continue to use and recommend Joe and Alameda mortgage to anyone looking for mortgage assistance.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I am a returning customer! Few years ago Kaelen and her team assisted me in refinancing my house. Recently I had to go through divorce and part of it were the common properties and the house being part of it. Due to the nature of the circumstances, all being fluid, for more than a year we could not settle on the house; from purchasing the other party’s share to selling the property in midst of children's schools and pandemic but at no part Kaelen and her team lost focus on providing their best consultations! It is one thing to close escrow less than 2 weeks, but it is a whole different ball game when they do it over and over and at the very last step parties don't come to agreement! Even after both parties, my wife and I, settled on the method of the settlement, I was faced with properties having their HOA in litigation and again Kaelen and her team gave me the best advises! Not only Kaelen and her team supported me professionally in their field of profession but also mentally knowing this is not just a financial deal but also it is an investment that impacts the children’s future. Finally when there was an acceptable offer on the house, I had very little time to sell, move and settle in a new house and Kaelen and her team closed yet another deal for me and my children within just two weeks time! I highly recommend Kaelen Cavalli, Deanna Schmidt and Madelyne Kulak!</Text>< Pics>

We were not sure how our experience was going to be considering we were under shelter in place due to the COVID19 pandemic, and with being an essential worker. But, Eric and his team did an excellent job being very transparent and kept us in the loop with the progress and process of the transfer of ownership and refinance.  We are very content with our experience. We felt more like family than just clients.</review>

Very professional group who did everything they said they would.  When other companies were telling us it would take 60 days for a refinance, Kaelen and her team told us 30 days and delivered.  Never had a mortgage group check in with us so frequently throughout the process.  Highly recommend team KD for any mortgage needs.<//text>

This is my second transaction with Charles and it was again a pleasure working with him. His communication at every step of the lending process was very appreciated because as a Realtor or as a buyer I s very important to know the status of the loan approval process to make sure that the milestones in the purchase contract are timely reached, but besides that, Charles has a way to make things happen and a disposition to resolve the inevitable hurdles along the process that very few lenders have.
I’d recommend to work with Charles to my fellow Brokers and agents, and will recommend my clients to talk with him for their lending needs. A 10 star service overall for sure!<//text>

This was my first time buying a home and I have to admit, it was a roller coaster of an experience, but thanks to my loan officer David Valencia, I was prepared for everything that we encountered. He educated us on the entire process before going into escrow and throughout the process we were kept updated! Me and my family are extremely grateful and blessed to be in our new home thanks to his great work!<//Review>

Luis Carrera is the best in the business. He has successfully closed several loans for my family and I. We often have complicated and unusual aspects to our loans, and Luis handles it all quickly, professionally, and with a friendly attitude. Most of all, we always shop for the best deal, and he helps us get a great rate and keeps fees low, beating the competition every time! Five stars!<//Review>

Joe Trippy and his team are the best. He's our go to guy in real estate lending bar none. If you want to close see Joe at Alameda Mortgage. He will always be our first call for those who need a lender who cares about your home purchase or refinance.</review>

<Text>We worked with Luis Carrera at Alameda Mortgage Company. This is our second time working with Luis for a reason. He's fast, efficient, knowledgeable, and professional. We never had to check in with him because he's communicative and attentive. When you're under time constraints and dealing with large amounts of money you want someone who knows the business and that you can trust. Luis was that person for us. Writing this review is as easy as our transaction with Luis at Alameda Mortgage Company.</Text>< name>

My experience with Luis Carrera and Alameda Mortgage was excellent. I was a first time home buyer and Luis was happy to break things down for me and help me throughout the process.

Months after closing, I reached out with a question about my supplemental tax bill. He researched my question and got back to me right away.

Overall, a positive experience in every way!

Update:
About a year after my first time working with Luis, he reached out with an offer to refinance my mortgage, for free!

The second time working with Luis and his team were just a great as the first. His communication is top notch, and he is always happy to explain anything. He is a great person to have on your side!< /review>

<user>101640378151834964890</user><Review>I am so grateful to Luis C.  and his team, they did an amazing job getting me my house.  We closed in 17 days as promised despite obstacles and difficulties that kept popping up daily. Luis stayed on top of my account and communicated daily with me on how we were doing, how to solve the issues and constantly reassuring me we could work around them.  I know for sure if I had not had Luis and Alameda Mortgage I would not have been able to secure the loan for my house.  I would definitely return to them in the future should I need to refinance and I would recommend him and his team to anyone looking to buy. Thank you Luis, you made a very stressful process manageable and your constant communication kept me positive and Hopeful. I got my keys last night!!!! I am so happy. I double the 5⭐️S for you.<//Review><gmapID>0x808f8cb4c72d92d1:0x6dec18f2f64679e< /gmapID><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

He explained everything from start to finish, kept in constant contact with me through each step and is just an all around professional and great guy!

We had a great experience with Alameda Mortgage thanks to Eric Geli. He is awesome at what he does, I honestly don’t think I could have had a better experience with any other mortgage place. Eric is very knowledgeable, and responded to all my phone calls, and emails in a timely manner, always got back to me within a hour of me contacting him, which really calmed my nerves because we all know how nerve wrecking the home buying process is. THANKS AGAIN TO ERIC GELI AND HIS TEAM AT ALAMEDA MORTGAGE!!!</Text>

He explains your options, walks you through the deal and always has your best interest. Looking forward to working with Luis C. Again in the near future.<//text>

< Review>
Alameda Mortgage Corporation (AMC) is great organization. Employees of AMC go the extra mile to help customers. For example, AMC employees provided a list of correct documents in order to process our mortgage application. They got our 30 year fixed rate mortgage approved and we got the money within 2 weeks.

I will strongly and wholeheartedly recommend Alameda Mortgage Corporation to my friends.< /Review>

<review>When I started entertaining the process of purchasing my first home, I didn't know what to expect.  David Valencia was a huge part of the reason I started to actually believe I could buy.  With his help, I went from being unqualified to being able to purchase exactly what we wanted! I have nothing be great things to say about David's willingness to help me even though I wasn't in the greatest position starting off, he helped me get to where I needed to be, and now I'm a homeowner!!</review>< Rating>

I was going into this purchase with very little expectations due to being on medical leave at the moment.  My mother and I were extremely shocked to see that even with my employment situation, David Valencia was able to get us approved and closed on my first home!  We couldn't be happier with his expertise and the way he kept us involved and updated throughout the entire process!  I can't wait to refer him all my friends and family!</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I am praying the two other people that starred the same were able to finally have their dream for their family. I have been under so much stress for just about 45 days and still haven’t closed. The sellers put our house on the market last night because no one would respond to them. Even though we may have 3 days left, I am pleading with this company please finalize my paperwork so my children and I can have our sanity and dreams. This is an exhausting process and 28 days to close is now 45 that is if we do close and they live up to the agreement of the approval letters. I have never done this before but I can’t get through to someone that can help finalize this process and it’s mothers day weekend and we will be homeless next week.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I had been told I had to wait another 6 months to purchase a home.  My realtor finally asked me to meet with David Valencia and he found a way for us to purchase a home with 0% down and we didn't even have to pay for our closing costs!!  My wife and two kids now have a home to call our own and we couldn't be happier!</Review>

My husband and I have been shopping for a home for over two years. After two years of searching for that perfect home, Luis Carrera, Branch Manager at AMC was on top of all the things that were needed to get done and accessible when we had questions or clarifications that were needed for the us to be the official owners of the home. Luis got us all good options for our home loan to choose from and he really had a vested interest in helping us through this process. The goal was to have a 14 day close, and with the assistance and guidance of Luis we were able to close in 8 days. . . that is just amazingly fast!  If you are looking for a loan officer who is knowledgeable, honest, and accessible, and most importantly family-oriented . . .Luis Carrera is the person you want to work with.  Thank you Luis!!<//text>

<Text>I am a Realtor in Northern California and my client coordinated her loan utilizing the services of Mr. Kevin Bernal of Alameda Mortgage Corporation (AMC). This was the first time I had ever heard of or had any dealings with AMC. I have worked with many Mortgage companies with many different clients and AMC was extremely easy, pleasant and extremely professional to deal with and it was a direct result of Kevins' demeanor and professionalism. He went well beyond both my clients' and my expectations with his prompt 5 star service. Have no doubts about whether or not you should choose AMC for your mortgage needs. The answer is YES and if you get the results we recieved then you surely will have no regrets. TOP NOTCH.< /Text><rate>5</rate>< UserId.>

As a first time home buyer, I had many questions regarding the home buying process and finding a lender who best suited my needs. I had the pleasure of speaking with R.J at AMC, who was such a huge help in answering all of my questions and guiding me towards making the right steps in my home buying journey. 5 stars!< /Review>

<review>We just finance thru Luis Carrera and what a great experience we had. We were buying a home in Paradise Ca and were closing on the day of the Paradise fire that, went thru our town.  It took a bunch to get this purchase to go thru since so much  has happened due to the fire.  The house was still standing and Luis would say it will be alright. We will get it done. Luis was there all the way. He is a fighter.  He will roll his sleeves up and get it done.
Awesome experience.  His  professionalism is great.  Wouldn't have anybody else.</review>< username>

<text>My first house purchase... disaster!  They are not on top of their game. Too many mistakes in the numbers, agreements and etc that resulted in shelling out more money on my end for the closing cost.

Save your sanity and shop around for another company, I'm pretty sure there are some good ones out there.< /text>< Rate>

<text>Alemeda mortgage? Absolutely great. If i could add a star I would.

My husband and I had a very challenging re-fi, and were on the re-bound from an absolutely horrible experience with one of the big banks (rhymes with Belle's Cargo?). It wasn't easy, but the team (Steve Goodell, Gary Alcantara, and Jennifer Perez among others) at Alameda not only got it done, but were attentive, professional, and "can do" every step of the way. Every question, concern, and problem was promptly and thoroughly dealt with.

The above mentioned individuals really do function like a well practiced and motivated team, but we would like to give a special thanks to Gary Alcantara. A great guy and a pleasure to work with start to finish. Thanks Gary!</text>< userid>
