The service is always great here, the staff is wonderful. Food is always fresh and delicious. I love the Eggplant Parmigiana. Atmosphere is nice, I love hearing Dean Martin songs playing in the background!</review>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>It was decided to try this Italian restaurant a new experience. The service was excellent very friendly and attentive. The resturant food was very clean with soft music playing the background very romantic atmosphere. The food was amazing you could taste the fresh pasta and ingredients. The garlic butter bread could of used more garlic. The desert tiramisu was delicious creamy not to sweet with a hint of coffee. This is worth another visit.</review>< Pictures>

If you did not want us there you should have said something from the beginning and not had us wait 10 minutes just to be told to leave. We weren't even given an option.  We were literally told to leave and exit the restaurant (we had been sitting in the chairs in the waiting area). I will no longer spend my money here.</Review>< pics>

I had the trio platter. Everything was good but the meat lasagna was excellent.
The wife had pesto crusted chicken. I don't like pesto, but it looked so good I almost wanted to try it. She said it was excellent.</text>< pics>

<username>Jay Bevans<//username><text>The people there are very friendly. The service was not bad but the food was not so great. The pasta was terribly under seasoned, the meat balls taste store bought and the spinach artichoke dip was disgusting. We did like the meat sauce and the fettuccine, those were pretty good. It sucks the food was subpar because it smells amazing.

Smells wonderful upon arrival. Service was very poor. The server kept walking away while we were trying to order things. You could tell they didn't want to be there. We sat in the back and from there I could see the kitchen counter. I saw open cans of Campbells cream of mushroom soup. This was very discouraging. The calamari appetizers taste like they came straight from a bag. Flavors of main dishes were bland and tasted like they were heated in a microwave. Best thing here is the pizza, it was fair. We will not be returning.< /review>

We went today for mothers day and my family came all the way down from Anaheim to eat at this place and they tell us we can't eat there cause our party was to big and when I asked to sit us in 2 separate tables they still said no but hey there was a big group of American people and they got to walk right in .

Farfalla's is a true gem of a restaurant!   You are missing out if you've never eaten at Farfalla's. The food is delicious with generous portions.  The prices are reasonable.  The daily specials are a treat!  The service is friendly and professional.  We don't have a favorite dish because everything we've eaten at Farfalla's is absolutely delicious.
We're always full from dinner so we haven't tried the desserts yet.  One day we'll start out with dessert first!<//review>

<text>Delicious food, very reasonable prices, great garlic bread and salads. Family owned with great service and homemade/authentic food. We had manicotti, lasagna and chicken parmigana...we purchased side salads and garlic bread for a measly extra $3.50 each and they were large portions and delicious.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< time>

<text>I was born, and bred on Italian food. My grandma's food is the best Italian food in the world! But when I am craving Italian and it's not a Sunday afternoon, I come here. I cannot stress enough, this food is amazing. They not only have very generous portions but their red sauce is out of this world. Their lasagna is to die for (something that I rarely say about lasagna) and my husband loves their Chicken Alfredo. I have ordered from here and number of times and they have not disappointed me yet. Please give them a try for amazing Italian food. If I could give more stars I would.</text>< Pics>

This place is hidden gem!!
We ordered 4 different dishes for our group, every single was really good.
The mushroom soup was mind blowing good.
Their service is decent and food didn't take long to prepare since they prepare everything from scratch.
This is definitely a repeater when we crave some Italian food.
Good job chef!!</review>

I have always been impressed with Falfallas in Riverside. I have dined in, as well as ordered take-out. It is an exceptional restaurant . The food has been exceptional and the staff is outstanding. I typically order bow-tie pasta with alfredo sauce, caesar salad, and toasted bread.
I have also ordered the baked ziti, pizza, and lasagna. Those are note-worthy, as well.
Go there ..See for yourself!!!

First time visiting carry-out due to Covid. I ordered the french bread and sampler from the appetizer menu. Food was really good. Other customers that were there waiting for their orders were regulars and they had nothing but wonderful things to say about this place.  Can't wait to come back for a dine-in experience.<//review>

I've worked in this area for going on three years and never knew about this place. I went there for lunch worth a friend who goes there all the time and it was really good.

The waitress was nice, evening was made fresh and had great taste. I will definitely be going back.< /Review>

We love both the excellent food and service at Farfalla's. They take such good care of our larger parties and small, juggling our never ending needs.  Juanita and the group treat us like family and we truly appreciate the Farfalla's group going out of their way to accommodate us. Lovely atmosphere.< /text>

If you want microwaved BS fast served to you try a gross chain restaurant. The beer is cold and the food is delicious.

One of my preferred locations for delicious italian food. I had a brother come into town and he asked me to go back here. Prices that won't shock you. Food is similar to a place in San Francisco I liked.< /Review>

<text>Boy am I stuffed. It was the husband's idea to get all you can eat pasta and sauce and now I'm miserable. I'm only miserable because the food is so good. I couldn't stop putting it in my face. Four different kinds of pasta with four different kinds of sauce. SO AMAZING!!!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Great service. The male waiter was very attentive checked on us about 4 times during our meal and was on top of our tables requests and very polite. Pasta was cooked to the right tenderness i live pasta so im a bit picky about it could use a few more seasoning to add a bit more flavor but all you can eat pasta for 10 bucks is a great deal and definitely a great steal. Would recommend</review>

Great Italian food, great atmosphere.  I go there often with my father.  The baked dishes like Chicken Alfredo are amazing.  My father loves their Calzones.  The owners are very nice people, great service.  I like going to a family owned restaurant instead of a chain.<//Text>

<Text>This place never fails us! You will almost always be seated within a couple minutes. It is family owned and the staff is friendly. The food is great. They are willing to accommodate special requests. The serving size is perfect, and the prices are very competitive. This is a fantastic option for holidays when the other restaurants have 1-2 hour waits. Highly recommended.</Text><Name>Greg Short</Name><Response>None</Response>< Time>

This is one place my mom and i love to come the place is always so clean which is something i notice right away. The food is always fresh and salads are amazing. Reasonable prices. I gave it 4 stars because there is  one waitress that needs a refresher course on customer service.< /text>

< review>
This seems like a family owned restaurant service, prices and quality were all top notch! Large portions in a comfortable atmosphere. We will definitely be back. I had the best calzone ever there. Not too heavy on the bread, great filling. Did I say the bread was very good? It was great. My friend had the shrimp fettuccine alfredo. The home made sauce was also very good and the shrimp were fresh. They have a large room in the back for banquets and such. The service was friendly and had the light touch I prefer.</review>

Farfalla's is extremely good. The woman who's always there is very nice. I love this place. Of all the Italian places in Riverside I choose this as my favorite. I try to make it there at least once a week if possible. The pasta plates are wonderful.< /review>

Very friendly staff. Clean and decent size rooms. Big TV. All a business traveler needs. Also had a huge couch in the room. Stayed here for 1 night for a business meeting. The free breakfast was pretty good too. Parking is easy, I just don't like that it's along a semi-busy street. Oh well.</review>

Ate there last night at 5 p.m. Strawberry lemonade had a good 2 inches of strawberry sludge at bottom of glass. Undrinkable. Lasagna had ZERO CHEESE : layers of noodles and greasy thin meat/tomato sauce, then topped with some mozzarella. UGH!! Pizza had great toppings, but the crust was hard as a rock, like cardboard..... inedible. I couldn't even cut it with a knife, let alone bite through it.  Never again. Been there before and had better food. What a shame .</review>

3 5 stars
Came here for lunch on a Friday. Pretty slow. Service was fine. Only thing I'd say about the server is that he never returned to check how we thought our food was mid-meal.
Meatball sandwich with fries was ok. Taste of MBs are not traditional flavor.
I had the eggplant parm with side of spaghetti. Considering the dish was eggplant; it can with the ring slices of eggplant and the whole plate of pasta vs the other way around. The breading & flavor of the eggplant wasn't good. Pasta sauce at least tasted ok.
Cannoli was really bad. Consistency was off - very runny. Instead of Vanilla extract they used Almond and and way too cinnamon.
I'd have to come back again and give it one more try and order different dishes to give my final opinion.</Review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>Well not in love here.  I do like the calming Italian music and the cleanliness. After that it starts dropping quickly.  Wait staff at lunch have 0 enthusiasm.   The salad was very basic which is fine but the Cesar dressing was the worst I have ever had I think.  There was absolutely no flavor.  Next came 2 pieces of some kind of flat bread with a marinara sauce.  No flavor to sauce bread was very plain. No big deal I tell myself.  I am here for the nice hot pasta dish to come.  I mean I drove 15 minutes in the wrong direction to eat this thinking small, possibly family owned.  Hmm delicious Italian.  So my  baked pasta with Italian sausage shows up and boy does it look good.  But then wait,  what no flavor?  Damn my luck.  How ever it was hot and and and well it was hot. No need to come back.

I have been patronizing this establishment for the past year. I writing this review because of the disrespect I received from the owner! I called to explain that the to go order I received was not satisfactory because of the portion size that was about the size you would feed a child. The food is mediocre but it’s close in proximity to my residence. When I explained my self to the owner he told me that he knows who I am and that I always call to complain which is 100% not true!!!! I have only asked that there was an adequate amount of sauce ratio to pasta. In the past there was not enough sauce when I had previously ordered to go. He also said that he is tired of me calling to complain and that he’s sick of me calling and doesn’t care if I ever come back!! I guess he forgot about customer service and that you depend on us (customers) to keep your business going. If you want someone who doesn’t care about the customer and like just ok immatation Italian food then you should go to farfallas. I will never go back and now I understand why every time I’ve gone there the restaurant was always empty besides a few people. This business will fail and should take customer service classes because people do read reviews and base their decisions on others experiences. All I can say is WOW!!!! And not in a good way!< /text>

This is one of those small, intimate restaurants where you take your date to be romantic. The staff is very easy going, and extremely helpful. It's very much a family restaurant, the food is delicious, and prices are great. My favorite spot by far.</Review>

<review>Here visiting from Boston. I must say it was very good. I had chicken marsala it was delicious. My friend had creamy pesto chicken and mushrooms. We both cleared our plates. Good portions. Best of all was price 9.99 for mine thats unheard of in my area. Very impressed and full. Nice environment beer and wine.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<name>Jaime Frias Jr.<//name><Rate>5</Rate><Text>Phenomenal food, I went looking for a home style Italian cuisine restaurant to scratch an itch I had for Italian food (ever since having visited Milan and Venice recently and having true Italian food) that swayed away from usual franchise restaurants like Olive Garden, Bucca Di Beppi and such. Very VERY glad I did, the value for food is phenomenal and the food tastes absolutely DELICIOUS! This is true Italian cuisine and I will very much be returning to enjoy more of their dishes. Very highly recommend this place for Italian food.<//Text>< userid>

We had the pesto chicken pasta, chicken marsala, baked chicken alfredo, and bruschetta and I would highly recommend everything. Even the house salad was yummy with olives and peppercinis. Everything was very flavorful and there was plenty of food for all of us. Will definitely order from here again!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Very disappointed. Someone had recommended this place to me, but the lack of service is incredibly distasteful. The lack of staff made it difficult to ask for refills or any other necessities. I ordered a baked ziti, which was lackluster since it was just melted cheese on top of marinera penne. I have tried other baked ziti for less that is much better, although the the tiramisu was exceptional.</review>< name>

Anything you order is great service is outstanding prices are super reasonable u can't go wrong This is one of my favorite restaurant hand's down. Jose tellez.

I have to agree..with jose statement it is so authentic  and everything is made from scratch my server is the cutest Italian waitress you'll ever meet. She greets u and anything u order is hot n ready less than 20 minutes. There is many hot dishes to choose from. I give this place a 110% love u farfellas!!!! Vanessa  aranda< /Review>

<text>The foccacia bread was amazing and the bread that came with the spinach artichoke dip was great, but the dip itself tasted sour. Thw garlic bread tasted like cheese and not garlicy at all.. The fettuccine lacked seasoning and flavor, and the Greek pastas marinara was flavorless. The one good pasta was the chicken picatta it had good flavor and the chicken was delicious. Overall if I ever decided to go back it would only be for the foccacia bread and the chicken picatta maybe.<//text>< pictures>

<text>after a 1000 mile road trip we stayed 2 nights here was woken up by construction workers 5am 7 am both nights. 8/31 At 10:30pm me and my family came back to rest after visiting family we had no place to park so hotel personal told us to park far away from our room in a handicapped parking spot.  Next to our room was parked a big construction truck with 5 guys sitting outside drinking being loud.  Horrible management and all they say is sorry. We filed a complaint to refund all our money through 3rd party.  You guys made our mornings hell out here never again I will stay here. went outside and saw my truck scrapped.<//text>< pictures>

OLD MOTEL NEEDING RENOVATION

Staff is very attentive (During the day only) and they call you after you arrive to your room to ensure everything is fine. They even loaded the ice bucket and left it inside the fridge to save you that trip to the ice machine (Which is right next to the lobby).

Unfortunately this is an old motel setup and you can't stop feeling that you'll get robbed as you walk into your room. The fact that the lobby is locked after hours is not nice. We wanted to wait in the lobby for our Uber because it was super early and we had to use the phone outside the lobby to call the attendant , who was sleeping! So we had to wait for him about 5 minutes before he opened the door. At 3:00 AM that's not something you'd like in a hotel.

The toilet had issues flushing sometimes and the light on the sink worked occasionally. The TV is a 32 inch LED and they have the usual channels: HBO, TBS, Disney, etc. nothing special. We didn't have an opportunity to check the iron or the safe.

Very useful is that at walking distance, there is a plaza nearby full of Mexican-oriented businesses and a Papa John's pizza restaurant. You can get tacos and food in the Mexican super market or a haircut or a loan.

It is also under construction and everything is l day there is noise, dust and you can not rest.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT AT THE ABSOLUTE. (-10 stars)< /review>< userid>

<review>Not to bad of a place to stay,  construction going on next to them,  hard to park if you have a truck,  also if you smoke find somewhere else to stay. If they see you on camera smoking and will run you off to the back end of the parking lot.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs5VfoBJcgvHoul2dZBtjn0cIKkB7CJ5cAK6c_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB1rp9NNZMuAwyqH912NlQmI3blxt92UNBg2a1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO1Ynmfm95ARYVEZ4qlVtlqlOrqLE7yK9ksA6D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

I don't get the reviews for this place. It was such a cool mix of old school, outside door, road side California hotel and quality material, staff and cleanliness brought by being a Holiday Inn Express.

The staff was amazing. Always smiling and helpful. Breakfast was really good and plentiful!

The area is a little sketch for some maybe but I really enjoyed my stay here.</Text>

Stayed here on our cruise through California. It's a basic hotel that felt like a motel. The complimentary breakfast made me a little nauseous. Maybe it was the yogurt? The shower rod in our room wasn't securely attached. We did receive an upgraded room which was nice. The pool and hot tub were also nice and clean. The bathroom door can impede access to the sink which is a little inconvenient at times. We would recommend another Holiday Inn until the construction is finished and a little sprucing up around the property is completed.</text>

It's a quaint, older property on the South side of the city. It's a two-story motel (doors open to the parking lot) that is fairly well maintained. Parking is a little tricky and tight. There is construction (at the time of this review) in the neighboring lot.

Conveniently located near shopping and a variety of restaurants.

If you are commuting to the Sunnyvale/Santa Clara area, plan on leaving early and getting back late.</review>

< Review>
I called reservation line and was told they did accept emotional support dogs if i had the papers from my husband's doctor.  I drove to this location and upon check in i was told they didn't accept any animals except service dogs with papers from the state.  I explained that i had called and the reservation line said they did.  The manager then rudely said "it's against the law to say you have a service dog if it's not" i told him i had not claimed a service dog but specifically said emotional support. He backtracked and said "well im just saying."<//Review>

I was so impressed by the staff at this hotel! They were the nicest and most friendliest staff. The room and the entire property was immaculately clean. The hotel property itself is older and not as nice as some of the other Holiday Inn Expresses I have stayed but this was by far my favorite stay because of the staff. They also had more breakfast choices than I have ever seen at one of the the free buffet breakfast offered by this class of hotel. Just all around a great experience and would definitely stay there again.</text>

In fact there is a construction going on right in front of the property. New holiday Inn opens on fall '19. Amenities and cleanliness of the room is fine.

<Review>I was expecting a more typical holiday inn where there's a lobby that leads to all the rooms, but this holiday inn is set up more like an outdoor motel. Its loud right outside the room because of neighbors or cars. The rooms are a bit outdated but not awful. The staff are super friendly and the hot tub/pool is decent. If you can get a good price on this hotel, it's worth the stay.< /Review><Time>1547620313074</Time><resp>None</resp><Name>Regina Maj< /Name>< user>

We needed to book a place very quickly when a nearby hotel lost our reservation! We felt in the end that we ended up at the better hotel! We were traveling with two young boys and there was a perfect little pool for them along with breakfast int he morning and snacks in the afternoon. Wonderful, friendly staff.</Review>

<review>We stayed here for one night when we had tickets to Cirque du Soleil at the Santa Clara Fairgrounds and were stoked about the location, it couldn't have been any more convenient and saved us 20 bucks on parking since we were able to walk there in 10 min. The room was nice and spacious, we wanted to take advantage of our chance to sleep in so we didn't get up for breakfast but it is included from 6-9 am. The entire parking lot is under construction and it looks like they're putting in a "suites" side to the hotel, but we didn't hear any construction noise while we were there. I feel we got a good value on the perfect room for the night if you're going to an event or visiting the area.</review>< pictures>

My room is clean and the staff are nice. They have to be, because this HI express is an "L shaped" older style outside access motel. It currently surrounds a construction site where the new HI express will sit. I'm sure the new hotel will be lovely, and the staff will be much happier. I work on graveyard shift, and ATTEMPT to sleep through the day. They are currently excavating right in front of my room. 3 back hoes and 3 dump trucks run All DAY. I'm writing this review instead of sleeping, because I can't.<//Text>

The hotel was okay. Older facility that is building a new one on site. When I booked online the web page showed a brand new looking IHG hotel. This place was a 1960's designed hotel with rooms opening our to the parking lot. Rooms were all updated. Satellite TV had to reboot and couldn't watch for 10 minutes each time it happened.</text>

The hotel is a little way from the centre of town and I'd never stayed in a "doors open outside" American hotel before.

If I'd rated the hotel as I came through the door I might have jumped to a poor decision.

The fact is this is a friendly, well run hotel with all the amenities you could need a short cab ride from down town. It delivers exactly what it promises and does it well.

One thing that deserves special mention are the staff who are extremely courteous and helpful.

I knocked a star off because of three things:
- Shower head fixed to wall like a prison.
- Noisy refrigerator in my room
- No proper tea anywhere (just flavoured herbal stuff)<//Review>

The staff tries hard, but they don't have much to work with.  The hotel is old, dated, and the road/airplane noise is too much for the gaps around the doors which open to the outside.  They are building a new hotel on the site so hopefully that one will be the quality I expect from holiday inn.</review>

Stayed for 4 nights. This is not typical of a Holiday Inn, with room entrances directly from outside: motel-like style. Reminded me of a Motel 8.
Staff is not very accommodating. Continental breakfast with not much of a variety, no waffles and very diluted juices. Breakfast area is in a small area around guest services desk.
Room was clean and had all the amenities. Plenty of parking.
Would be a good hotel for a night stay.<//review>

Different setup of hotel as parking is right up the door. Room was neat. Gym is small but with enough equipment. Pool is small, not good for laps.  Several small convenience stores with walking distant and restaurants 5 mins in car.<//Review>

<text>Friendly service as always. We visited them roughly a year ago but had to cut our stay short due to an injury that occurred while in town--as an apology, they gave us popcorn and other treats. They remembered us from our last stay as well, and are always kind. Will go out of theit way to help. Rooms are clean and the hot tub is a blessing.</text>< Pics>

While the rooms are not terrible, this hotel sits directly under the landing strip for the airport in San Jose.  Also it is kind of hard to see from the photos, but this hotel has access to the rooms from outdoors. This makes it very loud when someone is walking by with their bags and while talking.  Also you don't really have that "safe and secure" feeling you get with the hotel being all indoors.  Also there is a very busy main road right next to the hotel as well.  So if you are a light sleeper, I would strongly recommend choosing one of the other Holiday Inn Express hotels in town.  I did like how the sink was not in the bathroom and the room was very spacious.  The bed was a little disappointing and not as comfortable as the other 6 Holiday Inn beds that we've stayed in so far on our trip this vacation.  And I'm sorry to say that there was about four short hair stands in the bed; I think the sheets were clean just not as good as it could have been.  And the carpet could have used a little bit better vacuuming job. I did like the lights that were in the ceiling over the bed and they had about it 160 different channels on the tv which was nice along with a nice tv.< /Text>

<text>I stayed at this hotel for four nights for a professional development that was nearby. The staff that works here are fantastic, patient, and respectful. I ended up having some issues during check in because of misunderstandings with booking. The staff helped me through the issues and made me feel at ease. While waiting they happily greeted returning visitors to this specific hotel and were very gracious. The food is typical Holiday Inn Express complimentary food. When you book with a rewards number by joining their rewards program you get two free bottles of water in your room. The hallways are outside. The gym is typical basic gym with treadmills, elliptical, bike, and all-in-one weight machine. They have a small sauna and pool too. They have two computers in the lobby where you check in and have breakfast. My room was standard holiday inn room with a queen sized bed clean room and comfy sheets. Of course not Ritz quality sheets but comfy!
BIG CON: If you're a light sleeper, you will struggle with this location. It is near the airport, so you can hear planes going by. You're also able to hear cars, neighbors...everything. I heard my neighbor watching tv. I was on the 2nd floor.
Overall good hotel but not good for light sleepers.< /text><date>1499837875452</date>< username>

<Review>Nice facility and rooms, but the street noise is horrible and right under the airplane landing path. New construction starting in January 2018 for a new hotel will only add to the noise. Over priced based on similar places.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The room was clean.
The soundproofing was not adequate.
The rooms face directly to the street like a 70s motel.
The price was expensive, considering the area.
The Hampton down the street is cheaper, cleaner, nicer building, good soundproofing, with interior doors to the rooms.<//Text>

Close enough to downtown. Kind of noisy at night (street noise) I hope the new building fixes the noisy rooms.<//text>

The room is clean. But it is too far away from any restaurant.
Also, the people upstair had a 6am party, I called the front desk, but they did not stop them quickly enough. (why on earth will someone throw a party in a hotel 6am!!!)</text>

My daughter went to get her hair dyed back to her natural light brown color. She is getting ready to go into the Army. She had blonde highlights in it. She came out with black colored hair, with hair dye all over her hair line. This is not what she wanted.  Not to mention at one point the Stylist started with putting bleach in her hair then realized that was wrong and used a towel to wipe it off.  Not a good experience at all. Very disappointed considering  all the great comments.<//Text>

I've been bringing my son here for the last 4 years off and on, but we came to realize that Molly is amazing and shes really sweet and gentle with our son, no matter how difficult it can get with him not wanting haircuts she remains patient and in the end still gets his hair cut perfectly. We've tried many other places but here is were we always come back! They have a clean salon and it's always packed so make an appointment if you don't like waiting. I've come to learn that they are very precise and do an amazing job for the low price. My husband has been coming here too and we make a special trip out here from North Sac just to get both of their haircuts. Definitely give them a try and any of the ladies will hook you up I'm sure but Molly is our gal!</Review>

My regular lady was not in. I get this lady who does not understand English well. I tell her just an inch off . She then proceeds to shave my whole whole hair off! Then she gets a phone call while on the phone she is shaving my head and shaving rough very rough even on my ears! Horrible cut job and horrible customer service ! Never going back to get my haircut there again! Then she gets mad because I only gave her a 2.00 tip when I usually give a 5.00 tip but not for the ugly job she did to my head!<//review>< Name>

Tina is the best, i and my siblings return to this place just because  of Tina, she does the best job in this place and treats her customers  with respect and understanding, even if you dont like something about haircut, she takes criticism well and improves 100% next time, cant say the same for other barbers.< /Text>

They don't have a sign in sheet so when my daughter had to go to the bathroom and I was standing there waiting and they asked me who's next I said I am but I'm waiting for my daughter to come out of the bathroom they skipped me not once but twice! And when I called them on it when they finally sat me 15 minutes later they said oh I'm sorry I didn't hear you even though two of them looked at me and then said, NEXT!</Review>

<review>What’s crazy is, I haven’t been in this store in at least three years and that experience traumatized me. I didn’t realize it until today, when I was going to order an Apple Watch online but saw that I could get it in the store sooner. Just the thought of going back in there, where the employees were rude and condescending, made me so upset that I started shaking. I remember contacting TMobile customer service and them saying that store complaints had to be submitted elsewhere and gave me an address. Then when multiple friends said they’d had similar experiences, it made me wonder how the same staff could have worked there more than a month without TMobile addressing the problem. Anyway, I didn’t write a review then but figured that since the experience had given me since a visceral reaction, I needed to share.<//review>< time>

<Text>Five stars just doesn't seem like enough!  Jesus and Martin were a dream team getting my family's and our business account transferred from another carrier.  It was somewhat confusing and frustrating on some things and they never once made me feel like they were being put out or like they weren't happy to help.  During the process I also dealt with Elaine and she is forever so friendly and helpful, even following up with me when I completely missed our appointment (totally my fault).  While all of the employees always have greeted me with a smile and have answered countless questions, these three were the ones that I had the pleasure of working with and they went above and beyond on every level.< /Text>< pics>

<review>I went to another t mobile store in riverside, I wasn't able to go through the process, just run. The credit and the kid fraudulently started an act in my name and there were charges on it. This store was fantastic, they called the fraud dept. Did everything possible and the manager Jackie even called to check up on how the progress was going. Very happy, let's hope the service is as good as employees<//review>< pictures>

This is the most horrible experience  I've ever had buying a phone I switched frome metro to t mobile ..tmobile may have better cell reception but metro has better customer service..the manager can't seem to put my screen protector right..this will be the 4th time I have to waste my time and gas to go into the store .when you pay 1300 for a phone and 40 bucks for a screen protector it should be done right..<//Text>

The staff was attentive when you want to buy something. If you are without a phone because of it being lost and theft, they are pretty rude and not helpful. They could let people use their computer for that situation too.<//review>

<Text>Well since I switch over from Att to T-Mobile Veteran’s plan I have been having issues  with billing. I walked into the store several time about being over charged on. First time I return it was because they charged me for 2 extra lines and T-Mobile plus which I didn’t not order. They told me that they were going the issue me a $40.00 credit which would’ve fix it but they didn’t

Then today I walked in the Greenspot store in Highland CA again. Bill still not fixed and also found out that my 11 year old has international calling, I wasn’t aware the she was going anywhere.  I showed the bill in hand with the charges . It showed that the mathematician didn’t add up to my plan. Which were $55, line 1, $25, line 2, and $10 every additional line, which include taxes  with auto pay addin up to $90 . So I spoke a gentleman named John, which the only reason I knew that  his is name John was because I walked back into the store after I left to ask for his card. John handed me a card with the store information but no name. I had to turn around and go back into the store to ask him his name.

The first young lady that looked at my account and understood what my concerns were and called John over. John became very stern as he walk over to explain the bill to me. I told him I understand the bill, he was telling me about taxes, which he didn’t bother looking at the bill to see that the taxes were included. John was very short to me. He being a young man and I being almost 60.

I said ok and said that I well go to another t mobile store to fix the problem. John  walked away very apathetic and started to work on a computer.

I departed and headed to the the T mobile store at Alabama and Laconia in Redlands CA, as I walked in I asked if this was a corporate store and was told yes by a young lady that immediately introduced herself as Elaine (Barajas) . l expanded what was happening and she checked my account,  did the math and saw that in fact it didn’t add up.

She then called corporate and between her, corporate, and the store manager figured all what was done wrong by the franchise store located  on Greenspot , in the City of Highland CA. and fixed it, I ported  in one more  phone numbers and added a line and left happy ever after.< /Text>< Time>

Horrible Customer Service by Justin, everytime i come in to get something fixed bcuz of an input error in there part customers fault all the time. He is there to make point not care of the needs of the cuatomer. I recommend the Corporate Store by Sams Club unless Christian or a Manager assist you avoid Justin and the headache your going have exchanging a phone that overheats Galaxy S6...< /text>

if you know what you want, they will provide it. Just do your research before you go  to the store, otherwise you may get something that is not the best option for your needs.< /Text>

<review>Dr. Skaar and her staff are the most professional and caring veterinarian clinic that I know.  I come from Santa Clarita.  The doctor does her research and stays current with all veterinarian issues.  Her rates are reasonable.  I would highly recommend her pet hospital.< /review>< pictures>

Every time we take our dog here, we have a great experience. They always  help get us in even when our schedule is difficult. They treat our dog Butterball like gold and the staff is always nice to us. The doctor, often times, calls us personally to explain things which I always really appreciate. On top of all of this, their fees are fair. We will always come here! Thanks for taking care of our baby!</Review>

They take great and thorough care of our senior kitties. We very much appreciate the direct and frank information.< /review>< pics>

Worst service, worst care, malpractice, uneducated staff. Wellness plan is a joke, you’re paying for untrained staff to medicate your animal. STAY AWAY. For your wallet’s sake, and your pet’s health.<//Review>

This vet office may be short on curb appeal, but not on the care of ones pet. Thank you Dr Skaar (and staff) for taking care of my cat, Too Short, especially during this pandemic!! Visiting the vet right now is a different experience. You pull up in your car and call, they come get your animal, you wait and then the doctor calls you. Kind of takes some of the anxiety away, not being inside with your pet. Anyhow, very professional and friendly experience all around.</Text>

Awesome first experience. I had no expectations here and I was completely impressed. This is a small clean place with an excellent all around staff. I watched each patient ahead of me receive a thorough check in by a caring office manager who actually walked around to where each person was sitting and obtain a full history of their pet and the reason for their visit. I initially went to TL Animal Hospital because of a doctor (Dr Nunez) I had previously seen and loved, who was from another hospital. He had moved. I'm so glad to have found him again and even better that he landed in such a great little place. The Dr, Vet Tech and reception staff all get 5 stars from me. Thank you for the great experience!<//text>

They have cared for my series of animals since they opened. They are THE BEST: loving & reasonable. Dr Bamford takes time to answer questions or will research if she is not familiar with whatever I have come up with.< /review>

Recommended by a friend, I took my dog who had a hematoma on her ear, that had been drained a week before by my regular Vet. Dr. Carole drained it again and provided another type of treatment. A week later, she is doing 100% better. My regular Vet said the Only option was a $900 surgery.< /text>

<text>We moved to LA 2 yrs ago and I found this gem. This office is a fair and reputable business. They don’t have a fancy office, they don’t overcharge, they don’t push you to do extra stuff you don’t need. Our dog recently went through a tough time. Dr Skaar called on a Sunday when she was paged.. the fact that you have this option is a bonus. She called and followed up daily   After 2 wks we had to put our girl to sleep.  She came in on her day off to do this. I’m thankful for this office and I recommend them to anyone who asks.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I'm not going to my old vet anymore unless its an emergency because he's available more than she is.  I recommend her!!!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c29577e8dc5713:0x7f71f568a38beb68</gmapID></record>

Outstanding service. I've been here 5 or 6 times and every time it has been the same day I made the appointment. Prices are very reasonable and the staff is very friendly. I don't typically review things unless I'm exceedingly happy or disappointed in something. I HIGHLY recommend this vet.< /Review>

Dr Skaar and her staff are amazing. They and kind and considerate and just cool as hell overall. They get busy because they're awesome. Really though, they listen and really dig down to find the issues and the right treatment.</Review>

<review>I love Dr. Carol and her fabulous staff. She is extremely knowledgeable and very caring for all of her patients. In all the years I have taken my dogs to Dr. Carol, she never recommended unnecessary testing. Her prices are very reasonable, and she always does what is the best thing for your fur baby. I highly recommend Dr. Carol Skaar.</review>< Pics>

The doctor is thorough and caring and the prices are reasonable. I had my kitten fixed  and they called to check up on him the next day. I have since brought my other pets to the practice and am delighted with my find.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place was a great find! Dr. Skaar was fantastic, friendly, and informative. I felt like she was concerned for the immediate needs of my cat and not trying to push any other procedures or agendas (unlike previous veterinarians). And then their pricing for a check-up & antibiotics was CONSIDERABLY less expensive($60) than other vets I've been to see(usually $150). I am very happy with the Toluca Burbank Dog & Cat Hospital and will be returning!</text>

Dr. Skaar and her staff are amazing.  They are always attentive, listen and honest about what is happening with my pets.  Animals are the priority not the bottomline/profit.  Wish I had found her much earlier in my pethood process.</Text>

About two years ago, I changed from my vet to Toluca Burbank Dog & Cat Hospital based on recommendation.  The staff and Dr. Carol Marienthal-Skaar are very professional, show their passion on our beloved animals PLUS their cost are reasonable.</Text>

I had a great experience here! They were gentle but thorough and left my nails looking great! Regarding their COVID protocol, they always wore masks and had us sanitize and get our temperature checked as soon as we walked in. They also have plastic boards between the person doing your nails and yourself, which they sanitize with blue light after every client. Overall I would definitely recommend this spot for a great experience that felt safe!<//text>

I tried calling multiple times in a row and I just got a dial tone so I decided to show up anyway. The pedicure was OK nothing special I’ve had better but the part that was a little distracting to me was the woman that was running the place was constantly on her phone while she was working with clients and it was so distracting and loud and it was difficult to relax. I would maybe go there again in an absolute emergency.<//Review>

I've been to this place twice now.  I should have just put my hands and feet in a lawn mower.  They rush and do a horrible job.  Maybe for women, they're better.  Not for me.  Look at the picture and zoom in at my finger nails.  They were done a few hours ago.<//text>

Fastest Brazilian wax in the west...! Ha 😳 but really, they are kind and courteous and clean, and can squeeze me in always. Could use a bit more delicacy and maybe special treatments like the pain reducing cream or oil before/after, but it’s a fair price in SF and i trust them. Have been 1x for nails and great gel set.<//text>

<review>This place is great if you want SNS, they were the only ones on the block so I went to them. They charged me $55 for mediocre service of a single solid colour on my real nails. Although they didn't do an awful job (bumpy, slightly uneven, didn't keep length and shape that I asked for) it was overpriced. Should not have costed more than $20. My usual place does state of the art nails for that price, but SUN though a good experience, was not worth the money. I still applaud the effort.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808f7e1e0aba8fa3:0xb04d6c6e1ae9c102<//Gmap_id><date>1577145007613< /date><pics>None</pics>< userid>

Amazing staff and service. Simply Unique Nails is a must try! You won't need to look for another nail salon after you receive the custom service and attention that you deserve. I loved that the manicures and pedicures are done separately so that I could enjoy an all around relaxing experience.< /Text>

<Review>Came to Sarah for the first time today with my friend and had such a great experience. She's super welcoming and really funny. She knows what she's doing for sure, and is extremely precise!  I had no problem communicating the design I wanted and I am so happy with the results.

Fantastic nail salon, convenient to multiple street car lines and subway or BART. Anyone who remembers Nob Hill Nails (Hyde & California) will love this place because you may see some familiar faces!  Simply Unique Nails has talented manicurists that do top notch work. Appointments are recommended although they will accept walk-ins when they can.<//text>

They did a great job on my feet but when it came to my nails (I got an acrylic refill)  the woman cut my finger several times and it really hurt. Also the paint job for my nails were not worth the money. For both my feet and nails it was $60 instead of 50. I just paid and promised to not come back. If you want your feet done they do a GREAT job but don’t get your nails done there.< /Text>

< Review>
Today will be my last visit.  I've visited many times but I don't know what made me really pay attention to my service this time. Hygienically speaking, I was unnerved by a few things... the technician dipped the brush she used to apply a clay mask to my legs in my foot basin (yes my feet had already soaked in the basin) then proceeded to dip that same brush into the clay mixture and painted my legs with it.  Ummm, that would be cross contamination.  How many others had that been done to?  The other cross contamination issues were the fact they actually touch your toes with the tips of the bottles of cuticle lotion, and the oil dropper.  It also appeared the technician reused her gloves, or at least did not change them when she had to leave another client and return to me to complete my service.  I'm bummed because I liked going there.   Plenty of chairs, I rarely had a wait even if I just walked in.  The staff is pleasant and do a great job on your feet... minus  these issues.< /Review>

really bad services, I went on Saturday, my nail polish is already off...I asked for Mani+Pedi, the massage was short (probably 30 seconde) and poorless, for the Mani nothing was done and the nail polish is not even covering the entire part of my nails. I will definitely not recommended this place, for the price and the result my little sister of 5 can do better.</Text>

My wife went in there today to get her pedicure done and it was her first time there. She had a horrible experience, will not recommend at all! They were in a hurry the whole time, the girl who did her to nails didn’t even clean under her nails (her name was mong). They refused to meet her needs when she asked nicely and respectfully, and left her toenails uneven, crooked, and they did not even paint them correctly. Horrible place!</Text>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>Good, but not great.
Nail salons are tough to rate, because it's the nail tech that is responsible for your experience primarily, not necessarily the salon. Lots of staff, some are really sweet and personable, some are all business. The prices are fair, $40 for a pedicure and french mani, pretty standard for a major city.

This place is great for a group if you book ahead of time. I've been here twice for two surprise birthday celebrations, including my own, and those two times it's definitely felt like we were taken care of and pampered just a little bit more. The quality of the service is okay, nothing phenomenal or outstanding, but good enough if you need to get a decent job done.< /Review><date>1373073658546</date><gmapID>0x808f7e1e0aba8fa3:0xb04d6c6e1ae9c102<//gmapID>< Name>

Super nice people, but they painted about half my toenail, left some of my old nail polish on and had two different girls working on me because they took on too many customers.  Also, they charge the same for a pedicure with no polish...</Review>

Random find because we were having brunch across the street at Chow. They got us in within 15 minutes and even though they were super busy, did a great job and were super friendly. In and out within 40 minutes for gel manis. Highly recommended!!<//text>

Completely overcharged for a full set and pedicure. ($90!) Kept trying to push a gel manicure and upselling me on services even after I declined. Had to ask the technician working on my acrylics to stop talking to the other girl and actually pay attention to me (she was doing them without looking). Polish was sloppy around edges and has started to crack not even 24 hours later.<//text>

<date>1390839746579< /date><Text>S.U.N. is on par with most other nail spas in the city, which is to say that it's disappointingly average. It's located at 14th & Church, right behind Churchill. You can make appointments but you should expect to wait if they're busy. The polish selection is decent (almost exclusively OPI). The buffing leaves MUCH to be desired (I had to ask to have the outsides of my big toes buffed, and even then, it was one quick swipe and done). The quality of the work varies, so don't be afraid to speak up if they missed a spot or you ended up with polish on your skin. They'll cheerfully fix it. On the upside, it's clean, they serve free water and soft drinks, and prices are reasonable ($25 + tip for a basic pedicure).

Tip: Rainbow Nails on 24th St in Noe is similar in price and execution, but they include a paraffin wax treatment that keeps callouses off for much longer.<//Text><userid>114163658858039149063< /userid><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Marie T Fisher< /name><rate>3<//rate><Gmap_id>0x808f7e1e0aba8fa3:0xb04d6c6e1ae9c102</Gmap_id>< Resp>

This is my go-to salon in the entire city of San Francisco.  The prices can't be beat and the quality of polish is good.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  They even wrapped my roommate's toes with saran wrap after her pedi was done so the nails wouldn't be ruined in her closed-toed shoes.

I've gotten a French mani-pedi for a wedding, it lasted long after the event was over.<//Review>

<review>The dishes were huge, we ordered sesame chicken, fried wonton and fried shrimp. But we ended up taking the sesame chicken home. It's a lot of food. The taste was good. It's really worth for the money.<//review><date>1556478740108< /date><rating>4<//rating>< username>

I ordered the cashew chicken lunch special. Came with white rice and chow mein. It was $9 after tax. The food was good. It's a very low key place.<//text>

The spring rolls were amazing.
We ordered shrimp double pan friend rice and the pepper steak.
We were not disappointed.
The food was hot and tasty.
The place is real cute and the staff is friendly.</Review>

I've been a loyal customer of Top Wok for the past three years when I first discovered it. Top Wok has the best chinese food in Redondo! If you're in the mood for comfort food, they are definitely the place to go! Their noodles are always bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. My favorite side dish is the eggplants they make! And I love their curry chicken! I have always been highly impressed with the customer service. They also have a really delicious coffee shop! I highly recommend Top Wok to everyone!<//Text>

<review>Top Wok disappointed me. I was craving the Chinese take-out comfort food I remember from my youth--not fancy fusion cuisine, not challenging authentic cuisine, and not fast food--and after reading these reviews, I was hopeful that Top Wok would hit the spot. I ordered hot braised shrimp and pork with broccoli. The pork was not great, but the shrimp was the real disaster. There were two shrimp in my hot braised shrimp. Two. The dish was 80% under-cooked carrots. If they were out of shrimp, they could have told me and I would have ordered something else.

The restaurant was clean and empty, the prices were low, and the staff was friendly enough. If I lived across the street from this place I would try it again and hopefully find something on the menu that I like.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>Place was pretty slow when I came in, I ordered from the “express” lunch menu. About 20 minutes later they let me know they forgot to place my order. Food was mediocre and bland when it showed up, half an hour after I ordered it in the empty restaurant. I didn’t even bother finishing it. Don’t waste your money.< /review><UserId.>118445573029081813506<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<user_name>Berry Vandit< /user_name><review>Reviewing their deliver services: Speed: I got the food in like 20 minutes, while it is still hot and fresh. The size of the potion was fair plus. And everything tasted good. I am happy I found this location, and I am planning to order from them again. I had the Singapore Mai Fun that was ok, or even better than OK when it was delivered. Maybe I even try the restaurant itself one day.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b490abc91b67:0x9a8a74ffacec132e<//Gmap_id>< Date>

Everything I've ordered has been great and way better quality than Panda Express. This is the only place where you can order jalapeño fried rice…yum!  Love the fact that they deliver….Don't make the mistake of ordering through GrubHub, though. Order directly from the restaurant!< /text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Los Angeles and the surrounding cities are peppered with stellar restaurants that are hidden except to the locals that found them.  In a little strip mall in Redondo Beach lives one of those hidden gems:  Top Wok!

This is the Chinese food you are always hoping to be served.  It sets the bar high for anything else you will find in Socal, whether super high end or hole in the wall.  We live an hour away and drive to Redondo Beach just to eat here.

Potstickers that are delicate and delicious.  Beef sticks that I could eat as a meal by themselves.  The sole in hot garlic sauce and shrimp in black bean sauce and both savory and chock full of tender bits of fish/shrimp and fresh veggies.  My personal favorite is the Kung Pao (we got the chicken) - honestly every time we go out for Chinese, this is the Kung Pao we are always comparing to!!

No steam table.  Cooked to order.  SO worth the drive.  Seriously, there should be a line down the street.  So damn good!!<//review>< user_name>

Excellent food excellent prices-Im pretty picky about where I eat especially when it comes to Oriental food. This place is amazing I cannot figure out how they can serve big portions of home cooked food at these very good prices. The beef is sourced from Australia, the noodles and vegetables are fresh, it is the opposite of typical oriental fare whose commercial pre-fab ingredients make everything taste the same; or worse, taste flat like a Pik up Stix or other unimaginative chain. I have had the Chicken curry, sweet and sour, and my favorite the Kung Pao chicken. None disappoint; fresh, home cooked and cheap. I eat there whenever Im in the area, good thing i dont live in Redondo or Id be there everyday, fat as a sumo wrestler.</Review>

Ordered a beef chow mein and it looked like they scraped left overs from the previous customers plates. Huge portion of yuck!
The 'beef' was chewy and had a strange greyish opaque color. It did not taste like beef at all. In fact, judging from the size and shape of each piece, it was probably rat meat or something. The noodles were bland and the vegetables tasted like they came out of a can.
This place really sucks.<//Text>

The restaurant is nice, and the service is good, but it's overpriced. The food is pretty bland, and they don't allow you to substitute noodles for rice with a combo meal. Just go to Panda Express, your taste buds and wallet will thank you.< /review>

However, this gas station tends to be quite busy, for I prefer to use the credit/debit card option at the pump to pay as they also provide the receipt option. This last week, I used the same pump for 3-4 consecutive days and no receipt paper was loaded, so I had to walk in the store for a copy which I find completely inconvenient, as I pay outside to be in and out. Moreover, I speak with several employees about this issues and receive attitude as if this were my fault. Lastly, the employee I spoke with last, said he would tell the manager so this is fixed. Therefore, today when I pumped gas I figured it must be fixed and sadly, the same problem occurred no receipt paper along with poor customer service.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>Even those this is like less than a mile from my home I never go here.  The gas stops pumping gas normally, and the cashier doesn't care. Pumps take extra gas when they have to be restarted.  Not to mention it's always extremely crowded and the gas is like water , it doesn't last long.  I advise going to food for less , about the same price and the gas lasts longer. Sure north long beach can be a little ghetto, but at least the gas pumps work.</Review></record>

I frequently go to this gas station, because they give GREAT service, and ALWAYS with a smile. I'm in a wheelchair due to a motorcycle accident, and I used to have problems going to other gas stations, trying to get my gas pumped or trying to find a friend or family member to go with me. I told a friend of mine, that's in a wheelchair, and he suggested here, saying that the employees are so hospitable, and he was certainly right. They always come out to my truck with a smile, regardless of what employee it is, and I've offed a tip, on more than one occasion, to different ones and they've never excepted it, not once. I'm not sure if it was the owner or a manager that told me, to keep my money, they are glad to help with the gas always. I'm not sure who to talk to but they need to be recognized, and rewarded, for their kindness towards the handicap. THANKS SO SO MUCH!

As everyone has mentioned before Steve is efficient, skilled, and quick! We had great conversation while he swiftly fixed my phone and he threw in a free screen protector!

<text>If you value your time than this is the place to go. I had issues with my laptop charging (wouldn't charge) and the big box stores did nothing but tell me the issue was the battery and I would have to send it in which as we know, working from home makes my life a bigger mess. I went here and they said, "Give me 2 hours to run diagnostics and we can give you options". turns out it was just a power cord issue. The big box store didnt even have my cable in stock cause it was "a weird power cord". I had my laptop within 3 hours (including drive time to go home and back). They are even able to help transfer data for a small fee and show you how it all works. I think you pay a bit more than you would at the big box stores BUT they wont ship it off for 2 weeks and you aren't talking to some one who is just looking to pump their numbers or doesn't care.

Awesome customer service too.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1611785245298, 'text': 'Computer repair is one of our specialties.  thanks for the review Daniel'}<//response><gmapID>0x80dcdf78b1c0d60d:0xa66a30b49198530b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Immediately after getting my phone screen fixed here i received a notification saying my display was not recognized with apple and soon after my phone screen became discolored. I would not recommend coming here it is over priced and the quality is extremely cheep. After getting my phone repaired at another repair places they said that the previous repair place had used the cheapest materials. The environment is also completely unprofessional.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

When you called inquiring about our warranty you stated that you had cracked the corner of the screen. This damage voids your warranty unfortunately.  as a curtesy I offered to do the repair and charge you only for the part no labor. SO i was gonna charge you $90 instead of $150.  as for the other repair shop any repair shop will badmouth their competitors. Again sorry for your experience.'}<//resp>

<text>Al of the good reviews must have been paid for because I have not recieved such horrible service from anyone ever. I call the guy in advance, his questions are UNSPECIFIC over the phone. He says to call when I'm ready to bring in the phone, gives me a time frame that works for me. Already frustrated with services but in desperate need, I go to the location where he says he is currently occupied, AND WILL LET ME KNOW WHEN HE WILL BE ON HIS WAY. An HOUR GOES BY and there is no response as I'm just SITTING THERE IN THE PARKING LOT JUST WAITING FOR HIM to in the end tell me HE IS NO LONGER GOING TO SHOW. SO unproffessional. Unsafe place to just sit and wait, tweakers and homeless people everywhere, people sleeping in their car, needles and bandages everywhere. If you value the basics of HUMAN DECENCY and you NEED to get your phone fixed, please don't go here, and don't trust a WORD that comes out of this guys mouth. I understand life happens, but HE KNEW HE WASN'T GOING TO MAKE IT ALL WEEK (!!! ALL WEEK HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE OCCUPIED AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT!!!),  and LET ME WAIT THERE THINKING HE WAS GOING TO SHOW. I'm disgusted.<//text>< date>

Cracked my phone nailed it today. My phone was fixed in 15 minutes for $80. I was at at&t just before ready to spend $700 on a new one. The owner is very cool also. One of the pioneers in the business. Would go no where else.<//Review>

<text>Got my iPhone 7+ repaired here based on a recommendation of a friend.
The sound out of the earpiece stopped working the day after the repair. Two days after the repair, the cheap glass that wasnt the proper size (in my opinion) kept raising out of the phone until a couple hairline fractures started in the phone. The colors on my phone were not the true colors I had once had with my original screen. The cracks continued to spread until the display went completely black emitting a few colored lines on the screen. I work out of town so over a 10 day period I text and called the number to get my phone repaired again since he OBVIOUSLY did not do the job correctly the first time with absolutely no response whatsoever. So now I am using an iPhone SE because this man will not return a call or a text and every time I have went in to the location, but the door is either locked or he is not there. The man is very nice, but this has been the worst buying experience of my life.< /text>< gmapID>

<review>I brought my galaxy s8 here to have the screen replaced. The owner was very communicative about whole process. He ran into some issues that took the repair longer but the total cost never went up because of that. I didnt mind because he did an amazing job and threw in a screen protector for the inconvenience. Other places wanted to charge me 300 dollars for the same job but I'm glad I brought it here. I'll definitely come back here if I need to.<//review>< pictures>

I went to this location on multiple occasions with my sons iPhone for repair. They have always done a great job on his phones.
I'm a Galaxy guy myself (much better phone by the way)... I cracked my screen on my S8 and needed it replaced. They did so beautifully. I have some issues with my mic which he immediately took care of under warranty. I highly recommend them for all phone repairs.

Thanks guys!< /text>

Extremely rude, inpatient and not helpful. I went to get my phone screen fixed and was told a specific price, $50. When I got there, he said it would be $60. I asked him to explain why, and he got really irritated and rude with me. “Now... let me finish” if you want great service in phone repair, I highly recommend iSolutions down the street. He was able to easily explain the price difference I was receiving at this location and was extremely helpful, polite and knows what he’s doing. He can also fix the back of iPhone X phones at a really good price!</review>

I tried to explain 3 times and all 3 times you cut me off to the point that your daughter snapped at you and said "Dad stop, let him finish" and then i finally was able to fully explain why the price difference and i apologized for the miss understanding and also stated if you had told me over the phone that the touch was bad i would have given you a price of $60.  All of my prices are on my wall at the store so no one thinks I make up prices on the spot. again sorry for inconvenience and im glad you were able to get the phone fixed happy holidays.'}</Response>

Been there twice a bit after 6pm and place has been closed . You open so late you should close late too. Clearly other businesses want the business since they open earlier than 10am and close at a reasonable time ..
You should post on your business hrs

Very impressed with the service at Cracked My Phone. The owner, Tadeh is very knowledgeable and professional. The work was done quickly  and without any hassle. Also had them replace iPhone battery on same phone. Price was very reasonable, and less than the other places I called quoted me. Very pleased with the work. Although I hope I don't have occasion to, I would definitely use them again. Thanks, Tadeh!<//Review>

<Time>1579633906103</Time><rate>1</rate><text>I dropped my iphone and it wasn’t working so I took it to this place and the first thing I did not like was that the place was closed. I had to wait 10 minutes for the guy to come back. When the  guy came back he looked like he was in a bad mood because he didn’t let me explain what had happened to the phone. He was also impatient and kinda rude. He literally said to me “I’m busy, I’m working on other phones right now” “I can check your phone, leave it here and come back in an hour”  I came back after one hour and all he did was change the screen but didn’t actually fix it. Then he checked it again and I told him that the phone shows the apple image on the screen but then it goes dead and then he literally said “oh, that would have been nice to know” what the heck dude! First, You did not let me explain anything to you and second, you had the iPhone for one hour and in all that time you could not figure out what the problem was? The guy did not offer any other solution he just put the old screen back on my iPhone and when he gave it back to me he said “thank you, have a nice day” and shut the window in my face. I ended up just wasting time with this guy. In conclusion, I strongly advise people to go to another place. This guy is rude and doesn’t even have a good location, it’s just a kiosk in the middle of a parking lot. And to the guy who operates this place, If you are so overwhelmed with phones to fix then maybe you should hire an employee to help you. That way you won’t be so stressed out.

Edit: after reading some of the reviews it seems like the only thing this guy is good for is changing screens lol!<//text>< Pics>

I tested the battery and put on a new screen.  when i did that it turned on to the apple logo so i turned it off to get the ok from you before i did the repair.  you gave me the ok i did the repair and then it was stuck on the apple logo that is when you brought up the fact that it froze on the apple logo before.  yes i said you should have mentioned that when dropping off.  i closed the window because it is cold in my kiosk in the parking lot. i gave the phone back and said its not worth spending money on an iphone 5 your better off getting a new one.. thanks hopefully you resolve your phone issue..'}<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>Extremely knowledgable. After purchasing a faulty phone I was advised on how to remedy my situation. My problem was solved quickly with minimal cost thanks to CrackedMyPhone.

While I hope I don't have need for their services anytime soon, it would be a pleasure to work with them again.</Text>< Pictures>

It's probably a fine place, but I'll never know because when I showed up during their supposed business hours, I was met with a locked door. If your website, yelp page, and DOOR say you're open at 10am, then your door should be unlocked by 10am, let alone 10:10am....

The fact that this establishment can't even keep up with a relatively late opening time is disgraceful.

Why should I do business with a place that can't respect our times?< /text>

I shattered my iphone 7 screen and needed it fix quickly that same day. I texted him and as soon as I got there he took my phone, fixed it in 15 mins while I waited and even put a tempered glass on it. $70 which is a great price compared  to other places. Definitely will recommend to all my friends :)</review>

<Text>Never trusted anyone other than apple to repair any of my apple products. Cracked face on my iphone.  Heard about this place on a community chat. I've very impressed.  Honest! Set prices!  He does what he says! and tells you what to expect. Not just talking about phones.  I took my brand new Macbook air which I ruined 4 months ago by accidentally spilling a glass of water on it and it killed my computer....as I thought.  Apple quoted me $750 to fix this $2300 purchase of mine.  He just called me today and it's working and he cleaned it up for me and replaced a new battery for $200.  Thank you Taddeh! for taking care of my computer and the cracked glass on my phone.. I hope my computer will last me longer than for the time it took me to ruin it.   Gigi< /Text>< time>

<Text>I take both my kids here for cleanings and routine checkups. My kids are 3 and 5, it’s safe to say they aren’t scared to see their dentist. They get excited to see their dentist, which says a lot about the staff here. Staff takes the time to educate and answer any questions. One of the managers named Roberto is very patient with the kids here, great worker!< /Text><rating>5</rating><gmap_id>0x8085770226982575:0x2ad6b938a162791< /gmap_id>< user_name>

The staff there is very friendly and helpful ! They show so much patience with little ones. My kids absolutely HATE going to dentists but the staff there make things go a little easier and smoother for us all making it a much better experience than anticipated. Overall very thankful for the staff there and glad I found this office for my toddlers.< /review>

Brought my son to smart start dental for the very first time and my son loved it !

Plenty of picnic tables to enjoy your lunch. Make sure to pack some food to enjoy when you get to this location.<//review>< username>

It snowed while we were there. I would recommend crampons for inexperienced hikers during snowy months. I was fine hiking in Aria boots. There were ducks and geese in a smaller pool of water that walked straight over probably thinking we’d feed them. I will note that the public restrooms were closed and the portable restrooms were completely full.</Review></record>

<text>Pretty cool spot! I went here during the summer and saw the grass growing in the roof. That was pretty neat. The architecture and design on the building was aesthetically pleasing and pair that with lake out front... amazing.

Be ready to hike down! It’s isn’t bad but it will get your heart pumping and calves going.

There’s a bathroom near if anyone is wonder.</text>< Pictures>

Very beautiful location and the Castle is well kept. Currently due to the Pandemic situation the tours are on hold. But when we visited in 2018 the tours were on. The beach in front also provides you a relaxing environment.<//Text>

Beautiful waterfall if you keep going. Bring lunch to eat in front of lake. Pets not allowed but many ppl brought them along. Would not recommend if its to icy. Easy hike otherwise.< /review>

This is a State Park in Emerald Bay, Lake Tahoe,  with fee (NOT FREE) parking at the top with a winding  1 mile walk down to an amazing fortress like home built in the early 1900s.  At the time we came it was after season so the 28 room mansion was closed to visitors.</Text>

It was close when we went there so we weren't able to go inside to check it out. It looked like a medieval time castle and it's looks pretty old. I believe it's still under renovation and I think it'll be pretty awesome once it finished and opens up.</text>

Grass roof, powerful carvings, heavy wood doors with iron hardware, and stained glass windows inspire the pride in my heritage. Europeans brought great beauty to this realm. The lake is clean n clear, the island is pretty too, and it’s an area away from the more boisterous gatherings of people in Tahoe because of the walk it takes to get there and back. The 1.5 mile walk back to the road or parking lot is steep so bring water and it can be good to take your time; enjoy the woods, birds, or little creatures you might see along the way.<//Review>< pictures>

Beautiful architure, but you better be in decent shape to tackle the hike back up to the parking area.  There are picnic tables at the bottom as well as restrooms.  No tours were available on the day we went. The hike down was scenic and enjoyable !< /Review>

This was such a beautiful site! As a traveler from down south in Alabama, I don't get to see something like this every day. The surrounding scenery was breathtaking and the sights leading up to this were amazing! No argument from me, I believe there must be a God seeing all this incredible scenery. Wow!! Hope I can get inside next time down!</review>

Easy enough to reach the beach of Emerald Bay and back in under an hour. If you plan to picnic or swim at the beach, pay the full day parking. And yes, parking is limited and full after about 9:30 AM when we stopped today.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Beautiful home and beautiful spot. It's a steep hike on a very easy to walk on path. Small legs will probably need assistance. But it was worth the trek to see the beautiful sites and this beautiful home. There are picnic tables to have lunch and kayak rentals. The falls is breathtaking and would be a great day trip!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvLk5ckOWeP5o2doFmUnnn5sCMH75pNrRCuEUy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlP9gpq8D-r_5uuaeqE_jzMEwoJU-UCPsJRZ6k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvrIRQw-yzwlDJJMuCTvryLLADfW8O6bETKjmi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCY6POQCyhzh5CtxdhWif5PBVkKz8a1Bbku-my=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrvIkAWnSuYaWU3MQgTSpNktd-CNe48_MS_Osi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNc6fEzZ2bUcyBlonyRNczutw4rX2WyVYELQnmq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqFTL_JfhTRwqb8nvI-1f6kh-OU6kOA5cQk_Vr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-Hob9wn31ctf-8xuPANPoHPo3QrC7kekBAwAc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBGImQP5cWE-urcB4pHmPYeCKqvBIZM86dZxwb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6h2Ha6MzzJXQV5xVFp2Hlft-_DbOOhzsHrScM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnYadRBdbN96CJIYtXhI8Vo1sbaPhHvqH7lqYr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrN-KvN7h0dx0QjQCj4BsRA36QB9iLwkuYo1II=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_5PoEhwWc1Tlv6OrjYfuHK9MVAO7BSrNJ8Mmg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7ZctttbD3UJZc89tvtCQwXkO-6hqtznOHNufq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3_HzdXSYUmKsKLQ-eghbYEOwE6KdS710WKg7P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN4uveKM13cpXAMYCkXjrSEdkTWgYt04ovLIBO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwsHhqigmV71v8UHiMngYPtl_DAYSe6OvM7Xm2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7yrCPMJuXeDjtZKV263W9fwCU1BmsNKXmcpf-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPidRrNGb-mDVuxlaEy9KKD6tld6JkV9xpKqhUu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMducJqv6ikgwz7n13452bTS61hATIbC3wOFiTv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeDNgsAXjImI6_44S8EYPwQSxX1nDqOsyl4Klw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRSYaTJieUOM_CnrAlh6djw3WYfN304olO2m5-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoni40wTIz9zWrkRUIsziscuaDKwK3g_KONzcF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Very cool piece of Tahoe history. Park at the top and prepare for a somewhat moderate hike for inexperienced hikers - bring comfortable walking shoes. Or you can sail here, there’s a public dock available. Beautiful views and lots to learn here.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-AMyyrbHnGEDxGN47-lT4x_ojZP1JjBra-m4y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt4y5FIlFz626_uw520KYnlyyPN2dtAqY1m8wV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsev82wDBBN8IRapxVYFKRVr4t7DIvQ8zQbMB0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgmhCs_TqFLYpOV3U-HiBXQgqoO_4ileu8EirU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOq7dYJhJQ404Xr4hhbHhb7fCmpwJuKk_0tB24W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP63zshw0L7UX5XylXIaGtB8x5mHR_eRn7D3rxO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWYHExxySDCpBiefRzgxrNZNo3BHkpklgibsiU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpSHGqCN5vj3rcFuDfcvwl0gO0Y1bFEHYrnouo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCYq5PmkusGNTBtWyjpDqxd3JrtyIf1gIsCZ_o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtjhkIEOiEQ0b-QwXUeMXXXOhVEoGc7zOOw1Rq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3MUnI1mmhYOAJ304YeXu_CQ8DJtWC1oO3OnC_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN9YyyPdfsCulcf_S6iU0gYcpSSEscNhKtSuYB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOECzUqCRuiTSo2-uo0fA5IsdYAfpFSW0qVc9TW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPwfWB0MoqqwemMKLc6kOrgsNmPnthpSLBVj6l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOah97qgxNHWWx8ocRDJRd2-MNhsCO1HmG2Zci9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0hmwySGFw0Affe2dl2YQu-691go3XeZaAfOls=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFH-mSuX2x1Fh9-wJagfw_NpYboodhX7ShkL4w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

A rare masterpiece Scandinavian style constructed Vikingsholm in the Emerald Bay was worth the trip.  Beautiful scenic trail from the view above the stone observation to the unique Vikingsholm castle 500 feet below.  Just spectacular!<//review>

This was a tough hike for me, but it was very much worth it.  This place was really cool. And by the time I made it back to the top I felt like I had accomplished something.  Very much enjoyed my time here.<//Text>

<review>Fascinating tour of a beautiful 1920s mansion built at the short of picturesque Emerald Bay in Lake Tahoe. Full of Scandinavian workmanship, building methods, design features, and art motifs, it is really a fascinating architectural marvel. The tour is informative. A one-mile hike is required to reach the home on foot--no car access. It is downhill down and all uphill back to the parking lot. Boat access is conceivable. Well worth a visit.< /review></record></dataset><record>

This place is awesome. The history and the architecture are amazing. Be prepared for the mile long walk down and out to visit as there are no rides available.</review>

<Review>Very cool Castle on the bank of Emerald Bay. We've always hiked there as it's gorgeous there.

They have a small visitor center where you can get food/drinks (snacks really) and bathrooms.

There's a nice beach as well.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Beautiful hike, but keep in mind it is going back be a little taxing for those not in shape or if the weather is warm
Definitely should take some water with you.  If you forgot  the store at the bottom sell water and Gatorade (not always cold on hot days, sine since everyone is buy them when it is warm out). I have been told there is a longer trail back up, but we have yet to try it.

Tour is $15 which all goes back into keeping Vikingsholm maintained.

The beach in the summertime can get crowded early.
You can also rent kayaks and SUP by the hour with discounts for multiple hours. You can kayak over the island to see the Tea House.<//Review><username>Robert June</username>< Rate>

Great place to explore in the summer. Some easy but very scenic hiking trails leading to it. Nice picnic tables right on the water to eat lunch if you bring it with. The waterfall above it are amazing to see.</Review>

It was a bit of a disappointment for us. Learn good history but don't get to see the best parts, just lots of small bedrooms, and not as much Scandinavian carvings and design as we would have liked to have seen.....especially considering the hike back up, which is a killer for even the fittest people. Beach there is nice though, and there are beautiful little waterfalls all the way down ( at least until now which is June ) not sure about later in the year though.< /Text>

<text>Emerald Bay area is just awesome. Water is quite cold but if you enjoy swimming and even snorkeling, I highly recommend the beach by Vikingsholm, the water is super clear and clean and there's a lot of cool stuff to see for snorkeling. It's a mile hike down to get there and a mile hike back up, kinda rough, but it's not too bad, a moderate level of steepness.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1593214787577</Time><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>105517983247807433146<//UserId.><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>It's beautiful and the history is very unique. Besides that's where I got married. Morning is best if you can make it. The morning sun is so warm and very beautiful. The sunlight shines up the castle rock and the grounds are at their best. The Godfather was filmed there. The clean-up was amazing. Didn't mess around with the natural beauty. The most photographed area of Lake Tahoe! Parking and tourists information about Emerald Bay.< /Text>< Date>

Relatively short hike. The hike back up is a bit steep so be ready for that. Brings some shorts and a towel so you can take a dip at the lake!< /text>

History says it all.  The visitors center was closed, so didn't get to tour the inside of the house.  However the walk around the house and the beach was worth the mile hike down and back up.<//review>

<Text>Absolutely stunning home.  Emerald Bay is beautiful.  Breath taking.  Be aware if you want to visit this historical home...it cost $10 to park and is very hard to find parking there.  We had to park on the side of the highway about a half mile away.  Once you get to the trail head its about a mile down hill to the house and beach.  You know what that means, right?  It's a mile UP hill back.  With tired cranky children it can challenging.  Bring a stroller if you can.</Text>< date>

<Text>Pack water!!! No way in or out without a boat or hiking. There is a paved road but only state park employees and volunteers can drive it. The hike is 1.6 miles on the paved road (steep walk back) . The Rubicon trail from the state park is 1.7 miles on a Rocky, muddy, dirt trail with ups and downs. Its a nice hike if you are prepared for it. (We had sandals on so it wasn't very pleasant.) I think the state should allow a shuttle service to use the paved road. It would be a good way to earn money for the state parks. There is a very limited selection of cold drinks at the tiny shop (provided they keep it stocked up and cold- they use a mini fridge)<//Text>< pics>

Tickets were $15 per person for the "Mansion" and quite frankly it's really small. Not at all what we had imagined. Also, just so you know...you must hike down to get to this location from the top of Emerald Bay. There are some free parking spaces off the road but are very limited. Main parking is $10 for the day. The hike is pretty steep coming up. Do not recommend taking strollers. Road is rocking and space at beach is very limited. Perfect place for kayaking and paddleboarding.<//text>

Neat castle at he base of Lake Tahoe in Emerald Bay State Park. You can hike down to it without a reservation but you can't tour it without. Also, it was a treat to see a real sod roof!< /Review>

I love coming here. The trails are perfect for an afternoon hike. The history here and house are really awesome.
Good luck parking in the summer though. :(<//review>

<response>None<//response><review>Vikingsholm is a great place to visit, offering beautiful architecture and a fascinating story behind its creation (no Viking colony on Lake Tahoe, sorry).

It seems like most people drive here but we arrived from the water, beaching the boat right in front of Vikingsholm during a day of exploring Emerald Bay and Fannette Island.

Make sure to bring your camera as you'll definitely want to take pictures of this place!</review>< rating>

<Text>WOW....the views on the drive to Vikingsholm and the hike were incredible. Take the Vikingsholm tour (about $36 for a family of four) and learn some pretty cool history of the home and property surrounding the whole area. Make sure you complete your tour of Vikingsholm and then head to a simple but beautiful hike to Eagle Falls, which is just down a path from the castle.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Really nice hike down to the water, and the house is beautiful. The park service warns that the path is very steep, and while this is true it is much easier going down than it is coming back up, so be prepared for that. The hike back up to the parking lot is much harder because of the consistent grade, bring water and wear comfortable shoes. The house is only open for tours between memorial day and September 30th, but even if you can't go inside it's still worth a trip. The exterior architecture is very intricate, and there's no other buildings quite like this anywhere in the US that I know of.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This place is cool! Unfortunately, due to the covid-19 they weren't doing a full tour.  They have an abbreviated one. $5.00 for adults and it's only outside.  Well worth the walk down to Emerald bay. It's beautiful!< /Review>< Rating>

This probably deserves a 5-star rating, but the place was not open for tours thanks to covid. Somehow they manage to keep the gift shop open though! We met very nice volunteer staff there.
The VikingHolm hike down to the castle was nice and fairly short. But the real attraction is the hike around Emerald Bay; Rubicon.< /text>

Just go and see if you're passing by. There is a small hike downhill required to get to this beautifully located Scandinavian style home, but it's definitely worth it.< /Text>

The views from the top rocks are amazing, the walk down to the house and emerald Bay is easy, wide and well trafficked. Other activities around make the day pass worth it: waterfall, trails, old lighthouse, jumping off the dock, etc.< /Review>

What a cool castle to see after enjoying the view of Emerald Bay from above and then walking down the trail. There is a tour to see the inside of the castle and get detailed accounts of its history. We didn’t do it due to our time limitations. However we were able to enjoy the little shore line area and relax for a bit amongst the many tourists and or residents that came too. The walk back to the parking lot was uphill so be prepared for that. The pathway is not paved so wear appropriate footwear for this. I’ve see a few people slip.<//review>

It's pretty amazing to imagine that kind of wealth in the early 1900's (and apply it to today's economy)<//review>

Okay, this place will appeal to many people. Exercise enthusiasts (that mile climb back up is NO JOKE), but especially history buffs and fans of Scandinavian (Viking) design and artifacts. Not to mention it is on the drop dead gorgeous Emerald Bay beach. The hike up almost gave me a heart-attack, but I'd do again again anytime to see that house and lounge in the area. Next time I'm going in by boat, though...<//Review>

<review>Get there before 10:00 a.m. to make sure you get a parking spot unless you want to park along the road.  It's a mile walk down and a pretty steep walk up but it's all on relatively even surface.   They have a small gift shop at the bottom that has some ice cream and water.  There are also restrooms but no water in the restrooms.

The tour of Vikingsholm was 30 minutes long and a guide provided a brief history of the family and property.  You could look into the rooms but only were able to enter one.  Still, it was worth it to us and we enjoyed Inspiration Point, a hike up to Cascade Falls and a visit to Vikingsholm.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMie6gEjbrAnAX7Cvbss2ODjso2gnkelfD7f5fj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSrUlcyh_XjNMXmtmMb2LGQq9IBcudLs_xDqX7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfd6VsT9iVmbHpJ2S16Z0EvE5R7rbBh-fBpqb9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

My favorite experience from my most recent Tahoe trip. You park on the road and walk down to the castle on the lake. The building has been beautifully preserved both inside and out. The tour guide was knowledgeable and friendly. I loved having some time to explore in my own. An amazing slice of history!</text>

The lake view from the top of the hike before you get to Vikingsholm is a sight to see. Hiking is a great part of this adventure, plus there is other trails nearby.< /Review>

The grounds afford a lovely view and access to Lake Tahoe, with a small beach area, picnic area, and access to kayak, paddle board/boat rentals for those who want to check out the Tea House on the island. Well worth a visit!<//Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Definitely worth the hike!! Unfortunately the options for anyone physically disabled are not good: my 80 year old grandma has trouble walking due to hip and back issues, and when she asked what the options were for a handicapped person she was told anyone who needs special assistance needs to call almost a month in advance to have a wheelchair ready, as there are none on sight. My grandma decided to tough it out and successfully made it down and up the hill! She was so happy to tour the home again, as this was her first trip to tahoe in 20 years. I hope we can bring the rest of our family back with us next year!<//Text>< Date>

<Review>The hike to the location is fine coming down but going up it is a mission especially if you are not used to the elevation.

Vikingsholm is a nice place to tour. The price is $15 per adult but worth it to see the castle.

The view of emerald bay is worth the trip in it's self.< /Review>< user>

< Review>
Walking a bit farther than what is expected is not worth it because there is not much to see there. Just only this cottage which is closed and no other stuff to do there. Probably it will only take you 20mins to just sit and rest there when visiting between winter-spring season.< /Review>

Wow what a history! The tour takes 10$per adult and was thinking of not doing it but glad I did...

Must to do if you hike down there.. parking is 10$ again but if you camp near by it’s free with that ticket displayed.<//Text>

<text>This place is on beautiful Emerald Bay.  We took the tour and we're disappointed not to go in because of COVID restrictions, but that's how it goes.  The architecture was interesting and you can't beat the setting.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>A nice 2 mile hike for families with moderate elevation.  The trail goes from a parking lot to the Vikingsholm mansion and beach.  It is partially shaded by tall pine trees and cliffs, and several streams cross under it at different points.  The house is closed in winter but is still worth visiting to see it from outside. It's a very unusual medieval-style Nordic mansion constructed around a courtyard and with a partial sod roof.  The beach is very inviting with some picnic benches and a pier.  The neighboring island can be visited by boat (in summer I presume) but you aren't allowed to swim there.< /text>< gmap_id>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>Going back in time to feel the gentle calm in part of Tahoe history. The architecture is intriguing, beautiful, artistic, understated Norwegian Castle with it's modesty as opposed to palatial extravagance. So if you're expecting grandiose, save the trip, if you're looking for a melancholy walk back in time to learn a piece of history and love for the appreciation of natural beauty, it's a must see. The restrooms are provided but be warned, they're the pits!

Access from the road above with a nice hike down or you can boat in and come to shore with a nice hike to the waterfalls. The home was closed due to covid restrictions so I have no insight on the inside.</Text>

<text>Although it was quite a hike to get to (especially on the way back up, 1 mile up hill) the staff were great, friendly and accommodating. It was worth it. Breathtaking views! Easy process and the equipment was reliable and easy to use. Make sure you leave some energy for thr hike back up hill! We (3 kids and i) rented one kayak and a paddle board for a full day. We arrived at 12p and brought it back at 5p. Exhausting but exhilarating!  Nice beach and peir was fun to jump off of! Water was beautiful...just like Hawaii...can see through to the bottom.< /text>< pictures>

While we are unable to go into the castle because it was closed the beach and scenery is fantastic. Detract down the mountain isn't horrible neither is the trick going back up.</Review>

Amazing place to visit! I will definitely have to go back. The hike was great, with a huge waterfall on the way. The building is beautifully constructed and it is very well maintained. From what I understand the guides actually stay in the home for parts of the year.< /review>

<Text>The home is lovely. The history of it is very interesting.  Lake Tahoe is stunning from any view.  The tour guide was very informative. It is definitely worth the hike down to it. But remember what goes down has to get back up the hill.  It may be too much for some.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Very nice trail. Walking down from the parking area the scenery is beautiful. There are plenty of trail maps, and several ways to get to other trails. Make sure to bring water/snacks, especially if you're visiting after the visitor center is closed.< /review>

Scandinavian castle stand right on the lake shore of Emerald Bay, Lake Tahoe. This spot is located western bound of the beautiful lake, and about 30mins drive from downtown Tahoe South (regardless of peak season traffic). Which the city is the biggest commercial centre with loads of quality hotels to stay.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><response>None< /response><text>Absolutely amazing! What a great way to spend a few hours. The trail down to Vikingsholm is nice and shaded with fantastic views. It is fine for beginning hikers but may be a little too long for little kids on the way back to the parking lot. Vikingsholm itself was incredible and we spent a good chunk of time looking at the craftsmanship and the original decor. Loved hearing all the details from the tour guide as well. Would definitely recommend!!< /text>< name>

<Text>Trail is all down hill to the Viking style home.  Nice gift shop, I bought several items.  Played on the dock for a few minutes and dangled my feet in the water before heading back up the hill.  Don't let the sparkles in the water"fool" you--it's not real gold.  Then all up hill on the way back.  You can do it if you go easy and take a few breaks now and then.< /Text><Name>Cindie W</Name>< Rate>

<review>Beautiful old mansion based on Scandinavian architecture. Awesome layout. Beautiful river is close. It is a fairly long hike to get there (one mile) and the hike back isnt easy. Not rough, just steep. Stop and catch your breath. Plan your day so it isn't closed (inside) when you get there. And (paid) parking is limited so get there early. Hours were 10:30 to 4:30, seasonally for guided tour.  You might want to confirm. Kayak rental nearby. Pack water and snacks. Highly recommended!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Not as big as I had imagined but overall impressive. A lot of history to be learned. The hike up and down to the location was an experience. It was nice hike and it makes you appreciate the world and its wonders. The house was small but very nice.<//Text>

Nice relaxing hike. Easy to walk down as gravity assists, on the way back up gravity adds work. There's a part of the trail that passes right in front of Eagles Fall. Most enjoyable.</Text>

Love the scenery got to kayak to the island. Hike down is not bad. But going up it's hard it's very steep and it feels like an eternity to get to the top especially when it's like 80°-90°hot, just take it really slow. Stay hydrated cool off  on the little creek water</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Beautiful Castle and beach! You have to park  at the top of the hill at an overlook which requires payment. Then, you hike down a steep trail quite a ways to the castle which lies next to the shore. The Castle was closed when I visited, but the outside views are absolutely gorgeous. (There are tours during summer which require payment as well.) You can see the island in the bay from the beach and walk around the castle. The nature and animals in the area were wonderful as well. There were geese on the beach, jays following us around the building and even a few chubby chipmunks hanging out along the path. The park ranger was friendly as well. Overall, the place was beautiful and welcoming. I highly recommend the hike to see it!< /review>< Pictures>

We got to see this place just from outside as it was closed for the season when we went there. But even from outside, it was beautifully built and gives a feel of fort.
You have to walk down the trail to reach this place and is located right next to the lake. The whole trail and the area around it is very beautiful.</text>

Beautiful, and in a peaceful part of the forest.  Not to mention it is right next to eagle falls.  I live 5 miles away from here and still love going to see is multiple times a year.<//Review>

Beautiful scenery of lake and mountains the thing I would like to mention though is the hike back to the parking center is very inclined and I would not recommend people with disabilities or health issues to hike, other than that if you want to hike around I recommend you do< /text>

Dope place to hike down to emerald place. Lots of people will tell you that the hike back up is intense. Not intense at all it’s nicely paved about a mile down and a mile back up. Don’t let the locals steer you away from checking this place out. Parking can be a little challenging make sure to get their early. They charge ten bucks to park at this place if you are savvy you can park on the main road just make sure not to park in areas where it says no parking< /Review>

Interesting and beautiful! We came by in early November which is off season but it was a very pretty (small) hike which would be really easy for any healthy person (not a fattycakes like me who nearly collapsed on the way back) 😹 don't be deterred! It's very pretty and mysterious. I want to come back to kayak in emerald Bay!!</text>

<Text>Easy walk down and slightly winded slower walk up. But so worth it. The views are amazing. Parking can be tough on a weekend. If you do the 1 mile down walk give yourself enough time to enjoy the beach, house and forest at the bottom. I didn't get to see the inside of the house. Tours are during summer months. But outside is still cool to see. There is a parks bathroom at the bottom. We will be going back.< /Text>< userid>

The home was closed when we arrived due to our visit during the off season, but the scenery around the home was incredibly beautiful, with and steep tree covered mountains and crystal clear waters surrounding a rustic wooden jetty.
The good thing about visiting here during the off season was that we had these views all to ourselves for at least half an hour!< /review>

I just loved visiting this Scandinavian "castle" located in such scenic landscape of South Lake Tahoe, .CA.  Not to mention the history that led to its construction and Mrs Knight's determination and charity Works. A very positive  example of impecable administration in the corporate world..<//text>

Lake Tahoe’s Emerald Bay State Park is very beautiful. During the summer, Vikingsholm makes Emerald Bay even better. Visiting Vikingsholm is like stepping back into European history. Once you finish the twisty steep one-mile hike from Highway 89 to Vikingsholm, you will be in one of the most beautiful [laces in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.<//text>

Totally worth it for the $10 tour of the inside, if you're any sort of a history or architecture buff. Otherwise, enjoy walking around the beautiful trees that go straight up to the coastline of Emerald Bay.

This place gets pretty busy on nice days, so plan on doing this in the morning if you want to avoid crowds.< /Text>

Must visit for those who love history and gorgeous homes. The hike is steep in some places to reach, but well worth it for those willing to make the trek. The tour is also incredible and interesting. We hiked down, did a tour, and had picnic by the beach on the grounds. It was the highlight of our trip to Tahoe!< /Review>

<text>Moderate to easy 1-mile hike. Parking can be a challenge depending on your arrival time. Sweeping vistas, crystal blue Tahoe water, and the Nordic themes of Vikingsholm make this a definite must-do. Even if you don't go to Vikingsholm itself, it is perfect for a family picnic or date day.<//text>< pictures>

This is a VERY long walk down to the bottom (1mi on a down/up slope). If you are going to this make sure you pay for all day parking! Do not do one hour as that only gives you enough time to get down there and back!!!< /Review>

The tour is quite informative without being boring, and the area is really lovely! The walk down to the lakeshore and the house is very manageable, but the return uphill has quite a steep grade. Bring a water bottle!< /Text>

<text>Easy one mile walk to the beautiful house. Not a "castle" by any definition, but a stunning Scandinavian inspired house in an incredible location. House is closed through the winter until Memorial Day. Lower eagle falls is just past the house. Beach offers beautiful views of Emerald Bay and the tea house. Must see if in Lake Tahoe.<//text>< Pics>

Absolutely gorgeous. The beach is stunning and the house is incredible. Worth the trek!! The walk is a mile down and a mile back. Going down is easy, up is harder especially in a hot day as the trail is a little steep.< /Review>

Great area to take in Lake Tahoe, they do charge you $10 to park, and then another $10 after your hike to see inside the castle, there is a little boat dock.  You can also rent some kayaks.  The water is Uber cold.</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Historic building,  if you enjoy California and lake tahoe history it is a nice tour.  There is a 1 mile walk to the lake and building.  Not bad going down. But going back up may be a struggle if you are not ready for it.  Some spots are steep and I saw a few groups really struggling. Carry your own water. It is not available at the bottom.
Parking is a problem.  The small lot ($10 charge) fills up early and you have to park on the highway and walk.  We got there at noon and had a 1/2 mile walk just to get to the trail.< /Review><gmap_id>0x809986f8cb869efd:0xd79554c750511182</gmap_id><name>Bill Burke< /name>< time>

Very neat place. I would suggest taking the 30 minute tour while you are down in this location. A bit of a hike but it is well worth it. After this I was just doing some kayaking to the Castle Island.< /review>

Beautiful views. It was cold at the parking lot in May, but was much better on the trail as you go lower. The hike back up may warm you up. There is a public rest room on the trail.< /review>

The Vikingsholm has a lot of typical Scandinavian details, which I have seen a lot during my trips to Norway and Sweden. There is a parking lot at the top, where you have to pay $10 for a day card. From there you walk down the path to the house where you will pass some beautiful pine trees. There is also a small beach and the Eagle waterfall comes out into the lake just a small walk after the house. A really nice stop when you are driving around the lake.</Review>

Loved the trek to reach this location. Too steep and you need to be in good shape otherwise it will take more time to finish the trail. Also carry lots of water with you.  If you can carry portable easy to carry tent take it with you. There is enough space to layout and relax while enjoying the view. May also carry some snacks as you wont be climbing back up soon. Spends atleast few hours once you reach down. I suggest trekking poles will support your walk....overall wonderfull experience..i would say all day trip...</text>

Smaller house and shorter tour than we expected. Adjacent Eagle Falls are worth the walk down but I would not recommend spending $15pp on the tour.< /review>

Beautiful mansion. We hiked in from Bliss State Park on the Rubicon Traill, about 4 miles away.   The Emerald State Park parking lot was full.  Get there early and have alternate parking options in mind ahead of time.  The trail was difficult for me (sedintary), but easier for my husband (walks everyday).   The trail was beautiful, it even went down to the water at one point.  Got some ex$pen$ive ice cream treats at the ticket office.  After the hike, the Haagen-Dazs was heavenly and worth every penny.
Emerald Bay was gorgeous especially as seen from the trail.  The water is beautiful, and the tour is a nice rest before heading back.  Give yourself time to enjoy this beautiful area.< /text>

It has been years since we lived at Lake Tahoe. Boating to the home and to the Tea house on the Island was one of our favorite things to do. I hope they still have the Tour of the home.< /review>

It is a mile and a bit downhill walk to Emerald Bay and the mansion that was built back in the 1800's. Way ahead of its time with electricity, running water, servants quarters and an Downton Abbey feel.</text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>A quaint and very unique home/castle right on the shores of Emerald Bay.  You can get here by boat, kayak, hiking the Rubicon trail, or from the main road above (parking area day permit required) and then hike down on a somewhat steep but short trail.  Vikinsholm is available to see by buying a tour either at the next door visitor center or by purchasing one of the local guided boat tours.  Bring your camera, extra water, snacks, and swimsuits if you want to take a dip in the bay and spend a little time on the very small beaches.  Most people just wear their swimsuits and hike in. There is a restroom, but I don't think there was any running water.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809986f8cb869efd:0xd79554c750511182< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Gives you that old haunted house feeling, even though there are 38 rooms they are quite small and crampy with all the furnishing. Best view is the gorgeous emerald bay at the front on the place. Can't imagine what must the owner felt walking out the front door and into the bay each morning. Best to go there by boat otherwise it's a long 2 miles hike to the place especially in a hot summer day! Definitely not for older folks because of the difficult path.</Review>

< Review>
Great hike! I'd recommend going in the morning between May- Sept when you can take a tour of the mansion. Hike back up later in the day can be difficult if you're not dressed to hike. (aka: don't wear jeans! Lol!)

Also, I'm a lil outta shape...it's good cardio. While you're at the lake you can also take a boat ride or just paddle board, kayak or fish. No bikes or pets allowed so leave them at home for this one. 4/5 ⭐'s.< /Review>

A nice place hidden in the Tahoe wilderness. Not a good place for young kids, the tour and things to see are good for adults, but extremely boring for kids.< /Review>

<text>It takes about 30 minutes to walk down the steep path to get to this place but it's worth it. The house and its surroundings are fabulous and I've never seen trees as large as this before. You're right on the waters edge and can see lots of wildlife running about. Take drinks and something to eat as the onsite shop sells a few candy bars and chips and that's about it. The walk back up is a bit of a killer and seems to go on for ages so get plenty of refreshments before you start heading back up</text>< rating>

Great sight to see but horrible parking, not enough and costs 10 bucks. The path doesnt allow dogs. Park just down at eagle falls, (which DOES allow dogs) for 5 bucks and walk back, though its still limited there.</text>

Worth the hike down from parking lot return trip can be tough. What you carry down you have to carry up a steep 1 mile hike back up. That goes for small children, if you can't carry them don't go.</Text>

Historical place, we came across a bear, was terrified as it was as close as 5 meters away. The hike to this place is 2 miles round trip and has beautiful views of the lake tahoe and the fanette island.< /Review>

Didn't manage to visit the room when I was there in April 2018 (temperature 10c)

The building is cleverly designed in the circle.<//Text>

It's a gorgeous place but for those really out of shape be wary of the hike up. Note: parking is really limited around the area.</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Located on the shores of Lake Tahoe, the access is made by a very steep descent which cannot be accessed by car, it is just a very old style cabin that presents some objects of the time but it is not worth going to the place because of it exactly what really matters is the lake and the natural beauty that is found in the place the most annoying problem is the long walk because there is no parking nearby

(Original)
Situada às margens do lago Tahoe,  o acesso é feito por uma descida bem íngreme a qual não se pode ter acesso de carro é apenas uma cabana estilo bem antiga que apresenta alguns objetos da época mas não vale a pena ir ao local por causa dela exatamente o que importa sim é o lago e a beleza natural que se encontra no local o problema mais chato é a grande caminhada pois não há  estacionamento próximo</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< GmapID>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Great view of the lake from the observation deck at the parking lot. And only 15 minutes of descent to the lake along a picturesque path. Now it is impossible to enter the house itself, but the taritorium around will fascinate.

(Original)
Прекрасный вид на озеро со смотровой площадки у парковки. И всего 15 минут спуска к озеру по живописном тракту. Сейчас в сам дом зайти невозможно, но таритория вокруг очаровует.<//Text>< rating>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is a very beautiful place to get out of the busyness of the city and has many places to meet and forget the problems of daily life, nothing like a walk outside to exercise and breathe fresh air. In short, it is extraordinary to find such places. I highly recommend it for nature lovers and those of us who seek to connect with what God gave us.

(Original)
Es un lugar muy hermoso para salir del agetreo de la ciudad y cuenta con muchos lugares para conocer y olvidar los problemas de la vida diaria, nada como un paseo al aire libre para ejercitarse y respirar aire fresco. En pocas palabras es extraordinario encontrar lugares asi. Lo recomiendo mucho para los amantes de la naturaleza y los que buscamos conectarnos con lo que Dios nos dio.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809986f8cb869efd:0xd79554c750511182<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) There is parking, parking is $ 10. There is a road from the parking lot to the lake, the road is easy with children. The descent takes approximately 20 minutes. The place is beautiful and calm. The water is clean, beautiful beach. Unfortunately, it will not be possible to look inside, it is now closed due to the pandemic.

Есть парковка, парковка 10$. С парковки идет дорога к озеру, дорог лёгкая можно с детьми. Спуск занимает примерно 20 минут. Место прекрасное, спокойное. Вода чистая, красивый пляж. К сожалению внутри посмотреть не получится, сейчас из-за пандемии закрыто.< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Located in Emerald Bay State Park, stroll through the Rubicon Trailhead forest by the lake, walk to Emerald Bay, sit and watch the clear lake, waterfowl swimming, and leisurely vacationers.
The privately donated Vikingsholm, like a small local history museum, displays historical relics of local development and is worth visiting. From the trail next to the visitor center, you can climb up to Eagle Falls.

(Original)
位於Emerald Bay State Park，漫步穿過湖畔的Rubicon Trailhead森林，走到Emerald Bay，坐看明淨湖水、水鳥悠遊，以及悠閒渡假的人們。
私人捐贈的Vikingsholm，就像小型的當地歷史博物館，展示本地開發歷史文物，值得參觀。從旁邊遊客中心旁的步道，可以爬上Eagle Falls。<//Review>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>(Translated by Google) In the south of Lake Tahoe in Emerald Bay. Beautiful, people usually go in summer but calm atmosphere. If you leave soon you can take tables to eat there and areas near the water where you are.
Cold water for bathing but the children and the cheerful older bathe. Possibility of renting kayaks $ 25 / double hour.
It is ideal for a good day. On the weekend it must be crowded. In winter, snow.
There is no drinking water and you have to walk 2.5 km to get there. Parking at $ 10 above but you can leave the car in the access roads, be careful not to step on the white line with the wheels of the car.
There is a water jacket in the area before going down from the road to the lake.

(Original)
En el sur del lago Tahoe en Emerald Bay. Precioso, suele ir gente en verano pero ambiente tranquilo. Si se va pronto se pueden coger mesas para comer allí y zonas cerca del agua donde estar.
Agua fría para bañarse pero los niños y los mayores alegres se bañan. Posibilidad de alquilar kayaks 25$/hora dobles.
Es ideal para pasar un buen día. En fin de semana debe estar abarrotado. En invierno, nieve.
No hay agua potable y hay que andar 2.5 km para llegar. Parking a 10$ arriba pero puede dejarse el coche en los arcenes de acceso, tened cuidado de no pisar la raya blanca con las ruedas del coche.
Hay casaca fas de agua por la zona antes de bajar desde la carretera a las orillas del lago.< /Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Wahhhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.
You have to see this blue water; it's amazing; there are great places to look and take photos all over the area; you can go hiking in the mountains nearby. Simply wonderful and incredibly beautiful.
You can do without the tourist camps in the area with the only restaurants by the way. Then you prefer to take sandwiches with you and in the evening in Lake Taohe City (approx. 25 minutes by car) eat a buffet in one of the Casino Resorts. The restaurant in harra's is on the 18th floor with a view of the lake: ) ... enjoy your trip

Wahhhhnnnnsinnn.
Dieses blaue Wasser müsst ihr gesehen haben.es ist unglaublich.in der ganzen Gegend gibt es tolle Orte zum schauen und Fotos machen.angrenzend kann man schön wandern in die Berge. Einfach herrlich und unfassbar schön.
Auf die Touristen camps im Umkreis mit den übrigens einzigen Restaurants kann man verzichten.dann lieber Butterbrot mitnehmen und abends in lake taohe City ( ca 25 minuten Autofahrt) in einem der Casino Resorts Buffet essen.im harra's ist das Restaurant im 18ten Stock mit seeblick:) ...enjoy your trip</Text>

<name>Yolanda A.<//name><Text>(Translated by Google) In the same lake Tahoe.
A wonderful place.
Leave your car on the road, to the side to avoid paying $ 10 for parking (very small). From the parking lot there is a road of 1.5 km approx. that goes down to the lake.
Crystal clear waters and large forest Ideal for children despite the walk.
There are signs that indicate the cold of its waters, but it is not so much, not much more than the water of the beaches of the Costa Brava.
I advise you to pass the beach and look for a more intimate corner.
There are picnic tables throughout the forest.
Next to it is a small waterfall.

(Original)
En el mismo lago Tahoe.
Un lugar maravilloso.
Dejad coche en carretera, a un lado para evitar pagar 10 dólares de parking (muy pequeño). Desde el aparcamiento hay un camino de un 1,5 kilómetro aprox. que baja al lago.
Aguas cristalinas y gran bosque Ideal para niños a pesar de la caminata.
Hay letreros que indican lo frío de sus aguas, pero no es para tanto, no mucho más que el agua de las playas de la costa Brava.
Os aconsejo pasar de largo la playita y buscar un rincón más íntimo.
Hay mesas de picnic a lo largo de todo el bosque.
Al lado está una pequeña cascada.< /Text><gmap_id>0x809986f8cb869efd:0xd79554c750511182</gmap_id>< user_id>
