This place is my number one restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to this restaurant. everytime  I feel like having a fair dinner, this place comes right away to my head. superb and varied  food and a rich menu.generous staff, and good ambience. Also important, the tariff is fair. I recommend this spot with no doubt.<//review>

< review>
First time coming here for lunch after seeing the line outside for the longest time I had to go try it out for myself. I got the Kung Pow Chicken with steamed rice which I thought was a comfrtable spicy. Best Chinese place in SL I've been to so far, it definitly wasn't like some other chinese resteraunts that just overload the oil and the flavor. But this place seems pretty authentic. Nice workers also, they work hard to make the food for all the people getting coming for lunch and dinner<//review>

Carryout only, best to call ahead, bring a bit of patience during peak hours should the quick moving line be long as the food is definitely worth any wait!<//Text>< pictures>

Well I had been driving and driving pass this line for years I think but I finally pulled over to see what was going on.
Within the last 3 weeks I think we have put on 30 lbs Dried Fried Robs , just right  Salt and Pepper Wings  and salt & pepper shrimp on point Chicken chow mein and white rice. The only thing that I didn’t care for was the potstickers other then that it was a hit<//review>

I truly enjoy the quick service and the very tasty dishes that I have ordered here every time me and my family come! Service is quick, prices are super affordable and the lady that runs this joint is hilarious. She always cracks me up, she's quite the character.   Good food and a show...love it!<//Review>

<review>Tried calling in my order, line was busy, got to the window, waited 10 minutes before being help by a very rude guy. Was told my food would be ready in 25-30 minutes. I took a walk to the store, took exactly 28mins, went to the window the guy said my food wasn’t ready, I waited another 15 food still wasn’t ready. I saw people ordering after and leaving before and with way more food. Very disappointed in the service. Food also wasn’t worth the time spent.<//review>< pics>

<review>Honestly my family and I have been coming here for years. Before service was pretty good. The lady who answer the phone and seems to oversees thing's in this establishment is very rude, and very unprofessional. I would like to mention it is the community that has been keeping this place going for many year's. The owner should be more respectful to the families that come here and spend good money with them. I have witness this woman shout at customers and talk to folks in a very disrespectful way because the young lady who answer the phone and take the orders was having a bad day or was the one getting people's orders wrong. Again it is the people of the community, the many families who come to this establishment and spend good money with these people. Myself personally will not come back here and support a place who's rude, and doesn't respect the community that pour out support to help this business thrive. The food is good but I've had better the quality of service sucks, the lack of appreciation that families respect and support your business is a shame. "The lady who answer the phone all the time she know who she is. Needs to be more professional and a bit more educated in servicing the community that helps your business thrive!<//review>< Pictures>

This is a small restaurant that is BIG on taste!!! Their food is really good, and it's reasonably priced. Their house fried rice is Delicious!! I also Love their salt and pepper wings!!! The restaurant is dine in as well as take out. There is not very much parking available since this is a popular eatery. The staff is very friendly, but things can get a little crazy during the lunch/dinner rush.< /review>

<review>Close from Dec 24 to Jan 2, 2016.  I love this little Chinese restaurant.  They say no MSG and I don't taste any.  The young lady is very friendly and make well recommendation on food choice.  Price is cheap, but the food tastes well.  If you like spicy food, you will find a lot of choices.  I am not the fan of it, but still like the food there.</review><user_id>103739417928142577218<//user_id><time>1451421992009</time></record>

<Time>1520541504706< /Time><review>Little Namking changed ownership in December 2017.  The food is now more oily, but the thing that bothers me the most is that the pricing is very inconsistent.  I always order the same thing, but I was charged a different amount each time.

This restaurant used to be packed during lunchtime on weekdays, but not anymore.  I guess the other regular customers finally realized the change in ownership and are not fans of the new Little Namking.

I won't be back anytime soon.<//review></record>

Been coming here for YEARS! Always the same happy owner lady, always busy but food was bomb. She SOLD the restaurant the new owners dont know what they are doing and you can clearly see the food quality went out the door, mongolian beef :the beef was chewy and all fat so dissapoined. Guess it was good while it lasted.</review>

This restaurant has new owner and chefs. The menu is the same as before but the quality of the food has gone down significantly. I was there recently at lunch time and there were no customers, I think this a sign of poor quality and increased prices. I don't recommend this place.<//text>

Love this place. I only get out to see family about once a year. We always go there, and they always remember me. They have matching gel to non gel polish. I like toes done with regular polish, and finger nails done in gel. They have perfect match in both. Top notch service and expertise. My Mani pedis last longer from here, than any other place I go across the entire country. Always clean, always friendly. I always leave happy.< /review>

<Review>I brought my two daughters in with me for a girl's day. This was the first time we had ever been here and we will definitely be back! Kevin did my youngest manicure and taught her as he went about taking care of her nails and how to make them grow. Then a very nice lady named Tina did her pedicure. Andy did my manicure and finished off my pedicure after a lovely woman named Ann did an amazing job on my feet and legs. He was also very knowledgeable and did amazing work! My oldest daughter only had a pedicure, but she was very happy because she has fibromyalgia and planter faciitis and the lady (I forgot to get her name) was very gentle with her! We are all extremely happy and I recommend this place to everyone.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80ea440be3041bf9:0x241dc3f018e4444a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1499832518897</Time><rate>1<//rate><text>Where do I begin? I made an appointment for my wedding party of 8 a week before, she told me they would not call in more staff to help which was fine since it was a Wednesday. Although they had enough staff to take care of us they kept taking people even though there was not enough people to handle more. Long story short, I showed up at 5:15 and did not leave until 10pm, they did me last as the bride and my nails were HORRIBLE! I was SO tired and upset by the time I left I didn't say anything about the horrible job he did, $150 later. The next day I decided to call in, I told the manager I wasnt happy with my nails, they were rushed and it was my wedding and I wanted to get them redone that day, he told Me he thought they were good and didn't have time for me to come back in. When I got upset and told him it was my wedding he said he would just remove the polish. I ended up going to have them redone at a new salon, the lady fixing them could not even believe he allowed me to leave with how horrible they were. My wedding party was not happy with their nails either, it was a total waste of time and money, I will never go back. Also, I should have know when I was warned they take several hours to complete a full set. I do NOT suggest this place if you care about your time or nails.<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The Church is beautiful, the choir is great. The Minister is young but tries hard to present a good message but it is sort of dry. The Church has been closed for over a year. They have one line service but it is just as dry as in person. Sorry to say but God's word is always good. Just how it is presented by him is just sort of boring and redundant. 😥<//Review>

< Review>
Had a vision to come here. Was hesitant as we all saw the documentary "2012". God told me to come here so I put my fears aside and came. Was surprised by the recovery rate from the earthquake. What resilient people. Church was okay. Priest was interested in my credit score. Got out quickly. Assumed the worst. Cat is now convulsing on my front seat. Prayers are not yet helping, keep them coming.<//Review>

I joined this church a couple months ago and they really treat you like family. They were very welcoming and I have gained so much from the embark classes from new members. God really has a presence at this church and the pastors and choir are amazing. Come check it out and see.< /Text>

<Text>Horrible experience at this church.  I simply asked to help me find a place to live, keep in mind I did not need money, just suggestions as to where to look.  Not only was I dismissed by the deacons and the pastor but then I was talked about, me and my family as if we were less than human beings by the congregants of this church.  Their primary concern is how much money you have in your pockets.  The deacon told my coworker to tell me "the church does not deal with worldly things like helping a family find adequate housing" I mplor any one to read Matthew chapter 25 with particular focus on why Jesus seperated the sheep from the Goats.</Text>< Pics>

<text>Stumbled upon this park and found it a great addition to my favorite park list.  It has 2 unique zip line type swings that set this park above the rest.  Also, enjoyed having a restroom and lots of shade area along the street area.  However, it is close to a semi busy street so you will have to keep a watchful eye on the young ones.</text><pics>None< /pics></record>

<review>A great neighborhood park, as usual attached near a school. Lots of things for kids to play on, including a mini simulated rock wall up to a slide. Very good winding path around and through the area for walking or jogging. Lots of grass, grab a blankie and eat a quick bite.< /review><time>1583134162544< /time><gmapID>0x808feda64b990f39:0x4a1e74f46b1b63b7</gmapID><UserId.>107886093212215532048</UserId.>< pics>

Very nice park.  Very low key and relaxing.  They do have a kids play area which is nice too.  I normally walk the track towards the back of the park.< /Review>

<review>This park is kept pretty clean and is usually not very crowded. Public BBQ grills and picnic tables are available, and there are two restrooms near the jungle gym (can't personally vouch for the cleanliness inside since I have never used them, but I see a cleaning lady making her rounds at least once a week). There's also a small sand pit, and shaded benches for parents to sit on while they watch their kids play. Only down side is that street parking may be limited on weekends when there are more families, but it should all still be within a short walking distance.<//review><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808feda64b990f39:0x4a1e74f46b1b63b7< /GmapID></record>

I'd give this park 5 stars if they could ever figure a way to cover the play structures. We could only play for a few minutes because all the equipment was hot. There is tons of grass, and lots of places to settle down for a picnic</review>

<text>Super cute small park. There's 2 different play structures- one for small children and one for older children. There's also a small sand area, swings for littles, swings for older kids, a "zip" line type thing with 2 different options, a horse shoe pit, a volley ball area, and much more! Lots of shade for a picnic and several benches and tables. There's even some nice paved "track" area for kids to ride their bikes around. If your looking for a small park to visit out of your normal routine, give Boone Acres Park a visit!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Great little place not a popular as Athens but it has a cute wandering bike/skate path that goes around the play area covered seating area for it also has a horse shoe pit for the adults.  Currently due to vandalism the restrooms had to be torn down and thankfully they are working diligently rebuilding but in the mean time they has a very large portable rest rooms in place<//review>

Lots of open green grassy space, sports fields, fun play structure equipment fir both tiny tots and older children as well. Plenty of sun, with plenty of shady spots to escape the heat and there's usually a cool breeze in the later afternoons. There's a few benches for us grown ones to watch over and read or secretly play games on our phones, also a few tables and benches for picnics and BBQs...and yes, there are public bathrooms available but I'm fairly certain they're only unlocked during daylight hours.  It is adjacent to Pine Valley Middle school, however I do not believe that they use the heart of the park for recess.< /text>

A smaller park, but it has 2 play structures. One is smaller and more geared to younger/smaller children. The other is larger and more challenging for older/taller children. Decent, maintained restrooms are a bonus.</Review>

< review>
I had a conference in Long Beach that was held here and I thought it was a nice place. We were given a breakfast meal and lunch, not sure where the food came from. The Dumke Room looks like some sort of  senate meeting room. Everything looked clean.< /review>

I think the Chancellor's office needs to look into the mismanagement of money at San Jose State University. We the students were notified on the local news this morning that spring classes are being cut. Apparently there is a deficit of $32 million dollars and next semester they will be overspending by $3.5 million dollars. We the students would like to see the financial records of San Jose State and demand that classes be left open for current students to enroll.< /review>

Horrible experience i placed an online order when I tried to talk to an associate at the store about it no one picked up i even tried calling every department on top of it they are not even answering there pickup line smh .. Plus the girl named Elizabeth that was helping us out was extremely rude and ignored other customers that were already here. We had to knock on the door repeatedly just to get someone's attention. To help us and the girls answer to it was everyone knows what to do and I dont need to ask ummm excuse you have a job and you need to attend to the customers that need help I will be contacting corporate for this issue and whats sad is im not the only customer complaining...:( never again .... If i could put no stars i would<//Text>

Horrible experience. We placed our order 2 days ago and selected today as our pickup date. We received the email stating our order was ready for pick up. Arrived and parked. Turns out that they were running behind almost an hour. We waited almost 2 hours before we left with no groceries. There was no communication from Walmart staff giving us any updates or any reason for the really long delay. There others that had been waiting longer. Extremely disappointed.</text>

<text>Very very poor service at grocery pick up. Their "associates" are rude to customers, the so called "coaches" are even worse. One would think the coaches would be an improvement over their associates who they are supposed to supervise. I would not suggest this store to anyone. Walmart should retrain their entire staff and terminate any who cannot understand that customer service is very important or you get no business.< /text></record></dataset><record>

My pick up time was from 10am to 11am. I arrived at 10:47am and my departure time was around 12:15pm. There was only one Wal-Mart team member bringing out  purchased goods to about 14 cars.
Also I expected to receive substitutes for some items I purchased because I was notified that the store was out of the exact Items I selected but that was not the case. The team member told me the items was not available in store and I should be receiving a refund. I decided to go in the store just to see if the items was in stock and of course majority of the items was in store. I normally go in and select my own items to purchase but I decided to do order pick up for social distancing purposes and this was not a great experience. Now the team member that brought my items to the car was very nice and helpful.<//Text>< Pics>

The pickup employees are so polite and considerate!!!! Very good customer service. The Downey Apollo walmart on the other hand is wayyyyyy too big to not have everything instock. Whoever does the ordering should be fired. I dont see why all of the walmarts don't have the order to pickup service for the groceries. If they did I wouldn't even go to Apollo Walmart.<//Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Dimly lit pick-up area. Associates now call out your name which is a bit off putting because there are others waiting for her or his order. Make sure to double-check items being picked up. Got home & found my waste bin lid was broken, loaves of bread squished beyond repair, & a whole half ham missing from my order. I know due to COVID-19 we are to stay in our vehicles but you may want to make the effort & put your own groceries in your car while checking your ordered items - saves the need of having to call Walmart later for an exchange/refund. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️<//Review>< Pics>

Much better than the last review. I should have checked in with the Walmart App. So, anyone that wants expedited responses, use the Walmart App to check-in.< /Review>

Then a email was sent at 5:30am today and we went to the pick at noon and waited an hour saw many cars waiting to find out from an employee to ask, orders from yesterday were canceled.<//Review>< UserId.>

Worse experience ever. Waited over an hour since there was only 6 pick up spaces and were all full. They have the space to add more pick up spaces. Felt bad that they only had one employee for so many pick ups.</text>

I walked into the shop and was able to speak with one of the Artists right away. Rica is the one who helped me. I had to come back later that day since he was booked which to me, it’s a good sign. I was comfortable being there, I loved the atmosphere and music. I believe I spent about an hour there. Definitely would come back 🙃
Thank you again Rica.<//text>

<Review>I walked in with 2 of my sisters and we were helped right away. Rica did my tattoo and I love it. He had a humorous attitude and did not mind me being so picky given that it was my first tattoo. Made me feel really secure. My two other sisters got theirs done by Nando. AWESOME guy! Gave them exactly what they wanted and took his time. The people here are so kind and welcoming, makes you almost feel like family.< /Review><Name>Brenda Alvarado< /Name>< Gmap_id>

Great place to get a tattoo. My son went there and was happy with the artist and the price. With so many tatoos parlors around now a days it's hard to find a good place that'll take good care of you and not charge you to much. So I totally recommend this tattoo parlor. . .< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>My husband and I went there today to get his wings on both of his arm done with Rica. When we first arrived there we were welcomed by Pabo who was working on another client tattoo, but he made sure to acknowledge and let us know our tattoo artist was going to come out shortly. Pabo was friendly and professional and I saw his artwork on his client which was absolutely gorgeous. When Rica finally came to us he to was very professional and friendly. My husband was nervous getting both of his arms tatted at the same time, but Rica was patient and gentle with him. Now the aftermath of how my husbands tattoo turned out was amazing and very well detailed. This will be our permanent ink stop shop. I highly recommend Pabo and Rica they are the best in town and if you live far it is definitely worth the trip and distant to get quality and great customer service.< /text><UserId.>117666066987877996942<//UserId.><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb2cd817746a5:0xb5e6721f678f2b75< /gmap_id>< Date>

<Review>Went to this place today to get a small tattoo and found the artist to be very unprofessional so we walked out. Firstly, the tattoo artist were taking about male genitalia in a very explicit way not caring there were female customers present. Secondly, I was there for about 35min in which the guy who was supposed to do my tattoo took 5 minutes to prep and about thirty minutes to simply have a conversation with everyone else in the shop. We were literally just standing there waiting to get work done while he was simply talking about chicken recepies to everyone else ignoring us completely as if we were to be attended when he felt like. We walked out we felt super disrespected and we will never recoment this place to anyone ever.<//Review>< Date>

<text>We stopped at 4 tire shops till we got to Al's Tire shop, no one would help us until Al's. None of the other tire shops cared that we might get stuck on the side of the road. Cody and Spencer actually cared about their job and wanted to help us. Spencer was amazing, he refused to quit until he got the job down right. Spencer didn't come across as just an employee but he seemed like an owner who cared about the reputation of this business. They saved us hundreds of dollars and if we ever need work within 50 miles, we will travel to Al's for the great service. Very honest and trustworthy.< /text><Time>1592588891821<//Time>< GmapID>

Great guy!  Helped me out when i almost had a blowout.  Charged me only $25 for a tire when it was an emergency!  Was honest and to the point.  Friendly employees that make you feel welcomed even when you seem like an airhead  blonde in a BMW<//Text>

< Review>
Went out specifically just for dinner because this Lodge has the best damn 👨🏾‍🍳 Chef around! Mr. Ralph is one hell of a cook! Hats off to you sir🎩. MmmmMmm, that steak and Alaskan Halibut was excellent for a Friday meal so I would most definitely recommend if you haven't experienced the Lodge yet. Member or Not, go indulge in that menu because I can pretty much guarantee there's something for everyone on that menu👌. There was also live music playing and the band crushed it. Great evening! 🕺🏽💃🏽<//Review>

<review>The cuisine is real Jaliciense Mexican food.  No cheddar or jack cheese here.  This is not "Pocho" food.  It is truly the best Mexican food in East L.A.   The outdoor patio is enchanting and dog friendly!< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<UserId.>117359000018031801231</UserId.><Date>1530814101084</Date><Text>I spotted this restaurant because of its sign on the sidewalk, "Birria estilo Jalisco". I was excited to try this food and I was hungry. They have a small parking lot in the back and you can enter the restaurant through the back as well. I must say I was not let down. I ordered the Birria for breakfast, yes birria, I didn't finish it ofcourse but it was delicious. They start you off with chips and salsa while you look at the menu. They have a good selection of drinks and food, and the prizes are affordable. El agua de Jamaica is very tasty too. I noticed a  milkshake blender; I'll definitely be coming back for one of those.<//Text><name>Jessica S. Edwards<//name><resp>None< /resp>< pics>

This place was packed when we got there. I was surprised as we are going through a pandemic. The restaurant looked to it's full capacity.
The food was okay nothing special. We ordered some appetizers fish tacos and a combination plate.
The decor was also okay.
The staff, however, did an EXCELLENT job!  The lady at the front putting people on the waitlist was very friendly and attended to us right away. Our waiter was also amazing. He was very knowledgeable, helpful, and attentive.
So what they fall short in in other things, they make up for in their staff. I would come back just because of the service.
The live music, although you had to pay for it, was also really great!<//Review>

<review>So I enjoy the fact that this restaurant is open and standing for small businesses. The food was good but it made me so bloated I felt nauseous the rest of the night. Maybe too much salt? The reason I'm giving it three stars is because all the food is super expensive and it's basic Mexican food. A kid's meal is nearly $10 and that's including a cheese quesadilla, rice and beans. I could buy all the ingredients to make that for maybe $6 at the store and have left overs for 3 days. San Diego is really bumming me out with all these high-priced Mexican food restaurants; that's why my husband refuses to go to them. We only dined here because a friend from work wanted to go here so we we're not going to decline. I would say I enjoyed our waitress Elizabeth and she was really kind to my son and we enjoyed the evening.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Lots of seating so rarely a wait, at least for very long. Decent amount of parking. Usually, quick service. Good chips, great salsa, including the green. Food is very good with good portions. You'll be full or too full if you're not careful. Prices are very reasonable.<//Review>

There is  *vegetarian menu for those that are wondering. It's pretty extensive, too Cheese enchiladas, vegetable burritos, potato tacos with beans and rice plus many more options. They can also tweak most things on the menu to be made vegetarian- even vegan when requested.</Review>< Pics>

As far as Mexican food goes, so close to the boarder, I would classify this place as serving quasi-Mexican food. The food was edible, but for a "Fine" Mexican Restaurant I was looking for a bit more flavor and more authenticity. I have paid less for so much better, on both sides of the boarder.</Text>

Despite what the name of dear “Murrieta” might suggest, this place is exactly what it appears: a family style Mexican restaurant designed for the suburban crowd. Their chips and salsa are a notch above average, as well as the guacamole, but the fish ceviche I ordered tasted like a flavorless tomato salad.

Grandmothers come here to get drunk off of the big margaritas. There’s a bar in back for Padres fans.<//Text>

Looks can really be deceiving. Stopped by for lunch, parking lot was pretty full which led me to believe the food must be good. I ordered the enchiladas rancheras and it was absolutely awful; completely overloaded with way too much cheese and a sloppy dollop of sour cream. The food did not taste fresh, flavorful, or seasoned at all. It was overall a very poor and sloppy presentation of what is considered to be authentic Mexican food. I certainly will not return to dine at this restaurant ever again. Not happy that I wasted money on a meal from this place.</Text>

Food is over priced and not great. The drinks taste different every time I come and the salsa is really watery. Good luck figuring out the hours of this place. Tried to come on a Friday for brunch... the door and website say they open at 10 am. Phone message says they open at 9 am... Google maps says 11 am. Showed up at 10:30 and they don’t open till 11 am. My friend and I meet here for a margarita then go eat food somewhere else.<//review>

The food and service were both pretty good. The chips were warm and the salsa was spicy which is always a bonus. Based on the flavor of the salsa, we expected our food to be spicier than it was, but it actually could have used a little more flavor. The serving size was smaller than expected, but that meant you could actually eat the meal without feeling sick after. The servers were prompt when we asked for things, but weren't around as often as we wanted them.</review>

I'm sorry but I have to leave a review this time. I have been to this place many times. I didn't like it the first time so I gave  it a second chance and the outcome was the same. All the other times I've been there was because someone I knew was having an event there. Don't call it a Mexican restaurant when it doesn't taste authentic. The food is tasteless, the texture is off, the combination they use for  plating is wrong it ruins the food and the prices are high for the food quality. It's sad that people think this is how Mexican food taste like until they go to one of there Chicanos friends house and they taste the real deal and all of a sudden they feel like dancing latino style, there stomach is having a fiesta, their taste buds are going wild with all the flavors they're tasting. There are no mariachis there but they here them in their heart welcoming them to a new beginning of real latino food. Keep it real. Adios amigos.< /review>

Food is great. Reason for 3 stars. When I first arrived to this restaurant. I had a party of 12 which i knew we would have to have 2 two and the seater informed me as well. As we were getting seated. We were placed to a party of 14 at one table. Not really a problem but whatever. My party and I weren't offered drinks for roughly over 15 minutes after we sat down. Finally got a server (Hugo) and he was great and made sure we were taking care of. If it wasnt for him this place would be a 2.</Text>

Since dining is limited, Murrieta's had really improved their quality of taste. Ample outside dining. Service is fast, friendly and accommodating. Traditional and authentic Mexican food. Full service bar with go m flavorful choices of Margaritas. Good for dates, families, happy hour, and dinner. Cash, cards and compliments accepted. Wait time 0-10 minutes. Plenty of parking. Too:  Ask for extra sauce on enchiladas.<//Review>

This place was okay. I felt like my chimichanga was smaller than I am used to getting. Their salsa seemed watered down but the chips where good. My friend ordered a burrito with no guac due to her allergies. They added guac. Okay, no problem... We sent it back and asked again "no guac please." She got her burrito but the size was significantly smaller than the other one and it seemed like someone just slapped on some rice and beans. My rice was shaped really nicely (like when you use a mold to shape it). Also, she didn't even get sour cream or lettuce or cheese like the burrito with guac. She didn't get new silverware either. The server literally just dropped off her new burrito and said it was the chefs fualt. Dude, take accountability! As a server you should have double checked that the order was right especially if a customer has a food allergy. I don't think this was a deal breaker for me, I will probably come here again and give it another shot. I'm trying to support small restaurants and businesses.</review>

<text>This is an excellent Mexican restaurant to eat at. The wait time wasn’t bad for 5 people it was our first time in Cali as well. The booths are nice as well nice and open atmosphere. The prices aren’t too bad either my wife and spent $45 so that’s too bad.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNm4es8UHr84D4-Hurkxmzp2W05PvE2_HC0bIVH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpAN8CdlAmXddoKXlRqYGe2-GvRv4Am6RX_k8M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeUqDCT0rn6Q_hBYgpUSboAScdsGoZgr-A-Eeu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6iIkPWx1JwIzJdujXebTMgXVtKvwHVt_y8Kki=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMns1etZ4ZY10eJUZN9M2ic1RDYbORPb4PZKcJ1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7ORgvzXm1bYyIIwSaLN3BQUtGQC-2tfOTMzba=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Love the environment and employee service! I think they may need more staff and maybe add two baskets of chips, not one! Seating is fast but parking is limited! I felt that the food was not incredibly special need more to impress me other than the usual Mexican dish! But staff is friendly and caring! Love the authentic environment!< /text>

Poor food quality, the plate with beans and rice was so overcooked in microwave it was hard. We ordered the molcajete for 2 and literally got 4 pieces of shrimp, the meat had no taste and it was mostly chicken. Very dissapointed.<//review>

Murrieta's hasn't changed since I was young. Off and on my parents would take the family to Murrieta's after church on Sunday. The place was always hoping. Just like it was back then it was hoping when I took my parents there to eat.
The food was good. I decided to have what I got when I was a kid, the cheese enchiladas, and it tasted just the same. The ambiance was also the same, minus all the covid restrictions, if it wasn't for that I would have felt like it was a Sunday evening just like all those years ago. Thank you Murrieta's for being there. Hope to visit again soon.
Definitely recommended< /review>

The Ortega omelet is delicious. It's like a Chile Rellano. The chips an salsa were fresh. They had a guitarist who was playing beetles songs, mariachi style.</text>

Murrieta's is not taking reservations at this time. First come, first served.
We had exceptional service. I recommend 100% their margaritas! Beware, it's one liter - 4 servings.  So far we've tried the Strawberry and House Margarita.
Food is always delicious! The complementary chips and salsas (green and red) are on point as well.
Perfect spot for a date, easy on the wallet too!< /Review>

<Review>I love this place. My significant other had introduced this place & I sure glad he did. The chicken mole is best! The service is great & FAST!!!! I also love the environment & decor.
***Update***
11-26-18
I have been craving the mole here for over a month. I finally came by & as soon as I walked in with my family I'm greeted & got seated. The easiest was amazing! My son had a blast talking to him about the salsa being too hot for him, so the waiter brought him a kid friendly non spicy salsa. Which was very kind of him & I appreciated it a lot. Everything was delicious 👏
It was so good we didn't take any left over food home ... or tummies were full of all that great food. I hope everyone enjoys themselves here because it is worth it!!< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm8pT8j7-xDUwppzDnOW8eDmO7uzITVjJEexMt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqYOh4AkLePh6cQqngWbIuEp9MKAgtjY1CM0E6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXC_htcz44oATis4GbxQ0lWh8z_vvkb8adwtHC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcFRbdLLmRT_3uaLrukvJW30Tt-HNlarPMeTPe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMna0OMpfrPaZ3E_R0tn6exa40l3AiV-xL-M3Rw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><UserId.>115942064958657745110<//UserId.>< Time>

<review>Delicious food and wonderful decoration, the service is a bit behind in timing that's why I gave it 4 stars,  we did sit for a while before anyone came by. However with that said it seemed as only a few people were working. Very friendly overall! The chilaquiles were tasty a little bit soggy but the flavor stood out great,  the salsas and carrots they provide are very tasty and the coffee is good too! Well be back for sure!<//review>< Rating>

<Text>Calm Mexican-American bar & grill that's decorated with portraits of classic celebrities and cowboy paraphernalia.

This place is great for drinks (not so much for food).

Recommend: the Margarita's ($5) and shrimp burrito ($9).</Text></record>

<Text>Everything about this place is the bees knees. My boyfriend and I feel like we just died and went to heaven. From the moment we walked in, we were immediately welcomed by Enrique, who served us for the night with great vibes. The flavors of the food were unreal. See for yourself, even the margarita pitcher was amazing, and you can mix flavors! I have had my share of quality Mexican food, and this is by far one of the best in San Diego. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and portions. Great place for a date night! We will most certainly be back. (On a weekly basis, if not more often.)</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80d95025865b75d1:0x23d595cbf08b554c</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>The food was amazing as always. The patio outside was well distanced from the few other diners eating. Going in the mid-afternoon was a good decision. No crowds, the marinated carrots and jalapeños were perfect, and the red salsa was as delicious as it has always been. One slight concern was some wait times. With far less business, the restaurant relies on far fewer wait staff. So one server covered maybe half the restaurant, maybe more? This was not a major issue since my daughters, parents, sister, and I were in no rush to do stuff after our visit.
I look forward to going again, and hope Covid can be dealt with in a judicious manner so the restaurant can get back to serving Bonita as it has in the pre-Covid days.< /review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

UPDATE 5/25/2019:

I need to update my review of Murrieta's for one simple reason.  The food is great but service is less then perfect sometimes. On this day my wife and I decided to go to Murrieta's for a late lunch. We were in a hurry because we had some appointments that we had to keep. When we arrived the restaurant was not full as you would expect (it was probably at 20 or 30% capacity). We were promptly seated and served our food that we really enjoyed, but soon after we finished eating our server didn't come back as you would expect. We only wanted our bill to pay and go quickly because of our appointments. We asked another person that was serving drinks and were ignored. After a long time I got up to the front of the restaurant and there was nobody there. It was until I asked the camera guy about paying that he pointed me to a server (Different than our original). while we waited up front  this other server finally gave me my check but it was the wrong one and had to wait a bit longer to get the right one. Finally paid and got out of there and were late for our appointment. I have been here when the restaurant is super busy and delays like this are expected but not when the restaurant is more than half empty. Hope that management reads this and improves on service. Food greatness is not the only thing that makes a restaurant excellent, service is in my opinion the same or more important.

Hopefully Murrietas's can go back to 5 stars after future visits.

OLDER REVIEW:

Last time I was here my son was a baby and now he is 19. My wife and I ordered ceviche and pollo en mole and I can say  both items were very good . More the mole than the ceviche. The place was packed. We will be back sooner<//Review>

So nice to see Murietas'  is surviving covid19. Popped in for an early lunch. Patio seating in this weather was wonderful. For that matter, so was the Barbacoa.....<//Review>

<Text>Great atmosphere and food! This is a great place to have a beer or bring your family to. Service has always been excellent. I suggest trying this place out. The food is authentic Mexican food. It's not your typical sombreros around the corner. The most expensive plate they serve is around 24 dollars. Everything else averages around 12 to 15 dollars. Serving portions are above average. I wasn't able to finish my plate.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Perfect Mexican restaurant. My enchiladas de mole tasted authentic and delicious!!! They made them with cheese instead of chicken to please my vegetarian diet. My frozen strawberry margarita tasted amazing too!!! I could taste real and fresh strawberries. I'll ask them to add more tequila to it next time. The staff is very polite and is bilingual. The decorations of the place are lovely. Everything is colorful. Great selection of authentic Mexican music. The restaurant is very big which helps to avoid feeling like it's too crowded. Huge parking lot.</Review>

This is my 2nd time here and I was very pleased with the food again.  We sat on the patio and there was a man playing guitar softly. It was a very nice date night.  The waiter Betito is great. This is becoming a regular special treat for me and my wife.< /review>

Been coming here for about 12 years...red salsa is so good my wife gets it togo almost every time. I love the green salsa and the picked veggies. If you want to have a good meal you cannot go wrong with the beef fajitas and the carne asada con camarones. My personal favorite is the Barbacoa and my wife absolutely loves the camerones alla diabla....which is suuuuuper spicy . No joke it's very intense and not for the faint of heart< /review>

Felt like the place could of been better if we had a different server, we had Christian and honestly was the worse server I've had in my life, food came out cold, we saw him twice while other servers were circling around him, he was rude and disrespectful</Text>

Hands down some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. The chili Colorado was exactly like my Aunt’s in New Mexico and I’d never thought that was possible. The chamo mango margarita was perfection. I live in Los Angeles and would happily make the 2+ hour drive to eat there again.<//text>

<name>Yanina Herrera< /name><date>1560015953568< /date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>I can't believe this was 14.50! Many Mexican restaurants serve better quality dishes with bigger portions for less. I literally took one bite before taking this picture. That is exactly how much lettuce I was served. There was no love in the making of this dish, only the thought of profit. The enchilada was dry and the sauce thin. I'm used to sour cream, radish and lettuce on top but here you can forget that. You get just a tiny sprinkle of cheese on top. A few scraps of lettuce...a carefully measured scoop of rice and beans and voila! 14.50!! Then a photographer comes around to take pictures and later comes by to charge you for them. Gotta make that money, right? I bought the picture to remember my first and last visit here.

I'd rather go to Casa de Pico where you pay the same or more but I know my food will barely fit on the plate. My dinner can be stretched out into two meals easily. Plus theres mariachis and imho the atmosphere is better.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSm2IpDjZNEYLabkglIEzRbq_W5vGWtCN-s_zq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5xRt0m2RRpbDRG07X4fy7gJ3lLu2NQ-Qa7G4J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80d95025865b75d1:0x23d595cbf08b554c<//gmapID></record>

Everything about it was perfect. Comfortable seating, beautiful decor and authentic Mexican music playing softly. Our waiter Betito was wonderful. I asked what soup I should have and he suggested the abigonas, Mexican meatball soup, and it was so delicious. My boyfriend had the tamales and loved them. I had a chicken enchilada verde also delicious.  We are definitely going back again. Oh. .and the prices are very reasonable.< /text>< pics>

“Welcome to fantasy island!”

The finest Mexican food in Bonita. Inside, there is one half sports bar and one half sit down restaurant. Red leather booths in the bar make for the perfect ambiance. All of the food on the menu is amazing. You cannot go wrong. Chips and salsa(verde y rojo) with carrots are served before you order.< /text>

The menu has lots of options to choose from. The place has a comfortable, neighborhood  feel, perhaps a tad shopworn, but not distractingly so. Full, separate bar with tables where you can order off the dinner menu.</review>< Pictures>

We went looking for a good Mexican breakfast, but we found out that they only serve breakfast on Sunday mornings. The prices are reasonable, they have combo plates were you get to choose from 1 to 3 items and add rice and beans. Their Horchata drink is really good and both of the salsas they give with their chips are very delicious.< /Review>

<Text>Went there for a party that was reserved on the back patio. Very nice shaded area and service was pretty good too. A little slow on refilling the waters (it was 90°+ out, everyone was drinking a lot), other than that, the food was good and most of it came out at the same time. Would definitely recommend if you don't have a party larger than 50 or so< /Text><name>Ian Lewis</name>< response>

< review>
I was taken to Murrieta's Mexican Restaurant by two close friends of mine and I thought that it was one of the best Mexican restaurants that I have eaten at in the whole County of San Diego.
The inside was made up of myriad different types of polished wood with all kinds of Mexican styles of artwork...just really classic. There were the old style leather booths and plants everywhere. The din of the lights and light Spanish music made Murrieta's a great place to relax and enjoy a menu with many orderves and some uniquely Mexican food ; you can get lost in the number of menu choices.
I had a cheese enchilada and a beef enchilada and it was delicious. My two friends had different dishes that are quite popular.
We had lemon and strawberry margaritas-the kind with salt around the lip of the glasses- which were really good.
Their chips were unique because each one was quite thin, instead of the typical thick "tooth crackers." In fact, it would be nice if more restaurants and manufacturers made their chips like Murrieta's. They were also were served with a bowl of thick red sauce ( The chips and bowls of red sauce come with the meals; they also have green sauce).
I suggest that you try this restaurant for yourself if you or you and your friends want some of the best Mexican food in town.
I could say a lot more but, I highly recommend that you seek out this restaurant for yourselves. and you be glad that you did!
It's a great place to relax and get away from this fast paced world and is located near the Bonita area.< /review>

One of my favorite restaurants and Bonita, it's probably the very best restaurant because Bonita has a very very small selection of restaurant...    such a cute little place, sits perched up on a little Hill with the big parking lot
...... a family runs it they always have specials the combination plates are excellent the salsa is excellent they give you plenty of chips.. .. occasionally they will mess up on the order but they're nice enough to fix it right away the seating inside is very cozy , it's like four separate rooms but they're all together the booth seating is the best, the decor is traditional they also have a bar off to the far right as you walk in...... I have eaten here about  25 times and it's worth it.....<//text>

Update: Food is not good anymore. I wonder what happened 🤔
Its sad because I had such a good experience the first time ☹ Definitely not authentic Mexican food. Service is still good though.

Amazing! I absolutely loved this place. I called and they weren't taking reservations but they still put me on the list and even had my table ready when i got there. I went with all my family to celebrate my birthday and they treated us very well. We loved the decorations and atmosphere. They had someone taking and selling pictures, she was very nice and professional, never thought i would bring the memories back home for just $10 (comes with a nice folder frame) The guy playing songs with his guitar knew all the good ones. The service was great and the food was really good, they have so many plates on the menu and with a wide range of prices.
I had a hard time looking for a nice place to have a good meal with my family on my special day and i loved everything about it, definately going back!</text>

The food was great. I got flautas, which I hadn't had before, and they were very soft and tasted great. The beans, rice, chips and guacamole all seemed to be made fresh in house, along with the flour tortillas that came with the heaping steak fajitas. The two musicians were also very skilled, and sounded great, despite me not knowing much Spanish. I will definitely be coming here again.</Review>

The food is okay, though I don't think the menu has changed in decades. Standard Californian-Mexican.

The wait staff is friendly and efficient. The outdoor seating is nice most of the year.

This seems to be the local place people most go to for celebratory meals, and it's great for that.

You might have to wait 20 minutes or so at peak times unless you have a reservation.

A few vegetarian dishes are available.

There's a separate bar on the southern end. Occasionally you might see a horse waiting outside. No spittoons or  grizzled, world-weary sheriffs, though.<//Review>

Been there several times, no matter what time or day of the week you have to wait to be sat.  There is no friendly welcome.  It is almost as if they dont care if you stay or leave.< /Review>< pics>

Their food has always been so delicious, and their chips and salsa are so freaken addicting because of how good the salsa is and the chips are always warm and fresh. I would be terribly sad if they were to ever close because of how great they are. My friend also had her wedding reception here in the outer patio area and it was great. Their food is so bomb.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>The food was outstanding and what really brought this place to a five-star was the fact that the waiter was extremely hospitable and cordial and very nice. The only drawback I have to this place is that it's parking needs a little bit of help although at night you can park next door in the other Shopping Center and you have to walk an extra 30 40 feet or so to get into the restaurant. Flavors are good. Their drinks are strong. 5 stars</text>< username>

This 4 is more like 3 and 1/2, servers are always friendly and hostess knows our names.
Food is consistantly, but not your "homemade" taste. We eat here maybe once a month and the kids love it.
Slash and chips are great, beans are just ok.</Text>

Great service . Waiter was very friendly . prices are not bad . But the atmosphere makes up for it . Big parking lot and large parking spaces. Mexican food was great . We had the enchiladas and tacos for appetizers. Very good and warm . The fruit tea was delicious. My wife and I go there every now and then . Will keep coming back as long as we own property in Chula Vista .</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>The service is spectacular here. The food is amazing and the staff is highly attentive. They are very knowledgeable about their menu and hold an air of patience about them. You will certainly get your money's worth!

The restrooms are also very clean should you ever need to use their facilities while you dine. The restaurant is also very clean and your dirty, cleaned off plates don't stay sitting around for long.

You can also get live music played for you, which is very cool. Overall, the general ambiance of the restaurant is highly relaxing and a great environment  for a family night out, a date or a little treat for yourself if you want to fly solo. 10/5 for sure. Would definitely recommend and visit again.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

This is an honest review from a former restaurant owner. The reason for this being a 4 star review is that in my opinion it is not a 5 star restaurant. There are no James Beard award winning chefs here and they have no nouveau creative inspirations anywhere on the menu. What they DO have is a warm welcoming authentic MEXICAN restaurant. The kind I grew up in, and the kind that should never die. The flavors of all their sauces shows that they take the time to do it right, and they pass my test for a rating a 4/5 star on my scale. That test you may ask? Beans and rice. The beans are great and the rice is ehhh. As any chef of Mexican food will tell you, beans and rice both take a lot of time to get right. However the best Spanish rice requires a lot of attention and beans do their own thing over time. Most restaurant kitchens are far too busy, but if they can still nail the rice and sauces they get a 5 from me. I'll be back.</text>

Wonderful restaurant. We've been going there for over 20 years and love it still. The salsa is fabulous and the service is wonderful. Strangely enough their Fried Chicken is absolutely fabulous. I would definitely recommend it.<//text>

I like Murrietas. The food is good and it is a great local place to go where you will see at least someone you know. The reason it gets 3 stars instead of 4 is that I have had SEVERAL visits where there was a little something extra on the bill.  It's happened with large groups, and happened with a party of 3. It hasn't stopped me from going back, but my friends and I are always careful to check our bills.< /review>

This is a Mexican food restaurant that has been around for 30+ years. The atmosphere is traditional Mexican; the food is excellent; & the service is good. I think it is the best Mexican food place to eat in Bonita. Great prices and large portions of food. The chips are freshly made. Don't eat too many chips & salsa before your meal comes out...you will not have room in your stomach left. Excellent place to take family & friends from out of town that want authentic Mexican food!</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>We come here often. One of the few Mexican restaurants in the area that is really good. I do only eat chicken so I can't vouch for any non-chicken dishes. My favorite is the Enchiladas a la Crema. Great brunch too, I get the Ortega omelet. Great beans and the best green salsa in San Diego. You can order salsa to go.</text><gmapID>0x80d95025865b75d1:0x23d595cbf08b554c<//gmapID>< response>

Restaurant is great, food was good,  service was horrible,  at the beginning waiter was so nice however we were still having our dinner when the waiter started rushing us,  he brought the bill,  we said we were not ready, we said we were talking and that we might have dessert or coffee,  2 minutes later he came back to see if we were ready to order, 1 minute later he came back, we got kind of upset, he was not letting us enjoy our time there.  We ordered dessert,  in the second he brought the dessert he brought the bill again, we ignored the bill and started having our sweets,  he came back and he asked if we could paid the bill because he had to go, nobody else can close our bill? We paid and he left, after that no other waiter came to ask if we needed something.</review>

Great place for a group function. Our SD Academy  High School 40th REUNION was a blast! There was plenty enough room to move around and fashionable heaters to keep us warm. The food was good and the service was friendly.
Thanks Murrieta!</text>

The atmosphere is consistently nice with great wait staff. Sometimes there's even live music.  The food though,  was not consistent. The first two times were great.  Nice crispy fries for the kids, chips salted while warm so it sticks, and no hitches. This last time we brought family visiting and I raved about the place then the queso dip came way too oily, the fries were baked and reheated so the kids wouldn't even eat them, plain chips, and the same corn I have ordered before was now not sweet and clearly dumped straight from a can. Here's the weirdest part: the guacamole has been mixed with peas. It was too obvious that they missed a shipment or something.  Big let down for all of the hype I put into why we Just Had To go there.<//text>

<text>Thought I'd get good Mexican food this close to Mexico, but Albuquerque does tamales better and tacos. Travelled from Virginia. This place puts green peppers and onions in their taco meat and tamales (with chopped pork, not even pulled) like it's some sort of philly italian sausage roll. Overall twice as expensive as it should be.</text></record>

Great Mexican food and fantastic service. Murrieta's has to be one of the best restaurants in South Bay San Diego. The food is authentic and delicious! I like Mexican food and I have enjoyed only a few places like this with an authentic Mexican kitchen, comfortable seating and fantastic service. Thank you Beto and Beto Jr., you guys are excellent servers only adding to the great food. Ask for the very spicy homemade hot sauce. Murrieta's maintains long hours, unlike other restaurants in San Diego, this place stays open late and has a fully stocked bar.< /text>

The tacos were just the way they were 30 years ago.

Unfortunately,  the rest of the place has turned trashy and the service sucks. Half the employees struggle with English. Most of the foods lacks real flavor.  Come for tacos,  chips, salsa, & drinks and you will be happy.<//text>

Delicious food, great service, as always! The green salsa is so addictive, my brother and  I haven't been able to stop having it at least once a week for literally more than 30 years! My kids are also hooked.<//Review>

<review>My friend and I had a meeting last night at Murrietas in Bonita CA. We were in the Happy Hour section. When we decided to order the waiter told us that if we didn’t order an alcoholic drink that we could not order food from the Happy Hour menu. He was loud and disrespectful. So we asked to talk to the manager. He went and spoke to the manager and came back. He related a message that he said he’s going to tell us the same thing. So my response was can you please ask the manager to come speak with us. Eventually Raul the manager came over to our table.  When we asked him why we could not order from the menu without Brian is half a Holick beverage his response was that’s just the way the system is set up it would not allow you to buy food without ordering an alcoholic beverage. We expressed to him that we have been to that restaurant separate with several friends on many occasions and no one has never expressed that to us.  So then we asked where are those rules written that do you have a written on the menu do you have it posted somewhere and he said no those are just the rules. I was very disappointed I feel disrespected because there was another couple in the restaurant that order from the menu that was of a couple of different nationalities and they did not order an alcoholic beverage. So I want to write this review to let everyone know although sometimes you may have great  Service and great food there are still some people that place favoritism and disrespect you. You can never force anyone to buy an alcoholic beverage in order to buy happy hour food from the menu that’s just not written in the clause. I am in the process of emailing the corporate office. And please if anyone has ever experienced this please write a review .</review><response>None</response>< Rate>

Very good service, the hostess doubled as a waitress and visited our table so often I ALMOST felt compelled to exchange numbers with her!   (Very pleasant and friendly.)  ...and most importantly for some, the food was good. Ohh, and my wife reminded me that the chips and salsa were delicious! 😂 🍸< /Review>

My wife and I have been coming here for over 26 years!  As a matter of fact, our first dinner date was right here at Murrietta's!  The food is authentic, the drinks are great, and the hot carrots are the best!  This place has a great family vibe to it but also has an eat-in bar and an outside eating area perfect for group functions.</text>

< Review>
Murrieta's has sufficient parking so there wasnt any issue there. When my boyfriend and I got there no one greeted us until 2min after. Then we were seated away from the group that was having a xmas party so that was appreciated.
Overall service was a bit slow for my taste. We requested flour tortillas and the server brought us corn tortillas THREE times! My boyfriend and I just laughed to ourselves about it, but it would have been nice to have flour tortillas with my Barbados. My bf got the fried chicken and that was yum, too. Food was great, service could do better but it wasn't horrible.<//Review>

I rated this restaurant based on my first visit, it wasn't the best service, the waitress didn't recognize the ingredients on the menu or wasn't listening while we order and on the top of that the time we waited for our food to arrive was very long ( aprox 35 min. )
We went this weekend we got Excellent  Service and no more than 10 min and our food was in our table.
One of the best Barbacoa, after my Mom's.</text>

<Text>I really like this place, murrieta's Mexican food restaurant in Bonita, it's a little bit hidden close to Sunnyside area which would be the east part of Bonita, it's perched up on a hill with a good-sized parking lot, super quaint and cozy atmosphere outside and inside, the service is pretty good, the atmosphere inside for what it is I would definitely give it a high rating of 5, the food is good although many times there are issues with the dishes yesterday I got two chicken enchiladas and the enchilada sauce on top of it was cold but it might have been because we were the first customers of the day..... but my family doesn't really care we still go there anyway because we love the atmosphere and we love the food overall so we go back to this place constantly- I would say about 4 times a month!</Text>< Pics>

Pricey and bland. The place looked nice and the server was nice but a little slow. Went around noon on a Friday and it was dead. The food was garbage though. The food I ordered had absolutely no seasoning on it. The chicken looked and tasted like the pre-cooked Tyson chicken. The carne asada and shrimp looked and tasted almost boiled. I could physically see no seasoning at all. My wife ordered a shrimp enchilada. It was wrapped in a flour tortilla, pretty sure enchiladas are supposed to be corn, and the sauce tasted like Ragu pasta sauce. Bland, horrible, overpriced food. Will not be back. Almost gave 2 stars just for the looks of the place and polite server. Can't do it because of the food though.< /Text>

Good service, good food, sometimes the portions could be a bit bigger, and at times the food is not super hot. Nevertheless, the food is good and the staff is nice!!!! Great atmosphere and a fantastic happy hour. Try the Midori margarita it's one of a kind!< /text>

Authentic mexican food. I love the salsa verse from here, not too spicy, but full of flavor. Ample parking, TVs usually have seasonal sports. Great margaritas so catch a Lyft or Uber so you can indulge. Great for lunch, dinner, large groups or a couple's meal.< /text>

This place is perfect for larger groups. If you like Mexican food and want to hang out with a lot of your friends this is the place.  They have plenty of free parking and plenty of tables.  The food is okay, I say just okay because I like my Mexixan food spicy.<//review>

Our new local Mexican restaurant. Don't know why I've been driving by for so many years. Ordered arroz con pollo,which  was very tasty.the chicken and sauce had such a delicious taste. Definitely coming back.
Simply one of the best in Bonita.< /Review>

I would give them 0 starts but it would not allow me. We were in the patio and asked for heaters    because it was cold. The waiter made an excuse stating the heaters were out of gas. Then another big group came in and all of a sudden had the heaters turned on for them. Staff is slow, staff is rude an inconsiderate. Won't come back!!!<//text>

<text>I wish their food was more "Mexican", as it's in the name, flavor-wise, I ordered enchiladas and Chile rellenos and was disappointed. Flavors were so bland. The Chile was skimpy. Rice was sad.

The interior was well decorated. Price is fair. "Ay caramba..."<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It's been years since eating here and I remember when it was good. Came from out of town and wasn't impressed. Seems like the quality went downhill.< /review>

<text>My family has eaten there for years, but last night was the worst. We usually get the Chile rellenos and they have been good, but 3 of us ordered that last night and all 3 of us got slightly warm plates, the cheese inside the Chile's was cold and hard, not melted and the Chile's were tough and under cooked. This was after waiting for our food for over half an hour. We told the waiter and took our plates back to the kitchen. He returned and told us "that's the way they are" and offered us to order something different. The manager never came and talked to us and we were never comped for the appetizers we ate. Needless to say we will never go back. We then went to Casa Don and had a delicious meal. Don't waste your money at Murriettas!<//text>< Pictures>

The food used to be good.  The Burrito Ranchero was flavorless, just boiled beef in a  mushy flour tortilla.  Flavorless shrimp in my friend's salad.  The service is great, but the food needs help.<//Review>

They always get my order incorrect. The last time I ordered cheese enchiladas with green sauce and it came back red. They brought it back then I looked underneath it and the red sauce was still on it. Not OK!!!  I do not recommend this place to anyone.</Review>

< review>
My wife and I went here today to celebrate Father's day and our wedding anniversary. We have been here before. My wife loves it. I think it just ok. Today changed that ok to not good. I ordered the brunch special Ortega omelette. The waiter came out telling us to watch out, that the plate was very very hot. Well, the plate was hot, but the omelet was cold. I not saying a little cold, but like it was in the refrigerator and reheated. All the inside ingredients were very cold. Horrible!!!! I believe these are premade and reheated. There is no way it was cooked to order and served. I'm very dissapionted with that experience only because my wife loves it there. So be warned people. Good luck.</review>

Murrieta's is a good place for authentic Mexican food. There is a great bar area for both food and drinks and then the dining area with sports on big TV's and occasional live music.</Text>

This is the place that the restaurants in Old Town try to be. Plenty of room for parties of all size. Authentic. Bar is separate from the restaurant.< /review>

Good food if a bit out of the way. I prefer El Patio across town, but this place is legit if you are up for a change of pace or if you're on the East side of the 805.<//review>

Murrieta's is an amazing Restaurant with great food, lively atmosphere, and outstanding staff. Sure it can be loud, but the food is SO worth it, authentic cuisine and fast service. You wont regret coming here.< /text>

<Text>Went in to an empty lobby. Sat ourselves to a busy bar full of employees. Nobody seemed to care that we were unattended for 20 minutes. Older gentleman with glasses behind the bar very loudly commented in spanish to his smiling non stop co worker, "mala cocina y mal servicio". Pretty glad I left.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>So for Father's Day my daughter wanted to take me out for dinner.  Knowing that our regular place to eat out was packed as always, we decided to go to Murrieta's Mexican Restaurant for the dinner. I haven't been here in a long while, but, as I remembered 5 years ago, the food was really good and everyone had enjoyed their meal. Now it's 2016 and the restaurant area and the cantina area were also filled with regulars, watching the game or just having a relaxing time together. As for our service, the young waiter had 5 tables that he was trying his best to serve. But with all the big tables of people he was serving, it caused him to get overloaded and caused many tables to get their food, a few minutes longer then if he only had only 3 big tables. But getting back to the food, it was as good as I remembered it. I had the Albondigas soup, which was very good. Only complaint on that is, you get 2 meatballs in your bowl and the charge is 10 dollars! So it's pretty pricey then it used to be. I also had their Chile Colorado, again also very good in taste and filling. Only complaint is, 15 dollars for that dish. So if the service matched the priceyness of the plates and soups, then yeah I can see paying top dollar for top service, but the restaurant really needs more waiters or waitresses working that big table area, in order to get those orders out in a timely manner. Other then that, we were filled up and glad the dinners were very good.<//Review>< Pictures>

One of the best Mexican restaurants in San Diego. It's a little pricey and upscale, but it's a nice place and well worth it. Best chips salsa and carrots in town hands down. Great chile verde, flautas, barbacoa, and vegetarian options too. Ask for the Diablo sauce if you like spicy, it comes free with the rest of the chips/salsa.</Text>

<text>Very disappointed. Been to this place 3 times. First time my friend took me the service was bad, but the food was okay. So, I decided to introduce my husband to this place since it was really close to our house. My husband is very picky and is one of those that doesn't really like to try something different.Well, we went one day, he ordered tacos de papas and it came with a small bowl of bean soup. Surprisingly he really liked it! That was the second time I've been to this place. The third time, he was really  looking forward to have tacos de papas and the bean soup again. It really was his favorite. We went and he ordered his favorite. The food came, my husband had a few spoons of the bean soup and took a bite of one of the tacos and he looked at the other taco and saw a hair on the taco. Told the waiter. The waiter didn't even apologize. He just said that he will bring a new plate. Husband was very patient. New plate came, the tacos were different and the  bean soup looked different. Told the waiter and the waiter asked my husband if he would like to order something else. I insisted that that was my husband's favorite. The waiter still didn't apologize to us and didn't make an effort to get my husband his favorite food. So, I ended up sharing what I ordered with my husband. I was really upset and I felt bad that my husband was really looking forward to having some tacos de papas and bean soup and he didn't get it. He was really excited to go back to this place. I finally got my husband to like something different and it ended up being a fail. Husband says to me, "We are not coming back to this place". Sorry to say, but the waiter did not deserve a tip.< /text>< name>

I love this place. Enrique is my favorite waitor. I eat here almost once a week for the past 2 years. They have really great food. One of my faves is the  enchiladas in mole sauce. I totally love it. The cadillac margaritas birthday style is good, too. I know mexican food. I work in Otay Mesa and get authentic Mexican food most of the time, Murrietas really knows how to serve it up. This is a really great place. The staff is wonderful, too. I am always satisfied here. Signed, Minerva from Express Auto Auction.< /Review>

<text>The food there was terrible I had a stomach ache all night and my nephew actually got sick when we called tto complain they were really rude and said they would have the manager call us back and no one ever did . I was so disappointed because I have been going there for years and it was one of my late Mother's favorite places to go when we were growing up but I'll never go there again I wouldn't recommend it to anyone< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80d95025865b75d1:0x23d595cbf08b554c</gmapID></record>
