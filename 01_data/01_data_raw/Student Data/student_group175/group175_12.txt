<review>I've used H2H movers for both of my moves (Suburbs > Chicago, Chicago > Chicago) and I was very satisfied from the service! The staff is quick moving, careful, and willing to go the extra steps to make sure everything is how you'd like it. I recommend H2H to all my friends here in Chicago!< /review><time>1628022697848</time>< Rating>

Fabulous experience with this wonderful company! They were super professional with booking our move and the movers who helped us were so kind, thoughtful, and accommodating with some tricky items. They were lightening fast, efficient, and safe. Would absolutely working with this great company again in the future!<//text>

Unfortunately, after what I thought was a perfectly awesome move - A few weeks later while unpacking I discovered a check out of my checkbook was missing and was forged for $1700. I used my checkbook the day before my packing day, put it back in drawer. Packers were the only ones with access to that drawer. Yes, I should of packed those important things my self. Lesson learned. This company was professional, priced good, hard working and kind. Unfortunately, one of their packers was a thief.<//Text>

Extremely professional and effective service. Our movers did an excellent job at helping us move and they made it a wonderful and pleasurable experience. They wrapped all sensitive items, transported everything with utmost care, assembled furniture, and they went above and beyond with every task performed. We HIGHLY recommend H2H to anyone planning on moving. You will get more than your moneys worth!< /Review>

<Review>Moving can be very stressful and frustrating but not with this company....
I have moved multiple different times state to state or just locally and I haven’t had the best experience with movers.  Not only was this company the best company I’ve ever used but the most efficient, professional and respectful not only for myself but for my time and property.
Not one thing was damaged and every box was placed in the correct location that it was labeled for.
I will 100% Recommend this company to anyone!</Review>< Resp>

<Review>H2H is amazing! This is our second time within 3 weeks utilizing their services and we have continued to be pleased. The Hugh-quality service began just setting up the appointment and receiving a quote. Both times I was able to get movers scheduled for a next day move. Though this may not be typical, they work hard to ensure you’re taken care of!

The 3-men crew that was sent to us (same crew both times), were professional, arrived early with plenty of notice, and were quick with getting the job done. All our pieces were handled with extreme care. Since we had both our moves during COVID-19, it was nerve-wracking, but the H2H team ensured our safety and theirs. I would highly recommend! Thanks H2H!< /Review>< Time>

My last moving experience with another company was not so great, so I was skeptical when choosing a new mover. This experience with H2H was extremely pleasant. From the start they gave me an hourly rate discount for a cash payment, which on my limited budget help immensely.

The communication was superb with H2H, they called me the evening before to confirm I was still on track, I received a text message in the morning with an ETA, and the guys called me a few minutes before their arrival.

The two gentlemen that came out to do the move were very professional, polite, and clean. They listened and accommodated all my needs and addressed my concerns. Being hourly, I made the incorrect assumption they would drag their feet a little to bring up the hours work, boy was I wrong, they moved swiftly and kept assuring me that the move would be quick.

I plan on moving again in the next few months and you can rest assured that I will be calling H2H for that move as well. Thanks H2H!</Text>

Very happy with the service. The workers were friendly and efficient. They explained billing when they first arrived and then were quickly to work. They were extremely considerate of our new home, and hand-carried items upstairs to save the floors and walls from their dollie. I would definitely recommend.</review>

I'm not saying this from a place of anger or to drive away business, I felt obligated to write this review after how me and my family were treated by these people. The basics: they showed up late, refused to move us (based on a lie, I'll explain), before insulting my family and my house, and then finally REFUSING TO REFUND OUR DEPOSIT!!!!!!!! These guys showed up, REFUSED TO DO THEIR JOB, left, and then KEPT OUR MONEY ANYWAYS!!!! The reason for refusing to do their job, I'm not even joking, is because our house wasn't clean enough. As if we weren't in the middle of MOVING. They explained that they had told us over the phone that if sanitation was an issue that this could happen, which is the LIE. Not once was that mentioned, NOT ONCE. We then called the manager, who REFUSED TO GIVE US OUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!!! If these guys had just not done their job, I probably wouldn't have written this. But the fact that they refused to do their jobs, WHILE insulting me, my family and my home before basically stealing our money, is why I felt obligated to let everyone know about this. Please, if you are looking for a moving service, pick LITERALLY anyone but H2H.
Follow up: H2H KNOWS THEY WERE WRONG because 2 days later they called us to refund our money...but only IF WE TOOK DOWN THIS REVIEW. You read that right, they still (STILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) REFUSED TO DO THE RIGHT THING and give us back the money THEY STOLE FROM US unless there was something in it for them. SO....on top of all the other ways my family was mistreated by this company, you can also now add BRIBERY to this list. This is now beyond just a moving company, THIS IS THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS OF ANY KIND I HAVE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF DEALING WITH. AGAIN, to any other people (family's especially) thinking about using H2H, PLEASE USE ANYONE ELSE!!!!!. This place has PROVEN ITSELF to be nothing more than a fraudulent con job.<//Text>< pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1615485325772, 'text': "Dear Tyler,\n\nI am really sorry we did not perform the services as promised and you did not become the raving fan of us as many people are. Movers do get paid based on hourly rate and every cancelation costs them loss of income. We do not cancel jobs for no reason and unfortunately, we did cannot force them to work in conditions they don't find safe. That is one of the reasons why we call two days before the move and go over the policies to make sure situations like this do not happen. And the reason why the money were kept is because we use the money to compensate mover’s loss of income and for the time spent coming out to you.\n\nDespite our warnings and policies, we did offer you a compensation to make up for the inconvenience our company caused. Unfortunately, the person we spoke to was not willing to accept it.\n\nIf you are interested in resolving this issue to your satisfaction, please reach out to me at Lyuda@H2hmovers.com\n\nOtherwise, we wish you nothing but the best at your new home!\n\nSincerely,\n\nLyuda K"}<//Response></record>

I have moved multiple times in my life and can confidently affirm that H2H Movers are the BEST I have ever hired. From the initial call to the completion of the move, EVERYTHING was perfect.
The move took longer than anticipated but was totally worth it. Alex and his team were careful when wrapping and moving all my furniture and items.
Going the extra mile??? H2H has the best movers. After we completed the move, Alex came back with one of his team members to transport a big mirror that we had forgotten at my old place.
So happy and amazed with the work Alex and his team did! Thank you H2H Movers!!!!< /text>

Had a really pleasant experience hiring movers for the first time. Jessica followed up multiple times to ensure I had the best price for my service, even the day of the move. The 3 movers I hired were on time, respectful, and very efficient. I wish I had hired them sooner! My only concern is I was told about covid-19 precautions where the movers would wear masks and gloves, none of them did. I'd recommend confirming and making sure they do.< /text>

The team of three packed a truck for me.  They showed up on time, were very courteous, worked fast, and did an amazing job stuffing the 15 foot truck with my belongings, using every bit of available space.  Thanks!,<//text>

<text>I just relocated my entire family from Chicago to LA and we used H2H Movers. And they were fantastic on helping us move basically from coast to coast.  It's amazing that they have two locations in big cities.  They made the whole process extremely pleasant for us.  Lyuda, the owner was wonderful on communicating with us and her movers were quick and handled all of our stuff with greatness.  Thank you H2H movers.<//text><user_id>113942416505998308011</user_id><gmapID>0x80e8258a2f96f439:0xd480bf3a84dc36ef<//gmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures><Date>1585710114176</Date><rating>5</rating>< username>

<user_name>Lily Anita</user_name><review>Was moved yesterday me and my husband where very pleased with the aftermath of our moving. For the first time our move was not stressful and having two kids they made packing and organizing so much easier for us. They made sure everything was how we wanted it to be taken and no damage was done to any furniture which was my top concern. The workers where polite and didn’t rush. Would recommend for family and friends<//review>< gmap_id>

I had a great experience with h2h movers they provided packing totes which was very helpful because I didn’t have boxes to pack in. My move was organized and stress free. Dima and Emil showed up exactly at 8am as it was promised. They did a great job wrapping my furniture up and had all the tools that they needed to take apart my bed. Would recommend if you are looking for good service! Thank you, I will definitely use you guys again.<//review>

Even though we do everything possible to move items safely, sometimes damages do happen. You personally told the movers not to worry and that you have a warranty on a lamp. Later, after you requested to be compensated for a full amount, we personally called the manufacturing company who said you do have a warranty and all you have to do is call and file a claim for a free replacement.\n\nLegally, movers' maximum liability is 60 cents per lbs per article and even though we know your lamp can be replaced, you are still entitled to the reimbursement. Based on the weight, it came out to $9.\n\nPlease kindly call the same number we provided you with to file a claim and get the item replacement.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLyuda"}<//response><GmapID>0x80e8258a2f96f439:0xd480bf3a84dc36ef</GmapID></record>

I just completed my move with H2H Movers and I can't say enough words to describe the service I received. They are a new company, and because of that, I was promised they would work twice as hard. Let me tell you, every promise was delivered. They arrived on time, with all supplies, moved me quicker then anyone else I've tried before. People say moving is not easy, but it can be with H2H Movers. If you do hire them, ask for Alex and Emil - the boys are fantastic!< /Text>

They had to deal with moving everything out of a 4th floor walk up and I didn't hear one word of complaint. They even went above and beyond to help me pack some stuff up in my car. They wrapped and protected my more fragile/important furniture, and were speedy while also being super careful.

Professional, friendly and very knowledgeable. Our Range Rover runs just like  new, I had no idea how bad it ran until we drove it after they worked on it. Highly recommend European Autowerks.</Review>

This was the first time that i used these guys for my 2009 mini cooper clubman.  I felt like I was dealing with family (in a good way).  They are so very responsive and keep you informed on what is happening.  And they are really personable people, someone I can trust fully.< /Text>

Brought my car in for A/C service. Got my car back with the gas door broken and check engine light on.  They  took  no responsibility for the damage. Told ne they could look into repairing  the problems (at my cost) in three weeks. My car is now undrivable. This place is trash. Don't go there or you will get scammed.</text>

< review>
On May 13, 2021 we brought our 2008 Jaguar Vanden Plas to European-AutoWerks for the reason of correcting the CATS system fault. They had the car for three weeks, returning it to us with more problems than it had when we left it with them.

They replaced a connector to one of the struts, causing the CATS system fault code to go away. Their inspection of the rest of the car revealed a “severely” leaking rack and pinion. This was approved by us for replacing. These two repairs cost us over $2200.

As mentioned above, they had the car for three weeks. Every day I would call and ask for an update, to which they would replay, “tomorrow or the next day, at the latest.” I would call again the next day , requesting an update, to which they would replay, “tomorrow or the next day, at the latest.” This went on for three weeks.

On June 2, 2021, while on our way to European-AutoWerks to pick up our car, we were called by them and  informed that the air conditioning motor had failed and needed to be replaced. Their recommendation regarding the replacement of the motor was based on, as they stated, the motor getting electrical current and not turning. We declined. Upon entering the car we found that the driver side seat would not move. They checked for codes and none were found. I suggested that it was a fuse. This notion was countered by them stating that it would have showed up on the code reader. Later that afternoon, I examined the fuses, find one that was burnt. After replacing that fuse both the air conditioning motor and the seat started working. It seems very strange that the motor would receive electrical current with a burnt fuse in the circuit.

During our drive home, the CATS system fault warning, the original problem, came on again. The next day the power steering began to malfunction. This time we decided to take the car to Hoehn Jaguar Land Rover in Carlsbad, not being able to be without our car for another three weeks. They found that while replacing the connector on the strut European-AutoWerks incorrectly routed the wires over the exhaust, causing the wires to burn. They also found that while replacing the rack and pinion they incorrectly routed those wires, causing them to burn as well. Hoehn was able to correct both in two days.

When I contacted them regarding these issues, seeking restitution, they politely replied that they had nothing to do with these problems, except the power steering failure, which they ignored completely. When I emailed them back regarding the power steering, they refused to respond.

You might ask why we didn’t return to European-AutoWerks so that they could repair their mistakes. Well, first, they denied having anything to do with the problems with which they sent us home. Second, they had the car for three weeks, returning it to us with more problems than it had when we left it with them. Who in their right mind would return to them after that? We could not afford any more damage to our car.

The burnt fuse in a circuit getting electricity was very suspicious. I just hope the rack and pinion actually needed replacing.

We do not recommend European-AutoWerks in Temecula.</review>

I had three of my Audi’s ( a4, a8 and q5 ) done there with no problems.  Today I called because my car broke down out of town and audi in Palm Springs said my timing chain was stretched and needed to be replaced. I got it towed back home so I can take it to European Autowerks. I called and the guy over the phone said it must be misdiagnosed and it’s a uncommon request. (Lol , ut the did the timing chain on my a4. ) He said trust them and pay. They will be in the hook for it and hung up.
Well sure I already got it towed and I am sure audi did not misdiagnose it. We had them change the spark plugs and spark coils already..

I will not be using your services and will now take all my audi’s elsewhere.<//Review>

I told you that a stretched chain will not make a car die, it will set a check engine light long, long , long before the vehicle dies.. So I didn't trust their diagnosis, but if you trust their diagnosis, then trust their price and when it doesn't fit your problem, make them repair it for free.  That is what I said.........."}<//Resp>

Outstanding customer service I have a Mercedes SL63 AMG. I am new to the area did my research and European Autowerks came up called to make an appointment they were booked for the week. However, if I took my car in they would try to fit me in. I dropped my car off, the following day they were ready to work on my car. The entire staff were very polite and professional. I was very pleased with the work and the labor was within a fair price they even had my car washed. I will definitely take my car back for future service. You have gained a loyal customer. Keep up the great work and service 👍</Text>

I am fairly new to Temecula, I am a transplant from Orange County,  I had to find a local auto service because I did not want to drive to Orange County. After researching many auto reviews, I decided on European Autowerks. Results,  I am very happy to of found European Autowerks their prices were fair and they were professional, heck I even received a complimentary car wash!   They have my recommendation.</review>

I had discovered the screws were missing on the right side of my hood latch, this could have been very dangerous while driving. I called EA and they immediately ordered the part/screws and installed it the next day. The Best service ever and at NO CHARGE. What a wonderful surprise 👏.

This was an amazing experience. I love my vehicle. It's a Diesel BMW, X5. Check Engine lights/sensors are scary and can be costly. Scott, Baroni and the dedicated staff walked me through each diagnosis, were cognizant of my budget and my time.

I am very happy with their quality and service. This is my new home for my BMW and all of the work going forward.

Thank you European Autowerks.</review>

<text>I selected this shop because of the great reviews and not wanting to trust my car with just anyone but I am highly disappointed.

Technicians were friendly which was nice but I prefer quality service above above anything else.

I brought my car in for an oil change. They claimed with the oil change they also top off all fluids. 3 weeks after my oil change, my car alerted me that coolant level was low. I called in to inquire if they had indeed topped off fluids and they said they had and perhaps it was the heatwave that made my coolant level drop. Hmm...ok. But 2 weeks after that, I got a notification that the oil level was low. I have never had these problems before. I’m not sure what was done when my car was left their for servicing but I cannot ever return.<//text>< userid>

<Review>Had an appt. on Friday at 8:15am for an oil change. I Called them at 1pm and they hadn’t even started. Why make an appt? Got a call at 4:10, 50 minutes before they are closing for the weekend, and they emailed me their “inspection”. They had the car all weekend because it was too late for me to get there before closing.

I called at 11am on Monday to say I was coming to pick it up. I was told my car now won’t start. This was not in their “inspection” email from Friday. So a new problem??? I got a call at 4pm saying my tank was empty and my gauge was wrong and that’s why it wouldn’t start. I had filled my tank before I dropped it off on Friday, so their reasoning was flawed and unfounded, as they only needed to call and ask me if the tank was full - like the gauge says. So I pick up my F150 truck from them and it now has issues starting. My car is in worse shape than when I dropped it off.

This place is absolutely terrible. Will NEVER come back.</Review><time>1610492575292< /time></record>

My Range Rover computer system was causing unusual activity throughout the suv. I wasn’t comfortable driving an hour and a half to a Land Rover dealer. EA fixed the problem. They were professional, knowledgeable and understanding. They provided great service a great value. I was completely satisfied so I took my Porsche Turbo S and my Ford 450 for a/c repair and other services. I highly recommend European Autowerks and Quality 1.<//text>

First time using this place.  It feels different from the moment you walk in and as the experience continues you realize that they are not your typical automotive service shop all the way until you get your car back.

< Review>
I am so glad I found this place to work on my Land Rover. They were honest, professional and forthcoming with the information on the work and info for my vehicle. They didn’t price gouge and kept me informed every step of the process to fix a bunch of damage I had from mice and even told me how to prevent future damage.
I’ve been in Temecula about 2.5 years now and it is such a relief to have found a company I trust to bring my car to. My husband and I are very happy and would recommend this place to anyone who needs an honest and quality mechanic in the area. Thanks so much!<//Review>

BMW 435iGrand Coupe
So this is the second time I've brought my vehicle here. I will say that they are some of the most professional individuals I have met. The price you pay compliments their work! If you have a European vehicle...look no further. These cars are complex and need well complex attention. As long as I live here....this is the only place I'll take my car. Considering my BMW is off its warranty... You can only imagine what the dealership would charge for even small issues. These guys are more reasonable than the dealership and I can attest to the caliber of work they perform. They truly know the vehicles they work on. Nobody buys an expensive car to neglect it. Treat your investment right and take it to these guys for all your servicing needs!< /Text>

Brought my Range Rover Sport in 7 months ago for diagnostic with suspension fault light coming on. The owner Scott is nice to talk to but their Range Rover "specialist" tech is a joke. They kept my car in the shop for 2 days, charged me $120 diagnostic test and all they gave me was a printout from the computer saying here are a list of what's wrong with the car and suggested I bring my car in to the dealer because they can't fix it.
I was going to bring it to the dealer but figured it will cost more time and money so I went on those online range rover forums and got more helps than their range rover tech. I bought a new solenoid valve for my range rover air pump on Ebay for $40. I installed it myself in an hour and fixed the fault issue myself. Been running good ever since. I wanted to wait this long to make sure I really fixed the issue. Save your money and time and bring your Range Rover elsewhere. If they claimed to be a Range Rover specialist and can't fix the issue after 2 days in the shop...and I was able to fix it with some online browsing and an hour working on the car. Lets keep in mind that I have very little experience working with cars. I think that said enough about their expertise.< /Text>

I have used European Autowerks for my Audi and Chevy. In my initial experience, I went out and got quotes from the dealership and low end shops. These guys were closer aligned to the low end of the quotes I received. So, you can't do better on price. They determine the scope of work and share their recommendation clearly with pictures before they do the work. Most importantly, they fix your issue. I've never had to follow up on work they have done for me. I would recommend these guys for any type of work you need to have done.<//review>

My Jaguar xf overheated coming up to play golf from San Diego,  the only real Jaguar specific option for miles was European Autowerks, aka, Quality 1.  After contacting Baroni, he and the crew assured me they could help.  They took the car in, helped with a rental and had my car back to me the next day.  Scott the owner followed up personally, which I appreciated.  The car is running great, and I would recommend them for your Jaguar service needs.< /text>

My car had an issue with the cruise control. I scanned the computer in the car a found it had error codes saying it was a sensor for the parking. I asked if they had the proper equipment to calibrate the sensors because I was told only Audi could do it. They said it was necessary to diagnose the problem first. That made sense. I left it with them and two hours later received  a call saying they weren't sure why they also got the error code for parking sensor. They said it could be a pinched wire or loose one. They wanted to remove the front bumper to find out. I again asked if they had the equipment to calibrate the sensors. He did not know if they did, but if needed they would send it to the Audi dealership. They wanted to charge me 665 dollars to remove the bumper. I asked them to get the car ready for me to pickup. I arrived and car was not ready but my bill for 118 dollars was. I asked what he had done and I honestly don't remember what he said. I then took my car car to Audi and they charged me 99 dollars for the same thing I just had done. I told the service person at Audi that they wanted to take my bumper off to see how to fix my issue. He told me if they took the bumper off it would cost me 999 dollars to calibrate sensors.Wow. Long story short Audi found the problem and they "DID NOT" have to remove bumper to fix it. Lesson learned...Don’t use these guys ever..< /review>

As of right now, I am completely dissatisfied and I feel completely taken advantage of. On Saturday I sent a request from their website to schedule a diagnosis and got back an acceptance email for an appointment.. No one called me to confirm my appt or inform me of pricing so I assumed I was going in for a free quote without an appointment. I called Monday to see if I could get in sooner which wasn't possible, still no one mentioned pricing, I asked for a quote again and they said they didn't want to "waste my time, or their time" by getting me a quote for something they werent sure it needed, so I waited for my appt. Went in to my appt, checked in, gave them my key, and then I finally thought I should ask the price for the diagnosis to which he replied $118 and that cost DOESNT go towards service! I had already waited the entire week for this appt and said whatever Ill pay it, but now I just feel like I got played. Also theyre telling me it needs new wheels, new tires, new bearing, new brakes, AND an alignment (2 other places only mentioned the 1 bearing); all prices were higher than the Audi dealership and Meinekee, I asked if they could honor their quote if I did the work here instead of there and they said no. Asked to get a call from the manager and havent heard from him so I'm going to assume I'm just out $120 and that my car still wont be fixed any time soon. Im extremely disappointed and they just added to my stress from dealing with other car shops.

EDIT: How about you call me, because most of what you're saying is not correct or missing information.</text>

Great experience at this shop. We took our car in for an a/c related issue and diagnosed same day. Also compared pricing on new motor mounts in comparison to dealer and European Autowerks was 1/2 the cost of the dealer. I started pricing other services as well with Scott and was pleasantly surprised. We will be bringing our car here from now on.<//text>

< Review>
Honest and very reasonable for services compared to the dealership.  I came here coz the Audi dealer wanted to charge me over 700$ to replace a battery in my Q7 and they did it for $430. Everyone is friendly and no scare tactics or pushy service people trying to get you to do more than what is required which is what the experience at the dealership was.
If you are looking for a reliable and reasonable Audi mechanic this is the place to come to.< /Review>

<text>My Porsche wouldn't start one morning, and being new to the area I didn't  know where to go.
Did the search on google, European Autowerks came up so thought I would give them a try - glad I did.
Had the care towed there, they called when it arrived - nice of them. Only took them an hour or so to diagnose it to the fuel filter. They promptly replaced it and my car was up and running again. Very nice service and quick.

Jason is a great guy to talk to, and will be going back.</text>< Rate>

Highly recommend European Autowerks!! Scott and his team provide outstanding customer service in addition to quality repairs. I do basic maintenance on all our vehicles, but trust EA for those repairs that YouTube can't help with ;) Their work is always done on time and at less expense than other shops in the area. A+ all the way!<//Text>

I highly recommend European. They are extremely knowledgeable, honest, and positive! I was able to immediately speak to Jason on my first call. In a very welcoming and friendly way, he made an appointment for my 2013 Mini Countryman for the very next morning and , because I called late in the day, he also explained drop-off procedures for that evening.  When I arrived, I was impressed by how clean the front office and waiting room were. After I explained the services my car needed and handed over my keys, Robert gave me a shuttle ride to the nearby mall, where I shopped and watched a movie until my husband could pick me up after work. The very next day, Jason called me and clearly explained what work the team suggested For my car and how much it would cost. Later, I picked up my Mini and found that they had not only serviced it, but washed it as well! Thanks European Autowerks for your excellent professionalism, expertise, and customer service! You're the only ones with which I trust with my beloved Mini!< /Review>

I highly recommend European Artwerks in Temecula Valley. From the start I was greeted with Professionalism. The shuttle bk home while they worked on my vehicle was highly appreciated and Andrew the driver was very friendly. Berani was courteous and has awesome communications skills. John thr technician went above and beyond to solve my problem and money. I appreciate the great service especially during these times of uncertainty!!!
Great job guys... will be bk for more business if needed.< /Review>

I was very nervous. I bought a used Mercedes 2007 C230 sport sedan and my apprehension was then the unknown of what repairs were going to cost, maintenance of the car.
Summer is upon us it's going to eventually start to get blistering hot out here in Wildomar California and the airconditioner was what brought me here.  The airconditioner working great!  I also had the oil changed and the transmission serviced. So far so good.
Thank you European Autowerks</text>

Outstanding service as always!  This shop is as honest as they get, which is rare for an auto service provider.  These guys go as far as sending you digital pictures of what they're seeing to help you make your own decision about the work you want done. Case in point, took my vehicle to a dealer which said I needed new brakes. Got a second opinion at a Midas, which said brakes weren't as bad as the dealer said, but should be replaced really soon. Brought it to these guys, and they sent me pictures of my brakes that showed I had 9mm out of 12mm remaining in my brake pads...what the heck!!! Needless to say, the good people at Quality 1 earn your business with their honesty and professionalism, not by taking you for a drive. I will miss you guys now that I'm moving out of state. Oh yeah, they set me up so I can find another good mechanic at my new location. Simply great! Keep up the superb work.<//text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>I trusted European Autowerks but soon they tried to take advantage of my trust. They informed me that my turbo charger is defective and the whole engine has to be taken out to repair the turbo charger. The cost was that job in multiple of thousands. They had installed a sensor that did not belong to my model hence check engine light. Upon installing the old sensor from the old replaced part the check engine light went away and the car is running beautifully. They also cracked my windshield while car was in their shop. I asked them to go over the security camera surveillance but they never did.
Bottom line stay away from these guys.<//text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Best experience ever with a car repair shop! From the very start, I was treated like my business was treasured and that they wanted to earn my business for the long haul--not just a one-time event. Prompt, courteous, friendly, knowledgeable--everything I wanted and needed for my newish car. They answered all my questions (which were many!) with patience and thoroughness. When there was a delay in obtaining a part, I was kept apprised of the timing for that to be resolved. Superb customer care and service!<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Good auto service isn't cheap and neither is my time: so when I'm given a quote and a time frame for service, I expect the shop to deliver.  European Autowerx delivered for my 2017 Audi Q7 that had a PCV valve failure that made a loud whistling noise. The job was done within 3 work days, including ordering parts, and was billed at the quoted cost.  No surprise costs or add on work.  My car's problem was originally misdiagnosed by a franchise auto shop as a bad alternator bearing, but Europen Autowerx quickly honed in on the PCV valve failure even though there was no CEL or OSB-II code yet. Nice job guys! Thanks, Keith</text>< username>

I called Monday morning and took my BMW in the same day to check a engine light that was coming on periodically. Of course the light never came back on while they were testing it but they were honest in their findings and didn't try to talk me in to replacing a bunch of parts. I took the car home on Tuesday and will definitely take it back if it comes on again. Thanks for the great service.<//text>

We were ready to sell our Subaru because we couldn't find a garage with qualified mechanics to work on it. Then we found European Autowerks. My car runs as smooth as it did brand new in 2006.

<text>They give a very thorough diagnosis along with a detailed email with photos of suggested repairs. I have had two cars there several times, and their repair cost and time quotes are accurate. Spending $$ on your European auto is never pleasant, but these guys at least give you peace of mind and a solid warranty.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1490143746302, 'text': 'Thank you, Michael for the Great review...

These guys are the best! I have taken my Jetta in here for little things in the past but recently I had to bring it in for an ignition issue. The parts had to be special ordered with at least a week wait time. They referred me to a rental car company and kept me posted on the progress. My car was ready earlier than I expected!! They have always been kind and accommodating. I would recommend them to anyone. Thank you for your kindness and professionalism. You guys are the best!!< /review>

I've been using European Auto Works of Temecula for my vehicles maintenance for several years.  They use the actual dealer recommended parts, do a great job and the cost is less than if I took it to the dealer.  Plus I love the personal touches. They are trust worthy and friendly.  If your looking for excellent auto repair or maintenance dealer quality at a reasonable price please check them out.< /text>

<review>This was my first time going through this business for an oil change on my Land Rover. Everyone was really kind over the phone and in person. There was a shuttle available to take me home which was really convenient. Much easier to go here instead of the dealership. I would defintely go back to European Autowerks to get more services done on my vehicle.</review>< Pictures>

The team at European Autowerks were great. I had an intermittent engine light in my new to me Mercedes R320 Bluetec. Since I have a family trip to Oregon planned and no time of my own I brought it in. The team worked hard to find the problem. They actually performed systematic troubleshooting, not just replace and hope. I also asked them to do a basic inspection and see if there was anything else wrong. Since it is a used car with 80,000 miles on it, they found issues. Mostly due to an apparent lack of maintenance by the previous owner. While this maintenance was not cheap, because Mercedes Benz just aren't cheap to own, the team was honest and willing to work with me. For each issue they said they had the old parts or failing fluid to show me the issue. Nothing was hidden. When I picked up the car not only did it run better, the codes were cleared and filed at the shop, and the car was washed. At every step the shop made me feel like they were working for me. I don't mind paying more for great service and great work. European Autowerks beats this with reasonable prices and excellent service.< /review>

< Review>
I had a great experience with European Autowerks. They did a very thorough job with the work that was needed. I originally came in to just get the spark plugs changed for a idling issue. I really appreciated how they took the time and the proper steps to diagnose the real problem as apposed to just changing the plugs and wires. You can tell these guys really hold their work with high standard of excellence. Thanks for the service!<//Review>

My wife and I have tried some of the other European auto repair shops in the area and were completely dissatisfied with their service and with one of them, their lack of honesty. Now that we have found European Auto Werks, we are happy to have an alternative to the dealers. They are professional, deliver the vehicles when promised, and their prices are reasonable. Additionally, I think that I have been treated better there than one of the BMW dealers in San Diego. The office and customer area are always very clean, and smell good!!<//Text>

<Text>When you get a few miles on your high-end vehicle, relatively few people can properly diagnose and fix the problems that arise. Scott and his team have the talent and integrity to put your car back to new condition and always leave the customer with the feeling they have been treated fairly and honestly. European Autowerks provides a shining example of how a business should be run and we are fortunate to have them in our community.</Text><userid>107919239411306602844<//userid>< Rate>

European Autowerks (Quality 1 Auto Repair) does an excellent job in car repair. I was told by BMW that I needed new brakes and when I went to Quality 1 Auto Repair, I was told my brakes were fine but the brake sensor just needed replaced. That saved me a bundle. Everyone that works there is pleasant and friendly and they will drivebyou home and pick you up which is wonderful.< /Text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I requested an appointment through their website during the weekend to get my 07 Mini Cooper S into the shop first thing Monday morning. I received a response promptly Monday morning prior to their store hours that accommodated my request. Jason was helpful and respectful from the get-go. I identified that I had an oil leak and was losing a substantial amount of fluid in a short amount of time and my idle fluctuating between 600-800RPM; not constant. The job required the front end of the car to be disassembled to locate and isolate the leak(s). They identified that the oil cooler gasket and oil filter stand gasket were the cause of my problems. They called me to inform me of the problem and solution prior to conducting the work. Through the process, e-mailed pictures of the location of the leak and the disassembly. They checked all my fluids while conducting the repairs, and informed me that the car was well over due for transmission fluid (provided photos as well). I recently bought the car used with 68k miles, and wouldn't be surprised if it was the original fluid, so I had them change it as well. I also needed new air mass meter boot, the original was held on by the hose clamp tied to a metal hose by a wire. With the amount of work to be done, my car had to be left over night to finish up the work the next day (Tuesday). Jason called me mid morning to tell me everything was put back together and that the engine makes a terrible 'hiss'. Being the boot had been faulty, and likely leaking--not creating a sufficient seal the hiss wasn't noticeable. The PVC valve's diaphragm was faulty and on the verge of failing which would have created a vacuum within the engine and displaced the engine oil. I authorized to have the valve cover replaced (PVC is embedded within). I picked up my Cooper Tuesday evening. She sounded great. I no longer had an idle problem. She ran great. I am a happy customer. I HIGHLY recommend them. I will be a return customer!! Thanks again guys!</Text></record>

Very professional staff. My daughter had to drop off our 2005 VW Golf because I was unavailable. They treated her with respect and didn't try to have her fix anything else besides what she went in for. Thanks Jason. Look forward to bringing the car back.< /review>

< Review>
Take a trip back in time when customer service was the number one priority and you might just end up at European Autowerks. These guys not only did what they promised, when they promised, they went the extra mile. Not to mention that my car was dirty when they got it and beautiful when they gave it back! I now have a service partner for my Porsche.< /Review>

<review>Brought in my 2011 Mini-cooper S countryman for the first time to European Autowerks for an oil change and overall check of the vehicle. The service was great! Follow-up was on spot, and the personnel were very friendly and professional. Definitely have found my new mechanic.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1520965637491, 'text': 'Thank you Veronique for the Amazing Review.

The service was amazing, I am now going to take my car to to European Autowerks from now on. I came across this place by accident, I was looking for a mechanic on my iphone that could do my brakes and was close by, since I have always taken my car to the Dealer in Escondido. When I walked in and seen Scott I knew this is where I needed to be. I worked with Scott many years ago and he was always the best mechanic we had. I am confident in European Autowerks, they are professional and friendly, and I know that it will be done right.< /review>

<name>Nathaniel Law<//name><date>1536252470558< /date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>They wouldn't listen to me and demanded to do a several thousand dollar workup before replacing the simple part I wanted replaced.  The lady in front of me was also arguing with them about their refusal to do just what she wanted.  I was lucky to have gotten my car the Hell out of there and to a shop that would listen to their customers.

To reiterate:  This was for European Autowerks.  A-U-T-O-W-E-R-K-S.

I am somewhat amused that they claim not to remember me.  I would have thought that a shop manager being combative with two back-to-back customers would have made more of an impression.  I guess they yell at all their customers.

Take your German cars elsewhere.</text>< Pictures>

Every experience I have had at European Autowerks has been excellent. Both myself and my parents drive older model Mercedes (1994 E300 D and a 2000 CLK430) which can get to be temperamental. The guys over at European Autowerks perform excellent service for a fair price, and after their initial fix on my CLK I was happy to refer my mother to them as well. I just had my spark plugs changed (all 16 of them, V8 problems) and they took the time to fix my engine performance as well. It had been lagging for some time, and now my car runs like new!

5 stars and they will always have my patronage.< /Review>

< review>
Clutch repair $4,000,00?? Oh if only I had known. Just wanting to trust a hometown repair shop, etc. Very disappointed and Waaayyyyy overpriced. Final result: Now stick is very difficult to shift into reverse and upon complaining of issue, given a wide range of excuses and inconvenience of leaving car for several days to check (twice) Ultimately, lesson learned. Initially , enticing and will have you convinced they're experts. Will never go back.< /review>

My car broke down late at night on my way home from a business trip just 2 days before I was leaving the country on vacation. I had to have my car towed to Quality 1 simply because they were the closest shop that had an overnight key drop box so I had no idea what to expect. Luckily Jason and the rest of the team there were excellent and went above and beyond to accommodate me. They were able to get the problem diagnosed quickly and start the repairs before I left and then coordinated with my insurance while I was away. The car was fixed and ready to be picked up by the time I got home a week later. They took a situation that could have been a communication nightmare and made it a walk in the park. I highly recommend these guys if you are looking for a repair shop that treats you like family even when you are a total stranger.<//Text>

<text>New customers be careful!

This was the worst professionalism I have experienced at a vehicle service center.

I had spoken over the phone to schedule an appointment for an oil change. European Autowerks had told me to come in at 8AM for an oil change and inspection. I asked how long would the inspection last, and they told me since I will be brining the car in early, it wouldn't take that long.

I then arrive the day of the appointment, and the first thing I find is that my name on the list for a later time. After, the serviceman at the counter asks me if I need a ride somewhere. I tell him I will wait for the oil change and then he tells me it will be 4 hours for an oil change. I tell him I have to leave by 10am and he responds by referring me to JiffyLube for a quick oil change.

New customers be careful. They have plenty of business so rather than turn you away, they will waste your time.<//text>< pics>

5 STARS! Ok where do I even start. Both my wife and I own Audi’s and both were having some issues. My wifes car 2006 Audi A3 2.0T was having issues with hard start up , bogging. Random idol control issues... we thought the worst. We brought her car in for a  diagnostic test. They came back and told us it was a simple issue. They went the extra mile and made sure that the 14 codes were looked at. That same day never thinking I was going to smog the car. Well the cars fixed codes are not coming up and we SMOGGED same day!! Wow.

Was so confident I wanted my A/C compressor looked at on my 2009 Audi A5 S-Line 3.2L
Turned out the ac compressor was shot.
They fixed it super fast . Only took them a day or two to fix. I came back to pick it up and it was super clean!! They washed it for me made sure my tire shine looked great. There mechanic came over to me to make sure my wife’s car was fine and wasn’t seeing anything else wrong told them got her smogged by a great place call Nice and Easy Smog.

There communication was SPOT ON. Very easy to talk to. Was referred by my mom and they helped take care of hers also.  10/10 from these guys! The best! Earned my business for life. Yes my car has AC it was super cold going home felt great .

I see the owner replied to this message with a bunch of lies. It's totally up to you guys to go here if you want, but one of their former employees quit there and went to another shop because of all the shady practices going on there. That should tell you something in itself.</Review>< Pics>

As a former independent technician I am very attention to detail on heavyline work. They did 100% honest work and we're very communicative with me about my mother's vehicle (used to be mine but she bought it from me). If your a tech like myself and have 0 time to do major work quality one is your guys to go to. And they cleaned my car!!! They went the extra mile to clean my car!! I will be doing buisness with them agian.</Text>

< Review>
The work is always excellent! This time I was disappointed that my car was not washed properly. Usually my Mercedes is detailed inside and out anx this time it wasn't. There wasn't no sticker for my next oil change in the window, no vacuum was done inside, and I was called 10 minutes before closing to come get my car which made me rush because the guy wanted to leave. Also the mechanics rags were left in my car. I was embarrassed because I had a friend with me. All I can say this was a disappointment on how thibgs are usually done. D Thompson</Review>

The gang at European Autowerks saved me. Passing through Temecula, my 2006 mini cooper started acting up and had trouble starting. I was able to get my car into the shop first thing the next morning- and they diagnosed my battery and had it replaced by the early afternoon. While doing a complete service check they did discover a sliced transmission boot and severely contaminated fluid (emailed me photos before calling to discuss). They were able to repair my mini and get it back up to order within a day and a half. As I was in the middle of a trip - These guys being able to repair everything, with only two days down (although stuck in Temecula) just before continuing on a 600 mile drive - was amazing.<//Text>

<text>Very “down to earth people.”  Explaned all the work that needed to be done in detail on my BMW 528. In fact, when I went to pick up my car, the price was less then quoted, as they were honest enough to let me know there was A part they thought I originally needed, that I did not after further investigation. It was very nice to see this kind of honesty.

My car also needed tires, and although they do not sell them, they took my car to a local shop and got that handled for me too.  One less stop for me.

In addition they drove me home and picked me up when my car was done!  Also had free soda and watter for their customers; that was a small but very thoughful gesture!

My car was running really rough but now purrs like a Kitten! Owning a german Car can be expensive, but I fealt like I got a fair deal and great service! As long as I trust the business I work with they will have a loyal customer!  On top of everything the parts and service was covered under warenty for 3 years!  Thank you guys...I feel like I’m driving a new car again!  Also thank you for replacing the batteries on my key Fobs!  Another nice thoughful gesture!  If your looking for quality service at a fair price, give these guys a chance to earn your business!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1517445536286, 'text': 'WOW, Tod, thank you so much for taking the time to write us such an Amazing review..'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Quality Auto has serviced both my C-class & E-class sedans for 8 years now. I have had 4 bad experiences recently with the new Fletcher Jones dealership in Murrieta & I wish I had never given them a try. The whole staff at Quality is friendly, prompt & courteous. Quality came highly recommended to me by a friend who has his MBZ serviced with them & now please consider my recommendation of Quality to you. There are a lot of service shops in Temecula to choose from, even big dealerships, but Quality truly is #1.</text>

<Text>I brought my BMW M5 in a little over a year ago and in that time it was driven less than 2k miles. I had them change the input seal on the differential. While they were doing that job they also inspected the driveshaft. Fast forward to early March I brought my M5 into Autohaus Frankfurt to have some work done. They informed me that only 2 bolts were left installed where my driveshaft meets the flex disc and only one of them still had a nut on it and the other was loose. I contacted European Autoworks and all they said was that I can bring it in for them to look at. I told them that was not possible due to it being torn apart for a rod bearing change. They said oh well and the only option I have is to bring it in. I asked for them to pay for the work that had to be corrected and they refused.

Also be aware that their complimentary shuttle service is with customers cars. They picked me up in another customers BMW 740 while it was on a test drive. They also allowed me to install my child's car seat in this car. I don't know about you but I would be furious if that was my car. All in all expensive shop that was negligent on their repairs on my car and didn't stand behind their work. They could of caused me to have a serious accident because of their shoddy work.

Do not go here there are far better options close by.</Text></record>

Took my Volvo S60 in for an oil change with the check engine ligh on. Upon further inspection and testing the team at European Autowerks informed me the Leak Detection Pump was failing. I thought, I would have to wait an extra day or more to have my vehicle repaired, but the team at European Autowerks was able to remove, replace, test the pump and return my vehicle before the close of business. Thank you European Autowerks< /Text>

I suppose 1 star for effort. I took my Mercedes AMG for a Service A change and paid over $1000.00. The next day, the coolant message appeared. Then about 3 weeks later the low oil symbol came on. Naturally first think that pops into my mind is that a mechanic did not even touch my car. So I go to Autozone and they said the oil was below minimum. So I had to buy 3 bottles of oil to put in. Absolutely ridiculous!!!! I took the car back to Autowerks so upset. All they did is put another bottle of oil in. My car is a 2010 Mercedes with no problems in the  engine. They tried to tell me maybe the car is leaking oil.  Yae right!! Terrible places.  I felt so robbed. Terrible. And to top it all off when i picked up my car the windows where down, dust was all over the dash and they didn't even wash my vehicle. For $1000 oil change, couldn't even get a car wash!!!!!
Bet autowerks will respond with such a defensive statement!!!!! Let's wait to see!!!<//text>

WORTH THE DRIVE TO TEMECULA. I purchased my 2011 Audi A3 TDI three months ago and it was due for an oil change. My Audi is my first highly engineered European car and because of where I live I will put many twisty miles on it. I am determined to keep this car in tip top shape, providing me with excellent drivability, comfort and fuel savings. I'm so happy that I found Scott and his excellent team of trained car mechanics at European Autowerks/Quality 1 Auto Service in Temecula. My car was thoroughly inspected and additional clean fluids were found to be necessary in order to avoid creeping damage to vital parts (transmission, brakes). Pictures were provided that showed diagnostic results, and Scott carefully explained everything to me about the reasons for the additional fluids. We had a great conversation that contrasted his approach to car maintenance vs a dealership's. I can expect a thorough inspection every time I bring in my Audi and a report with pictures that will support any needed maintenance. Because every driver puts demands on their vehicles differently, I really appreciate this approach as notified preventive maintenance. I hope know this will help me to become a better driver. I love my Audi. I'd be very unhappy without it.< /Text>

Ist time there and prices were pretty good. When I got home there was like spray marks all over my windows. Possibly because it was so hot the window spray dried before could be wiped off?</review>

The employees do a great job always!!! But the owner really needs to hire more people especially on a Saturday the wait is over an hour!! And thats only due to being under staffed!!! Staff works really fast and does good.<//Text>

<Review>I bring my 2014 Corvette Stingray here a couple times a month. They do a great job with the $20 wash but for $60+ waxing it is great!  The guys are nice and listen to any special requests.  The washer does not touch the car.  There is a pre-wash to remove or loosen the bugs, then the drive through (no touching), then the hands of dry and finished.  I really like this place and recommend it to custom car owners.< /Review>< pics>

<text>We were Amazed at the young gentleman that basically walks with your car and washes it as it goes in the machine! In San Diego we drive thru the machine! It was a different experience. A nice LOUNGE FREE WIFI area with drinks .. Pretty Amazing! Glad I picked this one out of all the others! Very nice & Respectful.<//text>< pictures>

Great service except for a couple persons that don't dry your car right... come here often LOVE how they wash it and the workers very polite & respectful...except for a couple persons that dont dry your car right leave it stained and get mad if you ask to dry/clean again...Only one worker that dries/cleans cars is GREAT AND POLITE...maybe the owner should be here more often like when he just opened< /Text>

Car wash was good on the outside but as soon as I stepped inside I see my rear-view mirror dangling from some wires, and if that's not bad enough the glass was cracked too. So now I have to go to my dealer have them fix this and hopefully, Paradise auto spa, will keep their word and pay for the damages.</Text>

<Time>1616273690639<//Time><Text>Currently living here this place has some strong points and strong cons. The property is split into a Apartment side and a Condo side. As far as the property it's nice kept clean and nice scenery. A down fall is a large lack of parking for people with more than one vehicle. Living on the Condo(HOA) side you only get one assigned parking. So for people who have more than one car  are going to struggle. There is a new parking  rules implemented  that is happening on the apartment side  that with out a permit you will have your car towed. They do have a tow company that comes regularly to take cars. ALSO get a clear map of the diveded property because there isn't any signs that show you  where the Condo and apartment side split.As of now when contacting the manager they have no ressolution for people in the Condo side and basically  tell you to figure it out for a parking ressolution for your other vehicles. So there clearly is a huge division and it  isn't being addressed in the best way. Other than this issue it would have been a great. Just a heads up.</Text></record></dataset><record>

This place looks beautiful in the entrance but living here is horrible. Looks are deceiving, you might as well spend less at an uglier apartment complex because this place is roach infested anyway. Management is horrible, parking sucks, noisy ghetto neighborhood. Don’t waste your money!<//Text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Be careful signing your lease here and make sure you do a walk through before you do. They also charge a 100 holding deposit which they will tend to keep due to processing your application over the allotted time, takes weeks before they do any verifications to approve your application. Therefore you lose your deposit because you only get 72hrs to get a refund. The complex also only looks nice in the front, drive through the back. Tons of broken down cars , no wonder there's no parking and it should be a prime example on the management and maintenance procedures. Good luck!!< /review></record>

I’ve lived at the Lido’s for almost 9 years. I love that they take great pride in keeping the grounds neat and well manicured.  The office staff is friendly and the manager, Jennifer, very caring and professional. I have always felt very safe here.  It’s a wonderful place to call home.<//review>

Lived in Lydo for three years in 2 different units; one of my apartments was robbed when I wasn't home, and a crazy dude tried to break-in at the other spot, and I had to chase him out. Horrible neighborhood, the management at the apartment was great, but no joke, pay a little extra to live somewhere safer. Also, the parking was horrible.</text>

I’ve only lived at the lidos for 4 months, I’ve never had an issue with bugs, I’ve never had an issue w/ theft. The water has never turned brown, but it was shut up for a couple of hours due to pipe issues (management will inform you about these things if you ask during lease signing as I did)  they do give you a letter saying clean off your porch if things are on it besides a gas bbq and patio furniture but they’ve never threatened to fine me for it (they say not to leave things on your porch, so that people don’t feel the need to steal.... Its a safety thing. I have had issues with the sink, due to the apartments being older, things are going to break, or need a little TLC because the complex is old (take that into consideration when moving in) the maintenance has a big complex to cover... while cleaning up after the mess people leave around so it will take them a bit to get to your needs (having patiences is key). My neighbors can be loud but that’s the risk you take moving into an apartment and not a house, you have to share the environment so my family don’t mind. It’s a cool and quiet place to live while we save up for a house(: hope this helps anyone looking to move in.< /Review>

A kid almost was robbed for his AirPods, and sketchy people walking around at night, screaming, fights, and honking horns, etc. !!!DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!

The best part about this community is the pools and the nice people that could possibly be met here.</Review>

If i have problems i litterally have to walk the grounds looking for a maintenance worker to come in and fix my plumming issuse with the sink!! Water turns brown and tub feels up with nasty sewer water!! Roach and termite issuses. The staff walks around and your not allowed to have anyrhing on your porch but a chair or they treaten to fine you.heaven forbid you have kids with toys!!

Terrible place to live at. Same your time and money and go somewhere else cause this is not the place to live at. My apartment always had roaches and maintenance would come and “spray”, don’t know what they sprayed or if they did it at the right spot cause they always came back. My dryer was making a loud noise every time we dried clothes and it took them about 3 months to come fix it. Our bathroom tub was peeling and they never came to fix it. My last couple months I got a puppy and paid the pet deposit and never saw it again nor my apartment deposit. If you called the office they would hardly pick up. If I could give this place zero stars I would.</Text>

<Text>There's no reason for anyone to move here, so this is more of a list of reasons why this is a fact.
Black mold that goes unchecked until you withhold rent. Bugs and roaches in the walls. Terrible parking with assigned spots that other residents don't abide by. The gate rarely works and when it does people just line up,so really it's just a nuisance instead of a security feature. There's a lot of crime in the complex. The laundry is horrible and dirty. Maintenance takes weeks to fill repair orders.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Time>1567972579776</Time><user_id>104755494900064589150<//user_id>< resp>

We lived at Lido for about a year. The process of getting in to the apartment was great, easy and efficient. We formed a great relationship with the management, Cadence and Mariah, while they were there, and that made the experience very pleasant. We had some issues with the apartment, but they were dealt with during our lease and the apartment was always livable. The amenities were nice, and the main pools were kept clean year round. Jennifer, the current manager, helped us frequently and was consistent with correspondence, making repairs and other issues much easier to deal with. For San Bernardino, and the price range it is in, it is the best option available.< /review>

Noisy neighbors, lots of roaches and termites that are never addressed correctly and also floods when it rains which is also neglected. I wouldn't recommend living here, it's a pain. This will be the second time I have to report to the health and safety department!<//Review>

Worst apartment complex ever. Maintenance is horrible. If something is broke they claim a few days but will take weeks to even send someone over to acknowledge the problem. They never answer the phone at the front office. Have to call countless times and leave countless voicemails. Have had mold in the apartments 3 times. Spiders are all over the stairs of the apartments. They constantly try to raise the price for below average apartments. There are many other places around this area that will care about the tenants. Do not waste your time or money on this place. Worst management I have ever seen.< /text>

The management here is terrible. For one they don't know how to work with people. I lived here almost two years and have had more problems than not. I pay for washer and dryer in home and my dryer was broke for a little over a month and I got no compensation or anything after bringing it up several times. There is never anybody in the office on the condo side, ever. I have been calling as well and can't get connected that way either. There always seems to be some sort of 'emergency' that the water needs to be cut off for hours at a time, a couple times without notice. I also want to be clear that I am not the only one who feels as such. I have several neighbors who could give the same exact stories that they have had on their own. I would not recommend living here if you can do elsewhere just purely based off my experiences with management.< /review>

Have friends that live here. Always clean well lit at night. There is some loitering I've noticed, however, I've never had any issues with anyone. I'm not sure if there is an active security patrol but I'm happy to say I've never needed to find out. Floorplans are spacious, up to date & clean.<//review>

Have hated every minute of living here . Please please please look elsewhere unless your standards are extremely extremely low and your other option is living behind a dumpster . It pisses me off to have to pay them a cent every month . The apt is fugly .. the appliances are trash and from the fifties.. nobody fixes anything..they turn off the water for several hours at least 2 times , again AT LEAST 2 TIMES A WEEK!!!!! FOR HOOOOOOUUURRRSS! Blaming pipe issues , whatever! The parking is HORRIBLE! If you're not home by 8 (EVERYDAY) good luck on finding a spot. RUN RUN RUN! Oh and management ignores you after the day you sign your lease.. once you're trapped , you're trapped.< /Review>< GmapID>

I’ve been living here 5 years, this summer during peak heat temperatures my air conditioner has been broken 5 different times leaving unit at 105 degrees.  They keep patching it but not fixing it. It’s currently three digits in unit yet again and they “ hope to fix it tomorrow “. Find somewhere else to live.< /Text>

DO NOT MOVE HERE!!! If I could leave no stars I definitely would. I was originally supposed to move into one unit. They had 1 month to clean and fix whatever. Upon the weekend of my move I was told the unit still wasnt ready I was asked to switch units at the last minute. *Should have seen the first red flag* Within 2 weeks of the Unit I moved into I noticed an absurd amount of roaches, notified the office and they sent out pest control that didnt help so I had to do my own pest control. Within 3 days my hot water heater needed to be replaced. Within 2 months, my kitchen drain broke and it flooded underneath my sink. The washer had rust rings around the lid, it was obviously not cleaned. New neighbors moved in upstairs from my unit and discovered the last tenants left laundry in the dryer. The sink in the master bathroom kept filling up with water and took about an hour to completely drain. The maintenance men do patch jobs then it's back to square one. I had to deal with these issues for the whole year I lived there. They're quick to take your money but not quick to fix anything. Oh, and when I got my keys I was told if they had to fix things repeatedly in the apartment I would have to pay for it, which is BS because these were all obvious issues before I even moved in. I walked into the office in July of this year and saw a woman with anger on her face she walked up to the girl on the office pissed because she said she'd just moved in 3 days prior and she had roaches, Idk what unit she came from. They send out letters regularly regarding bedbugs. They regularly shut the water off for hours without notice. These apartments are trash please DO NOT MOVE HERE! Think of yourself and if you have children PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE think of them. They are sheisty as hell and charge $1500 for rent because of the location not the quality of their units.</review>

Great staff, fast and friendly maintenance, cool hill to climb behind the apartments, next to the university, walking distance from Baker's, Stater Brothers and Rite Aid, and very clean and well kept grounds. The only truly negative thing is that the apartments are in San Bernardino and some crime bleeds from the bad areas nearby. Our family no longer live in apartments but if we did then we would certainly consider living at Lido again.<//review>

This place is so annoying. We put in our 30 day notice and they never told us the amount we would owe for the pro rated amount of 10 days into the month. So we assumed we would pay it on the day we turn in the keys. We got a notice before our move out date even was up saying we owe all full amount of rent plus late fees. And we also requeated for 3 months for our floor to be fixed and our carpet  was tearing with the carpet tacks sticking out and they never came to fix it. They never answer there phones either. We call and call and call and leave messages and never hear anything back. So glad to be leaving.<//Text>

Do not move here this is the worst place ever all the money that you are spending and things are still not getting fixed. I just moved out and before I did they had all the pools closed saying it's a maintenance thing. There is a VERY BAD ROACHES PROBLEM and when they do spray stuff doesn't work it makes it worse. Finally the new manager Jennifer she thinks she is the finest thing ever with her rude attitude she needs to fix it before somebody fixes her. So final warning do not move into these apartments unless you just need it to be close to the University then go ahead but you still shouldn't. Also I read on facebook I love San Bernardino page and it said it's crazy how they find a dead body in the pool bathroom and they don't even put a letter on the door they just let people back in the pool like it wasn't nothing so yea please don't stay here.</review>

Bathrooms to the gym are always dirty and disgusting. They rarely seem to have any maintenance available to clean up the mess around the property. Trashed are thrown outside of the dumpsters sometimes. People have had break ins on their vehicles many times when they should have more surveillance cameras on site. There are mice, possums, the ceiling was falling apart in one of the apartments, the rent is very expensive for a place that can’t even take simple care of their tenant’s needs. I’m glad I never rented an apartment there after knowing somebody personally who has lived on the property.< /Review>

I can't stress the issue how this place is so bad! It may look cute but it's only the front interence. The first week I moved here ONE OLDER  MAN DIED BY GETTING STAB GOING TO HIS CAR! This was 2016 going into 2017 If you don't believe me call the station and ask.
They never ever fix ANYTHING! They do what ever to keep your money! And I can't tell you HOW MANY TIMES THEY TURN OFF YOUR WATER BECAUSE OF PLUMING ISSUES. ALL THE STAFF ARE RUDE . But nice as hell when you are first moving in.
Only the office pool works nothing else ...they NEVER CLEAN THE GYM.
And DID I MENTION  ALOT OF FIGHTS AND RUDE PEOPLE MOVE HERE THEY DON'T CARE WHAT RECORD YOU HAVE THEY JUST WANT YOUr MONEY.
MOVE HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK.. BUT I PROMISE YOU ONCE YOU LEAVE THIS PLACE you'll be right under me LEAVING THE SAME COMMENTS!< /review>< pics>

<userid>104291580231002593632<//userid><Review>Two of my cars got broken into. They had time to steal my whold speaker system with out anyone hearing about it. There was change all over the floor, VERY low security. After it being reported, management said they would do something but nothing happened. Don't live here if you own a Honda. Don't live here if you are a student trying to get by. Prices are not worth living here. When you first pull into these apartments it looks like the hilton, as soon as you get to the back it looks like a motel 6 with sofas and junk all over the back. The jacuzzi doesnt work , its always warm and not clear to step in. These apartments are easy to break into so if you have valuebles try to hide them upon moving in because if anyone sees what you have they will break in.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c353d3be9290af:0xa6ba020fc499dc39<//GmapID><date>1461971858887< /date><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp></record>

This place has been a headache the whole 7-8 months I've been here. Repairs take forever. The management is sluggish and unprofessional when dealing with complaints. I've been dealing with extremely loud and disruptive upstairs neighbors for 2 months and am barely starting to get somewhere. At one point I was told that I was harassing them!<//Review>

<Text>Wanted to take a couple minutes out of the day to say thank you to Window Design Group. They did a great job completing our 16 windows installation. Ran into a major hick up due to the whole COVID19 issue but they kept us informed and ensured that work did not stop once Installation started. Owner kept us informed of how the whole process was going to be from start to finish. He did not go over our set budget and numbers didn’t change from what our initial contract was. Even after the job was completed he continued to follow up to ensure everything was good and ensured that he sent out his workers for any small issues that may had come up. 5 stars !!!<//Text>< name>

If I could give them A+ I would. I was without a doubt impressed with the quality of work Jenna and team completed. They showed up on time each day and made sure the work was completed as if it was their own house. They completed 16 windows installation. Their work was meticulous and exceeded all my expectations. I expanded my initial project request and Jenna and team did not blink an eye and provided me with an updated estimate and time frame. I would use them again without hesitation.</Review>

Excellent work was done fast. Clean up was good. The supervisor and the workers were kind and stuck to the task at hand. The windows look great and we notice a difference in the temperature in the house. We are now able to get by with just the use of space heaters. Saving us on our gas and electric bill. I would definitely recommend.<//Review>

We had three window companies come to discuss our window replacement needs and to provide estimates. We chose Window Design Group because we believe they had the best product and they said they could custom build the windows to the triangular specs that we wanted to replace the existing windows in the upper part of the raised (cathedral) ceiling. The rep. we dealt with was very willing to lower his bid by $100 to match the bid we received from one of the other window companies. The installers did a beautiful job....not an easy task installing such large windows in the ceiling space. The finished product looks better than we had anticipated and we are very very pleased with the company, the people associated with the company, and of course the windows.< /Text>

From the beginning January 2020, Chris did a fabulous job detailing all of our options for our two story Irvine, CA home. We selected the plantation shutters for our 30 windows and a few were interior window frame installed (around custom window frames) and most were around the windows and glass doors.

Chris brought out samples for us to choose from and from beginning to end he covered all of the details and provided extremely competitive pricing, (best we found).

Yesterday all of our shutters were installed by Spencer who did a great job of installation and also explaining shutter use and maintenance. Spencer followed up today to ensure all was satisfactory.

Chris followed up today to ensure we were happy.

We highly recommend the Window Design Group with an extremely positive experience and finished product being nicely installed.</Review>

<response>None<//response><Text>I filled out the online form for a callback but the submit button doesn't give any indication that the request has gone through. In trying to debug it I ended up submitting several requests (I now understand that this is a known site issue that is unresolved). Janet gave me a call while I was in a meeting. I stepped out to say it wasn't a good time and I'd call back. Under her breath, Janet's response was, "Then why'd you fill out the form so many times," before hanging up on me. When I called back, I was luckily connected with the manager, who was understanding and apologetic. Still, this very avoidable, negative experience placed a high hurdle between this group and my business. Janet called back a few hours later to apologize, which I very much appreciated, but she couldn't tell me why I should consider working with them, given my negative experience. After a deeper look, it appears that a large number, possibly the majority, of the five star reviews for this company are fake, likely paid for, written under accounts with only a single review. The most popular window treatment companies in the region have at most a few dozen reviews, and these guys have hundreds?< /Text>< gmapID>

Guy was extremely thorough and easy to work with. The windows inspection he compiled for us essentially saved us from buying a windows that would have ended up being too big for the space we have. I would highly recommend his home services.< /text>

From the first day of presenting a contract to the last day of touch-ups, it was a positive experience.
Tech on site every day work was being done. He chose only the best, experienced subs to do the work. I will certainly use them for my next project.< /text>

My window looks great but I cannot remove the screen which was not explained to me by Justin the owners son. I have tried numerous times to contact him and he will not return my calls. So I contacted customer service had a gentleman come out to show me how to remove the screen and he wasn’t able to and said he would report this back to the company no response after several weeks. I contacted Janet in customer service and she acted dumb to the whole thing. She was going to contact me back after seeing the photo I sent her and talk to repair service. I tried calling again asking for Janet and she did not take my call and did not return my call. This is very frustrating dealing with them and I would not recommend replacing your windows with them because they don’t back up their product !<//Text>

<Name>Jose Rodriguez<//Name><Time>1582575490177</Time><Rating>1</Rating><text>Worst company I have ever dealt with. Chris (Window design group rep) came and gave me an estimate back in July of 2019. I told him I needed to refinance my house so If its a long process I would rather wait. He assured me that it would be done by the end of September. It's almost March 2020 and they are not finished yet.

WDG sent some young guys to do the installation. I don't have a problem with them being young but I do have a problem with them not acting professional or doing the job right. My children have never heard me use bad words in my house and I find it extremely rude and unprofessional for my kids to have to hear it from employees of WDG doing work at my house.When they received the wrong windows they didn't notice it until they had taken down the original windows. They put up the original windows with some screws. They didn't come back to fix those windows in over a month. WDG said they had to re-order the windows. The big problem was that those days we had the fires going on. Those two windows were put back on so bad that my house was full of smoke everywhere. The bigger problem is that WDG never even acknowledge it when I have told them about it. They just don't care.

The windows were not properly installed. They let in dirt (which I have pictures of). Chris recommended me to go with the retrofit, he said that's what most customer get that way they keep the original look of the house style. well, they messed up one of my windows with that has a view to the front. They completely messed it up inside and out and they have yet to fix it even when I have multiple emails saying they would. I didn't schedule an appointment because they want to fix it, but won't tell me they will fix it to the way it was before to keep the same look. It looks real bad because there are two windows in the front and they used to match.

If you do decide to hire them, be careful. They don't care to go by what the law says. Chris was ready to close the deal changing my windows. Then I mentioned to him that another company I had contacted said that one of my windows wasn't compliant for egress law. Then he agreed and changed it. They had to do new construction because they made the window bigger. I wasn't % sure is you need to pull permits when you do retrofit but I was 100% sure you need it for new construction. They didn't pull any permits for anything they did. I asked WDG to provide me with the permit for the new construction window and eventually they emailed me permits for 11 windows retrofit (that's not even half the windows they did). I took that permit to ask to the city and I was told they needed to provide me with permits for all the windows. They also wanted to break one of my walls to install an 8 foot sliding door which I never saw a permit for. After All the bad installations they did for simple retrofit windows and how bad of work they did with the new construction window I refused to let them install the sliding door. They left the beam and 2x4 wood they were going to use outside on my yard (which they are still there). Eli came to do an inspection which they had refused to do for at least 1-2 months and said they should not have left it there because the wood goes bad with the moisture but yet the installers left it there with the intention of using it. I don't feel that WDG has competent installers and will not let them do an 8ft whole on my wall and feel unsafe in my own house. They have refused to cancel the sliding door and charged the full amount for the whole job even though non of it is completed and they still have the sliding door in their possession.
I currently have a dispute for the charges and i'm in the process of hiring an attorney for all the damages done to my property and the bad windows installed.<//text>< pics>

I am thankful to Chris and the team for providing an excellent service!!
From my initial request, Chris understood the vision of my project.
The guys are skilled ,professional, cooperative and prompt.
They fulfilled all my requirements within our budget and without compromising the quality.
We got many compliments for the windows.

I would recommend their work to all who are looking for a genuine quality work.
Keep up the great work!< /Review>

<text>If you need energy efficient windows, you should contact this company. Excellent workmanship and professionalism all the way.
The owner was very thorough going over the details of everything , about cost and scheduling.
Their guys worked very hard and did a beautiful job!
They had masks and glovers every day .They would let me know immediately if there were any delay.
The attention to the details is outstanding. I love the new windows.<//text>< pictures>

Window Design Group is truly top-notch. Their team is extremely professional and dedicated to doing a quality job. We have done two window installation projects of significant scope with Window Design Group. The installer was attentive and responsive to every detail. If all contractors provided this level of quality and customer service, home improvement projects would be much more pleasant to live through. I recommend them!< /text>

Window Design Group was great.
Notable:
1. They called in extra workers to get the job finished by the end of the day. I did not ask them to do this, they just made sure the job was finished on time.
2. They expertly moved and re-screwed the clips for any window blinds where moving them was necessary.
The windows look great and the house is much warmer in the winter.</Review>

<text>HORRIBLE company. I ordered windows 3 months ago and i get a phone call the day before installation that my windows are damaged and there is an additional delay of 3-4 weeks.
No compensation offered, no phone call back. No integrity with this company.
Absolutely avoid having your windows manufactured and installed by the Window Design Group.
I will be filing a small claims case with the organization this week.
Couldn't be more frustrated with this company.
They were happy to take my deposit and balance months before they finished "manufacturing" .
Do not get scammed by them. There are plenty of other organizations who operate with a much higher sense of integrity and customer service.

The ads posting 5 stars must be left by their own employees or something. Who knows</text></record></dataset><record>

I can't say enough about how great my experience was working with Kevin, Jenna, and the team.
They captured everything that I was looking for and completed the window installation  so fast.
This is my first time getting windows replaced so i had no experience and had one hundred questions. A special thanks for Kevin who helped me out so much and he is always ready to help.< /Review>

<Text>This business has been awful to deal with. A project that started in November has still not been completed. After multiple missed appointments and poor communication to repair and complete a project that I fully payed for, I have had to go to outside help to try and recoup the money paid to have someone else come and complete the job they were unable to. This business is extremely unorganized, very poor follow up and the time frame to get anything completed is horrific. Do your research before hiring a company and please hire someone else, as this company will take your money, not complete the work and cause unneeded work on your part to try and hold them accountable.</Text>< pictures>

The technicians arrived and quickly got to work removing the window. They had it out and fully replaced within an hour. They showed me their completed work and honestly, I had to ask if they had managed to repair the previous window - it didn't look like any surrounding wood, etc. had been disturbed. As if that wasn't good enough, they noticed my window screen was in need of repair and they surprised me with a new screen. The technicians truly went above and beyond!<//Text>

We replaced the last single pane window in our house before the heat waves and it made a huge difference!  We had Kevin and his team
Assigned to us. Kevin comes out and does the measurements and final inspection himself, which is a testament to the pride he takes in his work.  His installation team was quick, professional, and cleaned up thoroughly.  I would highly recommend this company</review>

Brandon is an excellent salesman. The price is right. We just had 6 windows and 2 patio doors installed by Brandon from Window Design Group. I am thrilled with the professionalism, products and the quality of the installation.
The guys showed up on time and got the job done on time as we discussed before.
Brandon did not take a single penny from us until after the work was completed.
The company took accountability for minor damages and most importantly showed integrity to us as a customer and I am happy to give them 5 stars!!! Great job!< /review>

Kevin and his team did a great job from start to finish.
The stuff are friendly, professional and knowledgeable. We had them remove an existing window in our basement and install a new one.
I would recommend to anyone.< /Text>

<Text>Excellent experience so far! I called around to receive estimates on replacing the last 4 original windows in my house: 2 bathroom windows, living room window and kitchen window. Blake came by to measure the windows and to give me the estimate. The estimate was given at the end of that visit. Of the estimates I received, I went with Blake’s Although his was not the cheapest, he stands by his business and I believed his work was to be the most honest. Blake’s crew came by last week and installed the double paned, low-e, vinyl windows. The windows look amazing. They are definitely an upgrade from the single paned, aluminum windows. Notable points: First, I appreciated how the crew members were very focused on installing the windows correctly in my house as to avoid having leaks because that is what happened to me with another window I replaced in the past. Secondly, they assured me by saying they installs windows in customers' homes as if it was his own home. Next, I appreciated that Blake came by at the end of the install to personally examine the work. I identified a small tear in the screen to one of the windows. Blake said it was an easy fix. He is going to re-order the screen and personally replace it when he gets it. Lastly, the windows are covered by warranty that is transferrable.
I would really recommend this quality company to anyone looking to beat the summer heat and increase their home value. Thank you!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Scheduled a in home estimate two weeks ago for today and “Alex” never showed up during the scheduled 30 minute window. After and hour of waiting, I called to find out what had happened. 5 minutes on hold to be told he had car problems at the previous home and was getting towed at that moment. I’m still wondering why no one called to mention car issues.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

From initial appointment to installation took about three weeks!
The workers were very efficient, they took down the blinds and put them back up, leaving no trace of the work. Really fantastic job in making sure there are no damages.
We were kept informed and lead times were good.
They know their business and absolutely deliver on their promises.</review>

The services we received from Window Design Group was terrific. They had a clear understanding of what we wanted and provided services to those specifications. The Project Manager, was easy to deal with and kind and his knowledge of product and team was outstanding. Ultimately we are very happy with the end result and will use them in the future for any and all other construction needs.<//review>

Chris and his team repaired and re-installed a glass railing in our house that was installed improperly by the previous owner.  It was a chore finding someone who could fix it, let alone show up for the appointment.  Chris and his team were very nice, professional and hard-working.  Very happy w/ the whole team -including the lady who handled the calls. Will use again in future.<//text>

It was not easy to find many window installation companies around Simi valley.... they were all far and didn't rush to come over to give me an estimate.. they were quick to come over the next day and offered me a good price for a sliding glass door that I can not imagine not having it now! I love it!</text>

They did such a great job replacing all 9 dual pane, low E, windows, an all glass shower and a shower door. Their entire staff is understanding, and they truly understand that you are under a lot of stress having workers in your house... always polite and informed me if they needed to go to the electrical closet to fix something. Did an excellent job on the measuring and implementation!

The quality and pricing was excellent and service was fast. Thank you, Chris for great choices!</review>

They were quick to respond to our inquiry and were able to book the estimate within the same week.
Interaction with Vincent was pleasant and he had great ideas for the design of the kitchen windows and our new guest house windows
I really enjoyed working with him. It was not a small job and he was always around. Came up with solutions for any issues.
Always returns calls always reachable!

Highly recommend them for High End projects.< /text>

<review>Worst company to deal with . Started my project in August 2019 and finish it March 2020..
The company has 2-3 technicians and they keep on accepting new jobs that they can not fulfill .
Complete scam .. would not recommend it to anyone.. Already reporter them to consumer affairs and Business bureau .</review>< pictures>

I just put the down payment for my new house and as soon as i moved in i realized the windows are all older since they renovated it a while back. I immediately started searching for companies and after an extensive search i chose to hire them. They were the first ones to come to my property and started the work immediately. Amazing crew very professional.</Text>

The pricing is very competitive. I was able to go to the company and see how they manufacture the windows which was super nice. After we received the windows we ran into some issues but the owner personally acknowledged the mistake and took responsibility to make sure we get our replacements. Everyone makes mistakes. We love the windows. They look great and work amazingly.< /text>

<Review>This was the WORST experience I have ever had. First, I sat down with the sales man in May. Who promised the job would be done in July. That didn't happen because it is November 26 and I'm still waiting for them to finish the job.
They removed my spigot and then wouldn't replace it. Leaving me with no water in my backyard. Even though the sales man assured me they would move it. I was getting door put in where a window was, they turn that down so the whole area was open. They found that the pipe was in the way. So I got a plumber to move it but they said they couldn't come back for 1 month because they were so busy. I have my 90 yr old father on oxygen living with me and I told them the house could not be open to outside like that. So they came the next day to drywall the inside. They couldn't texture because it needed to dry. We are now in October. Then the end of October they they did the outside. Now know they do not replace any of your fixtures the move, they just leave all the parts laying in the backyard. When I called about this because, of course, I am not happy about how this project to see when they could finish, I was told after Thanksgiving.  I, of course, felt this was punishment for complaining. One other thing, way back in September  I got a call from them asking for the total payment. I told them I wasn't going to pay until work had start and then when it finished to my satisfaction.  This is a nightmare company and I will never use them again. Beware.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I received two quotes prior to the sales person coming out.  The quote I received was $2,000 higher than them and since they price match I sent them the quotes after the sales person requested them. I never received a reply after sending quotes so they obviously have no interest in standing by their price match guarantee.  How can a company justify being over 2k over milgard windows?  Get several quotes before doing business with them.</Review>

<Text>John came to my house to measure the window on 12/27/14, the order was placed.  1/3/15 they sent another guy to do more detailed measurement.  I was told that it will take 5-6 weeks to have the shutter installed.

Three months passed, I still haven't received my shutter....  I send few emails to John, never responded, Called many times, can't get a date.   Finally I was called this week and was told that the shutter will be installed 3/31/15...  Three long months waiting, it better be good.

I guess there are many other places to shop for shutters, I certainly DO NOT recommend this one

Finally received my shutter on 3/31/15.   Quality is good.    They need to improve customer service

I have used Window Design Group 2 times now. Once to replace windows and shortly after to install 4 large custom fitted sliding doors.
Their work was as promised and looked better than I thought it could. All of the installation was done neatly with no mess. The trim around the patio doors makes it all look great.
I received a follow up call shortly after the install to make sure I was satisfied and I was beyond satisfied.</text>

<Text>The grandson of the man who started the company came to my home and I wanted to switch out 2 sliding glass doors and 2 small windows.  They scheduled an apt a week later to come take measurements,  Before they came back out I decided to move and consequently would not need to replace the doors & windows.  I called them and they said I would have to complete the work because it was 24 hours after the cancelation period.  This makes no sense because their was nothing ordered and they had not even measured.  The gentleman they told me to speak with will only send emails and not return my call. The office told me I am responsible for connecting with him.  I offered to pay for the initial appointment which was less than 20 minutes ( $574)  and they are still being difficult.<//Text><user_name>Heidi Planck<//user_name><UserId.>112357362725436200541<//UserId.>< Pics>

So happy we used this company! A couple of weeks ago, we noticed that it was a lot colder in our daughters room for some reason. Come to find out, that the window had a giant crack and was off the track. Our daughter is only 9 months, so we needed to get this fixed ASAP. After talking about it with a few coworkers, we were referred to this company, so we decided to check it out! Our initial phone conversation was with Tanya and she was great! She completely understood the need for getting this fixed as soon as possible and sent someone out to look at it the same day. Brandon was the one who came to give us an estimate, and he was awesome. He told us what needed to be done, the cost and when they could do it. They did a WONDERFUL job, pricing was great and the way they accommodated us, really sets them apart. We can't thank you guys enough!< /Review>

Seems as if the majority of the public writes reviews when unsatisfied unless you are a self proclaimed "yelper". Regardless, I am very busy and was actually asked to write a review about my positive experience. I wish I would have thought to write a review on my own accord. I ordered windows and shutters from the Window Design Group back in August and was visited by a representative named Chris. I had 2 quotes for windows prior and suffered through extensive presentations about the science of windows. I had not gotten another quote for shutters. Chris was a breath of fresh air to my extremely busy life and was not a time bandit at all. He told me what was important about windows and why as well as having a fair and honest price. By the time the shutters came around and hearing about the warranties on all products, I had made my decision. My windows were INSTALLED only 3 weeks later. My shutters took longer than expected however Chris told me they were delayed IN our appointment and was honest with me. 3 weeks and some change after the windows were put in my shutters were installed and the quality was as expected in comparison to the great windows. There were a couple chips on the shutters I notice after a few days. The next day they had someone out touching it up(it was on the inside panels) The NEXT DAY. I've recommended twice since my installation and have no regrets doing so.< /Review>

Do NOT under any circumstances use this company!!!! Your drunk uncle who knows nothing about windows and a monkey wearing oven mitts could do a better job. The quality of their product is horrible (Chinese plastic comes to mind.)Their customer service is horrendous and timeliness is awful. If you enjoy frustration and incompetence, along with shady business practices than Window Design Group might be for you, otherwise get your uncle liquored up and find a monkey and you’ll have a much better experience.

We ordered new windows, blinds, and shutters to remodel our house. First of all, our initial salesperson couldn’t get our order right and couldn’t figure out how to send the e-documents for us to sign. I eventually requested another salesperson. It took over 4 months to complete the project in which they broke and damaged property in our home. And then another 5 months and filing a lawsuit to get them to do anything on the damage.

The company makes every attempt to avoid actually resolving any issues. When we contacted them regarding the damage they stated that we had signed off on the work (which the installers asked us to sign prior to the work actually being completed) and they had no record of us informing them of the damage even though it was their installer who alerted us to the damage and that same installer verbally assured us it would be repaired and we had reported it to at least 3 other workers each time they were in our home within the time period. The company also sends weekly automated emails regarding any complaint and if you do not respond within 3 days they consider the matter closed. After multiple requests to customer service and our salesperson to fix the damage we were refused.

The blinds we received are worse quality than what you could buy at Walmart. The blinds are made of thin plastic and the slats easily fall out of the strings, nor are the slats cut straight to fit the window. One of the windows, that Windows Design Group replaced, the seal on the new window was broken the day they installed it and it took 9 months after install and 5 separate attempts to get them to replace it (they brought the wrong window twice, didn’t bring a tall enough ladder on the third attempt and no showed on the fourth attempt.) After wasting my time on 4 separate occasions waiting for them to install the window the customer service representative said she would compensate me for my time which never happened.

I attempted numerous times to work with their customer service department, our salesperson and even tried calling one of their executives to no avail. We finally filed a claim against Window Design Group in Small Claims Court. We submitted photographs of the damage which was clearly caused during the installation (the broken pieces were put back together with window caulk). We even had a neighbor who was a witness that was there when the damage was done by Window Design Group. Only after filing against them did Window Design Group even attempt to resolve the problem and even then they only agreed to pay for part of the damages. I would never recommend Window Design Group to anyone and you should run screaming away from their company.<//text>

We contracted with in September 2017 to have blinds, shades and valances installed.  The initial visit was very good.  From that point forward, horrendous.  Wrong products, defective products, no call backs, terrible service calls, etc.  On top of this, their billing system basically collects at product ordering and product receipt at their shop.  When they arrive to do the install, you are paid in full with zero recourse.  No less than 5 trips to resolve.  Final product was install in March 2018 - yep 5 months.  And the products were broken.  I have given up and will repair on my own.  Calls to their management go unanswered, they have an inability to track merchandise and service calls, and they basically make service calls based on their schedule and not your schedule.  AVOID!<//Text></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Do not get shutters or any product from this company ever!!!!! They are a total night mare!!!! 7 months to get my shutters and rollers. They give you a good pitch and they do have good prices, but they are totally disorganized. They have sent several installers on several occasions to my house with the wrong products, wasting my time again and again. I have several pictures of the products they have sent with the wrong sizes. Do not buy any products for them, they are a horrible company, 7 months and counting to get an order (I'm still waiting for my shutters and rollers). One of the installers quit and took part of my order with him (I don't blame him for quitting, probably couldn't take the clients complaints and the disorganization anymore). All the one starts reviews are accurate, it has been the worst experience I ever had in my entire life. Do not purchase any product from them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Text>< pics>

<Text>We ordered new windows for a one-day installation back in May of this year (2018).  Over a period of 12 weeks, the windows were put in, but they didn't have the inside moulding to finish off the job. The frame on one window was bent and when they came to replace it, the windows didn't fit, so they just put the old frame back and of course, with no moulding.  The installers tell their supervisors what is needed and we send pictures as asked.  Now it has been 6 MONTHS and the company keeps saying that the manufacturer sends either the wrong color or an insufficient amount to finish the job.  We are so tired of excuses and are looking to see what other recourse we have at this point.  One person after the other said, "I'll be handling this for you exclusively until it is done," and we put our faith in each one.  Now, WE look totally stupid!  Just finish our windows already!  We went with WDG after purchasing new sliders 2 years ago and were ready to update the rest of the windows in our home.  Completely disappointed and wish we had gone with another window company.</Text>< Pics>

Worst company! Run away quickly and don’t look back. As a teacher and Christian, I have never hired a worse company. The installers of the windows were unprofessional and management at the office just as bad. They promoted a Christian value with scripture on a web site, however they upheld no such conduct. My window was ordered too small by them and they spent over 2 months to correct it. Simply awful! Run and don’t look back!<//review>

<time>1526846731094<//time><text>I had my house remodeled recently but the only thing that was missing what new windows... I didn't want to have shatters in some time them.  I looked for companies to do a price match and after speaking with windows design group on the phone, I went with them.

They immediately connected me with a project manager.
He explained to me what type of wood shutters and glass should go where in the house. It made a lot of sense and since he taught me what he is doing I was very relaxed while they were working inside my house.

They put a thicker glass in the upper levels of the house because of the Winds and then we put various as well to not heat the living room. I'm highly satisfied with the way they handled it and made sure I am involved in the process completely.</text>< Gmap_id>

Awesome !  Once I decided on French doors I knew this was he company to look at. They were expensive but I got another quote and they honor the less expensive one . Doors were in as promised and on time . Installation went smooth . The installers were professional and only took about 2 1/2 hours for them to install  both doors. Could not be happier. Thank you it's like having a new house. I can't stop looking at my doors they are beautiful .< /review>

Window Group helped us replace our garage door window and inserts... ours was old and ugly window design. they did a whole brand new set of replacement garage door window inserts. Change up the style made a big difference on how we feel when we pull into the garage everyday. We love it!</text>

Excellent! They have good pricing and wonderful customer service. I was referred to Window Design Group by a friend. I had been needing to replace a cracked glass window in my house for quite some time now. I called and spoke to Blake, he was very informative and he helped me set up an onsite estimate. They told me exactly what they would do and how much I would pay, no surprises!:) They showed up on time and replaced my window fast and efficiently. The guys who accommodated me were very professional. Thank you for the terrific service!!!< /text>

Extremely DISHONEST COMPANY.  My only household regret is ever hiring them to replace my window.  Go onto the State Contractors License Board website (www2.cslb.ca.gov), enter this company’s License # (993370) and click on the Complaint Disclosure Information.  You will see that this company has numerous complaints filed against them, and one is pending disciplinary action.  DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY. They will destroy your walls, charge whatever you used to pay the deposit, EVEN IF you do not sign the automatic withdrawal authorization form, claiming that Page 9 of their contract allows them to do so, then they will not take ANY responsibility of the damage, citing ANY excuse they can think of, and leave you with less in your bank account and damaged walls.  Hire a company who will do the job right. This is a garbage company. They send out punk kids to demolish your walls.
DON’T BE TEMPTED BY THEIR LOW PRICES. THEY OFFER THAT BECAUSE OF ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND COMPLAINTS KEEPING THEIR BUSINESS STRUGGLING. DON’T BELIEVE THE POSITIVE REVIEWS. ACCORDING TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER AND REVIEWER THEY WROTE IT THEMSELVES.<//text>

BUYER BEWARE!!!  (PEOPLE THERE SHUTTERS ARE MADE IN CHINA, I CHECKED THEY DONT OWN A SHUTTER FACTORY!!!!) They are buying reviews to cover up bad reviews. On yelp to! Shame on them!  It has been nothing but a nightmare dealing with this companies lies. If I would have known what I know now I would have never done business with this company. To start with the sales person was nice and the shutters looked good. I think that is why I trusted him and ended up ordering, but that was the end of it. The web site says shutters for $13.95 per sq ft so I thought that is what I was paying for them. No, more like $19.95 per sq ft after all the installation and such is added on. That is my fault for not doing the numbers myself and not getting all the pricing correct from the sales person. I was promised that I would have my order in a certain time. Like most of the other reviews here on Yelp I got the run around as well. Port issues with parts? Ya right. More like the shutters are made over seas and they are not being truthful to their customers. If they are the manufacture and they need "hinges and magnets" instead of making customers angry there are plenty of places you can get shutter parts the next day or in a couple days. I was able to go onto Amazon and found bulk shutter parts that you can get in two days. When you tell them you want to go see where they are made, they say in Long Beach is where I was told, when I called and talked to a girl who said she just started working there. She said that for insurance purposes you cannot go there, but all I wanted is the address. They say they make them, but when doing research they do not have any other address other that the Simi Valley showroom location. I would think that if they did make them the address would be listed for insurance purposes. Don't do it!!< /review>

I arranged an appointment for an estimate a week in advance and told them I couldn't do it before 1:30 in the afternoon. They saidok and scheduled me. The day came for them to come out and a lady named Stephanie left a message on my phone asking if they could move it up to 12:30,  but I was not available to take the call. When I checked my phone at about 1:20 I saw they left a message and when I got home at 1:25 they came and left already. Leaving a brochure behind.  I called and they got a little argumentative and weren't listening to what I was saying. I had to ask the lady to stop talking for a minute and allow me to explain because she insisted they had re-scheduled me for 12:30. I was finally allowed to explain that they blew it, because the lady (Stephanie) called and she no doubt gets paid by seeing appointments, but only left a message. Why send someone out to an empty house? I insisted that she  lied about confirming a new appointment with me. I did not feel good about that so I am not interested in hiring a company that starts off with a lie</text>

<Text>Window Design Group was HORRIBLE! At first, they seemed affordable & efficient, but I learned how they really worked throughout the process. The project started in early MAY and ended late September! They came out for numerous measurements, and the sizing was still wrong when they did the final installation. I had my current blinds in the property, and they failed to mention that they charge to remove those. During the final installation, they tried to charge extra for removal and dust clean-up!! Not impressed at all, and I will not use them again.<//Text><Time>1537388792787<//Time>< user_name>

<Response>None< /Response><review>AM REALLY SORRY I BOUGHT MY SHUTTERS FROM THIS COMPANY!!! Shutters look great from far, when you look up close you can see all the imperfections, chipped frame and chipped moldings.  I have called the customer service department since Sep. and nothing has been done.  The sales representative Kevin switch the crown molding for a Crest molding with out mentioning it to me. I have called him several times, sent him about 2-3 emails and no response!   Customer service states they will let him know and no one calls or does anything to help you out! Worth going with other companies even if you pay more!!!  I wouldn’t even give them one star but that’s the only way I could write this review< /review>< user>

they are real professionals. we called them for vinyl window replacement and they offered us the very best service and price. Called us back if we needed to talk to them heart to heart about payment or to learn more about what exactly they are doing.< /Review>

<date>1531671485701< /date><review>WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER and sadly from their VP Christopher Margott. Honestly I have not in the past been compelled to write a review but this experience left me so disappointed and reminded me price is not everything. I wanted to share to prevent others from making the same mistake. Sadly I went by my initial meeting with this VP. He was great friendly professional. Once I signed the contract it was over. Didn't deliver on time which I know can be expected sometimes but no callbacks, had to push multiple times to talk to the VP who sold the $8k+ product and when he was finally dragged to the phone he was unprofessional, extremely rude and condescending. He said and I quote "why do you need to talk to me, I pay customer service staff to do that." Wow! I urge you to not fall for the sales pitch that is the only  high rating they deserve. Wish I read their reviews prior I now know why the low average rating!</review>< name>

< Review>
The only part of the entire experience was meeting with Stephen Schofield who said he was son of one of the owners. He said this was a family owned company which I prefer to work with  vs. a corporation who has no interest in the customer.  I waited 4 months for my Plantation Shutters. I had to call them regularly to check on the status of my order since no one ever called me at all. The installer had my work order for over a week before attempting to contact me which I never received. I had to call to get a install date. When installation day came, I was given a window of 1:30-2:30 p.m.  with an estimated completion at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday. (This was fine, I had a graduation to attend at 3 p.m. but would arrive late)  At 1:45 p.m. I  started calling  Window Design Group since I had never received any kind of confirmation call on Friday regarding the Sat. installation from the installer...this took a total of 4 calls in which they only send a message to the installer without speaking to him...he finally called me at 3:30 p m to tell me he would be at my house in 45 minutes.  At 4:30 p.m. the installer arrived only to announce that he would be sitting in his truck taking his lunch break first?? The actual installation did not start till 5:25 pm, (3 hours later therefore  I was not going to the graduation).  The installation was finally done at 7:50 p.m.  The shutter louvers do not close completely to block out the light on several of them so there are random streams of light coming in on some of the shutters when they are completely closed. Then I am told that this is a corporation not a family owned business????  I as lied to from the beginning and we will see how these shutters hold up in time.... with all that I have dealt with I had asked to speak to one of the owners, only for Tanya to  tell me that  "she or Tony (the GM) are as high as you can go". the corporation runs remotely and would never call back a customer...so much for a family owned company and customer service!!!!  I had chosen this company over another company that was less expensive because it was family owned and that went out the window in the end.< /Review>

I decided to get my windows replaced as I live near a freeway and I was getting a lot of traffic noise pollution. Brandon came over and gave me a really affordable quote and so I installed new ones from him that were done well under time and matched his quote. Not only is there less noise, but they have made my apartment a lot cooler too, so I spend less on air conditioning.</Text>

We had Window Design Group install motorized shades for several tall and wide windows and French doors in our house a few months ago and we have been quite happy with our shades since installation. The project was not an easy one given a few technical matters which were not foreseen at the beginning.< /Text>

<Review>Horrible Service. Never on time. They get a form to sign before installation which says they are not responsible for damages caused during installation and they damage the walls around the windows. When we tell them about this they will show the paper we signed. I had to spend about $ 900.00 to fix the damages.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Thank you guys sooo much! I was having issue with my windows because they did not fit the actual frame and it's been bugging me literally, flies have been able to sneak their way into my house because of the shotty job whoever installed them did. I had a referral from a friend. Brandon came and did a free estimate so I knew exactly how much it would cost. So happy with the cost and the quality of work. The guys are super nice too. Thank you again!</text>

<review>TERRIBLE timeliness. We were told that our shutters would be installed in 4 - 6 weeks.  When 7 weeks came around we called to check up and were told it would be a little longer.  After 8 weeks they FINALLY came to install them and one of the windows was measured incorrectly.  Well, guess what... ?? We have to wait another FOUR TO SIX WEEKS.  These people have zero motivation to make us happy and really seem like they could care less.

We're looking at other companies for the rest of the windows in our house.

<gmap_id>0x80e82ec0aa16b5c7:0x282f1d2e432a1122<//gmap_id><Review>If you don’t mind paying in full weeks before the shutters are installed then this is the place. They charge you when you book the appointment not when you actually get them installed. If you don’t mind waiting 3 weeks for an appointment because they only have one guy in all of LA county who does measuring then this is the place. And if you have an important dr.’s appointment for the one and only time slot they offer you then you go out another 2 or three weeks or you get to reschedule the dr appt you’ve waited months for.  If you like waiting around for hours for the installer to show up then this the place. The Appointment was  between 10-12pm. At 12:10 I was notified that he couldn’t be there till 1:30 or 2pm and then would have to hang around another hour for the installation!
I had a local shutter installer that I got another quote from. I so wished I would have gone with them. So many companies to choose from. Save yourself the aggravation and take your business elsewhere!!!</Review>< Response>

<Text>I was nervous in dealing with contractors, but I found them locally online and the process was actually painless. My window shutters were made in about 10 days and installed quickly after. I'll upload my photo so you can see the finished work!</Text>< gmapID>

Worst customer service ever!!!
I had shutters installed in 3 bedrooms back in July. They are inside mounts and supposed to be directly on top of the window molding. i believe they were measured wrong because they don't look right (molding is sticking out here and there on 3 of them). i called their customer service and told them about this and they emailed me a link to their support website. I filled out a complaint and uploaded pictures of the shutters to their website. I received this email from them the day after  -
Mychael Margott (Window Design Group)
Jul 23, 1:23 PM PDT

Mr. Hamilton,

you will be hearing from our scheduling team today. We will be taking new measurements and we will be remaking the shutters that are not covering your molding properly. I am very sorry that this has happened. We will take 110% care of you moving forward on this.

Thank you so much,

Mychael
Window Design Group Support Staff

Their guy came over on July 28 and took measurements for replacement shutters. about 7 weeks later ( the installed shutters took 6 weeks to be made, so I thought I would be hearing from them) I sent emails asking for an update on my replacement shutters. No response. They have a number you can text so I texted them on Friday, Sept 7 asking for an update. Here's their response:
Hello James,
After reviewing the inspection report that Eli sent in, he stated that the install was complete & everything was fine. There is nothing stating for anything to be reordered. Can you please provide pictures of the product that you think needs to be repaired?

I  told them that I had an email from them saying shutters would be remade and everything would be taken care of. Their response was that they would review this matter with Myke and get back to me on Monday.
I text them on Tuesday saying it's Tuesday and I still have no idea when I'm getting replacement shutters. No response. I call them on Wednesday and Tanya says that the install was fine and if I could upload pictures of the shutters I thought were off. I uploaded pictures on their support website again that night and their response the next day was this:

Tanya Bramson (Window Design Group)

Hi Mr. Hamilton,

I have reviewed this with Mychael as well as Eli (the measure tech). The shutters are absolutely as they should be. I understand that you are frustrated and we never want that for any customer.
Window Design Group Support Staff

Here's the thing, the shutters are NOT as they should be! Do yourselves a favor and steer clear from this company, do a lot of research before using anyone. Google "Ca contractors license search" and use the Better Business Bureau and Yelp to look at complaints against a company. If I had done this with Window Design Group, I would have used someone else for sure. And if they think I am from a competitor trying to slander them, I'm not. I am ticket number 1434 on your support website. Communication with this company is a joke.</Review>

I have been having issues with my shades for over 1 1/2 years due to poor quality and workmanship. Appointments 2 to 3weeks out and they might not show up or they reschedule do to "parts have not arrived".
The worst customer service!

<Text>DO NOT DO TRANSACTION WITH THIS COMPANY. They hold you accountable for the contract you signed even if they are the ones not keeping up with the contract. The  worst experience I've had dealing with a company. The project MUST BE PAID IN FULL BEFORE YOU SEE ANYTHING. Like previous bad reviews, they have the worst customer service - no follow up, no return call, NO RESPONSIBLE PERSON RELIABLE TO TALK TO. I asked for the supervisor in charge  of the over all operation. They only have Tonya (Taunya), the manager who is quick to do service recovery, apologetic then promising unsatisfied customer like reimbursing the 50% of what you have paid for and will only collect full payment after work is done to your satisfaction. IT'S  A LIE!!!My contract promised a completion date of first week of May. June is halfway thru and nothing has materialized yet. UNLESS YOU CALL, YOU DON'T GET AN UPDATE. THE MANAGER IS ALWAYS BUSY, IS WITH ANITHER CUSTOMER OR OUT TO LUNCH.</Text></record>

<Text>October 25, 2014 - Chris came to my home for shutter measurements
November 8, 2014 - Tony came to my home for measurements ** it is their company policy to have two measurements taken**
December 17, 2014 -  I called to find out the status of my shutters and was informed "maybe after January 5th"
January 6, 2015 - I received a phone call from a technician stating he would be at home on January 7th at 8:30am to install my shutters. Well, that day didn't work for me I asked for a Saturday appointment and was informed by the technician that his schedule was full for the next 4 Saturday's
January 7, 2015 - I sent one of several emails to complain about the service and request a Saturday appointment
January 7, 2015 I received a phone call stating someone would be at my home on Jan 17 between 9am-10am
January 16, 2015 - I spoke with Tanya to confirm my appointment and receive the tech name and number. Tanya confirmed my appointment time however stated since their office was open on Saturday's till 2pm, I could call the office.
January 17, 2015 - at 10am no one had arrived at my home. I immediately called the office and Sherry informed me my appointment window was from 9am-11am. I asked her when did this change since I spoke with Tanya less than 24 hours to confirm the time. I was placed on hold several minutes for Tanya to get on the phone stating she made a mistake and the driver would be at my home at 3:00 or I could reschedule for another day. WHAT !!!! No thank you, I want my shutters today! The technician arrived at my home and I could immediately tell something was wrong, he looked around at all the windows and then said, " mam' I'm very sorry but I do not have all your shutters and the window in your master bedroom was measured incorrectly"

So, after TWO people coming to my home to take measurements, more than 2 MONTHS to make the shutters, this place cant get anything right. I have sent numerous emails, and not once has anyone from their management team contacted me.  Customer Service is not a priority for this company!< /Text><Name>Rhonda Simien< /Name><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I took a handful of bids for my project which included shutters for 7 windows and rolling shades for two sliders. While shutter products did not seems to vary greatly from company to company, pricing of bids and quality of salesmanship varied quite a bit. In the end, I was most impressed by WDG's salesperson Stephen S. and the quality of both the company's product and very competitive price.

I was a little concerned before installation because of some delay caused by the holidays and some sort of machine failure (see other reviews for similar tales of woe), but in the end the product was delivered and installed in a timely fashion.

Installation was a breeze -- right on time, professionally done, in and out. The shutters look great, too! We got the 50/50 split with hidden tilt on all 7 windows. They look and operate beautifully.

The rolling shades look great, but they are more see-through than we had hoped. The swatch held up to a window is a far cry from the whole shade being up. During the night you can see in and during the day you can see out (not so bad, kinda nice actually). We now are discussing cost-effective ways of working with WDG and their factory to get us new rolling shades in our master bedroom. I am hoping that goes well...

Overall, despite the terrible reviews I have seen on Yelp and Google, we are very pleased with WDG.< /Review>

<text>Don't be fooled by receiving a mailer in Orange County that this LA Based company measures up.

The salesperson came from LA which limited the times for an initial appointment.  I ordered the custom shutters for some windows (3) and (1) specialty window for my condo which they do not design or manufacture themselves.  The salesperson measured for the quote but a 3rd party installer (MTS) that is LA based (valley) calls you a few days after you paid the 50% deposit.   So you have to make another appt that may take weeks if you are only available on a Saturday.

It's more like 8-12 weeks (not 6-8) for the product (plantation shutters to arrive) which they charge you right away when they receive them.  Most businesses charge you the remaining amount when the work is completed and not hanging out in a warehouse. My Simonton windows and Lift Master garage door I purchased from 2 separate businesses charged a lesser deposit % (under 1/3rd) and didn't charge my credit card until after it was installed and I signed off on it.  Window Design Group charges you before they call you days later or in my case I called them.

The salesperson did not once follow up with me once regarding my order once I placed it in late Dec 2017.  I didn't get updates or was notified that my order was backlogged.  Each time I got an update was because I called Window Design Group myself.  I ordered my 4 plantation shutters and paid 50% for them in late Dec 2016 and only 3 were ready late February (8 weeks).  I scheduled a Saturday appt for the installation and their third party installers they were a "NO SHOW".  No call that morning, later that day nor the following Monday. It wasn't until once again that I called later that week that they admitted they had a glitch in their google calendar.

So after putting on the pressure to install they scheduled an appt for 2/12 weeks later as they do no do installations usually after 2 p.m. during the weekdays which I and likely most people work.  Frustrated about the lack of unprofessionalism and customer service I said I just wanted to cancel the entire order and they refused and said they wouldn't be able to refund my deposit. I asked to speak to someone in charge and they said it was the owner of the company and told me he would call me back...that never happened.  I asked if they could provide any discount for the late arrival of shutters, the shutters that still weren't ready (took 13 weeks not 6-8), and "no show" on a Saturday morning which I waited for a few hours and never got a call that day nor the following week until I called Window Design Group and they apologized and said they had a glitch in their Google calendar.

So they rescheduled me for 2 1/2 weeks later (on a weekend) and finally got only 3 of my 4 shutters installed (12/12 weeks after I ordered the standard plantation shutters).  By the way one of the shutters was warped and the installer didn't notice...and I had to point it out and he jotted down some info and I guess placed the order (which will be another future appointment)

So the specialty (small) plantation shutter arrived this week (took 13 weeks) and when I spoke to MTS to schedule they said they have limited (LA based) installers who work on Saturdays and only 1 was possibly available for the next few weeks/month .  So this could go on for another few weeks going on nearly 15 weeks or more.  Don't waste your time and money with Window Design Group as they don't design your plantation shutters and use a manufacturer out of state and use 3rd party installers so there's a major lack of communication and too many processes for the customer to work with and follow up with.  It's not a one man stop.
The shutter business is a dime a dozen and I believe any other business could probably do it a lot cheaper, faster and keep you posted as needed.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Disappointed with the service.  Initial consultation was promising.  However, when we started asking a lot of questions via email, response was slow.  During installation, the workers were late by several hours every single time.  We were told the installation of the doors would only take two days.  They broke the glass on one of the doors. A month later we are still trying to get this fixed. Meanwhile the molding around the doors remains unfinished.  The frustrating piece is the lack of communication.  I had to call them multiple times to get an update.  One time they called me, gave me an update and said they would call again the following week. They did not call.  After calling them again, I'm hopeful it will get completed at the end of this week.< /review>

<Review>We ordered 10 windows in January, and the project was finished in May.  THe biggest problem is communication between the different departments within window design group.

The day of install was delayed 2 weeks.  1 window was broken, and 2 were the wrong size.  The lead installer promised that 100% the 2 new windows would be here in 2 weeks.  After 2 weeks I called and the office FORGOT to order them.

Meanwhile I want the other 7 windows finished inside!  Twice the crew scheduled to come finish drywall, and did not show.  They were confused.  They were busy.  etc.

I had holes in my drywall and no drapes for 8 weeks while I waited for them to finish the project.

Worst of all, we needed these windows finished so we could restucco our house.  We couldn't wait an extra TWO MONTHS, so we had to stucco.  WIndow Design Group finished the project (finally) but the 3 late windows broke and cracked the new stucco during install.  WDG wanted to patch it.  No thanks. I'll have my stucco guy finish your work.

Our salesman (Stephan) said that the drywall around the windows would be paint ready.  But my husband and I had to sand and sand.  Drywall dust covered our whole house while we finished their work.

The windows are beautiful and well made.  So 1 star.  But please beware.  Our experience was horrible.</Review>< Pics>

LAUGHABLY bad customer service at every step. Took 6 months to get installed, of course not their fault, it's always someone else's fault. Now something broke and they supposedly have lifetime support, but its still over a month and 10 communication attempts to get it scheduled. Stay away, go to a real company< /Text>

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!  They don't deserve any stars!

Below is a summary of my nightmare with Window Design Group.  I engaged WDG in July 2015 based on a friend's recommendation.  I also interviewed 5 other vendors and thought Chris Margott (the salesperson) did a good job at pitching; however I have now waited 6 months for my plantation shutters when Chris said they would take approximately 4-6 weeks:

1) After 6 weeks of waiting, I called to inquired about my shutters and was told the louvers machine was broken and is waiting on a part from Germany.  The shutters were delayed an additional 5.5 weeks.
2) On the 1st installation date of 10/18/15, ALL of the shutters were incorrectly manufactured versus my purchase order (tilt stick versus no tilt, 30/70 dividers versus 50/50 dividers).  This error was across all shutter panels which led to the re-manufacturing of all panels that took another 12 weeks even though I was told it would be rushed.
3) On the 2nd installation date of 01/15/16, the shutters for three of the sliding doors were missing their "frames/boxes". The confusion was over whether the prior installer, who was fired by the company, had left them at my residence or not.  No one from WDG called me before hand to ask about this, which I could have told them nothing was left behind the first time.  This led to further delay of waiting on the re-order of the frames/boxes of 2+ weeks.
4) On the 3rd installation date of 01/30/16, the size of the shutter panels on the remaining sliding door shutters were incorrect and could not be installed.  The installer indicated that all remaining panels needed to be re-manufactured again before they can be correctly installed.  And he could not provide an estimate of time to re-manufacture the panels.

Through all of the delays, the customer service (or completely lack thereof) has and continues to be extremely unprofessional.  They do not respond to calls or emails.  Chris' assistant Tanya is completely incompetent and worthless, and her excessive use of "!" and smiley faces in emails is extremely unprofessional.  I have filed a complaint with BBB to no avail as WDG's response consist of only lies.

Please save yourself the heartache and DO NOT use WDG.</review>

Very bad experience
Ordered 7 window shutters, they told me it will take 5 to 7 weeks
It took 12 weeks and 3 out of the 7 came wrong because of their tech measured wrong
And after this they told me it will take another 7 weeks to fix it
Ended up receiving my shutters after 6 months
Not recommending dealing with them<//text>

I used to work at Scripps Hospital, Encinitas and always used to eat here. The food is fantastic. Since moving out of the area ever time I visit down south I always make the trip to eat here. It is that good and highly recommend to everyone. You will be hooked for life!</review>

<text>Like other reviewers, I've been coming here for over 20 years... since it was called 'Tokyo Teriyaki'. Its changed names about 4 times. The food was good then, and the food is 'meh' now. My kids love it and thats why we go.

Over the years the portions have gone way down and the prices have gone way up. I get it... its expensive to be in encinitas. But its rice and meat. COG's cant be more than .50 per plate and they are charging $13.

On top of that, they have the ubiquitous digital card reader that assumes you want to leave a tip.

Not all progress is good Surf Brothers. Please look at your vendors and your prices and remember where you started.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

If all you want is meat and rice this is the place for you! The chicken is good. Beef is so-so. I personally did not like the texture or flavor. They don't have any side dishes except for a salad/coleslaw. Their teriyaki sauce is good. Make sure you ask for extra!  Speaking for myself...I won't be back. :(
Side note...the staff is very friendly< /Review>

<Review>Great place. Have been going here since late 1990s when was called Teriyaki Brothers. Simple menu and delicious. I like to get the lite bite chicken or steak "opposite" (more coleslaw than rice), then mix it all together with a lot of their signature sauce and siracha.

I've been coming to this restaurant for  15 plus years, the entrees back then were about $8. Most recently ( as in maybe a month ago) the price for an entree with double meat was about $13 now the price has jumped to north of $17 ....

For this price I can eat a meal with an ocean view lol

How can you justify these prices?

Just showed up at your Encinitas location at 6:50 after checking the website that stated open till 8:00 on Sunday. The girl refuses to serve us and states they are closing early. There was another gentleman in there waiting for his food. When I state closing time is 8:00 she starts stammering about Father's Day. It seemed like she just wanted to get out of there. Either your website should have "holiday hours" posted or you should get some employees who want to do their job. We have had catering provided on three separate occasions but will not be returning to this location again.</text>

DELICIOUS! Really, Surf Brothers Teriyaki has delicious food and they are very quick. While food choices are pretty much limited to chicken, steak, or both, I think this is why their service is so quick and their food so good.</Review>

Don't miss this hidden gem, on the border of the Marina Peninsula beach. David Hockney's local gallery. Also, be sure to walk the neighborhood (Away from Venice boardwalk), and discover incredible wall murals and great architecture.<//review>

It was love at first sight: in 1979, as a young art student, I, like many others of my generation, were captivated by David Hockney’s supreme draughtsmanship and uncluttered painterly portals onto a cloudless Californian lifestyle.

But a lot has happened since then; Tracey Emin, digital photography, tablet devices, Creative Suite©, Instagram©, not to mention Barthes’ Camera Lucida - and a whole lot more. To place things into a proper perspective, over the past five decades, Hockney has always been an early adopter of new technologies, bringing both his sensibility and style to acrylic, Polaroid© and digital imaging by turns.

The shows at Annely Juda/L.A. Louver are based around what Hockney describes as ‘the void’ between the convention of perspective, the image surface and the viewer, and though his depiction of this perceptual disjunction may lack the poignancy of Barthes or the incisiveness of Sontag, it also comes with an understanding of the act of seeing along with an understanding of that act embodied in a practice which remains pointedly distinct from any other living artist.

Lest we forget: beyond the words and the technologies, Mr. Hockney still touches paint to canvas with a consummate brilliance that can only be sustained by the combined qualities of determination, practice and talent. This may of course be a statement of the blooming obvious, but even on a bad day, David Hockney remains one of the best painters England ever exported.

But beyond sentiment and back to the present, Hockney’s latest show is fascinating for a number of reasons; essentially he is attempting to unravel, on our behalf, the conventions of seeing, painting and photography that have become tangled through the convergence of digital and analogue image-making.

The typical portraits that comprise just less than half of the works in the show are apparently a foretaste of some 70 painted portraits that will be shown at major venues next year, and many of these are classic Hockney; stunning lines of brushwork against flattened slabs of intense colour. This juxtapositional use of paint has the effect of rendering the paintings expressive and expressionless at the same time. The portraits offer not only an insight into the artist’s vision, but also an incidental snapshot of his encounters with individuals in his social and professional orbit. Aesthetically and metaphorically, the deadpan Liquitex© flatness of Hockney’s painting is perfectly suited to the laconic depiction of his models and a sense, not of timelessness, but of subjects slipping into time.

In summary though, there is no implication here that this show is some kind of Curate’s Egg; it is altogether interesting, with never a dull moment, never a sense that the artist is recumbent on the laurels and always the sense that he is striving for more, for better, and driving hard to understand how human perception sits alongside the sensory extensions offered by technology. After spending an hour here, I just knew it wasn’t enough.<//text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) It depends on the exhibition.
The location is Venice, so it's easy to reach.

(Original)
展示次第ですね。

<Text>The workers here do NOT know what they are doing. My father went in after processing a new FREE line over the phone and all he needed was a new SIM card. They would not let him leave with out “activating” the SIM card not letting him know that they added an ADDITIONAL line to his plan. He was there for hours for nothing. Definitely avoid this store if you can. Even the customer service agent admitted that these workers do not know what they are doing. What a joke of a store.< /Text>< pictures>

I wasted gas coming here twice for phones that other stores informed me haven't been in stock for awhile. I called ahead of time and once I arrived, a rep claimed that they sold out the day before. I was also left on hold for a cool 20 min. And while I was there no one offered to order the phone for me which is well within their ability to do. I do not recommend this store. Other stores around town have better customer service.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Thieves! Robbers! And mainly scumbags. I went to get a phone that I wanted but instead tricked me into getting another phone. Great service T-Mobile is but the people here are liars.< /text>

Poor customer service from store rep. Sergio after my 4th Tmobile device all with broken charging ports  I take the phone into the California Ave store I show them the broken charge port and they said sure it's still under warranty they call the 611 number and order a replacement for 5 bucks no problem I ordered the phone to the Panama ln. Store as its closers to my house two days  later for to pick it up after removing my case and breaking the glass screen protector I was informed by Sergio that it would not be covered after the other store and  customer service told me it would be and sent a replacement this guy insist on not replacing the phone so after going back and forth Sergio will not assist me in anyway so I say I'm going to call customer service I step outside while on hold I get a text saying at my request they warranty phone has been refused and the replacement was canceled not ture I did not refuse finally I get ahold of customer service they say sure we will send you another one to your house since the store will not exchange it not to mention the store is always short handed and it takes about 30 to 40 minutes to get in and out beware of the so called warranties on T-Mobile devices<//text>

Had to go back 4 times for a phone that was but wasn’t there. We would receive calls from T-mobile telling us the phone was there but when we called that location to verify they would tell us it wasn’t there until the warranty cancelled and we had to order it again and pay additional fees< /Text>

Surprisingly this is the first review in over 30 years that we've been getting the best New York style 20 inch giant pizza. But we just got back from vacationing for a week supporting other restaurants so I wanted to write a review with pix and recognize their great customer service! On a busy Sunday afternoon with multiple sports on TV I called in for a delivery instead of just going through the Chownow app. The  manager of the day was John and got our order down perfectly... extra sauce no cut!
You would think it's no big deal but when you have a giant 20 inch pizza with extra sauce for delivery and you take a corner or turn at speed the sauce goes everywhere and slides off the pizza! But Oscar did a great job! Ever since the pandemic they wear a mask when delivering and it's contact free! Again thank you John and Oscar!< /text>

Ameci is a fantastic restaurant. They even gave my family a free pizza! The food was delicious. The garlic cheese bread is a must try. 🍕🍕🍕< /review>

The food is Very Good, The service is Poor and Even Rude. The Attitude is Not Appreciative of my business, in Fact, they could Not Care less. A Smile, and a friendly greeting would be So Refreshing. But No, just what do you want?  It will be ready in a few minutes.  That's IT, no thank you!</text>

My favorite local pizza joint. Service is always fast and friendly, and I’ve never had a bad meal from here. The pizza with meatball topping is worth checking out.< /Text>

Good food, but you can't get any deals online because they use "Slice" to do their online orders and 'Slice" doesn't have any of Ameci's coupons to use.  No point of ordering online from there.<//Review>

They have wonderful pasta dishes that go beyond spaghetti and meatballs. Cooked to order and large portion. Had the chicken Romano dish, very hearty. Had also medium cheese Pizza, thin crust with thick outer ring. The pizza does survive very well in the fridge for the following day. Their garlic bread is crispy and full of flavor in their seasoning. They have variety of sandwiches & desserts, not yet tried.

There is plenty of seating, free parking. The employees are very friendly and helpful. Totally recommended!<//text></record>

Great family friendly place to have lunch or dinner.  Personable service.  Great food.  Can't ask for better in a casual dining establishment!  Try the steak sandwich when you are not in the mood for the usual pizza or pasta fares.  It was surprisingly good.<//Review>

Just what a neighborhood pizza restaurant should be! Ameci Pizza is consistently tasty, with reasonable prices, and great customer service. Vinnie, the owner, makes an effort to know all his regular customers names, and always makes sure your experience there is great, whether eating in or taking it to go. They are popular for parties and fundraisers too.< /Text>

We ordered a pizza to be delivered and the delivery guy drove up to the house and sat in front of the house and never got out of the car. He claimed to have rung the doorbell and knocked but we were within 15 feet of the door and heard nothing. We have dogs and they would have barked. The store claimed they called 10 times, they did call my husband’s cell 4 times but he’d left it in the back of the house and didn’t hear it. We’ve ordered from them many times before but something has changed. So weird. It feels like we were being cased.  I refuse to order from these people again. There’s something odd going on there and it no longer feels safe to do business with them.</review>

Not a very friendly place for first timers.

Menu too complicated to navigate through, and the owner seemed very impatient when we took our time to order.

Should've ordered a pizza, that's on me, but the sandwich is quite underwhelming for what it cost.

9 dollars for this? No thank you.</review>

Worst delivery service time and time again. If Papa Johns wasn't racist, we would order from there but instead were stuck with this heart burn inducing attrocity of a pizza. Ordered deliver and it took over an hour and a half to get our order, at opening on a Monday. That's not peak time. That's not the super bowl. Extremely disappointing. Call backs kept telling us the driver just left but our food never got here. When it did it was cold, dry and hard. Disapponting.< /Text>

Pizza is great but the sub I just got from my order is soggy and they put like 2 thin thin slices of salami on it. More ham than anything but not much. I expected an Italian sub to be toasted but that’s my bad. Soggy bread is not though. And we picked the order up right away too.< /review>

I've always found the customer service great here. The food is very good and their manager is very nice whenever I come in. I once had an issue being double charged but it was dealt with quickly and they were very polite and apologetic about the whole thing. Would recommend highly.< /text>

<text>This place used to be good.  Not impressed by service. Food quality WAY down. I ordered a Italian a turkey and a tuna. I ended up  with 2 jam and one baloney  sandwich. Seems to be the trend. I hope they get it together  since they are in the neighborhood.</text>< name>

<Review>I will never order from this establishment again. I called and ordered a specific 16" cheese pie. When we got our order it was a 14". I called back and told them the mix up and the man that answered the phone would not send out a 16" because he said we paid for a 14". When we suggested he charge the extra and send a 16" he said nothing on the phone and when we repeated the question he said there was nothing he could do.
I myself spent 7 years working in a pizza shop and if someone got an order that they didn't ask for (specially a frequent customer) we would always correct it for them.

We have been customers of Ameci's for many years and have always had excellent food and service. Vinnie always goes out of his way to make sure his customers are happy and satisfied.  Whether you are looking for a fun family restaurant or a delicious pizza delivered to your door Ameci's is one of the best in T.O.</Review>

All the standards, plus a nice selection of local and in-house products. Surprisingly impressive fresh fish counter - better than what you'd find at the giant chains. Interior of the store is a bit retro, but that doesn't detract from the shopping experience. Staff comes off as genuine.< /Review>

<Name>Laura K.< /Name><review>Love Spencer's. Our favorite market in morro bay. They host the best farmer's market ever. We come back everytime we are in the area. The best navel oranges on the planet. Excellent tamales and salsa. Get there early for homemade bread and soup because it sells out fast! Outstanding produce. Friendly vendors. Highly recommended. Thanks for being there.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80ece1ad1e1b423b:0x3474c700e771c7b0<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

A grocery store trapped in the 1980s. I'm not expecting upscale merchandise from a place like this but after looking around and not seeing anything organic, and somewhat barren shelves and little to no options for vegetarians in the way of protein (unless you count beans or the one kind of boca patty they had) I almost walked out. Purchased some ground beef here and had to throw it out, has most likely it had been through the grinder a couple of times. Staff was helpful, parking was easy go here if you need chips or beer but don't come here to shop for your week's groceries.<//Text>

It's about time this place FINALLY had some upgrades!  New, high-end refrigeration cases are everywhere, making for an exceptional shopping experience.  Just the upgraded produce section, deli counter, meat department, and cheese islands alone place this a cut above the nearest competitor.  Granted, in some areas more variety would be a good thing,, but with ocean views at checkout, there now is no reason whatsoever to shop elsewhere.  Thank you for being there!<//Review>

Staff was friendly!  Carts (that are very nice and new with a unique comfortable wide grip handle)...are expected to be self sanitized with gel hand sanitizer and a roll of paper towles(that keeps falling on the floor because it doesn't fit the dispenser)..to make your cart "wipe". Stand was hard to find, kinda hidden by the plants near the door. Dates on products were good, but a lot of items were quite dusty.  I found this to be quite a bit more expensive than other grocery stores. I got the one item I needed there, and finished my shopping elsewhere.<//Text>

The store reminds me of a village market when I was a kid...you step inside and the first thing that hits you is that mouth drooling, wonderful smell of roasted chicken.  The produce is great and the employees friendly?< /text>

<review>Meat, #1 reason to come here. One of the last old fashion markets with real butchers cutting, craving, beef, and making sausages right in front of you. Prime cut steaks, big variety of delicious sausages, great pork, and poultry options. Good produce department.  Check out their home made salsas, and jars of pickled vegetables. Good deli, with fried chicken.
* Shoppers helpful hint. At their Morro Bay Market on Thursdays at 2:30 there is a big local farmers market in the parking lot.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80ece1ad1e1b423b:0x3474c700e771c7b0<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They got some killer spencers brand name salsa in tubs I adore In the produce section. Its not quite as covid freaky as Albertsons. Has a good selection. Nice staff. Very convenient. Deli counter. Coffee grinder if they haven't taken it out like Albertsons last time i noticed it was still there. Like this little place my between store store.</Text>

<text>I absolutely love this place.  The best meat market and home made sausage on the Central Coast.  The cashiers are friendly and they hire handicapped young people that really make my day when I go in.  We get over here as often as possible and I purposely wait to buy groceries so I can go to Spencers....Thursday is farmers market day so be sure to get in on that too.</text>< Pictures>

Good old Spencer's grocery store. Central Coast for quite a while now we love coming getting groceries from the store. Lots of local products inside. Highly recommend stopping by the butcher chatting them up and ask him about the deals the day. Looking for a quick bite to eat stop by there Deli very friendly<//Text>

We also found a peppered salami that was so good we went back to get a second package before continuing our trip...Never found it any place else...

Excellent location! If you're staying in the Morro Bay Area you must come here for you grocery needs. Much cheaper than eating out all the time. We stop by to grab  Essentials like bagels cream cheese Mayo Deli products and some household products. Very pricey, so be on the lookout for the prices. Try to bring your Necessities with you on the trip if can. They have an excellent Bakery area with fresh breads and fresh deli. The staff is friendly.</text>

Usually not as crowed, friendly staff and they recently did some remodeling so its much nicer and cleaner than it was before. I think they have a great selection of meats here. Most of it comes from Harris Ranch farms, the steaks here are BBQ perfection. The produce is usually good. They also make good sandwiches made with my favourite lunchmeat Boars head. I highly recommend this place for a grocery run.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Spencer's a good local store and I'd much rather spend my money there then give it to a chain like Albertsons in Morro Bay. The staff were friendly so some of them room kids and not very helpful when it comes to some ingredients needed for dishes. But I understand why the business has to hire them. They'll work cheap and they are nice kids. All in all a pretty good store.<//Text>

<text>Sometime it's difficult to find what you need at the name brand stores and thankfully that is why we have this wonderful market.  I was looking for a specialty cut of meat and they had no problem getting it for me.  The other stores in the area said no.   Not only were the employees very friendly, but they were curious about how it was being used which was nice.  On top of Spencer's always being a reliable market their prices are usually very reasonable if not good.  They are a great local company to have.

Don't forget to check out the great Farmer's Market they host every Thursday also!< /text>< pictures>

I'd give 5 stars if they could keep the shelves stocked with their best sellers! Also,  staff is always super courteous and friendly.</review>

Such a nice, local feel to this place.  Got my Diestel turkey and all the accoutrements!  Also, all those locally made pickles and salsas and jams are excellent.  The pickles remind me of my grandma's pickles in Illinois so many years ago.  Forget the big chains, go to Spencer's.<//Text>

<date>1546493158833</date><rate>1< /rate><Text>Had a experience tonight that I hate to review but feel I need too. I saw a sale item so I grabbed a few. As I was being rung up I realized the items rang up full price. The cashier went to go check the item and then they came back and apologize told my the sale tag was under the wrong item then  acknowledged it was a co workers fault but didn’t offer to override the items price. This issue needs to be addressed with all workers as if the items is priced wrong can be misleading as most sale items are pretty easy to read and in the right place. Please fix this.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

They had a surprising choice of vegetables. I went in looking for Daikon radish and not only did they have them there was also sprouts, bok choy and nappa cabbage. This is located in a tourist area. I was hoping to get a nap in before heading out as I'd been driving for a long ng time but there's towing signs everywhere so that was disappointing.<//review>

The deli at Spencer's is fantastic.  The service personnel are ready and will to fill your requests.  Boars Head meats and cheeses are the best.  the take out fried chicken is better than you can make at home.  Coleslaw , marinated mushrooms, Santa Maria macaroni salad are favorites..Try it you will lkie it<//review>

I'm not big on going to the store and avoid Albertsons at all costs. Lol Spencer's is hardly ever busy if they are then they open a new lane.  Not necessary cause the checkers are fast. Easy in and out. They have an ATM If needed.</review>

One of the better grocery stores in the area. Best big one in Morro Bay for sure. If nothing else, go just for the meat section, the selection and quality is top notch.<//Review>

Good meats.  Excellent produce.  Lots of help and a great Deli with excellent meats and awesome sandwiches.  I looked in 4 other stores to find ingredients for a special recipie.  When I got to Spencers they had them all and the 2 I had purchased elsewhere were less expensive too.</Review>

Last choice supermarket if you are stuck in North MB.  Some of the employees have been working here for im guessing the past 25 years.. and it shows.  Having said that, they do have some good deals at times -- just watch those expirations dates haha!</Review>

If you want to spend way too much for stuff you can get at Dollar tree, only to be condescended to by the 12 year olds working there, this is the place for you! Go after hours and you can at least get your money back by getting stuff out by the Goodwill donation trailer.< /Text>
