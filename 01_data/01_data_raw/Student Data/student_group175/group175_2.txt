I have come here a few times with a friend of mine when we are in the area.

Its a blue building...you order outside and pick up outside...no indoor seating.

This time I ordered a small tripple berry sundae...3.99...vanilla ice cream...topped with like a berry compote which was really good ...whipped cram...chopped peanuts and a cherry on top...i very much enjoyed it...very refreshing.

he ordered a medium strawberry shake...4.31. He said he really enjoyed it.

They also sell food such as hotdogs...burgers...pastrami burger...grilled cheese...shrimp in chips...fries...onion rings...corn dogs...as well as other ice cream treats like soft serve cones or dipped cones...blizzards...eat.

I like this place a lot...<//text>

<Review>Just went for soft ice cream. Didn't have chocolate. So had the dipped cone. Can't drive and eat the chocolate shell at the same time. It cut the craving for sweets.< /Review>< time>

Was on my way to do some laundry and desperately needed to break a 20 just into some 5’s or ones. I asked really nicely and the kid rudely said he couldn’t give me change and looked at me like I was a crazy person trying to scam him or something. So much for helping out your local neighbors. I was excited to try that place out while I was doing laundry right next door but forget it now!!</Review>

We ordered a caramel sundae, a chocolate soft serve in a cup and a cone. Lady gave us 2 cones and a vanilla soft serve with chocolate sauce. She refused to give us what we originally ordered and yelled at us for wanting her to give us what we ordered.<//review>

This is one of the most disgusting places I’ve ever been to. I ordered a burger combo and the soda was completely flat and the ranch dressing was literally chunky. And they charged me for it!

Y’all. DO NOT GO HERE. I’m a little worried I might have contracted food poisoning. Pray for me.< /Text>

Heard a lot of hype about this place, so we decided to try it.

We got the cookies & cream ice cream sandwich, marble ice cream sandwich, mint chocolate chip shake, and a slice blue velvet cake.

I practically ate both the ice cream sandwiches by myself. So good mmmMmmmmm.......

The cake was good.

The shake was really good.</Text>

< review>
We did not have a great experience at Fosters Freeze. There was only one woman working, so we waited in line for 10 minutes to place our order. In that time we watched the woman yell at two different customers for not understanding what she was asking. She was rude to us when we ordered, commenting on how it was inconvenient of us to change a small to a medium. We then had to wait 20 minutes for our orders. Mine was made incorrectly (coffee ice cream instead of chocolate) and my partner's milkshake was almost all ice. It was like a slushie. We were both frustrated by that point and didn't want to deal with the poor customer service so we just left. We will not be going back.<//review>

I was the only person in line and no one was waiting for their food. He forgot the BACON! The lettuce seemed old and withered...The tomatoes were as if they had been cut a week ago. Bummer, I love this place. It is definitely gone downhill.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Waited 15 minutes to order them spent 15 minutes waiting for it be done. I ask simply for a PLAIN hamburger and a vanilla cone. What do I get? Cheese burger with everything on it. Now I understand with fast food sometimes the employees are working so fast they’re on autopilot. But with a wait time approaching a restaurant, that clearly isn’t the problem. If you fast food or good food or even what you order, don’t come here. Especially if you’re on a budget.</Text>

<review>It's sort of like an old Dairy Queen, featuring mediocre fast food (that isn't served particularly fast) and ice cream-centric treats. None of it will blow you away, and while this isn't a bad option on a hot day, there's absolutely no reason to go out of your way to visit this shack.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

About a week ago, my boyfriend and I stopped by for dessert. He ordered a rocky road shake, knowing that they typically contain almonds or walnuts. However, this location uses peanuts instead and does not disclose this information. When he asked them of his ice cream had peanuts in it, as he is allergic to them, the women working there were insanely rude and refused to think that information should be disclosed.</review>

Went to check on some Maybelline. Got distracted by a fried burrito, I'm not saying it's their fault... But next time I'll save room for an ice cream. Old school West Berkeley... Hope it never gets bulldozed for a fly by night tapas shop. Let's stand by this icon. Por favor.< /text>

Went there not thinking I was hungry and just had a major argument with beau... After getting a hamburger combo with fries and soda, the fries are perfectly fries are every single fry (saved some for later after my belly relaxed, the fries were still better than the McD's that only taste good when hot) hamburger could have used more seasoning and more sauce, but the fries made up for that and an ice cold Coca-Cola to hit the spot!
Definitely a go back place! And the you by last that works there all the time do3s wonderful as well.
Keep up the good work Foster Freze on University Ave in Berkeley<//Text>

<review>I maybe could give it 5 stars but it was a tad expensive for burger and fries and chili cheese fries, but then again SUPER ample, super delicious, and VERY filling (1 order of chili cheese fries filled up my boyfriend and I.) Plus super sizing it probably didn't help the price to stay low. Nice selection of shakes. I love that it was open late enough. Plenty of parking.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Take-away only, there is not seating or indoor area. Medium sized parking lot; there are usually places to park. Vegetarian options on the food menu, and lots of soft-serve dessert items.

Laundromat in the same parking lot makes for a great laundry experience.<//Review>

<Review>That frosty cone nearly knocked off my phoney mustache disguise.
And that grease spot from that cheeseburger is going to be Exhibit.A in my diet trial.
So I will just plead now to using the subterfuge of stopping by to get something for the kids to indulge my own wanton desires.
"Would you like that chocolate dipped?"
Oh heck yeah.

< Review>
This is an ice cream place. Don't come here for anything other the ice cream if you don't want to be disappointed...

The banana shake that I got was amazing. The fries were gritty OreIda fries I remember from my childhood but not in a good way. My man was maaaad that they put mayo on top and bottom bun and the lettuce and tomato on bottom of his chicken sandwich. The sandwich fell apart super fast and he was so uneasy from the amount of mayo on it. For $20, I was super let down.</Review>

Simple, roadside grill and ice cream.  A bit of a shadow of it's glory days, and lower quality than the hipster places that abound, but still tasty when you're in the mood for old school.<//review>

Way too expensive compared to other Foster Freeze, on top of that they don't except anything other than cash, and nothing over $20. A smile with the service would've made the experience a bit more favorable too. Lol<//Review>

How can a restaurant be that SLOW and get the order so WRONG? Let me tell you how. A, the cashier taking in orders speaks broken English and doesnt quite understand normal English. On top of that she rushes through the order process. She didnt listen to a word I said. How hard is it to understand No sause No tomatoes? I haf to repeat myself 5 times. All i wanted was a #2 with a pepsi. I got the #2 but not how i wanted it. Took almost 25 minutes to get the 1st order. Wrong. Then another 15 for the right order, so i thought. Turns out i didnt get half my order. Thanks for stealing my money foster freeze. Never again will i go there. Learn English and dont steal from customers. Its impossible to give 0 stars. Thats what you deserve.</Text>

I went on for a simple battery replacement. I paid the fees up front and have nothing but regrets since I walked in the door. No one notifies you if parts come in. No one returns your call or messages. They don't honor their commitments for services rendered. Four weeks after initial contact and I still don't have a phone that functions properly. I will never return or will I reccomend their service to anyone.<//review>

One of the workers, Garrett was very friendly and helped me diagnose and figure out my phones problem. The prices are cheap for my iphone repairs and seemed very worth it for me. Would definitely recommend versus more expensive places, not to mention a 90 day warranty for the parts they replaced!</text>

Chris and Sylas were super helpful and nice guys! Took the time to explain and listen to my issue. Knowledgeable and good prices, I would recommend. Thanks guys!

Update... my new batterie that was replaced has expanded and now my phone looks likes it’s exploding. I’ll have to take this back in to get it changed.

** Update 2. Batterie covered under warranty. Quick service. Awesome.<//text>

<Review>Came in to get my screen fixed on my phone because I had it previously repaired by a different  repair shop and they used really low quality parts the screen eventually blacked out to the point where I couldn’t use the phone. After I brought it in they  used their screen it worked perfect and it looked like it did when I first bought the phone. Dope service , great customer service, definitely coming back if I need them again ..</Review>< Pictures>

As a return customer I was delighted to see that the service here was still as quick, professional, and courteous as it was the last time I came in.

<Date>1530978762873< /Date><text>I stared having issues with my phone not wanting to take a charge and I do a lot of business on my phone so I needed it fixed as soon as possible. I seen that they fix iPhones passing by the building so I figured id give them a shot. and I'm glad I did because they were able to diagnose the problem and resolve the issue very quickly. I was able to wait in their waiting room and watch some tv while they fixed me up.</text>< resp>

I was there at 3:27 PM and they close at 4. They were already walking out the door when I pulled up. What I needed would have only taken a few minutes. If your open until 4 PM your employee should be there as well.<//Text>

<Text>This is a nice quiet place to stay.  The staff is very friendly, personable and professional. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because all the rooms with Queen size beds are on the second floor.  I'm not good with stairs therefore I was forced to pay $5 extra rach night for a king bed.<//Text>< name>

<Review>Really laid back place with all you need in the room or nearby. I was able to get a room during fire evacuations and the front desk clerk was so kind when I kept switching around checkout dates. All the staff members I encountered were polite and friendly. It was really great to have an exterior hallway and unit A/C so I didn't feel I was breathing in COVID.. I could see my car from my window and access it easily. Other guests were very laid back and friendly too. Thank you!</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Rooms were decent at best. Empty vending machines (completely). Small rooms, noisy fans and light fixtures. Way overpriced. Friendly front desk Assoc. Cup of q-tips and cotton balls. Not very sanitary. Only stayed about 5 hours.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Room had stained furniture, burn marks on table, dated and unclean. Balcony had what looked like old blood stains.  The lady at the front desk was very nice. Its unfortunate that she didnt represent what the room would look like.<//Review></record>

< Review>
we were in area for my husbands surgery at Stanford. I was by myself for a couple days and one night. I felt perfectly safe as the attentive young lady who worked the front desk put me close to lobby. I appreciated this as I was apprehensive to be in a strange town and under this stressful circumstance. Everything was neat and clean. They went out of their way to follow the Covid rules. Thank you so much.</Review>

Nilda is awesome in the customer service department. She went above and beyond for us. We had driven many hours and she did her very best to make us comfortable and protected. Corporate department at Comfort Inn needs to take notice of Nilda. She is truly an ambassador for Comfort Inn. I highly recommend this establishment, it is clean and the price is right but Nilda makes the difference between this place and the one down the street. Thank you Nilda.</text>

Negative: The outside areas were very dirty. Very off putting. I understand its low end and the cost etc. but someone could dust the stair well for cob webs. Also the furniture in the room was old and scrathced, very worn.< /review>

Took my late father to an appointment with a specialist at Standford Medical Center. We stayed at this hotel due to its location, price, and the reputation of the chain it belongs to. His appointment day came and he was seen by the doctor at Standard University Medical Center who cleared him to go home at about noon. We returned to the hotel and dad was in pain and did not want to spend another night on the road and just wanted to go home to the Fresno area. We attempted to check out of the location just 15min after final checkout time and were rudely told we could not. Both myself and my mother attempted to reason with the front desk manager but could not make any progress. We ended up giving them the room key and departing for home while paying over $100 for a extra night we did not use. He was a retired USAF Veteran with full VA Disability and they treated us this way. Never stay here.< /Text>

Negative: It was terrible. The room was dirty and had to be cleaned again stains on the pillowcases sheets had to be changed. I was charged an extra $30 because they have no queen beds on the first floor they are only king so I had to pay for a king room.</text>

<rating>2<//rating><review>This hotel is in desperate need of a refresh/update.  However, besides the dirty carpet, furniture, and torn wallpaper.  Let me just say that the shower was horrible.  Where's the water pressure?  A hot shower with good water pressure is a necessity for me.  Water was hot, the pressure was pitiful.   Oh, and then there was the mold on the wall.  I will probably not be back.  Ceilings were thin and could hear the person above walking around.< /review></record>

The staff was excellent when checking in.  The hotel is very clean.  There is enough space in the parking lot so you can park close to your room.  I left before breakfast so I cannot evaluate it.  They gave me one of the two rooms they upgraded.  They were trying to decide which style they should use.  Not having seen the other room, I cannot contrast them.

This brand is my preferred hotel chain.  I've always had great service and rooms.  The staff is courteous and helpful.<//review>

Close to VA hospital where husband had surgery. Clerk that checked me in was very nice and polite. Other employees were also nice. Breakfast was good. Room was dated, but sufficient and clean. Carpet had just been shampooed, so it was wet. The room had a distinct odor from the carpet being cleaned I  think. I left the windows open till 11pm to air out.The wallpaper was pealing off in several places. The bed was comfortable and so were the pillows. I did have a problem with the toilet. It wouldn't flush right, so it clogged up. I did like the fact that there was a microwave and fridge and had a first floor room. Also there was convenient shopping all along El Camino Real where I am familiar with from coming here for several years for my husbands checkups. Otherwise my stay here was  good. I would stay here again.< /text>

< review>
I booked this room over a month ago because I have a doctor's appointment at Stanford Medical Center and I live in the San Joaquin Valley. When I made the reservations, it was my understanding that I can pay for the room upon arrival and secure the room with just a credit card Deposit. They call me the day before my arrival and tell me that the room has to be paid in full on the credit card prior to my arrival. This is contrary to what was advertised and I'm extremely upset about this. Avoid this motel at all cost.<//review>

This last visit was atrocious.  The curtains in the room were ripped. The carpet was stained. The place looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. When my sister complained about the situation, she was told that there are other places to stay in Palo Alto.  I promptly made a reservation through Airbnb for the Stanford Hotel. Not only was it closer to the Hospital, but it was much larger and much nicer. Hardwood floors throughout. Clean as a whistle. We will NEVER be back to the Comfortless Inn.

Comfort Inn was worth staying at. It was nice and accommodating, except for the night time desk clerk.  He was useless for information. He actually told us "there are no grocery stores in the area." When in fact we found a whole shopping center 2 miles up El Camino. He admitted "this is not my real job, it's just where I  come to get $.< /review>

This was the cheapest place we could find a couple days in advance, and although the room was very clean. wallpaper was peeling and the rooms are very small. The breakfast is minimal and the eating area is very tight. Unpleasant if the are more that 10 people there. At least they don't charge for parking. Staff was pleasant.</Review>

<Review>The management changed our reservation without notice and claimed he had received our permission to change our reservation from a room with two queen beds to a room with only one king bed.  The clerk was sympathetic but could not provide a room that we had reserved.  The only action he was able to take was to send us to another Choice hotel 15 miles away, at a busy Friday night at about 9 pm.<//Review>< pics>

I just wished my hotel key had worked, instead of not working in and out of room.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><name>Anonymous< /name><response>None<//response>< userid>

1. It's conveniently located
2. Rooms are clean and have basic amenities shown on their website
3.  Staff though courteous they keep referring queries to their manager
4.  Also there seem to be a lot of disconnect between the property team and the central choice team. Eg. Out of the blue I was told that city tax is increased by 1.5percent..on asking why I wasn't informed upfront they said they didn't know it.  Such city changes don't happen overnight... They finally adjusted this amount, but communication gap is clearly visible.
5. Breakfast is good. Though menu remains exactly the same all days they have a decent spread much Better than the grab and go bfast options in this area.
6. My Visa forex credit card didn't work at their place and the reason given was their payment gateway doesn't accept it.  .this same card  works all through america...I had to pay by cash....that's quite some inconvenience and the team need to really sort it out with most out of country travellers adopting the  forex card
Overall decent place. Clean and good for a shirt stay< /review>

We have stayed here a few times. Our room was clean and the location is reasonably quiet. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The motel is within suitable distance to Stanford Hospital & medical offices/clinics. The beds are comfortable. The rooms are in need of updating and renovation.</Review>

Positive: Friendly front desk staff, soft plentiful pillows. Great location and great price Negative: Mildew on the bathroom walls.Gross looking giant teddy bear in the front thrown in the bushes across from the office that I swore moved each night..  Also the power went out on the whole block but would've been nice to have offered a flashlight or credit.<//Text>

<Text>From the outside this looks like your run of the mill Comfort Inn but once checked into your room it becomes a bad experience.  My room had a very stale oder and grimy feel.  There was mold on the tile grout and rust on the mirror.  The refrigerator hummed all night.  They provide a hot breakfast but it was not edible and the coffee is very weak.  Employees don't smile and they seem to be very unhappy.  I couldn't wait to check out.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808fba62028d118d:0x6f31c15be66eff25< /Gmap_id></record>

Great location near tech centers, some resturants within walking distance. Quiet even though on a main street. Common areas and room decor a bit shabby, but super clean and comfortable. Staff is great. Other than a hot breakfast, no amenities, but this is reflected in a rate being lower than the surrounding properties. Recommend!< /Text>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I usually swear by Comfort Inn, stay in them 10x per year all over the country.  This one is a dump.  Facility is old, furnishings are worn and some broken:  desk chair lift, shower valve handle, wall socket by the bed as some examples.  Water pressure was excruciatingly low, something like an RV shower.  Rate varied $170 - $260 per night over Sunday - Wednesday.  This place has only one thing going for it:  proximity to Stanford.<//Text>< user_id>

<review>We are an elderly couple and were given almost the very last room at the farthest end away from the lobby.  We had to carry our luggage upstairs and a great distance from the nearest parking space.  Hotel staff should pay attention to the needs of older people.  In addition, our phone didn't work so we had to walk all the way back to the lobby (3 times) to remind the staff about the phone.  The room itself was relatively clean except for the really dirty carpet and the mold around the tub.  There were cracks in the bathroom floor and a broken toilet tank lid taped together with strapping tape.  Obviously needs some maintenance.  The breakfast, however, was quite nice and really appreciated having a microwave, coffee maker and refrigerator in the room.   I tried to post pictures but for some reason they are not showing up in my review.  :-(<//review>< Pictures>

The internet access/broadband was terrible to the point of being non-existent. Location and building structure prevented me from getting decent cell service, so I was dependent on the WiFi which didnt work. The front desk reset their main router several times and I even worked with their remote IT person to no avail.<//Text>

I met a bunch of old college friends to see the Washington State vs. Stanford football game recently and they selected this hotel.  It ended up being an excellent choice!  Convenient location - places to eat nearby; stadium not too far away.  The price was far less than the more "upscale" places, but the Comfort Inn was very clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, the breakfast was simple but tasty.  I'd definitely recommend it.  Worked well for what we were looking for.</text>

I was charged for pillows they said I took. Funny thing is that I got charged before I left the room. Cleaning lady was next door, I'm guessing she got the rooms confused. I spoke to the manager a few times but she never got back to me. Didn't really cared about the money but the fact that they just assumed I took pillows bothers me.</Review>

Ok for a hotel in this class, but the room card-key readers sorely need replacing (had to get replacement keys and swipe about 40 times to open the door). No signage or information in the room - I had to ask - twice - to find the ice machine. Comfortable bed, nice larger refrigerator. Good bathroom.</Text>

Comfort Inn, Palo Alto, California is not up to the standards I have seen at other Comfort Inns.  The beds are still wonderful, comfortable and clean.  But the room was small, with no real closet; just a small wooden cupboard for clothes.  Bathroom amenities more what I would expect at a Super 8.  Breakfast not so good either--it did have a waffle maker and eggs and bacon, but no nice muffins or rolls, and the only fruit I was was a bowl of oranges.  The coffee was so bad it was almost undrinkable.  Desk person not very helpful.</review>

Great location. The issues were the bathroom had yellowing all over the walls, what looked like mold in the grout, bathroom ceiling seemed water damaged, also our front door had a massive gap so could hear people walk by. A/c worked either way too well or barely worked. Breakfast has to be eaten in your room as no table or seating in the area for breakfast. Staff was just meh. They seemed to be just there and that is it. Didn't show any cares. Only good thing was a good price, otherwise don't stay here.< /Review>

What I liked about this hotel is that they are pet friendly and did not charge an arm and a leg for pet deposit! Everything went great for a 1 night stay! So far so good!<//review>

Good place to stay. Not all the rooms are as I described, I've stayed here before and had no problems. The place is pretty quiet. I will stay here again.< /text>

Pretty good two star, very polite front desk.  Housekeeping and location a weak point, a little bit far from things.  Yes, I would stay there again.</text>

The Comfort Inn is clean and comfortable (pillows are great).  The staff is friendly. Breakfast was fabulous (bagels, waffles, toast, cereals, muffins) and drinks. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Palo Alto area. It's a bit older, but great for the price.<//text>

<text>Our room was away from the street noise (which was requested), but it was, in a word, awful. Bad soft lumpy bed, bad smell, tattered, stained dirty drapes and carpet, flimsy bedding, broken sink drain, only a handheld shower in the bathroom- no overhead shower!!  Refrigerator had no adjustment so it froze food. Mildew in the shower tile. 
Parking spaces were narrow and the lot was difficult to navigate. Breakfast area shared the same counter as the checkin desk with only 4seats available (no tables) just a small couch and 2 side chairs. The hall lights were off the night when we returned around 10 pm. 
The staff was indifferent and made no effort to satisfy our complaints.</text><time>1555459200000</time><Gmap_id>0x808fba62028d118d:0x6f31c15be66eff25< /Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Convenient stay.  I really don’t have anything else to say.  It was convenient, clean and the staff was pleasant.  Breakfast filled the bill.  Picked up an instant cocoa for dinner after the football game and it was perfect as I did not want to go out to eat after dark as a “seasoned “ woman.</review>

<Text>We were in the area because of a family member's surgery at Stanford. This Comfort Inn was near by, allowing us to stay at the hospital all day, and find our way back to our room fairly well. It is situated on a good road, with many choices for food or supplies along the road. We were greeted by very friendly hotel staff, had a good choice of breakfast food to either eat in the dining area or take with us to the hospital to tide us over on our long stay during surgery and recovery. The room was clean and quiet. Parking free and room was not expensive, which is great when you are only using the room for sleep and refreshing for the next day. The room had a small refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave, allowing us to purchase small items for dinner or using leftovers from lunch if we wished.<//Text>< rating>

Hotel staff was cordial. Breakfast was very good. Room was very clean but the traffic was noisey (our room was facing the busy street). The neighborhood looked a little sketchy but safe enough. $244 per night (on a Wednesday)???</text>

We got a great room in the back which was by some grass so we didn't have to go far to walk our dog. They also provided bags for pet waste. The beds were very comfortable too and the breakfast was really tasty and filling. I highly reccomend staying there if you can afford the price.<//text>< user_id>

Disgusting🤮🚬🚬, way overpriced. The room smelled so strong of cigarette, not healthy especially if you’re staying with children. They charged us for smoking thought we don’t smoke. Terrible and wouldn’t recommend at all, plenty other motels to choose. I’d give it zero stars.</review>

Was trying to conserve budget while Palo Alto hotels tend to jack prices up for business travelers during the week.  Was resigned to the "lower end" of the hotel chains but was very pleasantly surprised at the experience.  Clean, comfortable and friendly.< /review>

The rooms were poorly maintained. I was given a room and before unpacking realized the wall unit AC/Heat was not working. I was moved to another room where:
The toilet didn't flush, the refrigerator froze items (no control dial) and the one of the sconces' lightbulbs was out. 
Very inconvenient and frustrating to constantly call the desk and wait for repairs. I did not bother with the fridge, I just left it open 1/4 inch to compensate.</review>

This hotel was one of the worst I have stayed in. The price was way too much to be given a super small room with everything falling apart, ripped, stained and out of date. You could go to a local hotel and pay a lot less and have the same experience. Do not waste your time, money or comfort on this hotel.< /review>

We stayed at the Comfort Inn Palo Alto because of its proximity to Stanford Hospital and its discounted AARP rate. It was outstanding value for the price. Staff was helpful and friendly, even to guests that were not at their best, and the breakfast was well-stocked and had good variety. The decor of the room was above what I expected and was very comfortable. The high-speed internet actually WORKED at a decent rate, unlike what we experienced recently at another chain hotel. Parking was a little tight but seemed secure, and there was plenty of security lighting.< /Text>

Staff was friendly and helpful and recommended a great option for getting to the airport.  The wi-fi worked well the first day, but had problems on the second day.  Need more ports and plugs for electronic devices.  Although the room wasn't large, it had the basics and was well-arranged and convenient. Especially liked the full-length mirror, the combination tub/shower and the comfort of the bed. Coffee quality in room and breakfast area needs improvement.  Breakfast area and food options were good, but could be improved with more whole-grain products and later service hours-  staying open until 10:00 AM vs. 9:30 AM would be helpful.  Overall, a very good experience!</Review>< time>

The Palo Alto Comfort Inn is conveniently located on the El Camino Real. Close to many restaurants and minutes from Stanford University Eye Institute, which was the reason for our stay. Upon check in, I mentioned that we were there due to surgery, and Comfort Inn gave us a discounted “hospital rate”! THANK YOU COMFORT INN! A+<//review>

Lobby smelled strongly of body odor, room was dirty with mildew around the tile, dirty carpet & dirty bathroom floor. TV color was so bad it was almost black & white. Internet was agonizingly slow. Lobby is where breakfast is served. If you can get past the smell there is only 1 couch to sit on, and 3 plastic round tables with attached benches and no umbrellas outside. So in reality you have to go pick up your food and bring it back to you room to eat. Staff are standoffish and not helpful. 
We have come to count on Comfort Inn & Suites to provide a safe, clean environment and a good value on our travels. Apparently not anymore.< /text>

<Review>Very nice hotel. Very clean. Room was on the small side but the bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were wonderful. Short walking distance to pizza, convenience store and 24 hour donut shop that also serves burgers and breakfast sandwiches. Also a short drive to Veterans Administration hospital. It is pet friendly but clean. They serve the typical free breakfast and there are also two vending machines, one for drinks and one for snacks. Stayed here several times. Would recommend to others without hesitation.<//Review>< Pics>

The hotel was good for a couple of nights stay. The breakfast needs to be improved a bit.</Text>

We had just spent a week in Yosemite and were looking to get a good night’s rest and a shower prior to a day in San Francisco and our evening flight back east. We chose Palo Alto to be outside SF as to not totally break the bank but still get a safe respectable hotel/motel room. I can tell you the room was first and foremost clean and well maintained. The staff was friendly and helpful, and beyond that; proactive. I had to ask no questions or requests. Everything was explained and laid out clearly, from Wi-Fi password, breakfast times, if I needed a wakeup call, the location of rooms, etc. The bed was comfortable and I had a great night’s sleep. The bathroom caught me off guard a bit, in a good way. There was great attention to detail, from the bowed shower curtain rod to allow for more room, to the adjustable height shower head with wand, grab rail, free q-tips, etc. 
I couldn’t have been more pleased with the experience. I don’t usually write reviews but I knew I was writing this one the moment I checked out. 

Thanks.

As expected for an older hotel.  There is no fitness facility and the breakfast 'area' is not really an area.  You need to take your breakfast back to your room.  There are plenty of nearby restaurants which is a good thing.  It's priced in between the 3 star hotels and 1-2 star hotels.<//Review>

I had to change my reservation dates and the process was painless. We were delighted upon our arrival at the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff during check-in. We found the room to be very clean and uniquely decorated with all the needs of my limited mobility being met. It was very comfortable and the bed gave us a good nights sleep. Breakfast the next morning was pretty good as was the ease of check-out. We visit Palo Alto on a regular basis and this particular hotel will be our new home-away-from-home. Thank you Comfort Inn!<//Text>

Comfort Inn on El Camino Real in Palo Alto is located less that 15 minutes from Stanford University. It is reasonably priced. Complimentary breakfast. The rooms are spacious and quite comfortable. The only drawback is their Wi-Fi system which need to be upgraded.<//Review>

One of the lights didn’t work. There was an old used filter left in the coffee maker. The restroom and shower could have been cleaner. The free “refreshing” water I got to drink in the lobby tasted like it came from a pool.</Review>

There was another window by the vanity/sink area that you could see used to have blinds, but they had been taken down for some reason.

The bed was very uncomfortable and hard. The bathroom had mold in various sealings around the toilet, shower, etc. The shower nozzle was a weird attachment that didn't have very much pressure. The front desk person was extremely friendly. We love that they are pet friendly and have a small grassy area near the back for the dogs. Breakfast was ok, I wouldn't eat the egss. They didn't look fresh and looked like they came out of a box.<//Text>

My hisband had surgery at Sranford Hospital so my son and I needed to stay at a hotel.  This hotel was easy access, clean, and very quiet.  Comfortable and clean beds.  Bathroom could use more scrubbing but overall it was very good.  We especially appreciated being able to check in late.</Review>

The owner and staff of this hotel was very nice.  I had the opportunity to speak to him a couple of different times.  I was in the area because I was having surgery at Stanford Hospital.  It was a clean room and we basically had what we needed.  The WIFI was not that great, which was a disappointment.  We were disappointed that the snack machines were there but not filled.  The parking was very crowded.  With this being said, it was in a good location in Palo Alto and I would stay again.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>This is easily the worst motel in Palo Alto.  I struggled to find a single positive thing to say about it and honestly I could find nothing.

Everything seemed broken or was in the process of getting renovated.

The bed was uncomfortable and my back was screaming in pain my entire stay. The blanket smelled and the furniture was very old and tired.

I couldn’t believe they had signage outside indicating they had triple A approval.  When I inquired how on earth they were approved I was told they were NOT approved but decided to leave the sign up anyway!  Not only is that horribly misleading but it’s unethical.  I like many people often depend on the AAA rating to guide my decision making.

Give this one a miss!, it was a horrible experience.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Room had a couple MINOR (emphasize MINOR) maintenance issues that did NOT affect the quality of our stay and comfort. -- Excellent bed. Excellent housekeeping (cleanliness). -- Great value. Excellent price for the area. Excellent front desk experience. -- It has been a RARE event that we have had a poor experience at a Quality Inn / Choice Hotel / Comfort Inn (once that I can recall in our MANY stays with the chain). Comfort Inn Palo Alto maintains our series of quality experiences at these hotels.</text>

The breakfast area is reasonably small but I was able to get a seat with no problem.

Parking can be an issue as the area does not appear to have too many extra spaces for parking.  Not helped when folks do not manage to park in the marked bays.</text>< Pics>

The room was not dirty but everything in the room needed some repair. Patched holes in the walls. Drill hole in the door jam on the exterior door. Mirror was damaged. Beds were uncomfortable. The handle to the door opened up, not down. Sounds like a weird thing to put in a review, but standing outside the room trying to get in for fifteen minutes before getting a staff member to show me to lift the handle up not down made an impression. The place needs a lot of work.<//review>

The room smelled like cigarettes and when we left, they charged us $250 for smoking in the room even though no one in our room ever smoked a cigarette.
When we called the manager, they just said that they didn’t want to argue and hung up. This attitude to your customers is not okay. At least ask if we were smoking before you assume it. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to go to this trash of a place.</Review>

Parking (at no charge) was convenient, breakfast (also included) was hot (e.g., excellent Belgian waffles), USA Today was free in the lobby, and the maids, breakfast staff, and front desk people were friendly and very helpful. It was perfect for what I needed, and I highly recommend it.</text><response>None</response>< Pics>

<Review>Easy to get to. Nice accommodations. Was within walking distance of a variety of places to eat. Enjoyed the variety of breakfast itemsthe hotel offered. Staff was nice. Overall, it was similar to most hotels and it met my needs for my trip. Only downside was the rooms did nit filter out noises very well.</Review>< Rating>

<text>I was really pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I booked it for a really busy Stanford reunion weekend when most of the other hotels in the area were charging exhorbitant rates. The room was very nice. It was quiet even though it was right on El Camino. Very close to Stanford. Great breakfast with a variety of different hot and cold breakfast foods to please anyone. Friendly staff. Would definitely stay here again.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

Got a room on the ground floor. The room was alright. Clean. Very very basic Amenities. I was hoping though for more privacy, the rooms were clearly visible to everyone outside and not private. Also the staff could be more friendly.<//review>

<Text>This Comfort Inn is my first choice when staying in the Palo Alto area, about six time a year. The rooms are clean, the beds and pillows are very comfortable, and I love the "home" comforts in the room - coffee maker, frig, microwave. The continental breakfast is very convenient as well.
It would be nice to have an exercise facility, or access to one.
I do compare rates, and this generally has the most competitive rate for the area for the quality of stay.
But I give my highest ratings to the staff. Denise and her staff have always been helpful and friendly. If there's something missed, or if I have suggestion for improving the convenience in a room, they address it right away, and always show appreciation for having it brought to their attention so they can improve.
Denise has helped in several ways to make my experiences with this Comfort Inn very positive!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

We were able to park our car right outside our door, and the handicapped shower, toilet and sink areas were very well thought out. We needed some extra linens, and the management was happy to help us out. The grounds were also very well kept. Nearby whole bunches of great restaurants, and so convenient to stores and businesses in Palo Alto, as well as Stanford.< /Text>< Pictures>

I didn't have high expectations to start with considering the price is the lowest in the area, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  My king-size bed was awesome and the linen were impeccably white. The breakfast was very nice too. The staff were cheery both upon arrival and the next day at check-out. No complaints, I am a satisfied customer.< /Review>

<Text>I’ve stayed here many times before and never had any problems but this time it was different. After a late check in i was given a room around the back and just did not feel safe or comfortable with the position of the room. I asked for a different room only to be given a room that smelled of smoke (all rooms were supposed to be non smoking). After asking for a 3rd room, i was finally given one that seemed fine but the door handle wasn’t working properly. It did get fixed eventually but overall i was surprised at the difficulty in getting an acceptable room in good working order. I’ve stayed at this hotel many times before and never had any problems at all so it was surprising to encounter quite so many problems this time around. However, the staff were helpful in trying to get it all sorted.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

If a person is seeking a very clean, non-smoking motel, Comfort Inn should be considered. One can bring dogs, too. The rooms were really tidy. The staff is very accommodating. I would not hesitate to recommend this motel /hotel to family and friends. I was very happy with my overall experience during my 2 1/2 day stay.< /Text>

<review>First of all, the front desk lady who apparently answered my call was unnecessarily rude and cold.

I booked on a wrong date by mistake and understood that I'd not get my money back but the way she handled my call was so cold and rude. She said, "no we can't change your reservation and absolutely no refund. go ahead and dispute if you wish"
I remember I was looking at the correct date when I was browsing a booking site but when I moved to this hotel group's direct site, it seemed automatically changed to the wrong date with the rate cheaper than I intended to visit on. I did not double check and my reservation went though and my credit card was fully charged.
the first person who I spoke to, who had an Indian accent, moved my reservation to a correct date with a higher rate (100$ more), but I figured I'd not be able to afford it.
Thanking to my friend's help, I made it to the hotel and did not have to have a single word to the rude lady. The service and everything is definitely not worth more than 200$ a night even including a breakfast.
Pillows, pillow cases smelled bad. Breakfast is all sugary, fatty cheap food and drink.
I will never go back to this motel unless the rate is less than 150$/night. .</review><name>Yuka Kaneko<//name><userid>103160843092396396825<//userid>< gmap_id>

Very dated and in need of significant upgrades, the best thing was the front desk service, the good and safe parking, and good beds. The bedding and bathroom fixtures were clean but the overall impression of the rooms is not clean as the furniture, wallpaper, carpet and cabinetry are ancient. 
Internet signal was good but lacked appropriate security certificates so we had lots of trouble using it. 
I believe all rooms have a little fridge and microwave.<//Text>

<review>this is a great value priced motel for the area. the bed is very comfortable and the room was clean and quiet the only down side is the cell phone reception inside the rooms is non-existant you must stand outside your room to talk on the phone. once inside, the call is dropped. other than that, i would highly recommend a stay at this hotel. the restaurant choices nearby are top notch. I will be back.<//review><Rate>None</Rate><Gmap_id>0x808fba62028d118d:0x6f31c15be66eff25<//Gmap_id></record>

Book one of the ground floor rooms in the back of the property (rooms 133 to 136 if memory serves) and the grassy dog run will be right outside your door, complete with plastic doo-doo bag dispenser and waste can.

Clean rooms that appear to be recently remodeled and the exterior of the entire building appears to have fresh paint. Comfortable beds. The rooms are also surprisingly quiet. Even when it was loud outside (and that was often), it was quiet inside.

Nicely landscaped and maintained. Convenient parking.

A dry cleaner and a coin-operated laundry facility are nearby (down the road a small bit and across the street).

Hot breakfast included. Scrambled eggs, sausage, tater tots, yoghurt, waffle maker, juice, fresh fruit and more.

Very close to Stanford Medical Center. I didn't clock the mileage, but it was close. Maybe fewer than five miles.< /Review>

We stayed three nights in this Comfort Inn conveniently located in Silicon Valley near the Stanford campus. The room and bathroom were neat and clean. The bed was firm and very comfortable and the flatscreen TV was the best we've ever encountered in a motel. The included breakfast buffet has hot items like scrambled eggs and sausages. Areas for improvement are: faster Internet service, better soundproofing in the walls and floors, and wider parking spaces.</Text>

<text>This is a very good hotel for someone on a budget and content with the basics. The room was clean and the mattress was comfortable. The shower had great water pressure and temperature, which means a lot to me. I did enjoy the perks available: a mini fridge and microwave so I could enjoy leftovers from the abundant restaurants in the area and a tasty breakfast in the mornings. The shower had great water pressure and temperature, which means a lot to me.

My biggest gripe is really just that there were very few available outlets for charging electronic devices. You had to unplug the alarm clock or the lamp to plug anything in by the beds. I also made an assumption ahead of time (without checking the website) that there would be exercise facilities on site, but they are 1.5 miles away. Overall, it was a good experience for what I needed.<//text>< Pictures>

I stayed here during a last minute business trip because all of my usual choices were fully booked due to Stanford graduation. I was surprised by how pleased I was. The beds are very comfortable, the rooms are mostly clean (the TV remote in my room was sticky - eww) but the best feature to me was the staff by far. Because I was working weird hours they really went out of their way to make sure housekeeping could still visit my room daily while I wasn't there. They also adapted to my changing schedule expertly and managed to keep me in the same room even though I changed my reservation multiple times during a very busy week for them.< /review>

< Review>
This property is in a very good location - near to good restaurants, etc. The bedding was excellent and comfortable, and the bathroom immaculate. It is a dog-friendly hotel, and is, therefore, a great bargain when you can get a room at a good price. The prices vary widely, but this is our first choice in the area for affordable lodging when the price matches the quality. When the prices go way up, we stay elsewhere.<//Review>

I have stayed here thrice for long durations every time (5-6 weeks), I must say this is the most inexpensive we found in Palo Alto, nothing fancy but you get decently maintained rooms with a Flat screen TV, fridge and a Microwave< /text>

<Text>Overall we were very satisfied with out stay, here are a few comments: 1) the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful, we had two rooms and both were clean and nicely kept up 2) rather expensive for a Comfort Inn but given the location this is not surprising 3) breakfast is mostly "plastic" pre-prepared breakfast foods (typical of Comfort Inns) but the orange juice was a consolation 4) while not a parameter normally mentioned this hotel has absolutely the best flat screen TV I have ever seen in a hotel (50" Panasonic), a joy to watch. 5) many of the parking spaces are very narrow (marked "compact only) and typically there are alot of big pickup trucks in the lot.<//Text>< date>

<userid>None< /userid><Text>Stayed at this hotel near Stanford Medical Hospital - I was unfamiliar with the area - arrived late morning, and the manager was able to accomodate an early check in so I could get to the hospital.    Rooms were very clean and up to date with very good facilities.    Breakfast was tasty and fresh, with a good selection.    The manager was able to assist me with modifying my reservations, when we found out we would not need all the nights we had booked.    He was very kind and courteous, making me feel like a very welcome guest.    I would highly recommend this hotel to others, and would definitely stay here again.< /Text><Name>Anonymous< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<rating>None< /rating><text>I was in Palo Alto for an appointment at Stanford for my mom. We also had my 13 year old twins with us. Upon arrival I could see there was no elevator, so I asked for a ground floor room as my mother can't climb stairs. The man at the front desk was very nice, and accommodated my request. The room was very small, and almost not big enough for the 4 of us. It was difficult to find room for bags, but we managed. There was no closet, but a very small wardrobe. The sink was outside the bathroom, which made it nice for getting ready in the morning. The beds were comfortable, and it was quiet. Breakfast was nice, but there is no place to sit inside. Not as nice as other Comfort Inns we've stayed at, but it met our needs.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Very clean and affordable.  I always look for hotels with breakfast included.  That's always a plus.  The room was nicely furnished in addition to nice bathroom fixtures.  There was also a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, iron and hair dryer.  Friendly staff and free wifi too.  I would stay here again if I needed to be near the Stanford campus on another trip.< /Text>

Even do breakfast was free it had full menu, and staff keep bringing more and more, no items half full, always almost full and fresh.

<review>This is an old building and it looks old. The walls and furniture look well used. However, the beds are in EXCELLENT condition with modern, comfortable mattresses and bedding that is very clean and hygienic. I have no concerns whatsoever about the cleanliness and it's nice to not have to worry about that every time I come.  I use this hotel frequently for work visits.</review>< userid>

<review>I stayed at the hotel for three nights when I attended an educational conference at Stanford University. It was about ten minutes drive from the university. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was quite good. There were enough parking for all hotel guests. It was near many small restaurants and take-out eateries. It was also very near the Fry's Electronics. I did a search before booking and found out that it was the most reasonable hotel in the area.<//review><gmap_id>0x808fba62028d118d:0x6f31c15be66eff25<//gmap_id>< Pictures>

Room had been redecorated, but the quality of workmanship was poor.  Breakfast area was very small and crowded.  Hand railings needed paint.  No elevator, but staff willingly carried luggage upstairs.  First floor accommodation request was not honored.</text>

<Text>I found this Comfort Inn to be a reasonable place to stay. The bed was quite comfortable and the breakfast items available were reasonable. Staff was easy to approach and interact with. I did not encounter any problems, but felt that the cosmetic appearance in the room could use some attention to make the ambiance more inviting and pleasant. There were scuff marks and open screw holes from previous repair on the walls, as well as the beginning of peeling wall paper in a couple of areas. The walls are paper thin, so noise from adjacent rooms will carry. I would consider staying here again if my travels take me this way. Palo Alto is generally expensive, so this was a decent option, as it is priced fairly, compared to other hotels in the same class.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

It is so hard to find a decent hotel in Stanford at a reasonable price, but this is it. Clean rooms, great service, nice people. Since we were there for a track meet, we also met a bunch of other people from other colleges running in the meet. Just a great atmosphere. Note that it's 3 miles from campus, but the bus stop is right next to the hotel. We walked it and enjoyed the shopping on the way. Very nice.< /Text>

The beds were soft and comfy, with 2 pillows per person--one firm and one soft...perfect! Tall fridge, microwave, blow dryer and adjustable make-up mirror helped us get ready quickly. Breakfast was plentiful and provided lots of choices.

<review>Being just blocks from Stanford University, I imagined that this Comfort Inn would be truly comfortable, but that was not to be. A rude man at the check-in desk, a noisy parking lot just feet from the room door, a TV without a working remote, a breakfast that was served in front of the check-in desk, bad coffee and an empty egg pan at 7:30AM, all contributed to a stay that couldn't have ended sooner. I recommend you stay away from this dive. It might serve well as a pay-by-the-hour "comfort" inn.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808fba62028d118d:0x6f31c15be66eff25</gmapID></record>

<review>We checked into our three rooms around midnight after a long 5 hour flight and drive from the San Francisco airport. We were given three rooms on the second floor near the street and office.
The next day, Friday, we asked the office manager if we could change our rooms because of the noise from traffic and cars entering and exiting the hotel parking lot.The office manager offered us three rooms located near the back of the hotel which were much quieter. She notified me after they were cleaned and available by cell phone. We were traveling with a one year old baby who needed frequent naps in a quiet room!
The staff exceeded our expectations for providing us with quiet rooms during the Stanford Graduation Weekend.<//review>< user_id>

< Review>
Hotel is pretty much a hole in the wall of the main street there so being in the back of the lot was great as there was hardly any noise from cars/traffic.  AC unit smelled funny, there was a little trash under the beds, and a light bulb burnt out in the bathroom.  oh well, no big thing.  the check in was quick and easy as was the check out.  the food for breakfast was missing bacon but we cant have everything.  they did have the option for blueberry waffle mix, which my daughter loved.  bagels were weird.  all in all it was a good stay and to anyone needing a nice quiet stay i would definitely recommend this location.  also got some pizza from Pizz'a Chicago just down the street and it was amazing.<//Review>

<text>The hotel isn't bad at all. Room was clean and bed was comfy. My complaints are merely that the toilet runs non stop (refill valve leaks causing tank water to overflow the water line and run into bowl), and the fridge door is offset causing it to have a leaky seal which results in frozen food that I merely wanted chilled and not icey. Loved that the showerhead is one of the handheld ones with a hose, and the fact that there were cotton balls and q-tips provided in the room. Overall, it is a very nice comfort inn, and the minor annoyances I experienced are probably room specific and not a hotel wide issue. Would stay here again.</text>< pics>

Beds are comfortable, nice TV, fast internet, and typical breakfast. This is an older, motel-type facility that has been updated but still has inexpensive furnishings and relatively few amenities.

<text>A very nice hotel to stay at. Some of the features in the room seemed a little old, some of the wallpaper was peeling, however the refrigerator worked, the TV worked, and most importantly, the bed was extremely comfortable. The shower was fantastic also.< /text><date>1531180800000</date>< Name>

<Text>Overall my stay was good, it's the price.  I always choose the Comfort Inn, because your hotels are consistent in every town I have ever stayed in and I feel safe.  they are always clean which is a big thing for me.  Your staff is always friendly and accommodating.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

We really enjoyed this hotel for it's location and cleanliness.  We will be traveling to this same area on a monthly basis, and unfortunately, will not stay here again as we were unable to enjoy a hot shower at the end of the day.  The water pressure / temperature is almost non-existent, to the point I couldn't even get the shampoo out of my hair due to lack of water.  That, alone, will prevent us from staying here again.<//review>

It was a very small, but clean room. It was a nice stay, until they decided to come in and clean our carpets without even asking us first. This left us with wet carpet for the rest of our stay there. Until that point, it was a nice stay. But, this ruined it for me. Nice location along a major street. Relatively close to shopping, restaurants, etc. I feel like you could get a much better room for the price you pay somewhere else.< /review>

Room is clean and comfortable. Bed is very comfortable, ironing board and iron inside closet, retractable clothesline in bathtub area, room has microwave, coffee-maker and half-size refrigerator, plenty of good-quality towels, desk clerk and housekeepers are friendly and helpful, motel was quiet the nights we were there; free breakfast in lobby.

Negatives: Breakfast is not that great, but there are plenty of cereals, coffees and breads which makes the breakfast OK. In-room closet is very small. Parking lot is small, but how much time do you spend in a parking lot? Laundry carts are visible on hotel walkways during the day, but so what?

This is a great deal for the money; highly recommended<//Text>

<Text>The Comfort Inn is a relatively inexpensive establishment for the area. The rooms are relatively spacious but could use some upgrades. A little mold in the shower, a chair that looks like it definitely should not be in the room because of stains and age, a little wallpaper peeling off the walls. The rooms were relatively clean and the beds were a little soft but the pillows were good. It has a nice TV and charging station for your electronics next to the bed which is very convenient. There is no closet in the room but they do have a a small armoire to hang your clothing. Overall I would say that it is a good value for this area.</Text>< Response>

I really just needed a place to sleep while up at Stanford for Water Polo Junior Olympics. It was close to where I needed to go and was the cheapest I could find, which explains the not very nice grounds. The room was at least clean and the breakfast provided was pretty good. There is parking but the spaces are so small it was hard to find a space late at night, as one vehicle would often take two spaces. I did not have any problems while I was there, so it serves its purpose. Everything seems over priced in Palo Alto and this motel was no different. It’s just not that nice to look at....no character and could use an update.< /Text>

This hotel is relatively close to Stanford's hospital and downtown Palo Alto is just a few miles away. It was quiet in the rooms not situated at the very back of the motel where we have stayed before. I would not take those rooms because they back up to private residences which can be very noisy if they are having a party. 

I asked for two rooms and they were nine rooms apart. It would have been better had they been situated together. The reservation was made a good two weeks before the date of arrival.< /text>

My stay here was fantastic.  The hotel itself was great -- exactly what we wanted at a great price.  The staff were very courteous and helpful.  Having hotel issues can really ruin a trip, yet having a great hotel can make a trip all-the-better.  Very glad we stayed here -- it was excellent all around!< /text>

The room is very clean. It is small. I was in a two queen size room. It only had a small Armoire for storage. The room will feel cramp if there are four adults and luggage. The price was reasonable. The hotel is near Atherton and Menlo Park. The hotel is in a location near several stores and restaurants. Overall experience it was very positive. No issues of any kind.< /Review>

We have no complaints. It was nothing fancy, but nice and clean and comfortable. There was a frig, microwave and coffee maker in the room that we did not use, but if we stayed longer they would have been great to have.
Breakfast in the morning was fine and included. Simple, but a nice bonus. We would definitely return.< /text>

The beds were very comfortable with some pillow choices.  Good options for plugging in multiple devices. Complimentary hot/cold breakfast options.  Bus stop right outside.  Other than the Tesla gallery within a short walk and Stanford a mile-long walk away, nothing great close by.  However, within a mile there are some great places to eat and shop.< /review>

The room was spacious and clean. The wallpaper was showing its age. The price was reasonable. There was plenty of counter space around the sink and there was a fridge and microwave. The breakfast was definitely better than your ordinary continental breakfast. The people who checked us in and out were friendly. We were given a room at the other end of the hotel which was away from the main road, much quieter. We would definitely stay at Comfort Inn again.< /text>

<review>My wife and I have stayed at this Comfort Inn on several occasions while visiting a relative in the area. We've always found the rooms to be reliably clean and comfortable. The location is convenient to Stanford University, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. The price seems appropriate for the value.< /review>< gmap_id>

I come to the area once a month and this is my favorite place to stay. The staff are great the room is extremely comfortable and the internet is quick. Since I come down for work and stay 3-4 days, I love having the fridge and microwave in the room for convenience and cost saving. Bed is comfy! Area is quiet.< /Review>

Mid range hotel, no frills, everything was a little outdated but still worked well. The place was clean and the service was good. Good value for the price (at least for this area). They also had breakfast in the morning, which was a nice bonus.</review>

<text>We booked this hotel when our son-in-law needed surgery at Standford Medical Center. How grateful we are for the manager, Denise, and her wonderful staff. The room was a comfort zone during very difficult times
We have returned to this Comfort Inn two more times when our son-in-law had subsequent surgeries.
In addition to a great staff, the hotel is clean and comfortable. Coffee is available and they provide a breakfast that serves all diets. We are returning next month and I am glad that we will have the comfort of this hotel again.

I called late at night and was able to book a room fairly quickly. It would have gone faster if the clerk wasn't using canned, marketing-speak. 

The room was clean and had plenty of plugs for all of my electronics. 

The bathroom was clean and there was plenty of hot water. 

The breakfast was the usual fare. 

I didn't interact with the staff much but they got me checked in and out quickly.< /Text>

This hotel was a good place to stay for a short business trip. Compact room with clean bathroom. Free breakfast was good for those seeking to economise. Staff were really helpful & friendly. It's a bit of a hike to the Caltrain station though.< /Text>

The hotel did the job. I was in town for work. The room was clean, good channels available on the TV including HBO. Only issue was that my windows were open when I checked into the room which was a little strange and dangerous since it opened up to the walkway outside. Nothing special overall, but definitely was comfy and did the job<//review>

Very satisfied with overnight stay at hotel. Pleasantly surprised at overall cleanliness of front desk and room. Quiet room even on a weekend. Convenient location to Stanford. Sausages and eggs, but no bacon. However, faithful waffle maker made up for it. Would stay again. Great value.</review>

<text>I have been staying at the Comfort Inn in Palo Alto for several years, my husband is a patient at Stanford Hospital. While the hotel is certainly not a high end hotel it does serve the need of what we need while in Palo Alto for appointments. It is always clean and comfortable, the staff always friendly.
I am always surprised, however, at the increase in pricing, I do realize that demand for accomadations, location and competition have a big influence in the costs. I sometimes feel the increase is unreasonable. I do realize if I pay in advance I can reduce the price, although there are times when medical appointments must be changed. Unfortunately, your pre pay option does not allow for changes in reservations.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808fba62028d118d:0x6f31c15be66eff25<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The rooms are a bit small but this is a busy city area with tight real estate. I'm more used to small town and wide open suburbs. But they made good use of the space in the room and it was very nice. We had a room in the very back facing away from the parking lot and that made us a little nervous especially arriving very late on the first night. But it turns out that it is fenced and backs up to the playground of a child care center so it was very quiet in the evenings and weekends. We never felt concerned for our safety. There was enough parking even on the nights that there was no vacancy. The breakfast was fair being a standard Comfort Inn breakfast. The waffle maker seemed to be having problems, it never got quite hot enough to cook the waffles enough inside. The staff was excellent. I broke my reservation up into 3 to use points on the nights that were more expensive. The night clerk went ahead and checked me in on all 3 reservations that first night and we didn't have to do anything more after that. If you have points, make sure you pay attention to the nightly rates. The mid-week rates are more than twice the rate of the weekend nights but the points are the same for any night.

This was a very clean and comfortable room. Staff was kind and friendly. Easy access onto the main street for Palo Alto and surrounding cities. Wonderful Thai food right across the street and a Starbucks with a drive through also within one block. Bring an extension cord, not enough plug ins for easy access to electronic devices.</Text>

I would never stay here again. Floor was so nasty, Had to put shoes on immediately after shower. Tile bathroom dirty, moldy grout, woodwork not finished, trash stuffed in hole in woodwork, curtains two different sizes, arm chair had multiple stains, mismatched furniture. Sending pictures with letter to comfort inn and owner.</Text>

The breakfast was great, and the bed was excellent.  Free breakfast, free drinks in the lobby all day, free internet, free parking, free paper for an inexpensive motel was a better than expected experience.  A minor problem with the lobby computer was quickly handled by the helpful desk manager.  All personnel were friendly and helpful.</review>

My wife and I stayed at a Comfort inn on El Camino Real in Palo Alto. The staff was nice and helpfull. The TV was proped up on back of dresser, ready to fall over at the slightest bump. The room was so small you could barely walk around the Queen size bed that was advertized as a king bed.
I booked room through Choice Priviledges who told me hotel was 2.2 miles from my hospital, and turned out to be 9.8 miles away.< /Text>

I have been to Palo Alto four times in the last 10 months and have stayed at the Comfort Inn in Palo Alto each time.  You cannot beat the location and value for your money in this town where everything else seems so overpriced. Not to mention that you even get complimentary full breakfast and coffee and tea all day.< /review>

It was a good place to stay as my husband needed tests -- cheapest in the area.  Beds and pillows were great.  Adjusting the room temp was a challenge.  Peeling wallpaper.  You could hear through the walls but you get what you pay for.<//text>

<Time>1550646398777<//Time><rate>2< /rate><Text>Clean, but severely overdue for maintenance. Let me share the nonstop disappointment of maintenance negligence.

Very first impression started with chipped paint on the stairwell hand rails to the 2nd floor.

The door card key reader was worn out. Tried 20 times to unlock the door. A few times I got a red light to blink. The rest of the times the reader didn't register the card. Asked the front desk for another card key and that one works every 5 swipes.

Inside the room, the carpet is ripped, the bathroom tile is cracked, the toilet tank lid is cracked and held together with duct tape. The wallpaper is peeling (worse than it was in the lobby).

I hope the owners take time to get these rooms back up to snuff. If the management cuts this many corners on maintenance, it makes me wonder what else was skimped on. When was the last time the drapes were cleaned or replaced? How often are the pillows replaced? How much of the bedding is regularly washed? How sanitary is breakfast?<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fba62028d118d:0x6f31c15be66eff25< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This hotel was satisfactory. I think the price was too high, but it was all that was available that evening. The room was clean and quiet. Although they allow dogs, there is no designated pet area. The breakfast was very nice and the staff was quite friendly. The WiFi did not work at all, and phone reception was quite spotty.</text>

You could eat off the bathroom floor or bathtub, beds are always comfortable and linens are spotless. The curtains sometimes could be fixed so there's no gaps when pulling them closed, otherwise, always a great place to stay and get some sleep when between appointments at Stanford Hospital.< /Text>

<rating>3</rating><text>Clean rooms, but leaves a lot to be desired
1. It's conveniently located
2. Rooms are clean and have basic amenities shown on their website
3.  Staff though courteous they keep referring queries to their manager
4.  Also there seem to be a lot of disconnect between the property team and the central choice team. Eg. Out of the blue I was told that city tax is increased by 1.5percent..on asking why I wasn't informed upfront they said they didn't know it.  Such city changes don't happen overnight... They finally adjusted this amount, but communication gap is clearly visible.
5. Breakfast is good. Though menu remains exactly the same all days they have a decent spread much Better than the grab and go bfast options in this area.
6. My Visa forex credit card didn't work at their place and the reason given was their payment gateway doesn't accept it.  .this same card  works all through america...I had to pay by cash....that's quite some inconvenience and the team need to really sort it out with most out of country travellers adopting the  forex card

The staff is very responsive to visitors. I didn't meet one staff member that did not have a smile when they saw me. The room was immaculate. The bedding was also immaculate and comfortable. The hotel was full, but it was quiet and I had the best sleep in a week.</Text>

Good accommodations, nothing too fancy. TV and AC worked well. Room fridge was a little noisy. Very nice bathroom and excellent bed. Overall very satisfied with the experience.< /Review>

A moderately priced hotel in a high priced market area. The hotel has obviously been overhauled and it seems that the management knows how to treat travelers. The room was clean and neat. The manager was friendly and efficient. A positive experience at a moderate price.</Review>

Well Maintained, good breakfast.

Special mention to the care taken by the kitchen incharge. She was continuously monitoring the items available and was filling before they were over.

The rooms are good .. good linen .. clean .. nice parking .. management was good.

Thanks for the wonderful care taken especially the kitchen.</text>

I originally stayed at a different hotel in Palo Alto while my daughter was in Stanford Medical Center. It was a stressful time for me and I was very dissatisfied with my previous hotel. So I checked out and found this Comfort Inn. It was SO much nicer for about the same price as the previous hotel. My stress level was decreased tremendously by finding this nice hotel that was also affordable. It was clean, comfortable, had kind staff members and I felt safe.  I will definitely stay here in the future if I should be in the area again.  Thank you.< /Text>

A nice and clean hotel. Large rooms, reasonably equipped. Location is OK. Other than that - very simple, breakfast is served in disposable dishes, variety is limited.
You're getting what you're paying for, stuff is nice and all, but I wish it was a bit more fancier.</Text>

This is a modest hotel but has all the comforts needed for a great stay. The room was attractive, though small. The bad was very comfortable, the bath clean and well-stocked. There are amenities such as microwave and fridge, and internet service. I often travel with dogs (not this trip) and the pet area was roomy and equipped with waste disposal bags.

For the price and location, this hotel is a real find!!<//review>

The room and lobby were neat, clean, and modern. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. The front counter staff were friendly and efficient. It was a good value and good location. The water pressure at the bathroom sink was less than desirable, lower than normal. They really should find an out-of-sight location for their laundry carts rather than next to the stairs - that's bush league and the only black eye the hotel has.<//Review>

<Text>Great front desk staff and cleaning people too. Everyone was very helpful and pleasant to work with. The breakfast was good--a nice variety for a hotel. The worst problem with our room was the water pressure of the shower--it was awful! We didn't feel like there was enough space for parking, and there were a couple vehicles who took up more than one space, too. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>The 1st floor room was incredibly claustrophobic, it only had one small window looking out at the dumpster, the door was hidden in a small hallway where the electrical breakers were located, which produced a loud hum all night and didn't allow for a restful nights sleep. Don't stay here if you've been traveling and want rest and relaxation, you won't find that here.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Beware of Choice reservations. Double check the reservation a day or three after making your reservation. Carry a copy of it to the hotel in case of foul ups at their end. If you check out on Monday, don't expect housekeeping to do a complete clean up on Sunday. In California, expect room prices about one third higher than in the Southwest. Within 60 miles of Google HQ, expect those prices to be even higher. For instance, one night in Palo Alto runs more than $200 per night.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808fba62028d118d:0x6f31c15be66eff25< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>This hotel is close to Stanford campus, the bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. Only had a one night stay but would stay again. Did not use the ammenities except breakfast which was adequate. The only complaint I have was with that the parking spots - they were very small for a mid-size SUV.< /Review>< GmapID>

Unable to get any internet connection...at all! Was told this is a "dead zone" for ATT and Verizon. Very unpalatable breakfast. Was that suppose to be something made with an egg? Sausage overcooked. Smallest room I have ever had in my life and I paid over $200. Will not stay here again. Front office staff were great and really tried to make my stay pleasant.<//text>

<review>The staff and location - if you need to be in Palo Alto - are good.  The price is generally ok for the area.  Also good is the full hot breakfast.  Eggs, sausage and waffles included.  Bad -- the room cooling system, which you cannot set to a temperature and goes on/off as it sees fit.  You will be too hot - too cold - too hot - as you cannot control the temperature, plus the unit is loud.  Kept waking me up.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>It is located less than 10 minutes from the Stanford University campus. There is plenty of parking. The quality of breakfast was good. The service of the hotel staff was good too. Unfortunately, the internet was out-of-service during our stay.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>I ordered a full Beijing Duck for delivery. I really wanted to like it, but, unfortunately, it wasn't as delicious as it is in another restaurant: the skin and the sweet sauce were too salty. Besides, the overall taste of the dish was a little bit strange. In addition, this restaurant uses styrofoam containers and plastic bags, which cannot be reused or recycled. The other place puts everything in paper bags and #5 containers that I can reuse and recycle later. I'm pretty sure, guys, you can do better.<//Text><resp>None<//resp>< Time>

<Text>This place is amazing! The everything on the menu that I have tried has been great. Keep in mind that three peppers for spicy is EXTREMELY spicy, still great but a lot to take in. Service is fast and efficient. However, don't expect friendly conversations with the workers because they very focused on the next task they have. Overall I love this place! I would definitely recommend it.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Stay away from this restaurant!  We had food delivered excited to try something new. We ordered Pork Lo Mein, chicken cashew and egg foo young. All in all about $70 worth of food for two people. The food arrived quickly from GrubHub after placed our order.  The food was barely warm. It arrived so quickly after the order this could only mean that it was already made NOT FRESH sitting in a tray in their kitchen.  The egg foo young was so hard my wife had to use a steak knife to try and cut through it. Mind you this is an egg dish. The Pork Lo Mein smelled bad, had a thick smokey sauce poured on it where the noodles were not cooked and the pieces of pork I wouldn't feed to my dog. The pork dumplings we ordered had a horrible fish smell and taste. When we called to let them know about our food the owner got on the phone and started yelling at my wife right away. They started to blame GrubHub for the poor quality of food and my wife explaind that GrubHub did not make the food. Again the owner started screaming through the phone. All we wanted was a remake. We only live about 10 minutes away. These people obviously do not care about the quality of their food and the owner of this so-called restaurant doesn't give a damn about customer satisfaction. Restaurants are having a tough enough time with the closures and restrictions due to the covid-19 virus. We will absolutely frequent other restaurants we already know care about us as customers. Again, STAY AWAY from this restaurant. You will be extremely disappointed.</Text><time>1615690588049</time><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

<Review>A solid dumpling spot - you're going to spend around double versus one of the classic Richmond spots but the location can't be beat for a brunch spot on a nice weekend. They have a few outdoor tables but the indoor ambiance is... meh.</Review>< UserId.>

For a "Dim Sum" spot allocated to the 818, it's pleasant enough and does the trick. There are no traditional carts being driven around (not a problem), the food is fresh and made to order. I felt that the Siu Mai didn't really taste as good as I'd like but they have a lot of options that are unique to this restaurant. Their salt and pepper chicken wings were the best thing out there. Delicious menu items like their House Special chow mein. I was thoroughly happy with my meal.

As for the service, for a chinese restaurant it was really good! Ha I laugh because if you know 626, chinese servers are rough but it's like they catered to the types of clients who'd be coming here so I totally appreciate that!<//Text>

I love Din Shanghai Rose!

I've been coming here for years and I never get sick of the food here despite not being a huge dumpling fan in general.

I always get the pork soup dumplings but the shrimp and chicken spicy wantons are pretty good too.

No other soup dumplings can compare to Din Shanghai Rose.</Review>

<text>Really enjoyed the Dim Sum here. It's great to know that there is really good Dim Sum in town. The interior design is full of vibrant red colors mixed with black accents. I came here with my family and really enjoyed it. Free validated parking as well.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6UJ-1edmiGt8qm_27eBopz6Uqb20nWJ14kFhh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

The restaurant also validates parking in the garage right behind it which saved us from the nightmare of looking for street parking.

The atmosphere is very modern and clean, which is nice. The restaurant feels very welcoming, visually and through the staff. The food was tasty and a good price as well. I would definitely recommend this place for some authentic Chinese food and delicious dim sum!< /Text>

Well, there is nothing to say about this place but if your time is valuable, I would not suggest you to go there. At least, go somewhere where people do not lie about the order’s estimated pickup time. So that you will not have yo wait 30 min like I did!<//Text>

It's been a while since we visited,  but love it! Everything is made to order on the dim sum menu and our waiter, 3rd year in, is still there!  Usually late lunch is quiet but would love to see this place at night. Decor is awesome and Rose is always there making sure QA is on point.</Review>

Service is pleasant enough and the place clean, but the food is woefully bland, which makes sense given the older white crowd it draws.
The shrimp har gow, chicken corn soup, shrimp fried rice, and shrimp and crab dumplings all tasted like the same sustenances in different shapes and had no flavor at all. Only the Shanghai pork dumpling had any flavor whatsoever.

We won’t be back. And are immediately going elsewhere to taste the flavors we came here seeking.</Text>

Perfect place to visit with family and friends. Pretty place and inviting ambience, the service is also awesome, staff are friendly and nice, they always wear their best smile, it makes me smile too because of them. They served yummy and delicious dim sun and all other foods that makes me and my colleagues come back many times in a week. Highly recommended, best dim sun restaurant.<//Text>

<Text>Dim sum at its finest. No gimmicks, no fusion, no insane pricing. You get great food and amazing service at a great price point.  Rose the owner is just delightful,  and always ready with a smile.  Try the steamed pork buns, the green beans, spicy chicken wings you will be happy.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2bdfb709d74cb:0x2dec42bf9b220c69</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<date>1549780120341<//date><Text>The proprietor, Rose, is a wonderfully friendly and accommodating  woman. You can tell she takes a lot of pride in her establishment and has a well earned rapport with the local patrons.

The menu offers a broad range of choices. Each dish is consistently of high quality and great flavor. Overall, it is definitely several notches higher than the standard fast food approach to Chinese cuisine that you can find in many corner plazas. The decor and ambiance is cozy and inviting, everywhere is meticulously clean and the seating areas are tastefully appointed with numerous cultural artifacts.

One of the most popular if not busiest Chinese establishments in the Studio City area . The Sunday dim sum is extremely popular with a great selection at a reasonable price. This is highly recommended place for a pleasant dining experience.<//Text>< rating>

The food is absolutely exquisite!  As a foodie and brewery owner my palette isn't easily satisfied. Shanghai Rose is one of a kind in today's world of chains and mediocrity. Shanghai Rose had the best, most fresh ingredients and I knew I was in for a treat from the very first sip of my egg drop soup.  The chicken potstickers were divine and the mongolian beef and kung pao chicken combination for lunch transported my tastebuds without 2 days of flying. In short, best Chinese food in So Cal...possibly All Cal. Two thumbs WAAAAAY up my friends. CAN'T MISS!!! 👍👍</review>

Shanghai Rose is a great place for a social or business dim sum lunch,; nice ambiance, attentive service and validated parking (even if you stay for hours to enjoy a leisurely relaxed meal).However, food quality depends on current chef and is not on par with dim sum in Monterey Park or DTLA.
Began with salt & pepper calamari listed on menu as a starter and if it were the usual battered rings, it would serve as an appetizer. But this was squid hood cut bite size, battered and then stir fried, more like an entree style'. The turnip cake was plain, just fried daikon but tasty. My favorite dim sum is rice wrap which was authentic and delicious on a previous visit. But this time was disappointed because there was mainly rice and just a bit of pork, and not steamed long enough for the rice to become glutinous. The BBQ pork seemed more like red-cooked or roast pork than the usual dry-rack BBQ. The sesame buns were the best I've tasted, light and not too sweet and unlike  the typical  "cannon ball." usually served elsewhere and much too heavy for dessert..
I prefer week days because you order from a menu (instead of passing carts) so your food is cooked fresh to order. Foodies might prefer M Park or DTLA but for locals it is convenient and enjoyable..<//review>

A little dead on a weekend morning. Dusty cloth napkins that will put lint all over your clothing. They don't let you mark the paper menu for dim sum, which can get difficult to track when you have more than a few people and you can't really see how much you're ordering. Doesn't feel very authentic.</text>

<text>I was so happy to see this place in the San Fernando Valley  they serve dim sum and we all know if we want Dim Sum we have to travel to the San Gabriel Valley.  I was a bit confused by the outside that looks like a palace made me feel like it was an Indian restaurant, but the inside Is definitely decorated very Chinese.

The food was great Har gow, dumplings, clams, green beans all fantastic, but what really won me over was that they had so many dim sum seafood options, lobster and shrimp, scallops, crab.  Most Dim sum places are all pork, I like to have options.  The service great!  and they have other classic Chinese dishes if you're looking for something more than Dim Sum alone.

On The Weekends they do Dim Sum Carts, Can't wait to go back for that!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Time>1482649827652</Time><Rating>4<//Rating><Review>The food here was better than I originally thought. I had dim sum here once and a take out of two lunch specials. I wouldn't say it's San Gabriel quality, but it's definitely pretty close to Chinatown quality, which makes it the most authentic out of all Chinese restaurants in Studio City. The dim sum had quite a variety, offering even chicken feet. Everything from the shrimp hargow to the pork shumai was pretty authentic and tasty. I must say that I was most impressed with the dessert sesame balls. Some of the best I've ever had. You will not find any other establishments that sell this, or egg tarts, in Studio City.

The downfall is that the place is a bit pricey, about 1.5 times more than what you would pay for dim sum in Monterey Park. However, this place is fine enough that I don't feel so compelled to go 30 miles out of my way to eat dim sum. It's really the most you can ask for in a predominantly upperclass White neighborhood.< /Review>< pictures>

Forget about american chinese food, if you wanna experience real chinese dinning, try this place. Dim sum is an upper class of chinese food.</Review>

<Date>1433564215061< /Date><text>i've never actually had dim sum and neither had my friend so we decided to check this place out. the sim sum dishes are all affordable and ended up being plenty of food. we got the lobster dumplings (honestly only thing i wasn't a fan of), the chicken dumplings, the egg rolls, the pork buns, and the general tso chicken.
we both really enjoyed the meal and were stuffed by the time we finished.<//text>< Response>

<Text>We love hanging out. Yesterday we arrived in this excellent place which we didn’t know before. We had a beautiful evening there with fine food and a nice crew and a distinguished cook. We  added this place in our list  and we will no doubt come back soon.  Highly recommended.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Text>The best service I’ve had in years! She was amazing, went over and above and even warmed up my rum cake. The jerk chicken was tender, juicy and zesty with Jamaican spices, and the half plate with rice and plantains was so much food I had to get a box! I’m always wowed when I get an authentic experience and this was definitely that. Can’t wait to come back for the Reggae band on the weekends!< /Text><gmap_id>0x808f8f9c832a9b69:0x51cc34156502c17a<//gmap_id>< rating>

We were craving Jamaican on a Sunday evening and this was literally the only place open in East Bay. We were happy to find that all the other great reviews were accurate.

Chill spot and very traditional Jamaican vibes. The staff seemed a little backed up and it took a while to order and get the food. Not sure if that is standard or just an off night. Either way, it was totally worth the wait! Jerk chicken and island shrimp (half orders pictured) were amazing; deeply spicy, hot and fresh. Kind and real people.

Would love to come back and try more of the drinks on a reggae night.< /Text>

I was here a few years ago, and it was fine
I went today and it was superb. I had the scotch bonnet catfish, and it was both delicate and vibrant. (Sorry for the ridiculous, pretentious words, I'm just trying to describe a delicious meal.) The plantains were just sweet enough. The veggie patty was just salty enough. The only thing that was missing was the homemade ginger beer I had last time.  The atmosphere was funky and fun.

<rating>5< /rating><review>Not enough superlatives to say how much we liked Sweet Fingers Restaurant. My meal of curry tofu and vegetables came with rice and peas and some fried sweet plantains. My companion's jerk chicken was the definition of perfection in spices. Accompanied by Red Stripe and good music, neighborhood people and the best staff.

My plan is to keep going back until I have tried everything on the menu.

Pay Sweet Fingers Restaurant a visit soon.<//review>< pictures>

Great food! Best authentic Jamaican food you'll find in California. Excellent service. The employees were friendly,  patient and accommodating. There was a familial appeal to the place. I will definitely be visiting Sweet Fingers again!< /text>

The Rasta youth served me my husband and children very well he made us feel so comfortable. The food is AMAZING. I’m from Southern California came up to the bay for my family funeral and me coming here made me feel great again. The music the people is LIFE. Thanks for the great meal . I will always come back when I come up. I give 5 stars I wish I can give more.< /review>

Best Jamaican restaurant I've had in the Bay.   Tried the beef patty, crab cakes, and Jerk chicken along with a Bob Marley rum punch.  Everything was fantastic. Service is slow, but then you don't come to Jamaica to be in a hurry.   Great place to chill, relax, and have some great food and drinks.<//Text>

Wanted to try their famous oxtails at 820 pm they told me and my party of 3 they were closed. After we sat down.
I asked what time do you close?
9pm

I don’t care how good they claim to be. That was BS.</text>

This restaurant is extremely disrespectful. I don't care where you are from you do not treat people like they are less than. They say they close at 10 we showed up at 8pm and the dummy chick didn't open the door. She watched as through the window with no assistance while ppl are in there. This is why we as a community have problems because of the respect. I'm not sure how yall do things on the west coast but on the east coast west Indians have respect.< /Text>

Service is poor, I think they should hire a full time server, who can set a table with napkins and silverware and knows how to split a check into equal portions among several credit cards, at a minimum. Unfortunately, I found out that I'm not a fan of Jamaican food after this, my second time attending this establishment. Other people in my party liked the food especially the ox tail (which may have not seat well for some of them, the next day). If you like Jamaica food ordered it go, it will save you time especially when going in a large party. I hope this place improves in terms of the food and service wise cause I want local business to thrive. Will update this review when stop by to check this place out.< /Review>

Very disappointed in the service and food portions yesterday. I always eat here an not only has the price went up on the food but the  servings are smaller. I ordered a combination plate of chicken and oxtail and only ended up with four small oxtail and paid $29 for what I still don't know. Perhaps I'll just go to Kingston 11 from now on.<//Text>

< Review>
I have been to Sweet Fingers twice and had a blast each visit. They have an awesome after houses location which stays open to 4 in the morning. The DJ's are dope  and know how to keep the party going. The atmosphere is always inviting and upbeat. Can't wait to make another trip.<//Review>

The food was the best part, not a restaurant it is 75% a bar.
The place was not comfortable and the tables are small.< /review>

<text>Food delicious and atmosphere quite nice however the business hours are from 2 to 10 and the kitchen may close sooner than 10. We went on a Sunday thinking we'd grab a bite before the live music...kitchen was closed before 9....rather disappointing. Come early.<//text>< Response>

<Review>Food was good, the chicken wings were ridiculously Good. I tried the shrimp curry and it was a sooooooooo spicy, I have a high tolerance too.

It seems like a one man band though, one guy is serving/bartending/bussing. Also when we showed up at 8pm on a Saturday night we almost walked out because nobody was there. The feeling wasn't welcoming at all.

Feel like they need some kind of remodeling done inside, I noticed a few electrical violations when I was sitting down. (Exposed wiring) definitely a safety hazard</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I had the Jerk and rice, it was okay,I dont mean it in a bad way, its just that  coming from the islands, it wont be fair to try to compare.

precooked food and salted, I wait for 45 min for my family food, horrible experience.
they also have bar and suddenly someone is fighting.
if you have family i don't recommend this restaurant if you don't believe send an incognito tester.
this place has too many starts
i don't come back again</Review>

Well, When we went in there, the bartender was rude. And we had seen a "Big Street Rat" crawl behind the bar!

The owner was not surprised, said we had been drinking to much. Just awful, ruin my 1st & last time there.

Also, I was hungry, but lost my appetite.< /text>

<Review>I randomly stopped by while walking down E 14th in San Leandro while visiting from Michigan.  I thoroughly enjoyed my food. I had the Brown Stew Fish and it was great. The portions were large but some entrées were slightly expensive. The food was definitely worth every penny. It was a nice environment with Raggae playing in the background.  Next time in town, I will return.< /Review>< pictures>

The food was orgasmic in my mouth.  The prices were fair for the food, Clive is a doll,…  My only disappointment was the outrageous $70 pitcher of delicious margarita (which we found out about when we received the bill) and the 18% tip was already added into the bill prior to our approval.  I would go there again, but I can’t afford to drink there.< /text>

The best transmission specialist (3rd generation) and Sal the owner will go above and beyond...not only take a good of your car (even during his vacation), but you as well. He is really the last honest business man and a good family man. Price and workmanship (of his staffs) are outstanding. I was little skeptical and worried at first but after meeting with Sal in person, the jitters and fear went away. Thank you Sal and God bless your family and good fortune on your business. Take good care of yourself.</review>

I dropped out of the sky at 9am on a Friday and Sal (owner) dropped everything he was doing for me... He even told a vender to wait while he payed all his attention to me!!... He answered my question with complete assurance and I couldn't be more pleased with his service!!!... I am a real human being and not an automated bot :)<//Review>

First of all Sal and his team get 5+ stars from me !! My transmission went out on my Nissan Altima so i googled transmission service shops and came across these guys...i sent Sal a message and he replied back early the next morning..and mind you this was a Sunday AND the shop was closed...im a nurse so i was worried about having to miss work to transport my car to the  shop Monday morning..well i talked to Sal and he was so great and kind enough to come to my house and have my car towed Sunday afternoon that way i wouldnt have to miss work and my car would be there first thing Monday morning and he also met the tow truck driver with my car at the shop...COMPLETE CUSTOMER SERVICE !! these guys are good and couldnt ask for better customer service..also Sal gave me a day/time that my car would be ready and sure enough my car was ready just like he had told me...Thanks Sal for all you did and for getting me back on the road...ive already recommended you guys to a couple of people already !!!👍👍< /Text>

< Review>
We have sent our fleet of smaller vehicles to Rancho Transmission for years. the team and owner always provide us complete details of the job and get our cars back on the road quickly... More then a few times when we thought we would have to replace the entire transmission, Sal would inform us it was a simple repair... That honesty is hard to find. We highly recommend.< /Review>

I have had two great experiences using Rancho transmission, the first time was two years ago Sal the owner was very up front and told me exactly what the prices and the time frame was going to be. The second time I had to bring it in was last week I was in a pinch do the fact that it was an unexpected repair. Sal got my vehicle right in and have the job done way faster then I expect and went way Beyond in the customer service department. He even took care of some unexpected issues that I didn’t even know I had. And then there the little things like showing all that was fixed even down the the fluid that was replaced. This type of service dose not exist anymore but at Rancho transmission you are treated like family. I would and have highly recommended this shop. Thank you Sal and the crew at Rancho transmission for the great experience.<//Review>

Sal replaced the transmission in my mustang and actually ended up putting a police interceptor trans in which has a shift kit which gave my car a little more pep. 5 years later I am more than pleased and have referred multiple people to this shop.<//text>

<Text>Owner came to my home to test my transmission. And once at his shop called for transportation to get me home. Upon completion he also sent transportation to have me returned to the shop to pick up my vehicle. A+ quality service in my opinion.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Sal, the owner, was extremely courteous. I had an appointment, and he was able to get my transmission fluid changed in an efficient manner so  I would be on time. Also, I checked all the prices in the local area ,and he definitely gave me the best price. Great experience!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>My wife found this mechanic. My concern was that my transmission was slipping in my Suburban. He was very patient listened. He gave probable diagnosis. That would not necessarily bring him business. He was very nice and patient. I would trust him in the future to work on my car. If I ever have a problem. I will be going there. Don't know why my vehicle stop slipping. It was parked for a while. Maybe that was it.<//Review>< Pics>

Had my Transmission go out on a Sunday afternoon on my way back from lake. Had the truck towed here and left in parking lot. Called main line and left a message. Sal called me back (on a Sunday!) to confirm he got message. Needed a full rebuild. Sal gave me the exact price and day it would be ready, which was a week. He needed an extra day, but not a big deal. He did a great job, was very friendly and even pointed out some other maintenance items I wasn't aware of (non Transmission related so not a money grab). Shop is impeccably clean and very professional. Would definitely recommend him to anyone.< /Text>

< review>
These guys are awesome!  Referred to me by my mechanic…  I told Sal I was going to buy a camping trailer and wanted the Astro Van trans set up to pull it.  Sal listened to every word and asked questions.  He then outlined and educated, by showing, all he was going to upgrade.  The van was on time and to the estimate.  I was amazed by the transformation and the difference in pulling it could do.  After the first trip I came in for the break-in checkup.  Sal took time to answer a question and even test drove and plugged in his computer for a complete review.  He did not charge extra.  Year later I came in to ask a simple question and again he wanted to check it out and test drive (no charge).  Extra service that was unexpected.  BTW: This is the only shop my wife likes waiting in because Sal’s wife decorated it.  The waiting area is family friendly.<//review>

These guys are great. They'll diagnose your car, give you an estimate, and once the work is done the final price is either really close or exactly the same. They do great work and stand behind it.< /Text>

This is the place you want to go to if you have transmission problems or suspect them. Sal diagnosed our Tahoes twice and told us it was not the transmission and told us the problem. Sal is honest and really knows his stuff.< /Review>

Amazing shop!!!! Sal and Pete were awesome to work with. I Drive for a living and had a throwout bearing go out on my clutch in California, and they did everything they could to get me in and out of the shop as fast as possible, knowing that I had customers waiting. They put in a custom performance dual clutch in my 2010 Dodge Cummins diesel. They helped out with me getting a rental car and even bought me lunch. I have many good things to say about the shop but most of all is that Sal is honest and makes you feel like you are getting a fair deal and not getting ripped off. If you are looking for a good trustworthy and honest auto technician, then look no further. Also shop is really clean and feels good to have your car there. All the best to you guys.</Text>

Being a "car guy" I've always been a bit weary of taking my car to a shop so when the transmission on my sons car was failing a family member said to go to Rancho Transmissions. I met with Sal who said let's go for a ride.  I thought I was going to push the car again but he really knew what was happening with the car.  We drove it down the street and then the failure occurred again.  He explained what was happening and after sitting for a few minutes we drove the car right into his shop.  The transmission work was completed in less than a week as promised and the price was fair.  His follow-up a few days later was a true sign of a reputable business.  I will share this business with any of my family and friends any chance I get.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It's a klepto's paradise, and the not enough staff to manage all that but they work hard and hustle when needed. Prices are the same. A step up from Dolla stores.< /review>

Just left here. I come here regularly. My husband and I arrived at 7:54, just needing to run in for a foil pan. The tall Mexican guy was at the door and said there was to many people and they were about to close. Someone came out so we asked if we could go in now. He said they were closing. We walk to the car and turn around just to see him letting in a woman and her children.... judgemental much?? We'll be contacting management.</Text>

It's dirty and there were boxes of merchandise to be put away EVERYWHERE. The cashier rudely told me to leave my bag up front. The prices are the only thing good.< /Review>

It has a variety of merchandise, that is cheaper than most big box stores. A lot  of unique  items, it's  convenient, because unlike the crowds,& lines at big box stores, it's  much easier to do a quick shop,if needed.<//Text>

i used to be a chunk skeptical about the price of this gym and i have to inform you that i used to be impressed with at the size of the gym and all of the equiptment which incorporates ellipticals, unfastened weights, electricity plate, bikes seriously this vicinity is fantastic.  It beats EQUINOX over the park, seriously  this vicinity is wonderful, positive it does not have towel carrier or an overpriced juice bar, but I left with a splendid impression of this location.<//review>

The music might be my favorite part, they play classic alternative punk; Blink 182, All American Rejects, etc. Devon, one of the staff members there, was very helpful. All in all, definitely gonna keep coming back. Side note, I live in Los Angeles , that's a hell of a drive if it wasn't a good place to work out.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Great gym with an amazing staff, decent variety of equipment and fun classes. I highly recommend! Some of the low ratings given were preposterous; Metro Fitness deserves 5+ stars without a doubt</Review>

<Text>Was a member of this gym for a few years and just recently ended my business with them on a sour note.

Positives: usually not too busy, has what you need for a decent workout, nice array of classes.

Negatives: locker room needs it’s own section; only one shower ever works and is usually clogged so you end up standing in a pool of murky gym water, the sauna is ALWAYS out of order. There is a perpetual smell of sewage and usually a urinal filled with unflushed urine that won’t go down.

Ceiling leaks, be sure to stay away from the electrical box that is normally right underneath a large leak.

You rate will magically go up and they’ll blame it on “tax cuts” which makes no sense.

If you ever decide you want to cancel your membership you can expect a non response from the email they direct you to until they’ve squeezed another month’s payment out of you. Reminder, they want 30 days notice (ridiculous) and in my case they agreed to refund me my money but it’s been a couple weeks now and I’ve yet to see anything hit my account so I’m not holding out hope.

I advise you to take your business elsewhere.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I bought a Living Social deal for 2 months of unlimited classes for $29, and it was a good deal. The gym is spacious and has plenty of new equipment, as well as a small sauna in the locker rooms. The instructors for the classes are really energetic and cool, and they know what they're doing as far as fitness, especially Ralph. They offered me a free training session with a personal trainer (they offer it to all new members), which I declined but they insisted I should just do, so I did. Afterwards the trainer was extremely pushy in trying to convince me to buy future sessions with her, and I just really don't want to be force sold something when I want to work out on my own. They are shady with billing as they told me I was on a month-to-month membership, and yet they signed me up for automatic payments without notifying me. The only way I found out is because they emailed me a bill with a past due charge and a late fee after they couldn't charge my debit card because it had expired. They are owned by ASF International Corporation and they operate with corporate shady politics. Go to your local independent gym with trustworthy policies.< /review>

My boyfriend and I were visiting his family and we decided to try out a Boba Shop in his home town, just to see how it compared to our usual spots in OC/SD. We weren't expecting anything too amazing but still kept an open mind. They only allow one person in the store at a time, which does make it hard for groups that might want to order together - my boyfriend took his little sister inside to let her see the menu and they were able to stay in there together.

Strawberry Tea ($5.00): Strawberry Green Tea is one of our go-to's for any spot, but unfortunately Boba Cove did not deliver. The drink tasted artificial and somewhat watered down. The Boba itself was OK - it still had some chew, but was on the harder side.

Green Milk Tea ($5.00): We were pleasantly surprised by this drink! It had a nice strong Matcha/Green Tea flavor, but wasn't overly sweet. The Boba in this drink, however, was a bit harder than the Boba in the Strawberry Tea.

Overall, not a bad Boba shop considering the little variety of choices you have in Lancaster.<//review>

<Text>This was my first visit to Boba Cove, however, my daughters love it and go frequently. I am not usually a fan of boba, but Boba Cove's bobas are plump, sweet, and not rubbery like other places. The ambiance was nice and staff was very friendly. We ordered three beverages and sweet potato fries (which were by far the best I've had in the AV). It was reasonably priced and the service was great. I will definitely be back.<//Text><rating>5</rating>< user>

This place is awesome. Not bad for their boba and drink prices, a little pricey in regards to their food but it's good quality stuff. The calamari is amazing, cooked correctly and perfectly tender, not chewwie like most places. Their popcorn chicken is delicious and sweet potato fries are the right amount of seasoning and crunch. I love this place, and this was the first time I've been there. Their menu offers a good amount of items to boot. Will come back again lol<//Text>

I use to love Boba Cove but they over price their drinks and advertise them in sizes they are not. Their so called 24 oz is actually 16 oz and their 16 oz is actually 12 oz. They have items on the menu they sometimes refuse to make.</Text>

The boba itself is great, but the food is salty and the smoothies are chock full of sugar and those are about the only 2 flavor profiles they seem to understand. Prepare to wait about 15 minutes average if you order food as well.</review>

Great snacks, too, like sweet potato fries and popcorn chicken.

It's a small place with a few tables. You can grab some boba and go, or chill there.</Review>< Pics>

Best chicken salad ever! Super fresh! Haven't had a bad meal here. The staff always have a smile on their face. And their boba drinks are the best in the AV by far. My hubby and I like to ask for less sweet(he can't have too much sugar) even still, our drinks are always perfect! BE WARNED if you eat/drink here even once...you will be craving it the rest of your life!!! So much good in such a little Cafe!!!</Review>

Bobas are delicious here and it's about 10 minutes to get your order but if you order food prepare to wait about 30 minutes. Food is great as well just wish they wouldn't take so long on them.<//review>

Yummy milk tea.... waiting for my chicken. Salad. I really wanted shrimp spring rolls but they were not ready. They open at 10am and don't have their spring or veggie spring rolls ready until 12pm. I feel like these should already be prepared.</review>

The drinks are decent, but the ramen burger was over seasoned, and it doesn't k ow what flavor it wants to be.

This is a 3 star establishment that I am assigning 4 stars to because of being located in Lancaster.

Calamari isn't crunchy. It's tough, feels and tastes like it was prepared and frozen to save on cash. I've had it before and it used to be delicious but it's mostly salt and flour, aged probably a week in the freezer, and then fried.

The only thing saving this place is that young people like boba and there isn't a proper hang out/boba specialty restaurant out here.</Text>

<Text>The Thai milk tea with boba is delicious, almost as good as the rich stuff with real cream! (Though this is supposed to be non dairy, and so far true on that). Not a huge fan of the pho, too strong on the cilantro for me - maybe because I'm used to the more Philippino version family friends make. But over all a good taste. friendly staff, but some of the ladies had some crazy hair going on. Really hope they weren't making the food. However, it was worth if just for the boba!< /Text>< Gmap_id>

The ramen burger is disgusting. Its patties tasted like microwaved soy burgers and were very greasy. We also tried the calamari which was bland and just not good. Smoothie was okay.
I noticed most people were ordering the phö. If you find yourself at Boba Cove, maybe try that.< /review>

<Text>Best boba in town. Small clean dining area, friendly staff. Good vibe young staff running the shop. Lots of different flavors on boba and smoothies, however, limited food menu. I always get my order quickly. These menu items are my family favorites: Taro smoothie boba, beef pho, calamari, pork stem bun (siopao), fresh shrimp lumpia (wrap). So far everything we tried was tasty. I have yet to try their ramen burger am hooked on the beef pho for now.<//Text>< Pics>

This is one of the few places to buy boba in the Antelope Valley. The service is fast and the food is decent. I visit primarily for boba which does not disappoint. The staff is very friendly and ready to help if you have any questions about the menu or your order. With plenty of parking, is place is a must go to get your boba fix.<//review>

I love this place but they should update their menu and make french fries in my opinion just me because I love fried food and I think they should add more pastries other than that the bobas are delicious and the boba isnt old or anything it tastes fresh< /text>

I like it somewhat I guess. Maybe I'm too picky, but, compared to the ones we usually get in Seattle...this here tastes more like milk and sugar. Barely any avocado. I felt like they skimped out on the avocado part : (<//Text>

<Text>Very small, very limited menu, VERY TASTY FOOD! Pho is excellent. I'm not a boba tea fan so didn't have that but they do have a big selection of many fresh fruit drinks. Loved the popcorn chicken, shrimp rolls were good, sweet fries also excellent. They are very customer focused and if you don't like something they offer to replace it with something else! Been there twice, excellent each time, will go back again. BTW the bowl of pho is big, enough for 2 people unless you're very hungry.< /Text>< Pics>

{'time': 1526275467863, 'text': 'Hi Archie! Thanks for frequenting our shop! We appreciate the continued suppprt. On the stamp cards, the free drink is actually only for the 16 oz cup, and it’s stated on the stamp card. The dollar and change would be charged to upgrade the free drink to a large size. Sorry if the staff didn’t make it clear to you.\nThank you again,\nDanny\nManager'}< /Response>
<user_name>Archie Bailey<//user_name>< Review>
Best smoothies in town, staff is friendly and welcoming most times, its a place I frequent for the smoothies, no boba. If you buy enough smoothies, getting your card stamped, you get one free, they say, but you end up paying a little over a dollar.<//Review>

Should be on the BLVD.! A refreshing change of pace to the valley. The Boba is good, and the Pho is sooo satisfying. My first time tasting a Ramen Burger and i was hooked.
It's a cute place with a great staff. Hope it's here for the long haul....< /text>

Best boba to get around the AV! Their milk teas with boba and snow fluff is a few things I recommend. Good place to stop and grab a bite before or after class since it's near Antelope Valley College. Like I've said the place it great, but if you're going to visit during the summer be prepared for EVERYONE and their mamas to be in that place haha. Its super popular, so its always packed and hard to find a seat during the summer. It does take a bit of time for your order to come out but I wouldn't worry too much, its so worth the wait. One last thing i love is that besides the menu, they sell small snacks like fresh spring rolls, pork buns, mochi, and red bean cakes. Only problem is that they rotate it so everytime you come in, you have a chance of it not being out displayed on the counter for it to be sold.             :( And for a girl who loves mochi and red bean cakes, this is one sad thing for me haha. Wish they could make those a permanent choice on the menu!

With all that being said, if you're in the av or passing by as you go, Boba Cove & Cafe is definitely a place you'll want to stop by.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c25b304099565b:0xc2a9d91dd000e435<//gmap_id></record>

Wife had the Ramen burger. I wasn't to sure about that so I had the pho. The pho was just ok, but the ramen burger turned out to be very tasty!<//text>

I won't comment on the boba but try something other then the tapioca milk tea w/boba. The pho is amazing though and the service is pleasant. I agree with the majority of reviews you should try this play out. I wouldn't agree that it leaves you hooked but it's definitely one of the places you would consider going to especially if want a healthy dinner of Pho.< /review>

<resp>None</resp><review>NOT LIKE LA/OC boba places at least  when it comes to teas and milk teas. Jasmine milk tea tastes like pudding, the other flavors have a very heavy taste of powder creamer/powder milk. I have been to 50+ boba places in sgv, la, and oc and even the worst ones (joints in shun fat supermarkets, boba loca in west la) are just bad versions of the best ones. This place is completely off the charts in terms of flavors. Price is also higher than any place in LA but nothing wrong with that if the product was ok. The fact that they have 4.9 review rating is disturbing.</review></record></dataset><record>

We are so happy that we decided to enroll our kids at Aqua-tots! My daughter loves her instructor Jemma  and all week asks to go to swim class. I have seen such improvement on swimming confidence. Also swim safety is so important! Highly recommend.< /text>

They are amazing and I couldn’t imagine my kids swimming with anyone else. I love that when my kids walk in the front desk staff always calls them by name when they are saying hello. The swim instructors are all on the same page and are teaching the strokes the same. They give feedback after each lesson so I know what my kids need to work on throughout the week. We have had good experiences with all the coaches we have used (of course my kids have their favorites). When my son was having a hard time with swimming we tried 3-4 different coaches to get the right one (coach Andrea). When he graduated he was nervous but eventually we found Coach Joey and he was fine again. We are now using Coach Brooke and he loves her. My daughter has been great with any Coach she has used. She is currently swimming with Coach Hector and Coach Makena and enjoys both classes. There are so many class times and if we need to change classes or days we can usually do that with ease. I feel confident that my kids can be safe around any pool and know what to do if they fall in.</text><rating>5</rating><UserId.>111593038795373924882< /UserId.>< Date>

<Review>We had tried many swim schools in the area and we found Aqua Tot. We called this is a PreSchool for professional Swimmers ! The water is warm and doesn’t smell Chlorine as other places. All the coaches are very sweet to the kids and know how to work with each kid. The fee is a little pricey but so worth it for kids. Highly recommend!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The owner is great. We have been with AquaTots for years and as such, swim coaches have come and gone and we have needed to find new ones. She is always very responsive to any concerns that we have if the new coach is not pushing our children to their full potential. All of our very few issues have been addressed immediately. Everyone has been very friendly and we have found some very amazing coaches. Just sad that some of them have left due to unrelated reasons (moving, medical, etc). We would definitely recommend Aqua Tots Costa Mesa< /text>< Pictures>

Despite the challenges that everyone has been facing, the staff have worked hard to ensure safety for both the kids and the parents. I have seen great improvement in my son’s swimming skills and he’s always excited to come for his classes. Thank you all for your great dedication</Review>

< Review>
They do a great job of teaching a solid foundation and building on that.  They are also flexible with their scheduling, and that helps when other issues pop up.

My only real criticism is the format, 4 kids per one student means your child will have alot of downtime. I often see kids day dreaming while they wait for their turn.

Still, a savvy parent can schedule lessons on off peak times, and you can stack the odds in your favor that there will be less than 4 kids in your kids class.<//Review>

Everyone is so nice, welcoming, and accommodating. The front staff always greets us with a smile, and they engage the kids in conversation.

The swim instructors are always professional, and fun 😊. I like getting the feedback from their instructors about how the kids after their class. I also really appreciate the email with their progress card attached.

Aqua Tots is always clean. The pool, the sinks in the back, changing area for the babies, and the changing rooms, always tidy.

I looked at a lot of swim places in my area, and none of them checked any of the boxes of things I was looking for. After about a year of looking I found Aqua Tots, and every single box I was looking for was checked. It takes us 20-30 minutes to get there, but I wouldn’t go anywhere else.< /Text>

< review>
Coach Taylor at the Costa Mesa location is the best, she an absolute Gem and game changer for my son in his swimming journey. My son has never felt more comfortable and safe in anyone else’s care other than my family’s and of course us as parents. She is very attentive, caring, patient and willing to work with his ability each and every class he has whether or not he is progressing or regressed she’s always out of courage and always has him trying new things and he ends up leaving with a smile every time. He has progressed so much in the past four months. He started off slow and each class continues to progress and learn new skills she works with him so carefully and is very hands-on and doesn’t push him to do something he’s not comfortable with which I’ve seen other coaches do as I sit there and I have never missed a class and will at times scan the pool
And observe the other coaches with their classes and students. The locations is no more than 5 minutes from my house and the staff are very attentive to the request I’ve asked regarding if the coach calls out to please call me prior to class starting or as soon as they know, so that I can reschedule my son. The only negative is that kids seem to be sick a lot and their parents are not keeping them at home and the amount it germs they are adding to a smaller enclosed area with kids whom some may be vaccinated and some may not be (our family and my son are pro vaccination so my son is vaccinated) however with all the kids that we’ve seen there since coming coughing and being sick my son has picked up two awful bacteria bugs (sicknesses) while being enrolled. so that is why I give this a nine rather than attend because I feel that the school and the facility itself could implement more rules and terms on sick children in the water being that they are in close quarters with each other as they do at a public school require vaccinations I feel that in a public pool kids should be required to vaccinated when they are in close quarters as they are here.<//review>

{'time': 1576883155914, 'text': "Thanks so much for your incredibly sweet review Meagan. I will be sure that Coach Taylor sees this as it will make her so happy!! I am also so happy to know your son is enjoying classes and progressing really well. We always feel so honored to be a part of any child's swim journey :-)!! I am so sorry to hear about his sicknesses. I have a son too, and it is NO fun, so I feel your pain. We do our best to ensure parents keep their children at home if they are contagious. Most of our families are very respectful of this. I am sorry that you have had some other experiences. If there is anything of major concern, please feel free to address it with the Front Desk so that we can handle it in the moment. We know sometimes sickness is inevitable, but if there is anything we can do to assist in the moment, we will absolutely do our best. Thanks again and Happy Holidays! - Caroline"}< /resp>

Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The facility is always clean and the staff make it fun from the minute you walk in.  Most importantly my son loves and adores his swim instructors JJ and Tierney! He looks forward to swim class every week.  Our instructors are amazing, they show how much they care and always with a smile. He's becoming such a great swimmer and with such confidence.  We are very grateful for them.We LOVE Aqua Tots xo< /Text>

Not productive for us. After spending more than a year the child did not learn much, all the money spent and time driving up and down and at the class, we tried all- group, semi pvt and pvt, the problem was having different teachers for each class so the progress was not monitored though we tried telling the teachers, we felt the facility just doesn’t push the kids enough. Ours was an unfortunate case.<//text>

Dear "a Mesa" (owner)...
You asked what would make me change my review to 5 stars? I found an answer.
On every occasion that I have visited I have found clumps of hair floating around the bottom of the pool. On my last visit I took one of the bunch of strands and draped them across one of the small blue paddle devices, hoping someone would find it and realize that cleaning needs to be paid attention to.🙄

First time here. Haven't formed an opinion yet. Even though this place is for "Tots", they have space for us seniors. We do water exercise. It was a pretty good workout.
Stay tuned.<//review>< pics>

Breakfast/brunch was sooo good! Massive quantity of food, made with fresh ingredients. Bottomless mimosas makes it even better! Friendly reminder, don't forget to tip the servers, they do an amazing job!</Review>

We love Venita Rhea’s! The portions are large and we often share an entree. A little disappointed in the Louisiana Omelet, there was very little hot link and it was all at one end of the omelet. The flavor was good.</text>

Customer service was excellent. Waitress was on top of it. The food was flavorful, hot and not overly priced. They had pumpkin pancakes that melt in your mouth. Only thing I was not crazy about was the Mimosa. The orange juice used seemed like an artificially flavored juice which I don't personally care for. I recommend this place and intend to go back regularly.< /Text>

<Text>OMG the food is delicious! The prices might seem high when perusing the menu but when the food comes out you forget the prices. The plates look amazing and they are full of flavor. Half portions are only a dollar less so you might as well bring home some excellent leftovers. Bring your appetite you're going to need it.

The waiters and waitresses are super friendly and on top of their game.< /Text>< Rate>

We've loved Venita Rhea's for years. Every year I wait for the pumpkin pancakes. And they're back!! Eating inside is available, but we sat outside. Tables are spaced apart. Staff wears masks and are as friendly as ever!!< /Review>

<user>106604033500709031943</user><Review>I'm not complaining about the food itself it was good. But it was as good as any other breakfast place nothing special.. what was extra was their prices holy cow..A FIFTEEN DOLLAR PANCAKE!!! it was a big pancake but still for fifteen bucksyou would think the fruit or toppings would come with it but no that's 3 dollars more... EIGHTEEN FREAKING DOLLARS... NO WAY NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING WORTH IT.  Do yourself a favor go to any other breakfast place on the planet have the exact same breakfast with no wait and save yourself a ton of money.< /Review><Rating>3< /Rating>< resp>

Good, solid breakfast. Huge portions (at least what I ordered). May or may not visit again, there are better options in the area, but definitely worth the visit</Review>

If I could give less I would!!! My boyfriend and I love trying new breakfast spots in different towns and cities, this was by far the worst we have had to date.  It took 45 minutes just to get food ordered and they were not that busy and had plenty of staff. When we did order is wasn’t even our waitress and she said, “I see your waitress keeps passing you up.” 25 more minutes we receive our food and it was awful!  The chicken fried steak was soggy and the gravy was bland, the orange juice was sour from the rind being juiced with it.  The bacon was not as advertised “thick cut” it was thin with bad marbling.  The eggs for scrambled were egg beaters not fresh eggs and the potatoes were so bland you needed 2 teaspoons of salt to make edible.  DONT DRINK THE WATER IT IS ROCKLIN TAP AND HORRIBLE.</review>

If I could rate zero stars I would. After we checked in several other group checked in after us. For some reason they were seated first. When I inquired why I was told we were next. Ok so server was friendly but not in a hurry to take our order, to check on our meal or to get our check. After I had placed my leftovers in a container, I found a nasty hair in my food. DISGUSTING!!! I asked for that meal to be removed from my bill and they flat refused. We will never go back. I hope the health department visits them soon.< /text>

What's not to love about Venita Rhea's?  The food is consistently top-notch, as is the friendly service.  Whether you go for breakfast or lunch, this is a must try restaurant.  Allow a little extra time, because it's going to take a while to choose from all the incredible selections!</review>

This was our first time here. Worse experience we ever had. We were skipped twice by the host. Then the service was slow. The last straw was a piece of hair on the plate. We told them and they refuse to take the meal off the bill. I should have taken a picture and posted.</Text>

Sorry but Venita Rhea's has been going downhill for quite some time. Our last visit the owner was napping under a table with a napkin on his face. Very disturbing and unprofessional. Really struck me as odd. The staff has always been very friendly, kind and knowledgeable. Sad to come in to find out our favorite waitress doesn't work there anymore. The drop in food quality along with the loss of our favorite waitress and bizarre behavior of the owner has soured our love for this once favorite place. Won't be coming here anymore. Good luck.<//text>

Reaaaaaaally good biscuits and gravy.  Awesome chicken fried steak and the orange juice, hooolllly cow.  A lot of people say "fresh squeezed" but this was legitimately fresh squeezed.  Best orange juice. 10/10 favorite breakfast place in Northern California.<//Text>

fantastic, looking forward to next time. service was fast, friendly and the food scrumptious. I had the Eggs Benedict with Egg Plant and the Hubs Steak and eggs. The eggplant was moist and sweet, the eggs just right topped with Bearnaise. The steak was flavorful, no additional seasonings required. The fresh squeezed carrot juice was a perfect complement.</Review>

Good food; nice variety. Cute decor.  Very busy. Long waits. Orders mixed up creating a longer wait. Very noisy and cramped. I suggest trying it at least once to see if it's your thing. Some people rave about it. Others find it so-so.  My family is divided between 2 and 4 stars, so I gave the average of 3.</review>

Lunch is busy, which is a good sign! Menu is good old middle of America food. They do breakfast and lunch. Close at 3pm. I had the Liver and Onions. Good choice!! Best Liver I have ever had bar none!! Lots of it, good quality and cooked just right. Lots of fried onions. Often restaurant's go light on the onions but here they give you lots. Yummm. And 3 big thick rashers of bacon. Also a large helping of mashed potatoes well done. Bowl of tasty gravy on the side. All in all everything just right. 5 Stars for the Liver and Onions!!< /review>

Very tasty breakfasts in a fun and friendly environment. I've always been impressed with the quality of the food when we have gone here. Also a fun restaurant for the kids. They have a fun wall painting that has all kinds of hidden movie characters, and it is always fun trying to find them all! Highly recommended.<//Review>

The place is packed on WEEKENDS . THE Food and service are excellent for the cost. We get a coupon so our meal can't be beat.  When they are that crowded, we try to get the same menu items or simple items. When it's busy,  everyone is running including Ralph the owner. We love this place. They have a new menu items bi-weekly, I think.</Review>

Venita Rhea' s is a great family owned local restaurant.  They serve breakfast and lunch.  They are very popular so you may have to wait during peak hours.  Make sure you come hungry!  Everything is delicious and the portions are huge!  The wait staff are all very friendly and experienced.  Many of them have been working there for years.<//Text>

I have been coming here for quite a few years and i don't think I've ever had something that wasn't delicious. The service over the years has been hit & miss but this time our waitress was attentive and our order came out surprisingly quick. Of course we left fat & bloated LOL! If you like eggs benedict, they have one of the largest selections of different types to choose from. If you are seated on the left side near the large mural, while you are waiting for your food, check out all the "little surprises" and secret little items or characters randomly scattered into the landscape. Someone had some fun with that and we seem to find something each time that we hadn't seen before. They are super busy during your typical brunch hours so we prefer to go a little closer to lunchtime if its a weekend. Weekdays don't seem to be as bad.<//Text>

Still has the best mural though.< /review>< Pictures>

We moved from the area but when we visit the grandchildren we make this a regular stop. KJ was our server this time. She had an amazing humor and fast on her feet. Our meal was amazing, try the chorizo hash!! Btw, no sign of the cook under the table with a napkin on his face, we looked forward to that, maybe next time!!< /Review>

Excellent experience over all but why I'm really writing this review is because of the Eggs Benedict. The poached egg could not have been done any better. I mean there is nothing worse than getting Eggs Benedict and having a badly done egg. They know what they're doing here. It was perfection. And they have lots of options at that. Excellent place.< /review>

<review>It's all about the little extras at Venita Rhea's. Like the free extra egg, the juice that comes with your meal, the high quality ingredients in their meals. I could go on; but rather you should. Go on out to Venita Rhea's.  You will be impressed.< /review></record>

So sorry to report this place has gone downhill over the last 10 years.  Service is good, staff is friendly but not helpful (Shannon is the exception as she is both friendly and helpful).  I just paid 18.50$ for 2 chocolate chip pancakes, bacon and a small glass of orange juice.  I keep saying I’m never going back because of declining food quality and taste but for some reason I do because it’s close to my house.  Save yourself some time and money and go somewhere else.</Review>

<Review>Tons of delicious breakfast and lunch options - both classic and unique - and everything was prepared very well. They also have an unusually large selection of hot sauces, which always makes me happy. The service is friendly and attentive. Parking is easy.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

If you've been here you already know the service is spot on here. The kind you cant get in often in busy places. The food is great and honestly I cant say enough good things about the establishment. Would definitely recommend!</review>

This place is so wonderful and busy I'm not sure I want to let anyone else know about it!😀  Food is amazing and abundant; staff is supurb; and owner is caring and attentive.  The fact that some of the staff have been there over 18 years is a testament to the quality of the management and the excellence of the food served there.  Love it!</Review>

This place has a great menu and the food is wonderful.  My only complaint, and it was entirely my fault, was slow service.  I came alone and they offered me a table or a seat at the"bar".  I chose the latter.  Iwas the only customer there and it took a while to get service.  There were lots of servers there, it's where they input the orders and, it turns out, where the staff take there meal breaks. I suspect everyone just assumed i was someone else's guest.  Still, I got everything I wanted and it was delicious.  I'll just choose a tablenext time.</Text>

<Review>This is one of my favorite places especially for breakfast. It's not very close to me and I  drive by probably 50+ breakfast places to get here but it's well worth it. Their Venita  Browns (think fully loaded hashbrowns) are awesome.<//Review>< Pictures>

I don't know if they were purchased by a  new owner or not but I think it has a new owner.  Food wasn't up to the quality it was. Mind you it wasn't bad it just wasn't the same. Large portion but so so quality.</text>

I've been coming here since 05. The food is really really good the atmosphere is very quaint and friendly. The Waitresses are very nice and give very good service. This is my wife and myself most favorite restaurant for breakfast in the Rocklin and Roseville area. I highly recommend trying this restaurant, you will definitely come back.< /Review>

<Time>1515395897407< /Time><text>Our server was gracious, but nothing was special or seemed to justify what we felt were high prices.  Chairs were old and flat as boards with the cushions worn out.  Loved the idea of the free coffee while we waited but it was not very good and left us not wanting to buy more as we ate.  Never let our waters go down much so loved that.  Pancakes were very large and fully cooked but otherwise nothing special.  My California Scramble turned into heartburn alley.  Burgers were well presented and looked good but tasted nothing special and do not compare to the similarly priced Red Robin premium burgers.  Nothing was bad or unnaceptable, and some of the small touches they do are great but we left spending a ton and no desire to return.< /text><username>Richard Yancey</username><gmap_id>0x809b1ee10b46c585:0x785dc43fd7e77039</gmap_id></record>

<review>Very good breakfast, satisfying portions. The food is perhaps a little pricey for breakfast, but if you live in the area, check your mail for the coupon mailers -- they usually have a buy one entree get one half off, or something similar. That makes it great food for good value.< /review>< Pics>

My cousin and her husband wanted to take us to Venita Rhea's to celebrate my husbands birthday, what a nice time we had. I had read the review about this restaurant and wanted to check it out. There is nothing left to be said that I didn't read about. We live up in the mountains where the portions are quite large so I expected this after reading the reviews and they were very generous. The staff very friendly, the restaurant very clean, the food was FANTASTIC and the decorating made you feel real 'homey'. Would we return, without a doubt and we will hope that this review encourages you to go too. Thank you VENITA RHEA'S for a most wonderful time with my cousin and her husband.<//review>

< Review>
I have always loved Venita Rhea's, and have visited it often throughout the years. This Sunday my sister and I went and had the very best breakfast and service experience ever! Thank you to Patty for making it so special for us. What a treat - the benedicts were to die for, the mimosas, and best of all was the loving service. Thank you Ralph and staff for having such a marvelous place for us to enjoy!</Review>

The hospitality, service and quality of food is beyond expectation.  Your dining experience is nothing short of sitting in your friend's kitchen talking about family and friends over a cup of coffee.
In today's hectic lifestyle once you step through the door you will immediately realize this restaurant is beyond comparison.<//text>

<Review>A Rocklin classic for over 20 years. Even with the new owners this place still serves up reliably good breakfast and brunch that pleases any out of towners. They specialize in a multitude of eggs beneficts that are all amazing! Coffee still good, bacon still a little pricey, but still worth every penny and you will never leave unsatisfied.</Review>< gmapID>

Service was great but the Burger was not done well enough so they cut the price in half to make up the deference we will return again.</text>

<Review>Usually I love this place, but this morning changed that. Went in and got seated by the owner. Not busy at all, maybe 5 tables. Sat for 5 mins with not. Even a server looking my way when an elderly couple got seated, their order taken and drinks brought to them. Waited another 5 mins, still no service, got up and walked out, very dissapointed.<//Review>< pictures>

Blond waitress was picking her nose on 11-5. No alcoholic beverages and the meal was over 50 bucks prior to tip for 2 adults and 2 kids.< /Text>

The staff are friendly and attentive but the food was not good. I ordered the crab eggs benedict and it had to go back, not even at my request but the waitress notice that the eggs were overcooked so she took it back. When I got my plate the food it was cold, the crab cakes we're not good, the bread was not your normal sourdough English muffins but some other bread that did not go well. The Hollandaise sauce was not flavorful either. I did not enjoy the few bites I took nor will I recommend this place to anyone.< /text>

Utterly Metiocre. You go to a restaurant to pay for food and service. We didn't receive either. The food was cold and soggy over salted.  The portions were huge. However of the food is cold tasteless or over salted it is a large amount of garbage. We let them know in person ams on thwre website or disappointment. If you want quality go to high hand conservatory in Loomis. Same cost better everything.</Text>
