I have been with Personal Express Insurance for 3 years for my auto insurance, I even added my partner for his auto insurance. They go through National General Insurance. Throughout the years, I realize their system is a bit old. The website seems not friendly to use. Now a days accessibility to your information is a must. They randomly would raise the prices, we did not mind at first. Now with our home being insurance with them it we got a little disgruntled. Our house recently had major damages which required home insurance. The claims representative we had the worst customer service. It seemed like contacting them was a hassle. We would email them, call them. NO RESPONSE.

My partner and I were really frustrated at this point. We did not have a home and were staying in a hotel for months. We would got for weeks not getting an update from this claims rep. We finally decided to reach out to their manager, which helped us.

We pay all this money for insurance on our vehicles and our home. We decided to move elsewhere. It was not about the money but about the customer service for us. I would honestly recommend another company. The prices are great, but the quality/service is not great. At this point when we finally decided to move home. We switch to another insurance company.</text>

Filed a claim for water damage (sewage back up) it’s been over a week and nobody has come by as promised to look at all the damage I have piled in the back patio which includes my bed. This is my first claim with them and only my second in my life. I don’t think any insurance is really great once you file. Good luck everyone.< /text>

<username>Kristie</username><Time>1592261338728<//Time><Rate>1</Rate><review>They are great when you sign up for the first time.  Then they make changes and give you a two week notice.  When I called them to express my concern they hung up on me the first time and the 2nd time they left me on hold for 20 minutes.  I think they made this change so close to my renewal date so I would not have time to shop around.  Don't worry, I will still shop around and move my homeowners, motorcycle and auto insurance policies.  I need to be insured with a company who is going to give me the same level of service no matter if I am brand new or a customer for 5 years.  Their commercials talk about how awesome their local service is and that is a LIE!  Use extreme caution</review>< Pictures>

Prices are great til it comes to making a claim, then they ((non renew you)). They don’t work with other companies. So it easier and safer for them to cancel you.  Disappointing after many years of service til the first claim.</Review>

I have my home insured through Personal Express. I’ve not submitted a claim to them, so I can’t review their process or service in regards to that, but my homeowners insurance has just increased about $130. This is a very steep increase considering literally nothing has changed on the home and I have had no claims, but whatever. They said they had a general rate increase..... mmmm ok. Kind of feels like a bait and switch.

My rep tried to be helpful but it seems as though their management team couldn’t care less about the customer’s experience or perception of the company</Text>

<review>I wholeheartedly agree with Ian, Express is an awesome company.  I have been with them for longer than I can remember and my rep Jo Ann Miller has given me incredible service.  Since they are owned by the insurance company they know what they can and can't do so you get accurate information.  I have had several claims that were handled completely to my satisfaction.< /review>< Pics>

They had a Claims adjusting company from North Carolina represent my California Policy. They only paid $280.00 for the damaged rooftop. My local Contractor repair estimate was $1900.00. I never fought with them about it. I never even cashed the $280.00 check. Disgusted!! I know that I would lose and choose not to speak to them. It is best to do business with a better insurance company located elsewhere. I have had them for 10 years. Lousy company.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I'd give this company an indefinite -5 stars if I could.
They came highly recommended by family. I was with this company for over three years now with no problems...that is until I had a reck which I did not cause...I had full coverage...tow package and rental. Or so I thought...they towed the car and when it came to rental...they we're slow to help me...and since my vehicle was deemed a total loss. (The total loss claims adjuster is not local...like they mention over and over in their commercials.) They kindly gave me only two more days to have the rental. When I talked to the total loss claims three days ago she said my check was on it's way to me. I checked my mail and in there was a pack of forms to fill out before I can even receive my check. These forms were dated a week ago. Meanwhile, im left car less. How is this helping me? The customer that pays more money for more piece of mind?
I will never forget what they did and I'll never recommend them to anyone EVER!!!<//review>

Thanks to Yuli Bermudez for being the best agent at Personal Express. I’ve been fortunate enough. Or to have any accidents, but Personal Express Roadside Assistance has come through a couple of times for me, and because I don’t carry their phone number with me, Yuli is always available to text me their info. Thanks, Yuli, for taking care of our insurance needs.</Text>

Thanks for not being open during your posted business hours & not answering your phones & not even forwarding your phones so that I can actually get a hold of someone. Oh, and thanks for not letting me access my policy information online too. THANKS A LOT!! I'm switching to a different insurance company ASAP.... one without "the local DISADVANTAGE" that you advertise.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>I had a accident some one hit my car from the back and thanks to this insurance company I am 100% fault the reason, I don't know why. I been calling and sending msg to have a explanation but the right person never answers, I talked to some else and he told me you have to talk to the person who accepted that you were responsible for all in this case. I asked. you mean the other party? he said. no. the one who was figthing your case.
so the meant that my own insurance company accepted that I was 100% fault. finally today she answer my call the only thing she said was. I dont know how we lost this case if we have all the prove the you are not guilty in this accident im sorry but we lost. 😡
I dont recoment this insurance company to any one.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Time>1429745101232</Time><rating>2<//rating><Text>I wish I would have gone on reviews on this company before signing up with them. They are the worse company I have ever dealt with. They change their story and price so much and they lie a lot. I cancel with them and they still try and get money out of me. Needless to say it went against my credit which I fought hard to keep my credit clean. DO NOT GO WITH PERSONAL EXPRESS YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!! Once they said the price of my insurance was great then I got it in the mail and it was $30  more than what they said in the office.

Personal Express is amazing...until you actually need them.  Setting up, the occasional review of coverage, any changes the staff was kind and professional.  But if you need them they will find a way out of covering you through tricky wording.  I was hit by a car and they opened a claim, paid me very quickly for the receipts I sent in and after about a month they came back and said just kidding, you're not covered because of this and this, even though every person I talked to in their company and other insurance companies said I'd be covered.  It all boiled down to the wording that just seems like they could get out of covering you in one way or another no matter what happened.  Watch out!  You'll think you're covered when you really aren't.</Text>

No one wants to wait but the doctors are extremely good. I had a very positive experience. Who wants to go to urgent care.....like no one, right?  I am very fussy about how I am treated. This facility gave me good care very quickly. Hope you feel better!<//text>

Every time I have had to visit this facility they were of no help and sent me to pay for emergency when it wasn't an emergency situation. Now they can't even test for covid. Just  a terrible experience with lazy staff everytime. Very disappointed.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Diabetics, avoid this location!

I've been coming to Riverside Medical for my medical care ever since I was a child, many of their doctors have been excellent to have over the years, however I couldn't recommend against their urgent care center any more.

Over the phone, their receptionist is disrespectful, sighing upon answering the phone and responding to questions with a poor, dismissive attitude.

When I came in for assistance with a medical issue, the DO had no idea how to assist me with my juvenile diabetes or how to help a diabetic patient with a pump. (It's no different than injections in many ways.) Despite this fact, he had no problem prescribing a dose of 20 units of insulin - five times the amount necessary to treat my blood sugar at the time. He changed my insulin prescription in such a way that I now need to go and change it again through my endocrinologist despite the fact that an urgent care doctor shouldn't be able to do so or have any need to. Another thing, this DO seems to believe that a type 1 diabetic should be injecting 100 units per day of insulin! Thats twice as much as I take daily, bolus and basal rates included! Finally, when my blood sugar was within a reasonable range, they insisted we continue waiting until my sugars would have come down to a range which is considered low for type 1s. When I arrived home, after receiving far more insulin than required, my blood sugar was dangerously low to the point of nearly passing out.

Simply put, this place prefers fast, hands off treatment that will get you out of the door as soon as possible, damn the consequences.

All in all, I am absolutely appalled at the lack of professionalism and care at this incredibly dangerous practice.</text>

See attached pic to see the difference. Nurse practitioner or PA has about 30% of education and training as compare to physician. At the end you are paying the same co-pays then why see NP or PA. Demand to be seen by physician. they have to have physicians on site by law.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>This facility is TERRIBLE. I arrived there with my baby, who had a temperature of 101 degrees, and was not herself. The covid screener were absent, and no one around, so I went in and asked a guard inside where the urgent care checkin was. He showed me, and was surprised no one was around. I go into the waiting room and walk up to the desk, and the girl is on the phone. I say my daughter (a baby under a year old), has a fever, and it has risen a degree in the last half an hour. She barely glances at me, hands me a sign in form, and continues her call. I ask her what time it is, for the form. She answers me but continues. I had it in. She asks did I have our temperature taken. I say no. She says go through the glass doors to the that entry space and do it. I go, uncertain what’s going on. There’s no one there, just no sense of URGENT ANYTHING, nor care. This was the night before before last night. I open the glass doors on the other side, it’s going outside (clearly the other entrance), and there’s two people, a man and a woman, sitting on a bench talking. The woman looks at me and says, “bye, have a good night.” I’m like, what? I’m here to have my daughter seen; she has a fever. The lady responds, “does she have covid?” What? Firstly, do I appear to be a covid test? And secondly, i am here to see what she has. But no, no one in my home had covid, and certainly my baby does not (babies rarely are even prone to contract covid; guess these people don’t know). So she says she need to take temperature and then she says they aren’t seeing patients with temperatures. I say i need to doctor to see her. She goes inside to supposedly see the doctor, and comes out snd tells me he won’t see her, and I have to leave and call my doctor or go to the emergency room. What? Urgent care turns away babies now, that are clearly in need? So i go to google emergency room, as more time goes by. Maybe it’ll turn into an emergency now I start thinking. Good thing I left my house before it was one, and as soon as I knew it was increasing. They were incredibly unprofessional and didn’t display one ounce of care at all. Totally incompetent all of them, like I was in a third world country (which I have been at a hospital like this in Chile). What a joke for north American healthcare. I really felt like these people weren’t even healthcare professionals, but minimum wage workers covering a shift they knew nothing about. If I were deathly sick but didn’t realize it, they sure wouldn’t either and I would be waiting while she talked on the phone for a less urgent matter (telephone!) or someone else played outside. Just terrible:</review><gmapID>0x80dcb04c4ab86781:0x77f456bf412c2209</gmapID><time>1606766357393< /time>< rate>

<Review>Dr Sumit S. Bagga, MD has no compassion, is extremely unprofessional and should not be practicing medicine! I went to this urgent care yesterday after having a few good experiences with extreme abdominal pain and nausea. Dr Bagga was on duty and examined me. He gave me two over the counter medications, one of which I told him I was already taking and had no effect, and left me in the room for about 15 minutes to see if they would work. Neither medication worked. I had been diagnosed with Cannabinoid Hypermesis Syndrome and quit smoking marijuana about two weeks before my visit due to a similar illness. After explaining that I was still at a level 8 pain, Dr Bagga said that there was nothing else he could do and that I should go to an emergency room. I told him that I was at this same urgent care a week prior and they were able to get me stabilized (same issue) so he looked up my records and discovered that they had given me a narcotic (shot in my hip) for the pain. The Dr went on to tell me that he refuses to give me any narcotics because I am a narcotic addict ( marijuana use) even though I had quit weeks ago. I told him that marijuana is legal and not a narcotic and he responded with "Well then why don't you keep smoking it?" I replied by telling him that I was dehydrated and hadn't urinated for over 24 hours and he denied my claim and refused to give me any IV fluids either. After being accused of a narcotic addiction and denied treatment I became agitated and called the doctor an a**hole. He aggressively lunged toward me and said "Why don't you say that again to my face!" I was in disbelief and my dad was with me and witnessed everything. I walked away and told the front desk what happened. Their solution was to ask me for payment and have me fill out a comment form. How does this guy even have a medical license. I doubt I am the first or last person to have a horrible experience with Dr Sumit S. Bagga, MD! Beware< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Took our 84 year old mother to this Urgent Car because it was one of the few with positive reviews.   From the professional young man at the front, to the nurses and doctor(Dr. Patel) who provided my mother with life saving care, we have nothing but praise.  She was transported by two compassionate, competent, and professional EMT's from AMR to Riverside Community Hospital where she was diagnosed and admitted with significant heart failure.  We truly believe this would had been fatal if she had not been referred for further life-saving treatment.  Thank you and God Bless.  You all are doing God's work.< /review>

I went to urgent care this morning, even as bad as I felt it was a pleasant experience, from the front office to all of the assistants in the back and the RNP thank you all for excellent care.

Thank you for being so compassionate and kind. Your kindness was much appreciated.<//review>

I went to Urgent Care for a work related injury. The staff were very helpful and explained to me the process of WC as I had never been hurt on the job before and knew absolutely nothing about what to do. She got the paperwork rolling and had me in to see the Doctor within 15 - 20 minutes.
Dr. Tenenbaum was AMAZING. He asked specific and thorough questions and made eye contact the whole time! If I had a question, he took the time to explain the answer to me in layman's terms. He was very gentle and conscious that I was in a lot of pain and seemed sympathetic about it.
I have been to this Urgent Care several times in the past for more common ailments like the flu and have always been treated with courtesy and respect. The wait times do vary depending on how many people are there, but I've always been happy with my experiences.</text>

They should completely rename this place to Riverside Sloth Care. I regret going there each and every time I have to go. My only advice to you rather then waiting an eternity in a germ infested waiting room is to just stay home deal with it ie... Home remedies ect... Or make that 2 week out regular apt. with your regular physician. Save yourself the mental pain and anguish and boycott this facility.</review>

I have most usually had good experiences with this UCC - however, I'm sitting here right now waiting with my elderly mom, after arriving and letting them know my mom has shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, duzziness and back pain.

I was sick for nine months with the flu turned into bronchitis and pneumonia. I went to two different doctors at Loma Linda and nothing happened I was still sick nine months later. One week before Christmas 2017 my mother told me if I did not go to urgent care I would die that’s how sick I was. I reach there around 9 o’clock and Dr. Manoj Patel looked at me asked me if I would drive to the nearest CVS to pick up my medications and start my course Of antibiotics that same night. My antibiotic course was for 10 days I was already feeling better 2 days later and was completely cured by the 10th day. I’m really grateful to Dr. Manoj Patel for his knowledge and competency. And thank you urgent care for taking me that late. Just wanted to acknowledge the good Drs. at Riverside Medical Clinic including the front office staff.< /text>

They said they weren't refusing to see my son but because he has IEHP and he's not assigned to a Dr associated to their medical center I would have to pay out of pocket...hello I'm on medical for a reason....ridiculous!!!

She took her time and she was extremely patient with my children who are both under the age of 10. She understands the importance of building a relationship with the child and parent. She took her time cleaning their teeth and her evaluation.

I would recommend this place hands done 1000%! Great location, clean, and friendly staff. Thank you so much Dr. Cat!< /Review>< Pics>

I cannot say enough about Dr. Catherine Guerrero, My daughter woke up with a severe pain at 6:30 am in her lower left . I search for pediatric dentist on yelp and her office pop up , the front office manager was super helpful when I called in about a dental emergency and they were able to fit me in today. The most important thing about Dr cat and the tooth office was she explained everything she was doing to my child, step by step. I’ve never felt more confortable and relaxed taking my child to a dentist . Sonia , Dr .Catherine assistant was so friendly, efficient, and very patience.  THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING PROFESSIONAL, CARING AND LOVING WITH THE CHILDREN. Dr. Catherine is TRULY A GREAT PEDIATRIC DENTIST DOCTOR much love and care for you child. I will recommend this place to anyone and everyone.< /text>

We had our first dentist appointment with Dr. Cat and it could not have gone better! She is so warm and did such a great job with my 2 year old. They put his favorite show on the tv immediately after walking in and everyone had big smiles and made us feel so comfortable. Just to put things in perspective- our last doctor’s appointment was full of screaming and crying. I would definitely recommend Dr. Cat to anyone looking for a great pediatric dentist. She made his first trip to the dentist such a pleasant experience! Thanks Dr. Cat + staff.</Review>

We love Dr. Cat.  She is amazing with our two boys, who both have a gag reflex and struggle to sit still while getting their teeth cleaned.  Our boys actually enjoy going to the dentist now!  Of course,  watching Disney/Netflix while having your teeth cleaned definitely helps!<//Text>

It is always a pleasure to visit Dr. Cat and her team. She tries to keep everyone happy all day long, AND she does excellent work! She’s compassionate and understanding, and tries to stay on the cutting edge of technology.
I would recommend anyone and everyone to Dr. Catherine Guerrero and her team because they provide outstanding services. I’ve had traumatic dentist experiences in my time, and I’m no longer fear going to the dentist AT ALL.
I’m a college student pursuing to become a future dentist. Dr. Cat’s professionalism and excellence motivates me to one day be like her. An AMAZING dentist.</review>

We are so grateful we found Dr Cat! My two year old was terrified and initially cried (probably recalling last year's disaster of a first dental appointment at another practice) but quickly calmed as he realized the staff weren't going to force him to do anything he wasn't ready for. They were so gentle, friendly, warm, and patient he settled in and got thru the appointment painlessly. They allowed me to sit with him and he just leaned back and let the hygienist (who was so gentle and kind) and later the beautiful Dr Cat clean and examine his teeth. After he was done, Dr Cat educated us on dental hygiene and tooth development, and when she told us they had toys and sugar-free lollipops, my son hopped onto the ground and excitedly followed her out of the room like they'd been best friends forever! He chose his car toy, took a lolllipop, and walked out like he'd just had a fun play date. We are actually excited to come back in six months and see Dr Cat again. What a gift to have a pediatric dentist who you can tell right away she truly loves children, is warm and kind, has a great sense of humor and personality, and honors families. Highly recommend for anyone looking for their dream dentist for the kids!<//text>

Wow! This Dr and her staff are all amazing and so sweet. I’ve never had this luck where the entire office are patient and sweet. My son had three teeth extracted today and still said he loves the place. That says a lot. They are all great at explaining everything and giving visuals before procedures.</Review>

We have loved every appointment (3) we’ve had with Dr. Cat. We transferred from a different dentist office in 2020 that claimed to be pediatric and was NOT. Dr. Cat & her staff are so good with kids and every room and tool has been chosen with them in mind. I’m so very thankful and impressed.< /review>

BEST kids dentist EVER!! We went to Dr Cats for a 2nd opinion after my daughter’s regular dentist recommended general anesthesia & a ton of dental work. Dr Cats was able to get all my daughters dental work done pain free, no shots, no loud tools, no anesthesia!! Dr Cats & Ms Tish are super kind, friendly, and know how to keep a 4 year old happy & comfy while spending an entire hour in the chair!! I 1,000,000 recommended them!</text>

Wonderful pediatric dental office!!  I took my very-nervous 13-year-old daughter in for some extractions in preparation for braces, and we had the BEST experience.  Dr. Cat was SO kind, patient, encouraging.  I would highly recommend her!!</Review>

Even difficult procedures they try to make it the best experience and try to be as gentle as possible. I wish Dr. Cat could be my dentist. She is the sweetest and she makes you feel like family.

<Review>My 2yr old needed some fillings today, and the dentist was so sweet. She did her best to rally my babe, offered some toys and her favorite show, and also was RESPECTFUL about the experience. She offered to stop after the first filling since my girl wasn’t feeling it (read hysterical!) because she is little and was overwhelmed and overtired. Dr Cat stayed calm and gentle all the way the through, and that’s the best I could ask for. Kids are kids, sometimes happy, sometimes scared, but I always felt Dr Cat remained cool, confident and in control. As a bonus—the office was beautiful, nicely decorated for Halloween and so clean! Thank you!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><date>1604010769284< /date>< Name>

The dentist recommended us to a specialized children’s dentist which was Cat. Not only did our daughter absolutely love her and her staff, but she got to watch cartoons the entire time they worked on her teeth and then she got all kinds of fun stuff afterwards. Nothing can replace a happy kid after a dentist appointment that could be a super scary experience. Thank you so much to Cat and your entire team!!! We highly recommend this business.</Review></record></dataset><record>

To find a great dentist is challenging.  Dr. Cat definitely gets a 5 plus rating. Not only is she professional, she is thorough and patient! Her staff definitely know how to work well with children! The office is well maintained. I recommend Dr. Cat to anyone who has children, especially children with special needs!!<//Text>

<Review>My toddler loves Dr. Cat she is super engaging with him. However the staff needs to work on greeting people when they arrive. I have gone now three times and each time no hello, no how are you? nothing. It may be they perform multiple duties in the office such as cleaning teeth and checking people in. But a warm welcome goes along way.<//Review>< pics>

Great experience thus far. I called Dr.Cat's office to schedule an appointment and I was given a same day appointment for my 19 month old and 4 y/o. We didn't have to wait long before we were tended to and they took great care of my little ones and adjusted treatment routines for my 19 month. I really appreciated the fact that Dr.Cat and her assistant personalized care for each of my boys.<//text>

Dr Cat is truly extraordinary at caring for our littles teeth. Our 6yr old daughter has cavities between her back teeth and required a crown. dr cat offered us a number of treatment options and listened and handled our needs with sensitivity and care. Our daughter has no fear going to see dr cat as the experience is always pleasant and she takes great care to really listen to her patients (and their parents).
Best pediatric dentist - hands down!!</text>

My oldest daughter had a cavity that needed treatment and she had a panic attack when it came time for it and Dr. Cat was patient and willing to work with my daughter until she was able to relax and breathe through it. Since then my daughter can’t wait to go see Dr. Cat.

Dr. Cat has an excellent approach to her practice.  After our first visit, my 12 and 10 yr boys said she reminded them of their beloved Aunt. She was super nice and caring and thats why they felt that way.  Her diagrams and images help any parent understand the road ahead.  Dr. Cat is the best.< /Text>

There was no need to put my little girl to sleep like other Dr's suggested. She's very honest, detailed and shows empathy. My little girl watched her favorite movie and was able to raise her little hand when she needed a little break.

I'm very grateful to have found a Dr. that's so caring to the little children she treats. Thank you Dr. Cat, I wish I could give this review more than 5 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆</Review>< pictures>

I was nervous. I am a new mom and it was time for my 2 year old to see the dentist. You walk in and see a very clean and tidy waiting area, this made us feel safe since the pandemic is still going on. The receptionist was extremely kind and patient. She took our temperatures before entering the rooms. They have a cool set up where they have a screen in front of the patient chair and my son was so excited he kept asking for Peppa Pig and they had it! They were warm, friendly and allowed him to just be a kid. My son is an explorer and wanted to touch and see everything in that office and they were so kind to let him! Dr. Cat is kind, energetic and helpful. She explained how his teeth will be coming in, what to pay close attention to and how to take care of our child teeth! She answered all my questions and addressed all my concerns. The visit could not have gone better. I HIGHLY recommend this dentist.<//review>

<text>I highly recommend Dr. Cat if you’re looking for a pediatric dentist. My daughter was in pain and needed treatment. We had a bad experience at another dental office before, so I was nervous this time. I found out about Dr. Cat through my insurance. I called and they were able to schedule her the very next day in the morning! Staff and Dr. Cat were SO AMAZING!! The Dr. is so good with kids; She walked my daughter through every step of the way and made her feel beyond comfortable. That really put me at ease! Dr. Cat made the process fun for her too. She is really patient and super sweet. Staff are very friendly and helpful as well. I live about 50 minutes away from Dr. Cat’s office, but the drive was well worth it. I can’t express enough gratitude for their great service. Such a good experience!< /text>< username>

We needed a new dentist in the area and received wonderful recommendations of Dr. Cat from people in our new neighborhood.  We were not disappointed.  She’s kind and honest and really helps supply all the information you need to make a good decision for treatment.  She made my 5 year old feel at ease.  In fact, when we left she said she wanted to see Dr Cat every day!< /text>

It was a Referal from another dentist and At first after I mapquest it it was very far away so I almost cancel but this place was worth the 20 minute drive.

Omg seriously it’s the place for kids. Amazing staff. People. Dentist doctor.

Amazing office window view. Toy and a rose 🌹 they gave my son to give to his mom for Mother’s Day.

I'm so glad I found Dr. Cat. I love this office, and my kids, despite their terrible teeth, love going to the dentist. Dr. Cat takes the time to really explain the best plan for my kids' dental issues. She'll never offer unnecessary treatments and really has her patients' best interest in mind. She's gentle and patient... plus, she has popsicles, toys and stickers! What more can a person ask for in a dentist for their kids?</review>

Dr. Cat is hands down the best. My girls love coming to her for their visits. Takes her time with the kids and makes them feel comfortable and is great at explaining the treatment plan which makes us as parents feel more at ease.</Text>

My daughter was deathly afraid to go to the dentist but their staff had such a sweet and gentle approach and the individual tv screens also helped! When it turned out my daughter had cavities I thought there was no way she would cooperate however, dr cat and her team worked their magic and my daughter was able to feel at ease.< /Text>

<review>So happy with Dr. Cat and their team! I was so anxious about taking my kids (ages 2 and 3.5) to their first dental appt, but it went way better than expected! The kids were greeted with big smiles, they only did what the kids were comfortable with so they would have a good experience and fond memory of their appt, and they even handed out lollipops when they were finished (which had VEGGIES in them btw so really they are for us, right parents?) This place is a gem and we are so happy to have found it! Highly recommend.<//review>< GmapID>

<Review>Dr. Cat was so kind. She was extra patient with my 18 month old who was screaming at first but by the time we left she was a happy camper! I’m planning on bringing my older kids next time. She offers an in house dental plan that is very doable. I highly recommend her practice.

UPDATE: Is it normal for my now 3 year old to be this excited to visit her dentist?! Dr. Cat is a super star in her eyes. My older kids now 16 and 17 love her, too.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

When we went into the exam room he lost it, but was calm watching the tv they have attached to the chair - watching paw patrol. Dr cat was super friendly & helpful on information & understanding if my son didn't wanna do something.

After, she took him to go get a frisbee and toys! He had so much fun he was going behind the desk to find a new toy haha . The front desk lady was able to get us an appointment for his treatment quickly & understanding and reassuring that we were doing everything right! They gave me all the information & copies of documents for me. I love them so much!!

I will definitely be recommending dr cats office to everybody I know that has kids!! They're amazing with my son and I'm so glad I found them!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Dr. Cat is the best dentist I have ever met in my life. She is a true caring honest person that I will make the drive to see for our daughters.
We LOVE her and her kid friendly office, staff and she does her homework to help you guide making the best decision for your child. She is amazing and I pray God Bless her with just kind patients.<//Review>

My daughters and I have visited Dr. Cat two times so far and both times she's given us big, friendly hugs as if we've been seeing her for years. The office is clean, comfortable,  and welcoming. The staff is very kind and relational. Dr. Cat is great at putting young people at ease. I am grateful that each visit has been a happy,  positive experience - promoting in my children a willingness and excitement to go to the dentist for preventative care.< /text>

<Review>Dr. Cat and her team wonderful work! They’re so nice and understanding, they never pressure my son to do anything he doesn’t want to do. They take they’re time explaining and waited for him to get comfortable. We very much enjoy going to Dr. Cat and you will too!

Update: we took our 2 year old to Dr. Cat for her first dentist appointment. It was ridiculously easy. Even with all the COVID changes. It was still a great experience, with a positive attitude, and no parent shaming. And of course they never forget treats for the kids, nor the parking validation for the adults.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I have two children who go to this dentist and Dr. Cat and her staff are absolutely amazing!  From cleanings to fillings they always make the kids feel comfortable and explain everything very well.  I am so sad our insurance no longer carries this office.  I will be recommending them to everyone!<//Review>

I took my 9 year old and 12 year old to Dr. Cat yesterday. By far, it was one of the most pleasant dental visits we've had! I worked in the dental field for 15 years, so I know a good office when I see one! My kids loved the staff and Dr. Cat. Coming from our previous office where we only felt like we were dollar signs, it was a breath of fresh air to come to a dentist who not only actually cared and took time to talk to my kids! Would recommend this office to any of my family and friends, and my sister will now be taking her kids there as well!< /text>

<rating>5</rating><review>This office is absolutely wonderful! Sonia, the dental hygienist, kindly explained each tool and step of the process to us and our two year old. She allowed our daughter to familiarize herself with the dentals tools to put her toddler fears at ease. Throughout the process, Sonia cleaned our daughter’s teeth quickly and efficiently. Dr. Cat struck the optimal balance of being professional and thorough while simultaneously exuding gentleness and kindness in her approach. Dr. Cat and her staff clearly care about their patients, their dental care, and their comfort level in this office. My husband and I both agree that we are thrilled to have found such a gem in Dr. Cat and the Tooth!< /review>< pictures>

<text>The hygienist and Dr. Cat were very patient since my son wasn’t to keen on having half his month cleaned. They just kept trying different ways to encourage him to let them finish. Everyone is always very sweet and friendly in the office. I’m glad we found you guys.<//text><user>118445167954173881876<//user>< Name>

<review>Dr. Cat was amazing and very patient with my daughter, as well as the staff and the lady at the front desk. My daughter got X-rays, a cleaning, and a tooth extraction. I was very worried that it would be a traumatizing experience, like when I took her to Western Dental to get work done. My daughter felt at ease and comfortable with Dr. Cat. The dental office had a TV for the kids in every room, so that they can be distracted and watch a show when they get work done. My daughter also played with the toys in the waiting room. She loved this dental office so much, that she hugged Dr. Cat after her dental procedure. I was very pleased, and I will be coming here from now on.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c29c217046e7ab:0xe5c9ea703de4a344< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Took my 2 year old daughter and 6 year old son to Dr Cat today and they handled my son so well. He was a little apprehensive but they calmed him and handled him with such compassion and care! My daughter had no fear and both enjoyed there experience in the office. The staff and Dr. Cat are fabulous, the office is so clean and kid friendly with toys in the waiting room and a treasure chest of rewards for the kids after there exam. I highly recommend Dr. Cat.</Text>

Let me just first start off saying that Dr. Cat and her staff are simply amazing and the best pediatric dental office by far.  It's no wonder she has a 5 ⭐ review from 100's of patients.  Devyn did well for his 1st dental visit and had 0 cavities. Dr. Cat and staff welcomed my 2 year old and played with him while I was filling out paperwork and he enjoyed them so much.
Afterward,  he enjoyed his all natural,  sugar free,  veggie/fruit lollipop with a big smile. 🍭 😍😘< /Text>

<Text>ABSOLUTELY HANDS DOWN THE BEST PEDODONTIST IN THE VALLEY! I was a dental assistant years ago and she made myself and my son (5 yrs old) feel completely at ease.  Dr. Cat was amazing as well as her staff! She is truly something special and I will recommend her to anyone in need of a dentist for their children.  From the phone call with Renee I felt comfortable bringing my son in and it was a 5 star treatment start to finish! Thank you Dr. Cat we will see you soon!<//Text>< user_name>

Dr. Cat and her crew are amazing. Each of my three girls have some difficulties trusting others, but over time (4 years now) they have no problems getting their teeth cleaned. Dr. Cat has the greatest amount of respect and patience for both children and parents. Her staff has been great at encouraging my girls to be brave through teaching them about the tools and what procedure will be done. I love when adults treat my children as smart learners. We also got great advice on all the insurance policies offered. I would highly recommend Dr. Cat.< /Text>

Dr. Cat was very caring. She took her time to explain things to me in details and did not rush us and answered all my questions. It was my first visit there, my daughter's face was swallown. She did all the necessary tests that needed to be done. After we left her office, the next day she called me personally to follow up, which meant a lot to me.<//text>

Dr. Cat was absolutely amazing and the staff was perfect. My six year was very nervous about her appointment and everyone in the office made her feel so comfortable. From the waiting room to the exam room, everything was very clean and well maintained. The staff even made me feel comfortable. The dentist is usually a dreaded place but this office was nothing short of excellent. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a safe and pleasant office for their children.<//text>

<Text>Dr. Catherine Guerrero and her staff are amazing people. The moment we walked in the room, it was an instant of welcoming and loving environment. My son suffers from anxiety and he does not do well in medical or dental offices. He will not let anyone near his mouth, however, Dr. Guerrero and her staff were able to make my son feel very comfortable and at ease. They give hope and really do care about their patients and will not do anything that would scare them. I feel more comfortable that my son is more open to dental work. We are grateful that we were recommended to Dr. Guerrero’s office.   :D</Text>< Date>

Dr. Cat is so good with our son. He’s nine and autistic - he needs to take breaks and everyone handles his needs with sensitivity and expertise.  He had a great visit and is learning to enjoy his trips to the dentist!  That’s a big accomplishment.</review>

Dr. Cat and her staff are fantastic! My 6-year-old was nervous about his appointment, but left asking if he could go again tomorrow! He’s disappointed that he has to wait a whole 6 months to go back! Lol!
The staff and Dr. Cat did a great job comforting my son while giving him a thorough exam and cleaning. Dr. Cat was so warm and inviting, and took special care to discuss my son’s dental health with both my son and me (even explaining with comparison photos for reference, which was helpful).
The office is VERY clean and decorated very cute. We absolutely loved our experience with Dr. Cat and her team!< /Review>

My almost 5 years old son had been a patient of Dr. Cat for the last 8 months and has been very pleased with the care she and her stuff provide. Yesterday I told him that we are going to visit Dr. Cat, he was so excited he told everyone that day that he is going to see his dentist! Thank you Dr. Cat for taking care of us so well!</Text>

I found Dr Cat through research I made online and I'm so happy I found such a wonderful Dr. My daughter felt so comfortable in her office that is very clean and smells good ( was important for my daughter) she took care of my daughter so well she always smiles and so patient and very very professional!! My daughter had 2 major procedures which took more than 2 hours ea h time and also cavity and Dr Cat was beyond expectations. Her staff is great too and very helpful.
My daughter had some bleeding after treatment and Dr Cat gave me her private cellphone to call for any problem any time and you know she means that. Sbe always hugs us and give us worm feeling so my daughter has no problem going there even when she knew the procedure won't be that easy...Really wonderful Dr and staff We love her and  had great experience!!</Text>

Dr. Cat Guerrero is so wonderful. Our family is so blessed to have found her. My kids actually love going to the dentist now. She is very caring, nurturing, and knowledgeable. The entire staff is so sweet and helpful, and we’ve never had a long wait. We love Dr. Cat!!!<//text>

<text>Let me start by saying my son 3 1/2 years old and is not an easy child.  He overheard me discussing his upcoming appointment earlier in the week and he already started having a fit about going even though he had never been before.  This is why I was blown away by how WONDERFUL his first experience was at the dentist and can’t thank Dr. Cat and her team for making my son feel so welcomed, having such an amazing environment for him to feel at ease, explaining everything to him in a fun way, letting pick out his favorite flavor of toothpaste for his cleaning, putting on his favorite Netflix kids show, allowing me to sit in the chair with him for the first part of his appointment. I mean we just had the most amazing experience that by the end of the visit my son said DR. CAT WAS HIS BEST FRIEND as we got in the car.  I really feel that they set him up for success for future visits and his dental health.  We can’t wait to go back.< /text><userid>103912496070126234026<//userid><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>Esmeralda Cano</user_name>< gmap_id>

Dr Cat and her associates were so great with my kids. Both my 6 and 9 year old felt comfortable and safe the entire time. She cleaned their teeth, did X-rays, put sealant on their molars, and had to get rid of a tiny cavity. I felt like she was knowledgeable, and genuinely cared about my kids wellbeing and dental health. She took her time with explaining what was happening, how to take the best care of their teeth and it was an overall great experience for both my kids and myself.</review>

I mean... I don’t think I could love a dentist any more than I love Dr Cat! We have been seeing her since my 7 year old was 3, and she has always had such a welcoming, easy going presence that my nervous daughter now looks forward to going (to the dentist!). I recommend the office very highly.</Review>

Dr. Cat was extremely warm, approachable, and gentle with my 2.5 year old (and me).  Magically, she got her excited to come back to get her tooth filled!  Based on our initial visit, we will definitely be visiting Dr. Cat again!<//text>

<review>I never do the comments on these things but I have to this time because the doctor and her staff are Amazing! I took my son there to get his teeth worked on and he was really nervous and hates going to the dentist because of a previous bad experience he had at another office. The doctor and her staff were so informative, nice and caring. They really took the time to make sure my son was doing ok and comfortable the entire time we were there and I am very pleased with the work that was done on his teeth. When we left Doctors Cats office my son was happy and wanted to go back the following week.< /review><user_id>117118959476781952201</user_id><name>Joe Smith</name>< Resp>

<text>Always the best. Felt very safe with check in procedures, we were notified to come up from the car when the office was clearer and dental chair ready for my son. Dr Cat Is always impeccable, we have gone for 3 years now, she helps us get everything done when I have the day off work.

Dr. Catherine is really terrific. She makes the experience fun and does not try to rush any procedures that your child may not be ready for. Her motto is "if he or she will let me". That creates a trust that is crucial in childrens dentistry. I highly recommend Dr. Cat and her staff, your kids will love them.</Text>

We had our 1st dentist visit ever and my twins did great thanks to the extremely friendly staff and Dr. Cat. Amazing all around. The kids were anxious and excited going in and even more excited when we were done. They said it was FUN! :) Quick, comfortable, efficient visit; Clean bill of dental health, lots of bright shiny smiles and we will definitely be going back! I couldn't be more happy with the experience my kids (age 3) had today with Dr. Cat.< /text>

Dr. Cat is the best! I followed her from another office because she was the best dentist there and when she was gone I knew I had to track her down. I’m so thrilled I found her new office. My 6 year old son had a bad fall and needed help with his injury and Dr. Cat has been patient, understanding and so loving with him. And she’s been amazing with me when I was frustranted and didn’t understand why certain procedures had to be done. I’m so pleased with her and her work.<//review>

Depends on the assistant. The dentist is amazing. She listens to your concerns as well as diagnosing and treating efficiently. Very friendly. Very critical. It seems that her office also trains dental technicians. Could be a good thing to properly train new technicians. Her office staff is amazing. Could also be a bad thing if the parent/guardian is not present. I advise staying with your child while with an unfamiliar face. The dental assistant might be new and has not learned all the amazing tricks of the office yet.< /Text>

Dr. Cat Guerrero is the best pediatric dentist I have ever met. She's very loving, caring, fun and mostly she's very sweet with the kids, she explains the procedure  step by step so they know what to expect and not be scared. Her staff is very polite and helpful... I highly recommend her... 5 🌟's  for her 😁👍< /review>

After a pretty scary dental experience as a child, I was worried for my 5 year old when she starting getting cavaties, despite our best efforts. Dr. Cat came highly reccommended, and I can definitely see why. My 5 year old, who is very shy and on the spectrum, was excited about the toys in the waiting room, and felt comfortable enough to start playing from the get go. The staff was incredible. Despite being a child who never leaves her momma, my little girl felt comfortable enough and loved the staff enough to go back to her room by herself while I took care of an insurance issue. The absolute highlight was Dr. Cat. From the moment she entered the room, it was like a ray of sunshine walked in. My daughter was immediately at ease some some sort of magic, and was happy to go along with whatever she suggested. Dr. Cat made things so easy to understand, and when i was feeling terrible for my little girl's situation, she really put me at ease and explained how there are so many factors that we cannot control that lead to these things, and even gave me a hug when I got teary eyed with relief. Everyone had great things to say as bout my little girl, which made us both feel so loved and accepted. And everyone went above and beyond for the best customer service I have had since we moved to Cali 4 months ago.

If you are worried about your child, please consider Dr. Cat. I've never felt more comfortable or at peace over someone taking care of my little girl. ♡♡♡</Review>

<Review>So glad we found this place! Dr. Cat is amazing. My son was not a fan of his first dentist and Dr. Cat made him feel at ease. She is very warm and caring. The staff is always super friendly, welcoming and professional.  The office has a very comfortable feel vs. a doctor office. The waiting room has a good selection of toys to keep the kids entertained. Actually nice and unbroken toys! (The last place we went had overly nasty broken toys) The exam/patient rooms have TV's with Netflix so the kids can watch anything they want. Which in my mind is a total plus.<//Review>< pics>

Dr Cat & her amazing staff have made going to the dentist something my 6 year old looks forward to—even after fillings! They do everything with your kid’s comfort in mind. They get to choose what they want to watch on tv while they get their teeth done, what flavors they want for the polish (they have cool flavors like marshmallow), & afterwards they get to choose a toy. Everyone is so kind & gentle here. I’m so glad we lucked out & found this place! 😊</review>

My son ended up needing to see a specialist and she took the time to call around to find one who would see him and take our insurance.

This was the most amazing dental office I've ever been to. My son, 2.5 years, was so happy the whole time, the staff made him feel comforable and didn't make this a scary first dental visit. High reccomend this office! Dr. Cat was AMAZING and so personable!! We've found our lifelong Dentist!<//review>

If anyone is looking for a Professional and child friendly environment, the Dr Cat is the women you need to see. Dr Cat and her staff are 1st class. When you schedule a appointment, thats it! No waiting 30mins and then your child is seen. Clean office space and our very knowledgeable staff help you feel relaxed. I have recommended her to lots of friends. And I am not the type of person to refer or vouch for anyone! Dont take my word for it. Check them out for yourself.</Review>

First  took him to teddy bear  dentistry in West Hills  and when he was not Cooperative they ended up holding him down  asking me to quiet him down because he was scaring the patients  so I stopped  the appointment  and they decided not to charge me due to the negative experience. I then decided to take him to my dentist dr. Gregory Turk who has worked on my teeth for over 13 years so that hopefully him knowing them would help the situation however it did not so they referred me to dr. Cat. The office of dr. Cat was able to get everything done without him having anxiety once he meet the employees and dr.. They made it a magical moment talking about fair dust. Which was a powder they state with his daily toothpaste. My son is very particular about his toothpaste and will only use one particular kind so I thought it would be helpful to bring it and they were able to use that toothpaste mixed in that powder to clean his teeth.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

OMG these woman are angels. Dr. Cat is a dream come true. My son is dying to go back and see the whole staff. Thanks again for making an unpleasant situation into an I forgettable experience.</Text>

< Review>
UPDATE: I came back to get one of my nails fixed, the whole nail came off with the dip less than two weeks after I got them done. The girl in charge asked me to pay. I was very upset because I’ve been going to this place for over 3 years and I have NEVER seen them charge anyone for a broken nail.

I love this place! My nails came out really nice and the staff is always so nice and accommodating. I felt really safe during COVID, everyone were wearing masks and they had additional dividers in each station.<//Review>

<text>I love my nails, they did a great job for what they are working with. Very ingenious the way they are making it work. I appreciated them dumping my unused powder, from gel dip, in the trash and not using it communally. However the 4 star is because I was charged the same price for a outside wash tub pedicure as I would habe in a massage chair with warm water and jets. But hey you gotta do what you gotta do in these times I guess.</text>< gmapID>

Not happy with service. I had a man do my pedicure and it was not sufficient in my book. Half done. I usually bring my own polish but this was a spare of the moment decision. He would not talk or even look at me. Totally unfriendly. I asked if he would please cut nails shorter, he shook his head at me, like I was bothering him. Then I asked politely after he did one toe, if he would use the other color. Again he shook his head at me, like I was causing too much trouble
The girl that did my nails , no conversation but did a good job. I felt very unappreciated. Not going back! 09/11/2020.</review>

Two stars for their pre-COVID services- friendly, good work on nails. Went today and it was a poor attempt at nail service. Made an appointment via phone on Monday for a Wednesday 10AM- had to wait 30 minutes. When I was finally called by a nail tech, she walked over to me, rudely ripped a pen out of my hand (given to me by the manger to sift through the samples to avoid touching), threw the pen on the table. I explained to her that he had given it to me to safely examine the samples, she asked if I knew what color I wanted, I turned to look at the number, and she hollered something and sat someone else. In addition, after asking for a color by number for my daughter, the wrong color was put on. Techs are under lots of pressure to "go go go" (managers words, not mine), however there are plenty of nail salons in Camarillo so I can avoid rude nail techs under pressure.< /Text>

<text>Let me start off by saying this review is not out of hate. It’s out of major disappointment.

The same employee named Vin who gave me a set price over the phone, a day prior to my appointment, was unbelievably rude and unprofessional towards me when we discussed a hidden fee face to face that he didn’t disclose over the phone. They were charging more to shape my nails coffin shape. The phone conversation was detailed. I say detailed because  explaining exactly what services I needed and going over covid policies is detailed.

When I got there, Vin’s demeanor in person was WAY OFF. In front of all his customers. It was like he was offended that I would question the discrepancy.

Price wasn’t the main issue though. This salon does charge $20 more than other salons, including the one I originally go to called Top Nails in Oxnard. But my regular nail place has yet to open due to Covid. So I had to settle for this place. I’ve been here, to Encore, about twice in the past, it became my last resort. They didn’t charge for shaping the previous times I came.

I understand these are horribly hard times for many but come on.

Here’s the story.
I called this place to make an appointment so my 25-30 minute drive wouldn’t be pointless. But in contrary, I had my worst nail salon experience ever, before even sitting down.

On the phone Vin asked to specify what service I needed and was given a price of $92  for a full set gel nail and pedicure gel nail. He said to bring cash, they weren’t accepting cards (weird, but ok).

When I got there, the price given was $97. Not that big of a deal right? I agree. Five $ more, no biggie. But the price agreed upon was in cash, they were not excepting cards. I had limited bills on me. Plus, I trusted that man’s word. That’s what was pitiful. The lack of honor. The rude behavior and his gross pride.

As a business, you either honor the price you made a mistake on or you at least acknowledge your mistake and handle the situation to the best of your ability. At least ask for the dispute to be moved AWAY from your customers. You’re outside (business was being conducted outside- cool), there’s plenty of room. Business ethics. Respect.

Plain and simple. Be CLEAR and HONEST with your customers. If you forgot to disclose fee over phone, THAT’S OK, just acknowledge that and move on. I could have gone to the bank, which would have been out of my way, but I would have done that, just to give a proper tip. But to disregard the comfort of your other customers over your ego? Over $5? That cost the business $97 x 3 because my two friends decided not to do business here after what had happened.

I’ve been getting my nails done for almost 15 years. I’ve been lucky to have been to several excellent nail spots. But when your spot is closed and other great salons near by are closed, you gotta go with what’s available. Never to this place again though.</text>< pics>

< Review>
I went in with my friend and I, to get a simple gel manicure. we were asked to be seated with little conversation. a young lady asked me if I had wanted my nails cut, but I had said no. it was clear my nails were uneven in the length and when she asked if I wanted them I cut I thought she had meant short to the nub not just a little clip. when I told her to make all my nails even she seemed to have gotten a bit of attitude with me. and was blaming me for saying I didn’t want them cut. she made it a big deal that she had to clip one of my nails, and said something under her breath. she later became to be VERY aggressive with my nails and seemed to have want to rush my manicure. very upsetting and would not go back</Review>

<Review>Honestly this place is very hit or miss, recently it’s been a miss.  And after today I’ve decided to find another nail salon. The last time my nails were cut longer than I asked, this time she didn’t even let me confirm the length before cutting them too short. I thought to myself that they’d grow out and be fine, but as I was in my car I looked closer and realized they’re just a mess regardless of the length. They’re so bumpy that it’s the first thing my husband noticed when I showed him. Because they were cut too short the tech told me I couldn’t have them tapered and now they look almost flared out and just ugly. Getting them fixed elsewhere. The technician was very nice, but I should not have paid for this service.</Review>< userid>

<Review>If I could  give this place ZERO stars I would. Horrible customer service and staff is very unprofessional and very disrespectful. I would not recommend this place at all. My 13 year old daughter went to get full set gel coffin tip nails was very unhappy and told the nail lady several time they were too short and too thick but lady told her in the beginning oh well there’s nothing I can do. But she sure did charge her $45.</Review><pics>None< /pics><user>115580754193918812799<//user>< Time>

My experience was amazing even if it was last minute they attended me and they where super friendly. Did my nails in 30 minutes very fast but very professionally done. I loved them. They are very clean and prices are very reasonable for an amazing experience. I will be going back soon 👌🏼💕< /Review>

<Text>I have had acrylic nails for many, many years. I took a chance and stopped in for a fill at a new salon because my previous nail salon has ignored my appointment times and made me wait too many times for too long. Finally I had it with them and made a change. What a surprise!! My nails are beautiful. They are perfect.
Encode is my new nail spa. Thanks Mindy< /Text><gmap_id>0x80e8361d8f068157:0x737c98a2e0b89431<//gmap_id>< name>

< Review>
We were greeted and asked what services we wanted.  My partner asked for a traditional manicure, and was told the only manicure they do is gel.  She did not want to argue, so she agreed. She also asked to have nails trimmed short and not have cuticles cut, the nails were kept long and only filed, and the cuticles were cut.  There were three staff in attendance, one young woman who appeared to be an owner or manager. Nobody spoke a word the entire time. It was rather eerie given the fact that there is usually some kind of dialogue going on between the technicians and the clients and the staff between themselves....
My pedicure which was the traditional spa pedicure included the basics but no Calles work on the heels. They wanted to up charge me $12 for that and I passed.
We visit many nail salons on the East and West coasts, and feel that this is definitely not worth the 4.6 stars that were given to it when we had our service.  Maybe it's just an off day, but the demeanor of the owner basically spelled everything out.</Review>

<review>Too high for fill in charge 38. For fill in + polishes are watered down gooey wont dry without smudges ( i also had to go to paris nails and get a polish change immediately after) because encore has no non-yellowing top coat, for those who wear surgical gloves and work in lasers- it's a must.  not nice either.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

It was my first time going there this weekend and it was a nice place and it was very relaxing. I did a mani pedi and the pedicure was great but unfortunately i was not impressed with my request upon a french tip acrylic manicure. It was so uneven that i had to keep correcting her to fix the crookedness of my nails. When i left i was slightly disappointed. . Sweet girl, so of course i tipped her. Honestly, it was such a waste of $40.<//text>

<text>I haven’t taken any classes yet so this review is going to be based solely on what I have seen, researched, and my conversations with them.

Google says that they respond back in a day normally, lately it’s been more then a day but besides that it’s good. The people I chat with are friendly the amount of time you get to finish the classes are ridiculous in a good way for those that need a while to complete it. The reviews I have seen and compared are hard to compare, classes only range from 60 to just under 100 USD each, they even have a bit of something for everyone. They even make everything so easy. In summary I am yet to find a reason to not go to them there competitors can’t even stand up to these standers let alone my own standers I had set. Oh did I mention no matter where in the World you live they have a class for you? That’s right they do. While I haven’t taken any of the classes I have to say...

<Review>Ms. Mae and the amazing coaches at 3-2-1 Acting Studios have made a permanent impression on my 10-year old son, who "found" acting as what appears to be a calling over a year ago.  Given the limited opportunities to explore his newfound craft due to the pandemic and the urgent need to find him a creative outlet, we researched virtual acting studios and came upon Ms. Mae and 3-2-1 Acting Studios.  Almost immediately after beginning classes at 3-2-1, the sparkle in my son's eye returned.  He couldn't wait to attend his bi-weekly classes, learn the scripts assigned, and engage with his coaches and classmates.  After several weeks, Ms. Mae invited him to join her career acting program, and a few months later, he signed with a top talent agent and manager.  We live in a midwest State with few opportunities for professional actors.  Ms. Mae and her crew made my son's dream a reality, and we will forever be grateful to her and her incredible staff (especially Aidan) for encouraging our son to pursue his dreams.  They have forever changed the course of his life.  If you are at all hesitant to try 3-2-1 Acting Studios, don't be!  You will not regret it!  It was the best choice we ever made!  Thank you, 3-2-1 Acting Studios, for giving our precocious, charismatic 10-year old the opportunity of a lifetime!</Review>< rating>

I signed up both my kids (age 4 & 6) into 3-2-1 Acting Studios back in May 2019. From the initial first phone conversation with the office manager to their first class I was completely blown away. Each member of the studio has their own role and responsibilities and are great at what they do! The acting teachers are all acting professionals and work really well with kids. My kids enjoy the time they spend in class and sometimes don't even want to leave. The best part of the classes are the playbacks at the end. This gives parents the opportunity to see what the kids did in class.

We were invited to join the talent showcase and acting career program and we were walked through the entire process and taught everything that we needed to know in this industry. Following the showcase we were able to sign with one of the talent agencies that attended.

Ms. Mae who is the owner of the studios is truly the real deal! She has the experience and knowledge to get you to where you want to be. Her studio is ran in a very professional manner and everyone is always so friendly and with a positive attitude. You can truly see her passion in her studio and when she works with the kids.< /text>

Everyone who works there is the absolute best. Isabella did the Showcase program and all i have to say is, the whole experience was so much fun and I'm sure she would do it all over again. She is the most confident little girl in the world after everything we've done with 3-2-1- and as a parent i couldn't be happier. Thank You all so much!< /Review>< user_id>

<text>3-2-1 Acting Studios is truly the best! My daughter absolutely loves coming here and always has so much fun. Her acting skills have grown so much! She's more confident and really has found a passion for acting. The teachers there are so great and PATIENT with the kids. They are very warm and loving, but also push the kids to get the best out of them. We attended the 321 career showcase and this was a big game changer for our daughter. She received many calls and finally got signed with one of LA's top talent agencies!!! Ms. Mae and the team guided us throughout the whole process. They taught us, as parents, how to go through selecting an agent that was right for us, as well as the steps and procedures we need to take to make sure we are all set. Thank you 321!!!</text>< gmap_id>

321 Acting has been such a blessing, the teachers and staff really care about the students and give 100% I just took the acting career program and could not recommend more. It was everything I needed to feel confident and kick start my acting career. I loved that the program really prepared you to be a professional actor, with the business side of it too. There are not many programs like this, and 321 Acting went to above and beyond in their career program. Another valuable experience I have encountered is the positivity, and warmth I feel from everyone. It could not be a more encouraging place to learn and grow from. Everyone is a winner here!<//text>

321 acting studios is a great place for kids to develop confidence and skills to interact with others. We start from regular acting class and move on to showcase class. The whole experience is wonderful, for both kids and parents. I can tell my little one learn so many skills that will definitely be positive not just in finding commercial opportunities, but also in his whole life. Ms Mae, Alejandra, Aidan and the whole staff are wonderful. They really make the whole acting experience superb.</Review>

My son has been going to 3-2-1 Acting for over a year now. He joined Ms. Mae’s showcase program and since then has booked three commercials! The whole team at 3-2-1 is really invested in the children and genuinely wants the best for them. Ms. Mae holds your hand throughout the process and teaches you everything you need to know and is always available to give you her advice and expertise. Thanks to 3-2-1 acting, he’s become more confident and creative and the whole experience has really added something new and exciting to our lives! Thank you everyone at 3-2-1!< /review>

< Review>
This is the best school in Los Angeles, Mrs. Mae and her staff are fantastic. They take the time to know every student not only by name, but by their abilities, talents, their family, interests, etc.  They help every student to give their full potential. We have found in this school the professionalism, guidance and commitment to the students that no other school in Los Angeles were able to provide for us. My daughter was part of the last showcase in January 2017, and it was an Amazing experience. The preparation, the guidance, the seminars to parents, what to expect, the individuality, their choice of audition material, and all the attention to detail and professionalism from the beginning to the end it was just Spectacular!.  Thank you so much!! :)</Review>

Ms. Mae and her staff are extremely talented and caring, and always encourage students to push through their perceived limits to learn new skills.

They truly make each student feel special & cheer them on for each & every accomplishment.

The Talent Showcase is definitely a one of a kind opportunity.  My son joined the Showcase a few months after starting at 3-2-1 & it was incredible to watch his confidence grow.  The classes gave him tons of on-camera experience & personalized attention to help with his acting.  He had pictures taken by a top photographer & Ms. Mae helped w/ all of the styling for the photo shoot.  With her expert guidance he ended up with an amazing portfolio.  Ms. Mae also gave a really informative seminar for the parents to help answer any questions about getting started in the industry.  After the Showcase, my son signed with a top L.A. talent agency.  He recently booked an international modeling campaign & we know it never would have happened without 3-2-1!< /Text><UserId.>104657072338391545105< /UserId.><time>1393702735803< /time></record></dataset><record>

Are you looking for a great acting school for your children? Look no further, 3-2-1 Acting Studio is your answer! Ms. Mae has done a great job in building this company to be one of the go-to studios for top talent agents in the industry. She and her staff are very friendly that makes you feel like your a part of the family right in the beginning. They will guide you through out the process of starting to act to making acting your child's career.

My son started attending their classes for the purpose of gaining experience and building his confidence in front of the camera.

It was not always smooth. In his first few classes, we could tell that he needs a lot of work. As time went by and with the help and guidance of their amazing teachers, my son became comfortable and improved... a lot! My son would always look forward to going to his classes, meet his friends, and learn new techniques to improve his craft!

After his Showcase, where the kids would perform their assigned scripts in front of the top talent agents, my son received multiple callbacks from the agents! We were very excited!

My wife and I are very happy that we found this place! From no experience to being contacted by talent agents! Ms. Mae and her staff have done a great job in supporting, guiding, and training my 10 year old son to be successful to start his acting career. My child's improvement is a testimony to other parents who want their kids to be successful in their acting career!

Thank you Ms. Mae and company!</review>

Our family got a chance to go to a free class at 3-2-1 Acting Studios and it was an incredible experience.  The staff was very pleasant and extremely helpful with information.  They welcomed my daughter into the class.  She had so much fun.  I got to watch on playback what she did for the evening and was very impressed.  We are currently in the process of trying to find the right class for my daughter and she told me that this is where she wants to take her classes.  It's a great testimony when your child has a great experience and wants to go back.  Thank you to all of the team at 3-2-1 for our wonderful experience.  We can't wait to come back.< /review>

3-2-1 Acting Studios is truly home. I have never stepped inside of a more peaceful, professional, classy and unbelievable environment in my entire life. I truly recommend 3-2-1 Acting Studios. If one really wants to know how to get into acting and learn absolutely everything that there is to know about how one should act, searching for agents, learning how to handle multiple scripts and making them your own, come to 3-2-1. Working with Cheryl Texiera, Ron Morehouse, Guy Nardulli, Ms. Mae and Aidan Rees  has truly been a dream and I am beyond grateful for all they have taught me.< /Text>

They welcomed my daughter into the class.  She had so much fun.  I got to watch on playback what she did for the evening and was very impressed.  We are currently in the process of trying to find the right class for my daughter and she told me that this is where she wants to take her classes.  It's a great testimony when your child has a great experience and wants to go back.  Thank you to all of the team at 3-2-1 for our wonderful experience.  We can't wait to come back.< /Text>< Pics>

I want to thank Ms. Mae and her staff for all of the work that they do at 321 Acting Studios. They are "Top Notch" in my book! My daughter is a current student at 321. I am very please with what she is learning at 321. From day one I felt welcomed by Ms. Mae and her warm and friendly staff. So much so that I am willing to transport my daughter a hour to sometimes over a hour to get to her class. That is how good they are at 321 Acting Studios! If you are looking for acting classes to take, make sure to add 321 to your list!<//review>

This is a legitimate business with the owner, Mae Ross, having the expertise and experience in the acting business of guiding you and your child throughout the whole acting process.

If you are selected and elected to participate in their Showcase program, their staff is super in providing additional support in terms of providing wardrobe advice, portfolio photography, interviewing techniques and agent contacts.

My child is enrolled in the class and loves it!!</review>< rate>

Well what can I say my experience with Miss Mae was mutually beneficial and it really shows her dedication to the craft of acting and helping children achieve their dreams.  I got nothing but positive energy from all the staff, and I was impressed with the cleanliness of this facility. I have no doubt that my son will become a star!<//Text>

When I started looking for a studio for my daughter, I researched and called at least 6 other studios. I can tell you hands down from the first contact 321 was and is the best. Alejandra was amazing on the phone, she answered all of my questions and I had quite a few lol! She followed up with me in a timely manner and was always kind and professional. The first point of contact is always so important to any business and Mae couldn't have choose a better person for the job than Alejandra! On our first visit we got a tour, Mae took the time to sit down with us, and gave us some insights to the industry. Mae was very welcoming and warm! Truly everyone at 321 are amazing! Everyone from the instructors to our point of contact for showcase, to the receptionist are amazing. My daughter just did a showcase this last Saturday and we've received emails from two different agencies that want to meet with us! They truly prepared my daughter and made sure that she had everything in place to have a great showcase. I can't thank Mae and her staff enough for everything they have done not only to prepare my daughter but also to prepare me! They provided the parents with crucial insightful information about the industry. Mae and her staff are truly a blessing in our life! We can't thank them enough!</Text>

<review>We are originally from Kiev, Ukraine and we were in LA for work this past summer. 3-2-1 Acting Studio was recommended to us through a friend who works in the industry and I have to say, she was right on the money!
Our daughter who was 8 at the time was so happy we have found Miss Mae and her team!
Being that she is a native Russian and Ukrainian speaker and that English is her 3rd language, feeling comfortable in a new and foreign environment can understandably be hard, but with the help, support & warmth of Miss Mae's team who made her feel at home she just loved coming to classes!
the way they make each class fun was so amazing and inspiring that our little one requested she goes back this winter when we were in LA again for a month and a half.
She can't wait for another opportunity to be in LA and attend more classes!<//review><user_name>Tanya R</user_name><userid>113654023984611079608</userid>< Rate>

<Review>3-2-1 Acting School has been an amazing experience for both my son and my daughter. They look forward to Wednesdays (their class day) all week. All of the employees are so nice and really go the extra mile to answer any questions that you might have. If your kids are interested in acting or if you want to learn more about "the biz" and don't know where to begin, this is the place. Ms. Mae the owner is such a beautiful, kind soul. She is so sweet with the kids and teaches them so much. She really makes it fun. My kids just finished the showcase program last Saturday and have already been contacted by multiple agents. I feel like 3-2-1 has prepared the kids for the next step if their acting career. We drive almost 2 hours each way weekly to come to class and it is absolutely worth it! Special thanks to Ms. Mae, Ms. Francis, Holly, and Natasha!!< /Review><Name>Mendy Leyendecker< /Name><gmap_id>0x80c2ea5483fd3acb:0x998f2ee8f90cf7a1</gmap_id>< rate>

I am not one to write reviews very often, but the experience we have had and continue to have at 321 Acting Studios has been something that must be passed on to others! Without making this too long to read, I want to start out by saying that my 8 year old daughter has been attending classes at 321 for over a year now, and it has changed her life! She has not only learned skills to improve her acting ability and to get her to the next level, but  has also learned real life skills that have built her self confidence, concentration, and even expanded her imagination! The team at 321 treat us like family, and have spent a lot of one on one time with us to make sure we exceed in other path to success. They have gone above and beyond in their services that have more than exceeded our expectations. We couldn't have asked for anything better. Thank you to everyone at 321, especially Mae and Aidan, for everything you have done for us. We are forever grateful for you and to 321 Acting Studios.<//Review>

<Text>We have had a wonderful experience at 3-2-1 Acting Studios. When my son decided that he wanted to become an actor we were not sure where to start. Luckily, I have found 3-2-1 Acting Studios on Yelp  and my son was accepted to the showcase career program. Ms. Mae and her wonderful staff have supported and guided us trough every step of the process. After the showcase my son was contacted by four agencies. It has only been a couple of says so we might get even more meetings. The bottom line is that my son got a wonderful coaching experience while having lots of fun. I would gladly recommend this acting studio to anyone who wants to start their acting career.

Ms. Mae and Aiden make sure that every question is answered and every concern is resolved to your satisfaction. Trust me. I am not an easy client to please lol.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Awesome, attentive, friendly, focused and just "cool" are just some of the words to describe Ms. Mae and the instructors at 321 Acting Studios.  Studying acting is the one passion my daughter has complete focus.  But, to find the right instructor(s) is a challenge.

We heard about Ms. Mae and 321 Acting Studios from a casting crew.  This says a lot already.  We gave it a try. My daughter immediately loved the instructors and the atmosphere in which she learned.  She obtained an agent at Ms. Mae's showcase and recently booked an episode on a CBS drama.  We are so excited at the opportunities Ms. Mae and 321 Acting Studios has given our daughter.

By the way, Ms. Mae makes it a point to meet every parent and knows each child.  She (all the instructors) has true passion for her "kids".

Thanks Ms. Mae and 321 Acting Studios

I am so happy we were referred to 3-2-1 Talent Showcase Acting Studios!!!  My son's dream to become an actor is happening.  Ms. Mae has not only been instrumental in building my son's confidence but the teaching and staff are amazing.  After being chosen to be in his 1st showcase this past Saturday, we have already been contacted by 2 different agents within the week. Amazing!!!  Ms. Mae comes through on her promises. She is highly professional and knows all the ins and outs of the industry and I trust her whole heartedly.  This is the place to come for acting classes and I RECOMMEND them 100%!!!<//Review>

Reading about 321 Acting Studios from Texas left us amazed by the variety of classes offered and the opportunity to attend showcases with top Agencies. After moving here and visiting the studio we knew for sure we wanted our daughter to be a part of the 321 Acting Studios family.  The teachers are experienced and the staff is always polite.

Ms. Mae walked us through her process and guided us every step of the way.  Under her direction my daughter took all the steps needed and was ready for the showcase.  Soon after the showcase my daughter was signed to a contract with a top Agency. Ms. Mae helps every student that walks through her doors ready to take the next step.  She is humble, honest, firm and very patient with the students and parents.

We’re very fortunate to have found Ms Mae’s Acting Studio. We couldn’t ask for a better person to help guide our daughter’s career.  With her ongoing support we know were in good hands.</Text>

We enrolled our twins (4.5 yrs old) with the intent to help them gain confidence, speaking skills and overall discipline. We have received that and far more!

Ms. Mae and her staff held our hands in walking us through the entire process. Watching our twin’s blossom in this program was truly a gift. They have already received several agent request after only 1 day.

One day my 7 year old daughter expressed an extreme interest in being on television (preferably the Disney channel) so I went online and did a little research.  I found 321 Acting studious, we initially tried it out only because one of their teachers is a regular on…”The Disney Channel” (Britney Ross) and the first class is free.  After our first class…. We were hooked! Ms. Mae (the owner) and her ENTIRE staff were absolutely delightful. Everyone was so positive, friendly and so welcoming every time we were there.  After attending various classes my daughter was chosen to participate in Ms. Mae’s acting career showcase program.  In her program my daughter learned and was given, on- Camera Techniques, cold readings, Improvisations, Scene study, an audition commercial, monologue, actor reel, professional pictures with a known photographer.  Ms. Mae also held my hand and walked me through the process of being a momenger. After her program my daughter is currently represented across the board by Clear Talent Group.  Ms. Mae’s program at 321 is phenomenal and is the best money that I ever spent. We love Ms. Mae and her Staff.  I would unquestionably recommend her without any reservation.< /Review>

I've been going to 3-2-1 since July 2012. I first started by going to a free class after meeting the admissions department at the farmers market in Montrose. With my first class I fell in love with the staff and students. Everyone there is so friendly and we have a lot of fun while learning so much. I especially like the playback at the end of class because I get to see how I am doing which also helps me improve. I wholeheartedly recommend 3-2-1. You wont be sorry!!!<//text>

321 Acting Studios honestly deserves 6 stars. The teachers and staff in general are incredible. Despite the many students at 321, they still get to know each kid individually. I have learned so much here, met amazing people, and received some great headshots! 321 has also given me the opportunity to not only meet with many agencies but sign with a top one. It's the perfect place for those who want to pursue their dream of acting but don't know where to start. Read less< /Text>

I’m so happy I found this place. I was looking for a legit business and got the referral from another student’s mom. Everybody is sooooooo nice and professional, always answering your questions even after or before hours, very helpful with reminders about your appointments, giving advise. They just know what they are doing, learned so much when we signed up for the Showcase- what to wear, what to say, how to say it, opening a trust account, the photoshoot was amazing.... Everything! Thank you mrs Mae, Aiden, Ron, Alejandra....< /text>

<time>1359865413020< /time><rate>5< /rate><Text>I brought my twin daughters to 3-2-1- just to try it out and see how they'd like it.  They're in preschool, but they've never taken any kind of acting class, so I wasn't sure how it would go.  They loved it!  They tried all the warm-ups and games, participated start to finish.  The instructor Natasha was very friendly and energetic.  She and the TAs made memorizing lines and speaking easy so my girls weren't intimidated at all (which I'd worried about).  The tone of the class is all fun and play, so my girls didn't have any idea they were actually doing some pretty serious work.  And they were clearly very proud to see themselves on TV during playback and show me what they'd done in class.  Last night at bedtime I heard them whispering back and forth doing one of the warm-up word games with each other after lights-out.  They clearly had a terrific time and learned a lot of new skills they'll be using all over the place.  We're definitely coming back to 3-2-1-, and I can't wait to see them blossom and grow there.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
I'm so happy that my boys had the opportunity to work with Ms. Mae and attend 3-2-1 Acting Sudtio.  Right from the start we knew we were in the right place when Ms. Mae walked us through the entire experience.  She thoroughly explained the process in which one has to go through in enrolling their children into acting.  She was always very patient, even though she was extremely busy with many students.  She answered all my questions and addressed my concerns.  Right after the showcase, we were contacted by two agencies.  We are so excited!!!<//Review>

<time>1353283203799< /time><rate>5</rate><text>Ever since my little girl took her first steps she has wanted to perform.  “Put on a show!"
She would convince all of her friends to participate, and direct them in dancing, singing, or any other performance she could think up.

She made me promise I would help her become an actor.  So one day she came to me with a “private invitation” from someone we had never had contact with before.  They told her how special she was, and how they were inviting a small, exclusive group of talented actors to audition.  So I took her to this small, exclusive group of hundreds of children, to audition for some folks claiming connections with the Disney Company.

What I discovered was my beautiful daughter was painfully shy, unable to look another person in the eye while talking, actually incapable of answering questions asked of her.  She looked good on camera, but even with 45 minutes prep time she was unable to perform a 30 second spot with a teleprompter.

Despite what I saw as an obvious rejection, within an hour a representative called and told me that from the hundreds of talented actors, my girl was one of a handful whom they wished to be associated with.  For a mere fifteen thousand dollars, round trip airfare to Orlando FL, and two weeks hotel stay she could participate in the largest cattle call audition on the planet.  We graciously declined their offer of instantaneous fame.

Now I've learned, and accepted a long time ago, that in certain instances children exhibit more respect, listen, and learn quicker from a stranger than from their parents.  That’s why we seek out the finest teachers available.  I began looking for a reputable acting coach with contacts, and who understood how the entertainment business worked.  My search led me to Ms. Mae of 3-2-1 Acting Studios.

I can’t compliment 3-2-1 enough.  The best example of the awesome effectiveness of Ms Mae, John Walcutt, and 3-2-1 is this; 3-2-1 setup an audition for my daughter with Protégé Talent Management, who immediately signed her.  When they called me in and described what they liked, and why they wanted to represent her, it seemed as if they were talking about an entirely different person.

They loved her performance, (I’ve always loved her acting), but what surprised me was when they said how impressed at how poised she was, looking them in the eyes when she spoke, her open friendly personality, the ease at which she was able to talk with them, the intelligent questions she asked…  In essence Mae and John had transformed a shy, aloof little girl into a professional actor.

3-2-1- has a wide variety of classes all designed to help your actor achieve their goal in the highly competitive entertainment industry.  What I particularly loved was how dedicated they are in teaching you how the business works.  Weather you're in front of the camera, or at an audition they teach you what you need, enabling you to act like a seasoned professional.  Remember… learning how to act is only one part of the process.  Learning how to get the job, well that information is just as valuable, if not more.

If you are serious about helping your child, or yourself, get that first step into the entertainment business, then 3-2-1- should be on your short list of contenders. They actually do what others can only promise, but are unable to deliver.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

My son got acting lessons at 3-2-1 as a birthday present 6 months ago. At the time I was skeptical about it, but the place is close enough so I thought I could give it a try. When we went in for his first class I talked a lot to all the waiting parents and they were all very happy with the services provided. I liked that, but I was still not convinced that my son would gain anything from those lessons. But then he came out with a big smile on his face and said that he loved it and can not wait to go back. Flash forward 6 months, he's still taking lessons at 3-2-1 with interest and enthusiasm. He enjoys both TV1's instructors (especially fun and energetic Natasha) and Improvisation (learned a lot from Will,  just started with B.J). As for me, Miss Mae completely won me over. She expertly and patiently answered all my questions ( I had a lot :)), graciously guided us through our acting adventure, and made time for us when we needed it - in short, she is an expert in her field that also actively demonstrates that she cares ! I can only add that her support staff is amazing - Jodi a real computer wizzard and Alehandra always there for you.< /review>

There are so many good things to say that I don't even know where to begin. Okay, let's start here. I am more confident in my ability to speak publicly and think on my feet. I recently gave a public speech and instead of reading my speech word for word, fearing I would say something stupid or incorrect, I was able to smoothly communicate my ideas from an outline and bring out my own personality while I talked. Wow, I signed up for acting classes to learn how to act, but after taking the improv class and other classes, I'm a confident and fun public speaker. So much of what I have learned in class has translated to all of the categories in my life. The confidence you gain here will improve your life.

As an actress, I've learned how to bring out my personality and audition, what is expected of me from the casting directors, and how to get my career started. Ms. Mae is, as you've read here, absolutely fabulous. She has helped me step by step and is still here for me as I meet with different agencies and audition. As a young adult at the studio, I recommend this studio as a solid place to learn and get your career started. I know I am at least a year or two ahead of where I could be in my acting career because I started at this studio. You really get the jumpstart and training that you need.</Review>

We absolutely love Ms. Mae and her amazing acting studios, but first, the reasons we feel that way about 3-2-1 so much:
My daughter, who is now 9, has exhibited the desire to act for most of her life -- in fact ever since she wanted to run up on stage during a community theatre performance when she was 2 years-old!  When she turned 4, I realized I had to do something with her urge to perform/ham it up/what-have-you.  My wife and I decided it wouldn't be a bad idea to have her take acting lessons, if indeed any classes existed for a child that young.
We were living in La Crescenta at the time, and thus 'discovered' 3-2-1 accidentally because it wasn't far from where we lived -- and they taught kids as young as my daughter was!  As a matter of fact, I believe our girl was one of the first 4 year-olds that Ms. Mae's studio taught, and now it seems like there are quite a few comparably young youngsters happily skipping around the studios, being sheparded by 3-2-1's kind, professional and talented teachers.
Well, my little one had the time of her young life and amazingly learned so much about memorizing lines and performing them in front of the camera -- even though she could hardly read at first!
The bug for acting and being in front of the camera has only increased in the time since.  Fast forward a few years (after having not pursued a professional career for our daughter back then -- although we should have!), and we brought her back to 3-2-1 Acting Studios because as a family we all decided that our pride and joy should pursue her passion professionally. That's not to mention that we now live in Agoura Hills -- 40 miles away from La Crescenta -- but after having a strange time checking out a much larger 'modeling and acting school,' we knew we had to return to Ms. Mae!
Cutting to the chase, after this past summer's Showcase class, she showcased and got an agent (the one from four years previous also wanted her again!)! Since then, she's booked a few great gigs, including an integral part in an arthouse feature film and background for Modern Family! Through the casting sites, I've gotten her around 20 auditions so far (in three months), and we're happily optimistic about her career prognosis!
Bottom line, Ms. Mae and her wonderful acting studio is where my daughter gained the confidence to be her most genuine, delightful, performing self! From all of us, THANK YOU MS. MAE!!!< /Text>

Had my enclosed trailer stolen from there. Nobody saw nothing on a Saturday. The thief thief even directed traffic  during the heist. Total inside job by the workers. Do not use these guys. The detectives have been watching this place for a while now. From APD told me. I'm sure their gonna get theirs.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>At first I thought the place was ok,was referred by a friend . Two months into my rental was asked to relocate. There was no explanation for this. I feel the office workers are racist. Often I would see people sleeping in their truck, and carefree of the seven o'clock hr. cerfew. The people would be still on the property after-hours, that I can't understand. The staff workers that clean up didn't speak English,plus was rather rude blarring his Spanish music as loud as possible. , even I after asked could he please turn it down. Bottom line is that I am being evicted for no clear reason, this is ok because I no longer want to be at that place, I'll take my money somewhere else . I'd love to actually count how many people are Caucasian that rent there, I'm certain not many at all. This is too bad, not good business.

This is our first time renting storage for a travel trailer.  We called a number of RV storage facilities, but this was by far the best customer experience.  So we decided to check it out.  Saira was outstanding.  Great customer service and explained everything to us.< /review>

Terrible experience, the staff is rude, when you ask questions they treat you like an inconvenience.  Even worse when you ask about their procedures, basically if you don't conform they treat people like dirt.  I would never recommend this place to anyone</Review>

Ahmed is a true asset to this pizza hut location. He went above and beyond to make sure our experience was great! Besides the big rainy storm and busy store we were treated exceptionally! Pizza was hot and fresh and service was 5 star! We will be back! Thanks<//text>

#👆 They gave us a hand tossed pizza and we paid $2 extra to have a pan style crust pizza.
#✌ they forgot to put the buttery garlic on the crust. When I called back and let the manager know he said that he was going to send a guy to my house with a stick of butter.
#✌👍 I brought the food back and he only wanted to give me half credit. And no refund back on my card & it was $43.00 btw total. And no refund!!
🔥💥 So Crazy so i called the corporate office. They said they will get my money back on my card and the next day or two. We'll see if they do what they say. Until then stay away from the Pizza Hut on 1300 East Bidwell.<//Review>

< Review>
Commercials online were offering a large meat lovers for $10. Website even displayed the same thing. When I placed the order online, they called me back to tell me they wouldn't honor the order unless I paid an additional $2. Apparently, they are a "franchise" and the website/commercials are wrong.

Awesome customer service over $2 and a mistake that sounds like it's your problem, not mine.</Review>

<Review>If you are expecting a gourmet pie, go somewhere else, but if you are expecting great pizza at a great price come to Pizza Hut. I too am happy that they have finally arrived in Folsom. For much of my childhood, I ate at Pizza Hut with my family whenever there was a big game and pizza. I think if you go in expecting to have something unimaginably great, you'd be disappointed, but for a nationwide brand, Pizza Hut delivers. The staff at this Pizza Hut have been courteous and professional. If it was a toss up between Domino's, Round Table, or Mouontain Mike's I would choose Pizza Hut because I really like the way it tastes.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809ae41509c1230f:0xe078e9ea59db1414<//Gmap_id></record>

I am so glad that we finally have a Pizza Hut in Folsom because I was having stuffed crust withdrawals. Amazing pizza at a great price, what is better than that?<//Text>< Pictures>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>These guys are unbelievable! I called to place an order. I've ordered from them before so they should have my payment info on file. At any rate, they never asked for my credit card info. When the driver arrived, he told me they only take cash. This was never communicated to me by either of the people I spoke with while placing the order, neither of whom requested that I give them my credit card info. The delivery guy called the store and the manager told him that it was too late to take my credit card info and that he needed to leave and take the pizza with him! Terrible, terrible, terrible!<//Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< gmap_id>

News alert... if you want to stay in business, you will need to deliver farther then most of us in Folsom walk. 5-mile radius is the average. If they continue this rediculous delivery range, I give this place one year. FYI- if they can't drive a few miles to deliver a pizza then we will never drive there to get one.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x809ae41509c1230f:0xe078e9ea59db1414</GmapID></record>

<review>Honestly I don’t understand how they can screw up a chain restaurant’s system but they make the worst Pizza Hut pizzas.  I have tried them on two separate occasions and they were both unacceptable (doughy sloppy messes.

< review>
I would like to start off by saying that this is the best car wash in Vallejo..there's no competition hands down they are the best and you get what you pay for. They're very efficient they communicate well with one another if you have any discrepancy you can speak with the person that was servicing your vehicle and they will take care of it.. and there's always two to three people working on your vehicle one does tires while one is vacuuming one does windows as well as the interior and if you just so happen to pay one of the individual a tip they always split it with every one that was working on that particular vehicle. I will continue to go to them so long as they are in business and by the looks of it that's forever< /review>

<text>They should definitely have 5 stars.  My go-to car detailing place.  Excellent service & affordable!!!  This place does a great job detailing my car every time.  I have been to more expensive places that did not clean my car well.  I drive from Oakland to Vallejo because they treat my car that good.< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
We went and had my wife car detailed for the first time worst experience ever. Wouldn't refer this business to anybody. The car is still dirty hair and dirty all over the seats inside. Had the mattes shampooed one mat is shredded on the corner and the other one is melted  burnt remember first detailing 10000 miles on vehicle.  Went back guy at both denied us being there till I pulled out receipt. Then he went and got another guy that said the machine wouldn't do that to the Matt's and they came that way. If I could post pictures I would,  horrible. These kind of business dont need to be open not doing what they say they can do.... And when something gets messed up they deny that it was them. Brand new car floormats ruined!!< /Review>

<Text>Terrible customer service and bad clean job. They would allow me to run through the wash again to actually CLEAN my vehicle which is what I paid for. Every car wash I’ve ever been to has allowed me to do that if the first wash didn’t clean my vehicle completely. Bad management<//Text>< pictures>

Hands down the best car wash in Vallejo! I only come here to get my car washed. The prices are reasonable the staff is friendly and everything comes out of maculate. If you want your car done quickly and without hiccup definitely stop here.< /review>

Stopped taking my car here. My mirrors do not fold manually I mentioned this as I am going into the bay for the wash. They force fold my mirrors anyway and broke it. They rigged it back together and told me everything was fine. This wasn't the first time I figured I'd give me them a few chances. They are not very detailed in the work. Wheels were still dirty. When they get busy it's like chicken with their heads cut off they dont know top from bottom. Management here really needs to be held accountable or replaced. Probably lacks proper customer service training. The problem with most businesses they just want to give mediocre service to get a buck!!</Review>

When they're finished with my car, I shouldn't have to point out all the spots they missed. Frustrating. In addition, I didn't see it until I drove off and the sun was beaming through my front windshield but my windows had streaks all over them, on the inside. Dirty cloths? I don't know. I do know I'll never waste my money there again.</Review>< pics>

If you go do not let them move your car. I watched an employee move my car with the door open and drive it into a poll . It left a few scratches on my car. When i confronted the manager that was not present at the time I was told they were already there and they did not do it. And was asked to leave. I have been going here once a month for 3 years and this is the appreciation they give their customers.  DON'T GO!!!!!!!</text>

I took my car to get cleaned and one of my hubcaps broke while going through the car wash. They offered to pay to replace it with no issues. The prices are fair and they offer great customer service. I would definitely recommend this place!</Review>

Gets worse each time I go.. up til the last time. Whatever the problem hardware or product has etched my windows. I have tried heavy tipping, dual tipping... doesnt matter lackluster performance. Last time and the last time I will patronage, I think my car looked worse after they "cleaned" it. Try changing out the dirty rags you use.<//Review>

Great service at a reasonable price. Rain tunnel exterior wash and detailed interior cleaning by hand. My favorite place for a car wash. Do allow a bit of extra time for the interior cleaning and polishing.<//text>

We always take our cars to this place as it's conveniently close to our home. Line is never long, our cars are always serviced quickly. We've tried several of their options and they do an OK job regardless of what you pay for. I mean, the cars always leave cleaner than they were before but they never do an excellent job. I took my car just a few days ago and bought the basic wash for 7.99, basic exterior only. The car had bird poop right above the windshield, in a very visible spot; when I returned home I could still see the bird poop which, by the way, it's not that hard to get rid of. The back door and window were the least prepped I guess; there was no major difference between the before and after. I think they could prep better. I didn't want to go back though so I just let it go. I guess you get what you pay for, right?< /Text>

25 bucks and they washed the car cleaned the inside and out and had us out in less than 30 minutes! We were on vacation and the kids, plus driving our car through Fern Canyon had it looking bad inside and out when they were done it looked like we just picked it up from a car lot. Definitely the best place in town to get a wash!<//review>

Love this wash! You can get your car washed inside and out, plus the inside vacuumed and oiled with a smelly scent, all for 24 dollars! It is not only an insanely good deal, but the people that do the washing and detailing always does such a good job! They are quick too!<//Text>

Worst car wash. Terrible customer service. Should be shut down. I don’t think they’ve ever cleaned a car correctly in their life. It’s not science doesn’t require any true intellectual knowledge  that they couldn’t at least act like they try. I left unsatisfied ten minutes ago. A tall thin young guy and a bright red headed girl talked the entire time while mediocrely “cleaning” my blue Honda Accord  on the inside. The interior is still dirty everywhere to the point I’ll have to take it elsewhere to get it cleaned again. Ridiculous. It took me seconds to remove a coffee stain I had on the cup holder, but the guy told me he couldn’t remove it and the bright red head laughed at me. I thought about going back and complaining but a bad business is bad because the owner or manager don’t care or they’d be on top of things in the first place. I will never be back and I will make sure I spread the word to every person I know to take their business elsewhere. I have many friends and family who go there but not after this I assure you.< /text>

Between the pre-wash, the actual wash brushes, and the team "wipe-and-vac" afterward, my car always comes out looking great. Even if they miss a spot here and there it's still a lot better than doing it myself.</Text>

I used to like this place. However this is the second day in a row I've come and not been able to be serviced due to lack of staff. Its unprofessional and I'm going to find a different car wash to go to.< /review>

This is my favorite place to get my car cleaned. I have OCD and am very specific with how clean my car is. I have paid much more at car detailers in pleasant hill and walnut creek. But here I spend $25 and they do an AMAZING job. I've been coming to them for the last two years and I have left happy every single time.< /review>

<Text>Usually great service. They washed my car but the rinse cycle did not work. So they sent me back around. Unfortunately waiting on line AGAIN for 8 minutes the sun baked the soap onto the windows. I asked them to rewash it but they only sent me through the rinse again, this did not solve the problem, even after a third rinse.  The youngster kept arguing with me about my third trip through. The next day I called the manager, and he argued with me that the soap is water based, blah blah blah. Anyone knows that if you leave soap on your car in the sun it bakes it on. I'm disappointed in their professionalism and lack of willingness to clean my car.<//Text><gmap_id>0x8085731a34250c71:0xe7a5a7480e616ec7< /gmap_id><Time>1502738950093<//Time>< resp>

<Text>Third time going to this local car wash and I'm done! I paid $39 for shoddy work. I have a 2013 Toyota FJ Cruiser and they didn't
Armorall my running boards or my plastic trim, along with my 5th tire that's completely exposed on the rear of my vehicle. Interior cleaning was so so, my windshield was still full of bug marks. I've been to several car wash locations and no way can you be done on this vehicle with detail work in 15 minutes. Pass on this place, the original owners did an outstanding job, not so with the new ones...<//Text><UserId.>104205350679745112113</UserId.>< Rating>

<review>Worse car wash ever. I own a or cruiser, and the ladies dried it in less than 2 minutes. Usually I leave a tip, but this wasn't even a wipe down. She signaled that I can leave, looked dissapointed because lack of tip when I came home. Then...noticed a big slab of grease smeared on my fender. She is an idiot!</review></record></dataset><record>

Second time I’ve taken my car there ( thought the first time was a fluke ) ... not very happy with the results , still has dirt in the grill , bumper, quarter panel , and running board ... Think I’ll find somewhere else to take it.< /review>

Great place to take kids two to six years old. Excellent place for birthday parties , group picnic, little family outing, or just take the kids for a day of fun. No barbecuing allowed but you can bring your ice chest with sodas and water bring your own food. They also sell snacks and ice cream for a fair price. They have the occasional band playing at their Bandstand on certain nights.<//Review>

There is plenty of playground areas so it's not "packed", there are drinking fountains throughout. Bring a blanket, snacks and sit under tree while you watch your little one release all their energy and creativity here. $3 to get in is a fair price as well. Enjoy!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>We Loved this park. It is $3 a person unless you are two years and younger then you're free. There's a big play ground, a grass area, a big sandpit with a dino, a teapot that actually steams from the spout, tea cups that spin, a standstill train, fire truck and another play area with a building. Oh and swings.< /Review>< rating>

This is a great park! Very large, overall safe, mostly gated except for the entrance, perfect place for birthdays or other events. So many places for kids to explore and theres music playing. We liked the park so much we tried their summer movie night event, but it can be better with more community support.< /review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>It's a big playground. There are several areas of play—a humongous teacup, a sand pit, a fire house and train area, and more. They're spread apart, so you can see giggling kids running from one area to another across wide swaths of grass. And there are multiple gazebos where you can host parties. We were there recently for a birthday which was pleasant. Not a care in the world.< /review>< Pictures>

Fun and a Vallejo tradition. I went when I was a kid and my kids love it now. Spinning teacups, teapot that shoots "steam," firetruck to climb all over, playground structures, swings, sandbox...so much fun. It is also completely enclosed with just one entrance/exit. $2/person< /Text>

We live right down the street from children's wonderland, love it... It is a great place to take our little girl... Safe, clean and super helpful and friendly staff... Several different areas for kids to play in and tons of grassy area for them to run around in... Even a big sand box area for them to play in... They even have a small selection of refreshments and snacks if needed... Great place for kid's parties too...<//Text>

Big place with a good variety of things for the kids to play on or interact with. The older child is a nature kid and played with the cool water stream in the dinosaur area almost the entire time. The teapot & teacups and the cool train station/train play structure area were the younger childs favorites. There is a large play structure on the other side of the park that both kids loved. Lots of shaded and non-shaded seating as well as large grassy areas to picnic. We went midday on a Sunday and it wasn't overly busy at all! They had ice creams and popsicles for a reasonable price too.<//review>< Rate>

Came here for the first time as a Kindergartner then came again 15 years later to accompany my first nephew on his field trip as a Kindergartner himself as well. It's a trip how much the park had changed. It was completely remodeled. The staff here were nice and the park was really clean. Had lots of fun here. Now that I have my own children, I want to bring them next time.<//Review>

Always a lot of fun, you may want to bring a change of clothes for the child since there's a sand pit w water that can get messy. Price went up to $3 person from 2. Still worth it to play in a huge area that's gated and clean<//review>

My favorite aspect is that there is only one entrance/exit. Therefore, you are able to increase the watching distance of children significantly. There are wide open spaces for picnic, an oversized checkers board and even a "fossil" sand box. There are also about 3 pokestops inside for those playing Pokemon Go< /review><GmapID>0x80857312cc09f4bd:0x59e1b181554959c1<//GmapID>< Resp>

<review>8/4/19. UPDATE: GVRD staff contacted my family, informed us that they have banned the groups that were there on this day. They were very understanding of our concerns. I am changing my review to 5 stars and would give more if I could!

I took my 2 1/2 year old grandson and my friends 7 1/2 year old son there today(Friday 7/19/19) there were lots of older kids there, preteen to earlyteen that were rough housing, punching each other, calling each other names, cussing, climbing on top of the train and other structures, pushing the little kids out of the way. There were some teens with them that had badges on that I assume were in charge of teens there same age and they were just as bad as the other kids. There were no adults that were in charge to be found. I asked the teens at the entrance if they could tell me why all of these older kids were here and the said that there was a preschool field trip and 3 youth gvrd camps there today. I asked if they could get me a adult that was present with these older kids and they could not point one out.

Childrens Wonderland is a place for younger children not groups of teens having day camp. My grandson was upset and even my friends son had no fun and wanted to leave. I am so very disappointed in my time spent there, which was less than a hour and I paid $12.00 for 4 of us to enter.

I do plan on speaking to someone in the GVRD office Monday morning.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

It's nice. But it's not much different than a regular park in a nice neighborhood. Odd to be charged $2/person to get in. And they're raising the price this summer<//Review>

Great clean park to take the kids.  Everyone over 2 is two dollars.  Here's a tip, there is a water fountain near the dinosaur themed sand play area that you can use to help make sand castles.  My kids spent an hour in the sand pit alone!<//review>

Dr. Omidi, I can’t thank you 🙏 enough. You are an amazing surgeon and made my dream come true. My face lift turned out better than I expected. I look and feel so much better.  All my life I’ve had bad skin on my face so this is a big help for the years to come. You’re the best!!<//Text>

Dr. Omidi. Kudos! Dr. Omidi made precise incisions around my nipples and i hardly have any scarring still to this day! The implants were not over inflated so, I will not need a lift. There is a small amount of loose skin, but during the explantation process they will easily be able to tuck it in. The breast implant lasted about 16 years, with an unfortunate ending as the implant did rupture. Somehow, even as a saline implant it has made me extremely sick and my insurance company is fighting whether it is a medical necessity unfortunately. Danielle and associates have been nice enough to support by still making efforts for old paperwork. I have confidence they can find them to support medical need. I’m really happy that I chose Dr.Omidi to do my surgery. I wish I still lived within driving distance it would be no question where to go to have surgery again. Thanks Dr.Omidi! Oh by the way.. he’s also very handsome 😉 Truly the best surgeon Dr. 90210< /Review>

Dr Omidi went above and beyond my expectations. I’m 4 days post op and I’m so thrilled with my results already. I had consultations with 4 other top Beverly Hills surgeons and no one made me feel as comfortable and as ease as Dr. omidi did. He is truly talented. I am so glad I chose him.< /Text>

<Review>I came for a consultation to see Doctor Omidi for a rhinoplasty and from the moment I came in his staff was so welcoming, they showed me his work and boosted about how humble of a doctor he is. When the doctor came for my consultation he was very attentive, and indeed so humble! He showed me a morphed image of how he can make my nose look and I loved it! He made my nose look even better than the morph and so natural to my face! He made my eyes and lips stand out even more, and I’m truly so thankful he helped fix my breathing problems and did my nose to suit my face. The day of surgery his staff and nurses all comforted me and made the surgery day less of a panic! I want to thank Doctor Omidi, Betty, Wary and his
Whole staff for being so kind and giving me a wonderful experience. I definitely recommend Doctor Omidi!<//Review>< pics>

Went in for filler to be placed on my under eye, nose, cheekbones and lip. I was a bit nervous being that it was my first time having filler all over by face, but when speaking to the Dr. I knew I was in good hands. I was very specific about how much I wanted everywhere and he did just that. Nearly no swelling occurred and my face looks great! Definitely recommending to my friends</Review>

I went to Dr. Omidi's Beverly Hills office for Botox and fillers. It was my first time getting fillers so needless to say, I was nervous. My injector Doris was AMAZING. She patiently answered all my questions and listened to the desired result I wanted. Waree and Betty at the front desk were probably the best staff I've ever encountered at any doctor's office. Thank you all for making my experience so wonderful!< /Text>

I had the most amazing experience with Michael Omidi and his staff. Most importantly, he was able to achieve the most beautiful, natural looking results. He and his staff really listened my my specific needs and desired result, and took the time to answer all my questions. This clinic gets 5 stars for being so knowledgeable, patient, helpful, and making me feel completely comfortable and welcomed. The whole team is really amazing. Michael Omidi is down to earth and easy to communicate with, while also being a master of his craft. I already recommended Michael and his office to all of my friends! Not only do they make you feel so comfortable and welcome, I also trust their competency 100%.. Whoever visits him will not be disappointed.< /review>

One of the physicians assistants did tear trough filler on me at Michaels office and completely messed my face up. I asked many times to have a very small amount done, I did not want the entire ML put into my face and wanted to look natural. I called later to find they indeed put the entire ML in. I looked horrible and had to be put on augmentin after the service. It’s been 17 days since the service was done so swelling is not the issue. I was completely overfilled and now have to go to Skin By Lovely in Santa Monica to have it dissolved because I don’t trust anyone at this office to do anything else to me after seeing how disfigured this left my face. If you google “botched tear trough filler” I look like the 3rd photo in. Michael offered to dissolve it free of cost but as I said above I’ve lost complete trust in this office and never want to return. It’s disappointing to me that after such a horribly done job I was not refunded at all. This was fully the offices fault, the woman who injected me should not be injecting people. She didn’t listen to anything I said and obviously isn’t experienced enough and doesn’t have the right eye to be doing these services.<//text>

< Review>
I'm literally in love with my nose!!! Ever since I could remember I was always self conscious with the appearance of my dorsal hump. This brought a toll to me because it was a feature that brought my confidence down. I would always try multiple ways of hiding it until I finally decided to see what could be done. Dr.Omidi was my #1 rhinoplasty surgeon who took his time to describe and help me understand the process of getting the nose I desired. I cannot explain the joy that came to me once I saw that dorsal hump removed and finally see the finish result. Dr.Omidi did an amazing job and thanks to him I can finally say that my confidence has boosted up tremendously! His work is beyond incredible and I would totally recommend his work. If I could give more than 5 stars I would 100% do!!!< /Review>

I really enjoy going to Dr. Omidi’s office. Everyone is so nice, professional, and knowledgeable. I have been  there several times for Botox, Juvederm, and a consultation for my daughter’s rhinoplasty. They have good deals on services and the consultation for her surgery was thorough, as he provided morphed photos to help her with her decision. One other great thing is that Dr. Omidi is such an expert. He explained things to me regarding the best place on my face for fillers. He actually showed me all the places our faces age first and best locations for Botox, too. I will return to this office and am a happy patient. Thanks, Dr. O!< /text>

I had a wonderful experience. I normally get Juvederm, and I went here to try Restalyne injections for my lips. What a difference! My lips look amazing! The check in process was a little tedious, but that's only because I'm a new patient, and I had to fill out my profile. So if you're a new patient, get there about 20 minutes before your appointment. I had two different people come to me to explain different procedures that their doctor does, which I didn't really like, but I get why they're doing it. I wish I would've had more time to discuss some other procedures that I'm really interested in with the doctor, but I'll just make another appointment. I LOVED that they helped me with pricing! I brought a groupon, and they matched the discount on groupon, which is KILLER!!! This was a gift to myself, and they really made me feel good about my purchase! I WILL be coming back, and I will be bringing referrals!</Text>

<text>Dr. Omidi is the absolute best! I have come to him for several procedures over the past 10 years, and he has never failed to surpass my expectations each and every time!  He has an excellent eye for asethetics and his work is phenomenal.  I am very, very happy with my results!

I'm a person who typically worries about anything and everything.  So I always appreciate how he answers my questions in great detail and seeks to ensure that I understand him completely.  He puts all my fears to rest.  He is extremely kind and caring, readily available, and I always leave his office feeling very comfortable and more confident.

If you're looking for a top quality surgeon, who is double Board Certified, with great bedside manners, who truly seeks after your best interest... I urge you to look no further! Dr. Michael Omidi is, hands down, the best there is!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Dr. Omidi is absolutely amazing! I chose to have a breast lift and tummy tuck after major weight loss and couldn’t be happier with my new body. He was able to answer all my questions and concerns before and after my procedures and made me feel comfortable every step of the way.

<Time>1575563026067<//Time><rate>5</rate><review>I meet Dr Omidi on March 2019 for first time. He is a very kind, knowledgeable and caring plastic surgeon. Not only that but his staff are caring and friendly.
He did my daughter’s Rhinoplasty surgery on April 2019. Her nose has totally changed, it is so beautiful and natural now. Dr. Omidi and his staff are always available to answer patient’s question at any time.
Last week, I did my Septoplasty and Rhinoplasty. The day after surgery I had a question, and I sent a text message to Dr. and he answered back to me saying he would open his office to check me when his office was closed due to thanksgiving holidays. I am really appreciative of what he did for me and my daughter. I can not wait to share my new nose’s picture.
Thank you Dr. Omidi. You are the best.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Dr. Omidi is a caring and passionate surgeon. He is honest and upfront about everything. In addition, he is not like some other plastic surgeons who just want to perform hundreds of procedures on you and turn you into a fake looking person. His creativity turns you into a more beautiful you. I highly recommend dr. Omidi.</Review>

After much research, I decided to schedule a consultation with Dr. Omidi for a tummy tuck. It was my first and last consultation. I felt very comfortable with and assured that he was the doctor I wanted to go with and I have not regretted my decision one bit. Dr. Omidi is very kind and has a wonderful staff. I ended up getting the tummy tuck procedure with a fat transfer to the butt in April 2017 and I love my results! Although trying at times, which is to be expected, the process has been better than I anticipated.</text>

I met Dr Omidi back in 2015 for a consultation. After consulting many MANY plastic surgeons within CA, AZ, CO over the past 10 years I finally connected with a Plastic Surgeon that I felt confident and comfortable with performing my tummy tuck. I am a nervous patient by nature and he took his time explaining and answering all my questions prior and leading up to my tummy tuck and gave me the care and patience after my tummy tuck. I immediately scheduled my appointment and booked my procedure.

I am 3 years post op. and my results are amazing! I’ve never felt more confident in my own skin than I do now. I now visit his office frequently for fillers and botox. I’ve had so many different doctors for these small procedures and never again will I go anywhere else for my botox and fillers.

What I love most about each of my experiences with Dr. Omidi is his passion, he is a visionary and is so passionate about giving his clients the results and goals they want to obtain. I can’t express how much Dr. Omidi goes over and beyond for each of his patients.
Not only is Dr. Omidi the best in his industry I have never felt more welcomed and cared for.

Dr. Omidi was referred to me by friends that had a rhinoplasty.  I was worried about having a natural nose job.  The recovery was exactly how he described.  Very happy with how it looks now.  I can breathe better.  Definitely the doctor I will refer to my friends and family.< /Review>

< review>
After couple of consultation with other plastic surgeons when I met Dr. Omidi for the first time
I knew that I reached my destination.
He is not only an incredible surgeon, he is an awesome human being he gave me the confidence to go forward with the procedure I wanted.
He managed to cover everything within  less than a week concerning preop, he has an awesome team and I felt like I know him for years...I knew that I was in excellent hands.
I would recommend him to all my family and friends for any cosmetic and  reconstructive procedures they want to be done . I wish him the best .He deserves the title of the best surgeon< /review>

My experience with Dr Omidi
Was like no other surgeon I have met before.

He is a true perfectionist, with a gifted vision an artist every step of the way.
From the initial phone call to scheduling the first consultation. Dr Omidi gave me time to voice my own concerns then he explain everything he saw.

I knew I was in the hands of someone who wanted the best for me. He never pressed me to move forward with the procedure. It wasn’t about just getting another patient .

I spent 4 years researching plastic and reconstructive surgeons. After being unhappy with two previous augmentation with unsatisfactory results,
more conveniently-located surgeons, experiencing cost, countless hours in multiple surgeries, recoveries... Finally my search stoped the moment I came across Dr Omidi
I deeply value his honesty

In Post Op his bedside manner was unparalleled. He checked on me frequently to make sure I was okay.

I have not felt this good about my body in years!
I can not begin to express how grateful I am for him and his incredible team. From anesthesiologist, to Daniela, Annika, Gerald, Chantal to name a few for being part of my life changing moment.

I have no doubt I’ve made an excellent decision.

If you are thinking of getting plastic surgery, schedule a consultation and see for yourself.
***** Highly recommended*****</review>

After having four consultations and still unsure if I wanted to go through with my surgery, I gave it one more chance and came in to see Dr. Omidi. I can't even begin to explain how comfortable he made me feel, explaining all steps and answering all my questions. He took all my concerns and worries away after my consultation. I scheduled my surgery two weeks after, and was so excited. Everything I asked the doctor to do, he did. My results are amazing and I couldn't be more happy! I'm so happy I picked Dr. Omidi, I have no regrets and love my new nose/look. Thanks doc!!!< /review>

I met with several doctors, but was turned off for one reason or another, until I scheduled a consult w Dr. Omidi. The staff was very welcoming and made me feel comfortable from the moment I called to book an appointment all the way through post-surgery. Dr. Omidi is a skilled surgeon and a true artist, and really cares about his patients.
I absolutely recommend him and his staff! Thank you for giving me back my confidence, and making me feel like myself once again!< /review>< GmapID>

Dr Michael Omidi has been my “go to” Dr for many years. His work is art and his staff is like family to me. They all take such good care of me and never make me feel uncomfortable. Dr Omidi cares about his patients and staff and that’s shows a lot about his character. I couldn’t ask for a better surgeon.<//review>

I decided to get a procedure done with Dr. Omidi because a close friend had recommended me him, i'm very glad I was able to decide on Dr.Omidi to do procedure on me for an ear otoplasty, I was very worried and scared since it was my first procedure ever, but Dr. Omidi and his team and were able to answer all my questions and concerns about the procedure and what I should expect, I am more than satisfied with the results and I would definitely recommend Dr. Omidi for any type of procedure in the near future, it's only been a few weeks since my surgery and I've been loving the results more and more as each day goes by! Thank you Dr. Omidi and his team!< /Text>

I heard of him from several friends that had rhinoplasty with him.   My results are excellent. I couldnt get my six packs woth all the exercise in the world.  Now it comes out with a little workout.  My nose is refined and natural without looking done.< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1533506385450, 'text': 'Thank you for your review. We’re happy with your experience.

So i had my first appointment Yesterday and  his staff made me feel so comfortable to be there. ..

BUT!! why is it that i have to wait foooorrr eeevvveerrr!! and the lady that helped me was going crazy with everything going on. Once i got there all i hear is other patients complaining in the waiting area.

i don't know about you guys but when a patient in the waiting area is talking about how they paid off other patients with bad results it made me very uncomfortable.

Don't think ill be coming back here.</review>

After years and years of insecurity over the hump on the bridge of my nose, I finally did my research in hopes of finding the perfect doctor to perform a rhinoplasty. Dr. Omidi’s name came up everywhere I looked with incredible reviews, so he seemed like a good choice to look into. I set up a consultation through RealSelf and everything fell into place after that. Dr. Omidi And his staff were incredibly accommodating and I truly felt I was their number one priority. They took such great care of me and made me feel so comfortable. I am a week into my recovery post rhinoplasty and I feel great. I can’t wait to see the final results!< /text>

I highly recommend Dr Omidi! he really took his time with me consulting about a variety of laser treatments I was interested in. I did refirme(a skin tightening treamtment) and laser hair removal so far everything looks great. I plan on doing CO2 fractional laser in the near future...Can't wait!<//Text>

Dr. Omidi is the best. I broke my right hand October last year. I came in and he told me I need surgery done right away befor the bone starts healing the wrong way. I didnt know my insurance lapsed and was cancelled until that happened. He went in and did the surgery pro bono anyway and aligned the bones together so it will heal straight. I really appreciate the thought that he put my situation on top of everything else. Now, my hand is back to its original state with no deformities. He also made me feel at home and very comfortable as he saw I was anxious because it is my first surgery ever. He explained the whole procedure in very simple terms that I understood every single part of it.</Text>

It was around 10am on a Saturday morning & the drive-thru was Madness & the line was out the driveway & into the street. So I parked & went in.  Service was reasonably fast, the food was fresh & what I expected. What more can you ask.</text>

Clean McDonald's in a central location in the San Pedro area. I have only visited the drive-through here and service has always been very fast with at most 1-2 cars in front. There's plenty of parking available to eat your drive-through meal. Quality is good as always at McDonald's. Conveniently located on a main road, close to the highway.</review>

I got a Chicken McGriddle and a Chicken Biscuit sandwich from the breakfast $1/$2/$3 menu. Total cost was 2 for $3.50. I really liked the McGriddle sandwich which used moist pancakes instead of bread or biscuit. I would definitely order this again. It tasted like there was some syrup on it but I couldn't find any. I'd ask for it next time. The biscuit was good but a bit dry with no sauce or butter. The chicken in both sandwiches was battered, fried and seasoned. Well priced, tasty, and fast from order to pickup, I'd order these items again.<//Text>

It's record fast, consistently delicious, and now there are 2 drive thru lanes.  Unfortunately, everyone around here in san pedro knows that and the lines stretching out to the street might make you take a detour.</review>

I Ordered 4a Crispy Chicken Sandwich from the menu on McDonald's San Pedro Mar 11 2021 and I have to say I am very disappointed on the size of this Flat Chicken sandwich the Crispy Chicken sandwich is basically just a Cheap Regular Chicken sandwich on the McDonald's Menu don't Waste you money on this fake upgrade of a Chicken Sandwich it is flat and Ugly.< /text>

Very friendly was in town for just few hours and most places denied restroom use but thankfully McDonald's didn't turn us away. The restrooms where clean and never had issue with the food on prior visits. But due to covid places think they can allow for them to shut down there restrooms to the public just because they are lazy. So much appreciation to the staff for keeping the restrooms clean and useable I will definitely Express my gratitude to the owner thank you< /Text>

I had ordered a simple meal. Just the number 6 which is a chicken nugget meal. It was simple and very delicious. The chicken nuggets were perfectly cooked and toasted. I used a coupon for my meal where I got a free happy meal if you bought a combo and they used the coupon. I know some places make it a hassle to use the coupon but they happily took it with no questions asked.< /text>

I'm only giving McDonald's a good rating because the food is good and fast although you may get the wrong sandwich occasionally they are good about replacing it the next day if you leave them your name when you call to remind them that they made a mistake to which they will finally admit LOL ? It's just a sandwich!!</text>

The only item worth buying is their fries. Everything else is so artificial and mixed with oat. Here's a mystery question: How come McDonald's can put a whole slice of cheese on a hamburger yet put 1/3 slice of cheese on their fish fillet?<//Review>

The food quality is good but the wait is always long. No matter what time I go, I am always told to wait in the designated spot for them to bring out my food.</text>

<Review>A very greasy quarter pounder. I had ordered extra lettuce but opened it before I left and found none so by the time they put extra lettuce on, my burger was cold. This one is way too crowded and cheap in the way they throw the food at you.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Wow, I never go to McDonald's. This one was really well maintained. Are all of them like this or is this a rare gem? You can order at the computer or the counter (or drive thru). When you use the computer, you put in your order, near the end you take a number from the stack of numbers, and go to a table! My food was ready very fast. There were people helping if you needed help at the computer.<//text>

Do not buy hear often.
But this time was pretty decent. One ⭐ missing because an item missing.< /review>

<text>This is the best McDonald's I have ever visited. Love going here...I don't eat a lot of fried foods. However,  whenever I am in San Pedro, California..I always stop in and get a fish combo from them. Service is perfect and consistent.  They take pride in their work...portion size is perfect. (They don't just throw your fries in the bag so they are all over the place), they put them in correctly. Sandwich is picture perfect.  I love going here ...everyone is friendly and courteous.  Love this place keep doing it the right way you all. Place is always clean and I just can't find anything wrong with them. I haven't used the rest rooms. I'm just there to grab some lunch...they're great!!!Best McDonald's on the planet....San Pedro, California..I'll take a picture next time... 😎 man, I am getting hungry...<//text><UserId.>105755136585028231382</UserId.><gmapID>0x80dd36243c86c38b:0xb526ae6d3570ca19<//gmapID>< Name>

You can almost never go wrong when your craving fries and a vanilla milkshake, McDonald's always makes the best of both items.

Oh & their chicken nuggets are pretty bomb too, as long as you ordrr bbq& buffalo sauce also this sounds weird but I like using syrup and ketchup and its so good its crazy...

Wow I just finally realized why I had been gaining so much weight
😧😟😦...

I did not like this McDonald's because they are rude and they take a long time to serve your food. I went today an hour ago and I was asking for a ranch and they said it's in the bag  and they're being disrespectful to my husband.<//Review>

I do have to say the rest rooms were clean the lobby was clean what I disliked about this visit is that there was only myself and one other person in front of me the manager took their ordered as soon as they were done walked away and didn't at least take my order. Take about 5 minutes for her to turn around and then say Oh be right with you waiting about another 2 1/2 minutes to 3 for a young lady that walked in from taking a food bag to a parked car to ask me did you order yet I said nope still waiting then she escorted me to the computer ordered once the screens and took my order there which was much appreciated but horrible customer service from the manager</Text>

<Name>Yuchi< /Name><Date>1562778314520<//Date><rate>3</rate><review>I've been to this location quite a few times over the years when I visit San Pedro. The food has been consistent, but never fantastic. The fries are warm, not hot. The drinks are just slightly off-calibration, and the food will stall the hunger, but not satisfy the cravings. Would I recommend it? Sure, if you're hungry and just want some cheap food. Otherwise, there are better food alternatives in the area.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Bought 2 combos, a #1 large and a #4 large. Got home, was missing 1 fry. Went back and they said I didnt buy 2 fries... I bought 2 combos, got 2 sandwiches and 2 cokes... 1 fry.  They refused to look at the receipt, wouldn't give me my 2nd fry. Didnt want to argue and just payed for the fry for the second time. Got home, opened the bag and the fry was half empty. I payed twice for the same large fry and got a small. Cant wait until your jobs are automated.<//Text>

This location has the friendliest staff whether you go in to order or at the drive thru. Best thing is you can clearly hear the person working the drive thru when placing order.

<Review>If I could rate this restaurant zero stars I would. The manager is rude, incompetent and just an absolute disgrace to customer service. I will not be returning back here. I was sold old breakfast burritos and when trying to exchange them she tried to insinuate that the burritos were from days ago when in fact I had the receipt with me dated for that morning. She initially refused to give me a refund or freshly made burritos. After being yelled at and completely disrespected she finally returned my money. I don’t recommend going here.</Review>< Pics>

They keep parking customers just so their serve time is low
Edit*
I had 2 stars but now im giving it one, if i could give it zero stars i would
Okay so the only reason this mcdonalds parks your car when you go to drive thru is because inside they put that your order is finished and was given to you, its a system they follow so their serve time is low, when that happens they get good reviews from the higher ups. Now this is terrible because all employees are rushed more than usual and that tends to mess orders up and sometimes they even forget about your order< /Review>

Wouldve given this place negative stars if possible. Customer service was horrible. Tried to get a refill on my coffee and the actual manager said no because we had been there longer than 30 min. I honestly had no words and just walked out. I also asked if I could pay for a soft drink but that I didn't need a cup because I wanted to use my empty iced coffee cup since it holds up better. She also said no. Guess what they say is true. Bad comes when we try to do things the right way<//review>

We got there by 10:57pm not knowing they close at 11pm. After waiting for almost 10 mins I drove to the front window were i asked if they were close and the girls in the front didnt even said anything they just ignored us. And with hand signs they said they were close. Before all this a girl was outside, she could at least said they were close but she just kept walking and looking at us..<//text>

This McDonald’s is by far one of the most well-kept In the chain that I’ve seen. It’s very tidy and wholesome. The food is served hot and fast, and when two burgers were missing from our order, we received them within three minutes. The cashiers are very nice and copy down all of your order, and the food is somehow better than a multitude of other restaurants that I’ve been to in the chain.< /review>

I don't know why I keep coming back here, every single time I pull away from the drive through I have to check my food. Sure enough I have to make a u-turn... In some way or another some part of my order is wrong. Sometimes it's just the wrong item, other times, I just get a slice of cheese between two buns (how does that even happen), other times it's probably someone else's order!
The Gaffey location is convenient on your way in or out of town, but I think I'll take the extra time to go up to Western from now on.</Review>

They were busy, but quick with their service. Wish the McD's by me was this quick. Plus this location had all my items in the bag, mine usually screws up my order.< /Review>

<Text>That was the first mc donalds i ever been to. My nana lived on 4th st. When i was a kid this place first opened. One night they got robbed and the guys fled through nana's back yard leaving around 86 dollars in change in their departure. I used to get a hamburger,fries and a malt for around 35 cents.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dd36243c86c38b:0xb526ae6d3570ca19<//Gmap_id></record>

This is the worst McDonald’s there is !!
In the past 2 weeks Ive has a quarter pounder in Redondo on PCH & one on PCH & western in harbor city
The one on Gaffey in San Pedro was flat, burnt, dried out & just a miserable excuse for a burger..
The reason I’ve sought out quarter pounders recently is the first one in Redondo was so good- fat, juicy, little bit pink - bun was fluffy pickles & whatever sauce was generous
So I was craving..  ( frankly I don’t remember them tasting this good)
So I was in harbor city & that one was also excellent ...  In San Pedro on Gaffey was so extremely bad I remembered why I don’t eat McDonald’s or any fast food burgers
Horrible❗️ So long to you guys for another 15 years (unless I’m out of town)<//text>

<text>Drive thru ALWAYS takes forever so expect that. Went for their 2 for 5.00 mix and match. What I'd like to know is why would you ask me what kind of sauce I wamt for my 10 piece if you dont bother putting them in the bag? I was off the property almost to the freeway and realized no sauce. I had to go all the way back, park and go inside to ask for sauce they forgot. Happens often</text>< Rate>

<review>Gotta say this is one busy Micky D's. I was  going to pass this place up upon my initial impressions because how crowded it was in the morning. For real, the parking lot is double most or triple some McDonads and it was almost to full capacity. Then the drive-thru lines had about 10 vehicles in line wrapping around to the street. Well, to my surprise the line inside was super quick! I was in and out in a snap :-)

What I liked...
* Nice new looking remodel.
* Super large parking lot with easy parking.
* Preparation of food was very fast given the amount of customers in the morning rush.
* It was an extra bonus that both the employees and store patrons were unusually friendly and smiling. That's not the reputation Long Beach has, but certainly nice to see :-)

What I didn't like...
* Nothing comes to mind.

Food = as expected
Service = friendly
Seating area = very clean<//review><Response>None</Response></record>

I paid got on the road opened a sandwich sure enough no folded egg and the gross unremovable cheese. I was already getting on freeway. I gave the food to a homeless guy at exit of freeway.

<review>Waited 10 mins for food although several people that were in line behind us got their food right away. I only ordered a 2 cheeseburger meal. Didn't think it was anything difficult.. Not very fast at all. Not that busy compared to several other McDonald's I have been to... They had more than enough staff, just prob not very able-bodied.< /review>< pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Very crowded around the order counter on Saturday mornings, partly because they would rather show you how to use the self-order kiosk instead of just taking your order. And the self-serve kiosk is only good if you pay by credit card because if you are paying with cash you have to go to the cashier anyways.<//review>< pics>

<text>I go there every morning between 7a and 8am to get my son his favorite breakfast, pancakes only with an orange juice. They are always very busy and the drive thru has long lines  throughout the day. But don't let that prevent you from getting in line because they are great at their job, they are fast, courteous & show great teamwork!< /text>< Pics>

I actually really like the customer service at both San Pedro McDonalds. They have some cool, lower calorie meals for breakfast like egg whites and spinach, as well as some pretty potent coffee drinks.< /review>

McDonald's on Gaffey sucks. You can ever order,pay,grab your food and go on your way. The staff is rude. They always have cars park and wait for their food to arrive. So inconvenient.<//review>

<Text>It is a hit or miss location. Either they are on point and everything is correctly made with no issues, or they ignore the large print that says how to make a burger and forget to bag 1/4 of the meal. However, no matter what side of the coin they are that day, everybody has always been friendly and accommodating.</Text>< Pics>

McDonald's is usually like one of my favorite places in the world that I can eat just about almost everyday but just that one time it was horrible or not that one time it's been several times where they always give you fries that seem reheat it or cold and that's just about it when it comes to McDonald's their fries are is always horrible not times outta 10 you have to ask for fresh fries or defies like I said I just like they've been cooked in old grease all these restaurants need to start changing that grease more frequently.....< /Review>

Staff is nice. It’s some times not busy in the evenings. Just be careful when it gets super busy the drive thru really bogs down the speed of receiving your orders and getting in and out of there. Other than that never really had a problem with my food tastes the way Mc Donald’s food usually tastes.<//text>

These guys closed the drive thru 10 minutes early and didn’t tell anybody. I waited 15 mins with several other cars in the drive thru line, each car waiting for a while with no reply from the employees about being closed. Then driving off. The next car comes and waits, then has to drive off. Even after 11, there’s no indication that they are closed. They shouldn’t close early, people count on those last 5 or 10 minutes sometimes. And even worse, they don’t make it clear to people that they’re closed.</review>

Employee spill shake on a customer in front of her manager Judith and both just laughed at the customer ..real unprofessional. ..no sorry or even bothered to try to help customer clean her clothes...also Judith was so unconcerned with the customer and instead gave the only employee that has been the most helpful when I come here a hard time just because the customer don't want to use the kiosk... SOOOOOO SORRY RAQUEL (Employee) that you have people like her as a Manager to work with. Such wrong ETHICS FOR MANAGING JUDITH!!<//Review>

<Text>It never fails, I order thru the drive thru, which is supposed to be quick and 30 to 35 minutes later I'm still sitting in the #2parkingstall waiting for my food. Once I get it,  my order is always missing something.  They are disorganized and careless. The location us great, the personnel including the management is in dangerous ground, they just dont get it. Dont come here, it's not even worth a fry.<//Text>< UserId.>

Employee spill shake on a customer in front of her manager Judith and both just laughed at the customer ..real unprofessional. ..no sorry or even bothered to try to help customer clean her clothes...also Judith was so unconcerned with the customer and instead gave the only employee that has been the most helpful when I come here a hard time just because the customer don't want to use the kiosk... SOOOOOO SORRY RAQUEL (Employee) that you have people like her as a Manager to work with. Such wrong ETHICS FOR MANAGING JUDITH!!< /Review>

<Text>These guys closed the drive thru 10 minutes early and didn’t tell anybody. I waited 15 mins with several other cars in the drive thru line, each car waiting for a while with no reply from the employees about being closed. Then driving off. The next car comes and waits, then has to drive off. Even after 11, there’s no indication that they are closed. They shouldn’t close early, people count on those last 5 or 10 minutes sometimes. And even worse, they don’t make it clear to people that they’re closed.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

Bad customer service, wait time is ridiculous! Another bad service, I asked for a frappé without whipped cream. The lady got whipped cream on it then when she realized the mistake, instead of doing another one, she mixed everything...tasted horrible!<//Review>

Worst drive thru ever. What is the point of the drive through if they just make you go park and wait for 15 minutes. Ridiculous!!!
They make all cars wait. Ugh!</Text>

< Review>
The security guard patrolling the restaurant was very rude and disrespectful. My child was out of line and sat on the table. He then asked who's child it was, I said "mine" he then asked "do you let your child sit on the table at home?" I then said "of course not why would you ask me that" he said "well you're neglecting your child letting her sit on the table" I told him to shut the eff up. Told him he was rude and disrespectful to me as a customer and consumer he did not have to speak to me that way" he then said if you don't like it leave" I then got up to speak to m anagement and they were joking about it I asked for the info to his company and she took my name and number on a napkin and said she would give it to her superior. Then as I was speaking to the manager about it he told me to leave or he would place me under arrest. My children then started crying and got very upset. I know it's just McDonald's but I won't ever go there again.</Review>

<Text>The only Mickie D's in San Pedro proper! A popular and happenin' spot to eat inside or drive thru! Okay, well maybe "happenin'" is being a little silly... Still, this joint is busy all day long, especially at the traditional lunch and dinner times. However, this particular iteration of the franchise really tends to be well-kept, maintained and the service is above average for fast-food chains of this calibre(most of all, McDonald's, because so many of the franchise's locations survive strictly on name). I have had very good experiences with the employees here for the most part. And the crusty-looking riff-raff crawling across the town somehow doesn't assert a distracting presence here as they often do at low-cost, high-volume establishments. Their bathroom is even public access, no lock! A strong example of this chain, made more pronounced by the lack of others nearby</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Name>Devon Harlon</Name></record>

The Mushroom Swiss burger a a major disappointment. It tasted old. :(
I don't expect a lot out of McDonald's, however, you do expect a level of consistency that you can get anywhere. the french fries and the drinks were okay but like I said the burger was a big disappointment.<//Text>

< Review>
Worst meal I ever had at a McDonald's. We had to order at a screen which took forever and didn't give me a receipt. Then my mom's and my burgers were both wrong. Then they don't explain that you are supposed to grab a drink cup yourself from the rack. By the time we got our burgers back, they were cold. And to top it off, there was no toilet paper in the bathroom.< /Review>

< Review>
The biggest problem with this McDonald's is it's drive-through formation, it's not easy to get in or out of, although the customer service is exceptional in the meal quality is good as well.</Review>

Never gets my order right. There is always a long wait in the car. Still need to pull over and wait some more for one of the staff to stop by your car and give you wrong sandwiches and coffee without the sugar and not enough creamer.< /Text>

The food is great, the customer service is okay, they somehow always manage to mess up the orders. Make sure to check food before taking off.</review>
