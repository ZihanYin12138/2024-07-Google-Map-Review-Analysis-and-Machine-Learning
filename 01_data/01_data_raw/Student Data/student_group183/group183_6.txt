Great customer service but why do I have to wait just to receive my money last time when I made a mobile deposit I had to wait from December 17 all the way till Christmas just to receive my deposit I was not happy I wasn’t able to do the things that I was suppose to do like pay my rent etc I had to spend days just being curious on when my money will come ..... so I just went to wells Fargo on Friday January 17 @11:45 so I tried to make the deposit there reloading the money to my account and cash out what I need in hand and they still told me I have to wait because they was go place a hold on my account just because I recently just open it why should me opening up a bank have to do with me putting money into my account that’s weird and strange CHASE DID NOT DO THIS TO ME when I was with them so why wellsfargo ??? I’m going to just wait a while probably 2 more months to make my next deposit since I’m so new I can’t put more then $500 into my account< /Text>

<text>Service needs additional training and improvement! I had an appointment for the bank and spoke with the lobby director for assistance. The lobby director's speech was short/abrupt/rude having me move aside and told to wait another 30 mins for assistance. I saw this consistently with African American customers. However, while speaking to Hispanic customers, he was cordial and spoke kindly in Spanish. The attitude and behavior was not consistent amongst all customers. 😡<//text>< Pictures>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>This is the only Wells Fargo Bank in my area. The branch is off of Crenshaw and Imperial Highway which is a busy intersection practically 7 days a week. I do not recommend driving to this location from any other direction but south bound down Crenshaw. The traffic from any other direction is absolutely ridiculous. Parking is another issue. There is absolutely no parking on the branch property simply because there are too many cars and people. Street parking is what I would advise so you are able to get out of the packed location quick and safe. Inside the branch I waited in a full line of people for about 10 minutes. Once i made it to the teller, my deposit transaction was fast and took no longer than a few minutes. This 3 star rating is based on all the information listed above.

**Edit** 7-14-16
Went into the branch today and SURPRISINGLY, there was NO line.
I did not have my wallet, ID or ATM card. I was still able to make a deposit because I had my Account # and did not need any cash.

I am updating the review to 4 star.

Thanks<//Review>< Response>

< Review>
Is this even a real bank or just a licensed vendor because my gawd... by far the absolute worst in person banking experience I've ever had. An hour to make a deposit!? Seriously?? The staffing ratios are horrible, the tellers that were in windows were all slow as molasses, and EVERYBODY wants to chat. I'm sorry, but you being friendly is completely irrelevant if it takes you 15-20 minutes with every guest. I don't know if this is a training location for new employees or something but this is just unacceptable. I highly encourage you to never go to this "branch" if anything you need requires human interaction. Abandon all hope.</Review>

2 stars for employee "Jasmine"
Jasmine never once smiled if she greeted me I couldn't even hear her. I place the deposit bag in the window slot & then began to watch how she pulled everything out & started placing it Bk through the window instead of inside the bag. For them to have security officers / guards & metal detectors she isn't worried about me getting robbed. She allowed everyone to see what I was getting back instead of placing the items in the deposit bag as it was given to her. I asked her to please place the money inside the deposit bag as it was given to her & she rolled her eyes & did so. I said thank you Jasmine & she just looked at me. This is the 1st time ever had I had this experience with this bank. We're a business & this isn't how you keep customer's whom has bank with you for over 10 years. Maybe she hasn't had her Starbucks. Hopefully her day will get better.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Too many questions just to open an account. Not enough tellers working. I'm sitting there waiting for a teller to help me and then I see two tellers walking by laughing and joking with each other. That's why I went to Chase Bank on Century. Better service there. I was in and out within twenty minutes, and yes I did open account with Chase Bank.</review>< pics>

So i purposely acted like a jerk, to one of the clerks, saying i hit checkings, not savings, and no matter what i threw at hit he just kept cool and was as polite as he could be, I do that in some places, to see how their service is, and you can tell by how the staff greets you to how they treat you that they have consequences.</text>

I have a LOVE-HATE relationship with this store!  I usually enter the store with only ONE item in mind, but I walk out the store having easily spent $15 - $20.

I love this store,  but my pocketbook doesn't.  I am usually 99% satisfied with my purchases!  Very rarely have I been disappointed with my purchase!

And when I am disappointed, I  remind myself, "Hey, what do you expect for a dollar?," which seems to make things better.<//text>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>Pretty clean,  for a dollar store,  decent selection. But when I tried to ask if they had any more of a product, I had seen the other day, I was met with frustration. As if the idea I would ask this woman something at all were a complete waste of her time and I still didn't get any answer so I ended up leaving empty handed. Which is unusual since I'm right there with most that you go into this store to grab one thing and leave with a full cart!</Text></record>

<review>Everything is of course a dollar. I like that when I need sonething I know I wouldn't keep for long.. I go here. Like for party needs and stuff. But that's just it.. quality will suffer. Although some things like school supplies, paper crafts, are worth the buy here.< /review>< Name>

I got there at 8 am grabbed all my items and stood there for 10 mins at check stand 1 while the manager and cashier stood there talking in Spanish. Than looking up and the cashier rudely saying "Oh! I'm on check stand 2, and roughly handling my items!"</text>

The ribs, the dumplings and all the sides were delicious.  Not to mention we felt so welcome and the customer service was superb. Can't wait to come back to try the cold noodles.< /Review></record>

Good cold korean noodle place. Taste is excellent but it is pricey. I would say it's worth it to go try it but if you are looking for really cheap place, not the right place.<//Review>

In my opinion they were much better after they opened up many years ago.  They still are not bad but not good as used to be.  Their cold noodles(many myon?) Use to ne one of the best around but.... I think they had chef changed.  Its still the same owner.  Today I had sa-sacc-bibimbab which is bunches of rabbit food(like European salad) and raw fish with rice and it was pretty good.<//Text>

This place is delicious. They serve a hot drink when you get seated. It's some kind of beef soup. Yum. My favorite dish is the galbi tang. The dolsot bibimbap is also really good. The meat in the galbi tang is the perfect amount and just the way I like it. The dolsot bibimbap is good cus its not cheap beef chunks like some other places, but seasoned and juicy.<//Review>

Have you been to Jumbo Wang?

What?  Oh, it's Gombo Wang.  Silly me, my mistake ;p

If you haven't been to Gombo Wang, you should!

Located at a nondescript strip mall named Kim's Plaza, Gombo Wang is renowned for their housemade naeng-myun, which are cold buckwheat & arrowroot noodles.  Being closeby to me, it was only a matter of time before I set food inside Gombo Wang for their specialty dish.

Complimentary chicken broth-
Piping hot, the broth is made with chicken bouillon cubes & assorted vegetables, along with some chicken meat.  A savory & welcome alternative to tea.

Banchan-
I was asked if I wanted "many" banchan.  I was informed that noodle dishes traditionally only come with a couple banchan, whereas rice & other dishes come with many.  Without hesitation, I requested "many" because really, who wants less bang for the buck?

Hwe naeg-myun (regular-size)-
Cold buckwheat & arrowroot noodles in a spicy chili sauce, with hardboiled egg, pork, spicy Pollock (which is actually skate) & beef.  How can something so hot, be so refreshing at the same time?  Well, take me for example ;p BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA  Anyhoo, the housemade noodles had the perfect chewy consistency.  Diners can definitely tell the quality that comes with noodles made right after ordering.  The spicy chili sauce struck the perfect balance of sweetness & heat.  Sweat trickled down my bald head, but yet I was cooled at the same time by the cold temperature of this dish.  The various meat were good.  I have to warn you, the cuts of skate were on the tough side & included some bones & fins.  This was my first experience eating skate, and I enjoyed it, toughness and all.  Regular-size was the perfect amount for me, because between this, chicken broth & additional helpings of banchan, I was stuffed.  I ate most of the hwe naeg-myun w/o mustard & vinegar, in order to taste it unadorned, and then I added the two to see how they would change the flavor profile.  I must say, definitely add the mustard & vinegar, as they kick things up a notch tenfold!

Complimentary sikhye (rice dessert drink)-
I had to ask for this.  I nice sweet end to a Korean meal.

Service was great.  I was given a lesson on Korean culture, and how Gombo Wang ensures quality by making their noodles in-house, where other places simply buy premade noodles.  A quaint restaurant that can deceptively seat around 40+ people, the ambiance was clean, homey & inviting.  A flatscreen TV with Korean programming was on for diner's viewing pleasure.

Parking is located in the small Kim's Plaza strip mall.  Gombo Wang is on the left of the closed Laker Karaoke.

Gamsahabnida & well done, Gombo Wang!  Your much heralded naeng-myun did not disappoint & lived up to my expectations.  A cheap, affordable lunch of delicious food nearby to home means I'm going to be a frequent visitor, especially during the scorching hot days of summer when a plate of cold noodles will help me cool off from the heat.  Can't wait to try your bossam & other menu items!

Highly recommend!

(Translated by Google) The cold noodle taste is the taste and quantity which is different from the house which it is all right. The taste that you will find steadily! I would have to try other menus, but the cold noodles are so delicious, so I do not know when I can try other menus.

(Translated by Google) I was shocked to see the long nail polished manicured staff sitting at the table without gloves and making dumplings .....
I just ate all the dumplings ...
No matter how much heating, bacteria disappear ...
The atmosphere is cozy and friendly
The cold noodles are really good, so I'm going to give one star and give two

I would recommend this spot to the boys all day. Shopping was straight forward and easy.  We had a hick up with the part I purchased and the 2 guys that helped me made sure I was satisfied with their  business. Good job guys👍🏾

Easy to purchase engines here. I showed up in the morning as they were opening up. I was told to back up to the loading dock up against the building doors. It was placed in my truck bed via forklift. I tied it down and went inside to pay and off I went. I found it all very convenient. Maybe others have had other experiences. Now I just hope the engine is good:)</text>

JDM San Diego shipped me a transmission that had metal flakes in it and when installed did not work. It sat for a couple months and by the time I realized it didn’t work, my warranty was up by a couple months. However, they offered nothing for me and took no responsibility and just told me to “flush my oil” when the transmission had metal flakes in it BEFORE I even put it in the car. Now I’m out $560 and they have no customer service skills or offer of a replacement or even a partial refund. Very disappointed and feel ripped off. Talked to them on the phone and via email and they offered no consolidation. Also the email on their website was incorrect so it took even longer for me to contact them</text>

<review>While I didn't end up buying a motor from them directly, they were were extremely helpful throughout the time I was looking at various 1JZs they had in stock. I worked with Russell directly via text, and he was more than willing to answer all the questions I had and even send compression tests on many different engines I looked at - great customer service all around. I only didn't purchase an engine through them because I found an RB25 in my local area that was too cheap to pass up. I'll be coming back to this store if I need another engine in the future for any of my project cars.<//review>< rate>

I called to replace the engine on my 2007 Lexus RX 350 due to a bad oil leak. They had the engine in stock but after talking to me for a while he referred me to his mechanic to just get the engine fixed instead of replacing it. Their honesty saved me $2,000. Thanks guys! your mechanic Miguel you referred me to in spring valley is awesome also.< /Text>

<review>I worked with Jay at JDM.  Great customer service!  Initially, the driver delivered the wrong engine and made up some excuse that this was my engine even though the serial number did not match my invoice.  However, Jay offered to provide a replacement engine on their next shipment which caused my install project to be delayed by about week.  I received the JDM motor which at first looked a bit rusty on the outside, but overall looked good based on my mechanics inputs (i.e., no metal in oil or obvious leaks in any seals).  Had my mechanic install the JDM engine in my '01 Tacoma truck and after install, the truck started and roared like a new engine.  Ran the car for over 100 miles after replacing the engine with no issues! I am a very satisfied customer and recommend JDM San Diego to anyone looking for a Japanese replacement engine with less than 60k miles.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN1cMpjXNf9AIWW1UHf8LxTmTQoXlylenuRCLI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

Purchased a motor for my civix. They said it was a direct replacement motor. It was not a direct replacement motor.

So not only were they false advertising, they are also refusing to exchange or refund. Not professionals at all.

I understand mistakes are made, but refusing to make it right is unacceptable!~< /text>

Two months later, and my daughter's 4Runner is still running like new! The installation guy hit me up for an extra $100, but that was still MUCH cheaper than anyone else was willing to do. And I guess I should mention that the vehicle was delivered around 7:30PM on a Thursday evening, and I got a call at 10:00 Saturday morning saying the vehicle was ready to go.< /text>< Pictures>

I ordered a nose cut for a 2006 Acura TSX.  I received excellent service! I had excellent help. Before my part shipped they called me and notified me of a better option that matched color perfectly.  It shipped all the way to Kansas City! It was created well and I received exactly what a wanted!< /Review>

Bought a f20b full swap. Way cleaner than expected. Have worked with them in the past and they always go outta their way to make sure your happy. Couple years ago bought a t2t4 transmission from their other warehouse, casing was cracked when they looked over it. Then went outta their way to get me another transmission in just one extra day.

Not to mention the b20bs I've bought from them in the past for my turbo civic. Literally the only other place I'd go is hmo but jdm will make you happy for cheaper I promise that.</Text>

<text>I purchased a 5VZFE from these guys for my 1999 Toyota Tacoma and I could not have asked for a smoother transaction.  Russell was to the point, nice and very professional.   I payed over the phone and the engine was to me quicker than he quoted.  Upon inspection I was amazed at the great condition and cleanliness of the engine.  After swapping some parts over from the old engine it slipped right into the truck.  At first start I was amazed how smooth it ran.  Smoothest 5VZ I've ever heard! Been bout a mo with ZERO issues. All in all I would not hesitate to purchase another engine from these guys! If I could give more stars I would!< /text>< username>

False advertising of direct replacement motor! TURNS OUT IT WASNT. Now they are refusing to even work with me on replacement or refund.

Terrible - get from somewhere else that actually cares about fixing THEIR mistakes!~</review>

Called in and was able to find and engine that I was looking for. The 4age engines are getting harder and harder to find but they sourced one for me! Big thanks to JDM of SD and I really appreciate them going out of their way for that.</Review>

< review>
This place is garbage. Bought a transmission from them with 3 months warranty and i took it to the guy that installs the transmissions for them and it didn't work, and within those three months they kept giving me transmission after transmission untill the warranty expired and none of the transmissions they gave me ended up working. I went through like 3 or 4 or their transmissions and none of them worked. I know of about 5 people that have also gone there for motors and none of the motors they bought lasted even 5 months. Everything they sell is trash. Don't waste your time and money!!!!< /review>

<Review>I've personally never written a review like this before... But to start this off, Russle answered the phone and told me exactly what he had in stock off the back of his head. He knows his warehouse and he knows his stuff. Gave me a very excellent price on a front EK3 clip that I needed to complete a project that I'm working on at the shop. Now that i got my nose cut. I'm able to complete the job in my price range that I wanted to stick with.

Thanks to Russle!!<//Review>< Pics>

Best customer service in town.
#1 in San diego I am purchasing my 3rd engine from them and never had a problem all are still running strong till this day. Check them out top quality engines in San Diego. Stay away from the other jdm warehouses they are liers an have false advertisments.</Review>

I bought a bottle at an improved price. twenty cents higher from location I previously used; per gallon price is still reasonable.

<Time>1613605737900< /Time><response>None<//response><review>First off, a giant thank you to Mother Earth! I was called the day of delivery from another florist stating they wouldn't be able to deliver. In a panic, found Mother Earth, placed the order online and to my surprise, could do same day. I had nothing to lose. Even bigger shock, not only did they deliver same day, the arrangement was more beautiful in person. The delivery driver was very kind, maintained more than six feet distance, masked and just wanted to make sure it was the right address.

I will never use another florist...ever. In this day and age, I will support a business whole heatedly that stands by their work, gets you out of a jam that isn't even their doing and delivers on all of their word. I would give you ten stars if I could.<//review>< rating>

The arrangement was very beautiful and looked exactly like the picture (so It was exactly as expected). The arrangement was delivered in the morning, and the associate was very nice. Thank you so much!</review>

I sent my mom an arrangement from Mother Earth Flowers. You never know what you’ll get when ordering online, so I was skeptical. My mom sent me a picture when her arrangement arrived and they were absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!! Very reasonably priced and gorgeous flowers. I will use them again and would highly recommend!< /Text>

Amir and his staff are amazingly friendly, the arrangements are art pieces, and their service is top notch. I highly recommend them for all of your floral/delivery needs. I send A LOT of arrangements  in my role at work, and they always deliver smiles (literally and figuratively). Five star all the way!< /text>

Mother Earth Flowers always delivers beautiful & unique arrangements! We sent a cheery arrangement to a friend yesterday and her reaction was a huge smile, just what we hoped for. She was amazed at how unique and what a statement it made. Kudos to Amir and staff for gorgeous floral design!<//Review>

I ordered the premium version of the Limelight bouquet and it was beautiful. The recipient was very pleased. The arrangement was subtle and perfect for a sympathy setting. The website is easy to use and the flowers were delivered around 10:30 am so they will be enjoyed all weekend.<//text>

I am so happy I chose your flower shop versus other flower shops I've been to in the past.. your service and arrangements are by far the best I've seen and experienced!! You were very polite and knew the exact arrangement I was requesting and you accommodated the delivery time.. I greatly appreciate it..I will definitely recommend your shop and will continue to go to your shop for all flower services! 5 stars on yelp, google and all other reviews..thank you once again and see you soon ..

<text>I had knee surgery and a dear friend of mine who lives in Irvine took a chance and ordered flowers to be delivered to me. Not only was the bouquet one of the most beautiful I've ever received the kind woman who delivered it to me was amazing. World class service with world class flowers. Thank you Mother Earth Flowers! You've gained a new loyal customer.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Mother Earth is the best florist in south Orange County.  The owner, Amir, is unfailingly friendly, generous,and polite; he knows his flowers and always provides good service and good value.  I've tried others and no longer go anywhere but Mother Earth.   I'm pleased to be a long-time customer.<//review>

<text>Mother Earth Flowers and their owner Amir are amazing!  Amir has always done such a beautiful job with my flower orders.  He has helped me with Events, my fathers funeral to birthdays all with same day personal delivery.  Not only is his service amazing but his flowers last the longest I have ever had from a floral business.

I am so pleased that I was referred to Mother Earth Flowers when I needed to send flowers to my sister all the way across the country from me (I am in Georgia). Amir was so helpful and he was able to accomplish my delivery within two hours!  He even took a picture to send to me on my cell phone for my approval first. The arrangement was the most beautiful one that I have ever seen, and my sister called me to tell me how everybody there was raving about it!  Amir certainly goes above and beyond to please his customers!  I can see why Mother Earth is a thriving business and I wish him continuing success in the future!  Hope I get out that way sometime so I can stop in and see his lovely place!< /Text>

Amir said he would prepare a special arrangement for a friend's funeral. The final gift for a dear lady paid her great respect and Amir is to be recognized for his great sensitivity and creativity. A rating of 5 is far too low for Mother Earth Flowers; a 10+ is far more suitable. May God bless you and your employees. Trish Voss</review><date>1455473007930</date>< username>

I Was so impressed with Mother Earth Florist.  I had made arrangements for another florist to deliver to my friends mothers service. That company called me an hour before the service and told me they were running late and they couldn't deliver. At that point I decided to send something to my friends house I went online and was lucky enough to find mother Earth florist. I spoke with Amir Who was so understanding and made a special arrangement for my friend to be delivered to her house that same day.    When she received her flowers she sent me a photo. I couldn't ask for anything better they were beautiful and very special. Thank you for making a sad situation a happy one for her Amir.
Thank you

<Text>Today is my daughter's birthday, I called Amir and he arranged the most beautiful floral arrangement that I have ever seen.  What's more is that Amir had the arrangement sent to my daughter's office within the hour.  This is where I will ALWAYS buy my flowers in the future.
Outstanding arrangement, outstanding customer service!!
Thank you Amir you really out did yourself!!< /Text>< rating>

I love CEVICHE!!! This place is one of the best I have had. Everything there is made fresh same day, the ceviche is made to order. Always has some good specials to try, last time he had a mango jicama shrimp ceviche AMAZING. This is a local guy who knows his stuff. Very friendly. Tortas and street tacos are amazing too. Fair prices. This is the type of small local business that we need to support.</review>

To start, I’m a picky eater, so I wanted something quality and at a fair price. I drove 20 mins because I saw the good reviews, the food was honestly bomb, I like how they give complementary potato chips, my Torta was bomb the drive was worth it and customer service was good too, but my Adoba was burnt. Some of it was not all. But it had good flavor< /Text>

Very friendly, always clean, service is fast, inexpensive. Im not a sea food fan, so I always order the street tacos, but I hear the ceviche is awesome, along with the tacos. Small sitting area, unfortunately they close early, dont sell carne asada or rice but Its a must try spot wont disappoint.</Text>

This place is a hole in the wall. Was craving a nice cocktail but didn't want to go to my local joint as it comes off dirty. This place is the opposite with it's clean and simple layout.

But you wanted to read about the food. It's a 10/10.

Fresh. Tasty. Perfect.<//review>

<review>If you want authentic ceviche.  Or aguachile or coctails.  This is the place.  The tacos and tortas and burritos are very good.  The meat is always good and full of flavor.  Leo is the best.</review>< Pictures>

When the store is supposed to close at 8 we get there 20 til 2 and were almost refused service. "They had to be somewhere", but this wouldn't be the first time they all the sudden closed early. They do this way too often... In the end, they reluctantly agreed to take our order, but we had to get it to go. Fine, we took it to go, but I think we won't be coming back.</text>

I love it here! The people are always friendly and accommodating.  The ceviche is made fresh to order.  They also sell it by the pound, a must have for beach days with groups. Everything I have had here is great! The tortas, elote, and ceviche are awesome! Make note, they have no public restroom and they close early on Sundays (@4).< /Review>

The Campechana was ok only one third of the cup was sea food the rest was water and ketchup the shrimp were cut almost to 1/4 of an inch same with the octopus the bulk of the seafood was imitation crab. And NO Restrooms to wash your hand.

Pretty good place, cheap prices are a plus considering its seafood. Id say $3 for these tostadas is a good price, healthy and cheap!

Boy, this was great...all around good service, atmosphere, and mostly importantly Mexican!...menu is simple and effective..coming back here again within a week...for $5 you get a wonderful torta and chips...also offers tostadas and salads...probably worth up to $15 in a restaurant...hopefully this place survives</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very 👍 the shrimp cocktail with octopus 🐙 and the bean cake 👌 ... but the attention of the person who attends angry 😡 or tired 😫 does not say hello, does not smile, does not answer well what one asks !! Well it's my point of view ok

Muy 👍 el cóctel de camarón con pulpo 🐙 y la torta de frijoles 👌 ...pero pésimo la atención de la persona k atiende enojada 😡 o cansada 😫 no saluda no sonríe no contesta bien lo k uno pregunta!! Bueno es mi punto de vista ok<//Review>< Pics>

Food is really good but I called 7 times on Wednesday night and the girl would not pick up the phone. She was very weird about it when I asked after I got to the store.

If you are the owner, I would train your employees to pick up the phone otherwise you will loose business. We have many choices and we almost did not come because we wanted to order in advance.<//review>

Conceptually a good place, where you can grab a quick bite and continue shopping. But the food was below average at best.
Paneer pieces were huge and stale. Gravy was stale and lacked fresh flavor.< /review>

<Date>1609194843651</Date><Text>Conceptually interesting, a very promising approach to Indian cuisine. One star is because I just didn't like the food. Indian cuisine is vibrant, complex, fresh, flavorful, satisfying.  The meal I tried here was none of those things. The balance of flavors, textures and  tastes did not work.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dce762fdef9141:0x503f98c20724b39a</gmap_id>< UserId.>

This is definitely one of the finest place in the neighborhood. Always when I go there I am greatly glad. They always keep their high  standard service and the highest level of dishes  they give. You are always happy with this restaurant. Very  recommended.</Text>

So far the best indian taste with decent pricings around. I tried their moong daal halwa aka lentil dessert, kachori chaat, vada paav, paneer sabji and parathas. They were all very well made and delicious. I thought it would be plain paratha as they mention in menu but that was stuffed aalu paratha.  I wish the paneer was soft in paneer sabji but the gravy was tasty.The service is fast . I would definitely recommend this place.</text>

<review>Firstly, the location on the map is wrong. It does not show to this location. I am new to the area and it was super difficult to find it.
Secondly, the app is not updated with menu on ground. I ordered chai and they told me it’s not available. No hot beverages at all. It’s cold out here and should we drink only cold drinks?
Thirdly, the bournvita milk was cold. Who has it cold? The staff did not even heat it up. Disappointed<//review><response>None< /response><time>1615691458125</time>< userid>

<review>The Hella Vegan Burrito was Hella great! The perfect amount of spicy, savory and sweet and was very filling. As a runner I'm always hungry and  the burrito kept me full for hours. I appreciated the fusion style and new twists on classic dishes. *bonus* As a Vegan the restaurant knew exactly what was in each dish without hesitation, very reassuring.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dce762fdef9141:0x503f98c20724b39a</Gmap_id><username>Richard Keiser</username>< UserId.>

Attention everyone ! This is not how indian food tastes like. This is just some frozen, preserved and processed food. I would never come back. If I could give negative stars I would have given. The attender ate extra 6 dollars while billing us. It is not yet refunded. Very bad for children. Please don't promote and support this restaurant. Prices are unreasonable too.< /review>

Just tried Curry Up Now and the food is amazing! The Vada Pav truly tastes like the ones back home in Mumbai! The green lemonade was amazing and tasted like Aam Panna or Limbo Sarbat! Great customer service! Will definitely be back soon 👍🏽</Review>

It doesn’t become Indian food if you dump truck loads of masala and spice. The amount of masala & spice in your chaat is hazardous to health !! The Kathi rolls are tasteless. The Halwa is drenched / soaking in ghee.
I think you guys are trying too hard to be different and innovative but it’s definitely not working. I am definitely not coming back. :)</Text>

Vegan, vegetarian, keto, low carb, high carb, and paleo friendly! Food is yummy for fusion-ish Indian food.  Would definitely return.<//text>

They have a great menu with many options. Mainly chicken and lamb and also vegan options. We ordered chicken masala bowl, tiki masala burrito and kids chicken and rice plate. Everything was awesome and our service was impeccable. My daughter got a complementary milk and cookies. Their drink option is organic sodas and bottled Coke or Sprite. I would definitely go back to this place next time I'm in town.< /text><UserId.>116388852511056498603<//UserId.></record>

<Review>A very unpleasant first visit. I requested all my food to be vegan, as there are options on the menu. I ordered $35 worth of food to find out that they had cheese and meat. The "Sexy Fries" has a vegan option without cheese, but it came with paneer, even though the box had a "vegan" label. The vegan bowl "Peace, Love, Vegan" had meat in it. How big of a mistake you have to make to get them wrong? When getting the food, I even ensured with the cashier if all the food were vegan. He confidently ensured me that they were indeed vegan. For those who have dietary restrictions, please, open the boxes and literally check all your food before leaving the restaurant. As for me, I will never ever come back here again.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Wow this place is legit! We tried the tandoori chicken wings which had a good amount of heat and were cooked perfectly. My Shrimp Marsala was super flavorful and the naan was great! The papadams weren't greasy at all and my wife loved her eggplant curry (Baingan Bharta) as well. Owner was super friendly and I finally got a chance to try Flying Horse beer which was really refreshing! Will absolutely be back!< /text>

A different take on the traditional food. The menu, food and ambiance was interesting. Food is not bad either. Being in spectrum it is an option for an evening food joint.</Text>

Loved the Hella Vegan Samosa Burrito—large enough to feed two people, great flavor. The mint-ginger lemonade was delightful. Friendly and attentive staff. Looking forward to returning next time we’re in town.  (Please open a location in the southeast US!!)<//text>

I had the chicken tikka masala burrito. The flavor of the rice was gritting in the way of the chicken tikka masala. I think it would taste better with plain basmati rice and more sauce. Overall, I guess it works as a fusion, though I don't know why you would ever trade out a good naan bread for a tortilla. I think a naan taco would be much better. Sometimes it's better to leave things the way they are.</Text>

I’ve been here twice and both times they served burritos with very very very less meat. First time there was only two small pieces of chicken, second time very small portion of lamb keema was only at the bottom of the burrito. Distribute the meat evenly throughout the burrito!!! Compared to the Curry Up Now location in Bay Area, this one is ok, could be better. 1) Serve enough meat in orders, 2) Improve the taste a little, it’s just not the same quality tasty Curry Up as the Bay Area.<//Text>

I never write bad reviews but I am frustrated after visiting this restaurant. Do not go here expecting good Indian Street Food, you will be disappointed. First we ordered a kachori chat item. It was few pieces of kachori (that you get from store) crushed and served with touch of yogurt, chutneys and chana. Completely overpriced. Next, we thought of giving it a second chance and ordered a bowl of ghee Makhni butter (Paneer). A few bites and it reminds of a familiar taste. The Paneer was so rubbery we doubt it was even fresh. I hope they do not serve ready to eat food from the store. Overall a disappointing experience regards to food. Table next to us had got wrong order. There was lot of expectation, but it was disappointment and it's little overpriced compared to other Indian restaurants. Ambience is good but you don't want to see the word "Hernia" on the wall when you expect to enjoy your food. Hope you guys improve!< /Review>

This is an interesting take on Indian street food. It’s mostly Punjabi inspired dishes and some Indian favorites as well. The establishment is a bit snug with some outside seating as well. The service is quick. This was my second time visiting the restaurant. I had ordered the Meat Sweats thali dish, the samosas, and one of the lite thali dishes called Soup and Roll. For drinks I recommend a chai tea, which comes with sugar packs on the side and two vanilla cookies. The food is high quality, fresh and very delicious. The curries are indeed spicy in a delicious, tolerable and balanced way. Everything is very balanced in flavors and textures/consistency. Also, the plating is simple and neat. I highly recommend one of the thali dishes and the samosas.</Text>

<Review>After being to the northern California restaurant, was excited to have a local one. Almost an hour for some paneer fries, no communication between the front and kitchen. Food is pretty good, but items come spaced out 10-15 minutes.<//Review>< Pictures>

What is going on Curry up now. You served me chicken in vegetarian order.We are pure vegetarian people and we feel cheated .
Totally a let down.

I need to throw the entire order away. I cannot trust the authenticity of this food.

I am not coming here anymore.

<Review>They say deconstructed samosa as their best dish , i would say worst. No flavor,no taste
Ordered tikka masala with rice but the quantity of rice was so small.
Order a side of rice which took 10 mins to come to plate.
The person eating next to me got hair in his burrito.
Expensive, not worth even a try.</Review>< pictures>

Love Love the Paneer Tikka Masala Food.
Alex was so helpful helping me choose as I don't know a lot about Indian food other then I like it. Their Burittos are big, delicious & full of flavor.
I met the Manager, his name is Ali. He and Alex made me feel comfortable & welcome.  I will be coming here often as there are so many food choices to try and I work in the Spectrum. I will be telling my coworkers & friends.<//text>

Traditional Indian menu options presented with a twist is a deIight for the taste-buds. I had been to Curry Up Now in the Bay Area, and this location gets 5 stars as it checked all the boxes in my list . Out of many options, we tried kathi roll, chaar-papri, naughty naan, thaali and deconstructed samosa. Everything was delicious.👌👌Will be back again for sure<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

Indian street food with a contemporary twist is a welcome change from the ordinary. We tried sexy fries, kachori-chaat & paneer burritos on our first visit here about 2 weeks ago. This time we tried kathi roll, naughty naan, thaali & deconstructed samosas. The place was busy & but we didn’t wait long for the fresh hot food. Definitely will be back for more!!< /text>

<text>This place is pretty nice looking and well stocked with a variety of hobby games. As for the staff, they are very laid-back and fun. They were very knowledgeable about their products. The atmosphere feels like it’s ran by friends hanging out more than some dry shop owner. I have been looking around for different shops in my surrounding areas and this one is my second favorite. This place is definitely worth giving a shot, it just might become one of your favorites shops as well.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

Friendly staff and great selection of Magic: The Gathering and D&D products, not to mention lots of other board games. This place has single-handedly kept my MTG addiction alive throughout the pandemic with their quick and easy online ordering and in-person pick-up. Great communication with customers and they do a wonderful job of running FNM-at-home through Discord.<//Text>

First of all, I am glad that their employees aren't a bunch of stuck up hipster folk like a few other stores around this block. Props to them for that staying chill and always wanting to lend out a helping hand right when you enter the store.< /Review>< pics>

Aw, these guys are so cute!  I used to come in a lot more when I was a full blown comic book addict.  Now, I only visit when I'm in that neck of the woods, which is rare.< /Text>

Found this neat store on our way back from an outing and really enjoyed it. The store’s a little on the smaller side but the staff gave great suggestions and they had a variety of board games and paints/figures. Will definitely be going back.</text>

<Text>Turn Zero is absolutely fantastic! I don't love anywhere near here, but I try to spend as much time here as possible. It truly is the best place for Magic in the LA area, IMO.

Other shops play other games and you never know if anyone will be playing your game fee when u you walk in the door. At Zero we grind Magic, and at a pretty high level compared to any other shop I've been to. This is the place to develop your skills and get better at the game. Parking's a challenge, but where isn't it in LA? Though there are some nights where you luck into a good spot on Wilshire (free parking after 7!) or in the small lot behind the shipping center.

Great environment, friendly staff, huge inventory (they carry most Ultimate Guard products,) and open until midnight. The gold standard of shops I've been to so far.</Text>< Pictures>

Easy to come solo or with a buddy to find others to make a foursome or more to play Magic, Dungeons and Dragons or other card and board games.  Helpful staff.

Great players hang out there and awesome staff there as well, the primary game played is MTG. If your looking for a place to drop off your kids be prepared, if they don't have decks to play with, then either help pay for a current deck or find someplace they don't have yo worry about it. The best thing to do is to is ask  which deck is currently being used and the general length it would be used before before a replacement.< /Text>

I am the first to review woo! This place totally does weird stuff, like have regular drafts, a staff thats knowledgeable about magic, and have regulars that are cool people and there to play some cards. It's also so weird that there is plenty of food places and parking and great prize payouts and reasonably scheduled events, I mean who does that. The weirdest thing is that the owner actually listens to his customer base and acts accordingly. By you if you haven't figured it out, weird is actually awesome, cuz this store is awesome! so come through if you're in the area!</Text>

Great service. From scheduling the appointment to the professionalism of their techs. The results were outstanding, and as promised - carpets were dry in two hours. The techs were super informative, professional and thorough. I'll never use another company again. Highly recommended.</text>

<review>Great service. Carpet was very clean afterwards, and it only took about 90 minutes to dry completely. Not sure exactly how they do it, but whatever it is they're doing, it works.

<Text>I have 2 dogs and they really did an awesome job by removing the carpet stains and smell. They left the house feeling like new and it dried quickly. I used a different carpet cleaning company before and they did a horrible job, leaving the carpets wet and unable to remove pet odor. I will continue to use this company to clean my carpets, they have made a believer in me! Love the service and most of all the finished product with the use of Oxy Fresh. They have exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend them and continue to refer them to family and friends!</Text>< pics>

< Review>
Albertsons has the BEST Bakery of any grocery store in the valley. They have a large selection of every food item category. Also, their checkout attendants are always so efficient and pleasant. The store is always so clean and inviting. I really enjoy shopping at Albertsons.</Review>

<review>Really friendly team. I even ordered a cake and cupcakes for my sons birthday and they were all good. The only thing I was not so excited about was that the cake wasn't how I asked it to be, but it was really tasty so I didn't complain about it.</review><Rate>4< /Rate>< Name>

<rate>5<//rate><text>This location just happen to be across the Hwy from our hotel in Palm Desert, California when we went on a short vacation.  As soon as my hubby noticed the Albertson's sign,  he was glad as he was going to go & find me some acetaminophen,  which is of course,  at the Albertson's Pharmacy.  A very nice & organized store,  friendly staff,  courteous, knowledgeable & helpful.  And of course, my favorite go-to qu ick meal from the Deli Dept.- Freshly Fried Chicken - & Loaded Potato Salad,  delicious and made in house!  Albertson's fried chicken is the best!!!< /text>< pics>

This is for delivery/pickup reviews. 1st delivery order, 5 HOURS LATE! Poor communication about status. Had to call them twice. I understand we are not the only people wanting delivery, but they should not offer delivery time windows if they can't actually meet the customer expectations. 2nd order was for pickup, 2 hours late, poor communication about delay. Then, all of our items from the dairy aisle were marked as 'out of stock'. I highly doubt that as we allowed substitutions. (out of all shredded cheese, no bacon at all, etc????). I think the shopper just did not want to go back for those items as it was already after 8pm. This is not fair to the customer. Positives: fruits and vegetables were of very good quality. Expiration dates were good. These are difficult times and I am sure their staff is hustling, but better planning on their end with good communication to the customer would have given us a better experience.</Text>

When I went to pay the person at the register was super friendly as well. It’s not too often lately that you receive great customer service but I was pleasantly surprised. Keep up the good work and give those people a raise.< /text>< userid>

Was pretty busy this morning as everyone is getting ready for Thanksgiving. A little more crowded than I cared for, but I went in and out as quickly as possible. Cashier and bagger were very pleasant. Staff was busy keeping shelves stocked, the flower department is very well stocked with beautiful holiday arrangements. I would have given a 5 but being to crowded was a negative.< /text>

<review>I have been going to this grocery store since I was little since my parents live right up the street. We have always had such a good experience and we all have the app (I live down the street from my parents because I love them) and do the just for you etc. I want to give 5 stars BUT I can’t because every time my family and I get Lisa as a checker, the entire experience becomes a negative, sad time. Every other checker asks how you are or just actually responds when I ask how they are doing. I’m not saying fire her, just maybe try to train her to have an ounce of happiness or politeness when interacting with customers. Beside that, love this store!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Every time we are in town stop here and they overcharge or shortchange is by the time we get home it’s too much of a hassle to return to the store.  The fruit section had old fruit and looked so dirty. This store is either Pocketing the change on tourist as a inside job or they are lacking training on basic math counting. We will not be back and recommend Ralph’s much cleaner much better fruit!<//text>

Fresh meats fresh vegetables. Great prices. But needs more cashiers during holidays. But the employees are very friendly.</Review>

<Text>I have never been to an Albertsons so big before. It is huge and has so many choices my head spun. Great parking, unbelievable service. Great deli , meat department, so many beers and wines, bakery . Really if you're in the area and need to go grocery shopping give this market a try . It's to much to describe. Hope you like it.<//Text><user>101254337886231592211<//user><Name>fiorenzo demarco</Name>< GmapID>

As far as grocery stores are concerned Albertsons is always a decent place to go. The staff is usually very friendly and helpful and they could the lines moving. Everything is kept extraordinary really clean especially during this crisis with the covid-19. I shop here all the timeand they even have a bike rack for me to lock up my primary mode of transportation which is a big deal for me. Easily accessible off of highway 111 however you get here it's a great place to shop.< /review>

Thank you.  Nice, clean grocery store with plenty of stock.  We are from NC and I really enjoy finding things we don't get on the east coast.  It's been 27 years since my last visit.  Hope to see you much  sooner!  CA is gorgeous!<//review>

This is a well organized store. The produce is impressively fresh.  The selection of the dairy section is great. Their store managers are helpful, helping  me see the best deal esspecially  for the liquor prices.  I will take pictures next time. So overall the store is older looking but the service is great.</text>

•This particular Albertsons at the cross streets of Deep Canyon & Hwy 111 is the closest grocery store to me & that convenience is primarily, why I go there. •The store is clean. •The  clerks are friendly and helpful   --->(not all for sure, though most).
•I do most of my shopping at a warehouse store as I find it more economical; however, they don't sell everything I need, so I go to Albertsons. Great parking too.</Text>

While at this Albertsons,  there were 3 teens in the store without masks (which is now mandatory by LAW).  I said something to them. When I got to cashier & mentioned it. She spoke to the manager who said he'd been told, but he's not the police. I'm sorry. His job is to enforce it, if not on principle,  then to protect his employees AND customers. Otherwise people will feel they have a choice because it's not being enforced. Other grocery stores are enforcing,  so I won't be back here.<//Text>

<Text>Your mileage may vary Depending on time of day for the most part staff is very friendly it's an Albertsons location so everything is pretty good but not excellent. This place gets strangely super busy in spurts and at one moment it could be empty and by the time you're done everyone somehow appears at the cash register line. They do their best to stop extra registers when this happens but it does happen quite a bit.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The veggies and non-perishables are good. However, the meat selection has failed me twice now. First, it was chicken breast that went bad the day after I purchased it.  Now, it’s a $9.00 steak that looked great from the top. But once I got it home to grill, I flipped it to season and discovered a whole backside of fat that I had to cut off.  This is very aggravating.<//review>

<review>By far my favorite grocery store! Used to be Walmart lol. Great prices, staff is always friendly & a few weeks ago they had a watermelon eating contest for the shoppers to join in on! Which is thought was different but awesome.</review><Response>None<//Response>< Rating>

Kudos for biggest and (abeit subjectively) best Grocery Store on highway 111 in the entire Coachella valley. The workers feel like friends the management like family. Always willing to help and 3's a crowd so very seldom do I wait. They have free customer wifi and a coffee bar as well as Bank located in the front. Beautiful bakery and meat Department and amazing floral displays plus money services. The only issue I have is the fact they took away their recycle center last year. Come on Albertsons youre the biggest grocery conglomerate in the world let's go green!< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>12-14-19  I Will never use this store again.  Deep Canyon Palm Desert.  4 different times I have made an order with the service deli.  Every time they either lose my order or it is not made and ready when I go to pick it up.  I have spoken with the manager and his excuse is that they have new employees.  Sorry, not a good enough excuse for not doing your job!! My time and money will never be spent at this location again.  Poor management and staff to say the least.

Conveniently located. Clean. Open until midnight, which is great for avoiding crowds and allows for relaxed shopping. Many sales, especially when purchasing in bulk (usually 4-5 of same item). Friendly and helpful staff. Assistance to vehicle after checkout. Ready-to-serve foods for a quick dinner. Always well stocked.< /Review>

Good atmosphere, good drinks, great food, only reason I did not give this place five stars is because of their limited items on the menu. There is not much variety, and not a whole lot of options. With that being said, still a great place, still great for tye traveling variety. I would come again. (Their burgers are great, too)<//Text>

Best store for bakery. Tasty fresh bread. Cakes are fresh, delicious and beautiful.  Good for balloons, plants and flowers. Expensive for wine and other spirits, even with the 6 bottle discount. Go to Ralph's or stater brothers for beverages. Rest of groceries are expensive here as well. Don't know why but checkers.are not as.friendly here as other stores.< /Text>

Very clean and nice store. Only a couple of nice checkers at this store. One incident at the check stand I could have complained about sexual harassment. Coupons always missed and don't ring up right. Prices are high and it is close to me so I go.<//review>

Eric was one of the most helpful managers I have dealt with at any store, he helped me find what I was looking for and was very professional. He definitely is manager and District supervisor material and I don't even know the guy, but it takes one to know one!<//Text>

<text>This place is amazing! It may be a little bit higher priced than others but they make up for it in quality service from staff & geniuely nice people. Romero is a great guy who is always happy to see you & makes you feel welcomed. This is why I'd rather go to Albertsons than walmart, they know my name here, they ask how I've been & geniuely care about your needs. I'd give them 10 stars if I could, the deep canyon store is the best Albertsons I've ever been too, hands down. Thank you guys.</text>< pictures>

I gotta give it to them for their fresh delicious sushi. I think it's the best store bought sushi I've ever tasted made fresh every morning. Other then that it's  Simple. Basics you can get at a value but other things can get pricy.< /review>

I wish ai could leave a lower score than a 1*.  My niece and her fiancé had a horrible experience there today. They are vegans for many reasons and they picked up a healthy fresh salad today for lunch. When the got to the bottom there was a healthy meaty bug LARGE just laying in with the bottom greens, very dead. I hope to be able to post photo. They responded by bringing a new salad and $3 off coupon towards next purchase! OMG!  Be aware!  Disgusting!</Review>

A little on the pricey side, but a much better alternative than Whole Foods. The deli always has something good and you can find most of what you're looking for, even a lot of organic items.< /Review>

Albertsons is never my first choice for groceries shopping, but this location is nice, clean. Find almost everything I need. Clearance/ markdown section on a back. Employees are very friendly since its close to hotel row and lots of tourists and snowbirds shop here.</Review>

That's fine that your prices are quite a bit higher than Walmart. I was totally shocked because I hadn't been in Albertsons for a while.</Text>

Too expensive. Smart&Final and Walmart neighborhood market are both at least 2.00 less than Albertsons. Take Hebrew National hot dogs as an example. 5.99 at Albertsons 4.00 at Walmart.< /text>

Very useful for arranging midnight snacks, etc.
There is also a pharmacy inside the store, so you can also get sanitizers (alcohol gel) for disinfection.

<Review>(Translated by Google) It’s not surprising to sell anything!
The supermarket is spacious and it’s really comfortable to go shopping.
