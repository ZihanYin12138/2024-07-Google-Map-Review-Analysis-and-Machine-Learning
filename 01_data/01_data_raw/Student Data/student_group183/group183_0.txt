< Review>
Excellent service, it took less than 10 minutes to get my car inspected. The shop is very clean. They are also taking extra care with hygiene due to the coronavirus restrictions. You can get a good discount if you bring a coupon. The coupon is available for download in their website. You have to print it out and bring it with you.<//Review>

Had two vehicles checked for DMV Reg. and was finished in 20 minutes including paperwork.  Also, operator pointed out minor mechanical problem but one that did not impact the result.  He was professional and skilled.  I like dealing with pros that provide excellent service.  Price was right.</Text>

When I came here last week, I was greeted with friendly customer service and a very well prepared service. They had all the information needed ready so I got in there and was out right away. It's really nice to be able to go to a place where you don't have to wait for hours on end.  Their location is very easy to notice right off of Hacienda and Winchester.

Definitely will be returning I now the future!!<//Review>

< Review>
Showed up, was told 15 minutes. Saw several cars being checked that were in bad condition. I'm a major car enthusiast. The service guy asked me "how many miles on the car ?" And I asked what that had to do with it. He then told me (knowing nothing about the car) (totally stock Benz in 99% perfect condition, with 99,000 miles no errors or codes or anything) that he needs a 100% pass rate to maintain his status. I drove away. 0 stars. I'm at another station close by and I asked for a smog. This is also a star station. He said "yes, sir" and got to work. I'll post a separate review of the place I'm now at.</Review>

Quickest service you can get for your car! I was here for 10 minutes and was done before I even knew it. If you use a yelp check-in you get a discount as well which I recommend! This is a very fair priced establishment and you get your money's worth. 5/5< /text>

Every time I come to fast smog, it is always a quick and pleasant experience.  The staff is very friendly and polite.
They also have a very clean waiting room with magazines to keep you busy.  You won't read long because it did not take me more than 20 minutes<//Text>

These guys sure do live up to their name.  They got my service done in 15 minutes, about as long as it took me to write this review.  They can get any car done and and know what they are doing.  They act very professional and were extremely friendly.  I had a great experience here!<//review>

I've been taking my cars here for years, and they make the painful process of Smog Check as easy as possible.  Fast friendly service! They usually take the time to explain the readings to you as well... good indicators for how well your car is running.

<review>Excellent Service, from start to finish." the Technicians are very well educated in their field, and the service up front was fantastic. it is awesome to go to a shop that is locally owned, and doesn't make you feel like you're an idiot, and that you are about to get ripped off. I was once a General motors technician, and I don't divulge that information when I meet new mechanics, and they treated me with respect from the get-go. I didn't get anything major done to my vehicle, but my experience was great and care free all the same!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I was recommended to go to Fast Smog by a close friend, and now I will tell all my friends about this place.  I was there for less than 20 minutes, with no problems whatsoever.  A very pleasant experience!< /Text>

<review>Eric and chris were extremely friendly, helpful and they went above and beyond with the smog check. The whole process was done in 10 minutes.  A nice bonus is that they are involved with charities and very supportive of them. Getting this smog was a very pleasant experience and you can bet I will be coming back!</review><gmap_id>0x808e3504feb896f9:0xf23887ef10b7bf6b<//gmap_id><Name>Shaun Jeferno<//Name><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

I used to go to a couple other places for a smog but none of them are compareable to Fast smog. This place is my new go to. They are the best priced and the fastest. You really do get your money's worth here. I recommend going here to everyone that wants good work! 5 out of 5< /Text>

<Review>Had 4 visits to Fast Smog with 2 different cars over the last few years, came back with one of them and upon a look at my car kid behind the counter said "I don't think we can do your car, is it stock?" I said the engine is entirely stock. He apparently didn't care, because he looked up my plate and said the car had failed previously so he wouldn't test it. It's not like there aren't a handful of other places to get tested, but apparently my car wasn't good enough for his 2 unused test machines. So if your preference is to go someplace reliable and consistent, this isn't it.<//Review>< date>

I never write reviews but it was much needed after going here. I cleared my schedule and took time off work so I could get the car I just bought smogged. I was expecting it to take up a good portion of my day, but boy I was wrong.  I was there for about 10-15 minutes and got everything done in that time. While waiting in the waiting area, I had a pleasant conversation with one of the employees, which made my visit that much better. I'll will 100% be coming back here.< /Review>

Found this place online while running errands and I couldn't be happier with their service.

Upon my arrival, the manager told me that he could have my car tested in 15 minutes or less, and to my surprise, he was right.

I explained that I just came from the DMV and he ensured me that I get the necessary tests and documentation to have me on my way.

Great service, price, and location... 5 stars!< /text>

I have no idea how good the smog service here because the tech would not test my car. He said "I've done enough old cars today." I said I'll come back tomorrow when you open. He further objected. He then started in about how there was a new system in place and CA board of auto repair would punish him if he passed cars that subsequently failed.  What? I took it to another shop, Smoguys in San Jose, where my car passed by  a wide margin.

At one point he said take it to your mechanic. I am my car's mechanic. The irony is that he had a black plate already in a bay.

I guess this business just does not need the money.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< username>

< review>
Eric is amazing! The wife got her car smogged with him last year and had a great experience. I made the unfortunate mistake of taking my car to a closer smog station because I assumed it would pass with no issues (2010 Porsche Cayman low miles). BUT I was wrong. Some air monitor thingie wasn't working idk. 2 techs in 3 trips to this other smog station and they kept giving me the wrong advice. Car wouldn't pass! Hopeless the wife suggested I call Eric. Thankfully this is one of the few times I listened to my wife. I guess with car stuff the macho ego kicks in, but anyhoo....I called Eric AKA Smoggy Magic and he talked me through my issue and said if I couldnt solve it to bring it to him. ALSO....what I am super grateful for is he texted me a link to some monitor I could use. HOW ABOUT THAT! He went out of his way to text me a link and I wasnt even a customer. You dont get service like that these days and it is refreshing to have someone go out of their way to help with nothing to gain. WE THE WORLD NEEDS MORE PEOPLE LIKE ERIC! I highly recommend Fast Smog. Eric didn't choose the Smog life, the Smog life chose him!!!< /review>

II started coming here in 2006 and I've never looked back. Let's be real!! No one remembers their first smog, I mean to be honest everyone hates getting their car smogged, California sucks! When I came to fast smog it was a little bit different......Just a little! I mean getting my car smogged still sucked, but the smog tech Erik who serviced my car made it much better than any of my previous experiences. When they say fast they mean it, my car was done in 10 minutes which was amazing which kept me coming back for years. I purchased a new vehicle a few year ago which allowed me to skip the process for some time. When the lovely state of California notified me I had to get my new car checked out I went back to Fast Smog, to my surprise Erik was still working there. The whole experience was exactly how I remembered, the place was clean, he got me in and out, and even gave me a deal based on a local promotion that had been running even though I didn't have a coupon. All in all the experience was great, and although no one wants to get their car smogged when I have to I will go to Fast Smog in Campbell. Ask for Erik if he still works there.< /Text>

Very bad experience with this shop.  I called a let one of the owners know that I was bringing my truck down to get smogged. I have been using this place for many years and they have smogged my other vehicles so I usually like going to one place.  I get there and the owner gives me a long diatribe on why he NOW doesn't want to smog my vehicle because of it's age, even after he knew that when I called. After taking off work and driving an half hour to his shop I am completely dumbfounded why he didn't tell me that on the phone after he looked me up in his records. Very unprofessional and downright RUDE IMO!

I didn't know any other shop in the area so I poked around on my phone and found Accurate Smog Check on Curtner and they were super friendly on the phone, said they would smog any vehicle and they could do it that time as I wait. Got there, was greated by a really nice person behind the counter and the WHOLE EXPERIENCE was totally different that Fast Smog.  The owner there smogged my vehicle and was very informative on the process for older vehicles and I left there knowing more  than I knew when I got there, very good experience overall.</Text>

They have what's called a "Food Lab", where they concoct new recipes and ideas every day for their customers. A Russian man that smelled like vodka, and a buff man named Brett joined me on my meal. Brett was nice and told me their food is of the highest standard. The Russian man kept puking all over the waiter named Jakob, but that's okay. Gordon Ramsay WHO? Don't even waste your money on him. COW CHOP KITCHENS IS WHERE IT'S AT!!!! SPOIL YOUR PIGGY BANK HERE!!!</Text>< Pictures>

Absolutely fantastic! Took the family for a day out and we had a great time. We all got a goodie bag of cannabis and the nice Asian man with the glasses was giving out free kisses or something in the bathroom. Kids loved it, great atmosphere.</text>

Food was good, but they need to learn the difference between medium rare and medium well. Otherwise, great service.
The waitress helping us was just wonderful, I think her name was Leslie. Great gal!<//Review>

Great experience with Service Master. Chose them based on the many 5-star reviews. Did not disappoint. Team was able to tackle some tough upholstery stains w/ ease. Service was on-time, performed professionally and at reasonable rate! Recommend without hesitation!!</Text>

<text>We are new to the Palm Springs area and feel so fortunate to find this company.  The workers were here right on time.  They were ready to get the job underway as soon as I gave them the instructions.  They were polite, informative and did a great job at my home.  I will definitely be calling them again.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

This should be called “miracle”carpet cleaning. I had some extreme spots in the carpet after some construction projects, plus other old spots. Service Master got every one of them out. My carpet is 24 years old and now looks very close to new. I am beyond happy with the outstanding job they did!!<//text>

I called ServiceMaster of the Desert, spoke with Leslie and told her that I wanted all the carpets cleaned in the entire house.  She asked some questions, and having been to our house before, gave me a quote over the phone.  Two technicians showed up at the agreed upon time, and the rest is history.  They did a fabulous job.< /Review>

Tucking in the bed skirts so they wouldn’t absorb any moisture,  turning on the fans for quick drying ( I was not home) and  ring extra considerate of the home. Lesslie was great in setting the appointment at short notice. Highly recommend.<//review>< pics>

I highly recommend Service Masters! My first impression of booking my appt through Lesli was the beginning of a seamless process. She is knowledgeable, professional & thorough. They are tech savvy in keeping their customers informed & reminded of future appointments.
Steve arrived on time, went above & beyond to meet our carpet cleaning needs & the pricing was very fair. It’s wonderful to know there’s still quality, locally owned companies that really care about the exceptional work they do for homeowners and companies alike. Thank you to the community on the NextDoor App for referring Service Masters!</Text>

Service Master of Palm Desert came to clean up my rug & did my kitchen for free 😍.  I have just acquired a small dog and I was happily surprised how my rug looked after they steamed cleaned my carpet.  The guys called to see if they could start working on my rug one hour early, which I LOVED. I was truly amazed how beautiful my rug looked. I would recommend Service Master to anyone that has an issue with their rugs.

This was my first experience with Service Master of the Desert. Steve and Leslie were extremely responsive to my calls and questions. Due to Covid-19, we had to reschedule a few times. The work was completed last week. It looks like we have a brand new home. The floors look amazing.

I would highly recommend this business.<//Text>

I have used them several times and they never disappoint.  Always on time and do a beautiful job.
They are always mindful  and respectful for our home. I was so impressed to see they protected my wall corners with a fitted  cone. Believe me , that goes a long way with someone with a Type A personality! I love that they use long time employees and not " random subs"... Thank you, ServiceMaster!!</Review>

Our contractor had ServiceMaster clean the windows at the completion of construction.   They did an amazing job.    We just had them back to do the windows again at our cost and it was every bit as good.   This is a professional crew.< /text>

Wouldn’t use anyone else for carport &/ window cleaning in the Coachella Valley!
Have been a satisfied customer of Service Master of the Desert for 25 yrs.
Lesli & her crew do an amazing job , are accommodating & always prompt.
She’s taken care of my two units in Palm Springs and is one of the rare business owners that stands behind her work. I wish I could take her w me on my move.
Will not disappoint ;)<//Review>

Steve, the owner, took over my project. Besides being professional and timely, he’s most courteous and truthful in not wanting to attempt to clean an item as he didn’t feel it would make a significant difference.
Definitely sharing this source with clients and friends.< /text>

This isn’t the kind of impersonal company that seems to busy to be responsive to you. Even though they ARE busy, they are a family that responds in a quick and human way. It feels like they are doing such a good job because they care about their customers like we are their friends and they definitely care about the quality of their work in your home.< /text>

<Text>ServiceMaster of the Desert did a fantastic job cleaning my windows. Steve and Brad were prompt, thorough, and completely professional. Windows and doors are spotless and look amazing. Also, the amount of communication (for confirmations, reminders and updates) from the time I made the appointment until the job was complete is perfect. I highly recommend the company. Thank you!< /Text><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

<review>These guys are super heroes!  I moved into a new office and the landlord's crew had cleaned the floors but it was still so filthy.  I called Servicemaster of the Desert and they had a cancellation with enough time to do a great job.  They steam cleaned and polished my cement floors so that the floor looks great - and it's really clean.  They were very careful with my stuff and worked quickly to get the job done!

Been using ServiceMaster now for years after referred by a friend. Their professionalism, ethic, involved and courteous owners, and staff are absolutely terrific. Windows and screens are absolutely spotless after having no attention for a full six months and carpet cleaning knowledge is unmatched. Great people as well!</Text>

Wow!! These guys were fantastic! Firstly, I could book online. Nice. The owner called to confirm my appointment and make sure I had no questions. The service guys showed up on time.... polite, friendly and very hard working! They really knew their stuff and did a few extra jobs that they could see needed doing like tightening a handle on a window, cleaning a small mat. My house sparkles! I can highly and happily recommend this company and I will certainly be using them again!< /Review>

The staff at Minuteman Press Sand Creek Rd location were magnificent! I strongly recommend their services!

I am a new business owner. I opted to use Minuteman Press after an array of online print shops provided confusing and misleading pricing information, garbled my orders, and/or provided proofs of products that were incorrect or inadequate to address my needs.

The staff at Minuteman Press, Sand Creek Rd, Brentwood instantly swept away the new business owner chaos I was feeling and were attentive as they  listened to my uncertain explanations of the products I required to launch my company. The whole staff brainstormed ideas with me and made suggestions. And then they allowed me countless revisions and proofs of their work prior to printing my order. Most importantly, they made the whole process fun and enjoyable!

The combined cost of the products I received from M.M. Press was far less than the total price the online retailers were trying to charge me; and I received a far higher quality product in which every detail was perfected before it was printed. I wholeheartedly recommend Minuteman Press on Sand Creek Rd in Brentwood, CA. !!! Their employees embody the small town spirit of the community and breath new life into the idea of service with a smile!< /Review>

Antonio is very good at what he does and puts care into his profession.
I can also rely on Terry to do a great job with cutting my my smaller prints.
Highly recommend!</Text><UserId.>102643091749348238459< /UserId.><gmap_id>0x808ff8d6133ccbf7:0x2e9157d01890b11e</gmap_id>< name>

Love the staff at Minuteman Press.   I had to make a “memorial board” for an upcoming high school reunion which included copying part of my 30 year old high school yearbook.   I was unsure on where to start.    They gave me some great ideas, copied the pictures I needed and I was well on my way!   I will definitely be using their store time and time again.< /Review>

One kept blaming the other, Jean, Bob, and Jeremy kept shooting me different quotes and asking for more money and refused to do the work for the agreed upon price. I’m very disappointed because I like their products but they can’t seem to get their internal workings right. A company should take more responsibility in ensuring accuracy and honoring their prices.</Text>< gmapID>

< Review>
I was married this past April and had trouble finding exactly what I wanted for my wedding invitations. I spent a few months looking everywhere you could imagine- online, in bridal stores, etc. and could not find something simple enough but with the romantic and elegant feel. I had heard of Minuteman for business cards and more corporate products but never heard anything about wedding invitations. They are right around the corner from my house so I decided to walk in and see if they could work with me to make what I had in mind. I am so happy I decided to walk in as I had my invitations made here and they were exactly what I wanted and for half the price of anything else compared online. Natasha was very easy to work with and took the time (overnight) to run a mock-up of what I described to make sure I loved what I was buying. It was such a great experience and I received numerous compliments about the invitations. My sister's wedding was 5 months after mine and she also went to try Minuteman and loved what they did for her too. Mine invitations were more simple with an elegant feel and my sisters where actually created into fans for guests to cool themselves while sitting outside. Minuteman and Natasha did an outstanding job working with my sister and I and we are both extremely happy with how our invitations came out. Thank you, Minuteman! I will definitely be back for more as events come my way.</Review>

Her experience was very helpful to me. My daughter in law was so happy with the end results. Everyone had commented on how adorable the invitations were! I would definitely use Theresa and minuteman press again, and will recommend her to anyone planning a party!< /text>

If you need anything printed, I mean anything, this is the place. I can send a "link" to my material, schematics, laminated charts, participant guides, everything for my classrooms, all over the state, it is mailed and usable by class time. Very good company, I recommend them highly ,

For many years Minuteman Press has handled my printing needs for:
* my Downtown high-end retail business
* the Downtown Brentwood Coalition
* public affairs events and media needs for a large regional church

And as I have referred countless other businesses, organizations and persons to Minuteman Press, Bob has always taken extra care with them and provided them with the same timely, professional and effective product and service that he has provided for my needs.  He is a RockStar!<//Text>

My first service from this company was great (Posters printed for an event I held in 2017); however, this last experience (business cards) was a little discouraging.  My order took too long to process, and once I received it, my card design was incorrect.  But I took them home anyway, because I needed them.</text>

Woman had an attitude, answered phone calls in the middle of us talking and then had to repeat myself. Left two photos she said they would be done by the end of the day. They were not ready so I came back mid day the next day still we’re not ready. Woman gave attitude again. I was leaving to go across the country that evening and I took my photos back and went else were. Just a very dissatisfying visit.<//Text>

Not NY style, not Cali, or traditional style. More like a round grandma style, no outer crust. Floor to ceiling toppings. Tons of cheese, tons of pepperoni. Next time I feel like being self destructive I will order again, maybe the meat lovers, or Supreme. Yumm< /text>

This pizza is delicious. I tried The Everest. The pizza is a little pricey but it is worth it in my book. You will get little packets of parmesan cheese and red pepper with your order. Try their pizza-delivery or carry-out is available.<//review>

Worse Mountain Mike's experience we have ever had. They flip flopped the pizzas and made them wrong. We asked for extra sauce.. It seems they deliberately put NO Sauce on the pizza. We will never eat here again.At other MM locations the pizza is 🔥. Not here. We just wrote the 60 bux as a loss, we will never go back. Just wanted to give a heads up to anyone thinking of ordering from here... DON'T.<//text>

Pizza was  dry. No sauce hardly, pizza was very thick and doughy and chicken on pizza looked boiled and unseasoned  Almost 40 bucks for 2 pizzas i ended up throwing it out.  Will not eat here again.< /text>

I told everyone Mountain Mike’s was THE best pizza around BY FAR!  but lately it’s been pretty bleh. In the last few months we’ve placed 4 orders every time it’s been mediocre.  It’s sad when I think back to when it opened and I thought it was the greatest pizza in the IE. I look forward to the day I get to taste one of the incredible Mountain Mike pizzas again. ☹️< /Review>

<text>We used to eat Mountain Mike's Pizza in Paradise, CA before the 2018 Campfire. We've been craving some bomb pizza for awhile so when I found a location 1.5hr from our new home I decided to drive out for some great pizza. I forgot to call ahead and order but the girl at the counter was fine with taking the order and even let me and my son wait inside in the A/C for our pizza. The pizza was perfect 1/2 pineapple chicken Iuau, 1/2 pepperoni! Exactly how delicious I remember. Mountain Mikes is my favorite pizza place, I wish there was a location hear Palm Springs,C A.</text><user_id>103492446427767375178<//user_id><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x80db63782d70fb19:0xfef41c80d85da8b2< /gmapID>< pics>

<Text>We stopped in to pick up our pizza order the other day, and saw several employees in the kitchen not wearing masks, including a employee who coughed as he pulled a pizza from the oven. Many other employees were wearing masks, but others did not for the several minutes we waited. We spoke with an employee at the front desk about this, and asked to have our order canceled. A supervisor took over, who angrily refunded our money, and then walked off without a word. From what we saw, and the way they handled the problem, I'm not sure these people care much about the quality of the food they sell, or their customers' well being.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Totally amazing, from the crust to the sauce and i have not seen Canadian bacon in a pizza for years. Please don't be afraid to bring the family  with you. Heads up Worning: your family will be there for a while longer than you want to be. Next for me is the eggplant   Parmesan and just about every other fish they have. Good job Mike O in this what II even got time is on cheese in packages and napkins I can't remember the last time I went to a pizza place and  Parmesan in the package and also napkins amazing what a little Caesar see what you get or Papa John's or whatever!<//review>< Pics>

This was my 1st and last time eating at a Mountain Mike's. I ordered over $100"s with of food and was not impressed with any of it. Usually my family will tear up pizza but I was noticing they were throwing a almost half the slice away. I can not pin point what I didn't care for, but thinking it was a combination of the dough and sauce. As for the sides, potato skins, jalapeño poppers and boneless wings, they were below average as well.<//review>

Love this place. My mom & I ordered boneless wings today we were not given plastic utensils and were not offered or asked if we needed any. When we asked, the employee said they didn't have any. If they don't have utensils at least tell us before we order. Not everyone eats pizza. C'mon guys...what's the deal?!</Review>

We ordered a thick crust meat lovers pizza....there was so much grease in the box it leaked through the box onto my pants.  The pizza was also thin crust and overcooked. The toppings literally fell off the pizza and the pepperoni was burnt.< /review>

The pizza is pretty good. I would say the pizzas are not on the cheap side but the ingredients were fresh. They had 3 video games for the kids and a couple screens running sports. I would say this is a nice clean restaurant but didn't deliver the wow factor to bring me and the family back. The staff was great and very helpful and I appreciate that they support local sports teams.<//Text>

Their hours are totally off. Says closes at 10 p.m. I called at 830 they said they are closed.
Went down there just to confirm, it is open. It was just a bunch of teenagers just wanting to get off work early. Incredibly bad customer service but I know that the pizza is good here. No adult manager to actually take care of the store.<//review>

Beware of health and safety standards! NO ONE preparing the pizzas/food was wearing gloves or masks...touching food with their bare hands! Gross!! We walked out for our own safety after voicing our complaint to the girl behind the counter. That's totally unsanitary.< /text>

Great pizza, but not the people bringing the food to you they seem kind of lazy and they gave us the wrong pizza, the place was busy but no one was cleaning tables or stocking supplies for the tables. I was disappointed dinning in with my family I kept telling myself we should have ordered to go. The lady cashier did her best handling everything she kept apologizing but it seemed she was in a losing battle that night with the kitchen staff.< /review>

They did replenish the pizza (small pizzas) but took a long time to do so. Once it was brought out you better hurry or you'll miss the limited amount of pepperoni pizza and then have to wait a loooong time for more to come out.

Not a variety of pizzas offered at the buffet. We also had to wait on them to bring out fresh pizzas. The flavors are there though. Good tasting pizza I was just disappointed at the buffet. Salad bar was good and place is clean. The girl that worked after noon on 1/2/20 was rude and had an attitude, the guy at the register was nice. Idk if I'd go back to the buffet but I'd defenetly order pizza here again. It was good!< /text>

I have a terminal illness and don't get it much, that's why I PRAY they deliver to my place.  My hubby and nieces went out and bought me back a small mushroom and pepperoni pizza and my sister really weren't expecting much:. Then we opened the box.. PERFECT small cut pieces so I could actually eat it, toppings perfectly sitting on the darkest most beautiful red sauce.  We both took a bite and INSTANTLY feel in love!  What A GREAT PIE!  YEAH, someone finally got it right, PERFECT PIZZA!  If I could afford to reinstate Family Pizza Friday I would too bad my fixed income on SS won't let me.  I'm a real person leaving an honest review about some great pie!  Thanks Mike, we love your pizza!!!!!< /Review>< Date>

Good pizza, lunch buffet was awesome, only deducted a star because its a little pricey for pizza.  That being said if your looking for pizza that is better than the typical delivery places (pizzahut, dominos, papajohns etc...) this is where I would go.</review>

<text>Went in today at 1106 for the buffet..... let's just say it's not a buffet or it doesnt start at 11 like they advertise..... for starters the only thing besides the salad bar out at that time was some cheesticks.  The pizza that did come out after 1110 was a Half Hawaiian and half veggie.  Then the next pizza that came out was half of some meat pizza with jalapenos and half a veggie at around 1130.  Ummm what about just a plain cheese or plain pepperoni pizza.  Once those pizzas were gone we waited until after 12 and still only one other pizza a half pepperoni with half veggie again finally came out and with how many people were there we had no other pizzas to eat.  All that was left up there were the halves of veggies.  They were not putting anymore in the oven and there were no other pizzas to choose from.  We left shortly after having a disappointing lunch and definitely not a buffet.  It was literally a fight to see who could get up there fast enough to choose from the half of the pizza that had some sort of toppings other than just veggies and for those of us that like our basic pizzas we had to pull toppings off just to get anywhere close to that in order to eat something.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

My interaction with Robert from WIN Home was very professional and helpful.  He inspected a home we were considering buying.  Robert allowed me to walk through with him so that I could ask questions while he worked, which saved both of us time overall because he could show me any concerns or potential problems as he took notes.  I appreciated his unemotional candor: his observations weren't optimistic or pessimistic, they were descriptive and explanatory and informed our decision.  I would call them again for another home inspection if I were again in the market.  Thank you!<//text>

I received a phone call from Robert minutes after inquiring through the WIN website on a Friday evening. He was super nice and helpful on the phone and scheduled our home inspection for the following week. Brannon, his son, did the inspection and was also super personable and explained everything. We are first time home buyers and would recommend WIN Home Inspection 100%. You can tell they really care about their customers and enjoy what they do. Thanks for helping make our experience easy and comfortable.</Text>

<Review>Robert did a fantastic job inspecting a home before we purchased. He was on time, comprehensive and professional. At the end of the inspection he gave us a summary of his findings and answered our questions so we clearly understood everything.  The full report with pictures and more detailed write-up was emailed that evening. I can't say enough good things about Robert. We highly recommend him if you need a home inspection.<//Review>< gmapID>

Brannon was punctual, professional and presentable. He asked appropriate questions before the inspection to ensure he would know if his actions may inadvertently damage any structures on the property. I appreciated his demeanor and thoroughness. This is a great family run business and I would recommend their service. Thank you.</Text>

<Review>Robert Vierra and his son, Brandon, are always my first call when scheduling a Home Inspection on behalf of my clients for an escrow or a pre-listing inspection. They are timely, responsive, and very thorough. The turn around time to receive the report is incredibly fast, usually by end of day, if not within 12 to 24 hours.< /Review>< pics>

Robert and Brennan are the best. We use them at any opportunity we can. They are reliable, trustworthy and very thorough. We run a lot of transactions and it's very comforting to know that all of our clients are well taken care of and that we will get detailed, honest results back for every home inspection.

WIN Home Inspection provided a very detailed inspection report on our property. Robert was very thorough on his walk thru of the interior and exterior of our house and gave good recommendations on where and when repairs are needed.<//Text>

<Review>WiN Home Inspections owned by Robert Vierra has become my go to inspection agency.   I have used other companies in the past but the others just don't compare to WIN Home Inspection. Robert and Brandon are very thorough.   They are always punctual.   Robert patiently explains the details of the report in a summary upon completion, which is very helpful to my clients to understand why a home inspection is so important.  I highly recommend WIN Home Inspectors.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80921d90d72b9501:0x97032458787256d3< /gmap_id>< time>

This is a great golf course!  We had a breakfast there and then went golfing.  Our time was 9:50 but we went around 8:30.  No one on the course, we were the second group out.  The whites were a little long for me because I'm old and have lost yardage but it played really nice.  Would love to come back.< /text>

Looked like a beautiful coarse to play until we got out there. There was areas on first fairway that was piled up grass. On the tee box on 2nd hole we found out what the debris piles were, they were aeriating the fairways plus the greens were punched. They should not  sale or Golfmoose distribute coupons with the coarse in this condition. Worse experience for such a long drive< /Text>< user_id>

I celebrated my birthday last night in this great place. Well we passed a magnificent evening and the venue was surely the reason for this fruitful celebration. The stuff  helped in a splendid style, the cooking was extremely good and my guests were so  happy. We shall no dout come back again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.</Review>

<Text>I've owned a home in Graeagle Meadows for over 17 years...sadly, I just sold it! But I think I am well qualified to review Graeagle Meadows Golf Course. First - it's a very beautiful and scenic golf course. Second - it's plenty challenging for this 15-handicap...especially from the tips! Third - it's walker-friendly, which is very important to me. Fourth - the clubhouse has excellent food. I have always loved their breakfast. We've gone there for breakfast many, many times when we weren't there for the golf. It's that good. Fifth - it's reasonably priced. Not cheap, but certainly an excellent value for money. Go there, play this course and enjoy the beautiful, small American town of Graeagle while you're there. You won't be disappointed.< /Text>< Name>

Wow this course is incredible. Played on June 21st and the course was in outstanding shape considering it was just early spring in the mountains. Staff are extreamly friendly,  and accommodating.< /Text>

I surprised my wife with a date night here a few months back and we had a blast! We both agreed that it was the most hilarious dinner theater that we have ever been to. We can't wait to go back!

I have to say, I didn't expect the food to be good, so I didn't do any of the food upgrades. I was actually pleasantly surprised. Everything was pretty decent. I have the same complaints as most people, the chicken was overcooked, but everything was flavored well and the salad was fresh.

I 100% recommend upgrading your tickets to get stage side seats or VIP seating. You are more likely to be part of the show and even if you aren't, being that close to the acrobatics is totally worth the cost. If you are lucky, Rob will caress you with his unbelievably soft feminine hands.

FYI, this is more of a dinner theater with crass humor than a burlesque show, but I wouldn't have it any other way!<//review><rate>5< /rate>< time>

<gmap_id>0x80dd2be844082d75:0xeafb466f09624eb9<//gmap_id><text>I would have given 5 stars cause the show was amazing but they tell you to get there at 720 and make you stand outside for like 20 minutes and then you stand inside for like 30 minutes and theres no where to sit and my feet were killing me. The food was good. I didn't like the brownie that we had for dessert but the chicken was so good. Super moist and just perfect. Good soup too. Wanda can sing! She was amazing! And Sapphire was the best jewel for sure! She was outstanding at everything she did! You go girl!  It was fun and i would totally watch it again.< /text><time>1561211787703<//time><Rate>4<//Rate><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5VCuk62hI3ANyEwbG2noKhZ0sWNX97G3tNlyA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5w45Tp3VgmSZgpspiWUz85K3E29OIt1VeJfc4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Name>Kelly Kermode< /Name><userid>105304489400453233792< /userid><Resp>{'time': 1561566295900, 'text': 'Thank you so much for allowing us to serve you, Kelly.

<Review>It's a comedy theater show with dinner. Tomato bisque was excellent. Salad was great with a citrus vinaigrette. Chicken was overcooked. The shrimp skewer included with the entree was excellent and cooked perfectly. Chocolate cake was great. Theater performance was good, more focused on skits than physical performance. However there was one acrobatic girl hanging from the ceiling who was awesome.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ0-W_7ovo_B0Fu0jWakwYTaIzCTrWRzUmKJgi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNh5yMDkY_Rn-sS-RuePgh3ALvXAPKrwLz5CQCU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxvq7_YAW6Qnb3IyC-kIOkHam_f-VdHVO6q9Lg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1NwDDVIDDg2ShAUR0RFF75gT-olIc5j0GDZbj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

It was a fun date night 😍 Lots of singing, dancing, comedy and aerial stunts. You must be 18 to attend. They served appetizers before you were seated. Full bar 🍹🍸🍷 Then soup, salad, dinner and dessert. Surprisingly, the food was decent. We used a Groupon and it saved us $55 for 2 tickets. #LOCALGUIDES #TEATROMARTINI< /text>

I wanted to do something special for my friends 60th birthday, and Teatro Martini was a fantastic way to celebrate her birthday. This show was so entertaining. It had comedy, music, magic and amazing talent! Also the food was so delicious! As we  waited to be seated before the show, there were appetizers in a waiting area. After being seated, we were served by the fabulous Cabaret Servers, (named the Jewels) tomato bisque soup, salad, chicken and shrimp, and chocolate cake for desert. We all thoroughly enjoyed this show. Thank you to the entire cast and chefs for making this a fantastic evening! Oh...I forgot to mention, they have free parking!</text>

<Review>The show was great and the team is very talented! We really enjoyed ourselves! It was hilarious and the singing and dancing was on point. I would have given 5 stars except there were quite a few times where we had a hard time hearing/understanding what was being said. My husband is also pretty bummed... he bought the package with champagne, a rose, a photo and our names were supposed to be called out. He did it as a surprise for our anniversary...unfortunately he had to ask for each item individually, they never mentioned our names, and the rose is a very cheap looking fabric rose. He felt like the surprise was ruined. I do recommend the show, but I don’t recommend waisting money on upgrades.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1591207127741, 'text': 'Thanks!

Always a wonderful time. We had our company party of 160 employees here for the third time and everyone had a great time again. The show is high energy, witty and hilarious. A word of caution: if you're overly sensitive to crude humor, I'd suggest you do the Pirate's Dinner Adventure instead.<//Review>

It sounded like just what we wanted. It is a wonderful show. Styled as a vintage Vaudeville show. A little bawdy no nudity just "song, dance, and patter" as my grandma used to say describing Vaudeville. You must go for sure, dinner included which was fine. Pay for the VIP seating. Worth the money. Just dress up and have a blast!!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1560529289919, 'text': 'Thanks! We appreciate the review and hope to see you soon!'}<//resp>< gmapID>

We went this Sunday and had a great time. The check-in was easy and simple, and they had plenty of parking (awesome!)

Even before we went into the show room, the entertainers were already talking with the audience, making jokes.

We went in and quickly were served a delicious tomato bisque. Then salad, then chicken (very good, btw!)

Then the show started and we were laughing the whole time.

I highly recommend it!<//Text>< Pictures>

Simply Amazing !!! A show worth seeing. Everything was Great. Staff super friendly,  Drinks was great had one Sapphire drink and Teatro Martini Specialty. The food was good but recieved dish warm, not saying it wasn't delicious because it was. But the show blew it out of the water, funny from start to finish. They will definitely be seeing me there again loved it.  Long story short , if your looking for none stop laughter good food and drinks, This Is The Place.<//Text>

I guess the term  "most outstanding live entertainment" as indicated on their website, is a huge overstatement if you have really experienced quality entertainment. The quality of the show was very lacking. The cast was so so. The costumes were cheap. Only good part was the silk ropes aerealist.
The 4 course meal consisted of a barely warm tomato soup, a house salad,mushy vegetables, overseasoned butterflied chicken and soggy shrimp. For dessert, a brownie like any. All frozen microwaved food.
Cramped lobby where people stand in line for whatever those fritters with ranch sauce were. Expensive drinks full of fillers.
The fact that when I called their customer service number, I got an automated recording from Pirates Adventure, should have been the give away. If Medieval Times is your idea of "outstanding live entertainment", then you won't be disappointed. Otherwise, use your money for a nice meal anywhere else. Even the Outback steakhouse across the street would be a better option.< /text>

The service took their time. The food was good. I just wish it was warmer instead of basically cold. Starter: salad. Dinner: chicken breast, baby carrots, mash potatoes, and shrimp.

From the dancing to the comedy the staff does not let up, and not a single one of them lacks talent. The food was very good quality and did not lack flavor. The comedy is definitely targeted toward a crasser crowd, and I wouldn't suggest anyone see it who is easily offended. That said if you leave a few personal gripes aside you can definitely still have fun.<//Review><Rate>5< /Rate><user_id>109032767369779485977<//user_id><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

The place has a very old timey ambience to it. Before the show started they were playing old silent films. Our assigned waitress was very nice and attentive, and she made sure to bring our food and drinks out in a timely manner. The humor was adult but funny and I loved seeing all the different acts. Overall, I had a great time!< /review>

Show was great. Giving this 3 stars because one of the jewels knocked over my girlfriends drink and spilled it on her and didn't even apologize for doing so. Got soda all over her, inside her purse, her phone, and the pictures I spent $42 got wet. Would really like to get new pictures and see if there is anything they can do about my girlfriends phone in case it has water damage.</text>

This place was amazing all the way around. The hosts were very attentive and courteous, the food was delicious at the atmosphere was brilliant. The shows were hilariously funny. Not one dull moment. Saphire and the rest of the girls were fantastic, Saphire being the prettiest. I definately recommend this place for any occasion.😂👍< /Review>

< Review>
Highly recommend! Grown up fun! Leave the kids (anyone under 18 give or take a year or two) with the babysitter/at home. Audience participation. Great cocktails, yummy food, & fantastic service!
At the end of the night my cheeks hurt from smiling/laughing so much.
There's no cursing but if you're easily offended this may not be the place for you. Check out a few videos to get an idea, buy tickets on Groupon, & show up approximately 30+ minutes early. First come first seated. Relatively small place so just about any seat will be a good one. The best seats have a clear view of the main stage which will be to your left when you walk in.<//Review>

<review>Gawd that was awful. Seriously, don't bother.
Appetizers were unappetizing.
Meal upgrades to salmon and steak were bad. Can't imagine what the regular meal was like.
Drinks were expensive and tasted like cough syrups.
Entertainment was raunchy and not very musical. Their highlight was the balloon man who came out a couple of times.

I didn't care for it much. Most of the people in my group also were not impressed. I had a few drinks, and didn't mind it getting roudy- but the show lacked real comedy and tried to get off on dumb sexual jokes. I would have loved more theatrical talent. The best part was the aerial girl (actual talent)</Review>

Teatro Martini is a fun interactive vaudeville style variety show at the Pirates Dinner Theater location. It is definitely adult only and a little racy, but a lot of fun for a night out. As they say, "If you are easily offended, this is probably not the show for you."  I have been a couple times now. The cast and acts change out, so its not the exact same show every time.
The dinner on Saturday night is good. The Thursday, Friday, Sunday shows are better for drinks and appetizers, but they do have a full menu available if you want. Get there early, on Saturday they have appetizers and always have a full bar available before the show.
Check your favorite deal site for tickets, and tip your waitress as she may be singing and dancing as well.</review>

Food was ok, nothing spectacular, below average for a restaurant. Appetizers were non-existent. The show was not that good.  There was a lot of corny jokes, a couple magic tricks that were pretty lame, a couple girl dancing performances that were ok.  Good crowd interaction.  It was somewhat entertaining, but I don't see myself going back or recommending it to others.</text>

We went to this show a couple of years ago and it was 5 star the food was really good the show was excellent our seats were terrific, this time it had hors d overs were not good I think they were all from Costco the food if you wanted a choice of entrees you had to pay extra otherwise you got chicken the show was mediocre the best part was Chip the magician there were a few other goid acts but thetwoman emcee was much better the 1st time we went and no cheesecake it was regular white cake our server was really good and nice probably won't go back for a 3rd time if it's your first time you won't know the difference and will probably like it< /Text>

My advice to you can be stated in two words: arrive early.

I found a Groupon that had decent prices for these tickets and thought it'd be a fun thing to get dressed up for and take my husband to for his birthday. I called ahead to reserve a table and got us the "Night to Remember" upgrade.

They tell you that the doors open at 7:15 and that you should arrive early to check-in. We arrived at 7:00, and found the parking lot totally full. Teatro Martini shares the lot with the Pirates Adventure show. The Pirates show starts first, so all the spaces were taken up by patrons of that show, many of them parked rather badly, so 1/3 of the spaces in the lot, were actually open spots that people parked over the line on.

We had dressed to the nines, because the site said "semi-formal" dress code. I argued with my husband because he wanted to wear a nice pair of converse and I forced him to wear dress shoes. When we arrived, we saw a lot of casual dress and a lot of sneakers. So now I owe my husband one...

When we got in, we took a cute photo and I decided to upgrade our meals again to include the lobster tail. The lovely woman in the gift shop told me to keep my receipt and give it to my server. We got some drinks and Teatro Martini actually provided a small happy hour with some snacks before the show.

We were seated in the back left corner, right by the entrance and literally in front of the manager's table. Our server was Lauren, she was a peach, a lovely lady who tried her very best. But unfortunately, they gave her way too many tables. She was running around her gigantic section and our table didn't get any water until after our first course arrived. I gave Lauren my receipt for the lobster tail upgrade, but she either erroneously put the order in, or the cooks forgot. Because the birthday boy didn't get a lobster tail. When his lobster FINALLY came out, he couldn't eat it because Madame Gretta had come over to say happy birthday to him, as per the "Night to Remember" package I purchased. They offered us two drinks for the lobster tail mistake.

At the end of the show, we left immediately and tried to grab our pictures, but the guy who was standing there got hostile when I asked him for our photo. He kept saying, "It's $20 for the photo." as I was pointing to our printed shot. I said, "But we have the Night to Remember package?" he either ignored me, or didn't hear me, as he was chatting with his colleague. I repeated myself, loudly, and he shoved the photo into my hands without apology.

The service and the way we were treated, given the price tag of it all, is why I'm giving them only 2 stars. I literally sat IN FRONT of the management and they couldn't be half-assed to even look at us or notice that we didn't have any water.

The only saving grace, is that the performance was decent, our server Lauren was incredibly sweet, and the food was actually really good.< /Text>

Teatro Martini is not what I would call a cabaret style show, it’s a simple and uninspiring sophomoric variety show. How the “Teatro” name is associated with this show is beyond me. . . . .
Having twice experienced Teatro Zinzani in 2012, I assumed Teatro Martini would be just as entertaining and delightful and I wanted to love it. Wrong. . . . For starters, the room setup isn't conducive for the size of the crowd, meaning not every seat provides full view of the entire show. We were in group B (out of A, B, C) and were sat on the far end of a table on the extreme right side of the stage. Needless to say we missed out on a number of things because our view was limited. Having the knowledge that the website states that they will make seating adjustments upon request, this is not the case as I did request better seats only to be told that our seats were fine and that we could see the entire show from our locale. Group C had much better seats than those in Group B who sat at my table. When making the reservations I was told seating would be on a first come first served basis and the earlier the arrival the better the seats. Not the case.
The food quality doesn't compare with that of Teatro Zinzani. We had the chicken and salmon. The house served dinner with the first dish brought out being the brisket followed by the chicken. After receiving our chicken dish we waited a good 20 minutes before our salmon was served, and when it arrived it smelled like it had laid up on the bank of a river in the sun before making its way on to our table. The taste matched the stench. While the chicken wasn't great, it was at least edible.
Save your money and put it towards something of value, as Teatro Martini is so incredibly overpriced in comparison to the level and quality of food and entertainment.</text>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>Took my parents and 5 others (party of 8) as part of my mother's birthday celebrations (she turned 87)!  Both of my parents really enjoyed the food, just don't expect a gourmet meal and you won't be disappointed.  The party sampled each of the dinner selections (beef brisked, roasted chicken and salmon) as well as the lobster tail upgrades with a glass of champagne...All acceptable although could have been a bit warmer when served.

Make sure that you arrive early and order drinks from the bar as soon as you enter...if not the line/wait can get a bit long and you might miss out on the appetizers.  All of the appetizers were very tasty.

As other reviewers have mentioned, take the photo when you arrive...you aren't obligated to purchase any copies.  We did and weren't disappointed with the results (we purchased the souvenir copy for $20).

I should mention that we had just returned from our birthday celebration trip to Las Vegas where we saw a CIrque cabaret show "Zumanity" and had two very expensive dinners (chef's table at Gallagher's Steakhouse and at Mastro's Ocean Club) so we are no strangers to fine dining and Cabaret / Live theater.

The show at Teatro Martini was just as entertaining (if you don't expect a XXX rated show) and the food was acceptable at a FRACTION of the price!  My parents enjoyed the show more than the Cirque show and the entertainment (and view) was just as good as our most expensive seats at the Las Vegas theater!

The aerial performer was outstanding (a former Cirque artist; very beautiful as well) and the magician was very entertaining and amazing, especially when you consider both his repartee  and his singing voice!  One in our party is a magician and he enjoyed the act without reservation!

The hostess / MC / diva was excellent as were all of the performers / ensemble!

Our server "Taylor" was both efficient and beautiful!

Don't forget to tip on the full value of your dinner...the performers and your server work very hard to entertain you and they do an outstanding job!< /text>< date>

<Review>Come wizz mee, to zee Teatro Martini

$30 off promo

Boob jokes, penis jokes, vagina jokes your thing?  Then, you're at the right place!  Teatro Martini is a dinner cabaret with a variety of acts & a full course meal (choice of certified Angus braised beef brisket, .chicken leg quarter or center cut salmon filet).  I'm assuming there are accommodations for vegetarians, but nothing specific on the menu or on the website.  The show's kinda bawdy, kinda raunchy, sophomoric if you will - all in good fun & nothing explicit.  Just not family-friendly entertainment.  I arrived in my purple long sleeve collar shirt (more on this later) ready for whatever the night brings.

Teatro Martini is conducted in the same building as Pirate's Dinner Adventure.  The ticket windows have 1 line for each respectively.  Inside, guests are led to the area around the bar & the Pirate's gift shop.  Have your pic professionally taken & buy it later for the reasonable price of $15.

Tray passed appetizers made the rounds, of which I helped empty.

Tonight's dinner-

Tomato bisque
Salad
Certified Angus braised beef brisket-
A generous cut, the brisket was the most tender pot roast I've had.  The best part being the juicy fat, it was laid on a bed of mashed potatoes w/ carrots.

Cheesecake-
The menu said tiramisu, but we were greeted with slices of rich cheesecake.  I suppose tiramisu season is over at the the moment ;p  Regardless, the slice of cheesecake was creamy & a satisfying end to a meal.

The show was a hodgepodge of singing, awe-inspiring acrobatics, comedy, magic, quick change artists and musical revues, interspersed with servings of the night's meals.  I became part of the act on not 1, but 2 occasions.  Wanda picked me out of the audience for the "Rio" segment, saying she liked purple. I then began to shimmy like a maniac, doing a mighty fine job if you ask me, with her and the "Jewels".   Also, I took part in the musical finale, where I once again shook what my mama gave me to hit dance songs from throughout the years.  I was jokingly telling fellow guests that I'm actually an employee at Teatro Martini, and it was all part of the act ;p

Seating is in half circles from the stage for Sections A-C, with booths towards the back.  Within each section is your assigned table, but it's first come, first serve as to which seat you'd like to sit at.

Service was good.  The fair women were quick with bringing out food, drinks and what not.  Parking is in a private lot, shared with Pirate's Dinner Adventure.  Free self parking, and valet is $6.  The self parking is ridiculously close & valet is ludicrously unnecessary.

Personally, I would NOT pay for full price, but like Medieval Times & Teatro Martini's sister show, Pirate's, special promotions are available on a regular basis.

I had a blast! A great time, indeed.  Most assuredly, it's not for everyone, but if you can be open-minded and enjoy some perverted humor, permeated with great singing, dancing, comedy and other entertainment, then I think you're in for a real treat.  Granted, I managed to be part of the extravaganza a couple times, which factored into my enjoyment  level, but I nonetheless enjoyed a fun evening of dinner & an amusing show.

Highly recommend!<//Review><Name>Rodney S< /Name>< Resp>

<Review>San Mateo Sports Nutrition is by far the best shop. They are super helpful and friendly. They always make sure you walk out of there knowing what you have bought is what you need. Great staff. Great ownership. Great supps. Just by far the best place I’ve ever been when I need things.
Appreciate you guys,< /Review>< Pictures>

Jason and Tri are amazing! I have been going to them for years and the care and attention they provide to each customer is what keeps bringing me back. They are very knowledgeable about their products and will definitely help you find what works best for you and your body.

Speaking of their products - The supplements sold here are all top of the line. Depending on what my nutrition and training goals are at any given time, there is always a supplement available to help me achieve my goals.

I guarantee that once you start shopping here, you will no longer need to shop anywhere else for your supplement needs!</review>

< Review>
Love coming here! The staff, Jason and Tree, are very Knowledgeable w their products, very friendly and always welcoming. I’ve followed their IG account for years since I was still living in Cleveland, and now i actually get to come show my support in person. They are also very generous with giving their customers free sample of their products which is very helpful when looking into new supplements. Hands down love coming here for the good positive vibes! Highly recommend!</Review>

J and the team treat you like their family. Big diversity of high quality products. If you don't know what you're looking for they will ask you the right questions and suggest you the best products for your case. I don't shop for supplements anywhere else. Plus you can buy online and get it shipped to your doorstep, great during pandemic!! Keep up the good work guys!!!</text>

<Time>1601337956205< /Time><rating>5< /rating><Text>Can't express how great the whole team is at San Mateo Sports Nutrition. Everyone is friendly, supportive and extremely knowledgeable about fitness, dieting and their products and services. I've been a regular at San Mateo Sports Nutrition and the guys are an awesome bunch to talk to about fitness and anything else. On top of that, they regularly let you try samples of new products so that you can test them out for yourself before you come back to buy. Jason and the whole team are awesome! Definitely worth coming here whether you're a beginner or advanced fitness enthusiast.< /Text>< pics>

This place has superior customer service! I’ve been frequenting San Mateo Sports Nutrition & Supplements since their early days. Everyone is professional, friendly, and very knowledgeable. Most times, I’ve work with Jason, one of the owners. I appreciate him taking the time to explain how supplements work within our bodies. Jason will give recommendations for what my husband and I will need. You will not be oversold! The guys at San Mateo Sports Nutrition & Supplements will also be your biggest supporters in whatever fitness path or journey you take. I always appreciate the encouragement to continue with mine!<//Review>

<Text>Jason is a humble, friendly, and VERY funny shop owner who knows his products and how to best fit your needs. Jason also knows his stuff when it comes to competition prep so don’t hesitate to ask his opinions on supplements. He carries top brands in the industry and especially my all time favorite SuperBioFreakOMG by Globalformulas. I’ll see you soon Jason! Stay Hilarious!!!<//Text><rate>5</rate>< Response>

I’ve been going here since they were still known as “Max Muscle”. It’s the same staff and owner. Jason, Tri, and Nico have been nothing but informative and helpful. They don’t try to sell you on anything when you’re in the store. They will answer any question you may have and let you decide if that product is best for you. They also ship if you order online or by phone. But if you’re local, I highly suggest you stop by the store and meet the staff. They are all super cool to talk to, especially Jason! You might end up in his IG story too 😅</Review>

This place is awesome - Jason and Tri their know their stuff and will spend as much time with you as you need to answer your questions, whether it's about a particular product or whether it's about a goal you have and the best way for you to get there. Also, they have plenty of samples available - if you're not sure about a product or flavor, odds are they'll have samples available that you can take home and try before you buy. Once you start shopping here  you won't want to go anywhere else. I've been coming here for 10 years, buying supplements and seeking advice, and they've always gone over the top to answer my questions and to help me out.< /Text>

I have been coming to San Mateo sports nutrition for years now. I stock up on supplements every month or two. I get protein powders, aminos and daily vitamins.This store has everything you need. What I love the most about this store  is how knowledgeable and educated Jason and his employees are.He understands what’s happening on a cellular level when taking supplements or how your body is responding to certain supplements. I also work with coach Nico Abaya for bikini/lifestyle!!! If your in San Mateo stop by!</review>

<review>By far the best nutrition store I've ever been too. This place has TOP NOTCH suppliments and isn't saturated with heavily marketed low quality suppliments like most nutrition places. You'll also find knowledgeable people who not only know their products but also care about health, fitness, body building etc. Highly recommend checking this place whether you're new into the fitness world or you're a competitior< /review>< userid>

Such a gem! If you are in town, stop by and see Jason! Not only is he a super scientist when it comes to nutrition, but he has the biggest heart and smile to match.  Everyone of his customers becomes a friend.  He is happy to hand out samples and may even introduce you to a new supplement or addition to your routine! Plenty of street parking.

SMSN has been my to go shop for all my supplements for 10+ years. They have a wide variety of Pre and post workout supplements, protein, fat burners, healthy candies , cookies , energy drinks , you name it. The best is that they don’t push any supplements to your throat hehe for you to buy it , they give you samples to try first.  Great location, clean store and friendly staff. I totally recommend this shop it’s the Sephora of supplements in San Mateo LOL .</text>

< review>
I started coming here about 5 months ago, but in the past I’ve always stuck to Costco and GNC for my supplements. I decided to switch over to San Mateo Sports Nutrition because of J and Tri. They don’t only have awesome products, but they also take the time to get to know the people that step foot in the store. I felt welcomed the day I stepped in there. Learned a lot about different supplements while having a real conversation with them! I would highly recommend checking them out, and not to mention get a lot of samples! Thanks for being real in the game J & Tri!</review>

< review>
Have been following San Mateo Sports Nutrition for a couple years now and have to say Jason’s knowledgeable humor and stories on IG really caught my attention.. I currently live in Solano County and well decided to take the drive to visit the store in person and must sat I was not disappointed..Jason is very kind and knowledgeable.. Definitely a genuine one of a kind guy..Ultimate customer service.
Love all the products and never disappoints with the supplements he recommends to achieve my goals weather just to be healthy or have weight loss goals or overall wellness  💪🏼 The drive is definitely worth it and will recommend to anyone looking for those ultimate goals and in need of understanding a product or supplement they may be in doubt of.. 10/10</review>

I called ahead to get a inBody evaluation. Jason answered and he was so helpful and friendly. Upon entering the store, I was met with the same enthusiasm!

I will make the hike from Santa Cruz just to experience the fun and upbeat atmosphere.</Text>

<username>Jessica Egoyibo Mong< /username><review>Ok, this is one brick and mortar store that I don't taking the time to walk into.

I've always bought my supplements online. My coach (Coach Drew of CrossFit Burlingame) recommended a few items and this store. Decided to take a walk there, instead of ordering online and I'm happy I did.

Jason was very attentive, walking me through all the benefits of the items I was purchasing. He gave me details about how to use them also. I'll definitely be heading here for my supplements purchases from now on.</review><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<review>So, initially I found about this place through Instagram because of their weekly giveaway contests. Week after week I played and finally won! When I went in, the owner was helping out a family but made sure to welcome me as soon as I came in. I work for 24 Hour Fitness and am around supplements all the time, but I am always wanting to learn more about supplements. I walked in and was able to choose between liquid l-carnitine or cleanse & lean. I chose the l-carnitine, but he opened a bottle of cleanse & lean and still gave me a sample so I could see what that product was all about as well. No pressure at ALL for sales; the owner truly carries out that "there to teach/serve you" customer service style. You walk into a place like GNC and they may offer SOME knowledge but nowhere near to the extent of MAX Muscle and nowhere near as relaxed. The orange zest l-carnitine is delicious and I am definitely returning to get more once this bottle runs out (perfect flavor, not sweet, good concentration, good energy, already-seen results/felt effect). Truly a place of supply, quality, and knowledge... not supply, sales pitch, and pressure.</review>< pictures>

<time>1617980590666</time><rate>5</rate><Text>To me, this little course is a great value for the So Cal area. Its not very long (just under a 1k yds), but its tricky enough to be worthwhile. There is some decent elevation changes for a course so short. The greens are TINY so accuracy is key. The greens surface is okay, its not a great type of grass for greens. But they probably run fine when not punched and divots repaired (greens seemed to be punched a few weeks ago). It does not have a driving range but it does have a putting green. It also has a small clubhouse that offers refreshments. The only drawback is that you are hitting off of mats at each tee box. But, I guess that's the greens fee trade off. Its nestled in the southwest corner of Ford park. Its bordered by the soccer/baseball fields (currently under construction), the river bed, and a nursery. So it was super quiet during my round. I didn't play very well and was able to finish in under an hour. Although, that was likely more related to my start time. By the time I finished, multiple groups had shown up. So starting at that time would have resulted in at least 1.75 hr round. Awesome little value and great practice opportunity!</Text>< pics>

I just had my baby 6 months ago and we’ve even brought my son along with us in the stroller for a nice walk a few times! However, we tried to bring our son like usual and they tried charging us for my son. He’s 6 months old, and they expected us to pay for him to golf? Ridiculous. Neither us nor our family will be back. Such a shame. Don knabe is a great alternative & they don’t make us pay for my son. I highly suggest going there instead!<//text>< Pictures>

With all the open holes to do your best to go balls deep from 400 yards away, why go anywhere else? With such a relaxed atmosphere even the most stubborn fool and make some magic happen. Pregame with some enhancement pills to amp up your game and head to these holes that are happily waiting to be filled!< /Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<resp>None<//resp><text>Course in decent shape, but not worth the green fees. If you manage to get in the “bunkers”  good luck with a clean shot, they feel terrible. Greens are in better conditions with some imperfections. The management is sub-par and lacks customer service. Course Marshal fails to enforce course rules creating poor golf etiquette among players.</text>< Gmap_id>

Nice par 3.  Small greens require accuracy.   No sand or water hazards but steep greens require your best putting. Hitting off mats do not take away from the charm of this hidden gem on the Southeast side. Enjoy!!!</Text>

(Translated by Google) It is a large park, the footbool is practiced a lot and to breathe fresh air and exercise outdoors and cycling is ideal.You can also go to piner in practice your fisherman's gifts with fishing rods.asiste and relax.Tambien al lado This is the adult school for anyone who wants to excel intellectually.

Clean store. Most of the staff are polite and helpful. But some of the clerks need to remember they're at work, not at the club being snotty to people they don't like. Unfortunately the parking lot has a lot of vagrants and no security officials. And that doesn't change, ever.<//text>

<text>When the lines get long I see too many associates joking around talking to each there instead of checking customers out for faster service!  This needs to be addressed! I shop here way too often because of the selection even for a smaller Marshall's.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Great store!!  Lots of items and actually, the store is very clean and straight for a bargain store!!  I went in to get a new purse, they had an okay selection of purses and they had some amazing Michael Kors purses that I would have loved to have but even at a bargain was a little too much for me, maybe next month!!  But they had a large selection of winter wear on clearance and really good clearance prices!!  They even have a large selection of makeup, cellphone accessories (mainly iPhone) and beauty supplies!!  Got a 4 pack of OPI small bottles of nail polish for dirt cheap!!  My next paycheck, I know where I'm going shopping at!!</Review>< name>

Went window shopping at Marshall's tonight. Was looking for a shirt for my son's homecoming. They have a lot of clothes from brand new entrance the 4XL, but nothing for a high school young man that had any style to it.
I took a stroll on all aisle to the store and found many exciting and wonderful things. Did you know that they have purses, pots and pans, shoes, sleepwear, lots of different kinds of electronics, children's toys and so much more.
When I go here again? Yes I would. It's a lot of things to see and they a lot of items on clearance right now. Up to 70% off the sign says

My boyfriend picked up a can of body spray and they kicked him out of Marshall's for entirety of his life all he did was pick up a bottle and it looked like he was going to attempt to spray himself thought he wasn't. I always shopped at this Marshalls and till they got so weird. We're a good looking couple when we weren't going to spray on our own for god sake they made a big deal and now he can ever go shopping there again. What a nightmare of a store and an experience! Stay away from this Marshalls everyone!</Review>

<Review>If i can give a 0 I would. Please if your taking the time to read this do not shop here. The staff is Very RUDE. And they  all speak to each other about the shoppers. All ladies are rude including cashiers. Place is disorganized and you will always have some behing you asking if your not gonna buy not to touch. A guy got kicked out for having his headphones loud!

Expect them to treat you like a thief. I read the reviews before going in there. The reviews on here are true man, they literally watch you. Alllllllllllllll throughout your trip. But its cool, still got what i wanted and left. Simple.</Review>

<review>Needs a lot of cleaning and organizing,  items are in a random places... It seems so crowded and cluttered.  After trying to get the last package from the back of  those hanging racks near the registers area ( cosmetics, electronics,  seasonal items and such) I gave up, every time I was getting the package off those hooks, the whole row would fall down so I decided to leave and  look somewhere else for the stuff I was planning to purchase in this location...<//review><Response>None<//Response><user_id>111620029397305840541</user_id>< Gmap_id>

Clean store, surprised at how well organized it was compared to other stores. Not much to choose from in electronics compared to other locations.< /text>

So I just went today morning with my wife and family. Had a bad experience with one of the employees. She kept following us and made us feel so uncomfortable. We bought a lot of items, I assume she thought we weren't going to buy them but she was making it so obvious by ending up at the register too by pretending to fold clothes. So annoyed and will definitely not be shopping there with my family again. And yes we ended up buying everything in our shopping cart lady. We were not planning on stealing a anything< /text>

I had the worst experience at this store. I've never had a bad trip to Marshall's before until today. I went in with the intention of buying a couple of booties and some hair products and maybe  a winter jacket. I came in and shipped around for a bit but was carrying to many things so I went to ask for a basket or something. Then an ass ociate very rudely asked if I would mind leaving my bag up front, I was carrying a small back pack big enough to fit my wallet, umbrella and a water bottle, I said I did mind because I had just seen a few customers with backpacks no bigger than mine. Two of the associates ganged up on me and told me I could not shop around with a backpack on. I pointed out that she had just rung up a coupleof women with backpacks and she just rolled her eyes. I left everything with her and just purchased one pair of booties. I had been in that store before and had never had a problem with my backpack, it was rude and honestly unacceptable to be treated like that in a store that I frequently visit. Sadly after this experience I don't know if I'll be returning.</Text>

This place is very organized however the choices seems to alway point to RBX brands. Why do I always see this brand here? I thought all rejected department store clothes wind up here. I have never seen RBX brand anywhere but here. Their quality is horrible. Other than going clothes by clothes on the racks avoiding nothing but RBX clothing I found nothing interesting actually.</text>

(Translated by Google) the store is clean and organized, but the customer service its horrible, they (the employees) lack of CS, also they act like they hate their job and they treat people a way they make you feel you're not welcome to the store, employees should be greatfull to have a job in this darks times.

la tienda está limpia y organizada, pero el servicio al cliente es horrible, actúan como si odiaran su trabajo y tratan a las personas de una manera que te hacen sentir que no eres bienvenido a la tienda, los empleados deberian estar agradecidos de tener un trabajo en estos tiempos oscuros.</Review>
