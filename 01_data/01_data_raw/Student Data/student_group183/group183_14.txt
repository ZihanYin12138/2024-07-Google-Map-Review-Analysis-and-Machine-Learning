<time>1619486352406</time><Resp>None</Resp><Review>I'm a USMC Vet who signed up for their 7 day promotion on a Friday. I text their office about coming over on a Saturday to start. I immediately received a text from their manager to wait and come in when staff is available, which is M-F during normal working hours.

So, ok, I arrived on Monday about Noonish, the manager was on break so one of the receptionist assisted me but not before telling me that I needed to wear a mask because this Anytime Fitness is connected to a physical therapy center with some elderly people, regular folks and ppl being "worked on" at the massage tables, themselves wearing their masks.
She said something about, if other people see me Not wearing a mask it may cause some kind of a potential hazard to the others? (I'm thinking,,, What hazard, what risks?🙄)
She took my temperature, I said that I'm healthy and that if sick people who are scared of getting Covid-19 shouldn't be out anyways for their own protection, right? And that I have a medical condition, which requires me to breath in fresh air,,, especially if I'm working out or gonna be exerting myself, duh (common sense). It's imperative that our body, mind and overall complete system get enough air fresh to be naturally rejuvenated and heal for soul-mind-body wellness.

The receptionist was cool about it and seem to understand the logic, wanting to remedy this situation, she suggested that I come back after hours when the physical therapy center was close but the gym remains open? I couldn't do that, telling her that I was instructed to come check in during working hours being that it was my first day and that I was given instructions to come between those hours. (Plus, I was already there,, why the inconvenience of coming back later on at night, wasting more fuel, time and causing unnecessary trouble.)🙄

As I was putting on my mask in the waiting room she kindly allowed me to go work out until the Anytime Fitness manager was back from break in order to check me in officially. After about 45 minutes of stretching, leg presses, lower back workouts a shorter, round woman comes out to inform me that I was granted only this 1 visit and Not the 7 day promotion like other people were getting (which was their advertisement & promotion). She informed me that it was her that texted me to let me know to come in during normal working hours BUT she didn't informed by text that it was only a 1 time visit. 🙄😴

It's a 25 mile rd trip for me with congested traffick, it took me 45 minutes just to drive there and back home (60 & 91 FW 🙄). She could have saved me the time, the trouble by letting me know of the 1 day & not the 7 days. For me, I wouldn't make this drive or the hassle involved if it was for 1, 45 minute workout.

I think it's their hidden prejudice and fears.
My physical appearance could have intimated or triggered them? (I'm not an old white woman needing their therapy session. I'm there to exercise and maintain fitness.)
I was wearing a mask during my workouts but it would slide below my nose periodically when I needed to breath after each set and not suffocate or causing harm🙄. I workout away from others, wiped down equipments, had my ear buds on, doing my own thing without interference.
The manager didn't explain a whole lot and seemed to just want me out of there asap.

I think they came together with the manager & made a judgement call. I think they came to their own conclusions and made their call without really hearing me out and understanding the real facts about Covid. (Is it 1, 2 or 3 masks, 6 feet apart and with Vaccinations? And, what are you scared of? Aren't you immune after your Vaxxs?)🙄

I had to cut my workout short after one of their male therapist (a short, semi bald slightly overweight fellow comes over to me,,, inches away from my face and Not 6 feet away as is their policy,,, to tell me to put my mask back up. I ignored him, finished my last set, grab my things.

By this time, it was already getting too much. Getting cold & angry looks from their employees & therapists under their masks 😷. I left.< /Review></record>

I love working out at this gym! It's in the process of a complete remodel and I can't wait to see the end result! They have all the equipment to get you where you want to be and group training classes for their members which is exactly what I need! Big shout out to Noel for signing me up!</review>

This location does not meet the normally high standards of Anytime Fitness. There are massage tables and physical therapy stuff set up along the perimeter of the small facility. It feels very uncomfortable when you walk in. One of the strangest experiences of my life. Was expecting a gym not a bunch of b.s.</text>< pictures>

If this were my only experience with Anytime Fitness, I’d run from the name as long as I heard it. This particular joint shares the floor with a Rehab clinic, which isn’t necessarily the issue...it’s just a crowded floor with limited equipment as a result. It’s here and available for me to use in my area today, so I can’t complain too much.< /Text>

Walked in seen how gross it was turned around and left.  Said something about it to meat head at front desk and he just stared at me lost, but as I was leaving he decided to come outside and want to confront us.  FYI we have used anytime fitness for 4 years across the country with very little issues but this one tops the cake.  If you own this check out your bad review on our YouTube channel.<//review>

After visiting many franchises Nationwide , this "gym" appears to be a side gig thrown into the middle of a a physical therapy/ massage clinic. You enter and then are literally walking past offices and desks for the clinic, staff all over .Even massage tables in near walls inside gym. Terrible ,ill equipped, poorly maintained equipment , that is not nearly up to standards for anytime. Showers / restrooms are in an odd spot and an insult , as is the whole set up of the place. You want to workout in the middle of a circus , and phys therapy clinic with fat ladies getting massages next to you? Well have fun then! Me ,never again!</Text>

<Text>The worst anytime fitness I have ever been to. The gym is missing a lot of essential equipment but most important is where are the damn weights? I struggle finding 45lb plates although the gym is tiny. Tens are missing. Fives are extinct. Not recommended.<//Text><Name>Redha Sulail< /Name>< GmapID>

< review>
I made a yelp account just for this review.
Story time:
A year ago I went to a previous mechanic in Escondido who charged $300 for a fuel pump. Few months later, went to RMW for a transmission sensor, they charged $600. Was handled quickly, didn't second-guess it. 1 week ago, my ride overheats and shuts down. Ramona Motor Works tells me I have leaks in my coolant and my radiator, quotes me at $1100. Still clueless at this time, I say ok. They call back next day to tell me they "ran a second test, and it did not pass that test" (no specifics). But I was told my head gasket was blown and it would cost up to an additional $4k. Thought this was sketchy and researched my previous repairs. A fuel pump with parts and labor runs between $250 and $1000, meaning the first mechanic in Escondido was honest. Can't say the same about RMW. A transmission sensor goes for $10 to $100, with $80 to $100 for labor... $200 tops. Even with an additional $100 added, they still charged double what they should have. Drove my overheated van to Escondido to the previous mechanic, he plugged leaks in the in the coolant hose/tank, no more overheating. Radiator was fine, no issues found with head gasket. Took him 3 hours (including letting the van run for 2 hours for tests). These people at Ramona Motor Works overcharge and price gouge during a pandemic and prey on those not savvy on vehicles. I see them as a chop shop now and will not be returning. I do not trust anything about this business down to the reviews on their Google page. If your vehicle breaks down and you want to save money, pay to tow it to an honest mechanic in Escondido (I recommend On Schedule). If you have deep pockets and don't care about money, they'll be happy to help in a timely fashion... 1 star.< /review>

<review>My husband and I have been taking our vehicles to Ramona Motor Works since we moved to Ramona over 20 years ago.  Without exception, each service, no matter what was wrong with the vehicles, was done perfectly.  In addition to a 'current' model, we have a 30 years old truck, plus a 27 year old truck with standard transmission, and despite the age of the vehicles,  the mechanics at Ramona Motor Works always manage to repair the vehicles, no matter what the problem.  Occasionally, Sal will   even drive the vehicle back to our house for us.  Great, prompt and accurate service every time.<//review>< Pics>

Ramona Motor Works fixed my A/C and put new tires on my car. My A/C works better then it ever has and my tires are great! I won’t take my car any where else. The first time I came in here my car worked better than it did when I first got it!<//Text>

<Review>Super friendly, upstanding people. I do my own work and came here for a smog. My Water Pump exploded at the smog station, and they didnt try to give me quotes on repairs (i made it known i do my own repairs) told me come back and they would try again. Didnt pay a dime yet but I plan on taking it back and giving them my business.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>We bought a rusted out 2004 Tahoe, it was in bad shape and needed a lot of work. These guys really took care of us. They took there time and went through the vehicle from top to bottom and advised on what to fix and in what order . They really took care of us . Very pleased with the service and the professionalism. It’s also nice to keep things local.
Thank you Ramona auto works</Text>< userid>

<review>I own a truck that should not still be moving under it's own power. Everyone uses it to move, haul garbage, head to the desert and otherwise beat up. While it is surprisingly strong, it needs things. It needs fixes that ideally don't cost an arm and a leg. It needs an honest assessment from a professional like Sal at Ramona Motor Works. Three times I've had it in for issues that have the potential for costing a bunch. Each time Sal and the Folks at Ramona Motor Works came back with solutions befitting the age and pedigree of my truck. I just want to thank them for be honest and understanding where this truck fits in my life. So thanks. And thanks to the front desk staff too. Alway pleasant. Always.< /review>< rate>

Sal and team are courteous, professional and honest. They replaced my brakes on a same-day, walk-in basis and didn't try to over-sell me (they told me I only needed the front brakes done and that my rear brakes still had plenty of life in 'em). I appreciated the honesty because we all know how we are at the mercy of the mechanic when we take our car in. Highly recommended.<//text>

Awesome customer service.  Sal and his team are top notch.  Received a quick, fair, reasonable quote.  After dropping off my vehicle, Sal was quick to check out our issues with the car and respond with repairs that were deemed urgent and others that could wait.  He wanted to make sure he took care of the most necessary repairs first and made sure we understood some of the repairs we asked for could wait till a later date if we needed to watch our budget.  When we picked up our car, we had an issue with our check engine light coming on.  He took the car back the next day and researched the reason for the check engine light - even though he didnt have to. Come to find out there is an issue with my model year car throwing  bogus codes from the ECU.  Sal went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with the service he provided.  He is a warm and welcoming man, and his front office receptionist is helpful as well.  I would recommend a visit to Sal first, before ever going to your dealership.< /Review>

<review>Sal and the gang at his shop run a high quality, clean, honest business.  Their communication and attention to the customer is outstanding. I've brought many of my vehicles (daily drivers and classic cars) here and in each instance they've done a great job at a fair price!  I highly recommend them!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I had my truck repaired today and it was the BEST Auto repair experience I've ever had!! Sal was very understanding on the phone. They even had to order a part and have it delivered! They had my truck ready in ONE hour!! The Mechanic that worked on my truck was very nice and explained the repairs that needed to be done. The repair was perfect! When I picked-up my truck they had washed all of my windows, which means allot to me because I have a shell on my truck and they and to wash 8 windows! I'm a woman and I have to stand on a chair to even reach my windows...so I greatly appreciated that! I recommend them to EVERYONE! They were also the least expensive of all the auto repair businesses in Ramona!< /text>

<text>I've found the unicorn of mechanics- I didn't know this actually existed!  Sal and his crew do quality work, stand by what they do, are honest and ethical, AND charge a fair price for their services.  I didn't think it was possible for all of those qualities to be present in one shop let alone to be local in Ramona!  I wouldn't take my car anywhere else.< /text>< user>

I  always get great service when I get my smog and oil change done here!  Not only that,  my car was cleaner than when I took it in, they washed my windows and even removed some sticky gunk from an old window sticker.  They also had it parked in the shade in the stall waiting for me when I came back as I told them what time I'd be picking it up and it was a scorching day.  I really appreciate the little details of good service!!! Thank you!  Kim<//text>

My wife and I gave Ramona Motor Works a try about a Year and a half ago as we were done with dealership service departments fabricated repairs and outrageous costs associated with scheduled maintenance. After our first visit to Ramona Motor Work we were delighted with the pricing and the service was truly superior. If you are looking for a fair, trustworthy, professional auto repair facility I highly recommend you go with Ramona Motor Works.<//Review>

< Review>
I have been trusting my maintenance and repair problems to Frank and Sal at Ramona Motor works for over 15 years now.  As soon each vehicle reaches the end of it's manufacturers warranty', all repair and maintenance is done by them.  I have found them to be 'right on target' with their assessment of any malfunction and with their well equipped and staffed facility, they have always be able to find and repair problems.  I have also referred multiple friends and family members to Ramona Motor Works over the years and they have NEVER been disappointed!!  Bottom line: the management at Ramona Motor Works is dedicated to provide maximum customer service in a professional manner, and always at a reasonable and  competative price.< /Review>

just pick up my 96 ford mustang for a oil change and ac recharge, I got a call saying my car needed alot of work, trans, tires, new ac system, I know my car is old and does need work, but that not why I went there they charge me for ac work that they couldn't do a 80 dollar inspection fee  plus a 50 dollar oil change they are not cheap like review say here, for me never go there again, just like the rest hiking up the bill.< /Review>

I had my list, and was able browse the selections(arranged alphabetically).  My expectations were exceeded.  The selection was tremendous, much more that your average nursery(and the prices are better). They were able to order 1 of the plants I wanted.  I will come here again.  Service was good.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
I spent some time at the nursery and loved it! There were so many plants of different sizes and varieties, and plants I didn't know existed.   Many of them I've seen used for landscaping in the community.  Robert & the team are an encyclopedia of information on everything in that nursery.  The people here are the kindness, most down-to-earth souls you'll ever meet.  One of the first and most interesting things I learned was that as a wholesaler, their goal isn't to provide the kind of customer service you'd expect to get at Home Depot.  The employees do their best to point customers in the right direction, but their focus is to keep the plants thriving, receiving new plants, and preparing large orders, among many other things needed to keep a nursery running.  Show up knowing what you're looking for or be OK to explore on your own, and when you have a question someone will be happy to help you out.<//Review>

They showed us where the plants we wanted were, described which were CA natives (and they carry a lot of natives!), and helped us feel safe by wearing masks and having effective safety measures in place. One staff member even followed up with us to make sure we had found the right plant. If you have a choice of nursery, there is none better! Just be sure to bring water because it can get hot out there.<//review><rate>5< /rate>< user_name>

The people working here are seriously rude and unhelpful. Even when you know exactly what you want, they make buying plants there a nightmare - screaming at people about where to park or not park, giving conflicting information depending on whom you ask, and making every process more onerous than necessary. Sure they have slightly lower prices, but is it worth the pain?</review>

They have the best selection California Native plants. They have more variety of natives than any other place in the local area.
However, do not expect ANY help from the staff regarding suggested plants for your yard/ or tips. The plants do not have a price tag. It is a cumbersome process of going to every plant you like with a pen-paper, noting size and description, then to the front desk, then wait patiently till the staff thinks you are important enough to be helped. Once you know the rate and decided on which plans to buy (you are mostly lost at this point because you have forgotten which plant looked like what and where was it located in the nursery. Then back to finding your plant, lugging it to the checkout (they have some carts, but no help). Then pay and load. Uff! They seem to want to only cater to experts/ bulk buyers who know exactly what they want, just pay and go. Unlike hobbyist who ask several questions.
Recommended for their collection and price, but not for a beginner plant enthusiast who needs any kind of help.<//Review>

Very bad customer service:
I went to this place to buy a lemon and an orange tree. I asked the man if they could show me where they were. He told me where they were and when I went there I saw that all the pots were tangled and without any information such as price, size and so on. It's true that they are a wholesaler, but they have to have general information, and when I asked him if he could give me the price, he said I need to take them to the office. But it was heavy for me to carry. Then he said it's a manual truck, but I can't find it.
Now that I'm unhappy with this, I said, "Wow, such a poor customer service. Now, instead of apologizing and trying to make me happy, he said, 'If you don't like it, don't come back - in a very rude and unprofessional tone! Obviously, after swearing at each other, he came towards my car and started shouting, "You're threatening me" While I was just thinking of writing this review.
Anyway, it was a bad experience for me and I may even forget abut planning a tree in my backyard.</review>

I love this nursery. It’s easy to view the stock, plant quality is excellent, and the prices are fair.
They also have some plants that aren’t often seen other places.
Staff is there to help you and answer questions , and they’ll let yo go roaming if you want. It’s my place for plants and I’m a designer.<//Text>

Unfriendly staff.   No prices available on all the plants you have to carry a heavy plant to them to check prices.  Very very ugly and heavy push cart build 50 years ago not only that only like 3-4 ugly carts.    Again service is really bad seems like they all hate their jobs.  Attitude is like who cares if you like it or not???</review>

Worth the drive if you are far, and huge selection. Very high plant quality, with good prices for the quality level. Great service but don't expect 10 people to swarm over you; they are oriented to pro's but during quiet times it's easy.<//review>

This is such a great hidden gem. I get a little lost every time but so worth it. They are NOT full service but they are huge! Set in the empty lot between houses under the power lines there is so much room. They will order you anything they dont have in stock. I love wandering about seeing what they have and day dreaming about the perfect garden!<//review>

They have a wide selection of all kinds of plants and trees with lots of California Natives. The natives are why I come here as they have more available than any other place in the local area. Not the friendliest or most helpful staff the times I have visited. Unless you going to shell out the big bucks to do your entire property they don't seem to be too interested in you. If you don't mind searching for what you want and helping yourself then this is a good place to go.</Review><Gmap_id>0x808e2d65c1dcccd9:0x84cfd521afe3e07f</Gmap_id>< Rating>

<review>Requested specific blue spruce variety that was not in stock.  They ordered it. Promised contact prior to delivery day. Delivery day confirmed. Promised time frame adhered to in addition to promised pre-delivery phone call.  Very good experience and the tree is a very nice healthy one.

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>This is a kind of place, that without the internet, you'd never know it's even here. We almost missed it when we turned onto the street and had to make a u-turn and drive over the curb, but once we got in there, it was very legit. And we were helped by a kind older gentleman who admitted he was new, but gave us lots of help anyways. We ended up buying a few plants and have found them to be very good quality, and they look great in our yard. The prices seem reasonable, even compared to big box stores. The selection is also pretty good. Plus we got great cell phone reception there as they are located on a strip of utility towers. :P<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Great customer service and a knowledgeable staff to answer my particular questions along the way while starting a new plan with multiple lines. Brent helped me while recommending other services and advising a certain direction in a more beneficial plan that works for me and my family. As a business owner, I must keep up with the changing times in picking the right phone, and quicker process of fixing my response times to my own customers through several apps and platforms on the go. Brent exceeded the standard through a high level of professionalism and communication while staying focused to my needs. The knowledge of technical terms and the business value of what AT&T stands for is well known by this individual and makes it easier for me to know this carrier is the clear choice. It may be easier to order a phone online, but the perks is leading you into the proper direction as to how I need to use it, not a box to the door. This business is on point at the highest level of satisfaction. Thank You Brent!< /review>

When I went into the Barstow store I was approached by a woman named Amanda Soto the reason I know her last name is because her customer service was so amazing that I needed to ask her what her full name was. Anyways, when Amanda approached me she had so much enthusiasm to help me with my visit at the store. Now, I have been to numerous at&t stores in Southern California and Amanda’s customer service is second to non! Thank you for providing Amanda to be a customer service representative to help me with my visit!<//Text>

AT&T’s got this promo going where if you sign up for a post paid plan, and wish to get a new smart phone, they will give you one for 50% off. Be it any phone, even the new iphone x, you’ll get it for half price.

Anyway, ours was overall a good experience. The salesperson was quite helpful and knew what he was doing. Nice and spacious store.<//Text>

The store phone number on line must be wrong because I've been trying to call it since noon and no one answers. It's now almost four o'clock pm and still no answer or callback.< /text>

Zero customer service. Store lights on. Three employees visible in store. Talking, playing with phones, dancing. 2-1/2 hours before posted closing time. Really needed a replacement SIM card. When I knocked on door while calling them they finally answered phone. They said closed for corporate meeting in LA. Yeah, dancing in store in Barstow sure looks like corporate meeting in LA<//text>

<review>Worst experience I have ever had with customer service. I have been fighting with them for a week!! My story.....I have a foreign exchange student that brought a phone from Norway, we went to a AT&T store they sold us a SIM card and a pay as you go contract. We thought we were all good. We went home and phone has NO SERVICE not just a little but NON. We go back to store they pretty much say sorry your out of luck good bye! I try to stay calm as my student is very upset that she now has an unusable phone but I persist right after work the next day we will go to a real AT&T store and they will make everything all better.
So day 2, as soon as school and work is over we head 45 miles into the other direction and go to a authorized AT&T store. They give us another SIM card. Tell us that the other SIM card was cut wrong, etc, this was suppose to fix it. It makes one call. We go outside the phone shows no service AGAIN. We go back inside and they tell us give it a little bit and it will work. So we do. We drive home and still NO SERVICE! So we slept on it!
So I call first thing in the morning. They just blame Apple! So I go with that. I talk with Apple for 2 hours. They walk me through every possible thing that could be wrong with the phone. We find out phone is unlocked and that it has to be on AT&T end. So I call AT&T...
Another 2 hr call we try everything. Power phone off and on, Reset each setting, open close, Power phone off and on, take SIM card out put in, Power phone off and on,etc, just everything you can think of. The phone still reads no service. They tell me go outside, raise phone in air, a glimpse of light 1 bubble than its gone. I'm relaying all this to the man on the phone. He just insists that the cell service area must be low or there is something wrong with the phone. I ask to speak with anyone that is in a higher tech service because I really felt it was a technical issue that just had to have a resolution right?!?!
Well no one helped. I was told wait 24 hrs and if the phone did not work they would refund my money. I was told that he would call me back and this would be handled. I sent my student off with her broken phone cut off from the world in hopes it was going to start to work.
Day 3.... NO SERVICE. I was only just beginning to understand that the NO SERVICE message I was getting on my phone was telling me AT&T policy. Anyways, I call customer service again. I asked them to pull up my notes. I get told they can't and to just tell them what I want. So let me say I don't start out happy. So I explain the whole thing. They say so sorry let me see what we can do, have you tried powering your phone off and on, needless to say I lose it!! We have tried all your tricks! They decide it must be that their service is not compatible with our phone. So, I want my money back! You can't fix my problem you should just refund my money!  You sold me something that never had a chance of working. I should be given my money back. They say there is NO WAY!!! How? How is there no way to give back money for a service we never received. At this point they ramble about maybe a credit towards a different month if we purchase a phone. Ok maybe but at this point I am so angry with AT&T I don't want there damn service!!
I want to take my money and go back to Verizon the company who told me from the beginning that their service was not compatible<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I wish I had found this place sooner. Huge variety of perfume oils.  The lovely woman who waited on us was very helpful and knowledgeable.  However, the owner is retiring. Most deservedly, I'm sure. You can order online, but visiting is quite a treat for the senses.  Pictured are two of my favorites.  Honeysuckle and White Rose. 🌹<//Text>< pictures>

This is a nice small mom and pop fragrance store that sells insent fragrance I travel over 20miles to buy them you could sit them in a cup and let it air dry with the smell up the house or you could light one of them and enjoy the fragrance if you want a different smell drive there and buy a few.< /review>

They’re always doing collabs and featuring other local businesses. They have an extensive catalog and has a special unique scent for everyone. Amazing long wearing oil-based alcohol-free perfume dupes !! #WomeninBusiness #BlackOwnedBusiness #ShopSmallSanDiego 🤩<//text>< Name>

Been going there since 2014 (approximately, maybe earlier) all I know is everytime i go it's almost as if I'm a college kid coming home, to do laundry and raid the fridge and get the warm feeling of being our 8f the cold. Guess it would be hard for any business to achieve this,  yet Garden of fragrance does it in high form . BRAVO!!!<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>After living in the neighborhood it took me almost 6 months before I actually stopped by this business. It only took one visit and have been a regular ever since. Super friendly service and a lot of options to choose from. I typically purchase the custom scent 100 pack and more 13 for $1, but on my last visit I was turned onto their body oils, recommended. I'm not going to say the scent but I remember her saying, "Lookout!". She was spot on and I'm loving it. Thank you GOF for your service. ✌<//Text>< Pics>

<text>This is a beautiful place to purchase sweet scents-oils, incense, perfumes. clothing and other items. Garden of Fragrance is run by kind and considerate people who make the experience there one you will always cherish. The shop is easily accessible by several freeways and major arterial streets. It is also close to Downtown San Diego, several shopping centers and local eateries and businesses. Garden of Fragrance is one of San Diego's jewels.</text>< pictures>

I just was introduced to this place. They have so many oil based popular fragrances that they can pour for you in the for of a roll on. It's oil-based so the smell lasts longer. They even have scents similar to the ones in Victoria secret s and bath and body works. There prices were not even expensive! I found my new fragrance home. I recommend to check this place out!<//review>

This is the only place I know of where you can buy pure Oil’s. No alcohol added. I believe the prices are reasonable when you consider that the fragrance last a long time. And they have so many fragrances. I put mine in a spritzer and people have commented on what a lovely fragrance I’m wearing<//review>

Selling long sticks, 13 for $1, or you can have a batch of your favourite made 100 for $5! Really high quality, also selling the oils as well. Great people running the shop, highly recommend to anyone who loves incense, good deals or just an adventure :) cannot wait to try all the smells out!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Peace be into you. This is a fantastic business that was established by our wonderful brother Yahya who trained his family in the biz to carry on after his passing. Everyone seems passionate about the oils & are pleasant, knowledgeable, and just in their dealings with you.</review><username>Rashidah Abdul-Khaliq</username><pics>None</pics><UserId.>105767593224892804963</UserId.><rate>5<//rate>< time>

< Review>
Just spoke to a saleslady at Garden of Fragrance and she was rude, condescending and uncooperative. She denied selling us a bad batch of African green musk. The scent disappeared in two weeks on an unopened bottle. She even claimed they had "no best selling oil" . They all sell "equally", she claims, in response for a recommended scent. Not a place I will go back to</Review>

If I could give this store extra stars, I would. Garden of Fragrance’s products and customer service are the best I’ve ever had. They genuinely want to help you find what you need and are willing to take the extra time and effort to find the perfect scents for you. They’re very kind and super knowledgeable and never disappoint!

The first time I visited Garden of Fragrance, I came with my sister to look for something to make our house smell better than something an air freshener could offer and were taken back by the overwhelming selection of scents they had! It was like a library of smells that could fit any mood or preference! Black Love is my family’s favorite home oil scents, but their kiwi strawberry one I was obsessed with!

My personal favorite however are their body oils! They have a huuuge range of scents to choose from, whether it’s simple lavender (which I love!) to boujie dupes (ie. Tom Ford and juicy couture) that smell EXACLTY like the real thing! The best part is that it’s a fraction of the price! Did I mention they last twice as long?? I bought the smallest oil that they sell two years ago and it’s still not even halfway empty! They’re strong scents that last all day because they don’t contain alcohol (which evaporate before you’re even halfway through the day). If I’m correct, you can even mix the oils to make your very own personal perfume, which kills me because I moved before I could make my Bath and Body Works vanilla lavender dupe ☹️

I might sound a bit too hyped about this store but that’s because I am! I’m all about smelling good and ever since I was introduced to this store, I can do so now without breaking the bank! What’s better is that I can still do it while in Europe now that I can order online!

Note: I wasn’t paid to write this review. I just really love this store! 🤗< /text>

As-salaamu alaykum, I remember years sgo when br. Yahyah had first started the fragrance oil bussiness. How greatful my brother an my sister and all the brothers that has helped along the way. I give five stars. may Allah to continue to help yourself help us. There was times if it hadnt been for the support of this brothers generosity,  my bussiness wouldn't have made it. Thank you br. Yahyah
Much love an respect to you and sister kalilah.

<Review>Victoria RV is awesome. I am driving through from Connecticut I needed a place to dump my camper. Price was very fair $15 to dump camper. The facility is new and clean. They have a dump, freshwater fill, compressed air for your tires and a power washer to rinse off your vehicle. I recommend Victoria RV<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Ridiculously over priced, this place use to be great until new management took control. Now they hired a new natzi security company that hovers over you and tells you to leave if you stay longer than 30 minutes tending to your RV. Now they want $500.00 a month to store your RV in a covered spot hahaha. As soon as a spot comes available at my new storage facility myself and all my buddies are pulling our stuff to another location. They are going down hill fast under the new management. If you are looking for a storage you might want to look somewhere else. Hopefully they fire the new management and get someone that knows what they are doing before she brings this place down.</Review>< Name>

The employee was very helpful and went the extra mile when we rented a tow dolly . We didn't have an adapter for the lights and she dug around the office until she found us one. Great service!< /Text>

<text>My family and I had an absolutely wonderful experience renting a truck here.  We made a mistake in misjudging the size truck we would need for our move,  but Wade went above and beyond to help us and saved the day.  I highly recommend this place if you want a quality experience.</text>< pictures>

This place is the perfect storage solution. It's secure, clean and it has a unique location near two freeways. It's biggest positive to me is that the facility is massive! Anyone who has ever tried to store a boat at a storage facility knows that it is almost impossible to navigate narrow pathways within the facility. This place has WIDE lanes for travel throughout the facility. It makes navigating and backing in as easy as it can be. Check this place out.</text>

<text>This is the best RV and boat storage in Rancho Cucamonga.  It's close to my house, and the people that work here are amazing.  I was worried about parking my new trailer because I've never towed before.  They took me around the facility and let me pick out the exact spot I wanted.  It's clean, it's convenient, its secure and the 24 hour access is an added bonus.  I'm looking forward to keeping my trailer here for a very long time.</text>< gmapID>

Heard of this place, seen it off freeway. It's got easy access close  to home. When we contacted them they were friendly and answered all our questions on the spot so they seem very knowledge about facility. They have 24/7 access to facility so you can leave without planning.< /Text>

Why did we wait so long? I stopped by while on a bike ride and was given the tour of the facilities...first impressions go along way, not only is the facility closer to home but is very clean! On site fresh water, air comp., pressure washer YES pressure washer! As well as dump station all in one convenient spot. Needless to say we moved in 2 days later. My experience with the staff has been 5 star all the way. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the site to anybody.</review>

<Text>We just moved into our 14 x 50 inclosed and are beyond thrilled.
The 24 hour access and the high level of security is priceless.  Jackie in the office made our decision to rent at this property a no brainer. She is sweet and very professional.  Susie & Corey B.</Text>< pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>When I heard about this place I went down and took a tour. They were very friendly and professional. After hearing and seeing what they had to offering I had to jump on an RV spot for my 31ft RV. The place I was rending hand old school key entry and was not open 24/7 like Victoria is. After being settled for about a month, one day I went to pickup my RV, but it wouldn't start. They bent backwards to get a jump for me. The best part is even during holidays their yard is open. The bottom line is you can't bet the price, size of lots and the state of the art set-up they have. Thanks Victoria RV your place is just what the doctor proscribed.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>April 2021. This location is only accessible through a small park that is apparently gated and locked up most of the time per other reviews.

There's virtually no parking in the immediate neighborhood unless you're a resident.

To my surprise, when I got there the gate was open - so I was able to park in the small parking lot.

This is a beautiful spot with clay banks by the river. There are some trails into the wooded area away from the houses overlooking the river. When I was there there were two young guys collecting garbage and hauling it out - which was great to see!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>One of my favorite spots at the river but it does get over crowded sometimes. *theres no parking at Sarah Court, everone has to park down the street in the neighborhood in front of one of the nice houses.its about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the river.< /Review>< userid>

Nice place for river access in a Carmichael neighborhood. Free parking, one picnic table, about 10 parking spots. There are metal steps that take you down to the claybanks along the river or you can walk down the path which is steep but not too difficult.<//Text>

<text>They have locks on the parking gates but no sign indicating why!!? I try to look on the website for river access I don’t see anything. I heard there trying to make you pay to park which is absolutely ridiculous. I understand some spots but this place it’s not even that big enough! I guess its because it’s by houses Nice scenery peaceful no sand unfortunately!<//text>< user_name>

Though small, this is a great spot for relaxing on the American River. There is a small grassy area and a single picnic table, but access is severely limited by an 8' tall iron gate and fence which is more often locked than open.</text>

Nice river access, pretty secluded as there is no parking, you have to find parking elsewhere and walk over. Its a nice place to swim, relax and enjoy the wildlife. There is a beaver family that lives there.<//text>

This place is terrible. There is always garbage on the ground. I always see some homeless person camping out here with all their junk or creeping around. You cant park anywhere around here either. The whole neighborhood is marked no parking. Dont waste your time. Theres no bank to chill on... bird doodie all over the place. The river environment is ever changing so I check this place out during the summer...I'm always picking up garbage here. Try River Bend instead. Its across the river off of Folsom Blvd. It has a huge picnic area beaches and plenty of trails for short and easy hikes.</Review>

Very nice small park and river access. You will have to be dropped off as there is no parking on nearby streets.</review>

No 5 stars as the homeless population also knows of this spot. Not many, but they are there with all their bags so they are very noticeable. They left me alone though.<//Review>< name>

< review>
I have been applying for apartments with C&C for almost three weeks now and the lack of guidance and customer service for potential renters has been disappointing. I have reached out several times for additional information on units/my applications and the customer service team that answers the phones are very little help. They are quick to say they do not have the information on hand and to just keep checking the website. I wish I had read all the reviews beforehand because this appears to be a consistent issue with C&C. Save your money and time and go elsewhere for rentals. I would not recommend as this process has felt like a scam.</review>

I would not recommend C&C Property to any potential renter. Save your money, time, and energy. It is in your best interest to read other reviews as most of us potential renters have encountered the same issues.

C&C process for potential renters is to submit an application ($25 fee per applicant) and within the three month period, apply up to 6 rentals. Example, if you apply to a unit and the lease goes to another tenant, you are eligible to transfer your application to another unit that is available for rent and not have to pay the application fee again.

I have applied to three different units within C&C and the process has been similar to pulling teeth. No one in the office has been good at communication or advising why my applications have not been accepted. I have emailed Mel Lagrama several times for additional support only to have my emails and calls unanswered. I’ve asked to speak with Mel’s supervisor for additional support and of course, radio silence. I have yet to hear back from C&C.

The customer service team that answers the phones are not additionally informed about the rental properties listed. When you call for more information about a unit (which is stated to do so on their website) they only have access to what is already listed on their website. The phone answering customer service team has little to no information to guide you.

Additionally, the rental postings do not have all needed information such as square footage, laundry situation, outdoor space, etc. I’m not clear on why they do not require this information from properties before posting. A lot of the info and pictures are quite minimal and then have a customer service team who knows no better, makes it frustrating. Who is the subject matter expert and where are they hiding?

I have asked for a refund for my application fee and while they are very quick to advise that it is NOT company policy to provide refunds,  when asked what their company policy is on assisting potential tenants/renters, there is no answer.

Three weeks in and I still cannot get anyone to contact me back but my money was taken quite quickly.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. My experience with C&C has just been the worst and with moving already being a stressful and expensive process, they have done their very best at being a waste of good time and money. Never again.< /review>

<review>Communication started out ok but completely fell apart.  Multiple attempts to get information on a property, VM's unanswered, Emails not returned by even the owner of the firm when time lost/delayed means losing the property and future business.  Complete lack of caring by the whole team.  I would highly suggest using another firm at least for short term rentals of 30 to 60 days.  But if their follow up with us is bad for that part of the business, I can only assume the sales part of their business is probably similar. But in fairness I was not buying.<//review>< Pics>

Due to work commitments, I was in desperate need to find a new apartment. A colleague told me to contact C&C Property Management and before I knew I was settled into my new apartment. They made me look at a few properties and made the whole process go very smooth. If you are looking for an apartment in Monterey, CA, you should definitely contact these guys!!< /review>

<Review>This is one of C&C Property Management scams. My girlfriend & I put in an application for an apartment with C&C (good way to collect $25 per application, and the application fee is good for only 3 months). C&C stated to us that even though they had numerous properties that we can only apply for one of them at a time, and they continued to leave the ad for the apartment up for 2 weeks. During this time they probably collected numerous applications for the same apartment. Their reasoning was that “they are waiting to hear from the owner and provide them the applications”. Btw, very rude and banal agents on the phone.

After going back and forth with them for 2 weeks, they sent us an email stating that we were not chosen, and now we can get on a list for another one of their properties and go over the same shenanigans again.

Basically, you get 6 chances at “renting” one of their properties for $25 and after 3 months you’d do it again. What a great scam.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>I was supposed to see an apartment but they sent me an email with the wrong address. After we figured it out, the showing agent told me he had other showings and couldn’t wait for me (despite the fact that he was late to my appointment, so clearly, being punctual isn’t important to Trevor), when I said that since it was their fault I had the wrong location, and he really ought to wait, he hung up on me. I called the main office to complain and Melanie, who answered the phone, refused to let me talk to a manager and instead told me it was my fault that I went to the wrong address. With customer service this horrific, I don’t know how they stay in business.<//Text>< pictures>

Properties themselves: 4 stars
Service as a prospective tenant: 1 star
Service as a current tenant: 2 stars

Company could be understaffed, as agents rarely return calls or respond to online applications. Agents on the phone were twice short with a stand-offish, unhelpful tone.

I own properties myself and based on recent interactions as a customer, I'd be very disappointed to have them manage my own properties.</Review>

<Review>We recently inquired about a property for rent in the Monterey area and it was extremely hard to get in touch with this company. We called 4 different times sometimes leaving voicemails over the course of 3 days and finally the 5th time we called we got through to someone only to have them tell us they would relay the info to the property manager for that property. We waited one week, never received a call. We went ahead an scheduled a tour of the home through the online website Rently. In the meantime we went ahead and filled out our application online( big mistake) just to have it ready to go in the case that we liked the property. The appointment day came and we went. The manager nor anyone else working for the company showed up to greet us or even give us a courtesy call. We knocked on the door and the owner of the property just so happened to be there cleaning up some things. She was super friendly and helpful. After viewing the property we decided we wanted to go forward and again spent several days trying to get in touch with ANYONE that works for this company but no one picked up the phone. We get super skeptical at this point but decide to just leave a voicemail and also email the company in hopes that they are just extremely busy and can’t answer their calls ( we were being totally gracious here). A few more days to by and we do not hear any response via email or phone call so we call one last time only to get the SAME EXACT response as the last time we had finally gotten in touch with someone, saying that the property manager would reach out to us and answer any questions. It never happened....about 5 days later the listing was completely removed. They got a nice application fee out of my husband and I as well as this lovely rating. Such a waste of our time!!!! Will never ever reach out again for any property they list even if it’s perfect and will never ever recommend this company to anyone I know. A scam and joke company!!!!!!<//Review>< Rating>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I never write negative reviews because I am normally a very understanding person who gets that sometimes things just happen but the management of this company has pushed me to a breaking point. I have been dealing with ROACHES for MONTHS. Every time I contact them to resolve this disgusting issue they send out a pest technician to treat only our unit(and apparently a few others that actually reported the issue as well). Unfortunately it is impossible to get rid of insects like this without treating the entire building which they refuse to do. We will always have roaches because of this while living here, so if you plan on moving into the 351 Dela Vina location just be aware of this. I wish someone had warned us before we moved here from out of state.
It is also shocking to me just how unprofessionally we are responded to, if we get a response at all about this issue. My emails will not be answered for days and days at a time, or sometimes not at all, and they seem to find it okay to let the pest control company be the message man between us rather than take on their own role as management.
Their reaction to other problems such as plumbing issues is actually very fast and mostly efficient(we did have someone come out to fix our bathtub drain because it was not draining properly and the plumber said that it would just always be like that because the pipes were so old). There is also no ventilation in the bathroom so we constantly have to scrub mold out of the grout of the shower tiles.
Currently I’m still fighting to be heard about the roaches now in June when the problem arose back in February.</review>< Pics>

My properties were a huge mess before I found C&C Property Management. I wanted to save money and thought I can manage them all on my own, but eventually everything went bad. C&C Property Management really took on a huge role to get my properties back running how they were suppose to. They offer great pricing and the work they do is unbelievable, they are very professional and organized. I no longer have to worry about any of my properties or tenants they manage it all! Such a pleasure working with them!</Text>

I feel at ease knowing C& C Property Management is taking care of all my properties while I am out of state. Finding a good Property manager is very complicated they all promise the best yet don't deliver it at the end. But with C&C Property Management they have really showed me otherwise, they deliver all they said when meeting them for the first time. I recommend them for any property management!!!</review>

Quick to take your money but ignore your questions, concerns, calls, texts & emails (unless you're the property owner). Makes me wonder why they receive a portion of my rent each month to "manage" the property. Stay away from this shady, unprofessional, incompetent outfit. Companies like this truly make me miss being a homeowner 😔< /Text>

C&C Property Management failed to show any sort of professionalism from the moment I signed my lease.  They're liars, cheats, and highly unprofessional.  I have to constantly follow up on email to get a simple work order completed and they clearly neglect the common areas of my apartment complex.  They should be cleaning the laundry room in my apartment complex --especially during COVID-19--instead, it wreaks of mildew and the layers of dust is an eyesore.  When I first moved into my apartment, my neighbor who has lived in their property for quite sometime shared with me that they're the worst property management company to deal with (great thing to hear as a new tenant!), and she wasn't wrong.  ALSO, they rent out apartments ABOVE nearby market value, yet fail to provide ABOVE market service.  AVOID AVOID AVOID renting from these con artists!!!</review>

C&C Property Management helped to find our new home and they did it perfectly. We got everything we wanted and under budget. They have actually been proactive regarding maintenance and building security & prompt to notify me of any upcoming arranged services. My life will be better for the next several years, thanks to Kyle knowledge and guidance.< /review>

They were the worst property management company I have ever worked with.  My apartment leaked in over 10 places and the didn't work.  During the winter time it got as cold as 40 degrees inside.  I called and put in over 5 work orders without having a response from the company.  The only way I got a response was to visit them in person, and when I did they were disrespectful and not very helpful.  I would work with any other property management company over them.< /Text>

C & C Property Management is the best! The agents and other staff are amazingly wonderful and helpful. If I could give more than five stars, I would, because Kyle & C & C Property Management is truly a phenomenal real estate agent. I would highly recommend them to everyone. We are first time buyers and were guided the whole way through this crazy process with such care and professionalism. We are so new to all this but they never made us feel this way. They not only got us our dream home, but they made the process seem like a piece of cake. Extremely detailed and patient and on top of all this. I really can't imagine getting any better service than this. They are undeniably the BEST.</review>

C&C property management is a great property management company, the best one we had, by far. Anytime we have a question or a concern we get responses fast, its a proactive company not a reactive. As i read other review there are some negative comments from homeowners towards their boards that have nothing to do with C&C property management. Thank you for helping us enjoy our homes!</text>

Do not rent from this company if you can avoid it. They are not truthful, and possess horrible customer service. The deposit you pay is not for your own security, it’s to pay the fees that it costs to get a home re rented such as a 315 dollar cleaning fee, 65 dryer vent cleaning, and 30 dollar light bulbs. A security deposit is for if their are damages that are done from the time you move in to the time you move out. This company lies about what repairs that were needed and take it out of your deposit! They also screen your calls if they are trying to avoid any conversation about this topic. They advertise that they take excellent care of their properties, when really they delegate this work to outside companies that are not reliable or acceptable. The water line broke when we were in the property, and the plumber stated that the pipes were needing of a full repair, but in the year we lived there it never got fixed. We moved out of the home and left it in a better condition than what we received it in, yet got charged for things that were broken when we moved in such as a light switch and window screens.<//Text>

They were easy to work with when it came to lease improvements and other adjustments that were needed. The staff of C&C Property Management has been great all these years and it's because of them and the community that they have created that keeps me here. I highly recommend both them and their properties.<//Review>

C&C were on point from the get go! They were very helpful and courteous! The staff were on our team the whole way through. My experience with C&C was really amazing. Professional and patient. The property is quiet, well groomed (with a clean laundry facility), and has very reasonable rent.</text>

These guys will go out of their way not to do work for their tenants. All they will do it "document it" so that you won't be charged. They will also lie to you about dates and timing of apartments coming available, because I found out when I moved that that is what they did to me. I will absolutely be finding a new place to live and new property managers when my lease is up.<//review>

I rented an apartment in a property managed by C&C Property Management for 1.5 years. I had a great experience with them the entire time -- the entire staff was friendly, quick to respond, on top of matters, super helpful and accommodating, and just overall good people. With property management companies, you never know what to expect, but they were wonderful.

I'm very pleased with C&C Property Management and would recommend them!</Review>

C&C were amazing Property Management Company. On top of  being very responsive, and easy to talk to--they were on top of game with knowledge about the rental market. They'll also do research and send you comps right away. Their fees are reasonable as well. Will definitely use them for future property management.</Text>

<text>After my first attempt to rent out a single family property in C&C Property Management for close to 3 months, I contacted My. Kyle. he was thorough, timely, and informative in her response. Within a few days of signing listing agreement, he brought multiple interested parties and almost all of them seemed to be well qualified. It took about a week or so to choose my tenants and close the deal. It was a smooth ride and I highly recommend Mr. Kyle.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

<text>Kevin and Vicky at C&C are the best. While I ended up renting a property elsewhere their service is unmatched and their reviews show why they are so much better than the other leasing companies in the area. From Vicky taking awesome video tours when I couldn't make an appointment to Kevin following up with me each day to explore different properties that suited my needs. Make C&C your go to for rentals in the Monterey area</text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I think this is atypical, but C&C property management has been one of my worst real estate experiences to date. The root of the issue is mainly in communication with a customer service representative, Spencer. He leaves cryptic, non-specific voicemails and then is impossible to reach by phone for hours or days afterwards. This has happened in four separate occasions over the last ten months, with issues ranging from maintenance requests to adding a tenant on a lease. Perhaps it is simply that he is misinformed or untrained, but my experience with C&C has been tainted by my interactions with their customer service.< /Text>< pics>

C&C Property Management is a great property company. Their properties are reasonably priced and are kept up nicely. The management company is very nice and willing to work with you. I lived in one of their properties and I had such a wonderful experience. Thank you C&C Property Management.</review>

This is the only store that Carrie's american spirit - dark blues. The staff is great and they have a lot of miscellaneous things in there that you need around the house. Prices not bad and they're next door to Cobbs Hardware - so you can kill two birds with one stone while supporting your local merchants.</Review>

I've been visiting this salon for 6+ years and have never had a bad service. For two years I've had the pleasure of having Ingrid as my stylist, and there is no doubt, she is the best at what she does. If you want a quick haircut exactly like your last one, she will do you up well. If you are open to recommendations or a new style, Ingrid is always happy to give her style suggestions, which are always stylish and clean. Expect friendly conversations and relaxing head massages!
Another service done so well are her facial cleanings. Every since my first one, I have yet to NOT get this extra service. For what seems like an eternity, you get to relax with a hot towel, face and neck massage, and of course a great cleansing process. And you always leave feeling so clean and relaxed!
I have never left her chair disappointed, and I look forward to each visit!<//text>

<Review>I’ve been getting my hair done by Ingrid for the past several months. She’s gotten my hair through the pandemic to say the least and hasn’t sacrificed quality or experience for safety.

I so appreciate her warmth and great conversation as she cuts and styles my hair. She’s super service-oriented and thoughtful about what I want each and every appointment. I highly recommend Ingrid!</Review>< username>

<Review>Over the last 4 years I have been getting my hair styled by the most talented and incredible stylist I have ever experienced - Ingrid. Thank you Ingrid for your excellence and how much care you put into each experience. Not only does she cut my hair but she also gives the best eyebrow and facial skin care treatment that is the highlight of each visit. You are truly gifted and I don’t think I could ever go anywhere else again. I give me heartfelt recommendation!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Ingrid is the best. Asian hair can be hard to cut and style but it's never been a problem for her. It's so hard to find a hair stylist that you click with and who can understand your hair needs; I have been seeing her for over a year now and it's always been a professional and pleasant experience each time. I definitely recommend Ingrid!<//review><pics>None</pics></record>

IN Style Salon is my new haircut place. This was my first time seeing Ingrid. I made an appointment with her, and she was able to get me in the day after! She is vey professional, and nice to talk with. I originally made an appointment for a haircut, and also a beard trim & line up. When she saw me she suggested me to have a hair & beard coloring as well as I had some grays. I was hesitant at first as it was my first time to do coloring, but the results came out great! Overall I had a great experience! I will be returning to her for my next haircut as well. Thanks Ingrid!</review>

Ingrid has been great to work with and definitely knows a lot about the products that are available and what will work well with your hair. The cuts are superb whether or not you are getting a trim, a blowout, or going for a completely new look there is no better place to go and no better person to visit than Ingrid at IN Style Men’s Salon.</Review>

<date>1594245455900< /date><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>One of the best haircuts I have ever had. They were professional from the get go. Ingrid who was my stylist was amazing all the way around. She talked about my hair and gave me tricks on how to style it better. Never had any stylist do that before. I'm looking forward to my future appointments with Ingrid.

You can't go wrong with any stylist is the place by the way. I noticed that all the other stylists appointments were regulars which is a positive sign.< /Review>< Pics>

Ingrid has cut and colored my hair for years now. She even talked me into waxing my nose and ears... She is a pro at this...Somewhat painful but totally worth it! She is the best and is VERY consistent with the quality in service, scheduling, cut and hair color. I'm very particular and have continued see Ingrid because no one has consistently delivered like she has! I don't plan on changing stylist anytime soon. Keep up the great work Ingrid!< /review>

<review>So I saw this place after coming out of Smart and final and decided to get my haircut today.
(The place where I went to get my hair cut for years is closed and no sign of opening soon).

It’s been along time since I’ve sat in a barbers chair but I’m glad I did because they did a great job.

Andy cut my hair and i think he did a great job. I give him a five out of five star excellent job. I will come back and would recommend them for anybody looking for a good honest haircut.< /review>< Pictures>

I've been getting my hair cut by Ingrid for over a year now. When I started coming I was just doing a simple fade cut (which ironically is like the hardest thing to get done right apparently). Ingrid always nailed it though and I never had to go home and do my own minor touch ups like I had to at other salons. I decided to do a more medium length cut and Ingrid was awesome about letting it grow out and avoiding any awkward stage. She always cut it perfectly and showed me how to style it based on the length it was at. She would go above and beyond to make sure I liked my cut. Aside from the great cuts, Ingrid is super personable, making for good convo while you're getting your haircut.

Out of all the men's salons I've tried in Southern California (a LOT), IIngrid at N Style Men's Salon is far and above the stylist/salon I'd recommend.</Text>

There is no better hairstylist I have ever had than Ingrid. I have seen her for the 4+ years and she always does an unbelievable job. She takes great pride in her work, pays amazing attention to detail and you will always leave feeling better than when you walked in. I cannot recommend her enough to any man who is looking to take themselves to the next level. The best.</Text>

I have been a consistent customer of Ingrid’s for 2 years now. The reason why I return regularly is you won’t find someone more reliable, knowledgeable, and friendly in her field. You’ll enjoy some great conversation and leave feeling like a million bucks. I don’t leave reviews often, but I’m disappointed it took myself this long to do so. Keep up the great work Ingrid!< /text>

A great place, everything is top notch. I recommend this place to anyone that takes self interest in their appearance. Ingrid has been taken care of me each month for some time now. I haven't found anyone to match her service in a long time. Ingrid is very friendly and professional.

<review>I’ve been going to Ingrid for over a year now  and she has been spectacular.  I tend to change my hairstyle often and no matter what I end up deciding on, she is a perfectionist and gets it right every time. She always puts in extra work and will stay late just to make sure I’m 100%  satisfied with it.  She also  offers a variety of other men’s skin care services so she keeps me looking and feeling good on the regular. Thanks again for a great salon and a great stylist!< /review>< pics>

I just got married,  so my stylist, Ingrid who I absolutely  love, blended out my gray, gave me a terrific haircut and a facial so I looked my best on my wedding day. My fiance, now my wife was very pleased as well. Give this salon a try if you are not sure, I'm pretty sure if you go once, you'll be a repeat customer.<//text>< rating>

Update: I am now on my 2nd year of seeing Ingrid and I am still amazed by her amazing service!

I have been coming to get my haircut here for close to one year. I have tried some of the other services that they provide besides haircut, I would highly recommend trying them out. I find all of the stylist to be polite and very good-natured. My personal stylist is Ingrid, I can honestly say that I can not imagine having someone else cut my hair.
I can wholeheartedly recommend getting a haircut from her.<//review>

I am always skeptical about going to a new salon. Is it clean? Will they do a great job? Will I feel comfortable while I am there?

This salon truly is a hidden gem. I was impressed with their level of customer service. I was greeted and asked if I wanted water, Soda or tea while I waited for my stylist another observation about this salon, cleanliness is key.

Ingrid was my stylist and I will most certainly be back to see her! I handed her a stack of pictures and we briefly decided on a few styles that would compliment my face shape and what outcome I was looking for. No pressure to do this or that, she wanted me to be comfortable with my choice. I decided on a cut and color. Nothing drastic in the color but definitely chopped out some inches from my hair. I LOVE my haircut and have received multiple compliments on the style. Needless to say, I will be seeing Ingrid when I am due for a change and you should too! Ask for Ingrid!

Thank you In Style Hair Studio!<//Text>

< Review>
The nurses and front office workers were great. CORPORATE gets zero stars for putting incorrect information on the phone recording (that walk-ins are available until 4:30, but they’re actually 4:00 here, so I barely was able to get in, thanks only to the kindness of the front desk ladies). There was a line of a few people waiting due to the incorrect information. Maybe the people far away in corporate land should listen to people on the frontline and make simple corrections to incorrect information. Or maybe, like most faceless bureaucracies, they don’t actually care about their workers or patients.< /Review>

Great staff, very friendly and helpful. Easy location to get to and plenty of parking. The staff knowledgeable and explains everything you will need and there is never a long wait time. I can’t imagine how many people they deal with every day yet they are always cheerful and professional. I highly recommend this office.<//Review>

My experience was and always is a good one.  The rooms where the test are given are nice and the technicians are very pleasant & very nice!  This is my image center of preference.  Appointments are almost always prompt.  That important to me, especially in this time of Covid.<//Review>

My experience was and always is a good one.  The rooms where the test are given are nice and the technicians are very pleasant & very nice!  This is my image center of preference.  Appointments are almost always prompt.  That important to me, especially in this time of Covid.<//Text>

I was processed timely once I was in the office.  The technician was efficient and pro Utica and answered all my questions.  Only not so good thing was when I arrived I sent a text of my arrival to the number given and waited in my car but did not hear back so I went into the office, so that process didn’t work.  Thanks<//review>

The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. The wait time was less than 10 minutes and the procedures were done quickly and thoroughly. I enjoyed the conversation greatly with the ultrasound technician. She made my experience even more less stressful. Great place to get imaging done. Would recommend.<//text>

Quick and Easy! Got there at my appointed check in time (20min before) and then they took me back at my exact appt time .

Just one minor criticism... especially because we wear masks now and are so socially distanced ... A bit of ‘small’ talk by check in and the tech would have been nice.  Something like “Hello”, “Good morning” “ How’s your day”</text>

Well I waited for several minutes and was told to wait in a couple of different rooms and then I got hungry and thirsty.  I told a lady I needed some water, then I waited for several minutes, Then I went home, that’s it, I do not have the same patience as I used too, I am 78 years old and I don’t have enough time left to be jacked around by inefficiency while trying to get a MIR performed, thank you so much.

It began by being canceled on DAY OF, less than two hours to my appointment tome, because their ultrasound tech was a no show... Then after waiting for the rescheduled date, I am told over the phone the day prior that I will be called back in regards to what I would owe. John never did so. Instead, when meeting me face to face he blames it on someone else saying “someone was to call you - turns out we aren’t within your network” I found two things wrong with that reply... HE said he would be the one to call me back and for finding out my insurance was actually not within their network was certainly a reason to ensure I got the memo! I step out to call my insurance company and after they gave MCIC a call, they found they were incorrect and that they were intact IN network! Kim took the call from my insurance rep, who then informed me I would AGAIN need to RESCHEDULE! I demanded that I be seen, as it was only 20 minutes passed my appointment time and wouldn’t have had been delayed had it not been due to Jon’s incompetence. Kim again said I must reschedule. That’s when I spoke with her manager, who saw I was rather perturbed and MAKE IT HAPPEN. They were probably scared of me at that point, but THAT’S WHAT YOU GET!

Place sucks!!!<//review>

This was my second time there and everyone from the beginning to end were very kind.  I was remembered and was taken care of just like the last time I was there.  From my MRI to this time a ultrasound the technicians were caring and knowledgeable to my issues.  Their a great group and very helpful.</Text>

John at the front desk promptly registered me and was clear and concise. He was very professional and made sure all my information was correct and up to date. Then Dawny the Ultrasound took me back probably just a few minutes after registration and was very good about explaining every aspect of my test. She was very detailed to make sure she measured specific images that needs to be compared to the previous years of ultrasound. I felt that technologically, I was in very good hands and that she did her job very completely and with perfection. She also made me feel very comfortable throughout the test and gave me all the information I needed as to how and when my doctor and I would be getting results. I can’t applaud this facility enough. I’ve always had the best care here at MemorialCare Imaging👍🏻Thank you!!!<//Text>< pictures>

Confirmed before the appt a half dozen times that I needed a cd of the images. They said be there 15min early so I did. Ended up waiting 45min and then they claimed their network was down so they couldn't print me a cd even though the MRI machine runs on the network🤦‍♂️<//text>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>The ultrasound tech lady was great! Super understanding with my wiggly 4.5 month old and super accommodating as I nursed her to get her to stay still. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they didn’t call us back until 20 min after our appointment time which is a long time when you’re trying to time out naps and feedings for a 4 month old not to be cranky during an ultrasound (and since they told us to check in 20 min before our appointment time already anyways). But once the appointment got going, 5 stars all the way!</text>< Pics>

<text>Service was great. They got me in and out quickly. I didn't have to fill out 20 pages of medical history.  There were no parking spaces open in their lot so show a few minutes early to wait for a spot or take your chances in the neighboring lot. Overall it was a good experience.

<Text>Laguna Woods, It's not safe. They don't screen
people as they enter the building. Their is no protocol. Was supposed to receive links to online documents, this didn't happen. So, texting "here" like the building info says did nothing. Really disappointed. Changed appointment to the San Clemente office from laguna woods. Which was a little bit better. But the attitude of the office staff is really bad. I understand they are front line workers. But, it's safer at some grocery stores than these imaging places where you KNOW Covid-19 people are.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Rate>1<//Rate><name>Lisa Miller< /name>< Time>

<review>Waiting room was not social distanced.
When I got there I was the only one then it was crowded and some people werenot wearing masks properly.
Chairs should be out in the hall for seating to be correct or  space your  r appointments

Tech person was fine and so were the desk people.

I just was surprised  how bike Covud  safe you were.

Also no temperature checks.

Super nice, friendly staff. Didn't have to wait for anything.  Front desk gave clear directions and back office did as well. I have and will continue to refer family and friends to your facility.  Thanks for a quick and painless experience.< /Review>

Technician went above and beyond to accommodate concerns that work order didn’t cover complete area needing ultrasound.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Kim at reception is very courteous and efficient when checking patients in. She was friendly and welcoming, and explained anything I had questions about. Her male coworker was friendly and welcoming as well. The waiting room was comfortable and I waited 15 minutes with 4-5 other patients. My x-ray tech was also very friendly and efficient while I had several images taken. I felt very comfortable with her. I love this imaging center and have never had anything but positive experiences with them.</Review>< Pics>

Efficient, proffessional,  and yet very warm individuals doing very important work.  These  people are quick and exact and do not waste any time.  The facility was clean and parking suprisingly open as people were coming and going regularly.<//Text>

Social distancing not enforced. I entered the small waiting room and there was a maskless woman blowing her nose seated in between two elderly people. No temperatures were taken nor other safety procedures done like other medical offices. The actual scan was professional but the waiting room experience was very iffy regarding covid safety.< /text>

< Review>
I was stuck in what I call “the worst construction traffic jam” as I only moved 50 yards in 20 minutes. I called the scheduling office and ultimately was transferred to the front office. They worked with me and actually made it work. I walked in and the the gentleman at the front desk verified my name and although the room was filled with other patients, he had me whisked away for my MRI. I am beyond impressed at the length they went to make my appointment possible. THANK YOU!<//Review>

All the staff are so friendly and nice, I live in Mission Viejo and technically they’re location in Laguna Hills is closer to me but I’m preferred driving 15 miles to San Celemente this is my favorite one, good location, friendly staff and they usually have a lot of Empty parking spots 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍< /Review>

They were very kind and patient
The waiting room was set up with social distancing in mind and rules for masks etc.. were posted in many places so as to encourage safety for all
My technician Danielle was sweet and patient
I thanked her for working during these trying times</review>

<Review>The front desk immediately greets you when you walk in even when they are extremely busy.  The wait wasn’t that bad.  The techs were all very kind and personable!  They even read our STAT X-rays right there for us and spoke to us about future care for my son.
You can tell the people working there care about the patients and like what they do.  My son and I thought the experience there was outstanding!<//Review><name>Cherie Brown</name>< pics>

Everyone is always nice and accommodating. Had MRI today and the technician was a joy. I liked the machine because it wasn't as claustrophobic as I anticipated. I could look up and see the through and it stopped it.</Text>

The ultrasound technician, Jessica, was thoughtful and made me feel very comfortable, while upholding to professional standards. The team went above and beyond to reduce my anxiety and the radiologist came in to go over my results and educated me on several questions I was concerned about. I felt heard and seen. Great experience. Thank you.</Review>

<text>Terrific experience.  Arrived for an abdominal ultrasound a few minutes early for the easy-going paperwork handled by friendly front desk staff, and promptly taken back for my appointment.  Very professional caring gal performed the ultrasound.  I could not have been more pleased with the whole process.< /text>< Pics>

Excellent experience.  The gentleman who was at the front desk let me in a half hour before they technically opened, and was super upbeat and helpful.  I didn’t have to wait very long, and was in and out of my appointment in no time.< /Review>

<text>As always my experience was just great.  I was taken in quickly and the technician went right to work.  Unfortunately, because of problems with the building, there was an earlier power outage that left problems.  He took care of the situation and made alternative decisions which went well.  He was able to think about the problem, determine a solution and work through it.  Its always good to find someone who doesn't just give up.  Thanks for your service.  Ken Virgin</text>< Pictures>

Although I was early for my appointment, I was taken in late and the last one in waiting room. Walk ins went in before me. The office was under construction and a mess. Signage to find check in was not good.

The technician once I got back to her was great!</review>

A pleasurable experience- check in staff were helpful -professional- courteous and efficient. MRI technician was prompt - professional - respectful- informative-by asking if I was comfortable while in the chamber and letting me know how long each test would take as well as letting me know how many more test were to be done as the process proceeded. compassionate  by asking if I would like a blanket to stay warm - I do not exactly look forward to having any test taken - but the staff made the process a lot easier - Good Job !!!!!!</text>

I had a great experience. Quick to schedule my appt. Desk staff checked me in quick and I waited 2 min for my tech. She was friendly and explained the procedure in detail which was comforting. My Dr wanted my result the next morning and they were very accommodating.< /review>

This use to be such a wonderful place with excellent staff but since it's become part of Rad Net, people cycle through there, and they're not the best with people skills, you feel like you're just a number sitting in a waiting room with lots of company. The front desk staff was very nice and polite and I was plenty early for my appt but the tech seemed rushed and whenever I would speak to her, it was more half listening with abrupt replies, not interested in me or my experience at all. Not sure if it was all her though, as I've seen employees leave one after the other, poor upper management has a lot to do with it. Nevertheless I've moved on and found a much friendlier and more efficient radiology center in the next town over that even my doctor prefers.<//text>

The staff put me completely at ease
I tend towards being anxious in tight spaces but the tech assured me that I would have no problem, and I didn't. The earphones helped but especially the light breeze of cool air once I was in the tube definitely helped me relax.  I would definitely choose this location the next time.<//Text>

This was the easiest imaging experience ever. I walked in with my doctor’s orders, filled out a little bit of paperwork and was called back within minutes. My chest X-Rays were completed quickly and done by a friendly and professional technician. I would definitely choose this place of business should I need imaging done again in the future.<//Review>

Although the people in the actual center were wonderful and very helpful, the reservation process was very difficult. Very long wait times on hold (20 mins and then 23 mins).  The person who answered the phone was almost rude .   I know everyone has a bad day now and then but if you are in customer service dealing with patients, you should at least have some phone manners and be able to talk to people civilly. I appreciate the people at the imaging center and know that they did a really good job today. However your call-center need some help and training in being nice.<//review>

I showed up a day early by accident and they fit me in their schedule with only a very short wait.  The place was clean and organized.  The technician and radiologist were nice and compassionate.  5 stars for patient care.

Now the bad.  Prior to making my appointment I called to obtain a quote as I knew I had not yet met my deductible for the year and I knew that where I had gone in the past was very expensive.  I was given a quote and I even asked her to double check the amount as the quote was significantly less than my prior place.  I received the invoice - for 40% more than what I had been quoted.  I called to discuss the issue and was told that the quote I had been given was only an estimate and I needed to take it up with my insurance company as that is who my dispute is with.  I told them no, my dispute is with them as they were the ones that gave me the quote and I was not told it was an estimate.  I was then told that the papers I signed at the time of the procedure advised me that it was only an estimate.  Of course, they do not give you a copy of all the myriad of papers you have to fill out and sign.  So beware of obtaining quotes from this facility or asking how much something will cost because apparently they do not consider them to be anything they have to abide by.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

Everyone was fantastic!!! They were so caring, helpful & went out of their way to make my 11 year old son Max’s experience there comfortable. Monique at the front reception is literally one of my favorite people ever!!!! Max said she’s the coolest lady ever!!!! She sincerely cared for us & went way out of her way to serve us, and I also watched as she worked hard to help every patient who walked in. The radiologist was very thurough in his explanations & concern for my child. X Ray technicians were of good spirit! Thanks Memorial Care Imaging in San Clemente for making a tough couple days of x rays & MRI so much easier than ever expected.</Review>

The x-ray machine was down for several days starting March 31.  However, I was not in a hurry.  I checked every day until I learned the machine was operating on Tuesday April 6.  I went in at 1:40 and waited just a few minutes before Jody took me in the my right hand x-ray.  Within approximately 10 minutes, the CD was ready.  Very pleased.  The staff is accommodating and kind.< /text>

I had an appointment scheduled for an MRI with the San Clemente Memorial Care Imaging Center for Friday, November 29th. When I called to set up the appointment, this was the soonest they could get me in - a week out. I called every day that week to see if there were any cancellations for me to get in sooner. No luck, but totally fine.

The morning of my appointment, I received a voicemail at 8:04 from Laurie saying the tech did a "call out" and they wouldn't be able to see me. I called back immediately. The guy on the phone said there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to Laurie directly... he denied having a "Laurie" work at the office at all. At this point, I was very frustrated - I had already waited a week (in pain) and called every day to get in sooner. The man offered to reschedule me at the San Clemente location for the following Friday. I would have to wait another full week to get my MRI done.

From a customer service standpoint, I have a few issues with the San Clemente  Memorial Care Imaging Center.
1) Why do you only have one tech working to service MRI's? When people are injured or sick, they need prompt attention. To cancel a whole day's worth of MRI's because a tech called out sick isn't a smart (or ethical) business practice.
2)  If I am getting notified of a cancellation 45 minutes before my scheduled appointment, I expect your front desk staff to reschedule me as soon as possible. Having to wait a full week due to an error on your part is ridiculous. As it is, I am having to drive 45 minutes from my home to visit the imaging center in Newport Beach as they were the only clinic that could get me in sooner. The San Clemente location should be doing everything in their power to get me in and make this right.

I am beyond frustrated with the San Clemente Memorial Care Imaging Center.</text>

People at the front desk was wondering. They greeted patients within minutes once we walked into the office.  John was able to get me setup into their system and check-in for my exams in a timely manner.  Even the technician was wondering. I felt like I was in/out within 30 minutes!! Thank you for the excellent services!!</Text>

I went to MemorialCare Imaging Center in San Clemente today with requirements for X-ray, CT, MRI, and Ultra-Sound--some urgent and others routine.  Michele, at the front desk, was absolutely superb in taking the time necessary  to coordinate my requirements and work out a schedule, including accomplishment of one of the exams today--which was performed quickly, pleasantly, and professionally.  I completed all exams by mid-week and every one of the technicians was superb.</review>

The gentleman who helped me at the front desk was very personable and helpful. The X-ray technician was friendly and put me at ease. I didn’t wait very long considering it was a Friday afternoon. All in all happy with my experience here. Results at my doctors office very quickly too.< /text>

I don’t like needles so when the tech first put in my IV I was scared. Then when the iodine was put in it was stinging my arm. The tech could tell I was scared . He kept asking me if I was alright so it did make me feel better. Then told me what was going on every step so I felt better.< /review>

<text>The experience with this company was terrible. My appointment was booked 3 different times. The staff is either compromised due to poor systems and commmunixation or other?

They keep no records of contact with patients. The left hand dose not know what the right hand is doing.

As I sat in the waiting room this morning.. 2 other patients came in for their appointments and were told they were not on the schedule. Total confusion.

I won’t be coming back for any additional testing and I will not recommend this place to anyone.

On a positive note, the tech that did my MRI was great. Very professional and efficient. I’m sorry she has to take the brunt of frustrated patients most likely on a daily basis</text>< response>

Been a customer here for many years  Always well organized, well manged ..  professional.  Plain-film xrays are "walk-ins" but if your needs are different, appointments make the wait short.  Can view your results online from the comfort of your home.  Have your photo-ID and insurance info read and its a relatively quick experience.< /Text>

<Review>Nothing on the requisition for ultrasound said we needed an appointment, so had to go back the next day, even though the receptionist told us that hubby's doctor ordered it "stat" - so much for stat! There are no automatic doors at the entrance so handicapped hubby had a hard time opening the door while holding on to his walker. Then we had to wait for 45 minutes even though we got there 30 minutes before the test time. Very disappointed in this place. I used to like using coming here, used to be a quick in and out. I'm seeing it from a whole new perspective now...</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcf163d87d8c67:0x205dbec8091aed13<//gmap_id></record>

The front desk is really friendly, knowledgeable and go above & beyond to be helpful.

Technicians are very competent, friendly, professional & explain everything they are going to do and answer any questions you may have.  Also are very caring, which is nice when you may be a little scared.

Highly recommend this office. Will continue to be my Go To location.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>The wait time was minimal /mostly on time. The technician working with me was amazing and her experience was evident. She was so kind and gentle. Unfortunately the MRI procedure is very loud and not such a great experience. Hopefully technology improves that in the future.</review><resp>None<//resp>< Name>

Everyone was very professional and knew what they were doing scheduling and the procedure and care and the person doing the MRI with John and Mary at the front desk scheduling & suppling you with everything needed, as everything went smooth at the San Clemente imaging.
Thank you for everything!!!

<review>The experience with this company was terrible. My appointment was booked 3 different times. The staff is either compromised due to poor systems and commmunixation or other?

They keep no records of contact with patients. The left hand dose not know what the right hand is doing.

As I sat in the waiting room this morning.. 2 other patients came in for their appointments and were told they were not on the schedule. Total confusion.

I won’t be coming back for any additional testing and I will not recommend this place to anyone.

On a positive note, the tech that did my MRI was great. Very professional and efficient. I’m sorry she has to take the brunt of frustrated patients most likely on a daily basis<//review>< pics>

MRIs are not a pleasant procedure
It would be positive if the technician giving the MRI
Fully explained the procedure- how loud the machine and how long the procedure will be.
I would explain the ear phones are optional- they hurt my ears and I requested they be removed half way thru the exam</Text>

<review>Memorial Care Imaging always treats you like a friend and a guest. After I checked in, there was additional paperwork for me to fill out and I wasn’t feeling well. Rather that call me up the the reception counter, John brought the paperwork and a pen to me.  I arrived 45 minutes early and was taken early.  By the time of my appointment, I was on my way home!
Though I realize it isn’t always the case they do so their best to accommodate. Anytime I have to get imaging done, I call my insurance company and have the orders faxed over to Memorial Care.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcf163d87d8c67:0x205dbec8091aed13<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had an appointment for a procedure this morning that was originally scheduled at another vendor for a month out.  I was able to get into Memorial Care Imaging the very next day and had a great experience for everything from Registration to the actual procedure.  I highly recommend this great staff.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

People working here are nice and courteous. However, I had a 10:30 appointment. I arrived at 10:20 to fill out paperwork and was not taken back for my appointment until 11:30.  I should not have to wait for 1 hour when I have an appointment.< /review>

Very polite and professional staff. Had an order for a chest X-ray to get cleared for surgery next week. Chest X-rays are walk ins only so arrived with expectations that I maybe sitting for a while and to my surprise the whole process from checking in, paperwork and X-ray I was out in under 15 minutes!<//review>

I had an excellent actually better than excellent rapport with the people that are employed here and with the with the doctor himself I feel that they done an excellent job they're right on top of things and as far as I'm concerned you couldn't find a better facility to come to and have the work done !

< Review>
Horrible , they will not make an appointment for  radiology services. They tell you just to show up and it will only be a 10 minute wait. They are understaffed  end it takes over half an hour just to sign in.
They overcharged me, instead of collecting my radiology procedure co-pay they insisted that I paid my full annual deductible amount . Attempting to correct this with my insurance carrier but in the end term they’ve got my money. Will never return to this facility.</Review>

Very enjoyable experience. The girl at the desk is super friendly and will come out from behind the desk to open the door or give you your papers.  The actual mri technician talks tou they the entire procedure no surprises! She works within your own comfort level. I’m seasoned w mri so I can snooze thru them!
The cd is completed in 5 min or less
...... I called around to other mri locations and I had an appt the next day !! Thankyou!</text>

Service was excellent . there was a delay in seeing me. The scheduler created some confusion about whether I needed to be fasting and whether I needed a driver which was pretty inconvenient but the staff on site was excellent.</text>

< Review>
My Memorial Care experience couldn’t be better. Unitedhealthcare introduced me to the Memorial Care System. It’s so easy and convenient for me here in South Orange County.  I suggest you ask your insurance person to get you whatever policy works with Memorial Care. I only know it here in San Juan Capistrano, San Clemente, MissionViejo and Irvine, CA</Review>

In the 20 or so minutes I had left to wait to be callled in, I walked out in the hallway and made a phone call that took almost 20mins. As I was finishing up my call my name was called. My ct scan from walking in to walking out took less than 15 mins. And I was told my physician would have the results that evening.  All in all another good experience.

I was told to walkin and get barium drink and Labs. But there was no order for labs at San Clemente. The said go to ordering Dr. For LAb order and when I called ordering Dr. They said they would order labs but needed to know what Mem care required??? So Front desk went to Tech for CT and gave me the requirement.

Lots of delay. Someting was wrong with the process.< /text>

Dont use them if you have Tri-Care. They never get the referrals and when you show up for your appointment they will refuse your service. Much easier to google an imaging center that takes Tri-Care.<//text>

Caring staff, punctual, on time professionals that you can count on to minimize the inconvenience of having to schedule a procedure.  The process is certainly made
more bearable by knowing you're in good hands.< /Text>
