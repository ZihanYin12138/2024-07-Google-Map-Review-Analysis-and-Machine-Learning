The ultimate escape in the east bay… This place is an absolute paradise tucked in to the Hills of Sunol.  It’s pretty wild to even know this exists literally 5 minutes off the freeway yet you feel completely isolated tucked away into the beautiful rolling hills.  Come for a wedding, stay for a tasting ☺️.<//Text>

Every wine at Nella Terra is a delight; I love them all and the atmosphere in their outdoor tasting area is relaxed, friendly and beautiful.  I always order their charcuterie box - a beautiful selection of cheeses, fruits, meats and crackers - a real treat.  We were there today, sipping wine and listening to The Lavendar Fields acoustical band playing live while we sat under the trees.  What a great way to spend a couple of hours this afternoon!</text>

This review is for the bocce ball reservation during the pandemic! My husband and I actually had our wedding reception with Nella Terra back in 2015! We loved this venue so much flash forward to 2021 I emailed griffin at Nella Terra to reserve some wines and their bocce ball court for a couple of hours. It was great! My husband father in law, niece and her bf and my 3.5 year old and 15 month old had the whole bocce court area to ourselves and the bottles of wines we reserved were also laid out with ice buckets for us upon arrival. We also brought our own snacks and food.  It was a great socially distanced way to have fun. We all had our masks on and so did adam the staff. We definitely felt safe. Adam the staff was great upon our arrival and got us more wine when we wanted more for purchase. There were also two picnic tables available.  Overall I highly recommend this place for families and friends.< /Review>

The grounds were well-kept and the decor was perfect for each ceremony and reception. One reception had a buffet style and one had a seated plate. Both had great food! I was unable to try the drinks due to being pregnant but heard great things about them. The tent where the reception was perfect for when it got a bit chilly at night. Had a great time! Would love to travel to Northern California again for a wedding at Nella Terra!< /Text>< Resp>

I can’t say enough about this beautiful winery. From attending the most amazing wedding to joining their convenient wine club. Such a gift getting three bottles of wine that would pair beautifully with all my meals.  The wine club gives you so many benefits and convenient ways to celebrate any occasion. (I was referred by a friend)
I have always felt welcomed and treated like family when visiting the winery.   I can’t say enough about the staff and all the beautiful surroundings...and great wine!  Recently became a fan of Rose’. Nella Terra does not disappoint.  Thank you for being my go to winery, and making me and my guests feel welcomed.  Wishing you all great things for 2021! !</Text>

<text>I love Nella Terra. It is a beautiful location for events. I have been to multiple events since they opened and they have all been terrific. The staff is wonderful and the grounds are just perfect. I took my Mother to the Mother's Day brunch a year ago and she loved it as well. Scheduled tasting are great, even Covid friendly with hand washing stations! Perfect way to get out and enjoy some great wine safely. I suggest being part of their wine club too, such good perks. I can't say enough about this wonderful venue!</text><gmapID>0x808fc3ff763523cb:0xbd3314d79738a6f5< /gmapID>< Response>

< Review>
Nella Terra is our GO-TO wine venue whenever we have out of town guests or friends we'd like to introduce to this gem of a setting, or if we'd just like to spend an afternoon tasting fine wines surrounded by the beauty that is Nella Terra.

As Wine Club members we've been treated to seasonal harvest or launch celebrations which have included live music and delicious food pairings provided by their caterer On the Vine. We've also enjoyed their Mother's Day Brunch and were thrilled they' offered  professional photo sessions all arranged by the Nella Terra staff. I'm so looking forward to the day these celebrations can resume.

I also look forward to postings by Nella Terra on Instagram of upcoming  weddings. I was fortunate to attend a Nella Terra wedding when friends of ours  gave their daughter the wedding of her dreams. I must say that it was absolutely magical. From the moment the bride and her father began their entrance down the grand staircase flanked by beautiful vineyards  through the lovely ceremony to the signature drinks on the patio culminating with a fairytale like setting in the beautifully draped tent. I've been to weddings in the Livermore Valley, the Napa Valley, the Mediterranean coast of Santa Margarita, Italy, and I have to say that the warmth of the staff and the ambience of Nella Terra place it at the top of my list.

Follow on Instagram @nellaterra and you'll see that my words fall short. The photos are beautiful. I’m so impressed of late with the adaptations for Covid World small, intimate yet safe and socially distanced weddings. There are so many venue sites for the ceremony and myriad sites for spectacular wedding photos.The grounds are so expansive, social distancing for a large group seems quite doable. At 71,years of age, I still find joy in seeing everything from creative seating charts to tables scapes and floral arrangements. We’re fortunate to have this gem in the East Bay.

Nella Terra is a beautiful, unique and special venue. I recommend it highly.<//Review>

I attended a gorgeous wedding here in Summer 2019. The venue is impeccable and whole event ran smoothly from start to finish. The ceremony was stunning on a warm summer day with a breeze and a gorgeous sunset with views of the hills you can’t find anywhere else. Literally picture perfect. The reception was the most beautiful and was well organized and spacious for the band, dance floor and dining tables. The tent really made it feel intimate. The wines are delicious and as a club member I enjoy all the events they have hosted like Mothers Day brunch 2019 and the smaller tasting events througjout the year. It’s always a great little getaway to visit Nella Terra Cellars. Cheers!</Text>

I've been visiting Nella Terra for years as the property is gorgeous, their wines are delicious and the staff at their tasting room is so friendly.  That's why I was thrilled when a friend of mine decided to get married there.  It was an absolutely beautiful day as the venue allowed for so many custom details.  From the bride's grand entrance down the staircase to the shuttles that took us to our hotel at the end of the night, we had a blast and I know the happy couple did as well.  Would recommend to anyone searching for their dream venue!< /text>

I have been to this venue twice for two separate weddings and I just had to leave a 5 star because this place is amazing! The staff and owners are super helpful and friendly! Also the venue is so beautiful I’ll attach some photos as an example! I hope I can come back here again because I love this place!<//Review>

<review>Great spot! Great wine!
My husband and I attended the most beautiful wedding at Nella Terra! Our friends were lucky to find this hidden gem so close to home. The amazing venue has scenic overlooks, intimate walks, and beautiful landscaping perfect for any size wedding and every picture you and your guests could dream of taking!
The event was seamless from parking to the last dance. One of our favorite memories was wine tasting on the patio during cocktail hour. Our friends exclusively offered wine from the vineyard itself during cocktail hour and dinner. It was a complex, aromatic, easy to drink wine.
A memorable night led to us contacting Nella Terra to buy multiple cases of wine. From Christmas gifts to a Zoom wine tasting last month this wine has been a crowd-pleaser. Nella Terra’s service is impeccable. From the moment we placed our order to the quick delivery and beautiful packaging this is an amazing business!</review>< Pictures>

<text>It has been a year since my husband and I flew from Texas to California for Ty and Whitney’s wedding and I wanted to post this here in honor of their anniversary. When we were dropped off at the venue, we had a lovely walk through the vineyard to the wedding location. The views of the countryside, the vineyard, the wedding site and the reception tent were stunning.  We were surrounded by beauty. We were able to socialize with a glass of wine under the pergola before the start of the ceremony which was such a lovely concept. Then, we were seated for the wedding in the sunny open air that only California can deliver. After the ceremony, we enjoyed several appetizer stations placed throughout the area where chefs were preparing their specialty on site. You also had time to stroll around the grounds and take in all its’ beauty. Entering the reception tent was truly magical. The table décor, flowers, and personal place settings were exquisite and the attention to detail was impeccable. The wedding at Nella Terra was absolutely the most beautiful wedding I have ever attended, and it is a memory I will treasure forever.</text>< Gmap_id>

<name>Emily Holland<//name><Review>This review is for a wine tasting event at Nella Terra for a wedding celebration hosted in October 2020.

I can't say enough great things about Nella Terra Cellars. The venue is an oasis hidden in the Sunol rolling hills with a beautiful garden, mini waterfalls, fountains, romantic lighting, delicious wine and tented area with gorgeous lighting!

Finding a wedding venue in the midst of a pandemic was chaotic and once I contacted Nella Terra, Whitney made the whole thing possible with only 3 weeks ahead of time!

My guests couldn't stop talking about how incredibly beautiful and romantic the wedding venue was. The farm tables, chairs, tent, and lighting was all included. There's a bocce ball area and guests were allowed to peruse in the garden to their liking. The bartender was incredibly attentive and service was outstanding. The lighted archway and vineyard were one of our best photo ops and it's all complete with Nella Terra's venue!

If you're like me and trying to figure out how to celebrate your wedding safely in 2020, contact Nella Terra. They can make your dream come true and make it safe for guests!

Oh and the SUNSET photos.. the sunset photos are to die for because of the rolling golden hills!

Ya, don't even question it. Book Nella Terra for your venue!!!</Review>< userid>

<rating>1<//rating><review>I went to my friend's outdoor wedding at Nella Terra last year, and it was so INSANELY windy that you couldn't hear a thing.  The tent for the reception was blowing like crazy, and by the time we finished walking from the ceremony to the tent, my hair, which was curled, turned into a frizzy, blown-out mess.  The food and wine were meh.

I feel for the bride because she poured her heart into meticulously planning her wedding for almost a year, and it didn't turn out like she had hoped.  They deserved better than they got.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Nella Terra is such a well rounded establishment. I have been to a handful of tastings, the accommodating and knowledgable staff really make you feel right at home. Due to current events, they are even doing curb side pickup. It was actually really nice to get out of the house for a bit, take in the awesome views and pick-up some good wine.

I have also attended a few larger events . A summer wedding which made you feel like you were in a fairy-tale. The grounds by itself are so stunning, really doesn't need much extra but the tasteful decor really put everything over the top. My family attended their mother's day brunch last year. There was live music, the food was fantastic, the kids loved running around the bocce ball courts. Definitely one of the most breath taking event spaces I've been to. I can't wait for my next visit!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My husband and I cannot say enough great things about Nella Terra Cellars. Our wedding last year was everything we could have asked for.

I knew I love the venue from the pictures online, but from the minute we arrived to tour we were sold on the team and their level of service. They absolutely know what they’re doing and it really seemed like they were genuinely excited about our wedding day.

They always say to expect the unexpected, and thats exactly what happened during our reception when a wildfire broke out on the hillside near us. If it weren’t for the announcement, I’m not sure I would have even noticed. The team made sure everything still ran smoothly even though we were “sheltering in place.”

Almost a year later, we still have guest tell us how amazing the night was. The setting itself was unbelievable and we’re so happy we made the choice to get married at Nella Terra!< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Nella Terra is one of the reasons why our wedding was so perfect. The venue itself is the most beautiful little oasis with so many different gorgeous areas for photos. Take your pick from the golden hills, lush green vines, ponds, etc. The landscaping of the venue is great. Our photos turned out amazing, especially sunset photos taken on the hills. There is a beautiful long staircase that the bride is able to make her grand entrance from for the ceremony, which makes you feel like Cinderella entering the ball. There is also a great place to set up for cocktails right outside the reception tent area, which makes the transition from cocktails to reception seamless. We also were able to have a cornhole game set up and a firepit lounge area to keep guests entertained during cocktails, giving you plenty of time to take photos uninterrupted. This venue has something for everyone. Not only is this a beautiful setting for your special day, the staff is extra attentive. We had champagne in the cutest country-style bridal suite, and the boys had their own area to hang out in prior to the ceremony. Whitney from Nella Terra went above and beyond to assist us with any questions we had during our planning process, and we were even surprised at the end of the reception with our names projected onto the hills, which was so special. We were so lucky to have found Nella Terra, and if we could go back and do it all over again, we would choose Nella Terra in a heartbeat.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808fc3ff763523cb:0xbd3314d79738a6f5</gmap_id></record>

Shame on Nella Terra. If COVID doesn't put this business under, Karma will.

My family was supposed to have a weekend wedding at Nella Terra in June 2020. They've not only refused us a weekend wedding in June 2021 for the same price, but they had the audacity to ask for another $9k+ to have the weekend wedding we already paid for.</Text>< UserId.>

We hosted our small company event @ Nella Terra this past weekend, to appreciate our team who worked so hard during COVID.  Nella Terra is a place hidden in the hills with astonishing vineyards, gorgeous wedding site, personal and cozy wine tasting patios, beautiful gardens, and sunset views.

We were so fortunate to find this place during this time.  It was a perfect outdoor social distancing event.  This place is so relaxing and beautiful and helped all of us to reset, and to refresh.  It's such a a great retreat!

Griffin and his team superseded our expectations.  Due to current spacing and safety regulations, Griffin went out of his way to accommodate our requests.  He set up beautiful two seat tables of each couple, to allow proper social distancing, provided individual packed delicious charcuterie box options, extra tables for kids to play games, and fish food for the kids to feed the fish in the pond by the waterfall.

We tasted 5 flights of wine and enjoyed all of them!  Our guests felt so safe and comfortable within their own outdoor wine barrel setups and picnic tables.  Surrounding by the tranquil sceneries, great wines and the hospitality of the owners, we all felt so honored, and gracious of this family run vineyard.

We loved walking around the vineyards and enjoying the delicate designs of the pond, the garden, bocce ball courts, the small casita, and the fragrance of the nature.  Besides wine tasting, picture takings was one of our favorites.  Nella Terra is a beautiful backdrop.

Thank you Nella Terra for hosting our event, and for helping us to reset, to relax and to rejuvenate!  We are looking forward to more events at your winery next year.</Review>

Nella Terra (NT) turned out to be an absolute blessing for me and my now husband for our October 18th, 2020 wedding.  From the first time we toured the venue with Sharde, to the whole planning process with Whitney, the coordinator Lindsay (Simply Lovely Events, SLE), and the catering manager Jill (On the Vine, OTV) was hands down a pleasure and a relieving experience during this challenging year.  We had already toured a few other venues in the Bay Area beforehand, but I was in awe of Nella Terra’s beauty. When Sharde showed us details such as the bridal cottage, the ceremony area, cocktail patio area, the pond, bridge, waterfall, trail of beautiful trees and secluded hillside, and of course the gorgeous tent for our reception, I and my husband fell in love with it right away.  This is a venue with many beautiful and stunning picture opportunities as one of my guests mentioned to us, an “instagrammer’s dream!”.  Many of my guests had so much fun exploring around the venue and taking great pictures.
When working with Whitney in planning our wedding, at first we were not sure if our wedding could even happen, but she was kind, supportive, understanding and had kept communication with the county on up-to-date COVID health regulations and kept us informed of our options as more information became available.   This helped us tremendously in making our decisions.  The available options that she provided us, whether it was to keep our original date or to postpone to a later date, were all very reasonable and accommodating when we compared it to what other venues were offering our friends and relatives for their weddings during these challenging times.  The whole team including Whitney (NT), Lindsay (SLE), Jill (OTV) as well as the DJ Rob (Ace) were all very understanding, supportive, and most of all flexible in working with us to quickly adjust to the many changes due to COVID.
We chose to stick with our original date with a reduced headcount.  Whitney was kind enough to let us use the venue space to have our rehearsal lunch because it is almost impossible to find a restaurant to accommodate large parties with the County COVID health regulations. We ended up with a nice, socially distanced picnic with OTV providing our lunch.
Our wedding day went very smoothly and was very romantic and intimate.  The whole team’s attention to detail, communication and collaboration with each other, professionalism, and most of all their passion made my wedding day a perfect and unforgettable experience.   Thank you Whitney and Nella Terra, we are so grateful to have chosen to have our wonderful wedding at your beautiful venue.<//text>

<Review>Nella Terra was a dream come true! If you're looking for the perfect location for an unforgettable wedding... look no further! My husband (boyfriend at the time), family, and I were actually just wine tasting at Nella Terra for the day when my husband said... "I don't know about you... but I am getting married here!" We were not even engaged yet (haha), that is how in love we were with not only each other, but the location as well! That same day- I contacted Nella Terra and got a wedding date on the calendar for a year later. Everything ran smoothly leading up to the wedding. The wedding coordinators do everything in their power to make the bride and groom's dreams a reality. The actual wedding day was perfection. I run high on anxiety but my worries melted away with the care and effort from the NT staff. The bridal cottage was everything... walking down the long elegant stairs made me feel like an absolute princess... the atmosphere was magical. Since our wedding- we have received countless comments from wedding guests commenting that it was the most beautiful wedding they have ever been to. I have dreamed of my wedding my whole life- and it was better than I could have imagined.

PS. We named our dog 'Nella,' after Nella Terra so if that doesn't tell you how AMAZING it is- I'm not sure what does.</Review><Date>1593554937471<//Date>< Pics>

When my husband and I started our wedding venue shopping, we were looking for a venue that represented California, had the capacity of being able to accommodate our large wedding party/guests, and full of natural beauty. We quickly learned that Nella Terra hit all these points for us, and so many more.

First off, Nella Terra is an absolute diamond of a wedding venue and offers the whole package. It is truly a hidden gem, nestled in the rolling golden CA hills (which was a must have on my husband’s list). The grounds are absolutely stunning, and truly picturesque, there are so many beautiful photography spots. We loved how the ceremony site was only a few steps away from the reception area, and the gazebo for cocktail hour is a great place for all your guests to enjoy a glass of wine or beer before the reception starts! As the bride, one of my favorite things about Nella Terra is the grand cascading staircase. It makes for the perfect entrance to the beginning of such a breathtaking and magical wedding day. I continue to cherish that moment walking down the staircase, taking the whole venue in and seeing all our wedding plans come to life.

A few other items that we would like to mention:
The benefit of having the option for “indoor” and outdoor. Having the large tent for the reception could be used for the ceremony if weather doesn’t cooperate. Even though the venue is quite large, having a smaller more intimate wedding, particularly during social distancing times would be absolutely beautiful and would still be able to provide you with the same beautiful and magical wedding day experience that you are dreaming of. There is TONS of parking for all your guests.  The bridal cottage is so cute, and a fun place for the bride and all her gals to hangout in before the big moment!

The Catering company that Nella Terra uses is stellar! Loved working with On the Vine catering. From the moment of signing our wedding contract with Nella Terra, to the tasting and then having our menu come to life on our wedding day was flawless! We had so many complements from our guests! We really liked that you could do a dual entrée, so guests could have a plated dinner and receive both salmon and steak. We liked that the decision for a catering company was already decided for us, takes the headache out of researching and booking a company. We thoroughly loved the food and would highly recommend!

We cannot say enough about the Nella Terra Staff; very professional, responsive, and accommodating to certain questions and requests my husband and I had. We loved that Nella Terra made us feel like family and there were so many personal touches that made us feel special. Thank you to Whitney, Kendall, and Sharde for all their hard work that helped make our day super special and flawless and all other Nella Terra staff working behind the scenes.

This review wouldn’t be complete without mentioning their wine. Absolutely delicious, and there are many varieties to choose from! We are big pinot noir fans, and their wine does not disappoint!  We are proud Nella terra wine club members and look forward to swinging by the winery to pick up our quarterly shipments, it is a way for us to enjoy the grounds and the beauty that Nella Terra offers.  Not to mention reliving our wedding day each time we pick up our wine shipment.

So, you must add Nella Terra to your list of venues to visit, and if you are like us, will quickly realize it is a one of a kind wedding venue!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Unfortunately I won’t be able to write a review about how great this location is or could be. I reached out for some information for my wedding and casually said 75 people. And their response was “after looking at your information, we don’t feel this venue is a good fit for your needs.” This Kendall girl is telling ME what my needs are? How do you not know if my guest count is larger or could be etc. either way, such a turn off! I work in the wedding catering business and want to make sure everyone knows the service you’ll get from Nella Terra Cellars.<//Text>< rating>

A beautiful hidden oasis tucked in the rolling hills of Sunol. I have had the pleasure of visiting Nella Terra’s tasting room, attending events hosted at the property and as a wedding florist I have also worked with their amazing team for weddings/events.

Tasting room - the tasting room staff here are so knowledgeable and kind, and the wine is excellent! I especially love their Viognier. The family that owns and runs Nella Terra are often out mingling in the tasting room, which is so fun! I love bringing my family and friends up to enjoy the views and the delicious offerings when they are visiting from out of town. Pack a picnic and stop by to enjoy their wines - you will not be disappointed!

Events - first off, what a beautiful venue! It really is a rare gem in this area. Upon entering this venue you feel like you are so far away from the hustle of the near by cities, yet you are close enough to the freeway to make this venue completely accessible. From a wedding guests stand point - the venue team made sure everything went off seamlessly and my experience was 10/10. The ceremony and reception areas are separated but very close together, which eliminates the dreaded traveling in heels across long distances to get from place to place. You’ll find yourself surrounded by rolling hulls, big trees, flowering plants and so many vines!
It is a unique, clean, beautiful property.

Working - I have had the pleasure of working wedding/events with the Nella Terra Staff. They really goes above and beyond for their clients/couples and it shows. I have seen the “behind-the-scene” piece of what goes into a wedding/event many times and the staff here will do everything they can to make sure their clients are happy. The team of people here are so kind and hard working!

Overall this is a wonderful family owned and operated business in adorable Sunol. I highly recommend for a relaxing, laid-back wine tasting experience and for events of all kinds. Check them out, you will be blown away!< /Text>

<gmapID>0x808fc3ff763523cb:0xbd3314d79738a6f5</gmapID><Text>I'm writing as a very disappointed groom-to-be, and feel compelled to warn any couples from booking their wedding with Nella Terra. While we were impressed with the physical venue, we are livid with how Nella Terra and their required wedding coordinator, Simply Lovely, are treating couples impacted by COVID19. In this environment their business practices are downright shameful.

For some background, we paid a significant premium to have our wedding scheduled for a Saturday evening in early June. Due to the 'shelter in place' order, we've been completely unable to continue planning our wedding, as all the contractors and businesses we need to work with, in addition to Nella Terra, are closed. So those businesses providing our tuxes and scheduled fittings, my fiancé's and bridesmaids wedding dresses, caterers, entertainment etc. are all strictly shut down.

To make things worse, Nella Terra has been a nightmare to work with throughout this ordeal. Initially, they downplayed the seriousness of the crisis and ignored our concerns stating there would be no problem having the wedding in early June. As the crisis worsened and California instituted a lockdown, they seemed to better understand the severity of the crisis. Now with an early June wedding an impossibility, they are unwilling to reschedule us for the equivalent of what we have contracted for, which is a Summer Saturday wedding.

Our contract clearly states that in the event of an Act of God, Nella Terra will reschedule pending availability at no penalty. Since their Saturday schedule is booked thru Thanksgiving 2020, while it is not ideal, a postponement of our wedding another year to the Summer of 2021 would be a solution to at least consider. We requested to move our rescheduled wedding date to one of the many Saturdays they have open in Summer 2021, and were completely denied any of those open dates. They informed us this would be a loss of future revenue to them.

The owners' correspondence has been quite callous, adding insult to our complete disappointment. Due to their lack of willingness to provide us what we contracted for, we requested a refund. The owners literally scoffed at us while refusing to even listen to our situation. They were quick to enforce the part of the contract that states there will be no refunds, but refuse to honor the part that states we can reschedule pending availability with no penalty.

We paid for a Saturday Summer wedding and it's important to us to have something similar, as most of our guests are traveling from out of state. Nella Terra has repeatedly refused to allow us to reschedule for a Saturday that is open on their current calendar, instead only offering us Monday through Thursday options in 2021. We would never have contracted with them for a weekday wedding.  They also refuse to refund the difference in price from a premium weekend to weekday. Their reasoning is those weekend dates are reserved for new clients only, because they need to think about the health of their business and prices are increasing in 2021. If we want to move our date to a Saturday next summer, we would have to forfeit all current payments (~$24K) and then pay the increased 2021 price. How is this not profiteering and/or extortion?

It's clear to us Nella Terra is only concerned with making sure they don't miss a single cent of revenue opportunity, while cheating their current clients out of what they've paid for. We feel held hostage given we've paid almost the entire sum for the wedding. My fiancé is understandably devastated, given how much she's put into planning this wedding for over a year now. To be taken advantage by a business trying to profit off a world health crisis has us at a loss for words. The owners at Nella Terra should be ashamed of themselves.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< rating>

A Hidden Gem in Sunol!  We had such an amazing experience at Nella Terra Cellars in 2018, we decided to return again in 2019 for our annual event.  Numerous upgrades had been made to the already immaculate and stunning landscape.  Our guests were amazed as they entered the majestic tent and found ample room for a dance floor, DJ, fun and games and silent auction items.   Kendall, our event coordinator, anticipated our needs and the scheduled events throughout the evening ran seamlessly.  On the Vine Catering was very professional and served the most amazing fare - our guests are still raving about the elevated macaroni and cheese bar!   It was definitely an evening to remember - Thank you Nella Terra!!< /Review>

<time>1458169306894<//time><rate>4</rate><review>This review is from the viewpoint of a wedding attendee. Last weekend I had the honor of attending a beautiful wedding at this picturesque location.

Not the easiest place to find, but there are marked signs here and there. Note that there are NO street lights at night. Be careful of nice shoes as parking lot isn't paved. After walking what seems like endless # of steps to get to the seating area, it was worth it. The alter sits in front of a pond-like setting with a small bridge. Since it was a hot day, cold lemonade and ice water await in the back.

Cocktail hour and reception were held in the court yard and in a big open tent. Light breeze flowed through with some shade here and there outside. Cheerful staff members passed around light appetizers. I enjoyed the cucumber salmon bites and the crispy triangles. The hosts included an open bar so of course I had to try the wine.

Staff was well trained and dinner was brought out simultaneously for the 150 guests. Options included salmon, duck, steak, or vegetarian, which was pre-selected when I RSVP'ed. I forgot that I had gotten the duck that I felt was too salty. However, I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes because it was seasoned well, light and fluffy. I had a bite of the salmon and vegetarian dish, both were better than the duck in my opinion. No real kitchen on site, everything was prepped in a trailer?

FYI: No real restrooms on site. The restroom is an upscale potty in a trailer. Lots of air fresheners and vents inside, so smells were masked. Ladies, be careful walking up the metal steps because there are small holes on the metal that might get your heel stuck.

The night ended with lots of photo-booth action and dancing. The hosts hired a live band and the acoustics in the tent was just right. Night time became chilly, but dancing kept me warm. Overall, I would consider having a wedding here.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It really comes alive at dusk. Beautiful views of surrounding hills make this place a romantic wedding venue.<//text>

I will never take my son anywhere else!! Perfect haircuts every time! My son is very picky and knows what he likes ....it’s hard for us to find a place that can give him what he wants every single time. Brian is always willing to be patient with him and gives him a fresh cut every time. He’s great with kids...he’s a veteran ... and he knows how to cut. I recommend you check him out!!! Great guy with great artistry!!< /text>

Rico and his staff do an amazing job. Love the man cave feeling when you walk through the door, what a cool place! I've been to many barbers over the years and have to say Rico by far is top notch! His professionalism and attention to detail is the reason I would recommend this place. Well done Rico!< /text>

You know, the first time I took my 12 year old son here we loved it.  They were very busy, but everyone was happy and very friendly.  The second time, same thing - we loved it.  The third time - it seemed like everyone in the place gave us a dirty look when we walked in and the whole time we were there.  The guy that did my son's hair spent more time talking to his buddies in the shop and on the cell phone than he did fixing my son's hair.  Was not friendly at all.  Weird!  I didn't mind paying a little extra for this barber shop because of the friendliness, and great hair cuts, etc., but this last time totally soured our experience and we won't be back.  Sorry Rico!  You have a great shop - not sure what happened.  :-(<//Text>

Here at Rico's the service is great and the barbers put forth the effort to give you quality work, not to mention the lady's definitely do their thing here as well. I do and will continue to recommend this barbershop to everyone looking for a fresh professional cut.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Where do I start? For one they are way over priced, $20 bucks for a hair cut? And I've tried most of the barbers that go there and I'd say 6 out of 10 dont know how to cut hair. Also when you walk in there you have everyone staring at you and looking at you all funny. I rather go to the chines salon across the road, it's the same quality anyways.< /Review>

Went in to get a haircut about a week ago. Spent $40 on it. He messed up BAD I had to wear a hat. A simple comb over fade with a line is all I asked for. He screwed up the line by cutting it at least an inch thick when I asked for a small one. He also made the line super uneven. It was the bald dude in the back. He made my hair uneven in places they shouldn't be. Left too much on the top and too much on the sides. Cut my head when he did my line. He nicked a few times with his clippers and didn't even notify me. I found out myslef by feeling the blood on my head after i got in to the car. WORST haircut I have literally ever had. This dude that did my hair was the WORST! I do NOT reccomend this place.<//text>

<Text>Worst customer service received from ""Elizabeth" as she claimed her name to be. No name tag for proof. She was sarcastic, rude with a very cold attitude. She charged me with the original price of my products when i reminded her the products were 30% off. I had to go back to the store for price correction.  Instead of apologizing, "Elizabeth" blamed me for her mistake because "i gave her the wrong price."  I let her know i am writing a poor review online... she mockingly responded with thank you.   If i could rate zero vs one,  i would. I  will NEVER go back to this store.

The store owner or manager could care less.
No single apology for any  of the negative reviews.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I went back to ash blonde from red 😂😂😂 AGAIN :)
So i needed tons of product for the operations :) I like the store and options...very cheap :)) DO NOT  blame the Sally girls about knowledge. You need know what product good for your hair / skin...etc You are the one need a beauty knowledge before you entering salon works hair/beauty supplies store! Who will take a chance to say ohh 20 volume will be good for your hair than next day you will enter the store without hair and sue the company for it... Please read and learn before you destroy your hair ...<//Review>

Customer service was not good, workers had no name tags to know whom you're communicating with  also felt extra watched due to the color of my skin, over all l've had better encounter @ that location with other staff members but not these two</Text>

They're doing very poor job during Covid-19. They ask you for all credit card's information. Is it safe or rational to give someone all information? I'm not happy and comfortable to do that. They are saying there's no exchange but they already exchange the items. We are buying from the other stores during this time, but they do not have poor and non make sense service as this.</review>

If I could give a 0 I would. The girls in there have absolutely zero manners and did not give one s**t about helping me. They were chewing their gum like cows just sitting there watching me struggle to find what I was looking for. Made me feel super uncomfortable.</text>

<review>I would never come to this locations again. I watched as a customer walked in and asked the employee where an item was, the employee told her that wasn't what she was looking for, even though the lady stated her hair dresser told her to get said specific item, then the employee told her "this isn't a short answer, I'll be right back.". Walked away and the customer of course walked out from the store.
THEN I pay for all my items, spending between $50-$100, forgetting about my insider card, and let's mention that I wasn't asked if I had one either. I ask the manager behind the counter,  who mind you was the person who rang me up,  if she could look up my card for the insider discounts. She takes my receipt,  looks at it and says "oh actually you are going to be charged more because I pressed the wrong button and gave you a school discount."
Mind you I'm standing there with my baby in my arms who is agitated. I had to stand there for an extra 10 mins or more while this woman returned all the items, MANUALLY PUTTING IN ALL THE ITEM INFO, then have everything charged again, for her to charge me an extra few dollars. Now call me stupid, but considering her mistake,  she should not have made me stand there with my baby fussing while she fixed her mistake! Besides if I didn't even mention the insider card I would have been out of the store and she would have had to have dealt with her mistake accordingly. I'm not looking for a few dollar discount at all, I'm frustrated about the lack of common customer courtesy. Again, I will never come back to this location.< /review>< pictures>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>The employees aren't helpful and they have attitude.  I can go on about what happened but that's not the point. They should be glad to check for products in the back and should be more helpful instead just pointing me in a direction then walking away. Don't work there if you don't want be helpful and share your knowledge. Leave the attitude at the door otherwise you're going to get bad reviews for a company you're representing.</Text>< pics>

"Are you going to buy that?"

ANSWER: Do your tester bottles have issues like you because they sure look like it

Thanks but NO THANKS. I'll take my hundreds of dollars to another store who understands the bigger picture.

Merry Christmas!</Review>< Pics>

Not even worth a star. I went it to buy hair toner. & I asked Jackie the gal working there which volume is better 10 or 20. & she replied with well if you check the box it says 20. OK I'm going into your store to ask for help not to get bitched at or made to feel dumb. I will be calling corporate and I will never shop at this Sally's again. And mind you I spent 50 bucks.</review>

Chronically understaffed, but they have always been helpful. Fairly standard Sally Beauty experience here. Lots of easy parking :)</text>

One of the best pedicures I have ever received!  I am so happy I was able to find a place in the area to start getting my pedicures!  The owners are so sweet and really took their time in everything they did!  So happy to say I will be a returning customer!</Review>

This place is legit ❣️. Kim & Nina are so sweet, nice & kind.  They both really take their time to do  great & very thorough work.  I enjoyed getting both a fill & a pedicure $35 each, very reasonable!  The massage includes a scrub in scent of your choice, about half a dozen to choose from.  Exceptional 💓❣️  Then, a mud mask, followed by a hot stone massage..... heavenly 🥰. It is a very relaxing place to have a luxury treatment & experience, love my nails too💓.  Highly recommend ❣️< /text>

Nina does terrific work and I try to get a pedicure every 4 - 5 weeks to avoid foot & nail problems.  When I have time I get a manicure too, just for grins.  Best I have ever encountered. Fun, safe and right by a great Mexican rest.</Text>

Kim and Nina always give the best pedicure. I have been to many salons and this is by far the best. Love the lemon and the cucumber treatments.  My wife and I are now regulars.<//Review>

Happy to find a new go-to place for my Pedi!  Co-owners Kim and Nina will take good care of you. Very friendly and attentive. This place was taken over recently by these women partnership. They updated the place. They have Wi-Fi and take drop-ins. Lots of parking and easy access from Bell Road.  New ownership as of August 2018 so any reviews before that were for prior ownership.   Give them a try!

They do waxing as well. I found them super nice, accommodating and enthusiastic.  Will definitely come back!!

Update: my 2nd visit > still excellent service and job by Kim. Happy Feet = happy me☺️< /Review>

I took my 2 grandkids in to get a gel manicure. Most sloppy job I have ever seen! She said it would take 1 hour to do. She was done with both girls in less than 30 minutes. What a rip off.  The only thing she did was file their nails and  sloppily polished them. I give this place a 0.<//Text>

I have been going to the salon for over 7 years, Lee was the best.  Very caring, always felt you were important to him,and always did a great.  Lee is no longer  working at or running the shop,"man" what a difference .  The first time I had a fill I was not  happy very thick, and I could not get BEBE to shape them the way I wanted them.  I decided maybe it was a bad day, and would give another try.  It was a mistake.  I am looking for an other salon, along with 5 of my friends who were loyal customers of Lee's, but also are very unhappy.  Very fast but extremely sloppy,.  I question if they are following sanitation guidelines.  I am fight nail fungus now.    We really miss Lee. Just wish I knew how he is doing.</Text>

One of the best pedicures I have ever received!  I am so happy I was able to find a place in the area to start getting my pedicures!  The owners are so sweet and really took their time in everything they did!  So happy to say I will be a returning customer!</Review>

<review>This place is legit ❣️. Kim & Nina are so sweet, nice & kind.  They both really take their time to do  great & very thorough work.  I enjoyed getting both a fill & a pedicure $35 each, very reasonable!  The massage includes a scrub in scent of your choice, about half a dozen to choose from.  Exceptional 💓❣️  Then, a mud mask, followed by a hot stone massage..... heavenly 🥰. It is a very relaxing place to have a luxury treatment & experience, love my nails too💓.  Highly recommend ❣️< /review>< Pics>

Nina does terrific work and I try to get a pedicure every 4 - 5 weeks to avoid foot & nail problems.  When I have time I get a manicure too, just for grins.  Best I have ever encountered. Fun, safe and right by a great Mexican rest.< /review>

Kim and Nina always give the best pedicure. I have been to many salons and this is by far the best. Love the lemon and the cucumber treatments.  My wife and I are now regulars.</text>

Happy to find a new go-to place for my Pedi!  Co-owners Kim and Nina will take good care of you. Very friendly and attentive. This place was taken over recently by these women partnership. They updated the place. They have Wi-Fi and take drop-ins. Lots of parking and easy access from Bell Road.  New ownership as of August 2018 so any reviews before that were for prior ownership.   Give them a try!

They do waxing as well. I found them super nice, accommodating and enthusiastic.  Will definitely come back!!

Update: my 2nd visit > still excellent service and job by Kim. Happy Feet = happy me☺️<//text>

I took my 2 grandkids in to get a gel manicure. Most sloppy job I have ever seen! She said it would take 1 hour to do. She was done with both girls in less than 30 minutes. What a rip off.  The only thing she did was file their nails and  sloppily polished them. I give this place a 0.<//Text>

I have been going to the salon for over 7 years, Lee was the best.  Very caring, always felt you were important to him,and always did a great.  Lee is no longer  working at or running the shop,"man" what a difference .  The first time I had a fill I was not  happy very thick, and I could not get BEBE to shape them the way I wanted them.  I decided maybe it was a bad day, and would give another try.  It was a mistake.  I am looking for an other salon, along with 5 of my friends who were loyal customers of Lee's, but also are very unhappy.  Very fast but extremely sloppy,.  I question if they are following sanitation guidelines.  I am fight nail fungus now.    We really miss Lee. Just wish I knew how he is doing.</Text>

Between my wife and I we have purchased several items between the SF and NYC Goyard locations.

Service has always been hospitable and kind. They receive a lot of emails / requests so service and communication can sometimes be a bit delayed, but beyond that we have both been happy. In addition, with minor upkeep, the product looks amazing for years and will last a lifetime.</text>

You need an appointment to get in. Email them and they will contact you for the time and date you wanted to visit. I was treated splendidly. Jay’s expertise will assist you on choosing the right item you are trying to purchase. I was well received.</Text>

If you’re expecting an “Ultra Exclusive” personalized customer service, you won’t get it from this specific store and its sales associates.
Very incompetent and rude sales associates which have no idea about the customer services.
Now I understand why this store has 3+ rating!!!!< /review>

<review>Wow I can't believe people are giving these guys such a hard time. This is an ultra-exclusive brand and the boutique is beautiful. Capturing the Ambiance of Paris where this company hails from. Their products are iconic and in my humble opinion light years ahead of what is on offer from their contemporary Louis Vuitton. There are no photos allowed inside the shop but what you will find are the world's top canvas and leather travel accessories. If you are in San Francisco and you like luxury goods this is the place to visit.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpKcQaiauMjxGON1hf4FVHHy5caXCIikvnLzSv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHpWv8FF23C6tIW97A16enJr7ctc_gr1bDvzvg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXhHkFyR9P3HPgnSzzBnSeVjHEJshBo5cjLST2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHfhwT4v1zmHjEhqKfCnPvtfdL-gCWX70bZcqq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdXAQgjwudOX_k7AIYF7ZIhnCWO4gfdK--Q1GD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMk_GMERp7Bvwe2hn7vYPC6b4MH5N2Nbrh6rOhr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhJXsCYntctKauDRe5jYHTbdCvOJyUe2wmRFlg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTxER6fNRCkCf-U0CuOp4bVzimk7pjBv6vdq3a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM87bddRfAlKMyvopM5W0Kep-_Nl0-9OcLWSiSe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Customer services could be better. If you purchase an item and have it monogram be sure to follow up on your own because they won't tell you when the order is ready for pick up. I love the leather goods but customer service could be better! However, if you are ok with average or below average then it's all good!!<//text>< response>

I really enjoyed shopping here. Jay was so nice and friendly. He will assist you with full kindness. They had the items I wanted to buy so you won't have any difficulties to purchase. I recommend this Maison de Goyard!<//Review>

<Review>My wife sent Goyard SF an email because they don't allow people to get in without an appointment in advance. We received an email from them, and they asked us to call to make an appointment for our visit. We called several times, and they say they will reach us back in 15 minutes. They didn't, so we called again, and they promised to call back, but it never happened. Do the Goyard SF employees think they're kind of luxurious people to ignore customers who eagerly want to buy their products because they work there? That's ridiculous. Never say 'Bonjour!' when you receive the customer's phone call; you guys make my day terrible.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Updated on 12/3/2020:
Still 5-star. I just happened to pass by on Black Friday and saw the store was opened. The security man was super nice. It was slow so I got in right away. I was just going to say “hi” to Venus and check out the sizes of the Artois. She was not working that day. Jay was available and helped me. I told him I was not planning on buying and he was still very nice and helpful. As I was leaving, the Hardy caught me eyes and I ended up buying it.
The store is small. But the service was very personal, no rush, no attitude, no pressure to buy.

Original post on 8/9/2020:
I had a very good experience with my first Goyard purchase from the San Francisco boutique. Due to Covid-19, everything was done via email, phone and FaceTime. The process was quick and smooth. I was able to do curb side pickup on the same day. I was assisted by Venus, who was responsive, delightful and helpful.

The Belvedere 2 PM is very gorgeous in person. The quality and craftsmanship are impressive. I am looking forward to visit the boutique when it is opened again.<//review>< Pics>

It is very hard to believe the one star reviews after I had a wonderful experience in the boutique the other day. When we tried entering the store the doorman/ security came to us with a smile and asked us to please wait outside while they were helping other customers. We then waited about 5 minutes then he gave us the green light to go in. The store was very small but showcases all of their wonderful products.
And a sales associate was with us IMMEDIATELY! She was very helpful and knew what she was talking about. This store is great!</review>

I was a little intimidated to go inside the store at first because Im with my  hubby and 2 kids and I read on the reviews that they don’t allow kids inside. But luckily, there’s no line and no other customers inside the store, so the security guard let us all in. Venus, the sales associate greeted us immediately and was very accomodating. There are a lot of items to choose from but since I new what I wanted before coming to the store, the transaction was fast and smooth.

I've purchased here prior, and never had any issues but recently an older Asian woman working there was incredibly stand-off ish and rudely said no photos when I tried taking a photo of an item to send to someone as it was a gift. She ruined my experience here and was incredibly rude the whole time I tried purchasing an item.< /review></record>

Excellent shopping experience, about a ten minute wait outside for an available sales person. Julie ended up helping me, very pleasant smile, attitude and highly knowledgable. Line or no line this place is worth checking out if you want something special for your collection. I'll go ahead and answer the price question. Yes, it is more expensive than most other stores but you get your own sales person! I can't stress how nice that feels after being herded around all the other high end stores.</Review>

It is very nice.  They give you 1 on 1 attention.  I am a bit concerned about the material they use since I like sturdy bags that I can shove under or over seats on planes & such, & that is in Polaris class.  I like leather bags, but I am not sure they offer that for a man's daily carryall bag.  I will continue to consider this brand, but I cannot buy a man bag that seems like it's made out of paper mache (no offense meant).  The very nice man educated me well today in their SF store.  I will be in Paris in November, 2019 & will view their offerings at that time.  I visited their Paris store, but I had no luck.  I had great luck at Louis Vuitton across the street.  I went back to this San Francisco store a couple times & then on 1/29/21.  No new men's items.  Sigh.</text>

I recently purchased a few Goyard items from Chicago boutique.  The staff there was very kind and helpful.  They were able to locate the items to purchase.

Unfortunately, my issue was not completely resolved (through no fault of the Chicago store or staff).  My issue was I had purchased a wallet and had it personalized.  I was assured it would be done by the best professionals at the SF store without error and understood they were hand painted.  It was a simple inital monogram, nothing custom.

When the item had to returned to my store for pick up; the workmanship was poor.  I believe the paint work was done at the San Francisco store according to the order and manager.

The letters are not properly aligned nor centered; the dot in between the initials appeared like a "birdie" from Badminton, and the shadowing area was disportionate to its size.  It was bigger than it should be.  This was confirmed in store as well as all the samples shown in store as well.  In addition to all this, there were paint spots and drips on the wallet from the sloppy workmanship.  I was shocked to see all this as I was assured these would be done with accuracy and level of professionalism I would expect from Goyard.

After going back and forth with artist at the SF store; they were not helpful and said they would not correct the misaligned and sloppy workmanship of the letters and dot; but only would consider just removing the paint drips they splatted on the wallet.  The wallet was sent out again back to the SF store.  When it came back, nearly 1.5 months later; the paint splats were removed, however it doing so, it faded some of the Goyardine pattern on the wallet.  It was brand new and never carried; however it already looks as if it were used from the fading.  From what I was told, I had no choice but to accept the flawed piece since there were no exchanges on personalized items; even though Goyard has made the errors.

For such a small piece, I am really concerned there were so many issues.  Their artists made the mistake and refused to correct it; instead doing the least amount of work possible and damaging the piece and only elected to semi-correct to remove the paint drips they put on there in the first place.  From this, I'm not sure I can recommend any customer to get their items personalized without being warned of the risks and consequences; even though this is trademark perk of Goyard.  I would have been even more upset if they ruined my bag as well.

This has been a very unfortunate experience and I am still surprised by the lack of attention to detail and committment to customer service that I would expect from Goyard.< /Text>

<text>First time in a Goyard Boutique and the first sales associate that helped me, Jay, was very nice, patient and a delight to talk to. He even told me to leave my number and called when the bag I wanted came in the next day. Came back on a Sunday but forgot to check their hours prior. So instead of opening the door and inform me in a well mannered way that the store is closed, the doorman and one of the SA opened a slit and told me that they are closed while looking at me like I was a hobo trying to come into their home for shelter lol. The doorman is really the opposite of what Goyard represents, classy, elegant, and historical. Maybe she would be better as a bouncer for some alleyway clubs. But, I like the brand and I’m glad I purchased my first piece from Jay. Even if all the other staffs are POSs, I’d still go for my homie Jay.<//text>< pictures>

Goyard has some pretty cool and supple leathers, specifically their Goyard line of natural hides in various shades. The staff, Marco in particular, were helpful and found me an original heirloom tote in a color that's off-beige but matches my shoes and accessories. There's also a huge leather couch you can chill on and have a latte (but don't spill it).</Text>

The security guard was so rude that I didn’t even go in. First he told me to wait in line but there was no line. The people who had been standing near the door, left right as I approached the “line.” I tried to explain this and he said I should have waited in line after them. BUT THEY HAD ALREADY LEFT! After I pointed that our he got defensive and told me I had to stand in line anyways because there was no sales associate to help me. That’s fine. I understand wanting to control traffic but come on. If this conversation had happened without him arguing I would have been understanding and waited. I don’t need to deal with a security guard on a power trip, to buy Goyard. This is why online retail exists.< /review>

As noted in other reviews, this boutique offers very poor customer service. Service is paramount in almost every business, but for a lauded, historic, and expansive brand, even more crucial. Giles was unpleasant, unhelpful, and arrogant, though the woman who originally assisted was ok.< /text>

I always receive good service here, even if I am not purchasing anything. I had put my name down for a specific product in the old, franchised store and they never called me.  I put my name down again when this store opened, and they called me as soon as the bag arrived.<//Text>

I can see why this Goyard location has such terrible reviews. I would give this place a 0 star if I could.

I was appalled by the treatment I got today when I was at their SF store that I had to write this review because it made me so upset. First off, the doorman was uncomfortably staring at me the whole time I was in the store, despite there being other customers in the store. Why don't you stare at them at all? I decided to call him out on it in front of everyone. I'm sorry that I could afford Goyard. Surprise.

Next, the sales associate Meagan that was helping me out was judgmental, unknowledgeable, and aloof. I don't purchase the brand Goyard, so I don't know much about the products, so I assumed the woman helping me would be knowledgable. My brother wanted a wallet from here for Christmas so I asked Meagan about the price range (lowest to highest) of the wallets. She stated that the price range was from around $500 - $1100. I had my brother on the phone describing the type of wallet he wanted, while I stated the description to Meagan. Meagan showed me only two types of wallet and then stated that one of them she recommended me matched my brother's description. Also, I should have known she was not thinking straight when she then asked me if I wanted sparkling or still water, and I said I wanted still water and she brought out sparkling.

Then Meagan took me to the back of the store where another unknowledgeable woman ringed me up. Before the woman scanned my credit card she stated that my total was 7K. 7K? How in the world did a wallet where the highest price range was $1100 become 7K! I guess I shouldn't say too much about this woman because due to her mistake of telling me the wallet I was about to purchase was 7K, that made me realize the wallet Meagan helped me with wasn't even what my brother wanted.

Next time, all you have to do is show the 3 different types of wallet, state the price range of the 3 types, and the difference between them and any customer can easily decide and confirm which wallet they want.

Who hired these associates to work at a luxury brand store? I will never come back.</review>

Doorman was beyond rude, wouldn't let us in although the store was not that crowded. Even though people were actually leaving, he still didn’t let us in! When asked how long will the wait be, he gave so much attitude and said "i will talk to you soon"! And shut the door in our faces!
Very disapointed in such service, i was there ready to purchase a bag, not sure now i wanna ever buy anything from them!< /Text>

Had a wonderful experience at Goyard San Francisco on 1/17/14. Andrea was extremely friendly and helpful, and to the contrary of some other reviews I've read, no one in the store snubbed me because of my jeans, sneakers, and t-shirt. I was greeted as soon as I walked in, and  when I explained what I wanted (a personalized grey St Louis bag) Andrea offered both sizes for me to try so I could decide which worked better for me, and even helped me choose the best colors for my personalization. Overall, a very pleasant experience, and I look forward to returning to Goyard on my next trip to San Francisco.

(FYI---to clear up a misconception that has been floated around for a long time, Goyard no longer hand-paints their bags, with the exception of any personalization done. Instead, a complex, multi-step color and paint application is used to create the slightly raised Goyard pattern.)</review>

The quality is exceptional. However, customer service is horrendous. I have several items and every time they just act like such a snobs! lol Not friendly or inviting! The products are the only thing that keeps me buying.< /Review>

Kind of disappointed they had no record of our past purchases at their prior SF location and turned me away the first time I came to the new store as they were too busy to see me then...</Text>

<text>Not much grass in the fairways where there's heavy traffic, but the greens were great, the scenery was cool. There's some really fun tee shots. I know it's conventional wisdom, but you never want to go long here. Most of the greens slope pretty severely from back to front. The short par 4s will eat your lunch if you're out of position. It was very fun to play and I'll be playing there again.< /text>< userid>

Lots of overall potential. Over priced.
Lacks leadership and vision.
Makes up policies that are non-existent and is hungry for money.
Antiquated mind-set which is why they are at where they are.<//review>

Pajaro is a forgiving course with wide fairways. The course has some long holes mixed with elevation changes. Greens play looked well maintained.< /Review>

Its a really fun track with some interesting holes. If it were in better shape on the fairways it would be a top dollar gem. The putting was awesome though!</review>

Nice putting green, though a little on the small side. There were five on the green. Felt crowded.

Driving range is cool. Makes you feel like you can do space launches.

The Cafe is almost "date" worthy. Great views of the fairway from its window tables. Morning sun may pose a problem.

Golfers may have their cars detailed while on the links. Way convenient.

Parking can be a bit iffy.<//Text>

<Review>This is an average course with above average green fees. $63 is way too much for what the course offers. I've stopped playing Pajaro. You  can find better courses and value at course to the north.</Review><user_name>m peterson< /user_name><GmapID>0x808e04c92b8a2e55:0x1ba46d7b37f85958<//GmapID>< Response>

The greens are better than ever, and in spite of drought in CA the fairways are good. The price is right (makes you come back since you spend less per day). Driving range allows you to hit from the grass, which is not common these days. Putting green is good. Additionally they have a Grill area that provides great bkfst items and traditional lunch. Beers and hard stuff available.</review>

Our golf club played a tournament here a couple of weeks ago; it was my first time at the course.  Interesting track.  Definitely walkable so I enjoyed that.  However, they were experiencing the aftermath of the winter rains and massive vegetation growth.  Their primary landscaping equipment had broken and they hadn't quite caught up with the grooming of the course but even with all the clumps of mown grass (minus one star), it was a fun experience.  The staff were all very pleasant and helpful.  Big shoutout to Mark Darby who came by after our round and chatted with us about the history and maintenance of the course.  I'm looking forward to playing again after they've caught up on the landscaping.<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><pics>None< /pics><review>one of my favorite local golf courses, unfortunately recently the last two times i have gone in the last month, they have let the rough get really long, like cow pasture long, i mean this is the kind of rough that the ball goes down and it disappears, last time i checked this was not going to be the site for the 2017 U.S. Open, not sure if its just sloppy mowing or the greenskeeper has fallen asleep at the wheel, this obviously does not promote fast play as you are constantly searching for your ball, greens are in fine shape.</review>< response>

The store is big. Wide range of assortment. But we where not to impressed by the staff here. Even in the middle of the day with plenty of associates. Maybe they noticed we where foreigners</text>

<Text>Bought a $50 gift card at Victoroa Secret Fashion  Valley mall San Diego! Mailed to niece in Virginia . When she went to use they told her couldn't use it because it had been used. WHEN IT NEVER DID!!! Strip on back of card still on.  Went to store they couldn't help. Had me call a  1800#.  I did and was given a runaround.  Then said was told sorry they are NOT responsible for lost or stolen cards. I did not lose it.  Somehow it was cloned. I Lost my $$ went on line read tons of review of people it's happened to  inside job of Fraud. Looking into getting class action Lawsuit. Getting signatures and people it's happened to.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>The mall at Horton Plaza is a ghost town. The VS store had quite a few customers.  I don't care for the dress code the associates have- very relaxed. Maybe that's what they are going for. The cabinets throughout the store are showing their age- chipped in places. Greeted after I've been in the store  30 minutes. Not enough help on the sales floor.  Had to hunt for the cash register.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>I should have written this review years ago as Kotaro and his shop are a joy to visit.  Not only do I make a point of visiting when needed, I frequently tell out of town visitors to make some time to just stroll through, talk to whomever is working and inevitably, they too attest to how perfect a visit it is.   I wish I could give 4 stars.<//review></record>

<Text>Staff are nice but one of them not being honest. Don't apply for the VC angel credit card unless you are okay with being placed a hard pull on your credit report. Staff were dishonest about this by saying that it's not actually a credit card and will not be reported to credit bureau. What a lie.<//Text><gmapID>0x80d954a7e5eef095:0x58393ff8eda40d75<//gmapID>< Resp>

<date>1451520486315< /date><Review>The worst Costumer service provided. Too long to explain so I will try to narrow it down...I told about 3 girls I need it help with finding a gift for a friend of mine and no one cared to help me. They would just point to where the things were and left. Bottom line is no one paid attention to my needs.

Another thing I called to ask how long parking was free for the first 3 hours but Like I said before no one seemed to give enough time or explanations to their costumers she never once mentioned free parking if u BUY SOMETHING. AND SINCE I DIDNT SHOP FOR ANYTHING I LEFT AND THEY TRIED TO CHARGE ME 6$ FOR PARKING. IT WAS EMBARRASSING I HAD TO WRITE THIS.< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

Everytime I go in this store the sales people are awesome. There's a 2certain girls that was awesome. Tylor and another girl I forgot her name. But they were extremely awesome. Tyler saw I wanted a certain bra and it had spots on it and she got Shout Wipes and started cleaning it. Excellent customer service. And the cashier's that was behind the desk did everything possible to help me and put a smile on my face. I couldn't get credit for them and them ladies put a smile on my face. I was approved instantly. And spent alot of money there. Love u girls at Horton plaza.</Text>

I absolutely love this place and find them very professional! My nail lady is Kim and she’s so great at what she does, is always gentle, and is so social and welcoming! I can’t wait to go back there and support their business once Covid settles down. They will always have my repeat business.</Text>

But I do love how he shapes my nails PERFECTLY SMOOTH & NO LUMPS, BUMPS OR WHATEVER. I could of went to my all time favorite USA NAILS and got it for cheaper (they do a great job there!!). I gave it a three star simply because the owner is nice! IF I REALLY NEED TO I MIGHT STOP BY BUT I DOUBT IT. THX FOR THE SERVICE!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Asked for coffin and medium length. Guy named Kenny attended me. The nails are extremely thick and crooked and not coffin at all. This wasn't even the color i picked out. 2 hours for this quality?! Will never return. Do not waste your time or money!!!< /Review>

Honestly I would keep this place five star because of my nails but the guy that did my mom’s nails did I’m horribly she wanted medium length coffin shaped nails she got thick and he filed the nail when the paint already on there so it messed up the paint on the nail and he was reallyRough with her but the lady I forgot her name that did my nails did them really good I wanted a light blue nails with flames and she took her time and they came out really nice</review>

I took my girl here... they are pretty friendly but they didn’t do such a great job at shaping her nails and they put to many coats of nail polish and not only on her nails but on her skin as well wouldn’t be my first choice to go choice<//Review>

Staff was very nice and the salon is very nicely kept. Very clean, but very over priced I was charged $65 for a mani and pedi. Gel on my hands and regular polish on my toes.  My sister in law had a full set of acrylic gel nails and pedi and was charged the same amount ($65) I thought this was bizarre. Wouldn’t come here again because of this reason.< /Text>

It was my first time and honestly the lady I had took her time and literally perfected every nail double checking both hands had the same nail length and everything. I came in with a picture of how I wanted my nails and she it didn't quite have the exact look but my nails came out absolutely gorgeous! The staff are friendly as well. Greeted every customer that walked in and shared conversations and laughs.<//Review>

<text>Usually pretty good but, I went in a few days ago to get my acrylic nails removed. They were getting ready to pry them off and rip and damage my real nail. I told them I wanted them to have my acrylics soaked in acetone instead because there is no pain or damage on the nail bed this way. The owner was rude and said they couldn't do it..but then said if they did they had to charge me extra..but she insisted on not being able to do it..then she said ok but for an additional charge. I was so upset, I felt like, first why are you arguing with me, and second its less work for the tech to soak cotton ball and but it on top of my nail ..plus no pain if they do it this way. The owner lady charged mw $16 dollars to soak my finger nails in acetone..crazy.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>This nail salon is wonderful! Im so glad i started going here. Its small but very intimate in my opinion. I use to go to signature but this nail salon is so much better because they are smaller. They have somewhere between 4-6 spa chairs and nail stations. They also have a private waxing room. The only thing i do t lile about the wax room is that they do not have disposable paper to lay down on. Overall they seem to be very clean! They use liners on the spa chairs. One of the ladies, shes older, she is amazing with pedicures. She very attentive and her massages are great but only of you like a deep massage. Usually ill get a massage somewhere after, but now i dont bother because i have her and her massages are amazing! Ii hope they do not expand because i love the intimate feel. I do not like to be in large places really. The lady at the fron whom im assuming is the manager or owner, she is nice and i love her clothes. She always has a cute pair of shoes. Anywho, she is very professional and thats appreciated! Sherwood nail salon is a beautiful salon to come to with a friend of two or your mother. I love it and it stays the same. :-)<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I got a facial waxing and it broke my skin out HORRIBLY!! I've never had issues with my skin and acne.  I had horrible cystic bumps and acne scars for weeks after they waxed my face.  Ive had to see a medical aesthetician and have paid over $500 in chemical peels and products to restore my face to what it was before this disastrous experience.  I'm also not a fan of how they lay acrylic, I've found another salon for that also.  my nails were to thick and bulky after I asked for them to be thin.  if you're wanting Anything more than short gel nails and a pedicure,  you may want to go elsewhere.</Review>< Response>

<text>Very clean nail salon, and great decor inside. They got me in on a Tuesday right away. The pedicure massage was hardly a massage, she just ran her hands over my legs and feet to soak up the lotion, I was very disappointed with that considering I am a hairstylist on my feet all day I look forward to the massage. She mentioned she was really hungry and was going on her lunch after me, so i also felt she rushed my appointment.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I LOVE Nano! She's the best for pedis and manicures. She can paint with perfection and is so fun to talk to! The owner is very friendly and always makes sure every customer is happy and taken care of!< /Review>

I tend not to write bad reviews but they charged me $30 dollars for normal nail polish and acrylic nail. My friends told me they got ripped me off but i thought it was accurate. I guess not, also my nails are less than a week and I have 3 nails that broke already. They were also done very sloppy maybe because they were very busy but they still took very long and the lady always got lazy with the nails I would have to tell her how I want it a couple of times. I gave $5 dollar tip though. I'm not mean. If you want to go i was told to ask for the guy, he knows what he's doing.</Text>

Got a facial here and it broke my face out way worse than before. My best friend also asked for acrylic nails and regular polish, but they have her gel polish and charged over $20 extra. It also chipped within the next day and one of her nails broke off within 3 days. Horrible experience!< /review>

I give 3 stars because they do a really good job, but they seriously need to get more employees... two times I have been in, they have turned me down because they were understaffed! Seriously aggravating!<//Review>

<UserId.>112382941246262704422< /UserId.><Review>Do NOT get acrylic nails here. In ONE week six of my nails broke, I work with money so it's not like I have a job where it would possibly cause the damage to happen. My first nail broke while I was putting numbers in on a calculator the night after I got them done. When I went back and explained the situation they gladly replaced it with a new nail which was great. But then another broke and one became two and two became six within one week. When I called and asked for them to replace the nails they said they'd fix the broken ones but would charge me to replace the whole set. When more than HALF was already broken! This place is a total rip off, don't waste your time.< /Review><date>1462684278173<//date><pictures>None<//pictures><rate>1< /rate><gmapID>0x80900c50a2487937:0x6938f838021feb70< /gmapID></record>

I would not go back just because of the fact that I went to "try" to get my nails done went about 3 times and nope not going again. I had got there the 1st time around 6:10 and they close at 7 and when i got there the guy told me they were busy today and they were tired they did not want to do my nails.. I go back and they tried to charge me 50.00 for just white paint on my nails... that's a rip off</review>

<text>This facility is not secured overnight. The pedestrian gates and doors to the buildings are left completely unlocked and in some cases left propped open. If they have an alarm system they don't set it.

I had a stack of boxes fall on me in one of their units. Totally my fault. But I was hurt pretty bad and I thought I should go to urgent care for the pain in my back and ankle. By the time I crammed the stuff back in my storage unit and hobbled to my vehicle, it was a few minutes after their 7:00pm closing time. When I entered my code to the vehicle exit gate it said "access denied, no after hours access." I found an employee named Diego who tried his gate code and got the same result. Diego said he would go to the office and get a gate code that would work. He never came back.

By 7:45 I had called every phone number I had for All Right Storage and sent them an email. I even called their facility in Irvine hoping to catch someone by luck. I decided to try to track down Diego or any other employee. For almost 2 hours I wandered that facility yelling and making noise. Walking in and out of buildings, through gates, opening closed doors, etc and no one ever approached me. I never set off an alarm. I never encountered a single employee or security patrol. Needless to say if I had been a thief, no one would have stopped me from popping every lock in that place. A thief couldn't get his car on property, but that's no problem since even their dolly and cart area was unsecured and all the pedestrian gates to the street were wide open. I eventually found a friend to pick me up and I had to return for my car the next day.

I spoke to the facility manager. Basically, his response was that I shouldn't have been there after 7 and it's normal for the entire facility to be left unsecured overnight. Because "in 8 years we've never had a problem." He said that to the guy with the problem, unbelievable, right?<//text><Time>1514753847186< /Time>< name>

Nice place to store your things. Cheaper than the other self storage places by twenty dollars. I rented a 5+8 on Main Street for $125. And it was a box. Here I’ve got a 10+10 for $110 and it’s huge with room up to the ceiling. Not limited like a box was. The only downfall is it’s not 24 hours. Other than that it’s a great place to store your things.</text>

It's just like the last storage unit I had. They draw you in with good deals at first, then increase you fees every six months or so. The staff is very friendly, but the have to adhere to instructions from their coorporate bosses. Most recently there has been an increase in the mouse population. Hopefully they will do something about it soon.< /Review>

The only complaint for me is that some of the renters will park their trucks in the way but generally everyone is nice enough and respectful. I would rent here again! Also the trash cans are for the facility not really for customers but I never had to use them but once.</Text>< pictures>

The accessibility (right in the heart of otay mesa off the cactus rd.), the hours are brilliant. The staff are awesome. Check out Rosa, she is the one who processed my account and Sergio got me a great unit when I needed to upgrade. Best prices. Busy place yet the halls are virtually vacant as if everyone were proportionally and perfectly placed. If you have tho.he to move on it out or both there is no one in Thoreau ever and the few folks you do run into are super polite. This storage with the best prices, super staff, smart location and hours along with a comprehensible contract has made me gladly take a few moments out to tell you why it's so great. Honestly, this place was here exactly when I needed it. Non nonsense staff and I do believe free truck usage to move yrself in. Not sure on that but I believe it is the case. Cannot go wrong. LOVE it. Thank you.</text>

You can not reviece any mail from USPS which is a big problem if you need to receive letters or you need a po box. I used to like it but no anymore... plus my husband had to call the police to solve a issue with the owner. With so many storage options in san diego dont hassle with the headaches here! Esta tienda es muyyy mal!<//review>

Initially walking in I was attended by Alyssa right away which I appreciated. She helped my family and I find the perfect mattresses for us. I also have a one year old that wanted to go into everything and both Alyssa and Shane were super patient and kind to us the entire time. Alyssa went above and beyond to make sure we got the mattress we were looking for and at a great price also. I really enjoyed my experience today.<//Review>

<text>I give props to Alyssa Smith for helping me make an informed decision! I was shopping to replace my 20 yo mattress... I know, crazy! And she guided me rather than pressured me which I appreciate. I felt comfortable with Alyssa and kept it honest which is important for such a big investment. Overall a great experience and I finally made my purchase! Can’t wait to try it tomorrow when they deliver it. Thank you again!  :))< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Name>A M<//Name><date>1610426993064<//date>< rate>

<Text>So happy we chose Mattress Firm!!!! It was such a pleasure working with Shane! He was very knowledgeable, answered every question, and was super patient!! Needless to say I had a thousand questions. Shane helped us pick the PERFECT mattress!! We decided on the Tempr-pedic hybrid medium and we LOVE it. Thanks to Shane we purchased a mattress that absolutely works for both of us. I prefer a softer mattress and my husband prefers firm. We have both slept better than we have in years!!! We will definitely be go back for future mattress needs!!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Mattress gave out after about 8 months. Take your money elsewhere

Response to owner: I was told I'd be able to get some money back for my matress if anything went wrong regardless of conditions. Upon trying to return the lumpy and worn out bed they added a new condition, it has to be in impeccable shape. Condition shouldn't matter when the matres is broken and this isn't the info the sales woman gave me.</review>

<Text>Alyssa at this location went above and beyond to help and assist with my online purchase return.  This was the first time that I made a purchase online with Mattress Firm.  I purchased a bed frame for my little nephew because his old frame was broken.  Did nt realize that the following day, my brother stop by the house and my little nephew show him the sagging bed.  It was just a loose screw that popped out..he just screw it back and the frame was fix..(I should of inspected the frame myself first..lol). Anyways I then proceeded to the website trying to call customer care to no available, then website refer me to “Chat”.. again no one was available to chat..I then email customer service and did nt get any reply back.  I m getting pretty frustrated and disappointed at this time.  I then decided to call the local store and explain the situation to Alyssa at the Turlock store.  Instead of just explaining “Policy” can t return etc..she listen and understood my frustration and without any hesitation offer for me to come by her store and she will gladly assist and return the product at her store!  For me , excellent customer service goes a long way!  I would recommend this location to all my friends and family if they are in the market for anything bedroom related!

Thank you!

<review>My wife and I went in looking. The sales lady showed us several beds. When choosing one. It was out of price range. Sales found something comparable.  It required financing, which was easy with Progressive.
When the bed arrived, it was simple set up. And, sleeping on it. It is so comfortable.  Glad we were looking that day.

We walked in without any real expectations or price idea because we knew a mattress was an investment. We also had no idea what type of mattress we would prefer as a couple or even individually. Upon entering the store, Shane Dobbins greeted us and began to show us some mattresses and made the process so much more easier than ever imagined. He was able to figure out which type of mattress would be best for us before we even knew and he was absolutely right! He organized a package for us and gave us so many options on how we could pay for our ideal set up. We decided we wanted to pay in full and came up with a budget and he was able to help us get the perfect mattress for us and helped us on a personable level that was unmatched in the sales world. He took his time, let us wander around and think out loud, and was there for our questions and concerns. We almost went to Costco but I’m so glad we didn’t. It was both of our first time in a mattress firm and Shane made us realize it’s the only place we will ever go for our mattress needs! If you are in the Central Valley, go see Shane at Mattress Firm in Turlock and you will have all your needs and wants met at the perfect price for you!< /text>

I got a lot of help from Shane helping me to compare different options on the mattress and I got the purple firm. I got a good price for good quality mattress and the delivery was easy. I also got the warranty. Overall I'm really happy and I know I'm going to sleep 💤 waking up fresh. Thanks Shane for your help and I do recommend this store.<//Review>

<Review>After eyeing the Purple mattress 4 for several months, I finally bought the Purple mattress and adjustable frame. It was really a piece of cake. Shane set me up with the exact bed that I wanted, and the delivery date is the day after tomorrow. Shane had us out the door, with stars in our  eyes, in about 20 minutes. Easy peasy. Thanks Shane. 🥰<//Review><Name>Douglas Puett</Name><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>5< /Rate><UserId.>100259223818127215055<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

When we get ready to buy new mattresses we will definitely go to Mattress Firm in Turlock. I usually buy everything online but felt this was a purchase I needed to go to the store for.

Today we walked in searching for a mattress and the service we received from Shane was very attentive and professional.  He helped us find exactly what we where looking for,  with next day delivery which made us even happier.  We will definitely return to this store for our future purchases. Thank you Shane.<//Text>

I received an email that my order from another store was delayed with no estimated arrival date. I went to Mattress Firm straight from work and was given options in various price ranges that were all in stock.  I bought a BeautyRest King at an awesome price and it arrives in two days!</review>

Had a great experience with salesman, Shane. It was my fiance and my first time buying a mattress and Shane greeted us right as we walked in. He really listened to what we had to say and the feedback we had when trying out mattresses. He did not rush us in testing different mattresses and pillows and he helped us find the perfect pair. We really enjoyed our shopping experience. Can't wait for the mattress to arrive tomorrow!< /review>

They were all very friendly and made my decision easy. The manager of all the local stores helped me Galvin I think that was his name (sorry if I’m wrong) he was did a great job to make sure I would have the best bed.
Alyssa and Vince were very friendly too.
Great staff all know what they are doing.
Thank you for making it an easy experience for me.</text>

We went in on memorial day to try out the Purple mattress after seeing multiple ads, I had watched quite a few different mattress reviews leading up to then and had a basic idea of what we were looking for. We met with Shane, who is nothing short of a mattress guru, and after only 15 minutes or so we were pre-approved and he already had about 6 mattresses he wanted us to try. His knowledge on each one was very impressive, the construction, materials, the difference between the density of foams (that's a thing). He showed us mattresses at the different price ranges within our budget. He was never pushy or aggressive, the dude legitimately wants to help you get the best sleep you can. The store itself was clean and they have an amazing selection to choose from. The delivery guys were incredibly friendly and professional. Life would be so much easier if every buying experience was pleasant as this one, a 5 star rating is selling them short. Oh and shout out to Purple, because if you hadn't flooded my Instagram with a billion ads I wouldn't have gone in there and ended up with my new Stearns and Foster mattress.<//Text>

<review>Just bought a bed from here and let me tell you. Alyssa is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She helped with everything and asked questions about my wife's and I sleeping preference that I wouldn't had thought of taking into consideration when looking for a new bed. Alyssa knows her beds and wants to put your worries about a bed at ease, she also understands the importance of choosing a bed for both of us. After trying out a bed she would ask both of us more questions and recommended us another bed to fulfill both qualities to find the perfect match and I can say with with complete honesty that she did. So next time you go looking for a new bed seek out Alyssa S!!!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x8091075db4aba731:0x5655ae7c1ef73aec< /gmap_id></record>

We stopped in to look and ended up buying!  Robert was awesome and showed us around the store. Great information and no pressure.  The Buying Experience was First Class.

Deliver process was flawless from the scheduling call the night before to the 10-minutes' heads up call on delivery day.  On time and very professional crew.   We will and do recommend Robert and Mattress Firm</text>

I worked with Robert on finding a new mattress and he was incredibly helpful. He really took the time to work with us on the type of sleepers we are, and offered a lot of great suggestions. The mattress has been fantastic, and when it comes time to replace it I'll be sure to call Robert again.<//Text>

It was refreshing to shop for something relatively expensive and have sales people who actually know what they're talking about. I don't know anything about mattresses, but our salesman Robert made it all easy to understand, and helped us choose the best fit for us. Hopefully I don't need another mattress soon, but I'll definitely be coming back here for it when I do.</Text>

The sales person was extremely funny and easy to talk to. She made us feel welcome and the beds were very comfortable to try. I am very happy with the results and going here is something I strongly recommend for anyone looking for a bed. My kids had an enjoyable time playing on the beds they had for display and never a hassle in time in my day.<//Text>

<rate>3< /rate><review>Edited 3/22. Received a call from mattress firm that the would upgrade the bed frame and have it delivered the next day. They did exactly that. Thank you Mattress firm, I didnt have to sleep on the floor.

Was told mattress would be delivered in 1 week and it was. Base would be delivered in 2 weeks and it was NOT! I Was not notified the base would not be delivered on the scheduled date. I sat home waiting all day for a deliver that never came. Spoke with customer service and she said the base was now out of stock for 6 more weeks. They reccomend I call the store so my husband went to the store and was told it would be 3 weeks not six weeks. I am now sleeping on a mattress on the floor. If I wanted an upgraded base it would cost me 900 more. No Way! If I knew then that I would be sleeping on the floor for about 5-6 weeks total I never would have bought a bed from them. I never will again!<//review>< pictures>

Mariesa Araica, was extremely helpful. My husband and I had a terrible experience with a different mattress store in Turlock, Mariesa turned that around with her excellent costumer service!! Mariesa made us feel comfortable and took her time educating us on the different mattresses. Thank you Mariesa!</review>

This was the worst mattress buying experience I've ever had. The mattress was over priced and uncomfortable. I was told by the store manager I could return mattress.  Once the delivery guys called to say they were on there way ... we carried the mattress into our garage so random people would not be in our home. Once the delivery guys arrived they said they can't pick up the mattress if it's in the garage. I called the store manager immediately... and he said he had no idea about the policies of the company picking up the mattress. This made me even more upset to know that a store manager of sleep train has no clue about the company picking up out mattress.. yet we are supposed to allow this company with 2 random men into my home . I don't think so. Now it's going to be a horrible ordeal to get my money back.</Text>

1. Had to tell them what their sales were to get free adjustable base (they didnt know that)

2. Delivery guys cut my internet line to house with truck (no internet for 6 days)

3. Delivery was suppose to give me 2 mattress protectors (they gave me one)

4. Mattress is cockeyed (not square). Off by at least 2 inches

5. Told them take it all back...said i have to pay full price for base cause its non refundable...even tho it was free (but salesman never told me base is final sale...just said you have 120 days to test mattress)

6. Have no managers to talk to. Can't even tall to corporate office...if you buy in store thats only people you can deal with to get anything done. Have to wait days for response.< /review>

But this may help you make your life easier. I'm fairly handy. I usually know what I'm looking for, I almost always know what it's called. What I NEVER know is where it is in the store. If you go to their website and search for the part you need, it will text you the aisle and bay it's supposed to be in. Mine happened to be on the end cap which is noted as EC1 or EC2.<//text>< Response>

Suzie was so helpful in Pro Services. She was so patient with me and she's a treasure to Pro Services at Home Depot. Hope I get her help all the time.<//Review>

I love home depot, sometimes I just go in to browse and get ideas for home projects.  My only complaint would be that most employees  don't know much about the products sold there, only where they are located.  I thank my lucky stars for being mechanical.<//review>

Good place to shop. Everyone follows the cdc (covid) guidelines. They carry the essentials here so if anyone is having trouble getting their hands on some, try Home Depot.</text>

The Customer Service was 👍!  Son had interaction with an associate, inquiring about a product we were searching for.  The young lady pointed us in the correct direction!  👍
Sad though, to see a few customers, NOT maintaining the social distancing.
Even though, the overhead speakers were announcing the safety precautions, everyone should be taking...  😞😒😣😟</Text>

Oh man I like Home Depot I, bought some beautiful plants cost me about $67 but they were worth it. And I guarantee your plants on diet if they do you can take them back and get a refund or some more plants you can't beat that with a stick</Text>

<text>Great store, locations everywhere, but I always end up at this location, the employees
are always willing to go out of their way and spend as much time as you need to be sure you understand what you need for your D I Y
project. A special Thanks to Ms Janet in paint,she had a answer for all my questions.
Could not be happier with my purchases.Keep up the good work people.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>They wouldn't stop announcing for customers to leave.

Don't ask for last minute help.
They literally came last minute to half way send me off looking for my own items.

Frustrating! I ordered a product for delivery then get an email to pick it up from a location 15 miles from my home. I did not have the time to waste for the product. I responded to email asking me to pick it up and I told them I wanted it delivered. Fast forward to 10 emails from Home Depot asking me to pick up the item. I tried calling the location (Rialto) twice and gave up around the 18-20 minute mark of being on hold. Absolutely terrible service, if you can email me why can't I email you back with instructions. I will try Lowes next time and see if they are any better.<//Text>

This place is a joke! Can't get thru in front of store, blocked off due to curb side pickup, another word for lazy! All these signs and no one using! In store wanted peg board, but needed it cut 36" by 8', they don't cut it, but everything else! Did I mention this place sucks? I guess I have to buy a truck to get a 10.00 peg board home!< /Review>

Today July 28 I went to Home Depot in Rialto. They allow people without masks in their store. Their sign says MUST wear a mask. Obviously Home Depot is more interested in making money than protecting their customers health. I just became a Lowe’s customer.</Review>

<text>They would rather have 20 people in line  then pull the girls from the front door doing nothing but saying hi to you when you walk in. They have someone standing at the line telling people when a register is open. You wouldn't even need her if she was at a register.  Who's running this store?< /text>< gmap_id>

I like the store just the casher in grading  over charged me on mulch. It was $2.50 per bag and she charged me $3.33 per bag. And was too lazy to price ✔  when told the correct price.</Review>

Everyone I've dealt with has been extremely helpful & courteous. Last few visits have been online order pick ups & ship to store (locker) so far seamless! Looking forward to my next project so I can order some more!!< /Review>

No wait to enter. Not very many people in the store. I was helped by a friendly employee.  Most customers did not try to maintain social distancing. Check out line was ling but fast as they had 4 checkers.<//Text>

< review>
Horrible service went bought blinds and then the blinds had already been returned from someone else parts were missing and blinds had already been cut. Then we took them back and the girl at the return register and she asked if we had 8 cents so i gave her a quarter and she still gave the other change and tried to keep the quarter. And got bothered when i asked for it back because the whole reason I gave her the quarter was to give us a $5 bill back....then when we needed a key made asked 3x and waited 15 minutes the guy said he was coming and then a few minutes later we see him walking through the front all the way around to avoid us so we just left itvwas so horrible.< /review>

< Review>
The reason why I am giving it a 3 is because I was in the garden department and they do not have a X where people should stand in line and we're still in the middle of a pandemic and a lot of people were in there we also need to be very careful in my opinion because it's not over yet! On the other hand we're getting carpet from there and a lady named Xena was very helpful and nice very hard getting ahold of people there but once I got a hold of her I was very happy with her!< /Review>

It's a great idea. But by the time I found where to pick items up and showed ID and they looked it up got me the paperwork then checked my receipt again before I left the store by all that time I could have walked in by the items and left and still have come out faster. Idea needs to be improved.< /review>

<Text>I just made a quick trip to Home Depot for box of 3in self-drilling screws, a quick walk thru the garden center to look for discounted plants sometimes as much as 70% off, no luck today.
Only 50% off today, but I still scored, I left HD with 6 distressed plants, in a week  or two  they will look good as new, I usually check the end caps down the main center aisle for discounted merchandise but not today I need to get these plants home and taken care of.
If you're lucky enough to be near by when they re - stock end caps with discounted items you can find great deals, on a wide variety of,, I love the hunt.
The best items disappear fast ,,in the blink of an eye. 😉 I'm retired after 40 years in the construction Industry,HD has always been sort of a silent partner of mine, even the stock I bought in Home Depot in 1991 has been amazing, and "constantly" grows over the years.
I've shopped in hundreds of Home from the Canadian border to the Mexican literally.HD is consistent in everything they do. over the years Home Depot has became a powerful tool, asset to me and the construction industry. I gave HD the five star rating because any problems I have ever had with HD over the years were corrected immediately, with a consistently good service attitude.
I cannot think of a singlc negitive.</Text><user_id>113611421216337099418</user_id><gmapID>0x80c34d067bbdb0cb:0xb7e23a9266d5dd9a</gmapID></record>

Horrible customer service, I bought a lawnmower there used it once and it stopped working, they refused to take it back, I work out of town so bringing it in has been quite a task since I’m never home,  apparently it was past it’s return policy (Even though it’s brand new) I’m an independent contractor for the Department Of Water And Power and SoCal Gas. Customer service is our number one priority. It’s unfortunate an establishment such as this doesn’t do the same. Definitely taking my business elsewhere.</text>

Went to buy the ring and boy was I lost. This working by the name of Court Creed, helped us, and did not leave our side until we got what we came for. She even called other stores to see if they had part of the ring we needed there store did not have. She was on the phone for at least 30 minutes. She was so friendly and kind that she made it feel at ease.  If you need anything look her up she is great.. Thank you for having such a great employee that is willing to help you no matter how long it takes.< /text>

Came in to get a 3/8 coupler for a gas line. Place was clean well organized. The pipe fittings were well sorted and it was easy to find what I needed. Went to self check out and was in and out very quickly. This is the closest home Depot to me and I'm glad it's a good one.< /review>

Huge selection for home improvement. From kitchen to bathroom they have literally everything you need. Their flowers are nice but they don't have as big of selection that a green thumb would like to see. Their prices are just right. I like how they try to have products for the surrounding area. Employees are in the middle of the road, meaning some are great and others are rude. It's a 50/50 chance of getting a knowledgeable employee and someone who knows nothing.<//text>

This is cool when your looking for home improvement items. The lines are somewhat long most of the time though. I usually shop the smaller hardware stores like Neds and Ace that carry specialty item for older houses like ours. It's also an in and out shopping experience.<//text>

The hardware area sucks! The nuts and bolts bins are not stocked! Sizes are mixed with other  sizes. There doesn't seem to be anyone in charge of this dept? I overheard a sales associate recommended that a customer go to Ace Hardware.<//review>

<Text>Half the employees are friendly and polite, other half seem annoyed to help or have straight up ignored. Once me and my bf we're looking for help and when we saw an employee I said "excuse me" he looked at me and shook his head and kept walking. It was kinda funny but I haven't seen him since so I assume he's been fairly fired 💁🏻‍♀️<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>It's a good place to pick things up if you know what you want. But if you're going to order anything, go to Stella at the Pro desk. If you want your order correct that is. Most of the associates there have never done home improvements or never been on a job site.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Never buy an item that the box was resealed at store. More than likely it will be missing parts. Not worth the headache.  And when you go return it they don't take it because it needs to go to other store.<//text>< Rate>

Great place to go for any tools or supplies. Very clean store however they need to keep the isles more available. Every time I go to the section for boxes and tape it is always blocked by something they are moving.</text>

Poor customer service, not only did I not receive any assistance to load all the lumber I purchased.  When I asked question regarding pricing, I was told to go on line & down load the  home depot app.  No one there has a clue on what there doing ,only single minded people that cant multi task. Only good for clean up. Standing around lazy people.  I was asked if I needed help from 3 customers . Not one home depot employee asked or offered to assist in any thing.</Review>

I love going to Home Depot. I always want to build something when I visit. I went in for a few cleaning supplies. They have their own brand of supplies and they work just as good as the name brands, not to mention the cost is a lot cheaper.< /review>

If you like to wait and watch employees walk and look right at you and offer no type of help this is the home depot for you. Customer service is terrible then the employees have an attitude like you bothered them asking for help.</Review>

Worst. Do not ever have any contracting work done by them. A total disaster from start to finish. Sent wrong product, kept asking for more money every week for something else they had neglected to line up in the beginning. After the install I had to rent a truck to return the 17 extra boxes of tile and cement because they over ordered. Their home measuring guy ($50) must've screwed up his job too as there was so much left over. DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICES!! Unless you want nothing more than 5 weeks if stress and damaged walls.< /Review>

<text>I waited over 30 min for the Associate in Power tools to come help me with something. I was told she was assisting another customer with something but all she was doing was up at the returns desk lollygagging with another Associate about what she did Saturday night. Then when she finally came over there she acted like I was bugging her.<//text><time>1542576030053<//time></record>

Wow, what horrible experience! As a business owner in construction, dealing with Home depot is usually not a problem, but this location, and its management refuses to work on solving problems.  Today's retail is dying, and for good reason.  The management at this location are perfect example as to why retail is dying.  I don't need to hear "Please, and thank you"  I am looking for a partner, who is willing to work with my needs, a simple issue as locating a receipt and providing it to me should not be an issue!  This is a simple request, what about those who have more serious issues? The management here goes out of its way to have you drive in, make you wait, waste half your day for no logical purpose, to get a copy of your receipt!  What this management fails to understand is your backbone in any business are your customers, help them, for they have choices, and can take their business elsewhere.  You will spend more money on a new customer, than keeping the customer you have.  Build long lasting relationships that are worth more than a "Fake smile"  Be real, and get real with people, otherwise watch your business disappear.  your choice, best of luck to you!< /Review>

I always find what I need at this store the hard part finding items gladly the personnel in the floor help with a smile. The part I dont like about this store is the cashier's they are slow and out of it like they are supper board and don't care to pay attention to client's waiting to pay.< /review>

This isn't my home store.  But I have had to use them on a project most recently.  I have been there three times.  To my surprise they didn't carry any of the things I went to get.  I was even directed there by a solar panel manufacturer for a specific bonding agent to find they do not carry that particular product. Also to my surprise I found I could not get 7/16" 14tpi carriage bolts.  Or anything else in 7/16".  My recommendation is to choose another store unless you're only going for the pure basics here.<//Text>

Second time was we purchased tile flooring for our home I was told I would be able to pick it up on April 14th I called they told me Monday it would be there..I called they said should be there by Wednesday or Thursday...I called Friday and it's still not there . . .again these are the worst experiences I have had here there are plenty of helpful and knowledgable staff most days.</Text>< Pics>

Cashiers are frienly but they spend a lot of time talking to each other and they like to ignore costumers. I notice this in many home depots but just the cashiers the rest of the crew are always doing their best to provide anwers and assistance.< /review>

You need to come in with some knowledge of the project you have in mind. This particular home depot is not the worst but also not the best. You also need to know the quality of the product your looking for. Home depot sells quality and junk side by side.</Text>

Truly upset to see lumber prices going up and the quality of lumber going down. Went in this location thia morning to find that 2x3 is almost at 3 dollars a piece then to sit there for 5 minutes tossing wood to find straight pieces. Same goes for 2x4x10 pretty upset. Looks like ill be driving a little firther and hitting lowes.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The staff is very slow they take a long time to help you especially especially when you ask for something big that they have to carry with machines. Inside it is the same, you only see them walking or talking to each other and it is hard to find someone to help you.

El personal es muy lento tardan mucho en ayudarte especialmente especialmente cuando pides algo grande que tienen que cargar con máquinas.  Adentro es igual solo los vez caminando o platicando entre ellos y es trabajoso encontrar quien te ayude.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>
