KPS was available and show up on time. Their full load was enough to help eliminate 3 years worth of accumulated yard debris leftover from storms and random furniture that we no longer used.  Laborers were respectful and cheerful, in spite of the condition of the junk. SO GRATEFUL for their service, now I can get on with landscaping and returning my back yard to it's former glory. Thanks again, guys, so grateful to find a local company to get this done.< /Review>

Great service! Called them up to get rid of a sofa and 2 recliners, after I had already called around and to my surprise Kevin was willing to negotiate price and able to schedule us in a.s.a.p. at such short notice. Will definitely be using their services again soon. Great customer service also!<//review>

< Review>
Came and picked up half of my stuff at 10 go on lunch break from 11 to 2:30 and never showed up again. When they first came over they start asking for more money than initially agreed on. Guess its great to have an almost 4 hour lunch break. I would reccomend going somewhere else because they're unreliable and won't come back from a lunch break. First off I'd like start off by pointing out a lot of lies this guy just wrote. We never shook hands and I never asked for your card. I don't have this guy's card. And my wife hired this guy not me I never heard of this place before. The only compliment I can give is the 2 guys you brought over to help out they seemed like hard workers. I appreciate your offer to  come back and work for me but I'll gladly pass.<//Review>
<pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1582311962136, 'text': "Good morning, I apologize for the miscommunication, Yesterday when we showed up there was  a lot more items to be hauled away, more then we agreed on the night before, which is why we had to make a second trip at know additional cost to you. When you called while we where at the dump I informed you that there was a long line, you told me don't worry take your time, when we came back to complete the job, you shook my hand took my business card, and told me you're going to be remodeling your place and that you were going call me to remove the old kitchen cabinets ect\nWhen I saw this review I was totally shocked, you led me to believe there was no complaints, and that you would be doing business with us in the future. However, if these are your true feelings I truly apologize and if there is anything I can do to make it right, I am more then willing to refund a portion of the money, and give you a discount on the remodeling project you have coming up."}< /resp>< gmap_id>

Kevin and his crew came out with a day notice. Called Kevin and explained my situation, sent a couple pictures, he called me back with an estimate. Kevin and the crew showed up as we scheduled and knocked it out. In and out within an hour. Would’ve took me multiple trips in a standard truck, plus dump fees. Quick and reliable service is what I received and would recommend giving them a call to see if they are for particular project.</Review>

<Time>1533351581031</Time><Text>I had a lot of trash and junk that I’d been wanting removed for a while. I finally gave up in my kids doing it and went to Craigslist and found K P S junk removal. It was already late in the day so was just hoping to get an estimate. Turned out Kevin came right away, gave me the estimate, and came back the same evening and cleaned it all out for me. Also sprayed it clean and made it look neat. I was very happy and will definitely use this service again in the future!!< /Text>< rate>

These pictures were from Friday June 30, 2017, in celebration for July 4.  Great place for seniors to enjoy activities, including free and discounted educational classes.  They have a deli and gift shop, billiards room, library, bocce ball, discounted senior lunch program Monday through Friday.  There are also many wonderful people that work and volunteer, to help seniors connect with assistance and resources within their community.<//review>

Attended a baby birthday party here.  The parents rented the space and had food caterers set up food prepared elsewhere and served warm here over sterno.  Parking was easy.  Space in the inner courtyard for kids to spread out and play.  Very family friendly location.</text>

The first time I came to the salon and had the best pedicure every one was really nice. This time I had a scheduled appointment. I arrived on time for a pedicure. I was told to go to the spa chair, where I sat for 30 to 40 minutes in water. Of course, no one apologized and no one came to check on me. I don’t see myself being a regular customer because I see how returning customers are treated. I would not recommend this place to anyone.< /text>

If you plan on getting Waxed do not go here. They double dip and that is not sanitary.</Review>

I can walk in but because the place can get busy, I usually make an appointment to see Mary (she's in the blue eyeglasses) and can sit down and get right to the pedicure. I'm usually the only guy in there but I like that I can get in and out rather quickly and with a high quality pedicure. I give this place and Mary 5 stars!!!

All are very skilled but I recommend Mary!!!< /text><Date>1542072266862</Date></record>

<Review>Great experience!  This was my first time at this location and thought is was a great experience.  As expected, I entered the spa and saw a number of ladies getting their feet done but I liked that the location was not crowded.  There are a number of nail spa's in the Lakewood area that are very busy, which is great for the spa but not a great feeling for me.  I was asked about the options and was surprised that the rates were very reasonable ($27.00 for premium pedicure).  I can say that I enjoyed the hot stone massage and the exfoliating wrap/wipe with the hot towels.  I recommend Moda Nail Spa to anyone (especially guys...we must take care of our feet, it is not only for the ladies)!!!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x80dd328121f7a577:0x2391b4e01c0245a9<//gmapID><Rating>5</Rating>< response>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd328121f7a577:0x2391b4e01c0245a9</Gmap_id><review>The worst experience of my life with my nails.  Apparently I had water under my nails because they find the cheap way of doing a fill.  I told them 1.5 weeks ago Kate said no its find. I went in last night and I had the start of fungus under my nails which had to replace all my nails at my cost.  The glue does not work when your natural nail starts to grow at a curve.  Then the worthless owner tells me all you did was complain for almost 3 hours.
While helping me Kate left to start on other clients by dong a color change or not helping me. At 7:30 she asked if she could wax a walk in and I told her sorry I want to get home they were both so upset. The manager tells me not to come in again. Since all I did was complain yet not once did he come over to see what the problem was. I told him everytime your price goes up now I have fungus and you are having me pay twice as much.  If you value your life you will not go to this location unless you want to pay high price for fungus. This location is never busy and most local neighbors speak of the fungus and horrible service.  When you have a client in your chair don't leave to help someone else making them sit there its rude and bad for business.  Rude and horrible< /review>< pics>

<Review>It was my first time coming here , I saw they had a  cute spot so I was like I trust them .. I asked for a oval shape , well first of all she starting putting acrylics on which I felt she was being stingy with it compare to my usual nail spots , they were not Straight at all I told her to fix my thumb because it was leaning more to the right side and she began to put gel on , girl! She put gel on like no tomorrow , my nails came out bumpy and thick and so not straight I felt like I just finish doing the 100 coats of nail polish challenge . Point is I came out of here so unsatisfied.   😭 my friends were teasing me saying “ what are those “ so that’s why I’m never coming here again , oh and I paid $38 for some humpty dumpty nails . But I love the place it’s cute .</Review>< Pics>

Never will do business with them, I walked in tried to ask how much a manicure was and before I even got the words out, they told me "Can you come back" without even letting me ask one thing, I will not do business with people that are so rude before I even have a chance to say a thing....do not recommend!</text>

They say they are open until 7, but I came at 5 o'clock for them to tell me they were closed. Update your google link if that is the case rather than me wasting my time.< /text>

I placed a phone order at 5p to be ready by 6p. it wasnt ready when I got there at 6p- didnt get it until 620p. Only positive thing was the manager was kind about my complaint and didnt get frustrated back at me like his employee did. Not very good time management on Fridays.</text>

<Date>1575253710426< /Date><Review>I have gone there several times since it has opened. But recently since they have gotten younger workers it seems that there has been less care. Long wait times, pizza not cut completely, and bad very bad service !!! I have seen workers in the back dancing while there were customers waiting to be helped including me. Never will i go back to this location i would rather go to the one by food 4 less they know how to attened to their customers and they go to work not to mess around and have you waiting. And some of the females wear thin clothing that shows their underwear.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80940c68f8a59ecf:0x3f1e4465d2a4a925< /Gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp>< pics>

Called in an order before we got into town, had to repeat te order 3 times for 2 large stuffed crust pepperoni pizzas. Estimated time for pickup from 20- 55 minutes. Just... lacking customer service skills, and a sense of time to make a pizza.
But the pizza was good after we got it.< /Review>

< Review>
It's not 5 star dining I get that. But this is the only place I been to that sells a hot and ready for $6+ when everywhere else sells it for $5. Then I went 30 minutes before closing and they said they weren't gonna make the pizza I wanted because they didn't wanna have to clean the pans again.</Review>

Ok I love little ceasers abd its good for its price but I haaate the wait. If you call ahead of time and get your order thats awesome but if you just decide to drop by and its busy be prepared to wait.<//text>

Bad customer service! Girl working there told me to not come back so I haven't. Even called ahead of time and 45 min later they didn't place my order. Save your money. Go somewhere else with better workers and service.< /Review>

This is the only lil cezars that takes "FOREVER" even for the hot n readys
I thought that was supposed to be why they're called hot and Ready's cuz they're ready. Too many little kids working there they need to bring in some adults so things can run  much smoother</text>

Staff is very nice but everytime I have been here the wait is long. Even with an appointment you still have to wait over an hour. And to get an appointment  takes long as well. They need a dentist on staff that actually does extraction and root canal. Instead of having to wait months for a specialist appointment.</Text>

<Review>The specialist that did my root canal was amazing. He was efficient and I had little to no pain. I forgot to get his name but he is an Asian middle age gentleman. . I definitely would recommend if your looking for a good specialist to relieve your dental anxiety.<//Review>< Pics>

Came in 4 days ago for 2 lower wisdom tooth extractions.

**I've had 4 secondary molars extracted at once by a previous dentist a few years back and it was the most traumatic experience (I felt everything, they wouldn't listen, my mouth was cut open everywhere...sides of cheeks, roof of mouth, lips, etc). **

I was nervous to say the least about my wisdom teeth and insisted they put me under anesthetic . They accommodated my request with no issue or questions and got me scheduled quickly.

The procedure was extremely quick (from being put under , to waking up) couldn't have been more than an hour. Dr. Mashhadian had decided only one needed to be extracted while I was under anesthesia. That the second wisdom tooth wasn't the issue on my left, another tooth was responsible for the pain on that side. The staff explained everything to my boyfriend to follow up with me after anesthesia wore off.

My prescriptions were filled immediately,  the staff (Ruth and I believe Crystal?) have been nothing but kind and prompt in answering my silly follow up questions . The bill (I was originally charged for 2 wisdom tooth extractions) was lowered to accommodate the change in procedure. They also met me in the middle on a payment plan .

Although a great deal of pain and swelling is expected,  Dr.Mashhadian did an excellent job and I have no extra or unnecessary wounds in my mouth. The sutures are short enough to cause no extra irritation,  the extraction site seems to be healing quickly,  and overall my procedure / experience with Desert Dental couldn't have gone smoother.   Thank you to Desert Dental and their staff!

- A no longer traumatized patient< /review>

This was my first visit. Everything went well. I like the fact that precautions are taken for our overall safety and well being due to the covid virus. The staff and Dr that I dealt with were all very kind and pleasant.  I'm very happy and satisfied.  Thank you Desert Dental Group for a great experience.< /Review>

I told her my teeth were sensitive and she uses this tool to blow cold air over my teeth causing me more pain??? No compassion at all in this place.

< Review>
My kid is very afraid of any kind of doctors, I requested for the specialist so he could be tight up since the first time I called. They didn't make the appointment for the specialist, so first time I show up is so they can let me know I need a "specialist appointment". They set up the appointment for the specialist this time. I show up and my 3 year old son starts crying and screaming, they argue they can't help hold a 3 year kid. I believe they just didn't want to deal with us. So they decided to refer me to the anesthesia, but the recepcionist gave them the wrong DOB of my son. After wasting 4 weeks and my son still needing treatment. I decided to go somewhere else. I went to western dental kids on El Monte. I made an appointment on Monday for upcoming Wednesday (2 days after). I arrived at 11 am and I was out by 1pm with all treatment done. I fully recommend WENSTER DENTAL KIDS on El Monte. ( They accept IHP).< /Review>

Had an appointment at 3:30 showed up at 3:15 waited an hour and a half. Other people showed up after me and were taken into the back before me. I can understand having a long wait time when your busy. But when there is no one in the lobby there is no reason for an hour and a half wait.<//review>

We do try to keep the wait times as short as possible, unfortunately some procedures take longer than anticipated and we can get a little backed up. I have passed your concerns on to our office staff so we can take steps to ensure that your next visit goes as smoothly as possible. Keep in mind that there are different treatment areas in the back so different patients are taken back for different treatments with multiple providers. Thank you for letting us know of your concerns!"}< /response>

<Text>I found Desert Dental Group to be professional and yet friendly. From the front receptionist to the dental assistant to the dentist herself. I received everything I was there for. I was offered alternatives to what I was there for as well as convenient payment plans. I feel the dentist assistant went a little beyond her EXPECTED! duties. The dentist said to her, "oh thank you, you saved me some time.  I would definitely recommend them. 😁🌹< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Everyone was friendly and clean. I always enjoy this practice because their office has a nice atmosphere and outside everything looks well kept. I did notice that there are a ton of advertisement signs on the windows though, but obviously that didn’t affect my visit, it was just a bit tacky. I don’t remember it being that way before. They also had a new machine for doing x-rays of your teeth and it was a lot more comfortable than the one they used to have, so that was a plus. I miss the complimentary 🍏’s! Otherwise, it was pleasant. Personally, if aesthetics matter to you and comfort, this place is great.💜<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This dental group is fantastic!. The front office staff are so efficient warm and friendly  The Dentist have the most up to date technology and experience.  I would highly recommend this group if you have fears or sensitive dental needs. I had to have a root canal done with a microscope and they fixed me up tight away. They explained everything.  I would easily say give them a try<//Review><user>104163083498670542841<//user>< GmapID>

<review>Not a good dental office. I should have known when the girl next to me in the waiting room came out crying. I went in on a Saturday emergency because I had a tooth ache. I paid $29 cash for a 5 minute appointment to tell me my wisdom teeth need to be pulled. I go to my appointment prepared to take out my wisdoms and the oral Surgeon said to only pull the one hurting me because I should have had them pulled when I was teenager (he was not nice, very overbearing and, talked down to me every time I asked a questions, as well as got upset when I told him my other dentist recommended something else. He made me cry because he was so rude and not understanding that I just want to make sure my teeth stay nice and straight. I should be able to ask questions without feeling like I did something wrong.). In the end, the office manager got very defensive also when they wanted to charge me $500 to pull one tooth saying it was not covered at all by my insurance. When my old dentist (who I am back with now. Who I should have stayed with in the first place) is only charging me $40 to pull the tooth and $150 IF I need to be put to sleep. That’s a big difference!! They tried to rip me off and they were very rude to the point of making me cry. I will never go there again nor will I ever recommend them.<//review>< date>

I really did love this office. Unfortunately I had a terrible experience that lasted months and was like pulling teeth getting a response in person, by phone or email from the office manager. MONTHS. It’s too exhausting going through it all again but I finally had to figure it out with only the help of my dental insurance provider who only got this office to comply after filing a grievance. If you do go here, just beware of fraudulent and overcharging. If you have HMO insurance please pay attention to what you are being billed for (ALWAYS ask for itemized receipts) and what is actually being presented to the insurance company. I fought for it and received my refund but should never have been overcharged $600+. I wasn’t the first and I’m sure I am not the last. IF it was an honest mistake, which according to the itemized statements, it clearly wasn’t, it was never relayed to me. It was never relayed to me why this happened at all. What’s funny is it was a comment that was made by one of the assistants that caused me to question it, so I thank her for that!<//review>

After trying four other kids dentist I finally found the rigth one for my kids. Yes there is a long wait for seeing the specialist but I'll wait two three hours here before I go anywhere else. They treat you with kindness and they treat your kids very kindly As well. They give your kids toys,they carry them,they offer water and try their best to accommodate you.
My son gave me a really hard time with all the other dentist. HERE they kept him calm and I was happy that they offer other measures besides sedation.</Text>

<time>1480744854673< /time><review>I initially went to this office to get a filling that had fell out on it's own overtime that was installed by my previous dentist and as soon as I walked into this office I was greeted with a smile and great communication. They've also answered every question I've had about my insurance and if they didn't know the answer the lady would call and ask for me. Both the assistants/techs and doctors were kind but the two who stood out the most to me were Nancy and specially Gigi. Gigi shows she has a big heart and lightens up the room with her attitude. Like any office it takes a few minutes to process things here and there but people fail to remember that they're not the only ones there. Keep up the good work, thank you!<//review></record>

< Review>
Last Saturday my daughter suffered a severe trauma to her front teeth while out of town with her church group.  My husband took her to Desert Dental as it was open on a Saturday.  They immediately took her in and treated her.  Due to their expeditious and excellent treatment, my daughter has been able to retain a tooth that otherwise may have not been salvageable.   We are forever grateful to Dr. Javid and his staff who provided our daughter with such fine care.< /Review>

Today I went to have crowns put on. Worst experience ever! I usually never have a problem. My crowns are too big and I can't even eat my food. I've been in tears all day. The doctor acted like he was in a hurry and just fussy today.</Review>

Scheduled for 3 fillings and paid for 3 fillings. Yet they only did one. Yes only one, unheard of right?! And that took 2 hours alone! Worst part is my filling was left too high! I feel like I wasted my time here with this lazy dental office. I took the day off work for nothing. All I could do was cry that's how upset I was ... Beyond disappointed. We will no longer be returning to this place! I'll take my money else where!</Text>

Front desk is awsome. Very welcoming and friendly. Dental assistants also do a great job when it comes to working with kids, very patient  and understanding with kids that are afraid of the dentists. My  kids felt very secure and they loved the way eveyone was. The only thing that i dislike is the wait, my appointment was at 3 and by 350 my kids were called in..I sure hopw this can be a bit improved.< /Review>

They basically scammed me. Went in, they claimed my insurance only covered 1 visit a year, and charged me for the visit. They also wanted me to get some expensive procedures done for about $2000, and said my insurance didn't cover anything. Turns out it was all BS. Called my insurance, they said no, they had no legal right to charge me for my visit, and they did cover more then a few items. DDG pretty much pretended that my insurance covered nothing, so they could charge me for procedures out of pocket. Been in talks with my insurance and already working to have this place dealt with. Meanwhile, looking to find a new dentist that hopefully wont try and scam me out of money.</review>

My experience with Dr H. Kalimuddin was exceptional. He made me laugh. Thanks doc. It is not fun having your teeth worked on, but you made the experience relaxing. Love my teeth. 5 stars.

Hygienist, Sahal Jamily, she was very gentle and professional as well. 5 stars.

Thanks everyone.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I'm quite sure they're all true. Been there twice to see the endodontist because I've needed a root canal for awhile. Dr. VanPol says drill up through the gold crown and clean the roots , sterilize and put in temporary filling. Having had several of these in the past I said why don't you put in a permanent filling which is what was always done before. He says because you go back to the dentist that gave the referral. Makes no sense to open up the tooth again and expose it to possible bacteria which is what caused the infection in the first place. He says he can do the permanent filling no problem but it's up to the office. I had this all arranged with a 3 way conference call between myself , dental health services my insurance co. and Crystal the treatment plan supervisor at the dental office. When I went in to get it done Van Pol says I never told you I can do a permanent filling , lying thru his teeth , that goes back to the dentist maybe since it's the same location the dentist can do it right why your are in the chair. So now the office manager comes in because this Crystal wants nothing to do with this one. She says I called the dentist who was out to lunch and he said you will need a new crown and he can do it right after the endodontist finishes for another $450 plus what they'll bill my insurance co. I'm 72 and the gold crown he wants to destroy will probably last me the rest of my life if I make it to 95. I have one now that was put on in 1977 that's still good , he will put on a porcelain one they last about 10 years all so he can line his wallet. This place scams everyone like that , all they want is the money. If there's 2-3 ways to get a good result they pick the most expensive one like other posts have said. They have 12 signs on their outside windows and a big billboard video sign too , reminds me of a used car dealer. It's a good place to get screwed. By the way I had gotten out of the dental chair and watched this office manager the whole time with out her knowing it , she never called the dentist or anyone else , so she's a liar and so is the endodontist who sacrificed his integrity because he was told not to say things like that because the dentist has to make his money too. I would avoid this place like the plague. I gave the place one star  should be 0000 Update , I went to a real endodontist cause I actually needed 2 root canals on gold crowns then back to my old dentist who put permanent silver fillings in both for a total of $200.</text>< pics>

My review is for the kids office honestly worst experience ever they took like 5 hours for one of my daughters fillings and wanted to do so many baby root canals I felt like it was too much and ended up getting a second opinion and they ended up taking out spacers they put in because they were unnecessary and no root canals necessary.... honestly never taking my kids here again worst place ever!!!!!< /Text>

Their ability to complete a BIG JOB and....still make me feel comfortable and NO PAIN (anesthesia up the A** (excuse my language)....makes them some sort of super hero's j/k!!! (Grace be to GOD....)

<Text>This is the worst dental office. Your child has an appointment at 10:30 and is not called to the dental exam room until after 11:00 to sit and wait some more. The dentist doesn't come in the room until after 11:30 a might start at 11:45 if you are lucky. The front desk has the audacity to get offended when questioned about the wait. One star is too much.</Text><Name>vikki hasson< /Name><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

Hey Victor Santos – lets be real – we all were there the day of the specialist bc we were not taking care of our kids teeth. I have been going to Desert Dental for years with my other kids, and they are always fast and nice. Yeah, there was a long wait cuz of ALL the kids had messed up teeth and none of us wanted to go to loma linda and have to wait 8-9hrs for loma linda just to take a look, and then have to come back to loma linda for another 8-9hrs to get the cavetys done. Let me ask you a question, they finish your kids mouth or not? Cuz they did my kids whole mouth! Imma be a better parent and really take care of my sons mouth, hopefully you will too bro. AND bro, you should be happy there is a close place that will take care of our kids! No other office would take my son, so thanks Desert Dental.<//Text>

horrible experience. I made an appointment to have my teeth cleaned. after 45 minutes in the lobby they examined me and I went back to the lobby for another 15 to 20 minutes. Then I was sent to the " finance" person to discuss payment options! seems they found $3,500.00 worth of additional work, I didn't know it was even bothering me. after all this they REFUSED to give me a light cleaning , they said they be liable.< /Text>

Bought a nice ford crown victoria from here 3 years ago, since then Ive only put 10k miles on the car and the transmission started to slip. I drove it carefully and treated it like a baby. Turns out the transmission fluid was very dirty and the filter was clogged. Also, the transmission back seal was leaking....I had great customer service and they gave me a great price when i got it. I'm just a little hurt knowing that the transmission wasn't inspected at first.</text>

These guys were really good to me, but I came there knowing exactly what I wanted, and paid cash, so that helped.
The ABS computer was down, they offered to replace it for free.  Had I had to go to Ford and do that myself, I'm fairly certain it would have cost me a pretty penny.  So I'm grateful they took care of that outright from the beginning.  Yes I would recommend this dealer to others.
Their plot of land is small, so they can only fit so much inventory at a time, but vehicles turn over quickly, so check back often.  If they bought the vehicle from auction, just keep your expectations real, and realize that it more likely than not isn't going to be perfect... but with careful research and the Car Fox report... you can make an informed decision.<//review>

<Review>Marc was simply amazing. Easy to talk to, very professional, and valued his customers more than anything. I was able to finance a car easier than any dealership I’ve ever been too and it was all thanks to him. The people he works with are easy to deal with and fight to get the best deal for you and I was able to witness it first hand. I will be going back again and referring anyone else to them as well.< /Review>< user_name>

Really great place. I bought a 2008 Ford Crown Victoria and I got a really good discount. The car has been running great for the past 2 years. The staff is courteous and very helpful.
Highly recommended.</Review>

<Gmap_id>0x809aded3f1df82bb:0x85b426acb722586d</Gmap_id><Review>I bougt my car here at Marshal Auto Sales. I was provided excellent costumer services. They let me test drive as many vehicles as I wanted till I was satisfied. For being a first time buyer, I’m Satisfied as I can be. I really recommend Marshall’s auto sales if you are looking to buy a car and get a great deal. Definitely worth a 5 star rating.</Review>< user_name>

would give 0 if I could. Paid the 9k for the car and they wouldn't allow my father to use the restroom. We were told to use the restroom next door and were almost assaulted by someone. They argued and gave attitude when I asked questions.  i asked if my car had warranty and was told yes, when i went home my starter went out, when I called suddenly i didnt have warranty and passed the time limit to get it. Terrible conpany, would never buy from them again. 0 hospitality, i felt like a burden.</Text>

<review>Very happy with my purchase. They were more then willing to open up Sunday so I could buy a car. The process was quick and easy. I would recommend friends to come and look here if they are wanting to buy a car.< /review>< gmap_id>

I bought a Honda Civic a a couple years ago and ran great. Once my family grew I needed a bigger car. We got a Chevy Tahoe from Marshall’s. Customer service was great and very helpful if I had any questions on paper work. Great place to get a car.</Review>

Total bait and switch. Listed a van. Went to check it out after the ad said: financing. Zero down. SSI welcome. Got there and was told that the van is "cash only" and if I DID finance, they would need a couple grand down payment. Total BS. Tried to get me in a newer car.</Review>

I was interested in one of their vehicles for sale. The sales men knew very little about it, but they assured me the vehicle did not have any issues. I drove several hours to their dealership and looked under the vehicle to see it was clearly leaking fluids and the dealership must have known about it since there were several pizza boxes under the vehicle to soak up the oil. Avoid this dishonest dealership.< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>The best dealership in town. I bought 2 cars and i will say the best service ever provided. The staff is friendly and they take very good care of their customers. Cars are very good and i have been using them. Not even a single penny work required. 10/10 cars and they take extra care of their customers. Will definately continue buying cars. If you want good cars with good price you dont need to go anywhere else. Marshall auto sales have all you need. And they finance the minimum amount you can get.

Regards
A happy customer. :) :) :)<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Worst Place ever. They say one thing to get you. Once paper work is done EVERYTHING changes. Do Not Trust these people. And their 5 star reviews are from contracted people. There are some good used lots out there this one IS NOT ONE OF THEM!! STAY AWAY!!</Text>

<Review>Great "dairy bar" to stop at for a burger or ice cream while out checking out the waterfalls or on your way to Lassen National Park. I had a yummy bacon cheeseburger (on a toasted bun) and onion rings. Delicious, it really hit the spot.< /Review>< pics>

Five stars on the tater tots and onion rings they were both fried to just the right crisp. The chili beans and my strawberry shake were also good. Not many other restaurant options, in fact i think it might be the only one closest to the falls so don’t be too picky.<//text>

The food is good, but wear a bib! There is extra everything on the burgers, so wet the bun just fell apart.</text>

One of my favorite burger spots. Burgers are huge, hot straight out of the fryer totts/fries. Friendly people. Delicious shakes. A little pricey with a bit of a wait but worth it!< /text>

I just had a chocolate milkshake, so I cannot comment on the food. It tasted ok, nothing special. They don't have whipped cream, which seemed pretty odd. I got very sick that night, did not have anything else to eat after the milkshake, so likely it was the cause. Overall, I would say go right down the road to the Alpine frosty in Burney. If nothing else, they have whipped cream.< /review>

Was thinking about going to McDonald's which was a few miles down the street. Then I figure I help support local business's in this time of pandemic covid-19. Ordered a few cheeseburgers potatoes salad and strawberry shake. Worth the stop. It's also like 500 feet from my folks place. Quaint lil burger joint. Not too shabby hit the spot just nice. Good spot to grab a burger in a pinch. Would come back again so I recommend a try.</Text>

I love this little business, but so does everyone else. It sometimes gets very crowded. Their service is top rate and very reasonably priced.< /text>

Very rude owner.  I went in to leave a box from Direct T.V and didn't have it completely sealed and needed ONE strip of tape.  He wanted to charge me 50 cents which I would have paid just to send the package but didn't have any cash on me.  He said in a very sarcastic manner, "just leave it there (the open box) and we'll see what happens."  Since I didn't have the cash and was not about to use a credit card for 50 cents I said I would be back because he would not tape the box for me.  He then state as I was leaving "We just got tired of giving everything away."  I guess he doesn't mind giving my business away since I will not return there again.  I will use the post office.  Yes, they are rude sometimes too, but they are not the owners.  Enjoy your 50 cent strip of tape.<//text>

At a time when LA County issued an order requiring all businesses to wear mask these employees ignore order. I was just in there yesterday, and the 2 girls working had no mask on. Nor did they ask customers to wear one as entering.< /Text>

<review>i went in on monday to send my grandson a birthday gift,. I specificlly asked for fed ex.  and was not taken care of right away. they even helped 2 peopl;e ahead of me. they had to ask the gentleman to finish me uip at least 3x.  He signed me up for postal service instead of fed ex. because it was being sent directly to fed ex they could not accept it.  so it was refused.  my grandson did not get his gift.  I called the office and they could not do the courtisy to resend it the right way.  Is it my fault for not checking the receipt? Shame on you guys.  such good service? not for me or my grandson. now i have to wait till it comes back to resend.< /review>< Pics>

<Date>1609816395420< /Date><review>Wonderful place for shopping with wide variety of all Indian and american groceries and a single place to shop for various utensils, sweets, Samosa, Religious books, Hindu and sikh religious articles, clothes, Blankets, Suitcase, Pagri, ayurvedic medicines, fresh produce, frozen stuffs with authentic punjabi taste, Punjabi Manja, Big Tandoors and many other things available. We are new to this place and went for the first time, have an amazing experience of shopping with owner Gurbakh Kaur ji. She is super friendly and showed all the stuffs with great humility and helped us in making best choices. We highly recommend this place.</review><rate>5<//rate>< user>

I believe this used to be an auto parts store around 2000. Napa Auto Parts I think. I've been here a couple of times with my husband and it was really interesting. I like all the different stuff you can get.<//text>

They have fresh veggies and the frozen dosas are soooo good.  They don't have meat but right next door is the meat shop. They also do indian clothing alterations and sell Indian dishware too. I got there 2 times a month to get my indian groceries.< /text>

< review>
We've used Caccia Plumbing several times in the past. They are prompt in returning our call and in scheduling appointments. They sent a picture of    Joe Sullivan, the plumber, who we would expect to come that day.
Joe was on time and very mindful about safety protocols because of the pandemic. He was ready with his own shoe covers which I had required of anyone doing work inside the house.
He diagnosed what was causing several problems we described with the kitchen faucet, the hot water supply, and the main valve that controls the water supply to the house. He also explained how he would fix them, for how long, and for how much.
He worked efficiently and answered any questions we had during the process. He kept the area neatly cleaned up after he was done.
Joe is a pro at what he does and an asset to the Caccia team.</review>

James Caccia Plumbing is still the best company I’ve had the pleasure of working for to this day. I take on lots of side jobs, occasionally plumbing, and I always mention this company when I’m asked about how I acquired my skills. The true focus on detail and quality is unmatched and a treasure I truly cherish. I had worked with them for about 8 months as an apprentice to both Morgan and Ed. I actually just did a job today replacing 3 angle stops and a kitchen faucet and not only was I complimented on my work as well as cleanliness and care for their home, I was also complimented on my tool bag! I smiled and excitedly bragged about stealing the idea from the good ole Irishman Morgan except that I made mine look cleaner. James Caccia Plumbing is a name I will always respect and a standard I will always carry with me.</text>

<review>Joseph was very knowledgeable and professional. Provided thorough explanation of work that would be done in advance of starting, then good recap at end. We’ve used Caccia Plumbing’s services many times over the years because they are reliable and always do a great job.<//review><user>100035002477756659104<//user>< Name>

I rarely give 5 stars but Caccia plumbing is actually deserving of 5 stars. Excellent on all fronts. ALL fronts. We had perhaps 6-7 engineers come during the work and every single one was professional, friendly and did a great job. This is how a company should be. They aren’t the cheapest, but you get excellent quality and the cost in not outrageous. It would use them again in a heartbeat.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Caccia has been our go to plumbing company for over 15 years, and each time they’ve come out they’ve done an excellent job.  Ofa, who’s been with Caccia for 12 years, diagnosed the cause of a slow leak below our kitchen sink and fixed it.  The workmanship was beautiful, and he’s so courteous and respectful (had shoe covers and a large cloth mat to protect work surfaces).  We highly recommend Caccia Plumbing!<//review>

<Review>We had a gas leak in our home and needed a plumber ASAP to help resolve.  A few plumbers came out to help troubleshoot. Not only did Caccia have the best quote, the team that helped us were very knowledgeable and professional. Joe S. helped diagnose the issue, and a couple days later Jeff C. and Seth came out to install the heat pump electric water heater.  Jeff and Seth were very patient with all of our questions, and adhered to all safety protocols.  We will definitely use Caccia again for any future plumbing needs (hopefully not for awhile!)< /Review>< user>

Joe Sullivan did an excellent job!   He replaced corroded water lines under my home and outside.  Joe clearly explained the work he would be doing.  He set to work and finished in the committed time.   I can comfortably recommend Caccia Plumbing and Joe.Sullivan for a job well done.</text>

Joe was a very professional plumber. I would recommend him to anyone who is looking for a knowledgeable, efficient, and congenial worker. Since plumbing is my week suit as far as home repair/maintenance, I have had many plumbers visit over the years and he was a definite stand-out. Though this is my first time using Caccia Plumbing, I will certainly call them again if I need them.< /text>

Dino  of the Caccia Plumbing was great! He performed stellar work and answered any questions and explained the equipment and the process the entire way. The entire staff were highly efficient and professional. One of the owners personally visited my home and gave an assessment of the problem and a choice of options to facilitate repairs. The work was performed the next day after another plumber had quoted two weeks just to get parts. I highly recommend Caccia Plumbing!</review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>Ed, Jeff & Jeff from Caccia Plumbing replaced our water heater when our previous one stopped working.  They were quick to send out someone to take a look, and he came up with a comprehensive and detailed quote to replace the water heater, and to rework much of the related plumbing (since our previous water heater was a discontinued model that had an integrated heat exchanger for radiant heating).  They identified several aspects of our previous installation that were not up to code (and inappropriate) and fixed them all.  Our hot water service and radiant heat work SO much better now!

Ed, Jeff & Jeff did excellent work, and were very responsive to questions and issues that came up.  They also gave me a 15 minute tour of my new plumbing so I could understand all they did.

I paid $$$ for this excellent quality of service, and the peace of mind that Caccia Plumbing stands by their work.  But to me it was worth it.<//text>< gmap_id>

<review>Technician Dino is really a true professional. He explained his services and recommendations in detail and in a way that I could understand. His safety protocols were impeccable: mask, shoe covers, gloves, floor protection. His work was first class.

Technician Ofa was also part of the team. Ofa is great. Soft-mannered, polite, knowledgeable. Team player.

I was so fortunate to have two professional, hard-working, honest, fun, intelligent technicians on my project. Caccia Plumbing is worth every penny. I recommend Caccia Plumbing highly. Thank you!< /review>< pictures>

Joe was very professional, friendly & thorough. In addition to doing high quality work (installing two showerheads & repairing a toilet), I learned a lot from his visit.

<Review>The different members of the Caccia Plumbing crew that came to fix our broken sewer line were all awesome.  Hipolito, Seth, Luis, Juan, Hugo, Pablo, and Steven ( I hope I didn't forget anyone) - a big thank you from me and my wife for getting us flowing again so quickly!  It's a dirty job, but you all performed with a smile and a great attitude.  The communication from the home office and the managers was excellent.  The estimate for timing was always spot on!  Great work,  I will use Caccia again in the future, but hopefully not for a backed up sewer line!!< /Review>< Response>

Joseph Stevenson from Caccia Plumbing did an interior inspection of all the plumbing and gas fixtures, as part of their Platinum Service. He was professional, patient with my questions (I learned a lot!), and thorough. If this is the quality of all the Caccia Plumbers doing inspections, I would definitely recommend to get the Platinum Service for a minimum of 1 year.
Update: 1 week later, another employee, Anthony Caccia, completed the video inspection of the sewer line, another service included in the Platinum Service. He and his employee in training were of the same character as Joseph - polite, professional, patient and thorough. Sharing the live video feed with the homeowner gave me peace of mind on the condition of our sewer line.<//Text>

We ended up needing new sinks as well and he told me how to buy it on amazon since they weren’t  in stock locally in order to save money.

Ofa goes above and beyond in providing services. He takes time to explain everything he sees and why he is proceeding a certain way. When there is a choice to be made, he provides us with the options and never pressures for a specific outcome. We have been more than pleased with the services he provided. Furthermore, he cleans the areas where he has worked - always a treat!< /Text>

Joe Sullivan did a great job saving me time, effort and money.  Recommend Caccia to friends, family and neighbors.  Finished the job in a timely manner and like all Caccia employees,  have knowledge and experience.

Been in the food service industry for most of my life and dealt with lots of plumbers.  The work areas are left immaculate.

Thanks Caccia, you're the best!</review>

<Review>We needed our toilet replaced and I called Caccia Plumbing and they sent one of their technicians over, Dino. A great experience all the way. From the first phone call to receiving text messages keeping me updated regarding our appointment and then getting the job done quickly and with great quality.
Dino was a great technician. He was timely, very thorough, careful to keep everything clean, and took all the precautions required during COVID. He got the job done quickly with great quality. Thanks for a good, honest worker who's skilled & careful. I highly recommend him & this company!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Horst Wend< /name>< response>

Fantastic service, I couldn't be happier.  Morgan and the rest of the team went above and beyond when replacing my water heater with a new tankless unit.   They chose installation options which used existing vents, and they worked with me to configure the system which works even better than I expected!< /text>

We had 3 different plumbers from this company come to our house, and we got 3 different stories on what was wrong.   Every time was more money.  They never looked at the pervious plumbers notes.  They just said it was a bigger issue.   I refused to pay more than the quote and some how they were able to fix the issue.  It took a lot of cussing on my part and a lot of them having excuses.   I do not recommend them.  Who ever you decide to use get everything in writing<//text>

Caccia has always addressed my plumbing problems/needs thoroughly and neatly. Today, Ofa gave me several options to repair or replace a toilet. I always appreciate having options. I had a few questions about the quotes and Anthony was extremely thorough and knowledgeable in helping me understand them. Great customer service!< /Text>

Joe did a great job, addressing the problem in one unit of our 12 unit building that affected the entire building. He was very personable with the multiple homeowners involved and with the HOA board members on site.

The one issue we had that kept this from being a five star rating, and which may lead to our HOA changing plumbing companies, was their requirement to essentially pay in advance as every other vendor we use allows. It was a new requirement this time and had never been imposed by Caccia previously over the decade or more that they have provided service to us, including replacement of the boiler system for our building. We hope that this policy will be reversed in the future and we can give them five stars on the next job.< /text>

The new toilet is in the bathroom....flushes and runs like a charm.  Nate, from Caccia, is pleasant, nice to be around and knows his "stuff"  This is the second time I have had him fix plumbing in the house; last time leaky faucet in kitchen.
I highly recommend Nate.<//Text>

<text>Had the pleasure of meeting Abnan today. Thought I could unclog a drain using Draino - how very wrong I was.

Abnan was one of the most professional, kind, and passionate people I’ve met. I totally was not expecting this type of experience with an emergency clogged drain situation.

The entire time, Abnan put me at ease about the issue and walked me through the possible options, his suggestions.

He only came to unclog a drain, but his presence and our conversations genuinely made my entire day better.

I was skeptical of the reviews and the positivity around all the experiences, but after using Caccia myself, I’m not one bit surprised.

Caccia must use the same training manuals as Chick-Fil-A or something because the customer service was top notch.

Now when I get a plumbing issue, I’ll be sort of glad, because it’ll give me another reason to support Caccia.< /text>< Pics>

Joe from Caccia Plumbing did a great job. He called prior to arriving, which I requested, Joe explained what he was going to do and the cost. Joe listened to me explain the problem and then described what he was going to do to correct the issue. Although they are expensive, I would use Caccia Plumbing anytime. You get what you pay for and I am satisfied.😊<//review>

I called first thing this morning after seeing my water heater was leaking. They responded quickly and had someone out right away to give me an estimate. Very nice man, honest about the work needed and the price. They sent out the gentleman to do the work. He was very nice, and explained again all the work he did. I feel I had top notch service for sure. I would recommend Caccia plumbing to friends.</text>

I called Caccia Plumbing to put in a tankless water heater and take care of a few odds and ends elsewhere in the house.  Jeffrey and Teddy did a great job with the removal of the old unit and new unit installation.  They stayed on task through a long day, kept the worksite neat, were super courteous throughout and had excellent fit and finish on the pipes and fixtures installed.  Teddy came back for the planning department inspection and remote programming, cleared a slow drain, replaced a corroded water shut off valve and capped an unused gas line.  Ed finished the job by amending the surface below the condensate drain and replacing a couple of balky fixture handles.  I couldn’t be happier with the work.  Thank you!</Review>

Caccia texted to let me know they were sending Dino and what time he would come. Dino arrived promptly on time. I appreciated that he wore a mask and put booties over his shoes when repairing our leaky bathroom sink inside the house. He shared his assessment of our problems and what he recommended doing. I approved his work. After he completed it, he showed me all the work he had done. I learned a few things about plumbing. In addition, he was considerate about parking his truck where it wouldn’t be in our way. We have used other plumbers in the past, but in the future, I will definitely call Caccia the next time we need a plumber.< /text>

Scheduling was easy and they showed up as promised. Ofa did a great job clearing the sewer line that had previously only been partially cleared by another plumber. I believe the use of a camera system assisted with his success. There is also a follow up visit scheduled with a camera operator that will record the length of the pipe to see if further action is necessary. I would recommend them to anyone.< /text>

<text>My water heater broke just before Christmas.  Caccia Plumbing showed up  Dec 24th, replaced the heater and fixed some other problems to make sure that we had hot water for the Holidays.   Andrei was professional, thorough and wouldn't leave until everything was working 100%.  The quality of his work was excellent.   Caccia Plumbing delivered on time, on price and exceeded the scope of work.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1609745788548, 'text': 'Thank you for your review.

Joe was on time, professional, and courteous.  Very pleasant experience.  Caccia is a bit more expensive than other plumbers, but having wasted a lot of time with others to get nothing done, it’s worth it for some jobs.<//Review>

This is the second time I've used their services.  Both times service has been excellent.  This job was bigger and Tony, one of the owners, came to the house to personally survey the job and provide an estimate.  When Jen called  that day, from the office, I was pleased to find they could do the job the next day!
Jeff, their plumber, arrived promptly the next morning and worked all day installing a new stainless steel gas line for a standby generator.  It was a big job but he came with all the materials and did a very professional job. He pressure tested the line to verify no leaks.  There were none.  He worked non-stop but for a short lunch break on site.
I am pleased to give him my highest recommendation for professionalism, knowledge, and ability to answer all my questions honestly and clearly.
My opinion is that this is a "Top of the Line" family-run business which should be copied as an example of what good Customer Service can be.
(P.S. they didn't pay me for this)< /Review>

Very pleased with the professionalism and service provided by Dino. Setting up an appointment was easy. Good communications from the Caccia office regarding time of arrival. Meticulous adherence to masking and COVID safety protocols. Dino is very knowledgeable and personable.  He carried out all repairs with excellent attention to detail. Provided estimates upfront and advised regarding alternative options. Provided useful tips for maintenance and avoidance of expensive repairs. Plan to have Dino return soon to complete some additional projects.</Review>

Nate at Caccia was very professional. Even during the issues with Covid-19, I felt comfortable with having Caccia plumbing come into the house to repair the garbage disposal. Had some questions afterwards that were answered right away.< /Review>

Excellent work- went above and beyond. Abnan and Steven came out to help with a really tough plumbing problem.  First of all, they were incredibly professional and excellent at COVID protocol.    They were very considerate of safety, cleaning their equipment thoroughly, wearing booties when coming in the house,etc.    It felt very safe.

This was a tough issue and it was hard to figure out exactly where in the pipes the issue was.  Abnan and Steven were incredible detectives, thinking through all of the possibilities and honing in on the issue.  They asked all of the right questions and experimented in ways that minimized my cost. Abnan explained the costs very clearly at each step of the way.

They persisted and persisted at every turn, crossing possibilities off the list until they found the location of the issue.  Another plumbing company had tried and failed to solve the problem a few days ago, and the head of their snake broke off and was causing MORE problems.  Abnan and Steven not only located the broken part but was able to retrieve it and clear the entire problem.

I can't say enough about the service that Abnan and Steven provided.   They definitely won a new long term customer for Caccia Plumbing.<//Text>

<text>Dino Canaku came out from Caccia plumbing to investigate a leak with water coming through in the garage.  He took a good look at other areas and informed us of things we could do to prevent major issues in the future.
The leak fix turned out to be a caulking fix needed around the shower area.. something we had done ourselves, not very well perhaps, over 7 years ago.
Dino gave us good tips about doing it right, so we'll try doing it ourselves.  All in all a good experience with a very responsive team in the background.  Will call them again if there are any bigger plumbing issues in the future.<//text>< Pictures>

Caccia was incredibly responsive to my initial query.  From the moment I reached out, my experience was top notch.  They let me know that Dino would be visiting our property to provide an estimate for the work needed.  In advance, I received a text that he was on his way and they also sent a photo of the technician (which is helpful since people show up in masks these days).  Dino was prompt and in PPE gear.  Was quick, provided the estimate, and then Caccia followed up within 24 hours.  We got 2 other estimates and these other companies were either not competitive or not as responsive.  We chose Caccia!  Dino returned at the day/time scheduled, performed the work, explained everything perfectly to someone who has zero plumbing knowledge, and again followed safety and health protocols so I (and my family) felt safe.  All in all, an A+ experience.  I will be calling Caccia for our future plumbing needs!  Thank you, Caccia and Dino!<//Text>

Both men, Joe and Joseph, took the time to explain all of the work thoroughly, made me feel very comfortable by taking the time to educate me, and most importantly did an excellent job in our bathroom and kitchen. Also, friendly with our dogs and toddler and extremely clean and organized!

Lastly, they followed many safety policies for Covid-19 which made me feel safer.

I could not recommend this company enough! Thank you Caccia team!</Review><UserId.>109425292479047227686< /UserId.>< date>

Joe Sullivan was very professional. He explained our options and did a great job. He’s also a personable young man. And he cleaned up after himself too! And wore shoe covers in the house.

I was worried that they would forget about the soap dispenser, but he didn’t! We used them before to replace a toilet and it was a good experience so I contacted them to replace the kitchen faucet. I’m so glad I did!< /Text>

I have been using Caccia Plumbing for 19 years.  Back when Geno and Anthony made house calls.   Always professional.  Always courteous. Always friendly.  And the best part is that they are EXPERTS at plumbing.  They get the job done right the first time.  Caccia Plumbing has, over the years, installed new gas lines, replaced worn out fixtures, etc, etc.  My most recent experience (May 2020) was with Caccia's Mr. Joe Sullivan.  AWESOME!!!</Review>

I’ve used Caccia Plumbing several times now and have always been impressed by their responsiveness and quality. Dino was able to replace 3 water shut off valves within an hour, even though he had to move 2 of them. He was efficient and thorough. Will continue to use them.<//review>

Caccia is extremely thorough and professional. They gave a full review and told us exactly what the situation was and our options. I greatly appreciate their level of diligence.

Come over really fast,  just couple hours after calling the service,  which is good.  However, the service was not worth the money I paid at all.  I had the water backup problem in the kitchen sink.  The guy came to use the snake to fix the problem ( looks like the problem was gone) .  However,  the water backup happened again just a month later.  I never dump any food into the drain,  and I haven’t used the garbage disposal for a long time.  I was so mad and disappointed when the problem happens again just  one month later after the service.  The service rate is really high, quality is low.  Won’t recommend it</text>

<Text>My kitchen sink backed, so I called Caccia and scheduled an appointment.  Joe from Caccia showed up right on time.  He was professional, courteous, and careful in explaining what he is doing at every step of the way.  I especially appreciated him taking the time to explain that everything including equipment and himself are disinfected between each customer.  He was thorough in disinfecting everything he touched, and put everything back where it was, including the garden hose which was left out in middle of the deck!  6 out of 5 stars!<//Text>< pics>

<UserId.>111183219433360533833< /UserId.><Review>Plumber came quickly despite the shelter-in-place order.   Plumber was courteous, clean, and wore a mask the entire time in our house.   Plumber was able to unclog the drain quickly.  Only issue was the job was a bit pricey.  When I called the office they said the $99 call out fee would be applied to any work that was done, but plumber on site tried to add that charge to the fee to snake the drain.  Total to snake the drain was ~$450 ( without the call out fee ).  Assuming the fee to snake the drain was ~$450, I think I should have been charged ~$350, but I did not press the point.  Service could be better with more transparent pricing.<//Review><Response>None</Response>< name>

<Text>Teddy was fantastic. He arrived on time, took every precaution for COVID-19, and walked me through what he would do before starting any work. He explained the process, how long it would take, and when he would check-in with me. His attitude and workmanship was professional and he was a pleasure to have in my home during these high-stress times. He completed the work in a timely manner, walked me though what he did, explained how I could troubleshoot in the future, and cleaned his entire work area. I would hire Teddy and Caccia Plumbing again.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808f9dc3deec3739:0xa6fe770e5dd29c48< /Gmap_id>< Date>

Even wit a few scheduling hiccups, the team at Caccia Plumbing still gets 5 stars.  They got someone out to our house immediately after a scheduling mix-up and Joe was great.  Super professional and friendly and had good suggestions and recommendations in terms of his thoughts on what the issue could be (there was no obvious leak) and what we should do next to sort it out. Caccia can highly recommended by friends I trust and I’ve had nothing but good experiences with them and will continue to use them going forward.</review>

We recently had some plumbing problems requiring a new line from the house to the street. As part of the work, we thought it would be a good idea to look under the house as well, as the pipes are old. That is where Caccia Plumbing comes in.
We had an excellent experience with first the inspection of the pipes and recommendations on the work needed. We then received a very detailed and quick plan of action and a quote for the work.
Of course we looked at other companies but chose Caccia for their professionalism and responsiveness.
Today, Andrei showed up within 15 minutes of the quoted time by the dispatcher. He came with a clean uniform, greeted me and reviewed the work. He even helped me move some of the items in the shed to get better access to the door leading to the crawl space. He was professional, & took the time to make sure that some items left in the shed were covered so they would not be in harms way.
The work began and we interacted several times during the work to test joints and pipes with water etc. Each time he was quite courteous. And and at the end, he cleaned up, knocked on the door, and apologized for getting a little mark on an item in the shed! He showed me pictures of his work and items corrected as well as an overall movie of the area, and reported that the work was timely as there was moisture in and around the concrete, indicating a small leak. We will be getting these for our records with a final report.
All in all, my wife and I are really impressed and would recommend highly this service for anyone needing some plumbing work. I know I can sleep now with the knowledge that we will not be having any troubles for quite some time.< /text>

These guys not only missed 1 appt... they missed 2 appointments in 1 day! I waited onsite 4 1/2 hours and no one showed up. I called to ask what was going on half way thru waiting and they apologized and said someone would be out within 2 hours... again never showed. A business can make a mistake as we all do but what sets you apart from the rest is how you handle the mistake. A phone call with an explanation or apology goes a long way.<//text>

Caccia plumbing’s technicians are well trained, polite and knowledgeable. We’ve used Caccia for many projects over the years and have been pleased with the quality of the work. We just had Nate, the technician out for a shower issue and he was great!</Text>

Nathan arrived on time and was very professional, friendly and courteous. He explained everything clearly and got to work replacing my broken disposal. He had a replacement disposal of higher quality in his truck, replaced the broken one quickly and cleanly and explained how it works, warranty, etc. Caccia always does great work and always takes pains to leave no mess behind.  Fantastic as always.<//Review>

Joseph of Caccia plumbing provided excellent and high quality service. He was punctual. He was very professional and friendly. Polite and dedicated to getting the job done perfectly. He is a skilled and talented plumbing expert who explained the details and scope of the work. We felt incredibly comfortable with his assessment and trusted him with the quote. The results of the replacement of the water heater and the many upgrades and additional work were beyond our expectations. We are grateful to have our hot water back on so quickly! We highly recommend Joseph and Caccia plumbing.< /Text>

I had a fantastic experience with Joseph from James Caccia Plumbing! It was easy and fast to make an appointment, and the date was very soon after the request. Joseph switched out the bowl quickly and made sure to tidy up the whole area after the job was done. I highly recommend James Caccia for any plumbing needs!!</Text>

<review>Caccia has been my go-to for plumbing needs for about 7 years and my loyalty to them is because they always deliver quality, friendly, professional, timely service.  Today was no exception.  I had a "moaning" toilet and Ofa patiently worked to diagnose the problem. I told him that I was interested in getting any necessary work done right away, in case we have any rollback of COVID orders.  After discussion and an estimate, I had some long-term work done along with the fix for the immediate toilet problem.  In addition to a "no-fuss" appointment, Ofa left everything clean and took the time to walk me through the job when he was finished.  I couldn't be more pleased.<//review>< Rate>

<Text>I have used Caccia several times in the past, but Morgan and his associate Nate provided the most outstanding service I ever received during our kitchen mini-remodel. Everyone we interacted with at Caccia was professional and extremely patient while I asked repeated questions about the process. But Morgan brought customer service to a whole new level with never being satisfied with anything less than absolute perfection. I will not hesitate to use Caccia again and recommend to everyone I know.</Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

We were pleased with the work done for us by Caccia Plumbing.
We needed a new hot water heater and they were able to fit us into their schedule quickly.
Dino did a great job of installing and testing the heater.
He took his time to make sure that we understood how the system worked and was very professional.
Excellent service and quality of work.< /review>

Morgan and teddy, from Caccia plumbing changed 2 tankless water heaters at my home. It was a big job, as they had to redo a lot of pipe work to make it work . They completed on time, left the place spotless. Would definitely recommend them, I am very happy with their work.</text>

Anthony arrived on time and quick assessed m situation providing a couple different options.  He didn’t rush my decision making as I was trying to get in touch with my husband.  He was very detailed in explaining both options. We opted for the less expensive option although may not have been the best long term.  He also gave me a $25 discount!  He not only did the job but went above and did extra cleaning inside the toilet system.  I appreciated him getting the job done same day!< /Review>

Hi

Moe came out to estimate the cost of replacing our sewer lateral.  Unfortunately it will require a 12' deep hole so it is beyond what your company is willing to do.  Still Moe was helpful and especially credible.  He was generous with his time and spent a few extra minutes giving me an education on what a proper job should include.  I knew most of it but a couple things about the connection to the main were news.  This was great to learn and will be helpful in selecting a contractor and making sure the job is done as well as it can be for a lasting repair.  I'm sorry Moe will not be doing the job, we really liked him.

Best to Moe, sincerely, Jim parks< /Text>

The best experience I've had with a plumbing company. James came out on time (I was late) and waited for me. He crawled under my house through muddy water to understand the issue. He was careful where he walked to avoid getting any mud or dirt on our patio.
After understanding the issue, he walked me through the different options all of which brought his company no business. I had called them out to help with water pooling under our house and thought I would need to get a sub pump installed. James helped identify that the water was most likely coming from underground and that the best solution would be to address it at the high point in the backyard to prevent water from saturating the soil in the first place. He gave me a list of recommended companies that could help with different options and typed up everything in an email to make it really easy to read through.
Scheduling with these guys was a breeze. We did everything over email and worked through a couple reschedules. Their team responded to me immediately and respected my request to work through email vs via phone. All the investigation work was completely free of charge and James in particular was one of the nicest guys I've worked with for something like this. Genuine, friendly, honest and has me wondering if there is something else I can find to give him some business. He wouldn't even accept my tip!
Highly recommended and I hope they know how amazing James is.</Text>

Great experience with Caccia. Straightforward to schedule appointments and their techs showed up in the correct time window. Nate and Joe did a great job. They were professional, knowledgeable, clearly knew what they were doing, worked quietly, quickly and efficiently, cleaned the job site up afterwards. Highly recommended.< /review>

This is not to criticize the plumber or his work, which went very smoothly and professionally, but the management of the job. I do expect more for a 90-minute appointment that cost $1,300, about half what my last medical procedure cost and that involved a hospital, a nurse, a surgical assistant and a surgeon.<//Review><Date>1566062481135</Date>< user_id>

We've been having water pressure issues in our house.  Our kitchen is on the opposite side of the house and gets NO pressure.  Very frustrating!!!  We've had 2 other plumbers look at it and say that it was because of the distance from the water source to our kitchen.  Nate found the problem (actually 3 issues) and along with Andre,  got our kitchen water pressure better than it's been since we bought the house.< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I am consistently impressed with Caccia plumbing.  Every time I have had them come fix whatever is currently not working in my home my expectations are exceeded.

I currently have a toilet that is only 20 years old (it sounds young to me) but it needs to be replaced.  Although it doesn't sound complicated, it was.  Andrei took a look at the situation and was able to offer a few suggestions including things I never would have considered.  He did so in a very professional yet friendly manner and when he left I felt confident the problem would be fixed correctly.

It doesn't matter if the problem is big or small, the outcome is excellent.  It is clear that the level of professionalism comes from the top for each employee I interact with his patient, thoughtful and knows what he/she is doing.  Knowing when I call Caccia the problem will get fixed - is worth its weight in gold.  I cannot recommend them enough.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Nate, was courteous and knowledgable. He quickly explained what we needed to do to fix our kitchen sink, and gave me very detailed quotes with several options. Unfortunately for us, the amount of work that needs to be done in order to truly fix the problem isn't worth the cost, as we're planning on doing a gut renovation of the kitchen in the next year or so. Nate completely understood our not wanting to invest that much now, and didn't make me feel like I wasted his time or put any pressure on me. I will definitely call Caccia Plumbing when we need to do work in the future.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Been using Caccia for years both in Belmont and Hillsborough and have been very happy with their work. They are professional, good communicators, seem to enjoy and take pride in their work and on various jobs, their plumbers have worked well together as a team to problem shoot and get job done. Moe is thoughtful, explains scope of work clearly when coming to assess problem, is patient with questions and will even follow up with any question or issue if needed. I also love that Caccia helps the community and  has a summer internship program for high school students interested in checking out the profession. Cost wise they may be a little on the higher side but you get what you pay for: quality plumbing work and peace of mind!</Text>< username>

This is actually Darlene Angeli in San Bruno.  Liz came to look at a Kitchen Faucet.  She was excellent.  However, I have been very disappointed.  I feel as customer I am being totally ignored.  I have called and e mailed to ask about what I felt was an extreme charge of $425.00 for just adjusting the float on the kitchen faucet.  I have yet to get a response from anyone even thought Sue said she would get back to me.  No e mails, no calls.  I just wanted to understand what seemed like an extreme charge for such a small project.  I read on your web page about excellent customer service.  I own a small business and I would not treat my customers in this manner.  All I was asking for was someone to respond to my question.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Our great experience started w Nate who came out to assess our crawlspace/pipes situation. Not only did he provide us with three proposals (based on cost), but he was available for follow up as many questions the next week as we needed.

On the day of service, Jack and Teddy were exemplary - completely professional and tireless workers who went about the full day with minimal disruption to our daily routine. They were responsive to every little question we had and at the end cleaned up around the workspaces thoroughly (which should be table stakes but is not always the case!!). Could not have been more satisfied with their service that day.

The only concern I had when they first arrived was the impression that they hadn’t been completely briefed by Nate as to all the details of the job. They did call him then and then and checked the work order thoroughly. This made me believe Jack’s assurance that everything would fall into place once they got under the house. All good on that front in the end!

Despite their reputation (from other plumbing companies, i might add!) for being pricey, Caccia’s proposal came in at around the middle among the 5 plumbing companies we had come to the house. Paired with their unbelievable Warranty Program - well worth the price, seriously! - we feel really confident about the value they provided and will be our plumbing company going forward.

At the office Jen the ’work manager’ (maybe?) was always available for questions and called me back promptly if on another line. Finally, the infrastructure that being a larger, more established affords them was really impressive,  eg texts with the employee’s picture!!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

On December 18
I had an appointment to have Caccia Plumbing to run a camera in my sewer line.
Nate came out and ran the camera and explained as he was working the camera.
We saw some problems with the line and Nate gave me an estimate on replacement of the line.
He answered all my questions to satisfaction.
I signed a contract to replace the line.
All I have to do is wait for the start date.
All the people at Caccia Plumbing are Super Stars in my book.</review>

Joe from Caccia plumbing did a terrific job replacing our water heater and bringing the system up to current code.Joe also added improvements to allow for cold water if the heater must be off. Very professional and neat! Clean up too. We have had other services from Caccia and expect future needs will be from them.
Great attitude from all . Many thanks<//review>

We had a number of plumbing issues: leaky sinks, weak pressure in shower heads, a broken kitchen sink and disposal unit. We were told by numerous plumbers in the past that the kitchen sink disposal unit could not be fixed due to the angle of the piping behind the custom cabinetry. A fix would require breaking through the cabinetry.

Caccia came and fixed all the minor issues we had on their first visit. Joseph Stevenson and his colleague Joe worked carefully and efficiently to solve all the minor issues.

Joseph Stevenson worked on the main kitchen sink and disposal unit. He was able to do what prior plumbers said could not be done. He worked in a tight space behind the cabinets by only breaking through the back wall and leaving everything else in tact. He rerouted the piping, replaced the disposal unit and installed replacement parts that were out of warranty but still sent to us for free (Joseph recommended we contact the manufacturer which saved us a lot on parts). Once he got everything working, he replaced the back wall of the cabinet and cleaned everything to leave no trace of the work. Amazing!

While Caccia runs a bit more expensive than other plumbing companies, our experience was exceptional, and we thought we got what we paid for. Joseph was extremely experienced and customer service oriented, respecting our home as if it was his own. Definitely highly recommend Caccia and specifically, Joseph Stevenson.</Text>

<Review>James Caccia Plumbing gave me one of the best customer service experiences that I can remember in a long time.  Joe Sullivan is the plumber who came to my home and was very honest, sincere and professional in assessing the plumbing needs in my bathroom.  It was a pleasant experience and if I need plumbing services again, I will call these guys first and ask for Joe if he's available.<//Review>< pics>

Joe Sullivan is honest. Looking at our leaking shower, it was unclear if the problem is plumbing related or a sealing issue. He gave us an assignment to determine if it is a sealing issue, since this would save us $. No gain for him though. This is the second time we work with him and we really appreciate his working ethics.</Review>

<text>Liz did an awesome job bringing the kitchen plumbing in our 1923 home into this century. It was a huge project going into the wall behind the kitchen sink, reconfiguring the p-trap, modern piping, adding a disposal, new fixtures, etc.

Ofa took care of some laundry room updates to replace galvanized pipe with copper.

Also, our home remained spotless even with rain all day and the plumbers going in and out.

Definitely would recommend Caccia for large or small jobs.< /text>< pictures>

Our Nursery School had an unexpected object in the sewer line and the toilets backed up. I called Caccia. Susan and Moe realized that 24 toddlers with no bathrooms was an emergency. Moe came in an hour, assessed the situation and Rene, Teren and Herman worked very hard to get us up and running. They have the equipment and the know-how and we are very grateful. Thank you, Moe and crew.< /review>

<Review>Moe let us know he was on the way and arrived on time, which to me is a huge plus.
He listened to our explanation of the problem we were having with our sewer line (roots).  He put a camera down our clean out, showed us what the line looked like and explained the implications of what we were seeing.  He was very patient and truly wanted to make certain we understood what the camera showed.
Moe then explained several options to address the issues we saw.  Again, he was very patient with our questions and made certain we understood the options.
We felt that Moe know what he was taking about and left us with the knowledge to make a decision.</Review><pics>None</pics><Name>Frederick Long<//Name></record></dataset><record>

I called back and the person who answered the phone said I needed to go into the email they sent me to change or cancel... I asked if she could just do it for me and she said she “only answers phones, she can’t do anything”.  She asked if I wanted to leave a message.. and that she answers phones so customers don’t get an answering machine... which is exactly what she is!

I just told her to leave a message for whoever she needed to and cancelled... there are plenty of good plumbers that you can just call and talk to a person that can change your appointment.

She needs to answer the phone, “your two star service starts with me”!<//text>< pics>

Moe and Tony did a video analysis of my sewer pipe.  They were extremely thorough and accurate - providing a video, written report, and giving me clear next steps to fix identified problems.  All in all, I would definitely recommend them to anyone needing plumbing work.<//Review>

<Time>1558128835800<//Time><rating>5</rating><Review>SUPERB service and professionalism!  What started as a small task to change a faucet, ended up involving more complicated structural issues that involved common pipes in our condo property.  Liz was very thorough and explained each available option.  Tyrone assisted Liz on day 2 and was equally thorough.  After dealing with the HOA and all the haggling that involved,  Liz reported back to work on day 3 with her manager Joseph.  Joseph worked with the HOA manager every step of the way, and  in so doing relieved a tremendous amount of stress.  In the end, the work product  was excellent, better than the original construction of our condo.  We are so pleased!  This is the 3rd time we have used Caccia Plumbing and highly recommend their services.  They are courteous, HONEST, (Explaining options....never "padding" extra tasks to bill). When considering a plumber, they are the best and get the job done right!!  Thank you!!<//Review>< pics>

<review>Jack Hoyer is friendly and knowledgeable and didn’t pressure us right away to do the work. Our washing machine is connected to utility sink, several plumbers have come out to put “band aid” on the backup problem without really fixing the real issue. Jack came out and told us truthfully that the pipe grading and connection wasn’t proper. One of pipes was leaking. We were initially shocked by the price but considering how much the other plumbers were charging per visits. We knew once Caccia plumbing fixed the problem, we are taken care of. Very hard to find an honest knowledgeable, trustworthy plumber. Thank you, Caccia and thank you, Jack.<//review><GmapID>0x808f9dc3deec3739:0xa6fe770e5dd29c48</GmapID><Rate>5</Rate>< pics>

<Review>Your representative, Moe, was absolutely first class. We asked Caccia to give us an estimate for replacing our lateral. Moe inspected the video of our lateral, the manhole from the main street, and the surface where our lateral is buried. He then provided us information regarding responsibility for replacing the lateral, connecting to the main sewer, and replacement of the main sewer. He then described the different types of main sewer lines that the City could use to replace our main, and how each option could affect whether the homeowner or the City is responsible for repairing what appears to be a leak at the connection of our lateral to the main. The leak has caused a sink hole, and will likely continue to get worse with sewer has contaminated our soil. Moe finally admitted that replacing our lateral is likely not suitable for Caccia, because the connection to the main is likely 10 feet deep, where the scope of work involved is beyond Caccia's ability. Thank you Caccia for operating such a professional, family owned business.</Review>< Pics>

Caccia Plumbing did an excellent job repairing two separate plumbing issues that recently impacted our home. Moe from Caccia did a great job in both instances of diagnosing the issue and clearly explaining how they could be fixed. Christian from Caccia was very professional in executing the work and keeping me informed of the progress. Caccia did great work and I will not hesitate to call them again with any future plumbing issues.<//Text>

<review>We've used Caccia Plumbing several times and have always been very satisfied with their work and professionalism.  I've just had them out for a couple of issues in two of our bathrooms which required them to come back several times (for parts that had to be ordered and installed).  Each time, they called ahead of time to confirm, and were *always* prompt.  I was especially impressed with that.  Most importantly, they did the work thoroughly.  Joseph S. was easy to work with, explained everything before he did the work, and very professional.  I would recommend James Caccia Plumbing to anyone.
BTW, even though my last name is Caccia, we are *no* relation to the company -- you can trust this review.  :)

Updated 9/9/2019:
Just had Caccia Plumbing out here for a different problem with our kitchen sink.  Lucas came out, diagnosed the problem, and worked diligently to make sure it was fixed correctly.  Joseph came back out to look at it with him, and the two continued to demonstrate the high level of professionalism we've come to expect from Caccia Plumbing.  We remain fans!< /review><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

We have a very bad experience with this company.  When we asked for an estimate for our kitchen pipe leaking problem, we were told it was free.  After Nate came to our house, he went into the crawl space, then he immediately came right back out and said it was a mess in the crawl space, he advised us to hire a professional restoration company to clean it up first before he can see the pipe problem.  Therefore, he can not give us an estimate.  He said his service for that date was $197.00.   Then we received a charge bill from our credit company that he actually charged us $425.00.    We called the company and talked to the manager, he then sent us a refund check for $140.00.  So, we ended up paying $285 for their half hour service and did not even have an estimate.
We called another company to do the same estimate the next day and the one hour work with a real written estimate was only cost us $49.00.
I suggest all customer to be very careful to do business with this company.  Found out all the hidden cost before you have them do the job for you.     We spent $285.00 for  a lesson learnt.<//Review>

<Text>Good service, but way overpriced! They charged $3000 to fix the water pipe coming into our house that was broken by tree roots several months ago. When we had another leak, they estimated $3400 -- we went with someone else who completed the job for $1200.<//Text>< rate>

From my experience, I would recommend this company highly.   The training manager, Jeff Wise, installed a new boiler for my heating system and  worked hard to get the whole system working efficiently.  The installation was immediately approved by the building inspector.  Jeff was very capable and knowledgeable, and he was most professional and pleasant to work with.  I have a feeling of confidence that this company stands behind their work.< /review>

Very professional company. They are very smart about how they do the work. I have a p trap leakage problem. They wore shoe cover and bring their own carpet to work on. After working, they even clean the working space for you. They did not even charge me before I am fully 100% Satisfied with their work. I highly recommend this company. Especially Joseph!

I have been using James Caccia Plumbing for over two years, and will keep coming back for their services. The employees are professional, efficient and polite. I called on January 2nd, 2019 to make an appointment for January 3rd, unfortunately I missed their phone call about telling me they are coming, and they had to move to next client. But they called me back one more time after couple of hours to see if I am still available on January 3rd. I told them yes, and they came, get my bath drain fixed within 30 minutes. The price is reasonable.< /text>

Caccia Plumbing is a great company to do business with. They charge a fair price for the value and peace of mind they provide and if they make a mistake they take care of it professionally and quickly. We had a problem, (hey, they happen) and Caccia couldn't have been more service oriented in taking care of it and standing behind their work.
If you have any plumbing needs that you want to have taken care of by professional who take care of their customers and their work, you won't do better than Caccia. PS They are also good corporate citizens, participating in their community.
Who else would you rather work with?<//Review>

We had a drain line problem with our washing machine. Ofa from Caccia Plumbing diagnosed the cause of the problem and had it fixed so our drain was good as new. I am an engineer so I am very appreciative of quality work by very knowledgeable people. Yayyy now we can do that pile of laundry. 5 stars for Ofa and Caccia Plumbing.<//text>

I highly recommend Liz Gustafson from Caccia Plumbing.  She was knowledgeable, professional, straight-forward, courteous, and above all, punctual!  I had the same problem with my water heater within 2 months after it was fixed.  I called the plumber who did the original repair but never got a return call.  Then, I called another plumber who strung us along with empty promises.  Finally, I called Caccia Plumbling because of all the positive reviews I’ve read and Liz Gustafson showed up at my house within the promised timeframe, showed me what the problems were, explained in detail what she would do to fix the problems and how much time it would take. She showed up the next morning to put in a new water heater and finished the job within the promised timeframe.

If you want plumbing done right and quickly, call Caccia Plumbling. I will never call another plumber again!  Caccia Plumbling also offers Care Club membership, which gives you discounts, priority service, annual inspection for your water heater, plus other valuable preventative maintenance at a fraction of what these services cost.  Totally worth it for peace of mind!< /Text>

Jim M. replaced a leaky pressure regulator just outside our garage wall. The slow leak had created quite a deep puddle of water, and he was very careful not to leave a mess of mud on our composite walkway. The complex new copper piping needed to raise the regulator up into the proper position looks like a work of art. We were also pleased that the company put us on their wait list for an expedited visit, which meant our problem was fixed by Thursday noon instead of the following Monday. Aside from his excellent handiwork, Jim was very clear and articulate in his explanations and answers to our questions.<//Text>

Caccia Plumbing did not arrive within the agreed upon time window of 9-10am. I called the office at 10am, and was told to hang on while they reached out for an ETA. Caccia Plumbing hung up on me without notice, but did return my call shortly afterwards with an update that someone was on their way.

Once Caccia arrived, they were extremely professional and knowledgeable. They inspected the sewer lateral and found a possible cause for my plumbing issues. They offered suggestions as well as quotes for various repairs

For this experience nearly 5 stars, however the lack of timliness brings them down to 4. Had they proactively reached out to me to inform me of the delayed arrival they would receive a 5.< /Text>

I found Caccia plumber Ofa  V very informative on  the nature of the needed work and pricing. All terms were clear when work began. After the work was done he made sure that the water lines for the washing machine and adjacent utility tub were clear. He replaced a worn plug for easier future access.  I also appreciated a call to confirm the appointment. The price for the work was reasonable and a senior discount was honored. I highly recommend Caccia Plumbing .

I called Caccia Plumbing with a clogged double kitchen sink in the evening, and left a message to request service the next day.  I received a call the next morning for between 12:00 and 2:00.  Carlos arrived on time; he was personable, calm, knowledgeable, and worked consistently to resolve the problem.  It took a little over two hours to clear the drain.  They charge by the job, not by the hour.  Carlos was great throughout.  I am older, and could not empty out many products under my sink.  He cleared it all out, cleaned up any trace of mess, and returned all products under sink.  I am very pleased with Caccia Plumbing and Carlos!</review>

We highly recommend Caccia Plumbing for their prompt, friendly and professional service they provided us on 3/13/15. Nate Watt provided the service to clear the Exterior Sewer/Septic Service Line using a special Hydro Unit. Our service window was 8:00AM - 10:00AM and he arrived at 8:15AM with a phone call 30 minutes prior to arrival. His analysis of the problem was quick with a clear explanation and solved the the problem expertly. We appreciate very much how James Caccia Plumbing and their employees treated us and our plumbing problem< /text>

We have been clients of James Caccia Plumbing for almost 30 years.  Just replaced a 28 year old dishwasher and again are grateful for the expert and efficient work of this company.  Anthony and his team provide great service and followup....this is a 5 star recommendation from our family.< /Text>

Tyrone came on time at beginning of window that was given to me which I
appreciated.  He explained where the leak from kitchen fixture was coming from and
put in a new part.  Also my garbage disposal went out and he said it was all
rusty so he installed a new one for me and was done little over an hour.  He checked
thoroughly to make sure  there were no leaks.  He did a great job!</Text>

<Review>James Murray’s visit to my home to fix leaky faucets and handle some other major plumbing issues reflects the exceptional quality service provided by James Caccia Plumbing Service.   He readily explained what needed to be done in layman terms enabling me to make an informed decision as to what would work best.  I appreciated his taking the time to give ma a better understanding of the problem & repair options   This service was a truly engaging/satisfying one resulting from his professional competency and superior technical expertise.  I would not even think of using another plumbing company since experience with James Cacao Plumbing is matchless.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808f9dc3deec3739:0xa6fe770e5dd29c48<//gmapID></record>

Angelo from Caccia repaired a gas line leak under our house today. He was very knowledgeable, personable and took the time to explain our plumbing needs as well as other observations about our home. I also appreciated that he explained the entire process of this repair from beginning to end, shared how and why he was conducting pressure tests and provided the results of the pressure test to me. I was surprised to learn we were losing 4 lbs of pressure per minute!

Caccia's price was a little higher than another quote I got, but the work was thorough, honest and I can sleep well tonight knowing the leak was repaired same day. Angelo basically treated our home like his own.

Update 2016. Still LOVE these guys. Have you ever hugged a plumber? I did today. We had a major clog in our sewage pipes that two other plumbers couldn't clear. These guys cleared it in an hour and install a new toilet. Tyrone and Ruben were so considerate, kept me updated on the progress and just did a great job. Very professional but personable. Thank you Caccia!

2019 another great experience today. They replaced most of the plumbing in my home (115 year old plumbing). These are my go to pros.< /text>

I called to repair a sewage backup at my home, and was able to get a same day appointment.  Ofa was the plumber who showed up, and he handled the job very professionally and did an excellent job.  He first used the snake to clear some roots that had grown in, and then used a video camera to make sure everything was cleared.  When he found more roots, he went back in with the snake to completely clear the pipes, even though this added nearly an hour to the amount of work that would be done.  I rate him very highly, and would recommend him to anyone looking for plumbing services.</review>

I normally do not post reviews, but Santiago was just too good.

He came over on New Years Eve, fixed everything quickly and cleanly, and even was great with my kids who wanted to learn about what he was doing.

Strong recommendation here< /review>

I was thoroughly satisfied with the service I received today from Jim M. at Caccia.  Our kitchen drain was clogged and our garbage disposal needed replacing.  It turned out to be a complicated job, but Jim remained calm and confident, and did a fantastic job.  Very friendly and extremely competent.  Arrived at the earliest point in the window (by the way, a one hour window is amazing!!), which is super helpful for busy parents.  Kept a messy job very tidy.  Explained parts and labor required and the cost upfront.  Had everything he needed to complete the job on the first visit.  All-around professional, and I will call Caccia whenever we need a plumber.< /Text>

<review>Not a stellar experience.  Requested estimate for the following:  repair 2 leaking faucets, snake slow bathroom drain, and repair loose shower handle.  Two leaking faucets repaired-NO; repair loose shower handle-NO; snake drain-YES.  1 item completed for $451.  Seems a little excessive to snake a drain.  Also, given estimate to replace 1 faucet at cost of $500.  Again, seems a little excessive.  Had to call to get estimate and repair receipts and it appears that admin staff did not copy my email address correctly.  If I knew it was going to be a million dollars to come to my property, I would have gone elsewhere.< /review><Response>None< /Response><name>Caesar Batalao</name><gmap_id>0x808f9dc3deec3739:0xa6fe770e5dd29c48< /gmap_id>< user>

Caccia plumbing came the day I called to repair the washing machine drain. The night before water had come gushing out of the machine. The service is always excellent!<//review>

< review>
I called the office of Caccia Plumbing to set up an appointment for a clogged drain. I spoke with a very pleasant receptionist who took down my information. A plumber named Santiago came to my home. He was very polite,  well mannered and knowledgeable. He introduced himself and handed me his business card and went to work and quickly resolved the problem. He also took precautions to lay down protection as not to damage any tile work in the bathroom. After he completed his job I asked him a quick question about another issue that was unrelated to the clogged drain. He quickly went under the sink and made an adjustment. My problem was solved !!! He was so nice to take a few minutes of his busy schedule. This is great customer service !!! If I ever have plumbing issues in the future I will call Caccia Plumbing.</review>

<review>Ifran and Dave arrived early today to fix my clogged sink. First, they spent a few minutes troubleshooting and explained what was wrong.  There were 3 possible solutions with estimates and I chose which one I wanted.  The work was done efficiently and my kitchen area was as tidy after as when they began!  I couldn't have asked for 2 nicer more professional individuals.

We engaged a contractor to fix a leaky kitchen faucet. After spending two days the contractor gave up and left a big mess and no water in the kitchen.
We called James Caccia Plumbing service in desperation and they immediately sent one of their plumbers. The plumber ( Joseph) educated us on what the issue was and what needed to be done to fix the issue and provided us with an estimate. Joseph fixed the issue in couple of hours. We have interfaced with a lot of plumbers in the past but Joseph from Caccia Plumbing is a top notch plumber with excellent communication skills and a true professional !
We highly recommend James Caccia Plumbing for your plumbing needs.

<Review>The wife and I bought a renovated home and endured tankless water heater issues for months -- water would start hot and inexplicably go cold. We tried six different plumbers before James Caccia plumbing but got nowhwere; no one we called even knew the brand or how to service them. James Caccia plumbing came in the day after we called, diagnosed it and fixed it in less than two hours. Super nice. Super professional. Super knowledgeable. 10/10 will use them again.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

We had an overflow pipe which  needed to be cleaned out.  Joseph was the service field manager who came to my  house.  He was very professional.  He provided me with an estimate before the work was done and explained the possible outcomes of his work.  Fortunately, we just needed the pipe to be snaked, but if there were other problems I was aware of what the next steps would be.  He was very friendly and even cleaned up the yucky overflow area after the problem was fixed.  He completed the work in about an hour and I was extremely pleased with the service.</review>

<Review>Highly Recommend Caccia Plumbing!! We live in Burlingame and love the fact that we were contacted regularly by Susan to be informed of our plumbers arrival. Our Awesome Plumber was Tyrone Bolds! Tyrone is the man! He fixed our leaky kitchen pipes and replaced our garbage disposal in just over an hour. And cleaned up after himself too. Love the new and quiet garbage disposal he recommended and installed. Even provided an 8 year warranty on the disposal and 1 year service warranty too! There are over 166 Awesome Google Reviews about this company compared to any other Plumbing companies around the area. Appreciate your awesome service Susan and Tyrone! Mahalo Caccia Plumbing!!

Carlos T. did a great job unclogging the line from our kitchen--he was thorough, he clearly explained what he was doing and why, and he checked multiple times whether we had any questions or concerns. We also asked him for an estimate for putting in an additional cleanout. He came up with several possible options and clearly explained the tradeoffs between the different options.< /review>

Had Caccia come over to fix a leaky shower faucet this morning and it was incredibly smooth and seamless. We called two days earlier in the week and scheduled them to come by between 8-9am. Ofa arrived at almost exactly 8:30.

He came in and I showed him the problem with the shower. We then walked around to shutoff the water and take a look at our water heater. He was super informative the entire time and made sure to take the time to help me understand what exactly he was looking at and why.

He then spent some time replacing the parts in the faucet that needed fixing and went over each step.

Ofa was in and out  with all the fixes in place and had a happy customer in a little over an hour.

I highly recommend Caccia Plumbing and would ask to have Ofa be the technician. He was super professional and courteous.</text>

I have been using Caccia Plumbing for over 20 years.  I wouldn't use anyone else!  Office staff is very friendly, field folks are amazing and all work is always conducted in a very professional manner.  They are the best!  Ofa V.  just serviced my SubZero icemaker line.  He is a great representative of Caccia Plumbing. Thank you to all!</Review>

Yesterday, Ofa helped me with a plan for a new water heater.  He was fabulous!  He was thorough, thoughtful and very helpful.  Additionally, he was very careful regarding COVID concerns.

THANK YOU OFA!< /Text>

OFA VEIMAU does super quality work, and extremely professional the entire time he spent replacing the air gap & drain hose to the sink, along with rebuilding the two toilet tanks in the bathrooms!  Very Happy with his service, and will tell everyone I know to call OFA.  Highly recommend!  Thank You OFA!!!</Review>

Oct. 6, 2017:  Very professional and courteous service.  Ofa V. fixed our plumbing problem and met our expectations.  My wife and I  highly recommend Caccia Plumbing for home owners  in the Burlingame Hills and Hillsborough neighborhood.
