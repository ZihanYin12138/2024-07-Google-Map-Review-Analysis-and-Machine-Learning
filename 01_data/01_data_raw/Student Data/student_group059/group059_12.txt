< review>
They just opened rally by wienersnitzetchels on waterman in San Bernardino.  I was so pleased that it was a walk up like the hot dog spot by it. It got one star because they didn't let me sit down like hot dog place by it. Its silly they have seats that are spaced out too. The food was good in which I had a chicken sandwich and fries with a strawberry ice cream cone and lemonade as well as funnel cake fries which were so good. They lack on their condiments in which I had to go home to enjoy their food fully. The ice cream cone was a nice whip and very flavorful.</review>

Oh don't get me started by Rally's man that spot old man that spot they have the most amazing fries and their hamburgers are up to par and well the phone drinks are just fountain drinks so don't expect nothing just spectacular about their drinks cuz they're just like McDonald's and Jack in the boxes and everybody else's but the fries and the burgers are the best that I've tasted in a while and again the customer service on a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 100 they are just wow that's really all I can say<//Review>

I reluctantly gave 3 stars, here's why.. the drive thru turn.. who designed that? I drive a sports car and had to back up twice to make the turn. I ordered 3 spicy chicken sandwiches.  I thought it was just me, till someone else said what I thought. Did they cook those with floor cleaner? That was the worst! The good of my experience, as long as the line was, it kept moving pretty quickly. The employees were accurate and friendly. Needless to say, as excited I was to go there for a first time, I was pretty disappointed.
I do want to try a few other items you have on your menu. I am still keeping a open mind, I'm sure I'll have a better experience next time.</Review>

I wanted to give this place a zero to be honest. I walked in today 5/5/2020 a little after 3:30pm to get something to eat. I understand with everything that is going on places are closed but you would have people come inside for an interview than let a hungry truck driver buy some food. Thank you for all you do and the way that you treat the people that bring the materials that you need to sell to make money.<//Review>

Was my family's first time trying it. Fries were good and the burger was good. Unfortunately always double check your food. We noticed we were missing a drink and a sunday and thought that was it. Unfortunately we noticed we were missing more fries from our meals once we got home. Service was pretty quick for a packed drive through and the employees were nice. Just double check your food to make sure you have everything.<//review>

Ordered a big Buford burger and requested no ketchup or mustard. Once I got home 15 mins later I noticed my burger had mustard. Drove back and politely requested a refund since at that point I had lost my appetite. I understand mistakes happen but I can't stand when staff is rude acting like its the customer's fault for a mistake they made. For the inconvenience I asked the manager Erica is she could refund my total $24.50 or at least my combo that had the mistake and she said no that only the burger could be refunded. I ended getting around $4 back. Not even the drive of 2 trips, the long wait in line, and the horrible service provided. Will definitely not be back. And as someone who has worked in the fast food industry, I highly recommend everyone be retrained because both times that I have gone I was provided with terrible service. If you don't want to work, I'm sure someone will feel blessed to have a job you take for granted.</review>< pictures>

<review>Um going 2 keep this polite as possible ive worked n the food services for fast food i understand but when u have only one car (remember i said one car) so it should be no excuses for how you mess up the order more three times. It was only three people in the car how do you mess up this order five different times honestly everyone that was working at (1:36pm on 8/5/2020 needs to be fired) i have been a rally's lover since i was a kid back in 97 in long beach im very upset & will never return (no stars)</review><Gmap_id>0x80c34de0c1a64e7d:0x33d18d49d10d9dbf</Gmap_id></record>

This has to be one of the worst fast food restaurants I've ever been to. They're extremely slow that it would make me never want to eat at a Rally's, especially when I'm hungry. I haven't tried their food I've just came to pick up food for someone else but I'd just eat else where tbh.< /Text>

Couldn’t wait to go here. Once we arrived it was horrible customer service! People before us where upset because their order wasn’t ready. We received all our food expect one item. Had to wait until we left just to get our food. Other customers where upset over the service. one customer started to yell to give everybody their money back. The supervisor was unruly with the customer and refused to give the money back to us and other customers. Experience was horrible! Highly disappointed! This establishment won’t be open very much longer if they continue to give slow service and bad customer service.<//Text>

Ordered a Fry Lover's Burger without buns. The fries were cold and the cheese wasn't melted! Also the customer service was bad and I was the only car in line! Compared to the other Rally's I've been to, this by far is the worst one. I would be disappointed to see this Rallys leave Rialto do to poor customer service.</Text>

Last time I was here, service was slow. Food was good, but the drive thru was extremely busy. Too long of a line too wait.
My family and I decided to go inside. Even with going inside the service was slow.
This time drive thru moved extremely fast. Food tasted even better than last time. Not sure if management has changed, but shout out to the major improvements made!!! Cashier and GM were very friendly. I will be filling out the survey on the back of the receipt and be coming back! Consider me sold! 🙏🏻</Review>< pics>

<review>It was an okay experience, the inside is a bit chaotic and busy, the chicken sandwiches they have tasted a bit better than McDonald's and the Fry lover fries were served in a medium cup.

The tables and chairs were a bit dirty while I was there and you'll probably will have to ask someone to clean them.

I probably would come back probably just only for the Fries as they are well seasoned.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< name>

<rate>4</rate><review>I never knew Rallys was a nationwide chain. This gave me memories of the time I spend my summer with my relatives in the San Diego County town of Ramona back in 2001. The one in Ramona is no longer there, but there is one in Escondido. Who knew, I would eat at Rallys again a few decades later. This Rallys opened not too long ago. This one is a full restaurant with drive thru, the one in Ramona and Escondido is a drive thru with a few outdoor picnic tables.

I ordered a Big Bufford. Its was pretty good. It had a little bit of In N Out flavor, but its own thing. The one I ate in Ramona was the regular hamburger which had a sesame seed bun. The fries tasted like seasoned curly fries. My sister ate a Spicy Chicken sandwich, which I will try next time.

Overall the food was good, decent variety and taste. Prices are reasonable, the inside was pretty simplistic. The dining area could be expanded as in a more open floor plan, more tables because I could see it getting crowded during busy times. The taste of the food, the service, and the prices is what I can see bringing people back.</text>

It was real good! My family and I were the only ones inside to eat. The staff was super nice and courteous. Went on Wednesday which we thought was gunna be packed but it wasn't. Food took 10 minutes which is cool because you don't wait long. Yeah it is next to the train tracks but at least it's getting exposure for others to see there's one closer than driving all the way to L.A. Rialto is really coming along with it's fast food food places and restaurants. Thanks for the meal Rally staff 👍<//Text>

The food is great! But the customer service definitely needs to be improved that lady manager is very rude I was in the Drive-Thru and had asked for 4 cups of ice and mind you I had a large order but when she saw me pouring the ice in a bigger cup she said she could only give me two and then shut the window on me.</text>

<Text>Was really excited about Rally's coming to Rialto. Just to find out that the service is horrible. And they don't have the full menu up in the drive thru. It's probably best to go inside.<//Text>< time>

🔥👌 customer service on point, even though they had credit card issue. She let me know. The food was soooo bomb! I got the hot wings, mozzarella sticks, baconzilla and no it doesn't taste like no damn mc Donald's. Oh and they fasho got the best fries ever! The burgers don't have that weird flavor that Wendy's has either. Patties were not flat like a lot of these burger place.< /review>

<Review>The drive thru had only one car at the order screen in front of me and they had him wait for at least 20 mins before they took his order...all 3 cars behind me left so I ended up parking..Went inside and there was only a couple people eating no line...I asked if it was going to be a long wait and the employee said he couldn't tell me..so I left.</Review>< GmapID>

So happy you're here in Rialto if it wasn't for my son who works for BRC and did the install I wouldn't have known it was here in Rialto. My food was delicious and taste exactly like the one in L.A.. My only suggestion is that they clean the windows. Welcome  to Rialto Rally's</text>

I was looking forward to this place, was very excited about going to Rally's,  but it was truly a disappointment , they were missing a lot of items including ice, can you imagine having a drink without ice?but yet they charged you the same price, not good at all. I'm not going back to this place,  absolutely not like the one in Glendale Ca.</Review>

Every time I have had to call, I have sat on hold for a minimum of 1 to 4 hours, only to have my call "dropped" just I finally reached a live person!.
My advice to anyone who has to call this call center; prior to disclosing why you are calling, make sure you have the person who answers take down your name and call back number. Then get their commitment that they will call you back in the likely event there is a disconnect. Otherwise, if your reason for calling is too complicated or requires. more of an effort from them than just basic data entry (like updating an address), there is a good chance your call will be "conveniently" dropped. Of course, the worker, unable to identify who they were just talking to,  will have no choice but to forget about you and move to the next client waiting  on hold. You will be left frustrated, inconvenienced and unaccomplished in whatever it was prompting your call in the first place. You will have gotten nowhere and taken all day to get there. The real inconvenience will be in having to wait until the following day, the next week, or worse, until after their "paid" holiday to get your medical insurance approved, your money released or your food stamps loaded on your card. Too bad for you if your surgery gets postponed because you have no insurance coverage, your baby goes without diapers for a day, or your next meal won't happen for another 4 days. At least all the over compensated folks essentially paid to hang up on you will get their much  "needed" rest before they return to the grulling task of picking and choosing who they are going to help!<//Text>

< review>
Terrible. Phones are way too backed up. Expect to be on hold for at least 3 hours. I was on hold for 3 hrs 45 min after I finally got through I was immediately disconnected. Decided to go to the office (with my 1 year old) and it was really upsetting after waiting in line they immediately pushed me away and said they could not help because their services are limited due to COVID. All I needed to do was cancel my medi cal benefits. This is upsetting because they were welcoming others in for applying for benefits, so why couldn’t they help with canceling? The phones need call back options at the very least. Very disappointing.</review>

Super reduced hours 9-12  and NOT able to help existing cases...so you're stuck on the phone for 40 minutes waiting and then  the call gets dropped!  Ugh.  The people helping in the line mean well and are trying to help  but it's like being in a black hole during Covid.</review>

<text>They don't have an efficient way of handling accounts. I waited over 2 hours  just to get hung up on because it went over the time they closed. All I wanted was to know if I had medi-cal still And to get a new card. I suggest dividing up who deals with quick cases and who deals with complicated cases.

Wait times on the phone are absurd. Either put in a feature that allows a caller to know their place in the line throughout the call or hire more staff. I cannot stress how horrible the wait times are. I consistently wait 2 hours to end up having to go somewhere and not able to talk to someone.<//Text>

<Name>Joe Crabshack< /Name>< review>
While reviewing my kids Medi-cal enrollment, someone at Sonoma county unchecked the box saying my husband and I wanted insurance. This caused our insurance plan -separate from MediCal-to be cancelled. It took 2 hours on thephone with the insurance and Covered Ca to determine the county of Sonoma caused this problem. Now I have to wait 14-30 days for the insurance to be normal again. Best case scenario is I have to pay for all doctor visits and medicines for now and the insurance will pay me back later. More time and energy spent on something caused by incompetence. They cant even pave roads anymore they should NOT be in charge of people's health care. And who are they hiring? Not smart caring people with integrity. How much training do they get? Obviously not enough to give a damn about how their work effects people's lives. I wish I could give zero stars and honestly I'd like to sue them. But who has the time.< /review>

<Review>It'll take you hours just to talk to someone the first time and you will likely have to come more than once. It's like the dmv but longer wait times.

If you're a student at SRJC, you can go to Health Services for medi-cal and CalFresh and it'll take you less than 20min.</Review><username>D Tamayo< /username>< UserId.>

<Review>I got through the DMV-like numbered waiting queue fairly quickly (~15 minutes) on a late Monday morning. Had my business dealt with quickly and politely. My only complaint is that the waiting room is a bit stuffy and feels a little germy. I walked out with a tickley, mildly congested-feeling throat. I suppose it's a bit hard to help with the amount of traffic they get every day from people looking for assistance with various healthcare issues, though.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Great place to shop, they’ve added men and children clothing at a great value. The two levels offer a great selection.</Review>

Went on president day and there is a huge line and instead of accommodating and opening more cash registers, they say the store policy don't allow it. After waiting in the line for 35 mins, the cashier was super rude...
They should have some one who knows how to manage the store properly< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b2a47481319:0x5edf114118f7fd44</Gmap_id></record>

<text>They have a really nice selection of men's clothing. Surprisingly and I found few good things on sale that i been looking for. The bad thing is rhat their customer service quality is not all there might be that most of the employees look like they are teen agers or earky 20 year olds who might need s2betyer training.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

I've never had a complaint with this location until today, I want to know why the manager was talking inappropriately about me to her staff right in front of me and was giving me an extremely hard time with my returns (which I had all the recipts for) once I was done with my returns she had told the nice gentleman helping me to stamp a final sale sign on all my items, which he even said we never do this I don't know why she's making me do this, I want to know why she did all this even though I did everything correctly with my returns and why she was being rude when she wasn't even helping me, if anyone knows how I can get the district managers number and complain about her because he customer service and attitude were not  appropriate for her position</Text>

Absolutely horrible conditions all around. Not one thing good i could say about this course. Also too 6 hours to play!! Should fire all management and the greenskeeper and staff!! They honestly don't care about the course one bit. Worst course I've played in 5 or more years easily. Goose Creek is like Augusta National compared to this course. What a shame!< /text>

We had a Tee time of 2:30, but when we got there they informed us they were just finishing up a tournament, but we would make our time.  Well that was off;  we didn’t get on for over an hour later than our scheduled time and then groups in the tournament were going around us on the course.  Because of the backup, we didn’t finish, so my friend spoke to the Director of Golf Larry Werner and he said he would have to speak to the owner and call back. He didn’t call back so, my friend called him.  He said the owner would not comp 9 holes.   This was complete BS since it was their mismanagement of the tournament and lack of honesty on where they were with the times. I decided to call myself to try and get the owner info to give them the opportunity to make it right before posting a negative review, but the person (very friendly and professional) did not know who the owner was; although she did give me the General Managers name.  When I called back to speak to him, Larry answered the phone and told me the GM was no longer working there.  When I asked for the owners name, he said he would ask the owner to call me.  Golf is not cheap and when a golf course screws things up, it should be no problem to comp the 9 holes we didn’t get to play.   Very disappointing to say the least.<//Text>

I've never been more disappointed in a course before. I've played this course dozens of times and it's been heading downhill for 2 years. Today, the management/owners came out before dark (after a long push back in starting time and a training group in front of us) pulled our flag after telling us this was the last hole. I've never had this happen before and the lack of customer service is appalling. After paying for 18 we get to play 6 with daylight still available. Just sad.<//Text>

< Review>
Purchased 18 holes, the play was very congested making it 3 hrs to finish 9 holes. Requested a rain check for the other 9 in which we paid for and they said they would not do it. First time that has happened to me. Would have loved to see the back 9 of the course as it was well maintained but was not going to spend another 3 hours playing it.< /Review>

Played the first day they were allowed to re-open, about a month ago.
Course is great and fun to play, really a shame to see how the place is being ran.  Played 8 holes in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Was told by the starter that a 6 1/2 hour round here is "normal". You're more than welcome to purchase top shelf h2o from the pro shop and at the turn, but there's no where for you to fill up while on the course, but you should know that so a reminder isn't necessary.  There are times of the day when no one answers the phone in the pro shop.  The bathrooms are unkempt.    I won't play here again.<//Text>

<text>Booked a tee time via their website for 2 people. Showed up and played with my buddy. Pace was decent at 4:30hrs. Greens were in great shape but fairways were spotty. They did have sprinklers in the areas and showed they were trying to get them back.

The issue was that next day, I got an email from golfnow stating that I was a no show and was charged $110 for it. Calling the pro shop the manager informed me that my tee time was modified via phone same day to 4. I told him that I did not call in and make the adjustment which he then started to give me attitude about "Well how did my system change" and proceeded to not be very friendly and at the end said he will reverse it and hung up. I will not be coming back to this course anytime soon due to the fact I did nothing wrong and was made to feel like this was my mistake. Not very customer focused in an area where there are plenty of other options to play closely.<//text>< user_name>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>3 stars for great layout and well kept greens but fairways were marginal at best , a lot of bare/brown spots. I played here when they used to call the course SCGA and back then the course was tip-top.  Now they let golfers drive their carts up next to the green which tears up the greenside turf...not sure what to call what's in the bunkers..sandy mud? No marshalls to be seen, could of finished under 4 hrs but had to wait on every hole for these men's club players who only played 12 holes???? I really hate going back to a course I haven't played in over 15 years to conditions that only disappoint my recollection..hello Rancho goodbye SCGA.</text>< GmapID>

GCR is usually a great track with a decent pace but since reopening they have lost control of the tee. Expect to tee off at least 30min later than your tee time and expect a minimum 5 hour round. You’ll show up to the course at noon and see a line of golf carts around the parking lot waiting to tee off. They will tell you the course is really booked but that has nothing to do with teeing off on time. They are overbooking like crazy and expect you to pay the price of them wanting to make their money. Avoid playing here at all costs until they get their act together and run their course like it should be. Play crosscreek or TCI if you’re looking for a decent golf round.< /review>

Played last Monday the 24th of Feb.   Just about the whole fairways were small crab grasses and lots of brown spots. Greens were well kept but too fast for regular players.  Worst of all the middle aged, short skinny guy on the front desk was a jerk and main reason why I have to give this course a one star.  The course was wide open and nobody on the tee box, front and behind and won't let us tee off until our tee time.  Didn't issue a cart key till 15 min prior to tee time.  Didn't have issue before with other younger staffs on the front desk.  Only this said jerk.<//Review>

<text>Driving range has bad balls, but has a great view with not so great turf
Golf course is challenging and interesting
The putting and chipping greens are good
Price for Junior card is bad because they only start those prices at 3 pm and the price is increased to 8 dollars instead of 5
For the normal price it's pretty fair<//text>< Pics>

Unfortunately, bad management has dragged this great track down over the last couple years. Played early and battled sprinklers in the middle of the fairways on multiple holes and maintenance drowning the greens and bunkers while waiting to hit our approach shots. Took relief from puddles in the fairways from the sprinklers being on so long. They definitely could've done the watering well before the first tee times, or stayed a couple holes ahead of the first group. Fairways are pretty beat up and weeds are taking over the entire course. Greens rolled nice, but were very soft. Tee boxes were not mown tight enough for iron shots on par 3 holes. Bunkers are basically dirt or mud. If you play in the late afternoon, be prepared to get kicked off the course with plenty of light left. They care more about saving payroll than serving customers. The price makes it bearable, but some of these issues are avoidable with proper management.<//Review>

They should be ashamed of themselves for charging full price. Fairways are a cow pasture. Everything, except the greens, are dead or dying. No matter where you drive it in the fairway, you'll need to find a patch of grass, or a weed, to hit from. Use to love this course. Won't be going back. Too bad.</text>

Even though they lost our tee time(called 3 days in advance...)they got us on close to the original time and were very apologetic. Course in decent shape with a few iffy fairways but good fast greens. My son and I enjoyed our round, we'll be back.< /Text>

<Date>1560908828275<//Date><rate>2< /rate><Text>Ill keep this short, the bunkers are in terrible condition. Most of the fairways are not well kept and patchy. We did not see the marshall all day so pace of play was horrible. We had to skip 3 holes to get out of a log jam, and then proceeded to get hassled when we went back to try and play the holes we paid for. "Its unacceptable to skip holes, dont do it next time". Well if you had someone making sure we are not on pace for a 6hr round we wouldnt have to skip. Whats unacceptable is the condition your course is in and your marshall not doing his job. Lower your rates, hire new people, or get your stuff together. What a bad experience it was playing here. Maybe i got unlucky but there are 10 other courses within a 10 mile drive that would be a better bang for your buck. It gets 2 stars because the greens are well kept and challenging.<//Text>< pics>

Looking for a fun day of golf on a weekend this is not the place. After 3.5 hours and only being on the 8th hole we just left. The Pro shop's a joke. The only thing I can say positive about this place.. the driving range is not bad but other than that don't waste your time. Weekdays may be okay but the course is not challenging for a decent golfer so that's another consideration. I was extremely disappointed after driving all the way from San Diego.</text>

This course was a great course at one time but since new ownership has gone down hill fast. Employees are voicing they are not being paid, lakes are dried up and being used to water, practice range ball baskets have been reduced to less balls, and course is being over booked. Such BS. Do not golf here they are destroying what use to be a nice place to play.< /Review>

Charged $42 for an afternoon round and the course is in rough condition.  Disappointed in the quality of fairways.  You hit a great tee shot and your ball could be in dirt patches.  Not acceptable for the prices charged.  Also, carts need to be updated with GPS.<//Review>

< Review>
Played hear yesterday in memory of a fellow friend. Course is not pleasing to the eye as it has definitely ran its course, literally. $41 to play this track is not worth the fee, play Menifee instead or for a lesser price the other local tracks. Staff was questionable as well, especially the bearded gentleman at the front desk not welcoming at all as I tried to ease his obvious tension several times with no luck. All n all not worth the price, and they treat you like you are the privileged one to play their course unless you are a frequent player as I noticed the interaction with a local during this funless experience. They will be my last resort at a GolfNow price. Sadly, it was one of my favorites in the past.< /Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>The Golf Club at Rancho California (formerly the Southern California Golf Association Golf Course) saves its most undulating and scenic holes for the closing stretch. The flip-side of putting the scenery and drama at the end, is starting you off with a few testing golf challenges, not least at the long opening par-3. The plunging, downhill par-4 12th, and uphill par-4 16th and 17th holes are three of the best to look out for.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Horrible menu.  Slow service.  Landscapers with blowers that could not care less that you're eating on the patio at lunch time.  Using a LOUD blower to push 20 leaves across a patio for the whole hour we were there.  I was looking for a tv crew to see if it was a joke.  Never going back.</Review>

5 1/2 hour round. It was torture. They have a notice in the cart telling you to play in 4 to 4.5 hours, but they don't do a thing to fix it. Never going back.</Text>

<Text>Great 👍 pawn shop always polite and professional. And willing to help I've came in there with nothing but gold around my neck and the clothes on my back and was treated the same as when I when in to buy my jewelry back. That's why I continue to come here and recommend 👌 this pawn shop to all my friends and family.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Justin was very knowledgeable. Absolutely loved his vibes. Great energy and ora. Extremely well versed in coins and Cher songs. Not sure how, but he was able to bring up Cher about 16 different times with ease. Definitely the greatest coin expert I've run into in a long time. Ask him about his BBQ sauce trick!!!<//Review><name>Julian Derasta</name><rating>5</rating><Time>1601354979732</Time><UserId.>102883732519103496724</UserId.>< Resp>

This place is great! They're very helpful, and courteous. It's really nice to see the large variety of coins, silver ignots, and much more! (they're a coin shop also). They assisted me in a layaway plan for a diamond ring. I recommend this place.< /review>

Wow! These guys really went out of the way to help me solve my problem. They didn't stop until they had a solution that worked for everybody. Just took a couple weeks of stress off my shoulders. No doubt about it, they sincerely wanted to help. Thank you Gold & Silver Trading Co!<//text>

Over the years, I have come to trust Gold & Silver Trading Co. Their employees are pleasant, knowledgeable and always very helpful. My recent experience with one of their associates Julian was on par with the type of Customer Service I have come to expect and received in the past from Snyder and Justin. Kameron has built a great team. I know these guys by name because they build healthy relationships with their customers and have proven themselves to provide  honest service.
None of these guys are the typical rude associates I have dealt with at other shops in town. Whether you are buying or selling, you will definitely get the best, most fair price here.< /Review>

I’ve been to so many pawn shops all across the country and the boss is one of the most knowledgeable and fair on prices that I’ve ever seen the place is to well ran they opened a second pawn shop in the same city not is that common that is Unbelievable and there doing it while we are in a pandemic I’ve seen employees from other pawn stores take there items there instead of there own job because the prices are just better they have a safe a friendly staff and are even up to date on High end items lv Rolex’s I even got a 500$ note there from sports cards to video games this isn’t we buy gold place it’s a best birthday gift store no one asked me to write  this I’m just speaking the truth so much so that they have me working to one day open my own store< /Review>

<review>Best pawn shop in town. They have excellent customer engagement. The place is clean and the inventory is interesting and more higher end. In particular the selection and prices of gold, silver and coinage is the best in town. This is The place to buy metals. Shout out to Julian.

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I am very delighted with the lay out of the store, excited by the quality of the products but mostly for the friendliness, intellectual & professionalism from the employees, in particular Julian. I have bought as well as received products from this pawn shop and I must say I am pleased every time. There are multiple pawn shops in Bakersfield but this employee in particular is what makes Gold & Silver stand out from them all that makes me recommend this shop with everyone I talk to!

Wow amazing customer service best pawnshop in town not only are they very fair on pricing but very knowledgeable too. I went in yesterday to sell and ended up buying lol They have such a huge selection of Silver, gold, and coins this store stands out from the rest most pawn shops have very rude dealers. You can tell the guys that work here are real genuinely nice people, I hope that continues because I will be  returning. Definitely worth checking out, a hidden gem for sure.<//Text>

<review>This was my 1st time at a pawn shop and it was actually a fun experience! I was selling gold and Justin, who helped me, could not have been nicer or more helpful. It was quite a process testing the gold and he was very patient with all of my questions. I also did some browsing while I was there and they have a nice selection of things, including some nice high end watches. I highly recommend!< /review>< userid>

I have to say, after hours of searching the internet and asking people I know, gold and silver trading company holds a terrific reputation. Called them first and when I arrived to do business, they were truthful and friendly. I HIGHLY recommend this business to all who are looking to do reputable business with a reputable company. Great job guys!!! Thank you for everything.<//review>

< review>
Needed to find a coin shop, was hesitant to visit a pawn shop, but thought I would give it a try. Been there 3 times now. They have a reasonable selection of coins & the seller is knowledgeable. The staff could use some training in customer service & basic people skills. They want you in and out. Looking at coins can take some time. Felt rushed and was constantly reminded that salesman had other work to do.

They have some nice coins, interesting jewelry, watches, comic books. Just about anything you might collect. I got a free Buffalo nickel for this review.</review>

I came here for the first time yesterday and was treated very well by Joel. I wasn’t aware we had a silver coin dealer around much anymore and much to my surprise this shop has some very nice pieces and I would recommend anyone to go here anytime. You’ve got a customer for life here.<//Text>

Today I visited this shop to sell some coins I had and although the staff is especially nice and the shop clean and cool, unfortunately the man I talked with had no idea what he had in front of him. Two of the coins I brought in were priced at $625 by PCGS to sell. At auction they've taken in over $2,000 on multiple occasions. Like I said, great people clean environment but error coins just aren't their thing.</Review>

This place is great. I went there for the second time today with my dad. Great service, and the owner, Kameron, is very patient, considerate, and knows his stuff. Huge selection of coins, foreign and native, along with silver and gold medallions. Best place in Bakersfield to buy coins. A++< /review>

Love this place. Tons of cool stuff, very reasonable prices. I've also sold to them, some antique glassware, a purse, and jewelry, and they aren't lowballers. They give you more than fair offers. The guys here are very knowledgeable and helpful. I won't ever go to any other place but this one. There isn't another one like it here in town.<//review>

Furthermore, not only do I encourage you to visit the shop with your valuables today, but more importantly get to meet the humble staff:  Mike,Joel,Cam, and Jolly - Snyder...whom without a doubt will provide excellent customer service with respect to your precious valuables.

These guys really know their stuff! Really helpful and friendly guys. If you have something you are not too sure about, they can definitely help. I bought a generator here about six months ago. I got a great deal, and the generator is still running strong. I definitely would recommend this place.< /review>

<review>This is an amazing business. The owner Kamern is honest and very kind, as was the rest of his staff. They make you feel right at home. I have purchased several items here including silver. Their jewelry is beautiful and awsome prices. They carry designer hand bags, gorgeous, and great prices, can't find them any place in town.  I recommend this family shop to all my friends and family. Can't wait to buy a new purse!</review><gmap_id>0x80ea699cfc611c8d:0x5d921df1f9d388e7<//gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate></record>

Kameron and the rest of the guys at Gold & Silver Trading Co. are GREAT!!!

Everyone here is really knowledgeable and friendly and are always more than happy to talk to you about what you're looking for or brought in.
Wonderful experiences every time I've gone.

Horrible customer service!! They treat people like theives. I was standing in line waiting to be helped and an employee walked up to me and insisted that I put a coin of my own in my pocket.. it was obviously mine, coz it was a Canadian 1953 cent. In a dingy coin sleeve. He also said that my being there, made him feel uncomfortable. WOW</review>

OK, since they're asking a higher price does it even come with the AC/DC converter used to power item up?
Their reply: "Why bother contacting me? Feel free to search somewhere else on (ebay,  sic) for the item."...which appears to be in line with some of their other reviews regarding lacking customer courtesy. I surely hope Kameron Kephart reviews responses here as well as the ebay side of their business!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The worst service ive ever encountered. Guy named Joel was very rude to everyone. When I left he actually told another customer he just didnt like me. When you go into a business expecting professionals to assist you and you get some jerk that doesnt have what it takes to make you feel like doing business with them ever again, it really says alot about how the place is really ran. I will make sure to let everyone I know that this place isnt the right place to go if your trying to pawn or sell anythng. Its too bad that one ignorant person can have such a negative impression on a place. It really makes the place look bad!< /text>< pics>

The new staff has terrible service. The first time I ordered delivery for my pizza, they never showed up and never called. It was a big order and my workers were hungry way past an hour after their lunch. I gave my money and a fat tip to someone else. This time around my pizza is late again for almost an hour extra from their estimated delivery. I had a cash tip, ready to give them a second chance, still didnt arrive anywhere close to the estimated extra time EVEN AFTER CALLING. The previous staff was really awesome, really friendly and I gave them a ton of business. Sorry Papa John's, your out of my expense book. My hard earned money is going somewhere else. Good luck!< /text>

<Review>Papa johns at 735 San Mateo Ave San Bruno California. Will not help you with problem with an order. Even though you got charged on your credit card. With a online order. And the manager will hang up on you. Told me to take it up with my credit card company. Told me the only way to get my order was to order it again and pay twice for it. I know no one here cares about my business. I also called twice. First time I was told my order was on its way. Second time they claimed I ordered from the wrong store. But I verified from the charge that it was indeed their store.< /Review>< Pictures>

I just received a delivery order from them again at my hotel and the food was good this time and delivered timely however once again the salad dressing for my salad was missing. I questioned the driver asking for it and he said it was inside the sealed salad which was not true. This is a quality issue that needs to be addressed.< /text>< name>

They said delivery would take between 30 minutes to an hour. I expected about 45 minutes. I didn’t receive my order until an hour and a half, and all we got were two small pizzas and some bread sticks. Not to mention the bread sticks were burnt and they forgot the ranch we asked for.</Text>

<Text>Don't order in-store because not all options are apparent. You can get much more variety and options by looking at the online menu, and you can get access to some deals there. Overall, however, the pizzas are too pricey for what you get. Also, my brother says he saw the workers at this particular location drop the dough on the floor and use it for a pizza anyways. Stay cautious.</Text>< Pics>

Customer service is no good and they have to fix that online app tells you 20-30 mins, when you arrive it's not ready till another 40 mins. Needs more staff or really say how long it's going to take.<//review>

I stay at the Brisbane Marina on a regular basis twice before I have had Papa John’s deliver pizza to meet without any questions asked but recently the manager who goes by the name of Christine has stated that I am not within their delivery zone this is very frustrating due to the fact that I have a had two orders previously delivered to me I get into an argument and a pissing contest for lack of better terms over her delivery and every time I end up canceling my order because she will not deliver to me because I’m out of here</review>

So I was thinking about ordering a pizza from Papa Johns (Different Location) for a sports game. Then I remembered that I didnt write my review for this location. So I looked up this location to write my review about my experience. And WOW a guy from 10 months ago says he got crazy sick after pizza from this location. I writing this review in late May. I ordered a pizza from this location around late March.

The Next day after eating pizza from this location, I was SUPER SICK (Both Ends) By the 2nd day I thought about calling an Ambulance bc I didn't know what the hell was going on with me. I seriously thought I was going to pass out. It had to be food poisoning. I've never experienced that before in my life. Muscle weakness and fatigue for about 5 days, 6 to 7 days I was good. I never called the location bc I ordered through Uber eats.

I didnt want them to say it couldve been my driver that did something. I went to a party that ordered from this location BUT I DIDNT KNOW IT. I felt not so well the next day after eating some slices. I asked him where he got it, he said Papa John's (This Location) OMG

Man, I'm 0 for 2! I have to stay clear of this place.< /text>

Don't ever order from here.  As a vegan, they got my order wrong on and put cheese on it.  They probably have one of those untrained employees who don't think it's important  Trying to force me to eat dairy.  No one is answering their phones to correct this order.  What a waste of time.  All I got from trying to give them business was bad service and a weak attempt to give me a bad night.  Never ordering from them again.  Just go out of business if you can't maintain a restaurant properly.<//Review>

< review>
I went in to buy a gun. Didn't have my registration. Came back and dropped it off, naturally I thought that's all I had to do. When I went in after the 10 day waiting period the gal that works there said she had not started it yet. I told her that I dropped off my registration to her personally. She said it was my job to remind her to start my waiting period. So it's the customers job to remind them to do their job. Keep that in mind when shopping here.<//review>

{'time': 1621968431797, 'text': "Hello Aaron, we have many customers that just bring in various documents for there packets all the time. So if the customer doesn't give us any more information than, that they are just dropping something off, we don't know what else needs to be done until we place the document with your packet. Also, you might be waiting to start the 10 day wait period because of something else going on. We can't just start the 10 day wait without the customer, you have to sign documents and provide your thumb print. Then you would also receive a document from us that has the date and time for pick-up letting you know that the 10 day wait has started. So for you to assume that the wait period started without your signature or thumb print, was not on us. Next time maybe ask to speak to someone about the situation before writing a review weeks later. Have a wonderful day!"}< /response>

He knows a huge amount about all different types of guns, and is not stuck up at all like a Turner' s etc. If you want straight forward good help, and an actual straight answer on availability during Covid-19 times, you cannot beat the service at Brass and Bass. I can say that after shopping at Turner's, Bass Pro Shop, Big 5 (ammo only) every local SoCal Range, nothing beats the service from Bill. Thank you!<//review>< gmapID>

<text>I'm not sure why this store got so many bad reviews, particularly the guy below me named "george luna" who gave a negative review just because the employee helping him didn't hear his friend say thank you, doesn't make sense to me at all. The people who work here are very helpful, knowledgable, and welcoming from my experience, and have the best customer service of any gun store I've ever been too, don't let the bad reviews fool you because it seems like a lot of them are way too entitled and critical.

The blonde woman who works there was very cool. Definitely going to be my go to store especially since they are veteran owned which makes it even better. 🇺🇸🇺🇸<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Great customer service! Been Twice already. Bought ammo nice and easy. Second visit dropped off my 80 series colt 1911 for some work with no hassle.

Gotta say though with all these people complaining about lines and wait times. It’s just how things are now. I recently stood outside bass pro for 3-4 hrs just to get told to come back the next day. My waits here were nothing less than 30min to get in. Better than a lot of other gun shops around.

Can’t wait to come back for my Colt! 👌😁< /Review>< pics>

That's been my experience after two transfers and a failed third attempt because they wouldn't provide their FFL license number to gun manufacturer. Claimed the manufacturer already had it, but the manufacturer said it was expired and they failed to send new license number.< /Text>< pics>

I called her to ask about a handgun if it was California compliant I talked to a woman there she was really nasty short didn't want to be on the phone and I would never buy a gun there or anything else. They really need to learn about customer service this is what business is all about evidently they like it<//Review>

Went to get a gun transfer done. The clerk told us that, because of COVID-19 no one in the city was performing these transactions and that I had to schedule a date month in advance for his store to do it. He then solicited my partner for $40 to do the transaction that day. Other people came in to transfer heir guns, but I didn't see extra funds being given out for their transaction. I will never go there again.< /Text>

Super unprofessional! Asked about an item and the lady with back hair (idk her name) literally answered “whatever you see in here is what I have” knowing I have no idea where they specifically put anything in their store. It’s almost like they’re proud of not having anything in stock lol. I usually do all of my firearm business at WestCoast Ammo, they provide much better customer service. But since B&B is closer to my home I visited their store and it was just a really poor visit. Save a trip and don’t come to Brass & Bass and just go down to WestCoast Ammo where there is a higher chance of them having stock and if not at-least you won’t receive a poor answer. I know we’re all stressing the pandemic but atleast “act” like you want to help provide assistance for civilians. 0/10.<//Text>

If you are a first time gun buyer and do not have alot of knowledge on fire arms or California laws, probably not the place to go. The whole process seemed rushed and uncomfortable. I dealt with two different people that work here and they seem willing to answer questions but bothered by it in the process. Customer service is not their priority just protocol. If you are trying to sell something probably not the
best way to go about it. Neither is acting like you are doing someone a favor by selling them an item when you are getting payed for that service.<//text>

<review>Probably the worst customer service of any gun shop in the Temecula/Murrieta area. Unless you’re purchasing a gun or ammo, they seem annoyed that you even showed up.

<Review>My first visit was slightly unpleasant, I had to wait a long time to be seen and there was definitely a but of melodromatic moments going on while I was inside. With that said however the staff were really friendly and welcoming. They provided their input to ensure what I ordered was what I needed and are obviously avid supporters of the 2A. The gun smith, though i forgot his name, was helpful in ordering parts that i had forgotten i would need and updated me on issues and progress on a previous order. 10/10 recommend.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Great people! The owners and staff are great, I have been a repeat customer for a couple of years now. On hand stock is minimal but you can buy from their online shop and pick up in store. The best part is not being treated like a criminal when you enter like other popular shops nearby thanks Bass and Brass< /Text>

There are a few good gun shops in the area, but when gun talk turns serious I always head to Brass and Bass. The owner is very knowledgeable and just as important he is easy to talk to. I don't get that at the other shops. I've bought plenty of shooting supplies and made use of the gunsmith's services. All in all this is a great shop to visit.</review>

I took a relatively old rifle for evaluation. It needed a replacement part. I was notified within a week that it was finished. Great work, good evaluation of the rifle. The owners are very helpful. I recommend this store to all my friends. From a retired PO.< /review>

Bill, Chris and all the employees at Brass and Bass are very knowledgeable and helpful. They take the time to answer any questions you may have. We have made many purchases from them and have always felt like we got a good deal on everything. They have also gone out of their way to find a replacement magazine for my old Colt. It took some time to find a source but they finally got it for me. I highly recommend Brass & Bass for anyone looking for a reputable and friendly gun store.< /text>

Brass & Bass is easily the best Gun Store in Murrieta. Once I walked in, I was greeted by the Owners Bill & Chris. They were both very friendly & knowledgeable, so you can ask them anything from Firearms to Fishing Equipment & Supplies. They have a huge wall of Fishing stuff too!</Text>

<review>Just went in to get my anniversary present. Very helpful and knowledgeable shop owners. I bought a Bersa .380. It fit my hand perfectly. They are also great at custom orders. Bill (shop owner) is going to have the frame dipped in a color of my choice. Will definitely be going back there. Very professional and personable.<//review>< time>

Great 1st impression here. Referred by a friend in the time of need during a .308 lower build and Bill helped us out and was so appreciated!! Cool guy and would definitely trust his help and advice in the future. We'll be making the drive from Riverside to come see them again :)< /text>

Gone into store twice to look at a handgun for my first purchase. I've shot rifles and shotguns my entire life so I'm new to pistols but they're super helpful and while looking at a few for my first purchase they have taught me a lot of safety and technique. Look forward to making y first handgun purchase from them when they can get it in stock. I've tried turners and other stores for the same model ( Sig sp2022) and everywhere is also sold out and back ordered so them not having it in stock is not there fault at all. GREAT SHOP<//text>

Me and my wife got our FSC cards and they treated us with respect and professionalism. They are polite and have a sense of humor. It felt like we were talking to old friends. We're planning on buying a handgun in the near future from this cool store.< /Review>

Outstanding Customer Service. Bought my first handgun from here and have been buying ammo off and on here for awhile. Staff is always very friendly and informative and don't have the typical "gun store" attitude that you find so often these days. Highly recommend.< /Review>

We love this place! We have been to this gun store a few times already and each time both the owners, Bill & Chris, are very friendly. Bill just helped us choose the first gun to buy for our son. We went with the Keystone Crickett .22 LR and it is awesome! This gun shop is competitively priced and we can't wait for the grand opening this Saturday!<//text>

I have nothing but good things to say about this company. The two owners are very knowledgeable individuals in both fishing and shooting. They are both Patriots to this country and serve their country in the military. These guys are cool to sit there and talk with and have absolutely no problem answering your questions. at this point I would recommend nobody else but these two and they're gunsmith job for all your shooting fishing and smithing needs. they have definitely earned my business and I will continue to go here in the future</Review>

There is a lot of great things to be said for this store. I am definitely one to do my part when it comes to supporting local businesses. I also feel i'm not wasteful with my money. Luckily here I get to do both. Chris and Bill have always taken the time in answering my questions (even if I ask the same ones over and over) as well as doing the best they can to offer competitive pricing. If the dont have it in, they can get it. Hope they continue to do well. I have purchased 2 firearms from them and looking to pick up some more to build my collection.< /review>

Very rude people. Literally lost all of my interest in purchasing a firearm. Just because I'm new to this state and not familiar with the laws. Doesn't mean to raise your voice and act foolish. Too much testosterone. My guess.<//review>

<text>This place is great! They have a variety of candy and tons of party supplies. We had a Fiesta themed party and this was the place where I found all of my favorite Mexican candies. If you're looking to create a candy bar, this is the place for you. They have containers, decoration, and colored candy to choose from.< /text>< Pictures>

Best Breakfast ever! Loved the Omelet, Hash Browns and Coffee. Never let my coffee get empty. And on a Sunday morning they were very busy. Definitely worth waiting for. Highly recommend this family owned restaurant. Can I rate you 6 Stars? My 12 yr old son wanted a Cheeseburger for Breakfast, so yes they will serve that as well. Wow, what a cheeseburger. My Son claims it’s the Best he’s ever had!</Review>

We had the Joe's special with hash browns and Mini combo #1 (pancake with bacon and egg). Every single item was cooked perfectly, and the bacon is worth a special mention!! Loved the scrambled egg with spinach and minced beef, and the hash brown and toast were excellent. The service is fast, friendly and very attentive, refilling our coffees without us even having to ask for it. This diner hit all the right spots, highly recommend!!< /text>

Limited menu, but the food is good. It was located in the Westlake Shopping Center for almost 60 years, but the corporate landlord wanted so much more $$$ that the owners could not renew their lease. Damn shame - their business at the new location lacks foot traffic.</Review>

<review>I never knew this place was even here. Past by many times without even noticing this spot. Then my girlfriend told me about it and wanted some breakfast. Clean seating as you walk in and along side with nice service.< /review>< Date>

We were visiting from out of town and were looking for a local place - we found this no fuss, classic American diner. Very friendly staff and great prices. Thoroughly enjoyed our meals here!</review>

My wife and I love this place. Who likes to drink coffee - also recommend visiting this place. Always fresh and very tasty coffee. Very invigorating in the morning before a hard day's work. Delicious and fresh buns can also be bought here. The staff is quick and caring I think that it should be so in San Francisco< /Review>

My family and I went here for a nice light lunch and we loved it! The staff is great and the posters of classic movies are adorable. If you like shrimp I recommend theirs. If your a tea lover they have many different teas to choose from so that was really nice to have.</review>

It is a very cute cafe with a very nice staff, it is not however, a coffee shop, which is why it only gets three stars.  The name of the cafe is kind of a lie.  Decent chocolate shake.< /review>

This used to be our "go to spot" for Sunday morning breakfast. Once while there with a group of 10-12, we were asked to leave, after eating while still drinking coffee and talking. We had not return for about a year but decided to give them another try. Food quality not as good as we remembered. We will not make this mistake again.<//text>

The service was great, but the breakfast was mediocre. We had French toast and pancakes, both of which were only just OK. The scrambled eggs were cooked well, but honestly could have used a little salt and or pepper. Same for eggs over easy. The bacon was good, but it arrived undercooked instead of crispy which is what we asked for. The sausage was also good.
It was surprising how disappointing our two breakfasts were based on the google reviews. Nothing was either very good or outstanding.<//Text>

If you enjoy toast that is not toasted, or love potatoes that are virtually raw, bacon that is so well done (didnt ask for it to be well or crisp) that is like a board and service that is just blah then this is your place. $30 bucks for garbage.< /Text><user_id>105067332385009745078</user_id><Name>Denise Gray</Name>< rating>

The food was not bad, but nothing special either. Parking is free, which is really important in this area. The service was slower compared to other coffee shops, and it seemed to me that the waitress could not wait for her shift to just end (we were there around 10 a.m.)</Review>

The original location of Westlake Coffee Shop used to be near the Westlake Library until the business temporarily shut down for a few years back in the early 2000s. Then, Westlake Coffee Shop relocated near Century Theater where there's more foot traffic.

When Westlake Coffee Shop used to be located in Westlake itself, I was a student at OLM. I would stop by almost everyday after school for a bite to eat or do my homework. The waitresses didn't mind and were very hospitable. Flash forward and now Westlake Coffee Shop moved to a different part of Daly City where there are better parking options. Waitresses have changed obviously, but that 50s vibe remained.

I enjoy coming here on Sunday mornings for breakfast. I often order their Westlake Special with hash browns. I've tried their burgers, which are pretty dry. I've also tried their omelettes, which are very filling. Decently priced meals. Friendly management. You can even order take out if you don't want to dine in. Overall, nice place to have breakfast or lunch until they close at 3pm.< /review>

Sort of and old timey coffee shop like you would run into in the late 60s 70s. The Waitresses still wear uniforms, probably from the same era. The menu is light and what you would expect in such a diner, nothing fabulous, but just what you would expect… a bite to eat. Although they have change locations from their former slot at the Westlake Shopping Center, their new place is clean and bright.</review>

I enjoyed my veggie omelet and I love the restaurant theme.  My date was disappointed with his ribeye steak (too chewy) and that his veggies were frozen, not fresh.  Staff, owners very nice and I plan to return, without my date.</review>

The food was mediocre, my hashbrowns tasted like fish. The bacon was hard. The lemonade tasted like orange juice. The only redeeming quality would be the service provided. Our waitress was lovely. Didn't catch her name unfortunately, but she was wonderful.</Text>

Always fast service, friendly staff, and food is great. Since it's a smaller location, sometimes it can fill up because it's a good place to have a relaxed breakfast.<//review>

<text>Decide in advance whether it's worth it to you to stand in a bakery line for 45 minutes. The upside – out-of-towers get to meet interesting locals. Everything we had was excellent--croissants, breakfast rolls, bread pudding, pain au jambon--but be prepared to bring it elsewhere as seating is skimpy.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808f7c5b7cb9a52d:0x62ce22e8aba3d39d<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>Food - a little better than average American diner food.
Service - I was looking for a place to sit, read, and drink coffee. Although they were never rude or pushy, I could tell I was not their favorite customer.

Overall - decent joint but not for me.< /Review>< Time>

I love this place. We enjoy our weekend brunch at this coffee shop. The premises are clean and the host is very warm and checks on you frequently. And Yes, the food is really good - fresh, organic, tasty. Portions are good as well.< /review>

I'm not a big "shopper" but  always find something that's 'me' when I go in there.  When I need a gift for someone Old Navy will usually be my first stop. They regularly have good sales.<//Text>

The sales staff is eager to please, and we'll informed. Kids seem to really like the styles they sale, but if your over 40 it might not be your cup of tea. Store was very clean and organized making it very easy to track down anything you might need.<//Text>< pics>

Excellent customer service. They didn't have the size jeans I wanted in stock, so they ordered a pair from another nearby location and shipped them to me for free. I'll definitely be coming back to this location again.</review>

Misleading Ads. Big sign in the window 50% off Denim. Walk in the store... Today only 50% percent off! Grab a pair of pants from the table with the song on it and go to the register and yup, full price. "Oh, that's only for the sweaters". I thought the days of deceptive pricing were over.....</Text>

<Review>Unfortunately for me, this the closest old navy to where I live. There's a lady there (might be the manager) that is so rude to me I just avoid her when I'm there. She's condescending and no help when asked questions. I do like their inventory but I rather make the drive to the glendora store where staff is way friendlier and helpful. Sorry and fix it! I love old navy and I want to love your store!!!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Ordered online, went to the store to pick up and the didn't have any record of the transaction even though we had already paid 3 hours prior. Had to wait in the store for an hour for them to get the "stuff" together.</text>

<Review>I was so impressed at the kindness shown by this location. While ordering my food (which was also fresh and delicious,) a man passing by went to the window and said he was hungry and asked for a corn dog. The guy at the window kindly gave him a fresh cooked corn dog. Faith in humanity restored!<//Review>< pictures>

Apparently they are still in school learning at the expense of others. My husband ordered and paid for a chili cheese burger meal with a large fry and drink, he got a medium fry and a basic cheese burger with everything my husband hates on it, onion, mayo or mustard I didn't pay attention to that color, however thanx wienerscnichel for altering our order, however since we're paying, how about ypu allow us to make those necessary changes.</text>

<Text>You just can't beat Wienerschnitzel for their chili cheese items.  The fries, hot dogs, hamburgers can all be ordered with chili cheese. I receive coupons in the mail and utilize them to make my visit of even more value.  The area isn't good but that doesn't prevent the employees from being very courteous and efficient.  Kudos!<//Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

This spot is the one I like best. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this place I  constantly return again and again. The stuff is very helpful and the cooking they serve is so yummy. I would always prefer to have a decent meal here. Highly recommended.</review>

Customer service was great but one of the workers walked in front of my car in the drive thru to get to the other building while I was pulling forward. I think they should look before they walk out.< /text>

<review>For some reason the food is inconsistent. Some times the fries are hot, other times warm. Same goes for their corn dogs.
Ask for mustard only. At pick up and ordering. Rarely get it. Even though we request mustard and absolutely no ketchup.  They seem to think we do. We get more ketchup than mustard.
Staff has a problem with listening to their customers.  If you mention at ordering that you have a coupon, the staff seem surprise to actually see the coupon and have to redo the entire order for pricing.<//review><Time>1557436755262<//Time><name>Irenia Guajardo</name>< user>

No matter what Wienerschnitzel ive been too they are good consistant and get your food in a good time. The only gripe i have about this location is if its busy this is a small parking lot. Gets kind of crowded. Not there fault for being an original location.<//Review>

Fast service, nice customer service and good fresh food. Wienershnitzel is a bit pricey but over all everything is good. The jalapeno poppers are super delicious and their shakes as well really recomend them both.</text>

This is a great place to eat. You can sit outside under umbrellas or take it wherever. It is a very clean, fast and very friendly.  Prices are good and they have coupons.< /review>

<Review>I come here all the time and get the Bacon ranch fries and they always the bomb 👌👌👌 And I also order the frosted lemonade and when I got it 2 times I've come here before and it was great tasted like a frosted lemonade but now it's my 5-6 time coming to get this and it hasn't tasted the same since the first 2... Smh the ice is just crushed in it and big pieced are in it a lot and it takes away the taste of it all cuz it tastes watery real fast..<//Review><name>Raina Salazar</name>< userid>

This weinerschnitzel location isnone of the best fast food locations in the city. Always great customer service even the younger workers are always very respectful and polite (which is hard to find these days) My food has always been prepared properly and if a situation ever did arise the staff handled it very well. Best jalapeño poppers around!</text>
