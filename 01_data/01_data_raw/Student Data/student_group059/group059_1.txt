This place was great! Brought an iPhone 11 Pro Max with the back glass shattered. Eric replaced the back glass for $129, which was the lowest price I could find. He was very professional and the work was done well. I will definitely be a return customer just based on Eric’s customer service. Definitely recommend, 10/10.<//review>

Friday I called to check on getting the battery in my iPhone 7 replaced. They told me to bring it in and they’d need it for about an hour. First thing was they wanted to know what was my complaint with the phone. He looked in my settings to see what the condition of my battery was. He said it’s borderline on whether it needs to be replaced. He gave me options. It wasn’t about making money, it was about what was in my best interest. Right away I knew this was quality business. I came back in an hour. Phone was ready and he had replaced a screw that was missing and tightened two that had vibrated loose. It was like the phone had been serviced in addition to replacing the battery. I was charged the original quoted price for the battery. I wish more businesses were run like this These guys should be in business for a long time. And I’m back to charging my phone once per day.<//Review>

Great skilled techs that restored my Samsung Note 20 Ultra phone to new (shattered glass) for about $50 less than the local repair shop.  These guys are the recommended "Samsung Care" location.</review>

<resp>{'time': 1619030552222, 'text': "Good Day! Thank you for taking the time to write us! All repairs comes equipped with a lifetime manufacture & installation warranty, ensuring you only receive a product and service that’ll last a lifetime! Our warranty, for example, is the same as the 1 year warranty you receive from Apple when you purchase a new device, covering any defects such as: glitching, touch issues, display discoloration, etc., except extended for life! That is how confident & prideful the Fixology team is! Physical damage such as cracks voids the warranty, Apple nor us would replace your cracked screen at no cost.\n\nIn regards to your specific issue, our records show that you cracked your iPhone screen prompting you to come in requesting we glue your glass back to the housing unit. Considering the request, we wouldn't say it's a ridiculous one, but it definitely is one of the more further fetched ones we've received. We hold ourselves to same standards a company such as Apple would to provide the same superb quality & service you would receive from the tech titan themselves! Apple would not accept such a request, and neither would we. Our industry has a bad precedent set by our competitors: low standards & lack of morale. A precedent Fixology works day & night to fight for the sake of providing our clients a safe haven, a feeling of comfort & security.\n\nLong story short, the only route to take for a cracked screen is replacement.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to us if you need any further help understanding why we could not honor your request! We’d love to help you out to the furthest extent we possibly can! We’re here for you! I have also attached my personal cell number for direct contact.

<text>I’m pretty sure I’m reviewing the right place... I was referred to this place by a friend of a friend and brought here by said friend. I brought my son’s iPhone 6 that was severely cracked and on a whim I decided to fix my screen which was also cracked. A little back story: I’ve had my iPhone 8 for a couple years now and spilled chocolate milk on it when I’d had it for only a couple months. The sound on my phone has been terrible ever since! Imagine walking around and using a phone for years with terrible sound. It sucks but you kinda get used to it. Anyway. I cracked the screen not too long ago (maybe a month or two). Now to present time. They fixed my screen and now all of a sudden I CAN HEAR! It’s glorious! It’s a bit shocking to me every time I hear sounds coming from my phone. I don’t know what you guys did, but thank you!! Well worth the price (which was very reasonable!)<//text>< pictures>

Spoke with Josh regarding a screen replacement yesterday. He was very personable and helpful. He took the time to discuss other options for my particular situation and offered his assistance in the future regardless of purchase or service. I highly recommend this business and will definitely come to them first for any future needs. Thanks, Josh!</Review>

I went to get my phone repaired 2 days ago, he said that it would take an hour, istg it was only 20 minutes I got it back it was in the best condition, last time I got it repaired in a place in Texas and they did a horrible job the screen had a weird blob on it and the corner of the screen wasn’t fully intact. GOOD JOB FIXOLOGY. Eric was very professional and nice.</Text>

Brought in my iPad 5 gen because I thought the charging portal may be broken.  But thanks to the wonderful young man, he found the problem and removed a broken piece of the charging cable. It was not easy to remove but he did it will great care and skill. Then he even cleaned the portal for me. When I pulled out my debit card he told me to put it away as there was no charge. He was happy to help and said it was a blessing. This young man is not even 21 yet, but he and two friends both younger than 26, have started this business and hope to make it successful.
This is one small company we should all support! You will not be disappointed.<//text>

<Text>This place was great! We were camping at Joshua Tree and my kid cracked the screen on her iPhone 6 Plus. This place was close by and had great reviews so we'd thought we'd check it out so get her phone fixed quick before we got to Anaheim/Disneyland. We got there on a (Oct 6th) Sunday afternoon and the worker fixed her phone in about 15 minutes for about $70. They even have a pool table to keep you entertained while they're working on your phone. They offered a discount on a new screen protector, but were out of stock for the particular one we needed at the time. Definitely recommend this place.</Text>< Date>

I came to the Fixology booth today totally not expecting to have my screen replaced. The gentlemen here were extremely professional and courteous.

<Review>I've been to the indoor repair shops at the mall and they were pushy with a high price for a repair.I also went to the one at banning by the barbershop and the guy was extremely rude.. I finally went to Fixology and the owner helped me out. Such great customer service and reasonable price! He finished it within 15 minutes and to top it off, I received free Starbucks (: I highly recommend this place!!! (:<//Review><user>105302498587956755407</user>< rate>

The service was great and it was fast, plus the representative, Danny, was very helpful and knowledgeable of everything that I asked  him regarding my IPhone.

I recommend anybody who had their screen cracked to come over to Cabazon and get it repair in Fixology! It was cheaper than going through my insurance and the end product looked and felt brand new.< /review>

<Text>I usually don't do reviews. . .but I had to do one for this business. Erick & his brothers are truly the team! They went beyond what I expected and made 2 of my iphones work. They spent a couple hours trying to figure out how to get through to one of my iphones and while being there they were friendly, kind and funny. They are young but really smart and reliable. The best part is the prices are cheap & they have a pool table!!! Freaken AWESOME!!!
Thank you once again for taking quality time on fixing 2 of my devices and my sister devices too!!! :))
Will definitely be back. . . once i find my other iphonePLUS! LOL< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I ordered a factory replacement glass with fixology and was promised to have my part in 3-5 days. I ordered this part Monday because I needed to repair the back glass to receive my switcher credit from AT&T which would expire Saturday a total of $400. They said worse case scenario would be Saturday because I ordered it on Monday.  They required 50% deposit at the time of the order.  Fast forward to Saturday 2:30 PM no call for my glass.  I called to find out where my part is and the guy tells me oh it looks like there was a delay in the shipping it won't come until tomorrow.  My trade in switcher credit was expiring that day and I had communicated this to them on Monday. Knowing how important it was for me to get my glass they fully ignored that and just told me it's not thier fault it's the shippers fault and there is nothing they can do.  I expressed my discontent and asked for a refund at that point the fix was useless.  Get this, I get a call from the owner himself Mr. Big shot Sunday while I'm trying to watch football and instead of apologizing for screwing me up bigtime $400 screw up, he tells me hey I don't appreciate how you talked to my technician I would have done something for you yesterday but I didn't like that, and it's not our fault anyway it's Fed Ex's fault, and I promise you it didn't cost you $400.  Woah really dude call me a liar too on top of it?? Push the blame on some one else? It's your business Mr Big shot not Fed Ex's. I didn't use foul language or raise my voice I just told the technician man I needed this today to get my credit I want a refund now. I don't need this tomorrow.   Mr Big shot said well I didn't like your tone.  I said dude, put yourself in my shoes you just lost $400 because of your poor service how would your tone be?  Saturday the technician should have called Mr Big Shot to see how they can help me the paying customer who is always right! They actually should have called me earlier during the week knowing the circumstances and said my product was on delay.  This is what happens when mommy opens a business for you and you let stuff get to your head.  You need to grow up Mr Big Shot and do the right thing for your customers.  By the way this is the first review I have ever written in my life because I couldn't believe the nerve of Mr Big Shot and how they handled this. Unbelievable!!!

I'm editing this review because the lack of accountability and retaliation.   The Owner who I referenced as Mr Big Shot replied with lies about how I did business as a banker and mentioned where I work.  That's what happens when you let a kid run a business who hasn't matured.  I would have my manager approve fees waived for him all the time.
He never apologized for the mistake and retaliation on his part and has the notion he doesn't need to build long term relationships or the need for repeat customers.  Treat everyone as you expect to be treated and your business can and will exceed expectations. Oh and by the way I'm no longer with Wells Fargo because I quit after they got sued for fraudulent activity.  Everyone who did business with me knows I keep the customer first and always did what was right.  I went to Chase as a Private Banker and you don't get to that level unless you are the best at what you do, and provide top notch customer service.   You look like an idiot retaliating like that and it shows how immature you are.  You never treat customers like this.  Your little brother wouldn't have been so terrible at baseball if you spent some time with him like I did showing him how to hold and swing the bat.   My son will attest to this in fact he got his first hit the day I showed him how to hit.  Way to go dude your awsome!< /text>

<resp>{'time': 1546738797819, 'text': 'Gabe,\n\nThank you for putting the time into writing this BIASED review. This was my FORMER banker at Wells Fargo in Beaumont off 2nd street. Reasons why he is no longer with the company . . . I think this review says enough. Wells Fargo knows Fixology and has had work done by Fixology, and can testify this is not an accurate representation of Fixology. This is NOT the way Fixology treats its customers.\n\nHis son and my brother were in the same little league baseball team for crying out loud. Gabe used his relationship with me to put himself on a higher pedestal and wrongfully treat one of my technicians. Customers are NEVER ALWAYS RIGHT. With a mentality as such, a customer will never treat an employee proper. Customers should ALWAYS RECEIVE THE UPMOST RESPECT AND REGARD no matter the circumstance. And this idea that I hold onto so strongly Gabe, goes vice versa.\n\nNow please go find better things to do than hate and bash a young entrepreneur who has earned an honest living for HIMSELF and by HIMSELF.\n\n- Mr. Bigshot\n\nEric C.\nCell: 951-313-2293\nEmail: fixology@fixology0013.com'}< /resp><GmapID>0x80db408df521cf1f:0x9726579ac8524176<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1567825879891, 'text': 'Abel, we take feedback very seriously here on a review by review basis. We keep record of every customer for our lifetime manufacture warranty we offer on every repair, and I cannot find your profile on our system or on any of our backups. This review was also written during our transition period from our old location at the outlets from May to June. Another repair business moved into our kiosk 2 weeks after we left. If we are mistaken and you did indeed have a repair here with us and did not meet exceptional expectations, please contact us at 951-313-2293 or at Fixologytechrepair@gmail.com to quickly resolve this. Thank you!'}</Response>

It's always nice to see the Russian River from a different perspective!
This is a safe place to take photos & walk across to view the R.R...</text>

<review>Park is pretty but very difficult access to the river.  Dangerous really.  Took my dog there after googling dog parks.  No fence for dogs but nice walking paths except for the people that were inhabiting the park.  One guy stumbled out of the bathroom with his pants zipper down and his parts out.  Ok that could happen to anyone forgetting but my very sweet dog was as disturbed as I was.   Relieved to see a couple walking in the park.  But bicycle riders were riding up to the table the couple decided to sit.  Some presents he was handing out to the grown men riding kids bikes?
Nice views of the river through wooded trees and a blanket of leaves covered a wooded area which had the smell of fall.  Then a path in high grass that seem to lead to Drake Road seemed interesting and my dog wanted to check it out.   Seemed a couple of guys made up a pretty good set up with grill, tents, beds...I figured one was the one that hangs out in town because of the wheel chair.  I was politely given a courteous hello.  Gave it one star because of dangerous access to the river and no place for dog to go off leash.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< UserId.>

<review>It's the best place in the world everyone is nice even the homeless they will help u out as much as they can. And they always have a smile on there face. Now the Sharifs were the only problem they came down like a army looking for trouble that's the only bad part that I didn't like my kids r having nightmares now. But other then that it was awesome.</review><name>Mebe ant< /name><Time>1529450398200</Time>< rate>

It only has one small barbeque down in the picnic area. There is a large one in the family area. It is rather rustic.<//Review>

Always the same nasty drunk guys.  It's scary. Every time I go there's a small guy named Nick drinking himself to death. He must live there.  Why is public drunkenness tolerated here?< /review>

Excellent friendly service.  Larry, the man, know what he is doing with pride.  I went to Walmart and Home Depot for 10 duplicated keys.  None of them worked.  Google it and found this Fresno Mobile Key on E McKinley Ave.  Long drive across town but worth the time.  $2.50 each key is less expensive than Home Depot.  Done with professional quality.  Yes, all 10 of them worked as they should be.  Thanks Larry and the Man (I didn't get his name) who has 55 years in locksmith. THANK YOU!<//text>

All in all they got the job done.
They came out to me to give me a new key and to program it. The new key was defective so they ordered me one and told me it would be ready by Tuesday ANYTIME after 11AM. I called Tuesday (after 11AM) to see when I can come in and I was told they hadn’t gone through any of the new shipments so they would give me a call when it was ready. On Thursday night (basically two days later) I got a text message from the mobile guy who originally came out to get me a new key and program it, saying my key was ready and they forgot to call me. Not the most professional but whatever, I was just ready to have my key that I already paid $320 for. The customer service over the phone wasn’t the best, the person I spoke to seem like she was in quite the rush to get off the phone but coming into the actual store I had a MUCH better experience. The two gentlemen working inside were great. Very polite, welcoming, and straight down to business but without being rude about it. Only giving 3 stars because lack of communication on their end. Other than that, they were great. I will definitely use them again if I have to and will recommend them.<//text>

<resp>{'time': 1606640803073, 'text': 'Thank you for the opportunity to give you service and your positive review. To be clear the $320 was for a lost key situation with no key present and you received 2 keys, FOBIK and Bladed Key,  both programmed to start the vehicle. I see no mention of the $60 discount to make  2 keys for the locked truck toolbox for under $15 which usually requires replacing the locks. Thank you again for the business and we look forward to working with you in the future. Happy Holidays.'}</resp><gmapID>0x80945de0819a38e3:0xe6014069a1eb5aa3</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Really good prices. Just horrible customer service. Would have been great experience if I would have been helped by one of the 5 people their and only 1 was actually helping another customer while the rest of them were on their phones. Took me 15 minutes to get a key programmed but 40 minutes for me to get helped. I was going to leave but the price was really good other places I've been to charge way more.</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The Manager was extremely responsive and very professional. Very knowledgeable. He told me the types of locks I needed to buy and walked me through the process. He was punctual and did the work well. Very courteous.<//review>

POOR customer service, no return calls. we have been waiting for them to follow thru with their promises for work to be completed for 2 weeks already.

Great locksmiths with great prices.  These guys are an honest family that bring great business to Fresno county. They'll come to you or you can go to them.  They're easily found on McKinley between Millbrook & First street.
Give these guys your business, you won't be disappointed. 😉</Review>

I called all over Fresno looking for someone to open a locked box for me (I lost the key to my secret box).  Most places were going to charge me $50-$60 to open the box for me.  I called Fresno Mobile Key on a Sunday late afternoon, 30 minutes before they closed.  The key man was really helpful; he told me to bring my box in right away.  They worked so hard passing their closing time to open my box for me.  Their dedication to help me with opening my box was priceless!  They were professional, knew what they were doing; and only charged me $20!  Opened my box and made me a brand new key!!!  I highly recommend this family owned key service place.  I will definitely come back if I ever need any lock/key services.< /text>

Walt (owner) and his grandson were great.  Got my keyless entry key fob programmed quickly and for so much less than the dealership wanted to do it.  Would be 5 stars if there was any parking but that is no big deal.< /text>

Went in today with some blank keys I bought online to have cut. They didn’t give me any grief about not buying it through them. They simply let me know that they couldn’t guarantee the keys if they didn’t work. After cutting the three keys I tested them out and they all worked without a problem! Their prices are far below other local locksmiths in town. Honest work for an honest price. I’m definitely coming back for any auto locksmithing needs.<//text>

This situation was you wanted to save money on having multiple parts in a door replaced and didn't want to buy new OEM parts at a cost of $600. In this case we recommend using a self service wrecking yard or purchasing a parts door from a full service dismantling company to obtain parts. Seems to me your resolve was similar to our recommendation. Instead of having us install the parts you used the company in the parking lot of the wrecking yard.

Follow up from earlier today, trunk lock for 95 honda civic indoor trunk lock. I called Lehman's Lock & Safe Service & Repair on Shaw and first. They went above and beyond to help me. They even pulled the lock from my physical trunk to match the code and also opened and pulled the tumblers to verify it would match my interior trunk key lock. And it did!!! Happy day!! Guess how much it cost? instead of $46 plus tax that Fresno Mobile Key wanted to charge,  Lehman's was $4.00 plus i tipped him $6 for a total of $10.

Thanks Lehman's!!

Just got off the phone with a guy about a key being made for my vehicle they quoted me a price range. So I asked him is there any way to find out if my key has a transponder and he said no. So I told him I'll Google it and find out and he said I won't.  I just so happen to Google it and hopped on one of the Lexus forums. I found out that my key does has a transponder. To whomever answered the phone, you my friend are a huge ding a ling.<//text>

Your vehicle is a split year and it may or may not contain an immobilizer system requiring a transponder key. There is no way for you to read a forum post and know. As mentioned on the phone, only the dealer by VIN lookup could tell you if anyone. Most people appreciate the honesty of being told its optional and giving a true and accurate price before placing service. I noticed the cost difference was not mentioned. We are $1000.00 cheaper on average for a transponder key for your vehicle than the dealer.'}<//response><gmap_id>0x80945de0819a38e3:0xe6014069a1eb5aa3</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am extremely happy with this company - i called everywhere , even the manufacturer that made my vehicle and all i got was excuses, high quotes and no guarantees to have it fixed in less than a week.
Fresno Mobile Key quoted me on the phone - arrived within 30 minutes, made a new key - uploaded codes and were gone in less than an hour.
Thank you Fresno Mobile Key!</Text>< Resp>

<Text>Great little place to go if your in need of a spare key for your home, car, and locks. Verry mindful of their customers and willing to talk to you while you wait for your key. They'll tell you the prices and they are much lower than the dealership's prices for a keys thats for sure. Had my 2003 honda civic keys copied and ready for me in half an hour. Best part of this experience was that i had a great time waiting for my keys.< /Text>< username>

Took three days for them two make my key and then had problem with key and took it back to them and they said I never bought the key from them. Place sucks and they are really slow. I rather pay more and get it done right. They are very cheap but don't go two them go some where else cuz they are rip off when it comes two having them fix there mistake. They didn't even give me a receipt. They are rip off warning u!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I paid 120 for a key that's a piece of shi*****</Review>

{'time': 1475018760812, 'text': "The exact amount was $117.97 according to receipt. We special ordered a RKE (Remote Head Key) for customer's Honda over 2 months ago. Customer called last night and insisted the key was deprogrammed from his vehicle. We explained that was not possible and to drive the vehicle into our shop and we would look at it free. The moment I looked at the customer's key I noticed the plastic had been pried on and the screw was missing. I told him he had lost the transponder and the key could not start the vehicle without it. I offered to fix his problem for $45 ($10 Transponder  $35 Program Fee). He decided not to have it done."}<//resp>

<review>My experience was very pleasant.  They took me me quickly without a appointment and their work is exceptional for a reasonable price.  I'm pleased with my experience from start to finish.

They take walk ins or you can book an appointment. My experience here was really great. It was quick and my nails came out cute! They have good services. It's alright for its prices.<//Review>

If you are looking for a basic manicure for a normal price this is a good option to go. Not a cheap salon, not exclusive. Everything was pretty standard. They removed my old polish, buff my nails, did some cuticle treatment and lotion. Result is very satisfactions and I love the shape.</review>

She was able to fit me into her schedule on a short notice which I was very grateful for because my nails looked horrible (done previously by someone else). She fixed the mess they made and left them looking beautiful.
Thank you May for the exceptional service! It was a pleasure meeting you and I will definitely be going back to you from now on.</text>< Pics>

<Review>I just went and sat for an hour and they ask why I was sitting there? I even called to say what I wanted. I waited because it was the only place open. Never going back I never got my nails done .BAD COMMUNICATION with staff and customer.

First, the service is slow. They take forever to get your order. They charge $2.99 for a bean burrito.  With extra sauce they wanted $5.04. SCREW THAT.  I can go across the street to in and out and get a meal for $1.25 more. I hope others realize you're gouging and stop going.</text>

Burger King was fine. Good family service. The people next door in Taco Bell though, lazy, unambitious, didn't open, had attitude. Burger King was up and running serving customers as can be professionally expected. Taco Bell very slow in responding, did not fulfill a 10-minute waiting time. When I left they were still not open. The manager of the Travel Center needs to be told this.</text>

Personally my visite was pleasant. The eating area is nice and clean.
The two stars are because the prices are so high.</review>

<review>This place is sandwiched between to other fast food chains. The employee  (gentleman) showed no sign of life, had the tough guy face on. Seemed more annoyed to be at work than to help the customers. Besides the overpriced menu, this place only gets customers because it's the ONLY Taco Bell within 30 mile radius. This place stinks when it comes to genuinely serving customers, I felt like had I said anything but Hi the employee would of gave me a dirty look. Avoid this place and get your burritos elsewhere!!

< Review>
Placed my usual order and the price was nearly double any other Taco Bell I've ever been to. What a waste of time stopping here. I'll pass 10 more in the next half hour heading north from here and none of those would be such a ripoff. Seems like the type of place that gives a kickback to tour bus drivers so they can fleece the passengers. Stay clear.< /Review>

They reason for the higher prices is because it's being runned by the TA and not taco bell itself. The food is good as well as the service will continue to come back</text>

I walk in close to Closing time And I was greeted with the smile and hello, right away walking in I felt this was the safe environment.to The workers had mask throughout the store was precautions put up with glass shields and markers to keep help guide your distance. The service Was Professional, Fast,and very well mannered. I have received this Treatment Not only today,But in the past and I know I'll received the same treatment in future. It's just 1 of those places You know it's gonna be all right.
Thank you Auto Zone!
One Happy customer, Mario R. Anduha SR.

Fantastic service! The staff treats professional or the weekend newbies, each with the same professional service and respect. I was able to put a deposit down and borrow their tools that made; changing my brake pads possible, saving me a couple hundred dollars . Returned the tool and received my deposit back , it was a win win guy and gals!  I know it is hard at time to ask for assistance, I basically told them I was an idiot, then, they went out of their way to help me to be able to begin and complete my project< /review>

<Date>1435475152995< /Date><rate>5</rate><Text>Eric S. helped us out today and went above and beyond. My wife and I were halfway through an 8 hour drive to our vacation when a bump on the I-5 managed to tear the flap acting as a shield to our bumper. Normally this is a dealership or body shop fix. Eric spent 45 minutes problem solving with us on how we could safely fix it until we could get to a body shop without putting the car at risk. He even helped (read: did all the real work) install the pieces for us, and in the end, it was a cheap fix for us -- even though he spent 45 minutes in 90+ degree heat.

You really couldn't ask for better customer service. Seriously, if you're in the area and need anything, my absolute recommendation is to find Eric S. and ask him for help.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Love this place, especially the tacos de papa special on Tuesdays. I recently went vegan and they were willing to accommodate me. Their salsa is great, especially verde. The guac is incredible, though if you don't finish in one day, don't forget to stir in a bit of lemon juice<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Time>1603763210191< /Time><Text>It was okay. Ready quick, convenient, food was hot, reasonable price, but not a particularly stellar set of tacos. I had a shredded beef taco 🌮 which came in a hard shell (ugh), and a fish taco 🌮 in a soft shell with good sauce, but the fish was greasy and a bit over cooked. I'd eat there again in a pinch. Maybe tacos aren't their specialty.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmap_id>

Very delicious tacos, with Tuesday special, you can taste different flavors with a reasonable price. Chicken and beef tacos are my choices.</Review>

<Text>The entree's here were all pretty good, but I'll say that their carne asada dishes seemed to be a bit dry. Their beans and rice also taste a bit dry, so that's a pitfall.

However, their breakfast burrito is on point the best one I've had here in San Diego. The cheese is perfectly melted, the food is distributed so you can get a taste of everything in every bite, and you can swap out the bacon for sausage (which is a big deal for me, sorry bacon lovers!)

The next amazing thing here is their fish tacos, which they're known for. Perfectly battered, doesn't taste like you're eating bread the whole time. Solid fish taco, definitely a go to place for the area.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I'm a very big fan of CVS it's the only pharmacy that I've used for the past two decades this specific CVS the manager is extremely rude and arrogant and seems to pretend and behave like he's above and better than all the customers and clients that come in to the store. It seems to be the big trend these days people in retail stores abusing their authority</review>

They have two prices for eye drops. $7 and $12. Not the yellow price that requires their garbage membership either. They have two separate locations for the same item with a different price and they could not honor the $7 price they advertise. Pretty shady.< /Review>

<Text>Signage states that the store is supposed to be open 24 hours a day and that the pharmacy opens at 8AM. Neither is true. No temporary sign posted listing modified hours, so there's really no reasonable excuse.</Text>< Pics>

I like how this CVS has vamped their store up a notch with a recent makeover. The staff here is always friendly and quick especially Cheong, Dennis and Jacob, are great. And up to date items for the detailed shopper are nicely displayed throughout.</text>

I love the store and all the employees are 'm. They do get busy and caught off guard but it's not long before help arrives. I have been to all the other CVS stores in this area and this one is the best by far I won't go any where else. The managers are great well all but one, everyone is so helpful and
they make you feel welcome and important every time. You should be so very proud of your hire and training crew except they need to stop transfering the Great Managers and Clerks to other stores we need them more. Every time the store is running perfect and smooth someone comes and screws it all up and everyone suffers. When some thing is perfect don't mess with it and you'll be surprised how many more good responses you will get to the complaints.<//Review>

Pharmacy techs are rude, do not attend to the phones, they just answer and put you on hold. I am reporting to corporate because this isn't the first time, nor the first CVS pharmacy to do this. We all have crappy jobs where people are nagging, but we all cannot treat people the way they treat their customers. It's a hit and miss when you get a good tech, or if they are in a good mood. If I acted like them I would be fired. Surprised they dont' get reprimanded.</review>

I was checking at night, and found out at the moment when it was my turn to pay, that some mysterious item showing up in the list but I never pick. I asked the cashier what was that. Surprisingly, it took a long time for the young man to give me an explanation. Then he found some excuse to rescanned all my items, this time in an honest way.
Just watch out the items showing on your bill!<//text>

it even exists is a near miracle. Last week when I was at the pharmacy counter picking up prescriptions, this guy came out from the back and I could tell he had just put on his name tag or badge or whatever and once he saw that there was a big line and people were getting impatient, he ducked out and went back to the back! I could not believe my eyes!< /Review>< Pictures>

Nevertheless in a pinch the CVS is more than adequate,  the pharmacy: depending on what time of day you visit expect Long lines and even longer delays. This store is clean and tidy everything's in order it doesn't smell and there's plenty of parking, at the same time it's also close to a Starbucks, Ross,  Staples or OfficeMax I forget which of the two.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I find the staff very helpful and pleasant. The problem with this pharmacy is that CVS does not have enough pharmacists working there. Yes, it is a heavily trafficked pharmacy in there is often a wait but, CVS should take that into account and hire more pharmacists.<//review>

Nice people but always a wait even if script was sent in a day before....Expect a wait of 15 min even if you are the only one there🤔<//Review>

<text>The pharmacy is unnecessarily slow and incredibly disorganized. Every visit to date,
I've been there for a minimum of 30 minutes  just waiting in line. The staff moves painfully slow without regard to the number of people waiting. Service is terrible.<//text><Rate>1< /Rate>< Resp>

This is not a very good CVS as far as service and complete product offerings. As an example, I went looking for a flosser and they only had replacements, but not the item, nor a slot or SKU for the item. I went to buy a gallon of water, and the cheapest one was $1.29. Checkout is generally slow and understaffed, and the layout is very awkward. It is open 24 hours, which is the main upside, and they have most of they typical items.</Text>

TERRIBLE customer service
The pharmacist was rude and unhelpful
Do not go there.

I waited over an hour to get my prescription filled and she was NOT nice to me or any of the other people in line.< /Review>

Exceptional service. Exceptional food. The entire staff was welcoming, friendly, & attentive. Their cleanliness protocol was commendable. The food came out very timely.  They kept our table clean after each course. I love everything about this dining experience. I dined with my 11 & 13 year old. Our server, Jack was amazing, he made great recommendations!< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>This was my first time going to this restaurant. My kids took me for Mother's day.. The food was delicious. I had the king crab, the crab fried rice, and the noodles. Oh my gosh, I don't have words for how tasty everything was. Then to top it off we had ice cream for desert that was made at the table side in front of us. It was so exciting to watch. Everyone that worked in the restaurant was so kind, and attentive. I will definitely recommend to all. The prices are a little higher, but definently worth it. What a great experience.</Review>< pics>

I've wanted to try this restaurant, and the garlic noodles, for a long long time (decades) but I just never made it to LA/BH,  until Saturday!!! I was excited to finally have the chance. Due to traffic, I had to cancel my reservation and settle for take out. I ordered from the 'An The Go' menu: chicken roll, shaken beef, garlic noodles. The chicken rolls have a strong shrimp/fishy taste. I didnt taste or detect any actual chicken flavor. You get 4 pieces (2 rolls cut in half on the diagonal) and a dipping sauce (NOT sweet and sour). I ate 2 pieces and gave the rest to my son. The fishy taste was too much for me. The shaken beef was very good. Not $42 good, but good. The meat is super tender, cooked perfectly, and the sauce is sweet and savory. The potatoes were good but burned on the bottom. They put the salad (lettuce and halved cherry tomatoes) in a separate container with a side of dressing. The dressing tasted like balsamic with a hint of fish sauce. The garlic noodles were very tasty. Tender noodles with a strong buttery garlic flavor. I really enjoyed the noodles but they overpower anything you eat with them. Its 2 days later and I'm still eating noodles. I enjoyed the meal overall but I dont ever have to go back. My total for 3 dishes was $89. Way too much for what you get. I can check Crustacean off my list of "MUST TRY" restaurants.< /review>

<review>Crustacean Beverly Hills in summation, was disappointing. After completing the screening process (disguised as a reservation process), including email correspondences with the reservation team and the required submission of my friend's credit card information, our party was still greeted with news of no confirmed reservation upon our arrival to the restaurant. After an arduous process in which more challenges than solutions were presented, we were seated on what can only be described as the street corner. While our service, servers and food was phenomenal, this restaurant (selected to celebrate a friend's birthday), did everything but foster a celebratory environment.</review>< response>

The service was excellent the food was terrible ESPECIALLY for the price range. My $68 Lobster was over cooked very tough with no flavor or sauce very dry. The steak benedict was ground meat not a steak. I would NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone< /text>

Sushi plates are the best. Also go for lobster vs the shrimp.<//Text>

Holy Molly batman, probably the dining experience of the year. We sat where the bar used to have happy hours, the best seat in the house..ordered the Tuna Cigars..delivered in a cigar box and when the box is opened smoke pours out and inside the tuna is rolled in a wrapper with black caviar on one end...WOW. The balance of the meal was as special. Servers... great conversations and friendly. Take the one you love the most for an outstanding memory.< /review>

If you were going to write a book on restaurants that not only offer top quality food, customer service, and atmosphere, but also know how to adapt to provide every customer with an excellent experience, THE CRUSTACEAN would be the first chapter in that book.

I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. Every visit there is a delight and I am continually impressed with what they are doing!

SOME MUST TRY DISHES INCLUDE:
** Exquisite, delicious smaller morsels like their unique take on Avocado Toast, which surprises with flavor, texture, and punch
** Unceasingly addictive house famous Garlic Noodles
** Innovative, fluffy Pancake Soufflé'</Text>

<Review>This restaurant is actually pretty amazing with great food, it's definitely worth the hype. It's always the same type of people complaining in google reviews to get free food. Very pathetic, I hope the managers don't give these scammers the time of the day. Your employees are very polite and respectful. Keep up the good work. Will come back for sure :)<//Review>< Name>

Always an amazing experience, tiger prawns and garlic noodles have been my go to for 15+ years! Cigars and the hamachi are really good options for the appetizer!</Review>

<text>Crustacean did an incredible job on a to-go order for 20 meals last week!  They put together an amazing multi-course dinner menu with some of their signature dishes like their dungeness crab and garlic noodles along with a delicious cocktail. Everything was beautifully packaged and the food and drinks tasted even better. Would highly recommend ordering dinner to-go from Crustacean and can't wait to dine in-person soon.  Five stars all the way!<//text>< pictures>

The Mongolian lamb practically fell off the bone because it was so tender ( A must try)  The steak was incredible very well seasoned and the garlic noodles is a Oprah favorite and after eating them I understand you won't be disappointed.  The outside patio area has a beautiful wall of flowers that give it a romantic date night feel and the heating lamps will make you forget its winter.<//Review>

This place is worth all of the hype. The garlic noodles are buttery goodness. The crab was delicious. My husband had the steak and said it was better than Ruth's Chris. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Even the table side icecream was a great and tasty show.</Review>

<Review>Very recently reopened after months of renovation, the iconic restaurant is busier than ever. The new set up is softer, less ethnic than previous but seem to accomodate more tables.

Cleaner, softer looks and feminine contemporary designs are spotted everywhere. Menu is organized well with the classics clearly highlighted and newer menus featured and explained well by the staffs.. For us, the classics still fare the best. Avoid the beef as the medium well tasted more like well done. Complicated by the table presentation also not very guest friendly as the hot plate's supposedly 500 degrees hot.

Dessert was divine, we reordered the beignets and caramelized banana. I totally get how the restaurant could maintain so many loyal patrons over decades...they really understand that dining there would and should be a treat...</Review>< Time>

<Review>On September 27, 2020, I celebrated my birthday for a second year  at this restaurant. Not excluding I have  patronized this restaurant before the remodeling, after the remodeling, and during COOVID. When it was time to pay for my bill I payed with my  EDD card because I was on medical leave from my job because my hand was fractured hand on  May 17,2020.If anyone is on medical leave form their job they are eligible to apply for state disability to assist with loss of wages if you do not have sick pay, etc.  The waiter asked for my ID to process my card. However, when I ordered a glass of wine I was not asked for my ID. Nonetheless, I felt disrespected because I believe he associated me with the EDD fraud claims that have been happening in California. However, the EDD fraud has nothing to do with me nor did I commit EDD fraud to obtain my EDD card.  I have had my EDD card since the end of May.Furthermore, I payed for my meal with my other debit card and was not asked for my ID to process the payment. I plan to no longer patronize this business and would suggest all African Americans/black people to do the same.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bc083e0b1f21:0x76acc62a27588a38<//gmap_id><resp>None</resp>< user_id>

Once again, one of the restaurants of the House of An went over and above when it comes to flavour of the dishes served.  Most of what we ordered was well worth the price from the crab puffs to the A5 wagyu.
Of course the garlic noodles and garlic crab's flavour are wonderful as always, it's just that the crab meat was not as big as they used to be.  Its like they were just scraps or crumbs of previous served dishes that were put together.  Didn't even find a good sized leg meat, I hoped we ordered the ones still in their shell and just deshelled it ourselves. The shaken beef was divine. I can still remember the flavour.
The ambiance is always nice as well as the staff. Will definitely go back again and again.
Excited to try the new restaurant upstairs which I heard is good too and owned by the same family.  Now we have two more new House of An restaurants to try in SoCal, Dalat Rose and Tiato. 🥰<//Review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I’ve been going to crustacean for 20 years. On Mother’s Day they had a special in which they did not honor. The manager and the part owner were extremely rude when I demanded they honor the special they advertised. The part owner told me he is the omega and I can’t speak to anyone higher that him. He also went so far as to say he could careless who I tell about the treatment he gave me. He said tell who ever you want. I don’t care. The next few days they pulled the same scam on my friend however honored her request when she demanded they honor their advertisement. When she got her order not only did they not honor the advertisement as agreed they purposely didn’t put items in her bag she paid for. Crustacean customer service has gone down tremendously over the years and I will never step foot in the establishment again after the horrible treatment I received. The phone calls with the Manager and the part owner left me in tears for a few days. That is how bad they treated me.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

OMG.... Crustacean Beverly Hills is fantastic. Beautiful décor and incredibly delicious food. I love the koi pond below the floor. Yes, I literally wanted to sit down on top of the glass and do some Koi Watching (It's a thing, right?). Too bad my suit pants were too tight for me to bend that far down. They got lucky! It was quite a relaxing evening. The fresh flowers all over the restaurant add a great touch. I often drifted from conversation and was distracted by the smell of food coming from nearby tables.

Be sure to email or go online to book your reservation ahead of time. I'm not sure they allow walk-ins. I did see a group of 4 walk in but were unable to get a table. It was slow when we arrived, but by 8pm nearly every table was occupied. It was a cold evening, so the outdoor seating was not in use. I noticed that they have seating upstairs too.

We started with drinks. I had The Ori. Strong drink, but not sure I'd get it again. Didn't quite satisfy me. I tried my friends Daughter of the Dragon and wish I had ordered that instead. Every item we ordered was full of spices and flavors. Our first dish was the Shrimp & Lobster Dumplings. These were very good. Our other 3 items arrived together: The Cauliflower & Brussel Sprouts, An's Famous Garlic Noodles, and the Lamb. The Cauliflower/Brussel Sprouts are amazing. Crispy and cooked to perfection. While the Garlic Noodles had all the right flavors, I thought it was a bit overcooked and too soggy. Lamb was tender and served with veggies. My dinner ended with a strong cup of Cappuccino.

Crustacean is certainly not a place to go if you're looking for big portions, unless you're planning to order plate after plate. Service was great, just as expected. My water was filled several times without having to ask. Sean was our server.

Valet parking is available. However, there are several public parking garages in the area.

Will I come back? YES!</text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Absolutely amazing place. Obviously on the expensive side but hands down one of the best spots in Beverly Hills, maybe even the extended Los Angeles area. Every dish we got was delightful. Highly recommend the Mongolian Lamb, Garlic Noodles, and basically any of the dim sum (we had quite a few and they were all fantastic). Also, the cocktails were amazing, great place for those too. Service was really great and personable, made good recommendations that were catered to our preferences. Great stuff, keep it up.</text>< Rating>

<Review>Beautiful venue with pretty good food. I was a dj here for a private event upstairs. I actually liked their appetizers more than the main meal 🤷🏻‍♂️ crab cakes and chicken meat balls were really good. I chose the salmon entree which was good, but pricey. Then again, it is Beverly Hills. A friend told me I should have chose a better item. Lol. There is free parking for 2 hours across the street as well. The staff was very friendly as well. If you’re a dj, I recommend bringing at least one speaker if you want to light up the party. Luckily I brought my system. Their system is good, but more for lounging.

<review>Introduction:

My best friend and all his relatives raved about this place and therefore I decided to pay this place a visit with my family last weekend to celebrate my mother's birthday. Out of the things we got for the evening the following deserves special mention: famous garlic roasted Dungeness crab with a side of garlic noodles, pho soup dumplings, and tuna cigars.

Food:

Garlic roasted Dungeness crab with a side of garlic noodles:

For the garlic roasted Dungeness crab I highly recommend getting it Out of Shell because it is much more convenient for consumption. The noodles, paired with the minced crab meat is buttery, garlicky and very flavorful. The texture of the noodles is al-dente and bouncy, signs that bespoke the noodles' quality.

Pho soup dumplings:

The pork inside the dumplings is very tender and tasty. The broth accompanying the dumpling is light, flavorful, mellow and wholesome. It's something I highly recommend getting on a cold night.

Tuna cigars:

The tuna cigars are a must have when visiting Crustacean. The initial presentation is eye-catching and innovative; the cigars themselves are delightful. The cigars consist of tobiko caviar at the tip with minced tuna on the inside wrapped in a thin wafer. Normally I don't like caviar because they tend to be too salty but the tobiko caviars, surprisingly, are mild in taste. I really enjoy the taste of the minced tuna: it has a pronounced smokiness to it with hints of spiciness.

Ambiance:

Elegant and contemporary in its décor.

Price:

It is reasonable considering the quality of its ingredients, culinary execution and its demographic location.

Service:

The staff is cordial and polite however they did commit a faux pas. Prior to coming I have made a reservation and the establishment understands my family and I are celebrating my mother's birthday for the evening. Upon arriving my mother is given a birthday card bearing a general message congratulating and wishing her well which we appreciate. However, by the end of the evening my mother is displeased with their service because when we arrive, a small cake bearing a lit candle is brought to the table next to us. When my mother sees that, since it is her birthday, she thought by the end of the meal the staff will bring a small cake to us as well to commemorate the event. Unfortunately the cake is never brought much to my mother's disappointment and she did complain about it for the rest of the night. To me it is carelessness if the cake were not brought by accident; if the cake were not brought deliberately because my family and I have not spent a certain amount for the evening, then it is a lack of commonsense on the staffs' and establishment's part. How much can a small cake cost? $7-$10 at most; the establishment can easily make it back with the patron's gratuity. It is not worth making patrons feel they have been treated unequally when a cake is brought to one table but not the other especially if both tables happen to be right next to each other.<//review>< rate>

<date>1487484515457< /date><rate>5<//rate><review>Had a date night here with the wife. Reservations are a must. We were seated right away and our server was very friendly. Parking was a bit difficult but that's expected in this neighborhood. The food was excellent and the service was great. We saw Ann but didn't say hi as she was too far away. We had a wonderful dinner and great drinks. You could tell that a great deal of care went into preparing the meal. We met another couple who was seated next to us and it was their first time as well. You would think that it would be a pretentious place,  but it wasn't. The food was great,  atmosphere was beautiful and the decorations were very nice as well. The Koi were very nice too. We had a great time and will definitely be back</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP091FcLVkIQ_XIgLWgisVBYha6vVbKWZOXW2wf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9owlJjE1pxw9ydW0bwrCAN7g3MDbWjXza4cJ2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I was excited about my order of the famous garlic noodles and crab everything seems perfect until the next day I ended up sick it did not sit well with my stomach. I’ve become nauseous throwing up uncontrollably I called in on Sunday after feeling a bit better and spoke to the manager Tom and requested a refund after explaining to him the situation he adds insult to injury by telling me I can call in if I like and report fraudulent charges he also said to me that he was for sure my order did not make me sick I’ve again asked to speak to another manager he told me he was the manager and the next step would be to talk to the owners he then hung up on me most definitely not a satisfying experience and to be treated in such a way by a manager of such an elegant restaurant I was shocked< /review></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful location and restaurant with easy to find parking. Ambiance, service and food was top notch! Unfortunately I wasn't able to dine in the dining area wearing a beanie but no biggie we sat at the bar. The bartenders & servers we're very attentive and made us feel very welcomed. Shout out to Daniel the bartender and rest of the crew. We ordered mussels, garlic fried rice, garlic noodles and red snapper. All the food looked very simple but Omg did it pack so much flavor. Less is definitely more and Crustacean proves this in the food they cook. Thank you for a great experience! Will definitely be back.<//review>

Stellar service, stellar food. They're back baby. They got some great new items on the menu. Solid new conceptualized drinks. The tuna cigars are presented in a cigar box with smoke trapped inside and black caviar to simulate the burnt end of a cigar. Ypu know what? Just go and see for yourself.< /review>

This is simply one of the best restaurants ever.  If you like Vietnamese/Asian dim sum and really anything you will love this,  Dessert was fabulous, which I didn’t expect.  I am a foodie, I have eaten all over the world, this place is a treat!< /review>

Not good. We felt compelled to order from here to support neighborhood restaurants during the crisis. We’d heard the food was good, the menu looked good, and it was our anniversary. What a mistake. Totally bungled three out of four dishes for our meal. Neglected my requests concerning food allergies. Substituted a dish. Ruined a $50 palate of pasta and tiger prawns. Portions were small. To top it off I contacted them after and requested some kind of solution. No reply. No thanks. Plenty of other great places to go.< /text>

< Review>
Our Order was missing items on Mother’s Day. My mother called and then they put her on hold and hung up on her no less than 4 times. I had to call and get surly with the staff to get anyone to speak with us.

Once I spoke with the manager he was incredibly rude! Then refused us a refund. We’ve been going to crustacean for over 15 years but the past 5 years their service has seriously declined.

It is a pity that crustacean’s service is not what it once was. Hope they get some better staff soon!

Additionally, our desserts had hairs in them, which is GROSS!!!</Review>

Fabulous crab from An's secret kitchen.  The garlic noodles are perfect.  Interesting and flavorful cocktails.  Great wine list.  Steak on a himalayan salt slab cooked perfectly and full of flavor.  Relaxing atmosphere and incredible service.  What can i say, this is on my top five restaurants in Los Angeles.  If it were not as pricey, I would probably go far more often. Still, it never disappoints for a cocktail, appes or a meal. I bow in humility and appreciation for your talents, Mrs. An, Chef Tony and the entire staff.< /Review>

I cant stress enough how quality the food is and how punctualtbe staff is in delivering the food on time and not making us wait hours to get through a meal. That may bot sound like much but when your talking bgg g about restaurants where you spend this type of cash it's often rare that your able to get what you want and get on with your night in any reasonable time frame. Most places want to keep the liquor flowing in hopes that you'll keep adding to the tab. They are not like that at all. Which I for one appreciate.<//Review>< Time>

Good food.convenient parking and City structure across the street at fairly reasonable prices. Good for a splurge ordering dineLA specials. Or for lunch on the patio if not too hot outside. Gorgeous play so check out the interior.<//review>

< Review>
The ambiance is beautiful, great service and the food is fantastic. We had the cigar tuna rolls; the presentation of that was very exotic. The garlic noodles and crab were delicious. I tried the eggplant  and that was very good. For dessert we had the beignets (supper tasty) and the flan. Top notch experience. Just go!< /Review>

<Review>The ambiance is perfect. Lighting is soft, music is non intrusive and service is courteous and informed. The wine glasses are very generous, definitely a plus. However, the food takes itself a bit too seriously! My prawns were over cooked and as a result a bit dry. The fried rice was warm instead of hot so the egg did not blend in. I was slightly disappointed only because of all the hype behind the place. Maybe it was an off day... Nonetheless, highly recommend for a romantic date or a special occasion. The best and most impressive menu item is by far the tuna cigars. Not to be missed. I wish we had had room for dessert.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Not as expected. I’ve been a long time customer of Crustacean San Francisco and must say the crab in SF is so much better and tastier. The crab here was overly garlicky but missed salt and pepper necessary to take the crab over the edge. The SF crab is a mix of garlic, salt and pepper and sooooo good. The ambience is nice with the coi fish. Service was excellent.<//Text>< response>

<rating>4</rating><review>I absolutely love love love the crab! (and I'm not a crab lover). It is one of my all time favorite meals, easily in the top 3.  I hadn't been there for about two and a half years and the first words out of my mouth when I tasted the crab was "I have missed this crab" :-) the service was excellent, and my wife says the waiter was hot LOL. I took one star away because I really don't like the new decor and I felt it detracted from the overall experience. Everyone should experience the crab 🦀 😍</review><user_name>Greg Saccone</user_name></record>

<text>I have to say, their signature Dungeness crab with garlic noodles is my go-to dishes. I've been dining here for years. I remember when their price used to be $60 for them to shell out the crab, and now it's $78. The flavor of the crab meat is mouth watering. And the garlic noodles are so good. We will be back soon.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Food was good but service was terrible!  The wait staff  brought us food we did not order. When informed of the mistake, he simply got mad and raised his voice!  And this is not the end of it. When the bill came, we ended up getting charged for the item that was never consumed.  When confronted again, this waiter replied with the dirtiest look he could give and walked off.  We were celebrating a birthday and didn’t really look at the corrected bill too too closely and took off.  This morning we realized that Evian showed up on the bill while we only consumed tap water.  WOW!  Be careful!  While the food is good, the service really really sucks and would I recommend this place?  NO!  Not till they clean up their wait staff team!  BEWARE OF THE RIP OFF!</Review>

<review>What a shame I have to write this because the food was good but boy are they rude and scammy. I ordered a drink and they got it wrong, and then upcharged me to fix it. My boyfriend ordered a house drink and substituted tequila for mescal. They charged for the substitution and then *also* upcharged for the highest shelf liquor without asking us what we wanted. When we asked to speak to the manager he was rude and condescending and mansplained that he “runs the bar program” and talked over us. He finally removed the extraneous charges after a lengthy and uncomfortable conversation. We can’t in good conscience dine there again and I would advise the owner to hire a competent manager because other reviewers seem to have also had bad experiences with management.</review><user_name>Petra W.< /user_name>< user>

< Review>
David is a 5 star waiter - give him a promotion and raise! He saved Crustacean’s reputation for me. David works the tables by the bar. He sets an example of how to serve and treat customers well, regardless of their social status (which is seldom the case for the Crustacean’s standard). David recommended great drinks and dishes, which he served up quickly. What a class act!  Great service and food (6/1/19). Thanks David, my birthday was fun and welcoming!< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Ew. I’ve come to Crustacean for years...actually since I was 15 years old. I took my girlfriend here for a drink after dinner at Il Pastaio as my family is friends with the bartenders and a few servers here and I WAS NOT LET IN BY THE DOORMAN. John or Josh was his name I believe. Very pretentious and proud of his job protecting the door for no apparent reason.He wouldn’t even allow me to walk in...? There were 3 open seats at the bar and all we wanted was a drink. Not coming back.< /review>< Pictures>

The special noodles they have that are like $40 are hilariously plain... is just a decent place charging super high end prices so we wouldn’t go back except to show people a cartoon version of what a “Beverly Hills” person is. holy sweet mercy, the outrageous 37 year old Russian gold digger with botched plastic surgery  taking 100 selfies of her pursed lips while her fat 60 year old balding Armenian date is in the bathroom... is real... like these tv show cliches are REAL at this restaurant.

<Review>I've been going there for years, always thought it was a great place, but now that they remodeled, I think it is an exceptional place.  The owners really have a good eye, and the food is amazing on top of it.  Great atmosphere, can't think of anything bad to say, highly recommend from me.< /Review>< GmapID>

I made a birthday reservation for myself and one of  my closest friends. I had not been to Crustaceans since the remodel so I was super excited to see the new renovation as well as enjoy the garlic noodles and Salmon. The food did not disappoint however our male server with the blonde short hair was condescending, rude and was annoyed when we asked questions about the menu and past items that were no longer on the menu.  He appeared to be slightly racist and it totally ruined my birthday and dining experience. The food gets 5 stars however the service was not what we expected from such an exquisite restaurant. If you are not able to relate to all races you should not work at this establishment. I hope management reads this and reiterate to their staff about treating all customers the same regardless of race, ethnicity or other. Our money is being spent just the same.</text>

You have to order the “Cigars” (not actual cigars, they have tuna inside) are presented in the coolest way ever. My favorite are the vegan crab cakes even though I’m not vegan. They’re just so yummy. Also this restaurant is run by the most lovely family of sisters which gives it a very nice feeling as they come around from time to time to greet guests. One of my top 10 fav spots in LA for sure.</review><rating>5<//rating><gmap_id>0x80c2bc083e0b1f21:0x76acc62a27588a38</gmap_id>< Date>

< review>
Garlic noodles taste like upgraded ramen noodles (salty, umami, msg type flavor). It is pleasant to the palate but over salted and under seasoned. Has a dated sort of atmosphere. I had dumplings with truffle and did not taste the black truffle at all.</review>

<Text>Garlic noodles and the crabs...........YUMMMMM! I like the food, not so much the service, the happy hour menu is good and many high class Asian business people can be seen dinning inside. There is sometimes star sighting and the front desk can be either very nice or if busy some what inconsiderate. I like the place for the food! delicious and exotic</Text>< pics>

Exquisite in every detail. Fresh, whimsical, tantalizing cuisine that will keep this spot on the top of your "where to go" list when you want to impress. Established 20 years ago, Crustacean has celebrated itself with a beautiful new look and a fabulous shift in menu choices. Don't fret though, the garlic noodles are still on the menu and the koi are still swimming under the walkway. I loved this restaurant when it opened and I love it even more today.< /review>

First experience was okay. Food was overrated, though. Pho wonton did not have enough pho flavor like Vietnamese pho soup. Kung Pao eggplant was deep fried and too salty. I went the second time with my husband just because his friend would like to try Crustacean. We did not have as good experience as the first time.

Crustacean is Overrated. Poor food: I ordered chef An's lobster garlic noodle. The lobster was not fresh, garlic noodle was soggy. Basically, the food is overpriced with poor quality food taste. My husband and I came home feeling thirsty. MSG in the food?
In addition, the service was poor. The waitress did not ask if my husband and I would like to have more water.<//Review>

Excellent! We were graciously greeted and the staff immediately accommodated our request to sit outside on a beautiful sunny afternoon. We arrived between lunch and dinner and had a wonderful selection from the small plate/happy hour menu. The wine paired perfectly with our meal and the service was impeccable. Recommend wholeheartedly.< /Text>

This  restaurant offers a variety of noodles, from pho to ramen to Korean cold noodles. I ordered the #1 PHO with meatballs, rare steak, crunch brisket, tendon and tripe. I was pleasantly surprised...usually places that offer such a mixture only do everything okay.

It was a good comfort meal. They were also very generous with the toppings in the bowl, and bring out cilantro and onions in addition to the usual basil, bean sprouts and lime.</Text>

Food was great as always, ambience is wonderful.  Would've given it 5 stars, but my laptop was stolen from the trunk of my rental car last night while it was valeted.  Either they have unseemly characters working valet, or vehicles aren't being properly secured.  A disappointing end to a beautiful evening.<//Text>

I was looking for a cute place to have my birthday dinner and remembered I had this gift certificate from an event that I went to called Unforgettable Gala in December. I was able to book it 24 hours in advance last minute. I've been wanting to come to the newly remodeled Crustacean to check it out. The whole entire venue is so beautiful and has a sexy atmosphere.  They even had a birthday card special made for me signed by the chef that made me feel extra special. Everything we ordered was amazing, new items I have never tried before I'm so glad we came here. Every dish had beautiful presentation, and tasted perfect and amazing. This was definitely a VIP experience, service was immaculate.

Tuna Cigars- I was like wow, tasted like smoked cigars almost, but once bitten I can taste the caviar and toasted wrap tuna, love the whole presentation in the smoked box.

Truffle Hamachi- I always worry to order hamachi at a non Japanese restaurant, but this was amazing.

An's Famous Garlic Noodle- I actually came here for the infamous garlic noodles, tasted just the way I Remembered.

An's Famous Garlic Toasted Dungeness Crab- we had two ordered of this, it's just that good.

Prime All Natural Filet Mignon- it was cooked just right, very tender and juicy.

Karate Salad- our server recommended this, it was very tasty.

Beignets - I loved this, should've ordered a side of ice cream for this.

Chef Helene Classic Banana a la mode- this was so good we ate the whole thing. Very addicting.

Thank you Crustacean for making my birthday wonderful!!<//text>

What’s wrong with this place? I like the food and the decor so much that I was willing to give it a second and third chance, but the management and reservation system here are simply retarded. GUYS IT’S 2019 WHO ELSE MAKES YOU FILL OUT A CREDIT CARD AUTH FORM TO MAKE A RESERVATION AND ASKS FOR A COPY OF YOUR DL??? CAN YOU JUST USE RESY OR OPEN TABLE?

Too bad my family likes this restaurant so I have to put up with it. Last time though.< /review>

<Date>1535964966421</Date><review>They were very prejudice against three nicely dressed African American Men. They were told there dress code was not up to par. However three Asian men walked in and we're not definitely wearing the dress code but the allowed them to enter the dining area and there after 4 white american ladies came in wearing work out gear leggings and a sports bra only and they were allowed to dine in. If it wasn't my friend's birthday and she was looking forward to dining at this place I would have left.  I ordered a shrimp scampi dish and when I received my plate the food was cold.  The renovation Beautiful the service and food an F++.</review><Rate>1</Rate><username>Star Bell</username></record>

I called and and made reservation and letting them know it was my honeymoon. They tried to give us a very crappy table and we asked to move. Our server wasn't attentive AT ALL!! We asked for a manager and he went to the "White" table next to us instead of ours and said " I heard you needed a manager" they responded "No" I tried to get his attention and he just ignored me. When I finally did he was like "Oh nobody told me" to top it off our bill was $206 and they ran my card 4 times so I really paid $824. I had to call the bank and dispute the charges and all the manager could say is "Oh sorry but its to late for me to do anything, can I buy you a drink" SERIOUSLY!!!!! IT WAS MY DAMN HONEYMOON!!!  cant believe i spent it THERE!

<time>1552688090252< /time><rate>1</rate><review>Last night I took 12 of my family members here to celebrate my (our) father's 80th birthday. We all live in Beverly Hills and have been coming to Crustacean for years (often to celebrate birthdays and special occasions). This was the first time we have been asked to give a credit card number to hold the reservation which we found understanding as we are a large group. We love the food there and as usual it was superb. We ordered an abundant amount food (several rounds of appetizers) and 5 orders of the garlic shrimp (at $68/order) and 7 orders of the garlic crab (at $78/order) and several desserts. By no means is this a cheap dinner. We are not big drinkers, yet we each ordered at least 1 drink ($18-$26/drink) per person. At the end of the meal the waiter even commented that he was amazed at how much we ate. When I received the bill I was amazed that we were charged a flat rate of  $165/per person, plus tax, plus 18% gratuity and plus an additional 4% "administrative fee". I was told there was a minimum amount that was needed to be spent there because we were a party over 8 or 10 people.   When I asked the waiter how much the bill would have been had it been itemized on what we actually ordered, he said about $300-350 lower than the $2,400.00 I was charged.  I then asked why I wasn't told this at the beginning or even during the middle of the meal for even though we were stuffed maybe we would have tried something new and different or ordered a nice bottle of wine. I was given no acceptable response other than, "I am sorry". I found this policy to be extremely insulting and impudent. You don't charge enough? You need to gouge people more just because we choose to celebrate a special occasion at your establishment? I then inquired if I could just received a credit or gift card for the $300 balance as we do come there often. When the waiter said he couldn't I asked to speak with the manager who also confirmed that he had no "authority from the owner" to do what seemed like a very reasonable request considering we just spent $2,400.00 for one meal.  This establishment has no class or professionalism whatsoever. The ownership and management should be embarrassed over how they treated us. This morning I woke up thinking I should have gone outside and brought in 4-6 homeless people into the restaurant and fed them with $300 worth of their food.  I could have gone to any other restaurant in the city to celebrate my father's birthday and now wished I had. I will never walk into this place again! NOR should anyone else.  Horrible business etiquette. Shame on Crustacean</review>< Pictures>

<Review>The Crustacean experience is out of this world. The food, the drinks, the ambiance - you will not be disappointed. Everything is created with a perfected creative Vietnamese touch. Tuna cigars, dumplings, and Mama An’s famous garlic noodles are some of my favs to name a few.</Review>< time>

<Review>It’s not bad, but not as amazing as they make it look like it. I mean cmon, what kind of restaurant checks your social network? That’s just absurd. If I go here, I am clearly going because I know I can afford it and therefore I should be able to fit in. I got the reservation, but that whole process just seemed very unreasonable and superficial.

<time>1559584732081</time><Text>If I could give a negative 5 I wouThis place plays favorites by judging you by your looks or if you look like you have money. No doubt that we do have money but we don’t really dress loud like these basketball players and their wives. We came on time for our 9:30 reservation and we waited 15 mins to get seated and they asked us if the rest of our party was coming we stated that it’s only the two of us and not sure where they got 4 from. We were then seated at a table literally for 4 but split in half and had to co share with another couple and there was no space to even breathe and the poor couple heard everything we were saying same with them! I was lucky to be 110 lbs and my hubby regular sized I can only imagine if i was more and needed the space, it’s our first time and we’re friends of Ken from the one in SF so we thought we would give crustacean and try and since we are magnums and premier Landry members at Mastro’s and Flemings thought we would try some new things, food was bland and waiter was OK he didn’t tend to us until I complained a little and didn’t have a manager come to us to ask us about our food and say hello like he did with other tables, I think he knew not to come maybe because he didn’t think we had money or didn’t look like those people. Very cruel and very judge mental of them probably won’t come back, funny thing is I was searching to see if this place would make it for my dinner party for my bday this year since I love it out in sf but we moved to SoCal and not they are crossed out and can’t wait to tell Ken about how horrible and terrible customer service they have here.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmapID>0x80c2bc083e0b1f21:0x76acc62a27588a38<//gmapID>< Rating>

<Text>This restaurant was recommended to my travel companions and I by someone who frequently visits LA. The hostess and service that greeted us seemed disappointed in our out-of-town status. They were a bit condescending and a little too pretentious for an establishment that seemed to have peaked 10 years ago. However, the food was very tasty and the server who waited on us was experienced and gave great recommendations for our meals. The garlic crab was excellent and the noodles are a must have to complement any meal.</Text>< pictures>

<resp>None</resp><Text>The service is terrible!!!!: glasses empty, fast ordering, and very fast turn over - they were setting up the table before we left!! What keeps them busy is their unique crab dish menu, otherwise it's average. But very poor service. Unless you have to eat crabs, stay away. Btw, money is not an issue, but this rest. is overpriced even for Beverly Hills. Nice, different decor.<//Text><Rate>1< /Rate><GmapID>0x80c2bc083e0b1f21:0x76acc62a27588a38< /GmapID>< user_id>

<user_name>Lillian Banchik< /user_name><Review>The food is excellent but it is vastly overpriced for what you get. This is especially true for parties over 8 people where they mandate a $168 per person minimum which is ridiculous. A high end appetizer with the most expensive main course on the menu (wagu steak) only cost $125 so they plan on making you heavily order from bar to make up the difference. We took my mother there for her 93rd birthday and since only one person there drank (a glass of wine) we needed to order 2 - 3 times more than we could eat and take the rest home to make the minimum.<//Review>< date>

The food is excellent, if quite expensive, perhaps too expensive for what it is. Last time there, our waitress was less than stellar.<//Text>

Beautiful restaurant but all the food on the menu was SO SALTY and now I feel I’m gonna have a heart attack jk but seriously what we had the garlic crab, garlic noodles and the mango salad were all salty. When ordering I suppose you can ask not to salt overdose on any of the items.<//Review>

You've got to be kidding. This place is a rip off - the food does not taste fresh or delicious, the garlic noodles are no big deal. The prawns were dry. The tiny kale salad (for $14) was so small and average in every way. I  was horribly disappointed - $180 later.I have no idea why some people think this place is good. A restaurant like Typhoon has it beat for miles!</text>

This resturant was amazing . The food was served hot, and the waiter was nice. I tried the garlic noodles and the crab puffs which both were delicious. The only downside was that the only reservation that was available was for 10pm, but the food made up for that.<//Text>

Must have - cocktail turmeric buck, it's so delicious the bartender and server both recommended it!! Only down side is the check. I think it's slightly overpriced...But then again, you're in Beverly Hills and these are BH prices! I think you can find comparable garlic noodles and  crab elsewhere for less.

The lobster mango salad used to be my favorite dish, however, not it is not what it once was. The front of the house has an arrogant attitude, and they do nothing to make it up to their patrons if they lag with your reservation, or if the food isn't what you ordered. The will try to stick you with the bill regardless of how much they drop the ball.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>It may no longer be considered sexy, but it's still a reliable crowd pleaser.  Crab and lobster are the obvious main draws here.  Secret kitchen recipes are a bit contrived, but you'll still be slurping up those garlic noodles and be asking for more.</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc083e0b1f21:0x76acc62a27588a38< /Gmap_id>< userid>

<Name>Food Shutterbug</Name><text>Had lunch at Crustacean with some friends. They don't take reservations via Open Table so I had to call them in (if you provide an email address they will send you a confirmation).

AMBIENCE: The restaurant's dark wood interior and ceiling fans lend a colonial vibe from days past and the see-through Koi fish walkway gave it a fengshui feel.  It is, however, very cramped in certain parts of the restaurant. Luckily we went for an early lunch on a weekday so it felt laidback.

SERVICE: The waiter knew his stuff and we followed his recommendations for an appetizer and dessert. As for the entree, there was no question that I was going to order the Roasted Crab and Garlic Noodles.

FOOD:  I'm allergic to MSG so I called the restaurant in advance to see if they use it like most Asian restaurants.  I had to make a few calls because the only way I could find out was to call when the Secret Kitchen cooking staff were in.  To my surprise, they don't use MSG at all!  The trade off is, however, some dishes were a bit too sweet such as the GARLIC ASPARAGUS (seasonal item that the waiter recommended) and the GARLIC NOODLES.  The seasoning on the famed ROASTED GARLIC CRAB was savory and provided a nice counterpoint to the sweet crab meat. Thanks to a tip from a blogger, I decided to pay an extra $5 to have the crab shelled in advance -- sometimes I'm a really clumsy eater and didn't want to risk having a crab leg fly onto my friends' laps.    I really enjoyed the meal, but if I were to go back, I would accompany my meal with either a dry white wine or Chinese tea to counterbalance the sweetness of most of the dishes.

PARKING:  Very difficult.  There's a 2 hour free parking lot nearby, but it's always full during peak times -- day or evening.  I ended up parking a block away at the metered parking garage at Camden near Santa Monica Blvd.

Very Americanized cuisine. For those looking for authentic or cutting edge food, this would probably rate less stars than what I've given here.< /text>< rate>

<Review>This place can be a bit stuffy but once you're seated the food is amazing. All the shellfish comes in a delicious butter-garlic sauce that you'll be craving for weeks. Also the koi pond in the floor is pretty nifty too.<//Review>< username>

Last night was my first time at crustaceans and the food was a bit over priced, the taste of the food was just ok. The greatest thing about this restaurant is the service, Shawn was my waiter and he was SIMPLY AMAZING!!! My friend brought her kid and before dinner was even at the table Miles was excited just to see Shawn pass our table, he accommodated us with little xtras and we definitely enjoyed our drinks. I don't believe I will be back for the food, but for the Lavender Mojito, maybe, it was delicious!<//review>

<Text>It's a bit pricey for what you get, but Crustacean is expensive so what are you gonna do...

Good beer specials though, and a very generous Happy Hour (almost the entire day!) and a warm friendly vibe.  LOTS of screens to watch your favorite sporting event, and free parking upstairs.</Text>< GmapID>

<review>Crab and noodles were good, but overpriced.  Very bland, just garlic and pepper tasting.

Tapas are basically hors d'oeuvres, don't get these... It's just a point or so above take-out Chinese appetizers.

It's not Vietnamese food, if you want that don't rely on the fact that the owners are Vietnamese.  The closest to Vietamese from (at least) my plates were the garnish.. Um but I ate the shredded cabbage.  The stuff you find in Thai/southeast Asian food</review>< Pics>

Way over priced . Even the garlic noodle, nothing to write home to (greasy and too soft). Crab ...what a waste of money ..cheaper and way tastier at any Chinese restaurant on Bolsa street in Little Saigon . Dessert really really bad. This place is catered more for non Asian who don't really know Asian or Viet-Chinese food. No reason to empty my pocket for so-so food when I can get so much better elswhere.</review>

Not happy with the way they handle reservations. I was told that it takes 72hrs to confirm a reservation, but no one answers the phone nor do they respond to your email reservation. I've been here many times the food was cold and not what I remember as far as quality.<//Review>

Crustacean lived up to my expectations. The garlic noodles were richly flavored al dente strands with buttery, garlicky goodness and so were the tiger prawns. The herb roasted halibut was tender and perfectly seasoned. If my dining companions and I had any complaints, we suppose the shrimp and mussels in the frutti di mare could have been larger and had a nicer bite similar to the tiger prawns. On our way out of the restaurant, we saw policemen and secret service attempting to escort a celebrity into the restaurant. Who was this mystery celebrity? Only TMZ will tell. Ah, the lives of foodies visiting the 90210 area code.<//Text>

seriously, who are these people in gowns and high heels in attendance? the food is actually really good though (don't miss the garlic noodles no matter what your doctor's told you about carbs) and you'll kick yourself for wanting to return to this obvious tourist trap in the heart of BH, but trust me it will happen to you too.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) crab. Anyway, salmon is the best.
Ask garlic pasta together
I did my best to put out the meat of salmon
Please mix and enjoy like oil soba.
I can not say anything, I feel happy.
However, everyone's cooking is silent (laughs)

(Original)
蟹。とにかく蟹が最高に美味しい。
ガーリックパスタを一緒に頼み
頑張って出した蟹の肉を
油そばのように混ぜてお召し上がりください。
何とも言えない、幸せな気分になります。
ただ、蟹料理は皆、無言になります(笑)</text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) First visit after renovation, to LAX seeking crustacean crabs. I ate garlic noodles and eat it, and I was moved by the delicious taste of stability ^ _ ^ However, the crab which was $ 60 two years ago has risen to $ 78 ,,,
You can also enjoy Napa's delicious wine in a glass.

(Original)
改装後に初訪問、crustaceanのカニを求めてLAXへ。ガーリックヌードルを絡めて食べて、安定の美味しさに感動^_^ただし、2年前は60ドルだったカニが78ドルに値上がりしてました、、、
Napaの美味しいワインもグラスで楽しめます。</Review>

(Translated by Google) The best crab is delicious!
My hands are oily, but I don't mind!
You should definitely eat!

(Translated by Google) It is a classic to eat garlic pasta with slimming (sauce is ◎).
All menus are beautiful and elegant.
Full dress is recommended.

(Original)
ガーリックパスタに蟹身(ソースが◎）をほぐして食べるのが定番。
全てのメニューが美しく上品な味です。
正装がおすすめです。</text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) I was disappointed because it was a modern interior. The previous Asian interior was great, but the second generation doesn't know the goodness of the original.
The taste has not changed, but the price has increased significantly. The bad customer service has not changed.
Shellfish are better with shells than with shells. It's best to concentrate on salmon and garlic noodles without relying on appetizers or salads. I do n’t need wine.

Revisited in September 2019
I miss the interior that seems to be an old Vietnamese dish. The interior is quite disappointing, and the artificial flower decoration is dirty. The staff wants to order food and wine, but it's better not to order anything except potatoes as they are not delicious. Raw spring rolls are particularly severe.
Valet parking is $ 16.

Postscript
The paper Epson with the second face written on it is severe. It looks like an APA hotel. You should manage from a customer's perspective rather than your own appeal. I want to say shame.

(Original)
なんだかモダンな内装になってしまい、がっかり。前のアジアンな内装が素晴らしかったのに、2代目はオリジナルの良さがわかっていない。
味は変わっていないが価格は大幅にアップ。接客の悪さは昔から変わらず。
蟹は殻から出した状態のものよりも、殻付きのほうが美味しい。ここではアペタイザーやサラダなどは頼まず、ひたすら蟹とガーリックヌードルに集中するのがベスト。気取ったワインもいりません。

2019年9月再訪
昔のベトナム料理らしいインテリアが懐かしい。今の内装はかなり残念、さらに造花の装飾が汚い。スタッフはやたら料理やワインを注文させたがりますが、蟹以外は美味しいとは言えないので注文しない方がいいです。特に生春巻は厳しいです。
バレーパーキングは16ドルです。

追記
2代目の顔が書かれた紙のエプソンは厳しい。まるでアパホテルのようだ。自分アピールよりも客目線で経営すべき。恥を知れと言いたい。</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIEiWEY3JrUfclnM067JD6KaPnwQsf37wv_mNZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<rate>5</rate><review>(Translated by Google) The renovation has made the atmosphere quite modern, but the taste of crab and garlic noodles hasn't changed. For some reason, there are only three types of beer, KOEDO. There is also a little glass of wine. I want to go again.

改装して雰囲気は随分西洋モダンになったが、カニとガーリックヌードルの美味さは変わらず。ビールは何故かKOEDOのみ3種類。グラスワインも少しある。また行きたい。< /review>< Pictures>
