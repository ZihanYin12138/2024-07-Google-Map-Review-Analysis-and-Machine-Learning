Good amount of parking in front and there's street parking if the lot fills up. My packages get scanned quickly. It has easy freeway access for quick in and out drop offs. I especially enjoyed the off-site drop off during the holidays. I loved that.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Saturday March 6th at 3:50 pm I have arrived at this location to drop off a package, I was face a very disrespectful Indian woman at the front desk. I would give her 0 star 🌟if I could because she was absolutely disappointing. I am hoping the USPS administration pay attention to this message and take her to administrative training and teach her to behave her self.< /Text>

<review>Where to begin? I have a po box, where mail is routinely delivered late. One time, a first class letter took FOUR (4) WEEKS to be delivered!

Hours when the front box area open are never predictable for those of us on a time schedule.

Wait times for a clerk are often at least half an hour when the line is longer than seven customers.  They and carriers  provide contradictory information often in broken English.

These are just the problems that are bugging me right at this moment..</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

Very unprofessional employees at this location. You can tell employees don’t care. Customers were told that this site was understaffed, which is why there are incredible long wait times for mail pick-up. As we are all feeling the effects from this unfortunate pandemic, however, it does not make it ok to treat people so rudely. There are so many people out of a job and they would give anything to be their shoes working. If you don’t like your job, then quit. No one is forcing you to work here.

I am currently at this facility now, they open at 10:00 and got here at 9:30 to ensure I was early. Mail pick-up door was not opened till 10:10. It is almost 11:00 and still have not seen anyone come back to the door and I was the first person in line.< /Text>

I don't even know where to start. We have been chasing around a package for a week. The carrier said he was unavailable to deliver to our place, yet somehow we have Amazon, UPS, FedEx delivering to our place without any trouble what so ever.
Their customer service is to send you home with a phone number that never answers. I have been twice at the office for the same issue and the same thing happens, they take my phone number and said they are going to call back and you guess it! The never call you back!. This is coming for a supervisor since I requested to talk to them. Very poor management, I have to give it one star because half wasn't available.< /Review>

<review>This is the WORST post office. The wait times are terrible, employees don't know what they are doing, nobody answers the phone lines, calls are not made back when promised. I have been trying to get a key to a new mailbox and have gotten the run around for 4 months. I put a written request in (with a supervisor) for a new lock which they said would take about 5 days and they'd call me when ready- it's been 15 and still no call. HORRIBLE customer service.</review>< pics>

This post office needs to hire more people and be considerate of people's time. Shut this place down or hire more people and get some air conditioning. There are people actually depending on their mail and to have such horrible service something needs to be done about this. Get some radios, some phone lines or exchange numbers amongst each other so we can be better served at this post office.

Thanks,

your friendly community of YOUR area.<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>My experience was from 1:30pm-4:30pm on a Friday.  This place is a joke.  Insufficient parking in lot.  Only 30 minute parking on the street.  I enjoyed a three hour wait.  30 minutes of which I spent in the USPS line which was packed and was only be attended to by one USPS employee.  Just FYI, the Passport office is on the north side of the building past the USPS counter from the parking lot.  There are signs on the Northern side of the building directing you but I didn't notice any walking in from the parking lot.  There is no public bathroom.  Eventually I left and went down the street to REI to use their bathroom.  At least they use a ticket system so I didn't loose my place in line.  They're horribly understaffed.  All the employees have signs on their desks asking you not to talk to them while they're with customers and directing people to the travel.state.gov website.  There's no one to answer questions so individuals do come up to talk to them and are told to wait.  Eventually the employee who had been the only one servicing the USPS counter came and helped with Passports.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3WPhgo9_NqDBHybAkVVrLhEr1N90yYfWYt3rL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyY5vMuBnLg7brrQ84iR3p2FJjrn0cdDr1DyLV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPR7TLaq8vLDQJ39Nan0TaIQYHlPcV3BPlbdWq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809ad755d43ea705:0x7bd455ad0bd444ee< /gmap_id></record>

I went to pick up a held package.  People had been waiting for over two hours while the agent was "looking for packages"  I waited twenty minutes without anyone returning.  Really? That disorganized?  And they wonder why UPS and FedEx are running circles around them?  Barely functional, what a shame or more accurately sham.   Congress needs to make a stand on reorganization of this national service.</Text>

The lady working had a c-collar  on. Asked the guy if his box was heavy, saying she only had use of one arm. The box wasn’t that big. With an attitude was asking the guy about his  package.  Was quite rude if you ask me. Then it was my turn, when I got to the desk, I asked for a priority box to put my paperwork in (because the stock out in lobby was empty. I was given box and told to go back to the end of the line, and fill out a label because others were waiting too.  I handed the lady instantly a label I already had filled out, telling her she and they could wait till I folded the box, because it wasn’t my fault they had no boxes ready for me.  I was not going to go back in a 20min wait line.  The post office needs to staff with people who can actually do the work and ones without attitudes.  Also, pickup door outside had a line of like 9 people, and no one helping them..< /Text><Name>Second Wind Resort< /Name><Rating>1</Rating><gmap_id>0x809ad755d43ea705:0x7bd455ad0bd444ee<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place needs to train its employees on customer service and how to answer a phone. I needed a package held at the post office because it required a signature and no one was going to be home. I was told no problem and it would be held. When I called the post office all day on Saturday no one picked up! It was supposed to be there Saturday and I got nothing! Finally on Monday after calling for 3 hours I had to call from a different number to even reach someone. The lady that answered was SO RUDE! And she said it went out for delivery when it wasnt supposed to leave the post office!!!! She told me she would call me back and I still haven't heard anything from them!

To top it off it said my package got delivered and signed for. I'm pretty sure the mail main signed it ILLEGALLY and delivered it in my mail box. I have never been so mad at someone in customer service and I'm a calm person from working in customer service for years.

A week ago I had to pick up a package and waited 45 minutes and was told maybe someone will help you! I hate this post office and I hope I dont have to go back!</Review>

Not sure why this branch even has a phone. They have never bothered to pick it up when I have tried to call....EVER!!!  Probably one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. What cracks me up is when you call the federal Post Office, they can't wait to have you take a customer satisfaction survey after you have spoken to an agent. The problem is the wait time to speak to an agent is between an hour and an hour and a 1/2. Absolutely ridiculous...what a joke!<//Text>

My daughter and I were at the Royal Oaks Post office, trying get a money order and mail out an application for renewing her passport.  I was at the main counter and I had few questions regarding the application. I wanted to make sure we do everything correct before closing the envelope. I asked the clerk, her name was Kiran where I put the pics on the application.  She was so rude and disrespectful, she’s replied,  are you not wearing your glasses that you can not see?????? My daughter was so upset with her, I am disabled and have many issues, including vision and memory problems.  She was so rude I will file a complaint with Consumer Affairs!!! If she can’t handle her job she shouldn’t be there! She had a strong accent on top of that, could barely understand what she’s saying!  I will never go back to that location again!   Will further file  a complaint, make sure this matter gets followed up on.  Kiran has a Disgusting attitude!!!!!< /text>

I'm frustrated! I'm trying to call you 3rd day in the row and you are not picking up the phone! I tried 3 different numbers. I'm literally calling all day, every few minutes. I have an emergency, you are holding my package, that supposed to be returned long time ago. I'm loosing my customers. Even employees from different post office from Sacramento are surprised that you are still holding my package! What should I do to contact you, I leave to far to go there by myself!< /Text>

Our daughter 12 went on camping to Barney Falls with her friend's family this month and sent a post card to her grand parents in Japan. She took a long time to write in Japanese and English and draw a cute  picture of her doing some activity at the camp site. She came home and we found out that she  put a stamp to the US without knowing..that's not enough for international. My friend told me how hard she tried to write this card but we were sad to find out that the post card probably won't be going anywhere. Today, we got a phone call from her grandpa saying they received her postcard!! They were very happy to receive a special post card from her. We talked on face time and he showed me the card. There was a stamp shows insufficient stamp but they still delivered it to Japan. We were so touched. This post card was mailed out from Sacrament post office. We appreciate their kind heart. We would like to say thank you to them!!</Review>

<Review>really rude employees! Do you like when people answer you like you're stupid? How about when they roll their eyes at you? Then boy, this is the place for you! Come on down and you won't ever have to worry about receiving good customer service. I love when people frown at me and make me feel like I'm wasting their time. Why be polite and friendly, when you can make it obvious that you hate your job? 0/10 will definitely come back when I'm ready for another example of how not to work customer service.<//Review>< pics>

It's unfortunate for me that this is the post office that my packages go to to be held, and it's unfortunate that this is the post office that sends my packages out for delivery at the apartment complex I live at. Apparently, the way they deliver packages to the apartment complex is writing down the list of packages they are "supposed" to deliver, and then dropping off any packages in the truck. They don't check to ensure that all of the packages they say they are dropping off are actually there. I went to ask if they could check somehow, and they said that it's the leasing office of the apartment complex's fault for not checking the delivery.

They kept telling me to go to the leasing office. The leasing office doesn't have it, even though the post office claims that they do. When the woman behind the counter pretended to check for my package in the back, she kept repeating the wrong number. I had to say the actual number over and over, but she was not really looking (I said it was a package and she kept looking at flat envelopes).

Honestly, if I were to have the same worth ethic as the employees of this post office, I would have been fired many times over. I don't understand why they make the post office experience worse than getting a root canal.<//Review>< pictures>

Anyway, I  went to receive package after the date & package has been missing every since.  We have gone in & called but gotten nothing  but the run around.  We have been promised a return call but it has been over 2 weeks & no call.  I don't think the package was misplaced but stolen considering the contents inside & the inability to get insurance on the items.  It is sad & a terrible  feeling when one can't even trust where your mail is delivered. SMH😔😔<//review>< Pics>

A very busy place, especially at their later closing time!
The staff was very pleasant and helpful, even the branch manager, Mitch, assisting customers in the lines .... helping to make things move as smoothly and quickly as possible. It was impressive to me how a positive atmosphere was maintained through a very hectic situation. Other branches would do well to emulate them . . .<//text>

Want to get in and out fast for passport? Just prepare EVERYTHING (form, copies of every paperwork, photos) at home to save time and money and come super early :) and i mean super early like before they even open because there will be a line. Got there at 10:00 am, open at 10:30 am. I'm the 5th person in the line and the process of waiting + everything is 2 hours got out at 12:00 pm...Not so bad.<//review>

<Text>Most terrible  office I ever seen in my life. My mail always lost, but I got somebody's  mail frequently. Manager doesn't  care at all. He just blame me and senders. Online it is shows that package came to the office and then was delivered  but manager continue to prove that package was lost before it came to their office.They send my driver license  back to DMV twice. Unfortunately  can not sell house to change post office, so continue  to pray for manager to get  transfered somewhere  else. Always wondering  how such unprofessional people got their  jobs.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The line is nothing to play with. I suggest you get there as early as possible. I got there 15 minutes before opening and only made it to the waiting list. The two women Janet and Merlita did a great job with getting people in and out. The wait is worse than the DMV but they did a great job being just the two of them. I was able to get my passport done although I was on the no guarantee list. I am very happy!<//Review>

They should place on the interenet that they don't take anymore applications after certain hour so people don't drive there.

I am posting negatively about a business for the first time ever. If I ever take the time to post it is usually for great customer service, or satisfaction.

Today I showed up at the royal oaks post office to have my passport reinstated. The time states that you can do this up until 6:30 in the post office, office. Mind you I understand I need to be there before that to actually get it taken care of. I got there at 6:15, and the doors were locked. There was an Asian man, not calling him a gentleman, behind the desk, right by the closed doors. I tried to open them three times and he didn't look up. I politely knocked, and no look. I decided to try to open the doors harder, maybe I was just mistaken by how the door opens? Nope, they were locked and the Asian man finally decided to glance up for two seconds to give me a disgusted look and point to the other double doors on the side of the building. He must've thought I was there to drop off mail.  I figured maybe as it nears closing time they only have those doors open. I go to the other doors and they are locked as well, but now he's far enough away to where him ignoring me does not seem unreasonable. I took advantage of the mail delivery window with the doorbell next to me, and used that to finally have an employee there speak with me. They started by abruptly saying it closes at 6 (I was now in the area of the post office that does), and the time was now around 6:18-6:20. I said I was there for my passport and that the office was closed and he was not paying attention to me. They fired back saying it takes about 20 minutes so they wouldn't be able to help. I was frustrated, so I do admit I snapped a bit and said that I was in the correct spot earlier but he didn't open the door or pay me any notice. Their last excuse was that he was having a bad day?! I ended up exclaiming that I just did not want my time to be wasted at this point and would appreciate them telling me if I at least have the correct paper work and documentation so that I could come back and take care of it. As this happened, i saw the Asian man walk back to the office to pretty much hide, I asked if i could talk to him about that to be sure, and the lady said she could help me as she does passports too. They did help with that, and I am forced to go back there to have it taken care of, but I have never been treated so rudely, and basically ignored to my face, because that person was having a "bad day" and did not want to work til the end of their shift?

Point of this post, if you can avoid royal oaks post office, do so. If you will be needing a person to person engagement, you will be taking the 50/50 chance that they are having a good or bad day, and that will determine the respect with which you receive. NOT WORTH IT!< /Review>

Submitted an on-line mail forwarding from Sacramento, CA 95815 to Carmichael, CA 95608 on 10/1/13 for period 10/3/13 to 11/7/13, no forwarded mail is being received.  After 14 days I contacted the Royal Oaks Post Office on three separate days.  I was told it would be taken care of and I  asked to be called back for confirmation and they agreed to do so.  As of this date (10/18/13) the forwarding has not been completed and no one returned a call to explain.  I am now on hold waiting (30minutes) to discuss with supervisor.   This is not the first time I have had difficulty getting this post office to complete requested actions.  A postal manager need to see what the issues are at this location.
Update 10/19/13, setting record straight... fault was at the Carmichael, CA post office NOT Royal Oaks, a sub postal employee did not handle the transfer correctly, finally receive mail today 16 days after requested forwarding.  Postal supervisor at Carmichael was helpful and followed up to get the mail in our hands, good job by Patrick, appreciate his efforts.<//review>

Phone line always busy. They never answer.  Why bother calling.  Why they even have a phone number for. They have not resolved my issue, not receiving mail.  It's my third time calling about this problem. The worst post office in the United States. Call any other post office and they answer within the first or second call.</review>

Very poor service for passport. They should change the people working there. We can see that they are on purpose working slow. People are sitting and the people working there are talking and gossiping. And always they put a sign out there at 3:30 that no more applications today. Even if there are not too many people in there. They do it everyday same like that. That’s very wrong. Also they skip the token numbers and when someone ask them that there number did not came on the board and they took the number ahead of that person, people working here just make and excuse that they did it by mistake.
Government should definitely do something about this issue. People working in this department are getting salary for sitting there and gossiping.
This is very wrong and people of America are suffering due to this.</Review>

Its silly to expect mistakes to never happen. Ontop of that, USPS does a great job! Whenever they successfully deliver a package, that person doesn't leave a positive review, otherwise there would be 1,000,000 positive reviews online about USPS. It's only when they lose your package that people place reviews.<//review><gmap_id>0x809ad755d43ea705:0x7bd455ad0bd444ee<//gmap_id>< resp>

Literally the most unprofessional and worst post office ever, and that’s saying something... rude staff, returned twice to get a passport only to be turned away each time ‘for reasons beyond our control’. Save yourself the time and avoid this place.< /text>

I went to apply for a passport only to find that they will simply stop serving customers if the line is too long. I was there 1.5 hours before their scheduled close time and was turned away. There is no way of knowing when they will stop serving customers,  so I suppose you just have to arrive when they open if your schedule permits, which mine does not. When I complained to the worker, she rudely suggested that I go wait in another line to talk to a supervisor. Are you kidding me??
As an alternative, I tried scheduling an appointment at another post office and the phone number takes you to a voicemail where they ask you to leave a number and they'll get back to you to schedule the appointment. The problem is that they never get back to you.
There is no way a private company could stay in business if they offered such poor service. The post office should be privatized, as it would be doing the public a favor.<//review>

<Review>I came here on a Tuesday morning. Parking lot holds about 20 cars. 2 hour street parking. Mind you, limited parking for both doing business at the post office and passport office. Signs infront of the post office directs you towards the side towards the passport office. No public restrooms. Hours are actually 1030 - 1830 Mon - Sat. They do a ticket system. Plenty of chairs. All relevant infomation is on a table to the left as you enter. Employees seem too busy to help you personally. Waited from 1020, finished by 1130. I was number 4 in line. I saw 10 people waiting as I was leaving. Two employees for the whole 8 hours. I'd imagine fatigue and irritability gets to them as the day goes on. The guy seemed hating life. The gal was pleasant enough. Had everything ready: DS-11, birth certificate, ID. They photocopy your documents for you. They take your picture for an extra $15, and actually give you the extra headshot. They take cash, check, and debit. They only do DS-11 for passport applications. The actual process takes 10 minutes. The extra 30 - 60 minutes comes from waiting in line. I'd imagine everything becomes hell later in the day, but I can only give my impression from 1030 - 1130: not a terrible experience if you're there before lunch.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEss_1WzC7UBIn4PcZbUDPp9_no6zBmSpBsvW6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

They changed our mailbox without informing us, they don't bother to ring our door to deliver the new key or mail.  Old key no longer works, and mail is sitting in the box without access.  W2/Checks being held up by USPS is messing with our livelihood, they could care less.  Without money, no food.  I hope this mail carrier starves for a few days</review>

<review>If I could give this post office 0 stars, I would. USPS lost my package. The tracking number said it was delivered to the parcel locker to the mail box near my house. I never received the key to the parcel locker so I went to this post office to request the key. I went there 4 times in 2 weeks for help. No one cared to help me. I had 2 supervisors tell me they would call me to follow up, they never did. I had to wait in my car for 2 and a half hours for the mail man to open up the parcel lockers to get a freaking answer. USPS lost my package that I waited 2 weeks to see what the hell happened to it. If you can't get access to your parcel or it says its delivered and you didnt get it. File a claim. Don't even bother wasting your time on anyone at this post office. They will only say what you want to hear and not do anything about it. This is the worst post office ever.<//review>< pictures>

<review>Currently leaving the office without a receipt! The lady Janet was rude and impatient as if she didn't know that people would like to obtain passports for their kids she tried maybe like 3times to get my son's picture then said we would have to get it somewhere else. Out of those trys she had one good shot and missed it so it was not entirely my son's fault! I asked if she had a survey I can fill out and she answered with its on your receipt I told her I didn't have one because we didn't go through the prosses. She pointed out the door and said there's supervisors out there if you want to complain.  She was rude from the start. I'm a very positive and friendly person but this lady just ticked me off, off of how rude she was.< /review>< Pics>

DWB.  Driving while brown or dumb white bi***.  Yup that old lady seems pretty darn racist.  That or she really hates to see interracial couples since my brother came in with his girlfriend.  She wouldn't take my credit card because my license signature didn't completely match the signature I put on the pad.  Obviously, my ID name matches my credit card!  Why would we use a stolen credit card to send a $5 package?  Also that old white man threw my change into my hands when I paid cash.  Wow!<//Review>

<text>Absolutely horrific! Their customer service gets the lowest rating possible! They are rude and completely unwilling to be helpful. A package was sent to this location from amazon that I needed as soon as possible. I paid for express shipping. it was sent to this location and never sent out to be delivered. I called the next day and was told it was there and could be picked up. I went to pick up the package and the rude girl in the window told me they did not have it. I asked to speak to a supervisor who told me she called a different location and my package was there. I thanked her and went to the other location. When I got there, they told me they did not have it and it was at the original location I was at. I called customer service to get an answer and was sent back to Royal Oaks. The people at the front counter still said they did not know and were rude and unwilling to help. I am unbelievably upset with this horrible service. None of those people deserve to be working there.<//text>< Pics>

A package I had wasn't shipped to me and was for some reason "forwarded" even though my correct address was given. When I emailed asking about where my package was, Shane Anderson, Supervisor of Customer service, wrote to me, " unfortunately, your carrier forwarded this parcel in error.  It should be arriving back at the Royal Oaks Post Office for delivery soon."  When I called this post office, nobody even answered. GREAT SERVICE!!! My package is still missing.<//Review>

<Review>Came there with my daughter for her passport at 12:30pm. Was told by People already there to expect a 4 hour wait. One employee, the slowest I've ever seen in my life! Reminded me of the sloth in zootopia. Nice guy, but moves sloooowwww!!! They close at 6:30pm, but at 3(!!) there were 3 people left in line (including me) and he already told new comers that he "may be able to SQUEEZE them in". Still, probably your best shot of getting a passport around Sacramento... good luck!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This review comes with the knowledge that most government-ran facilities are a joke, especially DMV. I had EVERYTHING ready; my completed DS-11, photo, birth certificate AND a copy, ID AND a copy. It literally took me 39 mins from the time I stepped in to the time I stepped out. That not bad at all, however, this was 11am on a Friday morning. So pick your time wisely. I was #24 just 30 minutes after they opened. I hope I I have provided some useful information.<//Review>

The management of this USPS site is not good at all, specially the lady whom is the manager, she is very rude to all people she accused a person of stealing a tape but the person showed her his used tape which had the sold stump on it which means he paid for it. I always use USPS for almost all of my mailing and shipping, but this kind of behavior makes people unhappy and dissatisfied, I wrote this comment to let the top management to know about the poor performance of this site manager.<//text>

I walked up both doors open at 5:57 pm 2 people in Line & she yells where CLOSED! So I go to passport office which closes at 6:30, there’s 1 last filling out application not to mention my app is filled out & the old man at the first desk says where closed cause I'm by myself. All I could do was say ok & smh cause I know for sure it only takes 13 minutes to a passport. This office needs a course on customer service!</text>

Had a package stuck in "missent/rerouting" hell for a week as it made circles between two post offices. Called the USPS, they said they'd investigate and get back to me.

2 days later, "Sammy" from the Royal Oaks Post Office calls to give me some news. Tells me to call him back - I call the number (the same one listed for this post office) and it rings, and rings, and rings ... 75 rings later, the phone company cuts off the call, as they do. No answering machine, no answer, nothing.

Then I try the two other numbers I can find for this same post office (one is the number caller ID lists the call came from). Same thing.

Finally, on my fifth call to the first number, someone picks up after 32 rings. And then promptly says "goddamn" and hangs up the phone on me before I can say anything.

They call me back the next day again, and rudely tell me "you were really hard to get ahold of." Really? Try answering your phone.

Not a friendly office - and they're not fulfilling their responsibilities to the parent organization, who now after my letter to the USPS OIG has to investigate why a staffer is giving out a number that they have no interest in answering.

I am a big fan of the USPS, but the staff of this post office give that organization a bad name.< /text>

Arrive to ship packages and their lobby is closed from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm due to past vandalism.  Seriously?  How about hiring a security guard during business hours if it is that bad?  Instead, they penalize the entire community during holiday season by closing their doors.   Ridiculous.<//text>

Do not go to this post office to get your passport done, or you will be there for long  time. This place only has 3 employees that handle the paper work and it takes for ever. This place does not even have a bathroom so you have to walk down to the gas station. This is ridiculous worst place ever.</Review>

I'm not the most patient person in the world, but I try my best especially when I'm in places like this, but is ridiculous that they don't have bathrooms, considering the amount of people that come to this place, in which more than 50% are kids.<//Review>

If their was a 0 rating star I would put zero this place is no good especially when it’s your first time getting a passport book the workers are rude and have no patience like why do they even work their if they don’t like it .. a man just stops when he wants to then comes back when he wants to and theirs a whole bunch of people waiting and mind you theirs only 2 workers in the passport office and the place moves slow< /review>

Mid afternoon Wednesday, tried to call three times in a row. No answer. After it rings for several times, I'm disconnected. Yeah, overall I don't think they get enough credit for the good stuff they do, but why have a phone number if no one will answer it</Text>

<Review>Went to The Chocolate Bar for the firt time, I fell in love with it, music was soothing,  took me back to when I was a child in my grandparents house. Ordered a few items and everything was delicious,  brownie wasn't too sweet, chocolate abuelita was just right. Will definitely be going back to try out more!!! Thank you for your kind service, great personality!! Very welcoming !!</Review>< Pics>

<text>Wide variety of treats and snacks.  I tried the cheesecake and was kicking myself after I ordered for not getting a topping for it.  Honestly the cheesecake is so good it doesn't need a topping.

Definitely will visit again when I'm in the area.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDoaYmYUBZWA15sJvhnELfS3XASSCzFw6wKl33=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>{'time': 1616523570291, 'text': 'Thank you Dieter for your support!

Extremely delicious!!!!! 🤤🤤🤤
It’s a little pricey but it’s completely worth it...
we got the chocolate cake,
Chocolate gelato,
Mango gelato,
And chocolate chip cookies...
this place is perfect for desserts,
Extremely clean, customer service is on point... the guy there was extremely nice to my son... 😊
The best part are the chocolate chip cookies, they’re big, recently baked, the chocolate completely melts on your mouth.
5 out of 5 star service... ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
Will be going back again,
Favorite new spot for dessert... 🍪🍫<//Text>

There is bound to be a treat for you.  The chocolate comes in numerous styles.  My friends and I couldn't decide, so we were offered samples of not only the treats, but the ice cream that accompanied them.  I believe we made the right combination.  There is also  "café de hoya," which will make any Mexican customer feel right at home.< /Text>

This was our second visit and it was just as good as the first. We each had a martini and decided the Chocolate Covered Pretzel is the best! We had lunch, half sandwich and French onion soup (so good), and finished with a free dessert of warm chocolate in a martini glass with fresh strawberries to dip (from a free birthday dessert offer they sent me in a text). Honestly, this place is worth the visit. Great service, delicious food, and a great theme of chocolate throughout.</Text>

This place is incredible! We loved the coffee and the authentic Mexican hot chocolate and the mouth watering desserts! The ambiance was very comforting too and the beautiful Spanish music being played took me back home to some very nice memories! The nice couple that tended to us made us feel like we were special guests in their home! Can't wait to go back again over and over!!!</Text>

<Review>This place instantly warmed me up once I stepped inside. The aroma of the fresh cafe de olla brings me back to my childhood in mexico, spending time in mi Abuela's kitchen. The cafe is PERFECTLY made (it's rare for me to not add anything to my coffee). Their pastries are as delicious as they look. The crepes recipe is on point! Plus they have their candies packaged for purchase! The family running this cafe is doing great things with their business and I thank them for the great foods with even greater service 🤗
The mood this Chocolate Bar sets makes it comfortable for casual brunches, friends and family, cute dates and even when you're by yourself 🙋🏽
Please take the time to visit El Bar de Chocolaté 🍫 your life may just get a little sweeter!</Review>< Pictures>

Family owned, amazing service, delicious cafe de olla and one perfect crepe! The menu has just about any craving you could have and the cafe de olla is the real thing. Pasteries, cookies, mousses, nuts, gelato, coffee, hot chocolate, you name it. Perfect to stop in for a treat or adorable place to sit down and enjoy with someone.< /Text>

Owner is very hospitable. We tried their gelatos which were delicious. They’re Cafe de Holla was amazing! It’s dark sweet cinnamon coffee, with no cream or milk, and it doesn’t need it because it is so yummy! I’d prefer to go here than my delight cupcakes across the shopping center. There’s plenty of seating areas to enjoy a delicious crepé. The music gave us a very relaxing vibe.< /Review>

<text>This is place is great. They have delicious Italian desserts  and a nice variety to choose from. The desserts are a bit pricey, and the place can use more lighting.But they are new and tucked in the shopping mall, so if you're interest you should go and try it to help the business out and try their amazing choices.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1576894531186, 'text': 'Jose, wow!

< review>
Owner was really awesome, very nice. They just opened and didn't have a lot of customers when I walked in. He gave me a cupcake while I waited for my coffee (which was only $2.95 btw) then after I payed handed me 3 scoops of sorbet! It was all really good, and I'm headed back even if they don't give anything away next time< /review>

Tried the strawberry short cake(I think) and the mango gelato and it was very delicious! Very spacious place and different seating styles, MUST VISIT.</Review>< Pics>

There is bound to be a treat for you.  The chocolate comes in numerous styles.  My friends and I couldn't decide, so we were offered samples of not only the treats, but the ice cream that accompanied them.  I believe we made the right combination.  There is also  "café de hoya," which will make any Mexican customer feel right at home. I came with my friend looking for tiramisu, ended up with a torta, 2 delicious crepes, 4 tiramisu,macaroon and some asorteas nuts. The torta was fresh, amazing, and plated beautifully. The crepes were made fresh to order and delicious. The macaroons were soft and fresh. This place is a must go-to for sure. everything is delicious and fresh. 100% recommend</review>

Only 1 stylist cutting hair left after waiting for 25 min.  It seems the other stylist was meeting with the owner,should've met before opening or had someone else cutting hair. Poor scheduling.</review>

< Review>
Decent place for a haircut, the haircut I got was okayish. Some hairs had to be cut at home because they were significantly longer than the rest, (around the ears).. Price is kind of high for the work they did. The rest of the hair looked pretty good but for the money I'd go somewhere else.< /Review>

I cannot remember the name of the girl that cut my hair, but she did a very good job, was really friendly, and fun to chat with. I typically try to avoid chain barber shops, but I think this will be my new go-to place to get my haircut. Thanks again!<//Review>

<Review>A decent place to get basic hair cuts. I've gotten my hair cut from multiple people here and they all have turned out pretty good so far. My most recent one was from April and she did a great job! Very educational hair cut as well. :)< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1522760925489, 'text': 'We appreciate you being our customer, Chris!

My daughter had her hair layered but the girl didn't layer the back. I didn't notice till we were home. I'm guessing the hairdresser was unexperienced. I'm sure she would of fixed it if we had noticed in time.< /Text>

<text>Bad haircuts. Never see the same person twice. Stylists leave ASAP. IndistIbyou give them your phone number to "check in". Employees wrote derogatory comments about clients and treat you accordingly. Woman cut my hair SO FAST it was like she was in race. Haircut was a joke. Uneven sideburns, uneven and asymmetrical. Plus they purposely leave either the sides or back longer so you come back sooner.  NEVER GO BACK. Go ANYWHERE ELSE!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I usually give a 2 star ratting and mention one positive thing. I have been to this location several times as it is near my house and they do a decent cut for a fair price. This last time I went was the worst experience I have ever had at a retail or service establishment. I have never felt so disrespected or demeaned by an individual as this lady maybe me feel. If there is a hand book on how to deal with a customer misunderstanding she did the exact opposite of that. She yelled at me, she got in my face, she interrupted me at least 9 times and to top it off she snapped her figures at me, to get my attention, like you would with a dog! This lady made no attempt to listen to my side or or do anything other than justify her position. I told them that if I left with this unresolved I would NEVER visit this location or company for the rest of my life. I left and till the day I die I will never visit another great clips. If you choose to go here I wish you better luck than I had.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1519163311352, 'text': "We're sorry this was your experience, Soren.

The person that gave me my haircut started out by stating it was their last day and then proceeded to give me the worst haircut I’ve ever gotten.
My haircut is uneven. My neck is still scratched two hours later from the clippers they used, and while distracted the person accidentally started to cut my hair without the clipper guard on so I have a shaved line on the back of my head.
Worst haircut I have ever gotten.<//Text>

Regina is the "Manager" or owner. If she's not she works it like it is her baby... I always wait for her i don't care  even if i mobile checked I'll wait the extra for her. the rest of the staff is friendly. Service is quick especially if you utilize their mobile check in app. I always leave a few pounds lighter... little barber humor... no seriously though... Great place for a single person or getting the whole fam done...< /Text>

<text>Horrible job! Someone needs to reconsider who they hire. DO NOT RECOMMEND GOING! I feel so embarrassed of how they left my hair. I have to wear my hair up because is ridiculous how they did my "face framing". The sides of my hair are cut unevenly, it makes it look as if i were emo.There is a BIG CHUNK of hair cut on my right side of face meanwhile on my left it is barely touched. I'm very frustrated and let down. I'm warning you right now, don't ever come here ! I'm saving you your time, money, and upsetting tears. If you decide to go, go at your own risk.... I'm NEVERRRR coming back here again. I truly hope nobody has to go through this terrible experience like i did.</text></record>

<Review>The haircut I received was the worst I've had in years.  The stylist's primary razor needed sharpening -- it was pulling my hair as it cut.  When she trimmed my neckline with her compact razor, she scraped up my neck -- it took a few days for it to heal.  To top it off, I had to trim excess longs hairs around both of my ears when I got home.</Review>< pics>

Great clips has always been a hit or miss. Depending on who is working. Some people care and listen, while others cut your hair in a way you don't like, but don't want to be rude to confront. Its like wouldn't the person want to build a reputation. Cutting hair isn't just a job. You are creating a new feeling for someone. Try and get it right. Thank you for the ones that have listened.</text>

Came in here to get a hair cut since I was staying in a hotel down the street. Walked in there was no one in there Michelle took me and cut my hair. I asked for a zero sides and 3 on top with a high fade. High and tight. She told me how she could cut hair under the influence and it's easy. I have not had anyone cut my hair in over 15 year. I always cut my hair myself. Boy did she mess me up. Scratched up my neck. The fade was all messed up and uneven. One side was rounded on side was boxed. I would not recommend her to anyone. They do offer a veterans discount but the cut should have been free. It was bad.</text>

This just isn’t funny anymore. Horriable absolutely horriable. Every time I get my hair cut I tell the person their getting a 10 dollar tip just to make sure they do a good job. That’s $25 for a simple 4-2-0 fade. 3 TIMES. I gave them a chance the second time I had to go back 2 times. IM NOT PICKY, I have simple hair. Today she completely bombed neck line to the point it’s not fixable. The left side fade is way higher than the other side. I left thinking it was ok but I’m wrong yet again. SHE WAS BRAGGING ABOUT HOW SHE LOVES CUTTING HAIR. You should stop. 3 times 3 different people. They ALL SUCK. Btw she took the Initiative and messed up my beard also</text>

There may be only one lady able to cut men's hair. Most are cosmologists without a barber's license. They don't know that the clippers are supposed to go up and down, instead they cut front to back causing a feathered and patchy fade. The lengths will be uneven from left to right.< /Review>

Today I had a 2 hour massage by Angel! I have missed his hands! He’s always professional and does an amazing job! Really sad he’s leaving! I will have to find another therapist who is just as good! I hope the county doesn’t go back into the purple so I can keep getting my massages!</text>

When I walk in to see if they have an available time, the receptionist is literally on the phone booking an appointment, but feels the need to remove her face mask and whisper, sorry we are closed. It wasn't even 7pm. Mind you, the door was unlocked and all the lights were on and, again, she was literally booking an appointment.  I'm guessing the issue was me?  Idk.  Completely unprofessional and makes zero sense.</Text>< rating>

This place had to close during the pandemic which is understandable and during that time they continued to take my monthly membership payment. I tried to call them to see if it could be paused but the phone only had a voice recording that you can’t leave a message on and there’s no other way, that I was able to find, to contact them. My only option would be to report it as fraud to my bank, so I continued to pay it. Once they opened I Attempted to make an appointment, unfortunately they are booked for the next 2 weekends. My issue lies in the lack of communication. When they reopened they should have instantly started calling monthly memberships that kept them afloat while closed and offered those people first dibs on appointments. Instead I was left to repeatedly call to see if they were open or not and when I get lucky and find that they are indeed open they aren’t available any time in the near future. You should cater to those that paid you even when you were closed.</text>

<review>I love this place! I’m always treated with courtesy and I feel relaxed every time I walk in there. Very clean place and they are very professional. I don’t even have a specific massage therapist because everyone they have given me has been great. Highly recommend

I have a new favorite therapist, her name is MINA, shes new and definitely going to be my go to everytime!<//review>< pics>

These negative reviews dont deter me. I see the negativity as simply the competition trying to smear this company. ESPECIALLY the ones posted by reviewers with10 and fewer reviews.

I purchased gift cards and was greeted with nothing but professionalism. I saw 3-4 customers enter during my transaction and all appeared to be pleased.

I'm planning to use their services myself as well. More than happy to update you with my experience.<//text>

This place is terrible.  We were members for 5+ years with no issues.  Now, the appointment staff is rude and un-accommodating.  We have not been able to use our services as often as we would like and they tend to role over.  Now the math is not adding up and services we have paid for are missing. We have been promised an accounting of when these appointments were used, but receive nothing and not even a "we will look in to it" from the counter staff.  In my eyes this boils down to stealing, and they couldn't care less.  I recommend everyone steer clear.  Spend the extra $5 for massage envy.< /Text>

Very unprofessional when it comes to purchasing or setting up appointments. Who ever set up my appointment mis lead me with services provided. Receptionists were unaware of appointment and what the appointment entailed.  They made it extremely difficult to redeem a Groupon. They need to better train their staff. I will not return here.< /Review>

<Text>This was my first time ever using a laundry mat and I'm so glad my first experience was at Lavadero Coin Laundry! I was greeted as soon as I walked in by Ariselle. She helped me pick out a washer that worked with a Visa card, helped me get change for the dryer, and showed me how to use the machines. She offered me the WiFi password and helped hand sanitizer!

The whole place was bright, clean, and felt safe and comfortable.<//Text>< Resp>

<review>We have been doing laundry here for months and find it to always be clean and in good repair. The attendant is always nice and welcomes us. They have free complimentary WIFI, while you wait.  Low on cash? You can use your credit or debit card to pay for most washers.<//review>< Pictures>

Check You Credit Card Charges:
Decent place to wash... machines are usually clean and available unless it's rush hour.

Problem is that the machines will charge you more if you use credit card. I used $3.50 machine, it declined my first card but charged me $5 anyway without me knowing. i tried a second card and it worked but it also charge me $5 instead of the $3.50.

Use cash if you come here, it's a hassle trying to get this sort it out they think you are scamming then even though you show then the credit card texts showing the charges.< /Review>

<Review>The laundry mat employees are typical two friendly ladies that will help you with any of the machines, if you need it. There is also a restroom located inside the building but you will need to have a quarter and an employee to let you in.

Washers and Dryers work great, and they have a variety of sizes for both uses. If you don't have or happen to forget soap/dryer sheets/fabric softener, don't worry, they have a vending machine inside that sells them all at your convenience. There is also a little mini arcade area with games kids can enjoy while waiting with their parents.

There is a good amount of seating and it wasn't that busy on a weekday night(4-6pm). Overall, great laundry mat.

P.S. A little tip, check the dryer machines for bent  metal that can possibly snag your clothes before putting your clothes in there. I only found one machine like that.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

.
First, there is no hot water machine.
I mean I press hot water. But hot water never come out.
People be very caution. Check the machines when you use. Just touch the screen. Then you know it’s cold or hot.</review>

< review>
First off, ignore the signs reading "24 hours." They failed at that and now are only open 24 hours on the weekend, but decided to not change the signs. Great people. They'll also close early whenever they want, so while they initially changed to closing at 2 a.m. during the week, that soon became 1, then midnight.
Second, when a machine fails, the employees will stare blankly right alongside you before realizing they're the employee and should probably figure something out.
I've gone here for about three years because it was the best option on the block, but I'm through with 'em now. Last time I went they said they were now closing early again, so I had to come back the next day. Then my washer got stuck on rinse cycle. Wish me luck elsewhere.</review>

(Translated by Google) The washing machine is very powerful, so it can be pulled out even when it is not missing elsewhere. First of all, it seems to be at a reasonable price so that you don't put a coin in ridiculously, and the parking lot is wide, and it is really convenient to enter and exit, and the interior is also very spacious and consists of two doors that come in and out. There are 4 large entrances, and the part I like about me is the most grateful to people like me who haven't been there for a long time. It's a perfect launderette with no one..

세탁기가 아주굉장히 힘에좋아서 다른데서 안빠지던묵은때도 뽑아버립니다.우선 터무니없게 동전을넣지않게 적당한가격인것같고 주차장이넓고 들어가고나오고가 정말 편리하게되어있고 실내역시 심하게 넓고 들락거리는두개의문으로되어있는큰 입구가 4방에있습니다.그리고 내가젤 맘에드는부분은 오래못서있는 나같은사람에게 가장 고맙게도 곳곳에 의자들이 있어서 아무데서나 앉아서 빨래도갤수있고 쉴수가있어 거기만 가게되네요...아쉬운점이라할게 하나없는 만점짜리 빨래방이에요..</Text>

<Name>judith strohl</Name><Review>My son has been doing productions there for a couple of years. We went to see "Carrie" the musical last night. Good as it always is. I saw it earlier in this production and my husband was in the hospital so I dragged my son's friend with me. It's a smallish venue on 3rd Ave in Chula Vista. I Recommed this place. Not over priced and it generally is sold out.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Excellent singers and performers. The price is very reasonable. A smallish venue which is a plus for me.  My son does musicals there regularly. I appreciate the talent shown.< /Text>

It is more like Randall than community theater. The quality keeps improving. Shows mix new talent with experienced. A concerted small shop, truly no bad seats in the house. That have taken some chances and produced some very good shows. Combine that with the new and improved 3rd Ave and you can have a great evening.< /Text>

Love this quaint, intimate theatre in the heart of downtown Chula Vista. Under the new artistic director, this space has been renovated and working to bring in larger (and younger) crowds to grow with the expanding night life of 3rd avenue village. The shows are thought provoking and brilliant!! Don't mind the small space, the productions are amazing!!!<//Review>

Small, intimate community theater with incredible staff. We first came to see "Zanadu" and it was really fun. Aisles are a little too narrow and constricting but it has a wide, open stage. No bad seats in the house. This theater definitely has it's charms! And it's exciting that they're bringing together talented, local actors and interesting plays into Chula Vista.<//Text>

Small community playhouse lifted on Third Ave in Chula VIsta. Approximately 40 seats. Good view from each seat. The actors are fine young people. Admission is $25 per ticket. Worth the price. The acting is very good and many other interesting places near by.<//review>

Had the most incredible experience today.
Tom greeted me with a smile and a friendly hello. First thing I noticed was how clean and organized the store was. Pricing was clearly marked and mattresses were arranged by brand and displayed neatly.
I explained to Tom how my boyfriend and I are home with 5 kids, and our old sleep number bed was not working for either of us. I went on to list ours must haves for a new mattress.. me with needing something supportive but plush, and him something that would keep him cool at night. Tom was able to find a perfect mattress for us, and made some other recommendations for add ons. (Like the waterproof mattress topper in case my potty training toddler sleeps over in our bed one night)
We were able to get some really great discounts due to my boyfriends military service, and Tom found the mattress I wanted at 50% from their warehouse. Walked out after my purchase with over $1,600 in savings and I am over the moon happy.
My biggest take away was the impeccable customer service, so thankful for Tom who fielded all of my questions and budget concerns.
Would recommend this place to anyone.
Make sure to tell Tom Betsy and Sean say thanks a million!< /Text>

This store has taken care of me several times. Always friendly and honest. I had inadvertently overpaid cash for a mattress I had purchased for a friend (the bills we're stuck together). They called me the next day to let me know and returned the money. It's great to know people in this world still have integrity and strong character. Go here if you need anything. They will keep you in budget and care about your satisfaction. It may be a small store, but the staff makes up for it in spades. They are simply good people.<//Review>

My first time visiting this store left me with a great impression of true customer service.  I was greeted by Tom with a smile and a genuine desire to make we feel welcomed and left with all the information I needed to make an informed decision.  I called back to make a purchase and am very happy to write a positive review.  From start to finish, delivery and installation, I was very pleased with the outcome.  I didn't expect such immediate results, considering the existing pandemic.    I would definitely recommend this store to those interested in improving their sleep time experience.  Great job all around.  Thank you, Mattress Firm Santee West!<//text>

Despite walking into the store 5 minutes before closing, the lady I spoke to (Janet) was extremely helpful and sincere. She let my wife and I test different beds and gave us recommendations within our budget. We decided to go with the Sleepy's 12" memory foam king mattress and last night was hands-down the best sleep we've had in years. I work between 50-60 hours a week on a computer and this bed is exactly what I've been looking for to help relieve my back and shoulder pain.

This was easily the best (and least stressful) experience I've had at a mattress store. To anyone reading this - I strongly recommend you check out this location. You won't be disappointed!<//review>

For starters, who likes mattress shopping? I went in with the mentally that it was going to be long and boring process before finding the perfect mattress for a good price.

Tom was SOOOOO helpful and made everything so easy, he saved me a trip to the store by emailing a pay link which was such a time saver.

This was probably the best mattress shopping experience I’ve ever had. Definitely ask for Tom when you go in!<//review>

After realizing my lumpy, super old mattress was in desperate need of replacing, I went to the Santee Mattress Firm store on my way home from work, anticipating to walk into a situation with a pushy salesman trying to sell me a mattress. I researched a ton and was set on a Purple mattress, but wasn't sure which type so I decided to go into a store to test them out. Right when I walked in, Thomas was warm and welcoming and directed me to the Purple mattresses. He never once pushed or tried to oversell...he was just pleasant, super knowledgeable, and gave me enough information to make an informed decision on my new mattress. I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent customer service provided by Thomas, and I would absolutely recommend anyone buy a mattress from him.

On the day my mattress was delivered, I received a text with a window of time that I could expect my mattress. Then, I received an email letting me know the driver will arrive within 10 minutes. Marco and Jesus showed up right on time, we’re friendly and efficient. My new mattress was set up within 10 minutes and they even got rid of my old mattress. I was very impressed with my whole experience with Mattress Firm!<//Text>

< Review>
I've never been in love with a bed before! Feeling like Goldie locks that has found the perfect fit. It's a different feel with gel crate & was hesitate at 1st. But husband & I have not woken up with any pain. We're side, stomach & sometimes back sleepers who likes a bit of firm. This bed gives support where we need it, mostly hips and shoulders, yet so comfy every where else. Oddly enough too, it kinda gives you a bounce when getting out of bed. There's days I go to bed early,like 6pm (we use to be night owls going to bed at midnight) just cause I'm so darn comfortable! Plus, being pregnant, this has been my most favorite place to hang out now. It's slightly cool, too cool for my liking but my husband said it could be cooler. So his body temp hasn't changed much (although, could be the sheets) but without my heating blanket, this bed feels ice cold to me. I AM IN LOVE WITH PURPLE! Plus Mattress Firm Santee, Ca was so helpful. I read the bad reviews but we've never had a problem, this is our 2nd mattress purchase, we upgraded to a King. The employees were very helpful and insightful, process and set up is easy.<//Review>

<text>We started at Jeromes Dream shop and upon walking in the door we were attacked by a woman that was desperate for a commission. It was 90 seconds later that I walked out the door. I decided to stop in this place and when we walked in we were greeted by a very nice man that said he would help us in just a bit and to go ahead and look around. I can’t explain how refreshing it is to go to a store and receive customer service. So it  turns out that Thomas Rinear and Teissa Barlina at Mattress Firm were the two people that helped us today, they were amazing. They actually listened and let us proceed at our pace. These two people have a fantastic dynamic together and it comes through to the customer in the form of team work. We are very super satisfied with our purchase and highly recommend that you go see these people. Customer service at its finest and the prices were great too. I will tell everybody I know to go here because of the service I received! Thanks guys :)< /text>< Date>

<Review>We had been thinking about a new bed for a while and decided to stop by and see if my husband could find one that he felt comfortable on.  Right away we met Tom and he was an absolute pleasure to speak with and once he knew what our needs were he showed us our different options and told us the specifics of each mattress, as well as pillows. After finding one we liked we briefly did the numbers and we were set!!  He really took care of my husband and I and listened to what we needed as well as the savings he got us.  Tom, we are so happy to have met you and should we need anything in the future when it comes to our sleeping needs, you will be our first call!  24 hours later, here we are relaxing, watching movies on our new tempurpedic bed with adjustable base!  Here’s to better nights full of comfortable rest!< /Review><Name>Brandi Rembold<//Name>< Date>

Overall good experience.
I only came in because they had the Purple advertisement in the window. Otherwise I was going to buy it online.  They did price match what Purple was selling it for online. The skinny dude I dealt with was calm and easy going.  If you live in a home where the bedrooms are upstairs and you have a Cal-King/King bed, defiantly get the full service delivery and set up.  Otherwise you could get away with not paying for the extra if you have a 1 story home. But the CK/K mattresses are heave and huge. It's worth the price. The only negative is beware of the weighted blankets they sell and ask the right questions. The dude sold me a blanket that I thought was a Purple blanket, but it wasn't.< /text>

<text>Worked with Matt in-store and online to purchase new box spring for King size mattress. My spouse has a chronic illness and Matt was very knowledgeable and explained all the options available in-store as well as suggesting some motion controlled platforms. I was able to purchase online via links Matt set up for me via text and email. Overall was easy and convenient. Thanks for your assistance and expertise Matt!

I Believe Candace was the one who helped me, but I’ve been in search Everywhere for a Tempur-pedic mattress. But just looking for the best price. I fortunately ran into Candace at the Santee location. She help me so much to try to find the best mattress that would apply to my knees. Definitely going back if I ever do I need a mattress again.< /text>

I had a general idea of what I wanted, going in today; however, Teissa was very helpful bringing me to three different mattress options, at three different brands and price points, and helping me pick the best option for me. She was polite and professional, and was not pushy at all, in expecting me to buy/add-on, etc., and overall her explanations of what I was getting were spot on, and the experience was very positive.< /Review>

<Text>We were dire need of a new mattress and stumbled in this store and was almost immediately greeted by Mary. She started asking us all kinds of questions to figure out what we needed and in a few minutes had us laying down and trying different mattresses. She was such a pleasure to work with and super knowledgeable. We walked away with a queen mattress and they got us set up with financing and out the door all set up super quick. All of our questions were answered and everything was super straight forward. Definitely recommend! If you are in need of a new mattress don’t hesitate, come in and see Mary! You won’t regret it!<//Text><username>Kimberly Alba< /username>< Rate>

Candace was very helpful! I told her my needs and what I was looking for in a new bed. I’ve been dealing with back pain for a couple years and I also sleep better in a cool temp bed. She helped me narrow down the best sleeping arrangement for me, plus with their Labor Day weekend sale I got so much more at a great price. Candace was also very inclusive of my 10 year old son who was with me, which was very sweet and added the “cherry on top” of a great shopping experience. Thank you Candace and Mattress Firm!<//Text>

I have been wanting/ needing an adjustable base for years due to my bad back, sleep apnea, and reflux. Turns out the free bases are very basic so we decided to by an upgraded base instead and keep our mattress. We have to wait 1.5 weeks for delivery but I'm ok with that.

<review>I want to start off by saying tom or thomas is the best worker i have came across in a very long time. My wife and I spent maybe hour  or longer inside the store. He didnt rush us he didnt try to sell us everything. He was very professional and kind. One complaint i have is that every employee or worker is Not like  tom. We were able to find the perfect match for us and he took care of every need. SometimeS making a big purchase can be nerve racking , but with tom it was easy and he was simply a joy to talk to! Thank you again for the best customer service and the relationship we built! I will recommend him and mattress firm to others without any doubt!<//review>< pictures>

Just purchased a mattress after working with Candace. We visited several of their competitors and none of their mattresses just nailed it. After two minutes of listening to what we’re looking for, Candace showed us three mattresses that were a dream. She was extremely nice and super patient with us as we tried to narrow down which mattress we loved most. I highly recommend coming in and working with her to find your dream mattress! Candace is a delight, completely transparent about all prices, & not pushy in the slightest. She’s super personable and you won’t regret working with her.</Review>

<review>Wow I am literally blown away by the customer service here my husband and I were looking to buy the purple mattress and we actually ordered it from the purple website but when we came to this store to try out the mattress we actually loved the customer service so much and how they were so willing to go out of there way to help us and make sure we were happy with our purchase we stopped  the order with Purple and purchased it at Mattress FIRM in Santee . Candace literally worked her magic and got us our mattress the same weekend we bought it . And kept it in our budget! She was literally on her way out the door when we got to the store and stayed to help us ! I would not go anywhere else they are patient kind and do ANYTHING to make sure your satisfied. I would and will recommend this specific store to anyone !! This location is the best! Thank you Candace !!!! Thank your Mattress Firm Santee !!</review>< GmapID>

Candice and Floyd are super helpful! We came in just to browse the mattresses and they were both informative on which type would be better for me. Also told me about some floor models they had for discount as well. Will definitely referral my friends as well!<//review>

<text>Floyd was awesome! We came in with the mattress we had in mind for the Labor Day sale, and he was so straight forward and located the one we were looking for. Let me lay down, I said I loved it, and we bought it then and there! He’s even having it delivered to the Santee store for pick up instead of making me go to Miramar! You’re the best, Floyd, thank you!</text>< Pics>

He also helped us with a box spring, bed frame that matched our house, and a credit card to help us pay for it all over time. What a great experience!<//text>< Pics>

If you are looking for a mattress, this is the place to go! Who knew there were so many options when going to purchase a mattress, but Floyd helped make the process of picking out the right mattress super easy! He was very knowledgeable, patient and considerate of what I was looking to spend. The Simmons mattress that I purchased is amazing and just what I have been looking for!
Make sure to go in and see Floyd!</Review>

Very pleased with our experience at this store.  Purchased a bed for our motor home from Wesley, who gave us an awesome price, even lower then the sale price.  Got the mattress home and it was too firm.  Called Wesley, expecting a hassle, but not at all.  Went back, Wesley was off and we met Simon.  Fortunately Wesley had left notes on our account about our issues.  Simon found us another mattress, more expensive, but he met the other price.  Gave us a killer deal on delivery too.  Got the mattress a few minutes ago and its perfect!  This is our second bed from this company and what a "no pressure" "excellent" and "no hassell" experience.  Five Stars!!< /Text>

<Time>1499848197786<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>I came in a little bit before the 4th of July, yet they already had the sale started. Well, Antoinette helped us out so incredibly much that we were happy that we bought the bed from her. I still intend to get her a Subway gift card as a little thank you. She not only gave me a 10% discount on top of the sale, but made it 15% because I'm a veteran, despite the fact that I didn't have my vet ID on me, and took my word for it. Next, the computer wasn't working, so she took off another $300 to make our transaction an even $2000, which apparently helped the system process it. A friendly shoutout to the manager, Tony, who hooked us up with a free $200 pillow simply because there was some confusion about when our bed was getting delivered.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>When I worked here This place had  me go do estimates for jobs  Big jobs I used my time then they  gave the jobs to someone . They also would take half or more of my pay for jobs cuz someOne was riding with me the manger who didn’t do the work I did and I was  also told  he needs be paid  half when he did nothing just cuz he rode with me  . Also would ask me to take the day off like FridayS  and then tell me yea u didn’t make ur quota so we r paying u minimum wage  for this week. Not honest Company  . I was even told one day don’t worry I will not take this one from u meaning take out half my pay for the carpet cleaning job . Basically they steal from employees.

Terrific experience! Quoting, measuring, and installation appointments for our kitchen countertops were all on-time, professional, and courteous. Installation went flawlessly, and we're very happy with the final product. I would work with them again in a heartbeat!</Review>

Flooring, Windows, and carpet are done well, good materials and installers are good.The flooring department Sandy and Katie are extremely rude. Almost every conversation I have had with them has included some kind of snarky Rude comment or attitude. I would suggest reconsidering both of them. I work with them regularly. The guy from Window coverings is fantastic! He offers great customer service.</Text>

I had another great experience dealing with bonded carpet. I’ve been a customer of bonded carpet since 1986. I am very impressed at how great they have always been and how they always exceed my expectations on every project I use them on. Just recently case in point I had and tenant move out of the house I rent out after they had been living there for over five years. Not having any free time or wanting to deal with this in the middle of my busy work schedule, I called a Bonded Carpet and gave them the address in told them the key was under the mat. They went in and figured out exactly what I needed to do in the way of carpeting and floor coverings so that it would last the maximum period of time provide a very quality luxurious look for a house rental. They also just suggested in the bathroom that I down linoleum that looks like stone. This really enhanced the look/value of the rentals appearance. In order to help me make the decision on what materials to use easy Paula did great consulting by providing three different products combinations for me to pick. Looking at the contrast between the three examples made the decision simple and easy and provided no remorse. I normally take a long time to make a decision but I was able to make the decision in five minutes or less. I gave them the order on the spot. They moved very quickly within a few days the house was ready to rent to the next family in Carlsbad. If you’re looking for company that can provide you excellent value customer service and great products and excellent value call bonded carpet they will satisfy you today tomorrow and 10 years from now!

Signed

Alex and his crew installed carpet in our home last week. Johnnie and the sales/service staff were always helpful and professional. These guys are pros. Everything looks amazing and it feels like a new home! Total install and cleanup time was done in about 2-hours. They were very accommodating throughout the entire process. I did about a month's worth of research before choosing a carpet company and I could not be happier with our choice. Bonded Inc provided the best overall value for our budget.< /text>

They used to be fairly good. But in the last few years company getting to big. Quality of work is not good. Very sloppy. Last 2 carpet installs had to have someone come back and spend a few hours fixing bad seams,bad cuts,not kickin properly,metals not replaced. So tenant had to move their things again. Made appointment they did not show,did not call,I phone them they didn't know where the guy was.</review>

Made a huge deal about not wanting to start work until someone was present at the property...that would be fine except they claimed they were going to be there "in the morning" - which of course meant they called at 11:55am to say "we are on our way."

I understand the position that there has to be some trust between vendor/client so that work is done well and payment is made in a timely fashion...but they really dropped the ball here. I especially liked the part where they said "we will leave if you don't show up to pay us." No sorry we are late, no discount, nothing but "well we have been stiffed before."

I probably wont use them again...and FYI on carpet install, they were OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced (one of our clients used them for a 1000 sqft two story condo - cost $2500).

Denise - next time start with - "we are sorry, we will work to make this right"<//Text>

Very pleased with the laminate and vinyl  flooring that Bonded Inc. installed at our home in Chula Vista, CA.

The Installer Chris Holmes was outstanding very detail oriented installing our laminate floors, and stairs. Home Depot, Lowe's and other company said - they can not do our stairs and will not look good, but Chris Holmes did an outstanding job on our stairs.

We were so pleased and happy with Bonded Inc. so we decided to have  our entire second floor (MBR, guest room, loft and bathrooms) done.

We highly recommend Bonded reasonable price, good quality materials and very professional workmanship.  Rudy was our salesperson/estimator and Chris Holmes was our floor installer.< /review>

Choosing bonded to do my window blinds was the best interior design decision i've ever made. The sales staff was very knowledgable and friendly while they walked me through the different styles that would work best for my place. I used them for my floors too, which I always get compliments on! Thanks guys< /Review>

Do not do business with them.  I contacted the owner to get my blinds repaired (purchased through them), he was rude, combative, and plain and simple mean.  His words, "I sell cheap, low-end blinds, its cheaper to buy new ones...do your business elsewhere."  That is great advice, I will definitely take my business elsewhere.< /text>

I have been working with Bonded Flooring, carpet cleaning and window coverings for nearly 30 years.

They have long been my go-to company for all flooring, floor cleaning, and window convering needs and have consistently provided exceptional, quality, and timely service.

I do and will continue to recommend them to all in need of these types of services.

<text>Horrible! If I could pick 0 stars I would. We have had bonded send to our apartment on 3 sperate flood occasion (not by choice). The first time they came they pulled up the carpet and said we would hear from someone the next day. 3 days passed before I called to see what was happening. No one even communicated the work that was done. The second flood incident they came they pulled up the carpet and said they would be there next day to check if it was dry. Came the next day and it wasn't dry so had to come back the following day to check again. No show AGAIN! This most recent time they came the first day, then didnt show the second day! When we called we not only told them no one showed up but that the carpet was dry and ready to be repadded and cleaned. So when they sent someone out they brought nothing with them and just checked to see if the carpet was wet. So now we are at day 4! They came and measured wrong and didn't have enough padding so had to come the next day. That was today, day 5 and guess what. No one showed up. If you want to have your time completely wasted go ahead and call this completely unprofessional company with no communication skills.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I have had the pleasure of working with Bonded for 20 plus years. Being in the property management business we rely on our vendors for excellence in speed,pricing and most of all quality.
I can say without hesitation that their level of customer service is outstanding and it is always a pleasure to work with them!

I've used Bonded a handful of times and they are always very professional with their service. The installation of carpet, VCT and base was great and would recommend them to any other General Contractor.< /Text>

I went in to get a part. With the part number furnished by Cummins. The other places I went to prior. Just keyed in the part number. "Sorry, no part". Went to Nor Cal Kenworth. Keyed in the number. No part. But, Salesman: MTV. Said hold on a minute. Went back into the parts warehouse. A couple minutes later. He came out with the item I needed. That was fantastic. Not Cal Kenworth rocks.<//Text>

I will stick with TA where you can talk to the mechanic who is going to work on your truck.

Just had to address an issue at my fuse box and was reminded of the poor work this place did. I asked them to take their time and fix the wiring situation near the fuse box. they just zip-tied the wires and shoved them out of the way. I am unable to get the fuse puller back in the holder. These people are in too big of a rush.

They didn't even diagnose the problem with my trans temp gauge. I had a TA mechanic plug in the diagnostic computer and low and behold, trans temp gauge voltage problem. Proof that they didn't even attempt to actually fix the problem.<//review>< pictures>

Had my truck repaired here because I prefer to use the dealer and will definitely never be back to this location.  My truck seems to be working alright but the service management is horrible at this location.  They would make promises they had no intention of keeping and lie to my face about when they recieved parts and when they actually worked on my truck.  Will definitely be seaking out other repair centers when the time comes again</review>

Kenworth Sacramento is overloaded with work. Their mechanics are 1st class and the repairs are done right the first time which is why I gave 3 stars. However the average turnaround is 6 days. A very long wait for return to duty.< /review>

We do understand your frustration though with the turn around time. Having a truck out of service for a week is not convenient. As a part of NorCal Kenworth, we do have a leasing and rental division - NorCal Truck Leasing - that can help when a truck is in the shop longer than anticipated. If you are interested in getting a rental account set up give us a call at 866-572-2525 and talk to our Leasing/Rental team to see what program might work for you.'}< /Resp><gmap_id>0x809ad7813a23fd2b:0x3ae6bbd7973a113d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

For people who are planning to visit this service center. I visited this place, in order to fix leaking. After I picked up my truck, leaking appeared again.They did not fix the issue. Their work is far from satisfied. Good luck guys, try to check your equipment, before leaving the shop.</Review>

Steeped in service to ask a question about my truck the morning time. The heavy set guy at the end was arguing with employee and complaining he had to much to do. I waited a little bit He did not acted like he wanted to help me. I ended up asking someone else in the shop they helped me. They need to do something with this guys anger and treating people like that.<//text>

I stood in an empty parts room for 20 minutes and just watched as two employees at the front counter chit-chatted, I counted about 50 profanities in the presence of a customer, at one point it became a game for me to see how long it would take for someone to greet me. I also witnessed two supervisors walk by and join in the conversation yet was still never greeted or served, eventually I had to walk up and interrupt the two in order to get a simple 30 second transaction finished. This has been what I have come to expect from large international companies like this, if your going to go here, expect to be treated like a piece of paperwork.< /text>

Came in to get some work done on one of my trucks . They told me I was 2 weeks out before they could get to me! Before I could say anything.
As the fat guy with no name and someone named Pat was complaining that they have no Mechanics. Than  a mechanic comes up to tell them something and they where Ruud to Him.
do I need to say anymore
I can see being busy but no wonder they cant get to you!! I went to Peterbilt instead no problem there!!</Text>

I have been hauling for a few years now and wanted to own my own truck and start making some real money. I went to a few dealerships and then luckily found NorCal Kenworth. They were by far the most helpful, knowledgeable and worked very hard for me to get the truck I have dreamed of. The financing was easy and the Finance Manger Jeff was very clear and worked with me during the process. Honestly, I was very impressed from start to finish.<//review>

Bought 2 trucks from them in the past 5 years both were lemons almost destroyed our business!! I also bought warranty too for 4,000.. every single thing that broke, the warranty didn't cover!! There was always a fine print that got around it!!.. Be very careful when you purchase a big rig from Norcal kenworth in Sacramento or in general if it is not bran new they wont hesitate to take your money while they sell you a lemon that could end your business or cost you a fortune thinking ok if I just fix this then it will work fine...NO it wont!!! Something else will break right after you fix the last and it just never ends!! Take a mechanic with you if you're planning to buy from them if you can, bc they do not give a damn about you and yours....< /text>

Horrible place had a plug fall off took 2 days to get them to look at it. 24hrs to get the plug it plug arrives sits on the parts counter for 3 hrs when I ask why I'm told the tech doesn't come in until 1:30 now 3 hrs later still in the shop nothing being done but they sure don't miss break time. Absolutely the worse service I've ever experienced in 23 years on the road total lack of give a crap for the customer. Do yourself a favor get towed to reno might cost more but you'll be back on road making money in half the time. Shame on nor cal kenworth.<//text>

No way. A place of Utter Disappointment. This place is a professionally done rip off,
a rip off, you want to know how?

Look and see for your self whether you are an owner operator or a large trucking company you will not want to lose money because of dishonest business, even, if its just one single case.  I never had batteries fail on my truck. So I was away from the truck for  about a week, one morning went to it to start it, and its dead. Next thing arranged for truck to be checked for shorts, no shorts! The wiring checks out ok! Lemon batteries. Not too pleasant especially on a trip.

Calling NOR CAL Kenworth where I got the batteries from, 13 months ago. Explained the guy that my truck HAS NO SHORTS, IT CHECKS OUT OK! Instead he totally ignores me, and what I hear back is: that the the parts dep guy does not talk a word on batteries, that they could be of poor quality, but is pushing me to bring the box truck into their shop for diagnostics, what I do not need to do.
I am asking him why do I need to bring a perfectly fine truck, which already tested out ok, to the repair shop, when it is evidently the batteries at fault and not the truck? ( thought: well, sell the quality stuff don't push junk and later on have people go insane)

The guy states this is the only way you will find out what is wrong with the truck, you must bring it in to the shop.
He was just pushing my truck is to blame, and not their batteries quality. Wow.
I would agree, if the truck wasn't already tested!!! Does he listen to me at all???!

I said, if this testing is free, just for you to be sure of what is going on, I could bring in the truck still knowing that it is perfectly fine.The answer is: No sir you will have to pay for the truck diagnostics.
I said the truck is having NO ISSUE it has already been tested and found ok. It is the batteries that are not ok them selves, that is the only thing left to be in fault in this situation, and  it can not be any other way.

If Kenworth really needs to know for them selves I can let an access to the truck to check, but I have done nothing to deserve to be charged for. These two batteries are a junk, or a lemon consider it any way, because nothing else is left for a sane person to see here. These batteries are under two year warranty, give me normal quality stuff and its guaranteed you will never hear from me again.

Instead of helping the NOR CAL KENWORTH PARTS DEP guy simply loudly hangs up on me. You see and read that right, I was evidently hanged up on by a person you would very much hope to be helped for.

Now imagine that you are in this situation, do you want it upon you? How do you think you would feel if you have dealt with this Kenworth location and they are dealing you in this way? Do you want this done to you?

Bottom line: They are pushing you into their shop to charge you, even when you are already just after the diagnostics from another solid reliable place that found your vehicle at no fault.
That is, especially, if NorCal Kenworth has a warranty claim on a part they sold you

Here you realize that if you get this much charged for unneeded, but forced diagnostics, then your warranty claim makes no sense, becomes nulls for you, but not for them.  you rather buy new batteries again, right there. Got it? Explaining again, by forcing you into their shop when you dont need it, they leave nothing of your warranty value, you are further in minus< /text>

My Grandpa is here now and is recovering very well. They are attentive and he loves all his nurses. They do allow you to visit the patients in the lobby which is really nice. Their core values are posted at the entrance and their employees truly resemble them. They all go out of their way to make you smile and feel special.<//text>

They abuse their elderly patients, leave them with bed sores and have them on dirty oxygen masks. The care here is horrendous</Review>

I spent 3 weeks here at Kindred hospital and I received excellent care and service from the nursing staff and from the management here at Kindred hospital. What is remarkable to me is that the management and supervisors came on the floor and helped patients with their needs I needed water for my high flow and the supervisor for the RT department changed my water for me know that it's great service. Also I want to recognize Ms Palmer patient advocate she's really attentive and really helps the needs of the patient she is a great advocate. Kindred Hospital is a great place.<//review>

Please disregard the score of a ONE STAR! I would give this facility a MINUS ZERO if I could.  They do not deserve one star.  If you are thinking about placing a loved one here...PLEASE DON'T if you love him/her! My son was in this facility and I wished I would have read this type of  a review because I did read  reviews before he came.  The reviews were right about unit 100 and the poor care there. The hospital  have a doctor there by the name of Deepak Thiagarajon (AKA Dr. Rajon) that was HORRIBLE!  They pumped my son 34 year old son with medications that affected his heart when his heart was totally healthy. You don't get to play God with people lives. When my son passed, Dr. Rajon's exact words to me in the ER room were "Ms. Williams, your son is dead." They all from the head departments chief officer etc. all had a plan to not care properly for my son as I tried to be his advocate. I was given false hopes  by Jackie one of the head administration. She told me my son could be possibly transported when she had a plan as well. We really do reap what we sow in life when wrong is done. Ann Marie was compassionate and at least just listened as I discussed by son's care. I pray for their SOULS...we all will be held accountable for our actions in life when wrong is done. I FORGIVE each of them and pray for people in that facility.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I just want to say this place is amazing. During these difficult times they have gone above and beyond to take care of my mom. I would call everyday for an update and no one ever made me feel like I was bothering them. At least once a week I would get a call to give me the overall condition of my mom and what different treatments or care she has needed. That was on top of my daily calls. When she first got there she was in a coma so I couldn't talk to her personally but they always kept me informed about everything going on. Due to the extra precautions I wasn't able to visit her but even when she was in a coma the social worker would go to her room so I could video chat her and get to see her. Because of their dedication to my mom's health she is now going to the next stage of recovery. If this next facility is even half as awesome as Kindred Rancho than she will be home in no time. Thank you to the amazing staff for your never ending care for my mom. Because of you she will be home before I know it. No words can express my gratitude. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. ❤️❤️❤️<//review>< pics>

<Review>I just spent 7 weeks at Kindred. It is a good solid facility that provides very good care. What sets this facility apart is its amazing staff. They really do care about their patients. Some are there are just there for a paycheck but most really care. The staff rotates every day so I came in contact with almost everyone. I would like to take a little time to tell you about some of the staff that really made a difference in my life.
RNs:
Harjot (who along with LVN Alyssa saved my life)
Irene
Christiana
Daniel
James
Maria
All these nurses always went the extra mile to make sure my needs were met

LVNs
Rich and Alyssa were awesome and always there when I called

CNAs
Tracey
Rachel
Brandy
Carmen
Maria
These women have a really tough job and were always short staffed, but they always had a smile on their faces and always took care of business

RT
Tiffany was great. She always made sure my CPAP had water and even cam in my room at 3am every morning to add water.

PT Staff
Amy, Janice, Meagan and Ceasar were absolutely amazing! This team of professionals have made a profound difference in my life. When I arrived at the facility I was really depressed and had a lot of anxiety. They all took the time to build me  up and I could make it through this. I will always be grateful and they will always have a special place in my heart. They  are truly an asset to this facility.</Review>< Pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Loma Linda transfered my boyfriend to this hospital 10/23/20.
I called Kindred and spoke to one of the ICU unit. I asked her if he was going to be giving another dosage of Remdesivir and if he was goung to be put in a prone position. I was extremely shocked when she asked me what the 2 were....she had no clue. And mind you she is an ICU nurse. On 10/25/20 I called to ask how he was doing. Another ICU nurse answered my call. She told me he was in a very critical condition. My name was taken off the list so I know she could not say much. I started crying and I asked her to please tell me if he was ok. This is her reply " I don't have time to be hearing cry, I can't help you. Don't have time for you or your crying".
My boyfriend passed away on the 27th. This is a terrible place to take your love one's to. No compassion, not caring. Very mean and rude. And to add to it lacking knowledge of what's going on with covid.
Please don't allow for your love one's to be taken to that place. My boyfriend died within 3/4 days of been transfered to Kindred.< /text>< pictures>

I have to say that at first I was not happy she was coming to this hospital because one of my friends had they're dad here and he ended up not improving at all. But my sister has turned the corner here. I visit after work and the hospital is clean and quiet, the nurses stop by when you call them and they are nice, and they keep her pain free. Special shout out  to nurse Chris and Lorene, who were nice to my sister and me, nursing assistant Cindy, the supervisor penny and Lorena.  My sister also says the food is good, they also give snacks, and that her doctor let's her know of changes to her treatment and that her therapy is going good. We hope she be able to get out of the hospital soon because she's doing so much better!

<time>1575199186283< /time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>To the owner of this horrible place that is suppose to be a good hospital, you should be ashamed of yourself because I know you are aware of all the bad reviews you have on here and yet your hospital is still providing horrible care for parents and some of your staff in ICU is very unprofessional and disrespectful. Your night secuity is racist and unprofessional as well. I hope that this review will open your eyes as to the changes that need to be made asap. I'm sure that you've had a few law suis already. The way my family was treated today was unreal  and disrespectful being that my aunt is going to pass away in the matter of hours or days from the doctors update.They told my family that visiting hours were over when my cousin tells my aunt's nurse if the nurses station can keep the noise down because they were having  personnel conversations and laughing all loud.
My aunts nurse kicked out my family from the cafeteria earlier in the day and gave my family an unpdate that was vital important information that was also told in front of minors and that violated my aunt's hippa rights. The nurse also told my little cousins to say there goodbyes because she is going to die. Please don't leave any family alone at this place. God help us, because the medical system in this country is very unfortunate and greedy. There is no excuse for this type of experience.  ❤🙏<//Review>< pics>

< review>
I wanted to Thank everyone at Kindred for helping me recover from my tracheostomy which was a necessity after two intubations and CPAP/ Bipap not allowing my CO2 levels to normalize. I was very nervous at first and just having had to be tube fed with no voice, Patricia (nurse) made me comfortable right away with her upbeat sweetness. Learning how to care for a trach can be a process but luckily I had several good RT’s (respiratory therapists) to help. Heather was always offering knowledge and was quick to help out, Tiffany was thorough and watchful when I was afraid to try CPAP again — she checked on me several times to make sure I was comfortable. Johanna was so encouraging even when I had a couple of hard days. Patrick took his time to answer all of the questions (which there were many).  I love Luis’s sense of humor and he was very upbeat. My original trach was too big:hence, the speak valve and eating/swallowing were out of the question until it was changed. Luis changed it with his partner in seconds making the process very easy. I have to say being bed bound at the beginning was not fun for me but Rosa, Rich, Bree along with many other nurses really helped me feel more dignified and took great care of me. I even got my hair washed which is very difficult with a new trach.   Henoch was extremely good with IV’s and NG tubes. Lupe was so quick, responsive and helped me greatly with everything from paperwork to mundane duties. She made a huge difference in my last few days at Kindred. My speech therapist ,Jojo,  was also very good: she made sure it would be safe to eat, drink before I started. She looked at my history and did tests accordingly.  I also could barely sit up when I first got to Kindred. Debra (my occupational therapist) first got me standing as well my physical therapists: Janice and Cesar after one week. Pretty soon we were standing and then walking. My other occupational therapist, Lauren, came back and she trained me on self care so I could go home. The doctors at this hospital are fantastic. Dr. Phan is so thorough and brilliant. His analysis of my blood work took care of problems I have had for over a year! Dr. Sandu whom performed my surgery (with Dr. Abudali another wonderful doctor) would follow up every other day on recovery status. Dr. Houramy is an extremely empathetic,spiritual, and sharp pulmonologist who came in with inspiring words frequently. He also really listened to my concerns and treated me accordingly. I absolutely thought the Infectious disease specialist Dr. Guiang was very thorough (of course) to make sure all the pneumonia was gone and she also came in with encouragement every day. Of course my patient advocates and case workers helped me greatly as well. Thank you Lisa, Mary, Lorilyn and Cindy!! Thanks to all of these people, I was able to come home, have a smooth transition. I am off oxygen at times and walking without any help at times (this is my 2nd day home). I am starting to do more and more for myself. I couldn’t have done this without the collaboration of all these hospital workers. I am very grateful. THANK YOU KINDRED!<//review>

My father was admitted to this facility in late November of 2017. The staff of ICU were very professional and helpful, until my father was sent to unit 1. We have set several complaints over unsanitary and lack of staff professionalism. During the night time the staff seems to disappear. I have spoke to Victor from administration, which was helpful in the beginning with my family's concern. Couple days later my had been unattended and his room was dirty. I called Victor to his personal phone and texted him images of the issue and did not bother to reach out to me. If you are bringing your family member make sure to have a system in where people can rotate to guard the patient. If you are not top of the staff they will do whatever they desire.

Kerry the wound specialist was great and helpful, but again the issue is on Unit 1. The staff lacks on professionalism and meeting up with their duty requirements. Again if you are bringing your family member. Make sure to be able to have someone to guard the patient at all times and be on top of the staff.<//Text>

My Brother in law was here. I have a neutral feeling about this place. The ICU nurses were great. Half the med/surg Telemetry  nurses knew his condition and treatments and the other half did not. They lost his cell phone charger twice, once upon moving from one unit to another, and the other time straight from the room. Neither the RN manager nor the person in charge of client services called me back in regards to this. The security staff at the door were always very nice.<//text>

My family member has had poor care. A couple of days in a row they didn't provide a blanket.  We had to request a blanket.  He was freezing because he has poor circulation. He's on dialysis and they were not doing it correctly and he became overloaded with fluids. I actually corrected the problem. I certainly would NOT recommend this facility.</review>

<review>My wife was here for over 7 weeks.  All the people I met here were very professional and caring.  The nurses taking care of my wife went up and beyond the call of duty.  My wife has made a remarkable recovery and the doctors were very knowledgeable and consulted with me about my wife’s condition.  First I want to thank Valerie who took a special interest in Susie to get her off the ventilator, without her expertise and guidance my wife would have been on the vent weeks longer.  Thankyou Leonard for heading up top notch RT team.  Chrissian made my wife smile in the dark days of her stay.  All the nurses who helped my wife recover were a Godsend.  Angie, what can I say, your sense of humor saved the day many times and your knowledge and professionalism will not be forgotten.  The PT team of Janice and Caesar for setting goals and being behind my wife to meet those goals was nothing short of a miracle.  I will recommend this hospital to anyone needing acute or long term care that needs professional and personal care.  Thankyou Dr Fu for your great bedside manner and expertise.  Many people I have met here will never be forgotten for all you have done for my wife to make her well again.</review><Resp>None< /Resp><Time>1545487861816</Time>< Pics>

Very unprofessional place they're nice people but nothing what you'd expect from a hospital. The nurses/receptionist gather in a group to talk and joke around. The place looks dirty. The nurse kept touching everything (even the phone) with his gloves still on. The little room where they take people to ask them what's going on with them has no privacy, I could hear what they where saying while I was in the waiting room. I'm glad I wasn't the patient.</review>< Pics>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Due to a diagnosis of lymphoma in February 2018, my husband has been hospitalized in different facilities since he became ill. He has currently been a patient at Kindred since July, 2018. Kindred Hospital Rancho has been a great place for my husband and our family. All staff, from the security up front, administrative, patient support, janitorial, CNA's, LVN's, RN's, RT's,  Range of motion therapists, and Wound Care, have been caring, kind and attentive. Any small concerns we might have, have been dealt with immediately.  How could I have left out the Doctors? Even though the doctors are not in the hospital at all times, they came everyday and were always easily accessible if they needed to be reached. We had the opportunity to meet many of the physicians that practice there. I found them to be compassionate, caring and easy to communicate with.I recommend Kindred Hospital whole heartedly.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c335e4333e1547:0xb8511f8894209188< /GmapID></record>

<text>NOT RECOMMENDED!!!
We transferred my dad from Kindred Ontario in the hopes that we would get a better care/service for my dad.  Unfortunately,  it was not.  The nurses were very rude and unprofessional.   One of them wanted to administer double antibiotics.  A doctor spoke to me stating that my dad would be discharged the following day, but another doctor said he wasn't ready.  Case management said no, that he was a new patient to them and that would not be possible.  Nurses did not help much.  We had to call them once, twice, and many more times.  I spoke with  Mary in case management.   She was very helpful in arranging everything for my dad to leave, but things were not done right.  Mary insisted that my dad had the oxygen before he left so he would not be at risk since my dad needs oxygen.  They let my dad go WITHOUT oxygen.  They had the oxygen tank and didn't connected to the tracheostomy.   My sister had to bring him without oxygen because they did not connected.  She asked and they said he would be fine.  They didn't even give her discharge paperwork.  The oxygen concentrator was delivered to the house, but the tank was delivered to the hospital.  My dad has a tracheostomy and they sent a nose cannula instead of trache cannula.  Shortly after we got home, my dad couldn't breathe.  We are now back in the hospital due to unfortunate situation.< /text><Rate>1< /Rate>< userid>

<text>When my mom was first transferred here it was great! Every dept was on top of it. But as WITH ANY HOSPITAL OR FACILITY..if a family member is not here EVERY DAY! the care diminishes. I talk to every nurse, Dr, specialist daily..i go over med charts daily cuz they ALL overmedicated. Yesterday my mom was laying in piss full towels with a leaking catheter..she also has a bad rash all over face & body from a antibiotic they started.,I make it CLEAR everywhere that she is allergic to most antibiotics and needs BENEDRYL with it.. Well NOBODY noticed the rash &,no BENEDRYL! She also is having a major gout flare up in her hands..swollen and red & hot hands. Nobody listened to her? I told them it's gout & we need prednisone asap to fix it!  She can't have anti inflammatories due to stage 3 kidney failure. I'm not a damn Dr but I know my,mom! She is in so much pain I just wanna cry..and I,am! SO BOTTOM LINE..WHEREVER YOU GO MAKE SURE A COMPETENT FAMILY MEMBER IS THERE DAILY! He'll the hospitals in the high desert would have killed her because they never read charts for allergies etc.. And seriously? Adavan is the favorite RX everywhere..bcuz it knocks the patient out & they don't have to deal with them. We are taking mom home Sunday & pulling all meds. It's CBD OIL only going forward.. Good luck to all families in a crisis< /text>< Pics>

My father has been at Kindred Rancho since Feb. 2017. He has received excellent care in all three units: ICU, 100's and 200's. On the whole, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and care about my father. There are a few exceptions - RT's that are a bit rough or lazy, a particular group of nurses that always gather in a group and talk. But everyone, from the social worker, nurses, Drs., management - they know my father personally, know his case and  do their best to take care of them. They have been responsive to my concerns, contact me for any issues with my Dad, and even the Drs. call to discuss his treatment and plan. My family has been very happy and grateful for the wonderful treatment our father gets.</Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>This is a terrible facility. If your patient is in need of close, careful, around the clock care, this isn't the place for you. They neglect their patients, the nurses are nowhere to be found when in serious need and were found far from their patients on their phones. In my experience, the patient that we were visiting was not connected to the nurses station, so the patient could've been flat lining, and the nurses wouldn't have known because they don't check on their patients and the station would not have notified them. Extremely unprofessional and they're only there for a paycheck. If you have the choice, take your patient anywhere but this facility.</Text>< user>

(Translated by Google) To this day I have had a bad experience with this hospital with doctors, nurses, case workers .. My sister after defeating covid was transferred to this hospital where instead of improving this more bad .. They do not give her the care that she needs is being ignored because she cannot speak .. Her personal care is in terrible condition which I have already reported on several occasions ..

Hasta el día de hoy eh tenido una mala experiencia con este hospital con doctores,enfermeras, case worker..Mi hermana después de vencer covid fue transferida a este hospital donde en vez de mejorar esta más mal.. No le dan el cuidado que ella necesita está siendo ignorada por motivo de que no puede hablar.. Su cuidado personal está en pésima condición lo cual yo ya eh reportado en varias ocasiones..<//Text>

There's nothing more LA than supporting local businesses and artists at this must-see market for clothing, jewelry, artwork, furniture, and pretty much anything else you can imagine. Buy your tickets online ahead of time to skip the line when you arrive. Keep in mind that parking can be hard to find!< /text>

Don't go during the pandemic, guys. Bought tickets before realizing how crowded it was. Most people were wearing masks BESIDES THE PERSON WHO CHECKED OUR TICKETS...?! I didn't see any vendors clean any of their merchandise at any point. It seems like a breeding ground. Definitely wait to come until COVID 19 passes.<//Review>

Overpriced. No "Trading" going on. Hipster Hangout. Gone are the days of anything worthwhile vintage. $5 to enter, I got a huge bag of pine cones as they are everywhere on the ground for the taking. Def $5 worth of cones, RIP Melrose Trading Post.< /Text>

It was $5 per adult to enter. We parked for free up the street in the residential area because it was Sunday. I didn't think anything was swap meet pricing and I think most of the second hand stores from Melrose Ave. opened a booth here. It was an entertaining afternoon and the Pad Thai from the food truck was delicious.</text>

<review>MTP - As of 3/28- awesome place to shop vintage and high and low brow wares. Must wear a mask to enter and pay for a ticket. Proceeds benefit art programs for the fairfax highschool grounds that the market takes place on. Some vendors will also negotiate the prices. I bought a vintage italian sweater from the 70s for $25 instead of 35. And a Canon 35 mm camera from ' 99 for $60.
Not bad!
They also have many garden and house plants as well as holistic and organic options to clean your home.
But if you're looking for cheap costume jewelry, sun glasses and the perfect distressed tee, this ... Is the spot to be.< /review>< pictures>

Definitely come by, tons of very cool vendors and unique stuff. Absolutely worth visiting if you're looking for some retro goods (clothes, vinyls, postcards). Don't confuse this with a vintage store or thrift market, these are artisans and these goods are not necessarily cheap.</review>

Great choice of vendors! The vibe here was so chill! Found some good stuff. Plants galore! Go early when it's not so damn hot. There are a few food trucks. I got super lucky with the parking but it is a challenge getting down Genesee Ave. Very narrow street.  Looking forward to my next visit.</Review>

<Time>1541489248855</Time><review>The place to find unique one-off items. From clothing and accessories to furniture and trinkets. I love wandering around the aisles, getting lost and promising myself not to spend any more money. Hard to do.

They raised entrance fee prices from $3 to $5. Cash is best to have on you for most of these merchants.

Come right when it opens to find the best items. Or if you just want to browse, take your time and get here before they close or else you’ll get a million reminders on the loud speaker about closing in x-amount of minutes.

There’s a cute food court area - all located out doors. Get coffees here, rest your legs and unwind.

I love how people who shop here are wearing amazing, trendy clothes.</review><Response>None</Response>< userid>

I love this flea market. It’s there every Sunday and there’s always so much to choose from. I saw Heidi Klum there with her daughter last time I went! Definitely check it out if you’re in the area. There is free valet parking here as well or street parking available. There’s always live music and food trucks here with delicious food!< /review>

New hand painted shirts through to vintage glass! Held at Fairfax High School grounds on Melrose, only on Sunday, the area this market takes up was very worthwhile taking the time to go and wander through, as it’s extensive. If you’re looking for an ‘Aladdin’s Cave’ treasure hunt market, this is it. Beautiful array of stock, a visual feast, well set up alleyways. Good food available, the restrooms are in the school building, and walkways are asphalt, some shaded, some sunny. also had a beaut little mini golf area kids can use for FREE, using fancy shoes as the bumpers.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTZ_dVhWAzAM93-bQyC_DVtZKipfW22CMte3_N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMECqg4uT3r53dbAq9KuNWTui11oVGw0f_oVuxB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3KTvgobsnn9Is6N4bfKdTLXvUROH4gughZnhx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnHgp2xZiLWoID0tbC_134eBEXo9yN87tqMqvD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVTCXsmaKJQZDtKc4oZlwPF5NjdbChEqodyIcD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObEyqrOnRpdCWS4XMsY-OOQCVrZgDJFR6-7j9-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-DbFKL9msccynH9SlgZdIPcA3nNCD3XQf8Ani=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOz7dd-C-43gsYmHlkWdtDaTnMJpOllv-AD4b2I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3-HB_UKgCQ-j5bDSoYVkolU9E_jiWq1QZ0HEY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrrvpBoVFA_i5qfI5os_IQk77uqNL9irFc3t_p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPobxhhyXxfboRiF8Wfzkl2VWQIF5QzsJgXhZ9J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2beccfa5466f5:0x5f3fd735a7af1c9e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is the place to go to in downtown when you don't know exactly what you want to eat or when you're with a lot of people and you can't decide where to eat. This place is packed with flavor from different parts of the world. I was able to see Thai food, Chinese food, Salvadorian food, Mexican food, Italian food, and even vegan food (yes, I know vegan food isn't a part of the world but it deserves recognition as a food category haha). There are also little markets inside that sell produce, meat, spices, and candies. This place has it all!< /Review>

This place is massive! It's also a bit of a maze so I would suggest getting a map. Don't come here if you are looking to get valuable items for super cheap prices. This isn't junkers laying stuff on tarps (which I happen to love also). The sellers here know what's for sale and prices are similar to antique stores or Etsy.< /Text>

Not as good as it used to be even though it is bigger now. The set up seems to have no rhyme or reason now and not a lot of cool stuff like before. LACC is just as good if not better now and is a lot less to get in to.<//Text>

We love the Melrose Trading Post, it opens every Sunday on Fairfax, supporting the local High School.

There are so many vendors filled with creatives who’ve come together to bring you affordable one of a kind pieces from; furniture to antiques, to jewelry, clothes, a shiatsu massage, crystals, vinyl records, dream catchers, plants... etc

There is a lovely square of food trucks and a live band.

Great place to go with friends, family, or with people visiting!</Text>

<Text>I didn't know this place before until my daughter who is Miss Jr Teen Hollywood was there to sell some cookies in order to help some non proffit organizations. This place remind me of my home town Tlacolula plaza because there are a lot of different vendors so you can enjoy different kind of foods and flavors. You can also rest under a big tree with a big shade there. The cost for the entry is $5.00 each person. If one day you are there, I hope you search for the girls, Miss Hollywood and help them to help the program "No Kids Go Hungry." They sell water and sodas too.</Text>< Name>

<Review>What can I say,  I love the Melrose market!!!!  So many awesome vendors: clothes,  accessories,  home goods, plants, art,  vintage,  repurposed,  new,  local,  global, you name it! I've bought handmade jewelry,  rugs,  candles,  homemade beauty products etc.
We also always go to the food area and get crepes and lemonade.  They have so many choices though.  Live music as well.  The best Sunday hangout.  Entry is now $5, I seem to recall. Might want to bring cash, although most vendors do square now.</Review>< pics>

You can find an eclectic variety of wares here: vintage clothing, artisan and vintage jewelry, houseplants, antiques, local artists, new furniture from local craftsmen, food for all tastes and diets, knick-knacks galore, and even more items in between. Most vendors inside accept cash and cards, but be prepared for the cash-only entrance fee of $5. You’re guaranteed to find something you didn’t know you wanted every time you go.<//review>< Pics>

Lot of creative stuff, good place to see creative stuff,,,very innovative, I found many old items like ..camera , ornaments, plants, hand made ornaments,
Many of them can bring their kids to show how an old camera looks like, stuff to decorate home, made with wood, iron, fur etc.<//Text>

Very nice flea market. There is a great variety of goods on sale and you will be surprised by what you will find. Even if you dont buy anything just looking at all the wares is fun and worth the $5 dollar entrance fee.<//text>

This place is amazing. I could get lost in this market for days. Downside is that some things are just overly priced but worth perusing.< /review>

This is a relatively fun, but small flea. It carries a $5 entry, but once you're in you're greeted with mostly vintage clothes, a few succulents and/or house plants vendors, some vintage print places, local Jewelers, vintage furniture, and a pretty great coffee place. It's more of a quirky outdoor home decor shop with a cover fee, but it does have its gems. Go here for clothing, or home decor. Don't come here for bargain hunting and lots of treasure hunting.< /review>

Non-profit partnership between Greenway Arts Alliance and Fairfax High School to bring a flourishing community market, professional theatre and arts education/life programming to the Melrose & Fairfax neighborhood.
Awesome local & independent businesses, artists, musicians, designers, collectors and makers fill the market every Sunday.
Your $3 admission fee directly benefits students at Fairfax High.
Art & local commerce uplifting the community = everyone wins< /Review>

I love hunting for treasures here. It gets pretty packed with “trendy” people who mostly shop for vintage clothes, which works great for me because it keeps the crowds concentrated at the clothing booths while I look for home decor. You’re able to find anything from antique pieces to modern handmade crafts. Most of the vendors are the same every week, but some change out and you’re able to find new things every time.< /text>

My first time at a flea market! There are two entrances ($3 each person). It's cash only, but if you don't have cash there is an ATM right by the entrance. Inside there are a lot of vintage items & stores that sell sunglasses, clothes, furniture, accessories, candles, food, & just some random items. Reminds me of an upscale outdoor swapmeet. It's only on Sunday's and it's just a fun spot to walk around! You may find a treasure or two!< /review>

Love the authentic italian food and choices, not to mention the cheap prices. You get your food like cafeteria style but it's so good and you can ask for small alterations in your order without the price going up. For example I wanted less noodles and more meat sauce. No bbn problem! They only accept cash is the only bad thing.< /Review>

There is an entrance fee of $5 per person but its totally worth it. This has to be one of the most trendiest flea market I have ever been to. They so much great and unique vendors. I was finally able to find the perfect camo jacket Ive been looking for, for lower than store price. The boyfriend and I got some healing gem stones for 2 for $15 and so on.

<text>If you check the website, there's usually a coupon for $1 off entry.

Early bird def gets the worm here.  If you arrive early there's parking, but if you are like most of LA you aren't gonna get any parking, good luck with that!

As my friend says, it's like an outdoor goodwill, so you don't get the musty smells.  Are you spending an arm and leg on stuff you can get for a few dollars at Goodwill?  Probably!  But the goods are always unique and there are also almost always celebrities if that's your thing.

There is always awesome music in the food area.  And the food isn't bad either!  The guy in the corner doing corn bowls is awesome with delicious kombucha on tap.  Other notable eateries include the crepe place and there are always samples of fries.< /text>< pics>

Not exactly my style per say... very vintage.
The music, food and drinks were great ! Very nice set up too. The plants (for purchase) were BEAUTIFUL. Extremely hot inside here though because of all the tents. Also, I think the entrance fee of $5 was a little silly.< /review>

I luv this smallish swap..The vendors are very nice for the most  part...Another reason I come is the CVT soft serve truck by the entrance. Jammin' soft serve.

Then I drive down the Street to Little Johns toffee @Farmers Market...the Carmel apples r to die for.<//Review>

<text>This flea market never gets old. I love spending my Sundays here. The food is great and sitting and listening to the music is nice. Always something to purchase and prices are better now then when I used to go a couple years back. I would say you can clear about 2-3 hours of the day here. Even though it’s $5 now I still think it’s a good deal. They do have $1 coupons online so check it out. Also, you may bump into your favorite celebrity or musician because there always some wondering around.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

First time here. It's awesome! Traffic is bad and parking is worse. And there was a line to get in. But that's all expected so if you aren't up for that, you chose the wrong place. Inside though, there are great vendors. Everyone was very friendly and tasty food stuffs!
Here's a photo of something that made me smile.</Review>

The Melrose Trading Post is a weekly (Sundays) flea market type of outing, and it features many eclectic and trendy artisan and collectibles-type of vendors. I went here for the fragrances by RxCandles, a great producer of fine scents for personal and home use in aromatherapy.<//Review>

This is such a fun activity. Great shopping, a treasure trove with something for everyone, even the people watchers. It relaxed atmosphere is perfect if you just want to lose yourself in mindless activity for a few hours.</review>

<name>David Glatt</name><time>1550543704695<//time><rating>5</rating><review>5 dollars to get in. Some booths are, to be honest, just people looking to get rid of junk they found at a thrift store. Some people sell vintage clothes (also probably thrifted) that could probably be cool but they’re a little hard to look through. The cooler vendors in my opinion were the ones selling handmade and refurbished furniture, some sold handmade jewelry, and the plant vendors were fairly priced. A good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This place is a complete dive.  You can get everything there cheaper elsewhere.  If you buy there you're getting ripped. Super bored, disengaged unfriendly people.  $5 just to get in and look.  $5 just to look!? Zero atmosphere. Went to The Grove right after - it's free to look, straight away you're 5 bucks up.  It's also absolutely beautiful, not a grim dust ball; far better experience, product and prices.  Many other better things to do than get scammed at this dive market.</Review>

<review>Fun, and I thought there was a lot of variety in vendors. Vintage clothes intermingled with artist Renditions of old and new ideas. I found some great antique jewelry reasonably priced. A few seamstresses out there making some unique athletic wear as well as club attire. There is a cover charge to get in... I think it is worth it as I'm sure it decreases the vendors lease fee and not everybody sells what they'd like.</review>< Rating>

<rate>4<//rate><review>This is a great "flea" market.  There are some that are mostly trash, but not this one.  It is well known and has great vendors of used, new and a mix of both.  Really good food vendors too.  Have only been a couple of times, but had good shoping experiences.  Have also had good breakfast burritos and even good live music.  Not only is it a shopping experience, but full family entertainment too.  Will always,go out of our way to check it out whenever in town.< /review>< Pics>

This little alley is suuuuuuuuuper cool. You want some odds and ends that can't be found other places (this is it) Such a good stop.

Music
Vintage Gear
Food trucks
Art
Shoes and more

This is what you expect in this part of town. Just a cool little stop for any age.<//review>

They have the best selection of vintage jeans and Poke Bowls in LA. I play music here every second Sunday of the month at the corner stage. It’s so cool to see how big the market has grown in the last couple of years!<//Review>

Its a street market showcasing local artistry and people's vintage finds. What other would call junk could also be another person's treasure. No shortage of old clothes and ornaments. There's a vendor there that has a whole department store section for aloha shirts for 7.00. Great fit for summer or for a gift for your trendy teen. It's bigger than you think so take the time to explore. Also, say hi to all the dogs you'll see. Came around 1:20, didn't find parking until 2:00 so I suggest coming early. There's also a mini street market across the street. It's a great Instagram photo spot due to the fact that there's an angel wing mural at the entrance of it. Great place to visit for 2 or so hours.< /review>

Really great way to spend an afternoon. Really interesting items that I've never seen before. Im an antique junkie  and love places like this. Quite large. Expect to spend a couple hours but not a couple bucks...most things were way out of my price range.<//text>

Of the flea market offerings in LA, this is a big one.  However, the dominant item is clothes, clothes, clothes.  If you are looking for curated/vintage home goods or local artists, artisans, etc, this swap meet does have some, but they are few in number compared to the clothing offerings.  It's mainly a younger crowd, so whatever used-clothing trend is happening at the moment for that audience, you'll find a lot of here.< /Review>

It was cute! Being from out of town, it's always hard visiting a flea market with so many extraordinary finds. Cassette tapes, vintage clothing, handmade furniture...the items are endless. Do yourself a favor and pop in. The live music is excusite!<//Text>

A fun place to spend an afternoon, but less useful for making purchases. From my perspective, the household goods weren't very varied, well-priced or high quality, but may just not be my style. Great people watching and food trucks though and admission is only $3 per person. I'd really like to give this spot 3.5 stars.

Also, uncomfortable restroom experience - guests can use bathrooms in the high-school, but the doors are so low that people standing in line waiting for the rest rooms can see you over your stall. Not sure how this isn't a problem for high-school students...<//review>

Love this outdoor flea market. Great unique finds!
However, lately I’ve noticed the vendor’s prices increasing and merchandise is becoming a little too expensive which completely contradicts that of an  traditional flea market or swap meet.</review>

Wonderful market full of antiques, new and unique items for the home, to wear, or to add to your collection. Food and music are great, too. For $5 (for adults, children get in free) you can spend a great Sunday there.< /Text>

Ah I've been here so many times I can never get bored of this place. There is so much to see and so much to do. Plan to spend a good 3 hours walking around checking everything out. I love the coffee at the food truck in the middle of the market. Remember to bring cash for the door to get in.<//review>

<Review>5 bucks to get in and it's worth it. Tons of variety of things, but mostly clothes. People are interesting and there is live music of varying degrees of quality. I also saw some people going crazy over some "famous" people there, but I didn't know who they were.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I see this as an over rated market. Clothes, furniture and food - all were below average. The only good thing is to enjoy the music and songs played by the musicians. Also, few plant shops are wonderful. Also, the entrance fee varies depending upon your arrival time.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>After arriving in 1997 & moving into the neighborhood it became one of my regular weekend destinations . Super cool then as now! A Melrose tradition! I love the early morning crush to get in... vendors & patrons. My most fond memories of the flea market are attending with all of my old friends. Remembering 20 years of sleepy mornings rolling down to the post. #oldschool #vintagestuff #ravers Thank You.<//review>< Pics>

<review>You have to come here! First off, the $3 admission ticket goes to the high school to help pay for programs that get cut (arts, physical fitness, etc). And then plan to stay AT LEAST four hours here. It’s amazing. So many different type of booths from grunge and cheap to chic and pricey. I stumbled upon this going up Melrose on a Sunday and I’m so glad I did! One of my favorite activities during my trip to LA.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

< Review>
Paid the $5 entry fee, walked amongst the snobs and well privileged fuctards for a couple hours.. I mean, the vendors were cool and easy to talk to, I even bought a skateboard, but the crowd of Spice-Girl Wanna-be's and people walking with their noses in the air who are too good to smile back at you - yeah, I'll pass next time and find us a fun Swap Meet to visit.< /Review>

Much nicer than the flea markets at home, makes for a nice day.  Like any flea market there will be things youre not interested in aeeing or buying, but looking around with patience may yield some results<//Review>

The hot spot for LA’s urban dwellers every Sunday, Fairfax High School parking lot is filled to the max of hipsters and kiosks ready to upscale your wardrobe or you interior decorating. Entry fee is under $5 and you can literally spend a whole day here checking out the shops, some live music and a delicious snow cone. Every trip to the Flea Market I walk away with new hand crafted jewelry or a groovy pair of sunglasses. Do yourself a favor and brave the parking to come wander around the asphalt, it will not disappoint.< /Text>

Paid the $5 entry fee, walked amongst the snobs and well privileged fuctards for a couple hours.. I mean, the vendors were cool and easy to talk to, I even bought a skateboard, but the crowd of Spice-Girl Wanna-be's and people walking with their noses in the air who are too good to smile back at you - yeah, I'll pass next time and find us a fun Swap Meet to visit.</Review>

Big flea market, Melrose = pricey but there are lots of vendors packed full of one of a kind goodies for you to take home and wow your friends and family. Lots of shopping in walkable distance so plan to make a day of it.</review>

Decent place, although I thought it was antiques for sale. It was a huge combination of goods for sale and people walking around smoking all over. Prices were a little high too.< /text>

<Review>This place is crazy, no offense, but when you hear that assume an offensive comment follows. It's a giant thrift store outdoors, most of it and I mean most, is used clothing. So if your into the whole BoHo seen, head right over.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2beccfa5466f5:0x5f3fd735a7af1c9e<//gmapID><date>1525661319896<//date>< Pics>

You could literally get the same stuff at your local thrift store for a fraction of the price there, plus $5 to get in, yeah that's crazy.<//Review>

Get there early before the crowds. Very trendy and fun. If you're looking for "deals" you can probably find cheaper (but you'll have to work harder for them).< /text>

Not a good flea market basically a place for hipsters to come meet for coffee on the weekend not a good place to find anything really cool vintage wise don't recommend it go to the Pasadena City College one that's much better</Review>

The lady at the front taking "mandatory donations" is extremely rude! Also most items at this "flee market" are extremely over priced...you can buy brand new at regular retail stores for cheaper or same prices.</review>

$5 entrance fee to a large and spreading flea market. Cash only, but they usually have an ATM nearby. Most shops within the flea market will take card however.</Text>

Bring a map. You're getting lost. This place this is giant and you'll never be able to find what you're looking for but you'll find everything you aren't.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Admission fee $ 5 / Stamp your back
Food truck meals, small shows, clothes, flower pots, accessories, antiques, furniture, shoes, photos, picture frames, cameras, and candles.
From looking good new products to garbage
From something you want to be a little expensive to selling at a reasonable price
There are many kinds of things, so it's fun to watch them and the time goes by quite a bit, but I personally have nothing to buy ^^;

(Original)
입장료 5불 / 손등에 도장찍어주고 입장
푸드트럭같은 식사, 작은 공연, 옷, 화분, 악세서리, 골동품, 가구, 신발, 사진, 액자, 카메라, 캔들 정말 다양한 종류를 한 데서 팔고 있었습니다.
괜찮아보이는 새제품부터 쓰레기가 아닌가 싶은 것까지
조금 비싸다 싶은 것부터 꽤 저렴하게 파는것까지
여러 종류의 것들이 있다보니 구경만해도 재미도 있고 시간이 꽤 금방 지나갑니다만 개인적으로 전딱히살건없더라고요^^;<//Text>

(Translated by Google) You don't have to buy anything, but after paying $ 5, you can watch every corner and listen to live performances.

(Original)
딱히 살 건 없다지만 5불 내고 구석구석 살펴본 뒤 라이브 연주 들으며 푸드코트 이용하는 것만으로 좋다.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) One of the best popular markets in Los Angeles and worth a visit, the prices are very reasonable and the merchandise is very unique and there is music on stage in the food side. Overall the place is worth a try.

It opens only on Sunday, the entrance fee to the place is $ 5. Most places require cash to pay, but there are withdrawal machines with an additional fee.

(Original)
من أفضل الأسواق الشعبية في لوس أنجلس و يستحق الزيارة، الأسعار مناسبة جدا و البضاعة جدا فريدة و يوجد موسيقى على المسرح في جهة المأكولات. بشكل عام المكان يستحق التجربة.

يفتح فقط يوم الأحد، رسوم الدخول الى المكان ب٥ دولار. أغلب الأماكن تتطلب كاش للدفع، و لكن تتواجد مكاين سحب مع رسوم إضافية.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) A large flea market held every weekend at high school.
It costs $ 5 per person to enter.
It can be purchased for less than half the price of used clothing stores in Japan.
They also sold miscellaneous goods, accessories, antiques, used clothes and furniture.
There are many stylish people so you can enjoy just entering.

(Original)
毎週末高校で行われる大型フリーマーケット。
入場に一人5ドルかかります。
日本の古着屋のだいたい半分以下の値段で購入できます。
雑貨、アクセサリー、骨董品、古着、家具まで売っていました。
お洒落な人がたくさんいるので入るだけでも楽しめます。< /text>

(Translated by Google) There are many cute shops that are smaller than Rosebowl's flea market! Compared to rosebowl, there are more accessory stores, so this is recommended for those who want a necklace.
You can enjoy a variety of food trucks and live performances.

(Original)
Rosebowlのフリマより小さいけどかわいい店が多い！rosebowlと比較するとアクセサリー店が多めなのでネックレスとか欲しい人はこっちがオススメ。

(Translated by Google) The Flea market is located in Fairfax High School, on Elle's famous Mallory Street. Admission is $ 5, free valet parking. It's always crowded with young people and tourists living near Hollywood. If you come to Los Angeles, the center of world entertainment, I recommend you to stop by.

(Original)
엘에이 유명한 맬로즈거리,Fairfax high school에서 열리고 있는 Flea market으로 볼거리 먹거리 살거리가 많은 곳입니다. 입장료가 5불이고, free valet parking입니다. Hollywood근처에 사는 젊은이들과 관광객으로 항상 붐비죠. 세계 Entertainment 의 중심지인 Los Angeles 에 오시면, 꼭 들르셔야 하는 곳우로 추천 드립니다.</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is a nice antique fair, there are also some artisan exhibitors. Approx 200 stalls there are also food shops and when I went there was a girl singing live with her guitar. It is done every Sunday and admission is $ 2. I parked one block away on the street at no charge. You can haggle or ask for a better price. There are very nice articles. Worth a visit.

Es una linda feria de antigüedades, también hay algunos expositores artesanales. Aprox 200 puestos también hay negocios de comidas y cuando yo fui había una chica cantando en vivo con su guitarra.

(Translated by Google) Quite wide this swapmeet offers a lot of variety. You find quite a few things depends on your taste.
Also When you visit this place do not forget to take a little tour of the food stalls. Many choices and everything tasty, especially the Mexican food from Alberto I love when I go I do not hesitate to stop by for some tamales or a dish that they prepare. Delicious.
