Super friendly service, large portions, decent foods and prices. The owner grew much of the herbs and even made her own bean sprouts. A bonus I was given 3 Opo from her prolific garden ( gourd shaped Asian squash, can be saute or put in soup, taste like zucchini ). If in the neighborhood I'll stop by again. I had flame broiled pork with vermicelli noodles ( a good go to favorite ), my traveling companions had phở ( beef noodles soup ). B+< /Review>

Got hella food drunk off the pho,  glad we have a place in town that makes pho.  I didnt go to Young Sing before because there was something to be desired that was missing, glad they found the missing link.  Pho makes you feel less stuffy and better especially with some real dashes of sriracha.</review>

<Text>This place has the best pho. The flavor of the broth is superb ( I eat a lot of pho all over America, and this is one of my favorites). It is better than happy garden and panda express im tellin you by far. Dont waste your time with those other restaurants. Life is short, so make a wise decision and eat here. Its the best chinese/ vietnamese cuisine in Susanville. The orange chicken and the chicken pho are my favorite so far. I come here often and they are really friendly and have great customer service.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Would give 5 stars but since now under new ownership I am wanting to eat there a few times before the upgrade. So far very pleased; the flood is good, decent portions, they have done well continuing this fine establishment. Only issue.is, with the summer heat, the fans are all on high and it cools the food quickly: might need some tweaking. Otherwise very good. Staff is friendly and prompt.</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>If you give this place more than one star than you've never had decent Chinese food before. More veggies than meat in the entrees. Felt kind of ripped off on $60+ bill. More like Vietnamese food than Chinese food. It was my son's birthday and he was disappointed. Friendly service though and clean.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x809d96256bcc5415:0x6d4375719c25502a</gmapID></record>

Been eating here most of my life.  9 out of 10 meals are amazing!  Every once in a while (cook must be off that day) I get a mediocre meal.  However, the service and friendliness makes up for any so so meals.  Great place, great people, and great food.</Review>

Surprisingly good, and unexpected for Susanville - coming from the SF Bay Area, every time I get food there is amazes me that out here, in the middle of "nowhere", I can get Chinese food that is both authentically done, and delicious.  It's become my "Chinese take-out" place when on the road...  Add to that, the people working there - every one I've met, anyway - were friendly, cordial, and seemed to be having a good time.< /Text>

Sadly have to change my review. No clue what happen, but the last several times we have gone the food is horrible and WAY too expensive: 45.00 for 2 noodles and 2 sweet and sour chicken.</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very good food. A large portion in a variant for two. Not expensive and tasty. I recommend.

(Original)
Bardzo dobre jedzenie. Duża porcja w wariancie dla dwóch osób. Nie drogo i smacznie. Polecam.</Text></record></dataset><record>

First off, this may not seem like a fair REVIEW because, I was given their name from a competitor.

As I recall a salesman that I had dealt with for years told me they didn't have what I wanted. He referred me to the company listed above.
He said, they were honest, maybe slightly more in costs but great service.
I purchased a refrigerator and freezer many years ago and am extremely happy with the outcome.

The owner recommended that I purchase a larger freezer but I did not take his recommendation and regret that decision since. Our dryer broke down after many years and I decided to purchase another one instead of repairing it.
It's a HEAVY DUTY model similar to the ones used at the laundry mat.
We purchased a model similar to the one that broke down.
The service provided has been perfect so far and we don't expect any different in the future.<//text>

<review>Purchased GE Double Oven from Manuel Joseph appliance. The oven never worked from the first day. The bottom oven would not turn on. GE  technician came out to repair the brand new oven.  He had to order parts for a brand new oven. Totally dissatisfied with GE products. It’s been three weeks and the oven is still not repaired.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

We have called GE to add you to a priority wait list in the event that an earlier service call becomes available.\n\nI'm truly sorry you didn't get the service from us on the phone that you needed.

I bought a GE refrigerator 1 1/2 yrs ago from Manuel Joseph Appliance Center.  I try to do business locally, so even though I pay a bit more than I would have at Sears or Home Depot,  I thought I would get better service.
Boy was I wrong!!!  Refrigerator stopped working after 1 year and a half, and guess what.  The warranty is only good for one year and the person that answered the phone wasn't the least bit sympathetic to the fact that it is 100 degrees out and the fridge is cooling and I am losing $100 worth of food.  Back to Sears for me.< /Text>

My daughter's car was disabled on the freeway when a piece of metal debris punctured her gas tank.  These guys were great, working with AAA to fix the car, and get it returned to us in another town in California!  We could not have asked for better help!  They are AAA quality!< /text>

<text>I have been taking my 2 vehicles here now for about 2 years since moving here and was recommended due to Great service and M. always tells you exactly what is wrong with your vehicle and offers very fair pricing. Certified licensed and insured I never think twice about this business. Very capable mechanics have done brakes, alternator and cooling system work for my 2 fords. I will be returning next time something happens to my fords cause let’s face it they are fords.</text><rate>5< /rate><Resp>None<//Resp>< time>

<review>Good prices/ base rate. Good owner/ mechanic friendly and helpful. Let's you bring in your own oil for oil change. Some of the best prices and quality of work you could ever expect. Location is convenient near 92. Very accommodating to your time and price needs.<//review><gmapID>0x808f96965304fc65:0x5b6f0b0f1ec73623</gmapID><time>1517941861579<//time><Rate>5<//Rate>< user>

Update:  Continue to get excellent service at Bo's Imports--great organization, fair pricing, takes the time to explain the problem and offer solutions and options.  Another fantastic experience at Bo's!!

Review from 9 months ago (May 2017):  Professional outfit.  Clean, well run office.  Bo knows everything -- or will find someone who does. Good communication, reasonable prices, great service.<//Review>

<text>I took my car to get a smog check & everyone was very nice! It took the amount of time they said it would (less than 30 minutes) and the price was great. My stepdad told me to expect to pay anywhere from 60 to 80 dollars and it ended up being 66. I know my car needs other work so I’ll definitely be coming back to Bo’s Imports :)</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I found Bo's Imports on my phone while my car's engine light came on, and I am sure glad that I did. I feel very welcomed in the shop. They are quick and give fair prices. They will explain clearly what is needed to be done with your car and what can wait for the next service. Great place with great people!</review>

Cannot beat the service Bo's Imports has given us because they are all very professional to deal with. My husband and I are completely satisfied with excellent service Bo's Imports has shown us. We are very satisfied customer and will come back again and again to service our cars in the future.
Thanks to all!<//Review>

Highly recommend Bo's Imports - for any car...
I have two cars, one a Suzuki Samuri, the other a Chevy Trailblazer - both cars love the extra care received by Bo and his team - I'm grateful that my friend Jeff shared Bo with me.....it's a place I've come to trust, knowing that what is recommended is what is needed as preventative measures to insure my cars continue to operate - the Suzuki is 30 years old....still purrs...
When in doubt ...take it to Bo - you will be treated well!!!</Review>

My 2012 Golf developed mysterious electronic gremlins and Bo and his shop took on this nightmare and my car is running great now. They're super friendly and super professional. At all times Bo kept me up to date on what was happening and why, so there were never any surprises. He even let me borrow his 2000 Outback while my car was out of commission! Where else can you get that kind of friendly relationship? I hope I don't HAVE to come back too soon, but I will be very glad to come back when I need to.<//Text>

<Name>Martin Redmond< /Name><Text>Brought my car to Bo's to get a second opinion after another autoshop I'd been going to for years told me I need to get rid of my car or replace the engine (which would cost thousands of dollars). Bo quickly assessed the car and made various recommendations including a tune-up, oil change and other preventive maintenance along with a fix or two.  It wasn't cheap,but my car is running well, and I certainly didn't  need to sell it or get the engine replace.  Been taking my car to Bo ever since.  He's proactive, his services are fairly priced and he aims to please!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1451353753626</Time>< rating>

<Review>All I can say and continue to say is that these guys offer the best customer service in town! I had a great first experience when I brought my Nissan Murano in to get checked out. I was having a few electrical problems with my car, but once I got my car inspected I was back on the road in no time! I always get a little iffy about going into auto shops, but man did these guys completely change my mind! Such a wonderful experience and I will be returning in the near future!

Updated review: 02/11/2019 -

I booked an appointment yesterday with Carlos for car inspection. I felt good about bringing my car to these guys! I've heard great reviews and I've brought my car in the past. I'm looking forward to them fixing up my baby and getting me back on the road! Shout out to Parvai for updating me on what my car needs! Thank you everyone!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808f96965304fc65:0x5b6f0b0f1ec73623</gmap_id></record>

I needed a smog certification today!
I called Bo's Shop. It was okay to come in 10 min it will take 15minutes. Sure enough - Bo's delivered "My car is smog certified". .. Prancing with glee to DMV.
Excellent customer service!!!

P.S. Bo is charming as well!<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Been battling with what was the cause of my 2005 Volkswagen's problems.  I met Ben from Bo's Imports, after some talking I brought it in.  They were able to look into it, and found the actual problem.  I had previously brought it in three times to another service garage which basically had me throwing parts at this, which were not a root cause of the problem.  Thanks to Bo and the team, we find the problem to be a major component, and repair was done.  Now, I can say the car drives like new, and I have confidence in it, being reliable again.  I would highly suggest if you have a Volkswagen or Audi with the 1.8T engine, and it is having problems, have Bo's Imports diagnose it.

Thanks!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

The service was top notch!  I conveniently made an appointment online for an engine notification warning, which has been on for about a month.  There were other things about the car that didn't feel right like the erratic coolant temperature gauge and the inability to start the car on certain days.  Instead of giving up and donating the car to charity, I decided to repair and keep it as my main commuter car.  Thankfully, I brought it to Bo's Imports.  They are very professional and trustworthy, keeping me informed about the services performed along the way, so no surprises in the end.  They went above and beyond, especially when they scoured the interior of my car to find a special wheel lug nut that I was missing.  I can't think of any improvements that is needed.<//review>

Food was okay. Gave this place a try because of the reviews so I checked it out. Ordered the following items

-Pollo Saltado
-Tallarín verde con bistec
-Salchipapas

Thought it was gonna taste better. Not saying the food wasn’t good but flavor wise things could improve with these dishes.

Also, I ordered chicha morada but the flavor was more cinnamon than any other flavor. I used to go to a spot down that street called El Virrey. Now that was a good hole in the wall place. Feel like this is too overrated.< /Text>

One of the best Peruvian Restaurants I have tried in Los Angeles after living here for 14 years. Has everything you could ever want regarding Peruvian Cuisine. Thank you to Ruben for being a great host and waiter and enticing us to come back in the future. I will definitely be bringing some of my friends here soon to try out one of my new favorite restaurants!<//review>< Gmap_id>

Hands down the best Peruvian restaurant in Los Angeles, I thought I wasn’t a fan of Peruvian food (mostly because the only place I had eaten my Peruvian food was Rocoto) until I tried this restaurant. I am excited to go back and try more items from their menu! The food is beyond delicious, it turned me a Peruvian food skeptic into a Peruvian food lover! and the restaurant is cozy!! I recommend trying their fried shrimp appetizer<//review>

El Pollo Inka and El Rocoto may have new competition.

Perú Chicha is, in my opinion, currently the best Peruvian place I've tried in the area. They truly captured the best of Peruvian dishes and the atmosphere is stellar! Gives me nostalgia of being back in Perú. The service is friendly and the urban Peruvian music matches its atmosphere.

All of this aside, bear in mind this place is small compared to other restaurants, and has a maximum occupancy of 13 people, but they are definitely worth the wait!

I can't wait to come back here again!<//text>

Pollo Inka has been one of my favorite restaurants for the last 20 years,  having said that, I have to say that I had never tried authentic Peruvian cuisine.  The atmosphere at this tiny but friendly place is tremendous.  I enjoyed the food, the service and the personal attention.  Great fresh food,  I recommend it.</Text>

It was a good ceviche served there.  A little bit different in flavor compared to other peruvians places where I'd had that delicacy before...they don't serve alcohol in case you're wondering...Enjoy...<//review>

Fantastic service, very friendly staff was helpful and gave good suggestions. My wife got Lomo Saltado and I got Bistek a Lo Pobre. The seasoning of the meat was fantastic. The meal tasted great and was very filling. We had lucuma ice cream for dessert which was delicious as well. Definitely recommend.</Review>

I did not regret going and taste the delicious Peruvian food, I recommend it from the service to the taste of the dishes they are very good! I recommend it 100%. The cost is average to what they cost in other restaurants! But it is worth it!

<review>(Translated by Google) I asked for a combined chifa noodle and they gave me only chicken, but they charged me as a combination which is 3dol more expensive, I didn't realize it until I got home, and the salchipapa was the most disappointing, very little for the price, they charged me 9.95 and the restaurant's menu says 6.99, in the inka express they serve better, the noodle was good, the chicha, better taste than the inka chicken, but I don't think I will consume again in this restaurant, the first impression is what account for me, and I did not like their service with the noodle, charging me extra for something they did not give me.

(Original)
Pedi un tallarin chifa combinado y me dieron solo de pollo,pero me cobraron como combinado el cual es 3dol mas caro,no me di cuenta hasta que llegué a casa,y la salchipapa fue lo mas decepcionante,muy poco para el precio,me cobraron 9.95 y la carta del restaurant dice 6.99,en el inka express sirven mejor,el tallarin estaba bien,igual la chicha,mejor gusto que la del pollo inka,pero no creo que vuelva a consumir en este restaurant,la primera impresion es la que cuenta para mi,y no me gustó su servicio con el tallarin,cobrarme extra por algo que no me dieron.<//review>< name>

(Translated by Google) Peru chicha a small place. But creative, place full of nostalgia combined with its good seasoning, an unforgettable experience. That mix of flavors, friendly attention, warm place that transports you to Peru with just a taste of any of its dishes.

(Original)
Peru chicha un lugar pequeño. Pero creativo, lugar lleno de nostalgia combinado con su buena sazón, una experiencia inolvidable. Esa mezcla de sabores, amigable atención, lugar calido que te transporta a Perú con tan solo una probada de cualquiera de sus platos.< /text>

<Review>Well I have to say I watched a video of some first amendment guys in there and I thought the blonde haired lady in there was very professional and polite to them,I'm from and live in Scotland and can honestly say I don't think they would have been  addressed as politely here . so well done.< /Review>< pictures>

Then she walked me through the process to include a notarized request form and other pertinent personal information to ensure I’m the person who requested the DD214.
I loved the work ethics of the country folk let alone public workers.
Public workers in Bakersfield rock. Thank you.</Review></record>

<Review>The first time I've been to the beautifully restored old Hall of Records building with its incredible interior glass ceiling dome.  I didn't have a clue what to do.  The lovely receptionist, Rebecca, offered to help. She must have spent 20 minutes with me, expertly guiding me through a morass of incomprehensible document navigation until I found what I needed.  I expected my experience would be like the notorious DMV, but it was the complete opposite.  Kern County has knocked it out of the park with their Hall of Records!.<//Review>< pictures>

I went in this morning, was charged $100 for  a simple transfer deed. I had my 3 year old son and was frankly, just trying to get it done. She told me it would be $100 which I thought was excessive, but didn't question it until much later when I made it home. I looked up the $75 fee and SHOULD NOT have been charged it, since I am the owner/occupier of the house. I Called and they just told me "oh we don't tell you about exemptions you should have a lawyer" I told her I absolutely DID have a lawyer do that for me, and she stated it was their responsibility. Ridiculous that the employee could have just asked me if I was occupying the home, and told me to fill out another sheet of paper and couldn't or wouldn't be bothered. Since when it is a lawyers responsibility, as they are the one charging the fees for the service?  I did look at the website before hand and did not see that anywhere. A shame, the world be a much better place if we could all just be a little kinder and help one another.</review>

Called to get property owner info on a real estate.  She had enough guts to tell me to send in a check for $2(two!) in order to obtain the information.

What a degrading bunch of people running the show!  Very rude and unfriendly.<//review>

<Review>I dogsit in the neighborhood every once in a while and always make a point to come to Ruby’s during my stay. The people who work here are super friendly and the food and coffee are fantastic. The sandwiches are tasty and substantial. My favorite order is half a Ruby’s Veggie with chips. Bagels and pastries are good too! In non-plague times, it’s also a fun and relaxing place to get some work done. Definitely worth a visit.< /Review></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>We went here on a Friday afternoon for a quick bite.  They have a lot of sandwich options as well as other items.  We got the fresh mozzarella sandwich and it was a refreshing sandwich.  I also got a Flornetine cookie.  Big open space with plenty of seating available.

This place is also dog friendly!  Staff was nice, friendly and quick with our order.

Great place for a excellent soups and sandwiches, typical cafe fare. Awesome selection of pastries and rotating themed sugar cookies. The owner is a total gem and such a sweetheart. I have been coming here for years and the whole crew knows us and we enjoy coming here often. They don't have a kids menu but it doesn't matter, it's still my 3 young kids' favorite place to go. Highly recommend to everyone!</Review>

<Review>My son and I had some business to attend to here in Emeryville. I needed a place to feed him. I walked into Ruby's Cafe with no expectations. I bought a drink and sat down at a table. The atmosphere is cozy, the employees are all very nice. I fed my 9 month son (there are no highchairs in here) the bottle of milk then moved onto solids.

I asked where the napkins and one of the workers,  (manager? Shift supervisor? Owner? He was dressed differently) Albert, offered me a towel to wipe my sons face as i had left my wet wipes in the car.

Very friendly place, Albert checked on my son and i a few times and made sure we were comfortable even though i had just bought a $3 drink the care and attention we received was incredible. Colton even walked out with a toddler sized T-Shirt from this place.

Next time we are in Emeryville we will definitely visit again. This place is awesome and you should give them your business.

Attached is a picture of my son, taken in park across the street :)< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Food was ok but they gave me a paper straw for my beverage... paper. With the prices they charge I couldn't even get an actual plastic straw. That's just insulting.</Review>

Great Fresh Sandwiches. My go to is the Black Forest Ham Combo with a Green Salad. The green salad is pretty good - spring mix with walnuts and a raspberry vinaigrette. Service is quick, fast and friendly.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Food was DELICIOUS, staff were polite and genuine. I almost didn't go in because the line seemed long and I had limited time on my lunch break. But the staff moved the line along quickly and made my sandwich quickly. Miss Vickie's chips and Izze drinks, can't beat it.

Glad I discovered this place, will be returning.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Not many choices for food in area. Only complaint is pricing. $4.25 for a bagel? I understand the rent has to be high in the neighborhood but... I will probably be back but I also frequent airports so I'm used to pocket abuse.< /Text>< Pics>

Had the Mediterranean/hummus wrap for lunch. There was too much liquid dressing and since the pita was dry, the wrap fell apart on me while I was eating it. Next time will try their pastries/coffee instead.</Review>

Very fresh-looking produce. Food booths were few, but most likely due to CV. There overall size is probably on the smaller size, but again, probably due to CV. Some booths require you to line up so they bag the items for you one customer at a time. Others have each individually packaged in plastic.</review>

Very small but quaint farmers market. Love going here for the organic veggies.  Sorry, but I brought my dog here and I didn't see the sign, no dogs allowed. But nobody said anything, I think becuz they were either scared or wanted to pet her!!! LOL
I will always come here to support local farmers and businesses.</Review>

There have been empty stalls the few times I've been there. They're missing some craft people I think. I go mainly for produce so it's not really an issue for me. The sellers are very helpful-busy but helpful. Some sellers offer samples at a couple of fruit stands. And there is most always some music being played. Great place to bring the kids and then head over to Fernandez park down the street.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>The pinole garden club rocked it again this year. They really provide a wide variety of plants and succulents. Everything we put in the ground last year is looking fantastic. I am on the fence about posting this but it word has already got out that this is the place to buy. Great job ladies!!! I look forward to next year!!!!</Review><Time>1525548084292<//Time><userid>105873144016961198733< /userid>< username>

<Text>This Farmer's Market, although smaller than the usual ones we go to, has most of what one would need.
The produce is fresh and reasonably priced.
There are bakeries with goodies for the sweet tooths in the family.
There are also plants for sale.
For those who do not want to cook once home, there are booths with hot food prepared to order.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< Review>
I walked in, wasn't greeted and the lady charging was the same one cooking. She seemed bothered to help and to be there. I ordered 2 pupusas revueltas and they were ok.  They tasted good, not amazing, just good but it was mainly masa and almost no filling and they were also pretty small compared to other places.  I wouldn't recommend.  If you really want to try their pupusas, go on a Monday or Wednesday when they have the pupusas on sale for $1.50.</Review>

<review>Nothing really special about this place. One star because the arroz con frijoles order was small and tasted bland (like it was refrigerated). There are other pupuserias in the area that are cheaper and tastier.</review>< pictures>

The pupusas revueltas are all maiz and no filling.  Not worth the price!  They are small and super thin. I have tried many other pupuseria restaurants and this is by far-The worst.  I had take out  from this place and it just wasn't worth my gas and time to request a full refund.  Thumbs down for me!!</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The chicken tamales are no longer the same now they don't taste the collection has no flavor and the chicken is as if they had been taken out of the soup and put directly into the dough, they don't work, they are not like they used to be.

(Original)
Los tamales de pollo ya no son igual ahora no tienen gusto el recaudo no tiene sabor y el pollo es como si lo huvieran sacado de la sopa y puesto directo a la masa, no sirven, no son como antes los hacian.</text>< username>

Came in before they opened. I was first in line and the staff explained everything to me in detail. Clean waiting room across the parking lot. Make sure to print the coupon. For something we are required to do, they made it painless.<//Text>

Raul was so pleasant to work with. I was running late and missed my appointment, but he was able to reschedule me for later in the day. I also forgot my DMV paperwork, but he was super patient with me while I scrounged around in my glove compartment to find my old registration. I was able to use a coupon from the website for $20 off, and I was in and out in 15 minutes. Very satisfied, I'll definitely come back for future smog tests.</review>

Showed up for an appointment on time and was helped as soon as I got there. Took 20 minutes from start to finish. Good, quick service. Will be going here for all my future smog needs. (And yes, everyone was wearing a mask)</review>

<text>If you need a smog test this is the place to go. I had a 2 appointment and he was right on time!! He gave me a discount that really helped.  Place is a little hard to find but not impossible and his waiting room should be avoided as it is very dirty. As far as his work is it was spot on!!</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Hard to really rate a smog check service. Every time I take my car in, they give it a passing report. Is that good? Or is that bad? I'll assume that the car is actually not polluting more than current standards allow and call it "good".
They successfully upload the pass result to the DMV systems so that I can complete the registration the next day, so that's good.
The "waiting area" is kinda iffy. Thankfully they've never made me wait there for too long.
The guy handling intakes was polite and efficient.
All in all, a good enough smog check service, I think.< /Review>

Normally this place let's you drop in and get a smog but due to COVID you have to make an appointment.  I didnt know this and the guy was kinda rude about saying, but he had been repeating himself all day I'm sure. But in our defense none of knew and they didnt let their customers know. So be patient!</Review>

First off, with the coupon I had handy, I got my smog & certificate for $38 even ('04 civic) so that was pretty sweet.

Second, I rolled up at 11:40, no appointment, and was finished before noon.  Absurdly fast (admittedly there wasn't anybody else being serviced at the time, but even so, it was quick)

Third, the tech who took care of my car was quite friendly & polite.  Greeted with a smile, made sure I had all my paperwork in order, & was just all around pleasant.

Even without the coupon the price would have been better than a number of the other shops around, so that was really just an added bonus.

I'll be coming back when I need my next smog check, and have already pointed a few friends this way as well.</Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>I just found out about these guys and wished I had known about them sooner! This smog shop has a sibling office down the road that also offers DMV services (for a fee). It is a family run shop that employs competent and courteous technicians and managers. All you have to do is show up with your paperwork and if you need to register or file any other paperwork just go down the street to the registration office and they take good care of you! HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

One of the best! Very fast, very friendly service, I was in and out of there in less than 20 minutes. If you make an appointment, they knock off $10 for you and if you can upload the coupon, its an extra $20 off. You can't find a better deal than that!< /review>

I'm very wary to recommend this shop to anyone. They said my car failed the visual inspection after passing the state tests with no issues. I saw no issues before, during, or after the test. The tech further stated that he "doesn't do anything without getting paid" when I asked for a retest. Just a heads up when selecting this place among all the other local shops.</Text>

I have been to the Santa Rosa and Petaluma shops and have never had a bad experience! I had an older car and was told over the phone it would be a little more expensive because another test is required- with my Val-pak coupon it was still under $50!

I have had 5 cars tested at 101 smog and bringing #6 tomorrow :)<//review>

<text>Repeat customer from 2 years ago, had a great experience in 2011 and today. Had originally been referred by a friend. Two young guys working had to make a business successful; price was right and they accommodated my schedule. Was concerned that my truck might not pass since my OBDII scanner couldn't connect to the OBDII port, was told they'd check before they ran the test. If they couldn't connect they wouldn't run the test.

The only knock is they only have 3 chairs in the waiting room (2 additional chairs are broken) but you're also not paying auto dealer prices. Keep up the good work guys and
thanks for your help today.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

{'time': 1462304660361, 'text': "Just for the record. In the great state of California, all vehicles that are subject to undergo a smog test and that have non-standard parts fitted (that are part of the emission system) require an Executive Order (EO) number to be visible on the part at the time of test. Sadly, your vehicle had no such part number. This was clearly explained to you at the time.\nWe do not make the rules, we are obliged to carry them out however unpopular or inconvenient you may find this. If we are subject to a bar inspection and are remiss in our duties, we get a big citation and fine.\n\nIf you believe we are in error, you should contact the BAR Referee and put your case before them.\n\nVisit www.asktheref.org or call (800) 622-7733 to learn more details about the BAR Referee Program, find a Referee station, or to schedule an appointment.\n\nRegarding our company policy of NO CHECKS, every clipboard where you sign the work orders front and back have a notice in red. The distance from the signature box to this NO CHECKS is approximately one inch. There is also a NO CHECKS sign again in red stuck to the window some six inches from where you attempted to pay by check.\n\nThrowing your card at my technician will not carry favor, neither will the verbal tirade directed at him. In actual fact the father of your company's president was kind enough to apologize for your unreasonable behavior.\n\nThe final question that springs to mind, was that if your vehicle passed at other smog stations, why dig you come to ours?"}< /Resp>

<resp>{'time': 1471885344109, 'text': 'Good Morning Jack,\n\nThank you for bringing this to my attention. You are correct, walk-ins are very welcome however an appointment will usually be more expeditious when we are busy.\n\nI apologize most sincerely and unreservedly that you were asked to wait outside. The mitigating circumstances are that on Mondays & Thursdays our machines are required to be calibrated, however I realize that this did not apply to the machine used for your vehicle.\n\nI have spoken to my staff on the subject on the brusque manner with which you were allegedly treated and this issue has been addressed. Once again on behalf of us all please accept our apologies.\n\nAll the very best, Adrian...'}<//resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>I went there this morning. I did not make an appointment as the website said; walk ins welcome. I  was treated like I was stupid, and made to wait outside (until a guy let me inside who was not affiliated with 101). It was fast, but the two shop guys attitudes were terse and condescending</Review></record>

{'time': 1497490526929, 'text': 'Just for clarification purposes, you made an appointment for your 19 year old son at 1:00pm to bring the 1999 Honda Accord in, and were quoted a discounted price by our technician at the time the appointment was made.\n\nYour son arrived at approximately 10:45am, he did not mention the booking or the discounted price and was happy to pay the published wall price. This fact was confirmed to our technician on the telephone when you phoned up to fire a tirade of abuse at him. When you asked your son, if he indeed had notified us of either the booking, or the discount, he quite clearly said and I quote "NO!" At this point, you then chose to entertain our technician with your obscene language directed at your son, and then redirected it at our technician.\n\nAfter you finished abusing my staff through what must either be your own incompetence, I am stunned that you have the temerity to go on a public forum and vent.\n\nIt is painfully obvious by the your son\'s admission that he didn\'t notify us that, and that we are neither mind readers or psychics. Had you had approached the situation in a more contrite manner, I would have probably refunded the difference. Seeing as you could not contain your passion, I am inclined to not refund the difference and maybe in the future, you might communicate to your grown man of a son that he should come at the appointed time, identify himself that an appointment was made and that you had a discounted price quoted. This would prevent ridiculous exchanges on here.'}< /Resp>

I made an appointment for noon, showed up on time and only spent about 20 minutes there total from pull in to pull out. Staff seemed friendly but it's a couple of younger guys running a smog check station not a fine dining restaurant so I don't know what other people who left bad reviews about that were expecting.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>113276292695203000273<//user_id></record>

{'time': 1530812072363, 'text': 'I’m very sorry for the inconvenience. The reason you could not have been dealt with promptly is, we only had one technician working until 10am and he was smog testing one car & busy calibrating one of our testing machines. This test is required twice a week by BAR. Usually we have two technicians and a service writer in attendance.\nWe have no way of screening calls. Once again I apologize for being unable to deal with your call in a timely manner.'}< /resp>

We love this little park
It's clean. Lots of seating. Shade and grass areas. Street parking only. Not a ton of traffic.</review>

<Review>Mosaic park is one of the many parks in San Ramon that caters to the needs of the residents of the area. It's lush green lawn, children's play area, a community centre where residents meet to celebrate public festivals and private functions, are noteworthy. It also has an open swimming pool which is widely used by people of all age groups. You will also find in the evenings groups of elderly meeting together to spend time.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Fun big place to go to. A little busy sometimes, but overall great place. I did a Nerf war here, and for the bulk of the time, I didn't get to go on the playground, because little kids were there. Greatly recommended for parents of little kids, but not recommended for adults doing professional, competitive games.</Review>

<Review>This pool has been a great place for kids for many years. However rules are not being well regulated recently. Even basic rules, such as no alcohol, no glass container, no loud music, etc., should be common sense to all. I'm surprised to see how often these rules are neglected. The worst of all was a group of people, playing loud music from bluetooth speaker, drinking glass of wine in a kiddie pool!!! These violators should be banned! To people who check this review before coming to the pool, please respect rules to keep our community pool safe and fun place for everybody.<//Review>< Rating>

I absolutely love this place !!! i used to go here every week after school and still do whenever i’m in the mood for sushi. The cashier is extremely nice and the place just feels welcoming. The food there is really amazing too ! I usually don’t wait to long to get my order so that’s nice and being able to order through the phone is a great relief. I’ll definitely keep coming back again, I love it here ☺️<//review>

The chicken teriyaki was good. Unfortunately they put old cabbage in it. The wait time was around 30 min. I don't think the wait was worth it.< /Review>

Its tasty and priced right. Wash your car while you wait for your order to be ready. Convenient. Lines do get long but order through phone and its usually ready by time you get there. Its about a 15min wait. Brought to you by REALTOR Tomas</review>

Best sushi in the area. Fresh and good prices. They have a teriyaki chicken family meal for a good price as well. They take phone order which take at least 40 min to be ready specially on the weekend. If you are in the area give it a try it won't disappoint.</review>

Thought it would be ok to sit for a couple minutes since I seen a couple workers sitting eating they're lunch, but I was immediately scalded by the head chef for sitting on one of they're chairs.

My kids love it but I found it a little unorganized. I don't think they are doing what is needed for people to keep their distance. I didn't see the workers disinfecting or letting people know not to stand so close, no markers. Maybe I missed them it but I didn't see a sign that said no mask no service. I had my mask and my disinfectant. I wouldn't go back but I'm sure my kids will. Their california rolls are very tasty but didn't care for their noodles. I guess you as a consumer have to check it out yourself.<//text>

I love this place! They provide high quality dishes, their menu is large, The chief cook in that restaurant is a specialist, I enjoy very much tasting all their food. The dishes are consistently of high qualtity, the service towards the clients  is very good too. I frequently visit this restaurant and I was never unhappy. I recommend it with no hesitation.< /text>

Dont try to get food here as a walk-in customer as they rather prioritize to serve over the phone orders. I had to wait over 45mins to get my order. By the time I received my food the steak was cold. Sushi is served with too much rice making the rolls bland, no taste.<//review>

I decided to try this place one day out of the blue and have been a return customer since, they have a great selection of rolls baked, sahimi, and regular. If you don't like sushi they even have plates that please beef or chicken eaters. The service is friendly and you always get what you ordered. Very great place.<//text>

Pandemic Review: I called previously for takeout the girl answered set the phone to the side and took orders waited for 5 minutes before i hung up. Came in person and there's 10 people some waiting out in their car and 1 left. They are slow they need 2 people at least at the front. Can't order online and 5hey are busy enough that they need it. They are still letting you get your own drinks , not enough space for 6 feet social distancing. Food is still good but overall with the times they need to up the standards.

B4Pan Review:
The food was good with medium portions. Really popular place. But it was warm inside which would account for the flies at the windows. Bathroom is located outside, and not alot of parking they have some good specials.<//review>

I celebrated my PhD earlier this evening in this great restaurant. Well it was a cool evening and the place was evidently the reason for the successful event. The crew  cooperated in a pleasant manner, the meals were appetizing and my guests were so  happy. We shall surely return for more joyful events. thanks very much.<//Review>

The sushi rolls are awesome!!
The appetizers are good but need some work
The teriyaki chicken is delicious!
The restaurant is kind of small and has limited seating
Not many options to drink, no alcohol/sake/etc.
The restroom is in the back and theres only 1 for both women and men, must lock it when in use and after finish using
The wait times for your food are normal, not fast or slow and they let you know how long the wait will be if you order a baked dish
The staff is always polite and never seem grumpy even though...
They get very busy at times since the food is so good for the price

The only real cons are more about the setting and not the food. Limited Seating, Busy Parking lot (carwash on same lot) and Small restaurant with separate bathroom.

I use to go from sushi spot to sushi spot trying each out and being disappointed in the taste vs the price but here the sushi is great for the price. I now come here at least once a week.<//Text>

This place was my go to place for sushi, but lately it hasn't been good. I've gotten sushi that taste kind of old. Missing items. The food is good. But idk they need to step up their game.</Review>

My best friend took me here one day and that's all it took for me to love this place. The people are nice and the food is delicious. I recommend their crunch roll. It's really good. Four stars because the place is clean but small....if it were bigger it would be nice.< /review>

The sushi here is pretty good!! And prices are awesome. I have a spot that is sort of far but once I found this sushi spot I have been getting it more than usual.. this one is down the street from my house so convenient. I've only tried the sushi, place is decent, very friendly aswell. You can never go wrong for some sushi during happy hour  Staff is very friendly, and easy to talk to. While the California rolls are great, Dragon rolls, and Tiger rolls are my favorite item, the Teriyaki bowls are the way to go! Leaving me satisfied every time to grab lunch there. :) I havnt had any luck finding a good sushi joint in this area. Finally gave this place a shot and regret not driving the extra miles before. The parking isn't the greatest but the food is great and the prices aren't all that bad<//text>

This place is really good. I only get sushi here which sometimes the raw sushi doesn't taste fresh. It's still good but can be better. Overall a great spot.< /Text>

First time tasting the Shrimp Tempura Roll. It was delicious. Also, when I came in it was quite which was a huge plus for me and the food was at a reasonable price. Great customer service as well. Would try again.</Text>

<Text>The Orange chicken sucks ,the smallest pieces I
Of chicken and the flavor isn't good at all waste of money and the amount of chicken is very sad. I would of rather spend my money on the $1 or McDonalds or jacks to be honest I spent $21 On number 10 and 8 never going back I just moved to the area and decided to try it out because I don't cook on Saturdays VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</Text>< gmap_id>

< review>
Convenient spot not the greatest but better than other sushi places around the area. If I'm doing local sushi I'm going here. The fresh rae fish sushi are the best. Everything is ok except the shrimp tempura. its not crunchy enough kind of soggy like it's precooked and used later instead of made fresh. The teriyaki I never get so I dont know.</review>

<review>This is great location to enjoy Japanese or at least, "inspired" Japanese food. The only downside, is it's location and if there's traffic from afar it can be quite easy to unintentionally miss it. However, with that exception and in general, it's a great place for food and the prices are reasonable.< /review>< Pics>

Asked for plain salmon with avocado without any sauce and they easily complied. Other places seem to lose brain cells over special orders. Great tasting too.< /text>

Tasty food, friendly staff. Rolls can use more rice vinegar for my personal taste and parking can sometimes be a pain. One of my go tos for rolls without the inconvenience of going to little Tokyo.<//text>

They basically give you cold food. I just moved to the neighborhood from Venice, I've never had cold food from a fast food restaurant. Quite frankly, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, unless of course you're totally fine with reheating your food in the microwave.< /review>

If I could, I would eat here everyday. The sushi is great and good priced. Their teriyaki sauce is one of the best I've tasted in LA. Absolutely love this place.< /Text>

Customer service is okay, the food is served pretty quick. Chicken teriyaki is above average they serve it with the usual macaroni and salad except on a paper plate, the salad is horrible its basically thick chopped slices of iceberg lettuce. The macaroni is mediocre, Sushi isn't all that great at least the two I ordered. I feel like it's very overrated.</text>

<text>Really bad service, the boss has a ugly  attitude and he treats bad his workers,
Last time I went I saw him screaming and treating bad the cashier in front of the costumers, i think it was her first time working there, I never saw her before but I didn't like how he treat her, I hope she's ok.....even though I'm not going back there.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I did not like when I arrived with a friend she went to ask for work there, and the cashier behaved very despot saying that they did not request personnel, since the sign said that it was requested, and my friend asked to speak with the supervisor, and he alone He asked him to write down his name, phone number, and experience, and he never called him.
