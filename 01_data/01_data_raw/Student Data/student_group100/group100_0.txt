They make you order pictures without even seeing them. I got told to plan better to make sure my kids cloths match better to their background--but you don't know what the background looks like. They only allow you 2 days to look at background and if you have issues, too bad. Not their problem. They don't care if you have serious conflicts (for example, father in hospice and you spent time with them instead of looking for an email you didn't know you were going to receive) they said 'not their problem I should plan better'.
Anyone that uncaring and cold should be out of business. They don't care about anything but money. HORRIBLE people.<//Text>

< Review>
Both of my boys took school pictures. We get the proofs and they are full body and off-centered. You can’t crop the photos on the website. I don’t want a picture that’s majority backdrop. I want a picture of my child. Unfortunate too because their faces were some of the best smiles they’ve had! Disappointing.</Review>

<review>I was really happy with them!  I volunteered at picture day and the photographers took their time, fixed collars and even fixed hair for students.  When we got our pictures, there were no issues and we even received a cute birthday card.  Overall happy with everything.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I would give them no stars if there was an option. I reordered my son’s kindergarten school picture back in March. It is now July and still have not received that photo. I have contacted excel photography multiple times and it just went to voicemail. I have now gone to that point where I had to dispute the charges with my credit card company. So glad I was able to get my money back from my credit card company. You can have your $27, excel photographers! I’m better off just taking my son’s school photos at a more professional place. Such a hassle dealing with an unreliable company!< /review>< pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>My kindergartner CLEARLY had food on her face. She’s only 5 and obviously needs a few gentle reminders from time to time, as do all children. I understand there are Many students to photograph however, it would be 15-30 seconds to hand her a wipe and that’s the business you are in, if you are a school photographer. The whole thing is even more frustrating considering that we have to purchase packages in advance, with no recourse if the service they are provided falls short.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>I'd give a 0 but not a option. I had placed a order online last friday and called the office many times during business hours to cancel my orders and no one picks up the phone. Left 2 voice messages and no call back. Sent out a email, during business hours and still no response. Going to try and call this monday when they open to cancel and refund me.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Was not happy with my daughters pictures. They took them way too fast before she could even make a full smile on her face so we decided to do retakes when they came back to the school a second time. Paid in advanced and when i got the pictures back ( which took a month) my daughters glasses were so crooked on her that her frame was going across the top of her left eye/ eyelid. I have been calling but they never answer. Hoping her school will pick a different company next year. The backgrounds are ugly. Not tasteful at all. Very unhappy with the outcome.</Review>< Pics>

Terrible.  Wish schools would picks a better photog company. But its either pay for POOR QUALITY  or dont have any school photos. Catch 22. Tried to order just the digital download and it kept double charging me for 1 item. (Digital pic is $14. I am ordering 1. Website is trying to charge me $28) Even my 1st grader can tell you that isnt right.</text>

They took the photos of my girl's school in Fairfield ca 2019 it took me a month to deliver my package and it was not for what I paid they gave me some wallet photos so I called them they never attended ... Money lost ... Very sad because  I arranged my very beautiful girl for her photos and for them not being professionals I didn't have my photos.</Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>Picture day was Oct. 6, 2016.
My son came out very adorable and I loved it. This was his first school picture. I do feel they can improve on the editing. I felt like the color was off just a bit. My son has light brown hair and he looked like a strawberry brunette. But still adorable. I felt that they were a bit over priced compared to my Lifetouch photography. My older son goes to a different school so I get to see comparison in price. The last thing was how long it took me to receive the portrait CD and the class picture was a few months later to receive and I did get the class picture in 2017. It was a very long wait. But despite the 3 problems I have had I still loved my sons pictures. Please review everyone's reviews and consider improvements. We are the ones who purchase and keep them. Also for the website please make it easier to use. I figured it out but it could be easier.

I am disappointed at the fact that my daughter’s school is contracted with these people. The backgrounds are beyond tacky and you have to wait over a month or more to receive your pictures. I would give them 0 stars because their customer service is garbage. I hate Excel photographer. I would NEVER recommend them.<//Text>

Not only did I get overcharged, the pictures are horrible. It looks like it was copied and pasted to the background by a child. I am not happy and I will not take anymore school pictures if they are the photographers.</review>

After reading soo many bad reviews I only purchased the digital download and I'm glad I didn't waste more money on their packages. Excel does not use a studio backdrop, or proper lighting. Appears as if only a camera flash was used. The problem with this is the backgrounds are clearer then the child's actual image! Overall the photo looks like a mediocre attempt at cut and paste photoshop. The digital download file is only half 1 megabit, 500kb!!! Not even large enough to print an 8x10. Lifetouch's file size is over 3mb. To top it all off I just received an email promo 30% off black Friday sale. I didn't get her class photo, so thought I'd take advantage. However the prices are now marked up! 30% off is actually around 6% off their normal prices. Which were a total rip off. I can take better quality photos with my cellphone camera.<//text>

<Review>Where do I start....my daughter's had pictures Friday morning at their school so I woke up super early to curl there hair.The girls then told me the photographer used a comb to push the hair back which was NOT necessary because my daughter's hair was pulled back so to top it off the photographer used the SAME comb on all the kids  !!! Gross...and so God help me if my daughter's have an outbreak of lice there will be hell to pay  !!!! Never again will my daughter's be getting pictures done with this company!!!!< /Review>< pictures>

The staff is amazing and has been very informative and helpful for all of our situations. The community is a beautiful setting and there is everything that you need literally a walk away. We love the place.

HOWEVER, some of the neighbors are completely inconsiderate and just loud with no limits. By no limits, I mean blasting music and loud conversations or even arguements late at night. It's ridiculous. They have absolutely no respect for others and don't consider how others have to wake up for work hours before sunrise.<//text>

<Review>We absolutely loved living here! We rented a 2 bed/2 bath unit in 2018 and enjoyed each month. Staff were friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable and helpful. A lot of improvements have been made and had we not relocated to Northern California, we absolutely would have renewed our lease. Perfect for pets and families - great sense of community here.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Just visiting the complex but the exterior customization is pretty cool to see. Great pool, manicured greenery, and the tenants are allowed to display some lights, flags, porch art, etc. Most places nowadays have owners with a huge disconnect and outdated policies with regards to that kind of freedom. Would definitely like to live here in the future!< /Text>< Pictures>

We recently moved here and I LOVE it!! The move in was so simple and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Karissa was awesome she helped us with everything and when we asked to move our move in date up a couple of days it was no problem. The layouts of the apartments are spacious and having an attached garage really makes it feel like a home. I would recommend this community to anyone especially if you have kids as its very kid friendly! Shopping, banks and restaurants are all close by too which is a plus. Needless to say I am very happy that we found this place and will enjoy living here!< /review>

<review>I've been a resident at this complex for a couple of years now. I find the amenities to be outstanding. The management team at this complex go out of  there way to accommodate and help you when needed. Karissa and Janelle are the go to girls in the office and they have always treated me with the utmost respect and enthusiasm. Always smiles from these two young ladies. Alex the manager also is a true professional at what he does. I would recommend this apartment complex to anyone. They have monthly events that helps in getting to know your neighbors. These events are family friendly and lots of fun.</review>< Time>

Rent goes up steadily,  a couple hundred dollars after the 1st year! Nice exterior set up but has gradually declined in service, over all appearance and service (especially pool area), and difficult to get help with repairs and other community issues from front office. The complex has increasingly declined in both appearance and safety,  with a string of crimes over the past 2 years,  including a recent stabbing of a male resident! I have also heard that this complex is now a section 8 residence!<//text>

I've been living here for 2 years now with my fiancé and two kids. We're thinking about doing another year here as we love everything about it. Alex the manager in the front office is amazing along with his staff. Louie the maintenance man is always on point and fixes things promptly when needed. We've never had any problems with bugs or anything. The property is kept very clean. Everything is local and at hands reach.<//Review>

I just renewed my lease for the second time. Living at Terraza Del Sol has been the best experience. The apartments are so nice. Besides having our own attached garage, we get our own washer and dryer along with all appliances included. Karrisa, Janelle, and Alex work in the office and are always in a great mood and so helpful with any questions I have. The maintenance and grounds are always clean. They have a CARES Team that throw monthly events so that neighbors can get to know each other. I feel safe with Terraza Del Sol being a gated community. My neighbors have become friends and there is no better feeling than feeling comfortable where I live.<//text>

< review>
My Daughter moved into Terraza Del Sol in November and with every visit I fell in love. The floorplans are very spacious and the apartment grounds are always kept clean. Terraza Del Sol does not feel like an apartment, but more like a home. There are no issues with parking. I love that there is no one living above or beneath you. The leasing agents, Henry and Judy are very friendly and approachable. I'm very happy to call Terraza Del Sol my new home!< /review>

Terraza Del Sol Apartment Homes are very nice quality Apartment Homes. They are in a great neighborhood, around shopping centers, food restaurant, and also entertainment for the family. Local schools, and great weather as well. The Apartment Homes are nice, and your living quarters are worth what you pay for. The pool is beautiful, and the gym is what you need, if you just need to tone up.< /Text>

I would recommend this to anyone single or who has a family. This is a very nice community with a spectacular staff. Ive never lived in a community where it literally felt like a family environment. They keep the community clean and always maintained. Ive had very few calls to maintenance because these apartments are well kept. If you ever have any issues they are quick to get them fixed for you. I know there are other residence that will 100% agree with me. Definitely is the best bang for your buck in Rancho Cucamonga!< /Text>

You know when I moved into Terraza Del Sol Apartments it was so unexpected that the management was able to make it possible in just a short time. With the two women working in the office they make you feel good and that everything is OK, and they stay on top of things so nothing gets all confusing. And the maintenance people are good and know what they are doing. Just like an everyday job you have chains of command and as long as you follow their rules and follow procedures everything goes smooth. Now the most important thing i am really going to brag about is the security. I feel we all are a strong community everyone knows everyone and we look out for each other. And if you see something or have a problem with anything they have a community feature to talk with and last but not least its cheap here which give you you other additions you can add to your rent such as extra garage  or personal space etc...<//review>

<Review>Moved in to Terraza del Sol over a week ago and office and maintenance staff have been amazing!  Very attentive and diligent with all our cares and needs.  Communication with them is superb and practical.  When they say they will take care of something they get it done!

The apt is super clean inside and out and also secure.  Grounds are impeccable and parking is well controlled which contributes to the quality and cleanliness of the property.  Recommend this complex to anyone looking for a place in Cucamonga.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Bad and inconsiderate  neighbors.  No respect regarding parking rules and noise.  They will park in front of your garage if it is a parking space.   Managers are nonresponsive to tenant concerns.  Charges $100.00 for extra parking space.  Must get a parking permit for visitors and guests. Newer building, but not better.  No privacy...your patio is across from other tenants if you live above your garage.  A tiny one-car garage for certain units.  Laundry room is in one car garage and you must carry clothes up and down stairs for each load.  Neighborhood was ok during my tenancy.<//text>

Very Beautiful Apartments. Very peaceful. Surrounded by lots of great restraunts. Grocerie stores near by. Walking distance. Only thing that sucks is no visitor parking. Cars will be towed.  You can't even enjoy a birthday party here because of the parking. Your guest will be towed at your expence or theirs!<//text>

They give discounted rent for 5 star google reviews, notice how the yelp reviews tell a completely different story from reviewers since they offer no discounts for those reviews. Homeless camps are a problem here in the field in back of the apartments. Have seen police arrest men for living inside of garages they have broken into. Management is horrible at fixing problems. I have taken this property to small claims court and won over $2,000 due to their gross negligence and unprofessional behavior. There is a police car here at least once a month. The landscaping is immaculate but besides that it's all looks and no substance. A dangerous place to live.< /Review>

I have lived here for close to two years and I can honestly say things have gotten a lot better, I have once rated this place a one star due to a lot of staff issues and lack of follow through however the staff is way better and professional - the team follows through with better parking enforcement. Everything isn't perfect but I can honestly say its been great living here - A well deserved 5 stars!< /review>

Te place started off to be a gem, but then the two ladies working got fired and we got left with the manager. and it sucked!  Luckily w only had a few months left on our lease. We had a good deposit in the apartment we left the apartment clean, in the first walk through of the apartment they sen tone of the newer ladies to "check" our apt. she said we left it very good, carpets good and that all that was needed was  standard cleaning and washing. We just got the notice and they charged us for CARPET REPLACEMENT! they took our deposit and on top owe $700+ i have yet to call the management company., but i can bet anything that there was no excessive stains. we started to wash our carpets and she herself told us no its ok that doesn't need heave duty cleaning and they are going to charge you anyways. Now what to do? avoid a headache and don't move in the manager Alex acts like he cares about your problems but unreality he is the one who screws you over the most in the end, as he is the one who signed off on our " bill"</Text>

<text>After one month of living at Terraza Del Sol, so far it has been a great exprerience. Love the fact that you have an attached garage along with a washer and a dryer, and all the  appliances!!! SWEET!!! The apartments are so beautiful-interior and exterior. It's a very safe and quiet complex. The neighbors are very friendly. They have a CARES Team that throws monthly events so that neighbors can get to know each other, which is a very nice thing to do.  You also have very friendly staff in the leasing office.   Janelle and Karrisa are always in a positive mood and very helpfulI. They made our move in  easy and quick.Terraza Del Sol Apartments is a great place to live!  I would recommend this place to anyone! :-)<//text><name>Cecilia Perez< /name><GmapID>0x808566f8d886d70d:0x7d6527991489bc14<//GmapID>< Pictures>

I use to like this place, I’ve even been inside the restaurant, but I just ordered on line, and they forgot to give me some rice, it was totally cold, I even said I would pay for some pickled turnips, and didn’t get not one on my order. Won’t be going there anymore.< /Text>

<review>I used to love Lebanese Kitchen, so I'm happy to have found this place. The food was tasty and the prices reasonable. LK was nicer for dine-in eating, but that doesn't matter much now during COVID. The people were congenial, but one of them doesn't seem to get that his mask is supposed to cover his nose.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>We visited Shawerma Masters on a recent trip to LA, on the search for a great Shawerma sandwich (which in LA is very challenging)! We tried and loved the Shawerma, it was cooked with just the perfect amount of spices! The portion was very generous and best of all was the extremely friendly service! Prices were very reasonable to! I highly recommend this place for anyone who’s looking for that great Shawerma bite! You will not be disappointed 😉</text>< pictures>

Food was ok, nothing bad or great. I ordered online, and was given no pickup time. It took almost 55 mins for food to be ready, and the guy bagging up my food made a joke about having dirty hands. There are other similar restaurants nearby, I’ll go to one of them next time.</review>

I get that healthy food in LA is expensive but this place needs to put in a little more effort for the prices they are charging.

Meat was very dry.  Sides were very salty.

Go to Upick on Lake for higher quality food at a similar price.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

The beef Shawerma was juicy and tender, while the chicken s bit more on the dry side. I think they have the best baba ghanouj around!

<review>The chicken shawarma sandwich was delicious, but the only thing I got thrown off was that the description on the menu said there was fries inside, but mine did not come with any. My husband ordered the bowl, thinking it would come on rice, but instead it was just salad underneath! We wish the descriptions were more accurate but the food itself was not bad.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c336e01ac893:0x4af9852a5cb08094<//Gmap_id>< name>

<review>Lots of staff/ family hanging around doing nothing- don't be in a rush.
Shawerma wrap was ok flavor wise however it was very skimpy on 5he meat and fillings. The pita bread could have been fresher also.< /review>< pics>

Save your time and money, these people have the worst customer service in the industry, package to this date has not been delivered to my customer and sounds like the $7,000 pizza oven has been lost, Why am I not surprised after getting the run around for over 3 weeks.< /Text>

<Text>DO NOT SHIP WITH DAYLIGHT TRANSPORT. We shipped with them 1 time and our shipment showed up to our customer like this and they refuse to take responsibility. Shrink wrap completely removed, damaged product and boxes that clearly fell off and were re-stacked UPSIDE DOWN. We will never ship with this carrier again, we'll stick with CTI.< /Text>< Name>

<Text>This company claims to offer faster shipping at a premium price but then always seems to be delayed and deliver at most a day before the cheapest economy carrier. Save your money and just go with another carrier since the transit times they advertise are never real!!! 4-5 transit from Chicago when they say 2 days coast to coast. What joke. Freight will sit waiting to be unloaded at the terminal for two days< /Text><user_id>113527372866487127154<//user_id><response>None</response>< time>

Big Facility, nice break room, bathrooms are clean 90 % of the time. Waiting is perhaps the only issue here. But over all, it's a pick up and drop off that I don't mind coming too.</Review>

I've done ACLS and NPS courses at CalMed over the years and both experiences were great. The ACLS class was pre-COVID and it was fast and thorough. Mike and his staff are very efficient and knowledgeable in operating their classes. Post-COVID, they are still all of those things with cleanliness and safety to boot! Highly recommend.< /text>

The class is long as expected but Mike makes it not boring. He goes straight to the point but yet teaches you valuable information for what you are going to use in the hospital setting. I will definitely continue coming here to renew my certifications.<//text>

Cal Med has the best instructors, their classes are second to none. They are professional and organized on every level. Mike makes his classes easy to understand and fun considering the length of the some of the courses. Margie is the best BLS instructor and treats her students like family. Both Mike and Margie are personable and kind. I’ve taken ACLS, BLS, PALS, NRP, ECG, and 12 Lead. I cannot recommend them enough!!</Review>

I found this school just doing research online and in comparison to others, I liked the fact that you would be able to take the national exam immediately after the program and at the site.
This program was so intense and accelerated it does help when you do the online portion as they request of you. I am in the medical field as a phlebotomist, and learning about the heart and blood flow, the foundation of EKG and Monitor tech was an eye opener, but Mike, the instructor is sooo cool and so laid back and so freaking knowledgeable and his teaching method is so easy to understand that you can't help but to soak up everything he has to offer. I came from Lancaster, CA and stayed in a hotel just to come here and it paid off.
Mike is such a good guy and an even better teacher. He has so much patience and although the class was accelerated he didn't rush the material. If there was something you didn't understand he just looked at your face, even while wearing a mask lol, he would ask you did you understand that and if not, he made sure he went over it again. CalMed Training Center was a GREAT INVESTMENT. I WOULD DO ANOTHER CLASS IF I HAD TO. I AM 100 PERCENT PRO 3G CALMED TRAINING.
YOU ARE AWESOME MIKE

Attended a CPR/BLS Provider class in October.The instructor had the necessary equipment neatly set on the tales , was friendly, professional, and energetic. The class was concise, easy to follow along and certified immediately. I felt safe with all the necessary precautions (small class size, social distancing, and access to hand sanitizer on tables) I will be coming here for all of my certifications!  Thank you so much!< /review>

I just passed my EKG Technician test thanks to Mike and Calmed Training. I drove an hour and a half to come here and I am so glad I did.

Mike is very patient and knows what he is talking about! The course is accelerated so do yourself a favor and do all online training, practice tests on the NHA portal and study your terminology as they recommend. If you do what they tell you it's pretty likely you will pass.

I appreciate the time and effort they put into every person there. They are taking COVID precautions and I felt totally safe.

Thanks again!<//text>

Amazing staff, I have taken the IV class and the CPR class too. Great prices and they responded quickly to my emails when I had questions . Even though it’s about 45 minutes from where I live in Lancaster, I rather come here. I will be taking more classes soon.< /text>

Fantastic experience. I did my EKG certification course and they made it very stress free and fun. It's also a plus that it only takes three days and they have plenty of equipment to practice skills on. I'll definitely return for other certs.< /text>

I was impressed with my experience at CPR 3G. They  were recommended by a friend and the recommendation was deserved. The material was presented clearly and the instructor took time with everyone in the class to ensure understanding. Things moved along at a good pace and I was never bored. The price was less than I found at other places. There was easy and free parking. All in all I had a great experience. Sage is an awesome instructor.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Mike is a great teacher for me especially came from a different subject knowledge what I had, he displays evidence of his preparation for materials for the class are organized and adequate pacing on his teaching style due to a short program we need to complete.  He provides enrichment when he sees student needed his support. Because of all of his a great caring, kind and wanting all of us to do well on this program he went extra mile for students. This is an impressive quality that rare to find in today’s life. Trust me without his effort I would not think I would pass the national exam. Now, I have hope that I will have a better future what I had prior enter his program. Big thank YOU, wish you the best!!</text>< pics>

Having been a CNA for 2 years I was in search of something in the medical field that was different and challenging, that is when I reached out to California Medical Training Center.  The staff was quick to answer me back almost immediately and they were willing to answer any and all questions I had. I decided on sigingin up for the EKG Technician course, and I was not disappointed!! The instructor Mike was informative, innovated and enthusiastic, which made the class FUN!! He genuinely cares about his students and goes above and beyond to help them succeed! I'm proud to say that I completed the course and am now a Certified EKG Technician.  I will definitely be taking other classes here in the near future and I confidently recommend California Medical Training Center to others in search of something awesome!</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Outstanding and quality educational experience and training. If you are in Healthcare and need to update your certifications, THIS IS A GREAT PLACE to get your refreshers and on the spot CEU's.

If you want to be one certified and are getting into the health care system,  THIS IS THE PLACE.

California Medical Training uses a great concept of hybrid learning.  They use a pre-course  online syllabus, you get to take practice quizzes and practice test, which PREPARES YOU for the 1st day of class to the completion of class.

This concept makes you a success and helps you better understand the information which you have a great learning experience and gives you a high passing rate.

During the in class experience, the instructors are extremely passionate about their teaching and they are well versed on the latest trends in the course they teach.

They also use high quality videos, worksheets, and have the hands on equipment to cement the learning process and you, as a student, end up with really high scores.

Lastly, the instructors work with you on a 1 to 1 for clarification, explanations and demonstrations, before,  during and after class as well as via texts and emails.

Also, your certificates are READY at the end of the course or temporary certificates are provided until you get the official certificate from the issuing agency, depending on your course.

Overall I have taken 3 classes with California Medical Training and never have been disappointed. Also, the price for these classes are much more affordable and below the current rate as compared to other training programs.

These instructors have a vested interest in their students and in their success with their Healthcare Educational Goals.< /Text>< Pictures>

Great experience. David made the class light and entertaining. He was able to cater to everyone's level of ecg knowledge. He even took some time to explain some rhythms to a participant of the class who was not familiar with them.

I would gladly repeat the course with them again.<//Text>

I have been a long term client of CPR 3G, over 3 years.  I have taken BLS, ACLS, advanced IV insertion, ECG and pharmacology.  All the instructors have been excellent with a firm caring manner getting the class to the goal of learning the material.  I also thank you-all for providing this service in the San Fernando Valley so I don't have to go far to get this done!< /review>

I took his EKG course a couple of months ago and in that short period of time he thought me so many things.   It was challenging for me at first since I was transitioning from a different major which did not have any correlations with the health care system. However, he took his time to teach me step by step and made sure I was able to fully understand the course.  At the end of the course, I became Nationally Certified and left with a big smile on my face and ready to join the medical field. He left a great impression on me and I encourage others to join his courses as well.</Text>< pictures>

Took an ACLS class here last weekend. Plenty of parking which was great, no headaches about finding parking after our lunch break. The class was informative and fun. Justin, our instructor, made the class interesting also I didn’t feel stressed out like I usually do when we have to do megacode. It was great, I highly recommend them.<//Review>

Venue and class size is very conducive for learning. Excellent materials for audio-visual and book learners. High professionalism of instructors. I just did my IV therapy and Blood Withdrawal Training with them and I am coming back on January 2019 for ACLS Training and certification. More power to my instructor and thank you!</Review>

I took ACLS for the first time here the class was great, but during it, David the instructor, touched on some ECG Dysrhythmia Interpretation items that literally made a light-bulb go off in my head.  The way he explained it I feel FINALLY made me understand.  I don't write a lot of reviews, but wanted to share this one because I truly appreciated this.  Great job!</text>

I traveled from Florida to Los Angeles, California to take three specific courses from California Medical Training Center: trach/vent, ABG interpretation, and airway management/modes of oxygenation. The trip was well worth it!!! All three courses were fantastic. The knowledge I gained from these courses has helped me tremendously in my job. I work as a speech-language pathologist in a hospital, where most of my patients have a tracheostomy tube in place and/or require ventilatory support. I needed formal instruction from an experienced respiratory therapist in order to better serve my patients with voicing and swallowing difficulties.  I didn't feel that these patients deserved to be neglected just because of my incompetence. So I signed up for these courses and flew across the state! Justin was my instructor for all three courses and was an excellent teacher. He's got a wealth of hands-on clinical experience and is very personable!!!! Mike, the owner, was also incredibly helpful and informative! I appreciated the time he took to share his clinical knowledge and expertise on speaking valves for trach/vent patients.Two weeks ago, I was able to safely place my first in-line speaking valve on a spinal cord injury patient requiring vent support. Because of this in-line speaking valve placement/trial, the patient had the opportunity to have a conversation with their kids for the first time in multiple months. Thankfully, this patient has been tolerating the in-line speaking valve during my therapy sessions with them over the past few weeks. And when the alarms sounded during placement and tracheo-bronchial suctioning, I knew how to troubleshoot! I also have many other trach/vent patients that are being seen sooner during their hospital stay due to knowledge Justin shared with me during the three courses. Thanks so much to California Medical Training Center for providing me with a wealth of much-needed trach/vent/pulmonary knowledge to help  better serve my patients with a tracheostomy tube and/or ventilator.<//review>

Amazing Instructor Nava, David for ACLS.He was entertaining and kept the class laughing the whole time. I learned alot from this class. He is a "Paramedic" so he comes across what he is teaching you on daily basis almost. He made it really simple to understand.<//text>

I've been going here for years.  This is definitely the lowest stress BLS, ACLS, and PALS that I've ever taken.   I highly recommend them.  Even if you are the only person scheduled for a class, they will still have it for you.  They offer all the classes you need.  Check out their website.

11/2020 UPDATE
Even though there are COVID restrictions, Cal Med Training Center continues to give classes and does a wonderful job!  Instructors are great and make sure you understand.  I'll keep coming back!</Review>

Robert was extremely helpful with my mattress purchase from nectar. He matched the deal that I was going to get online. I couldn’t believe when he asked if I wanted it delivered the next day! The guys that took my old mattress and set up the new adjustable frame were friendly, on time and fast. The best experience buying a mattress ever.<//text>

We had a problem with the mattress that we purchased about 5 weeks ago and she asked me to send a picture .After picture she says yeah it looks like there's some sort of defect and I mean she made it easy. It really makes me want to refer everybody I know there that needs a better mattress or box spring because she made my experience really really easy. After the exchange of the mattress was settled I  ordered a box spring from her or from the company as well. And she had a lot to do with that because of her professionalism.

Keep up the good work< /review>< pics>

Phillip B. Provided a perfect and professional customers service to my wife and I. We informed him that we were looking to buy a mattress for our daughter. He was very knowledge-based and demonstrated the various types of mattress. We were able to purchase a mattress and decided the best choice based on his professional experience. I wish we can find this type of service everywhere. Thank you so much!<//text>

We were in there for a while going from one bed to another and really sinking in to the mattresses to see which one my hubby and I liked. We were given all the information and got great service from Robert! I can’t wait to get our Stearns and Foster on the adjustable base! 🙌🏼🙌🏼<//Text>

Excellent costumer service, Phillip, the sells rep., helped me out explaining and trying to find the best deal to get the best mattress. In addition, very clean space and at all the time complying with the current situation (COVID-19). Totally recommend it if you want to get the best mattress to help you sleep better.< /Review>

<Text>I had a great experience with the Mattress Firm location in Hayward, CA.  I spoke with the Sleep Expert & Assistant Store Manager, Jessica.  She walked me through the process over the phone, helped me chose a mattress, all while staying within my budget.  I was able to pick up the mattress the same day from the distribution center in Livermore quickly and easily.  I would highly suggest speaking with Jessica for all your mattress needs!</Text><UserId.>101776361156940964624< /UserId.><Name>Chris V< /Name><gmapID>0x808f913ef2358a59:0x76c2cf4d8e1ee886< /gmapID>< date>

<text>I recently bought a new mattress at the Hayward Mattress Firm and am so glad I went to this store.  I went there to check out their cheapest mattress but was encouraged to try out several options and I chose a much better mattress for my needs.  Philip Brown, the manager, was awesome--patient, helpful, knowledgeable, and professional--and he helped me get the best mattress for me and for the best price.  And I'm thankful that they deliver and set up your new mattress and adjustable base, and haul away your old mattress. Yeay!<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Great experience from start to finish! Me, my husband and my mom went in for new beds and Davon Bennett took great care of us. He was very knowledgeable and helped us narrow it down to the perfect beds for us. Davon made sure we got exactly what we wanted. Great customer service and great prices. You can’t go wrong!

This place has excellent customer service! Immanuel & Philip we’re the people that helped us find the mattress we needed. We came in looking for two beds, one for my girlfriend and one for her brother. They were friendly, patient, and knowledge. My girlfriend and her brother had different taste when it came to their feeling of mattresses and Immanuel knew exactly what beds to show them according to their liking. I definitely will be bringing the rest of our family members here if we need new beds!<//review>

< Review>
Philip and Davon were extremely great in helping me decide which mattress I wanted and not being pushy about my budget. The ladder was the best part because when you are looking to make an essential purchase such as a mattress but are trying to keep a fiscal budget they still take their time and effort to find what you need. Glad I came to this mattress firm because all my needs were filled and they made sure I didn’t leave the store until all my questions were answered.< /Review>

My husband and I had the best experience with Phillip. He took so much time with us to find the perfect mattress for our needs. He also helped us find the right base, mattress protectors and pillows, all at great prices. We appreciated that he wasn’t “pushy” and didn’t try to sell us on things we didn’t want. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience.< /review>

Today I went into Mattress Firm and Philip helped us out. He was great. He made sure we got what we wanted and kept it in our budget. He took his time and had us try different mattresses. I didn’t feel rushed nor any pressure to buy but we walked out of there with the mattresses we wanted.</Text>

When I went in, I met Phil. He answered all my questions and provided good customer service.

After I bought the mattress, I had problems with the delivery. It took three times to get it right.

I also ordered headboards for an adjustable base that I bought but the part that connects the headboard to the base was never sent and had to order them again.

All in all, it took three months to get it all squared away.

Overall, good customer service, but the process was difficult and made me regret going here.

Three stars for treating the customers right, but two stars off for everything going wrong after I made the payment.<//review>

I Have not got to this store yet , but to read the review from people , it gave me a suspicious though about this place. Why people not talking about the good or bad mattress which they bought but they only talk about the sales person who name Philip was perfect , very fishy to me .</Text>

If I can give more stars I would! This is  a great store with excellent customer service! Philip and Emmanuel are excellent. I am a repeat customer and will come back here anytime I need a mattress. From start to finish the service was great and I got an excellent deal I could not get anywhere else.< /text>

Philip Parker at mattress firm in Hayward was EXTREMELY helpful. He listened to my wife and I’s needs for the best night’s sleep. He is very attentive and makes sure you are getting the best deal! Anyone looking for a new mattress should give Philip a visit.</Text>

I received the most horrible service from this store down to the person who has going to deliver the mattress. When I purchased the mattress I requested delivery, I only have a certain window when I'm available because I work full time and then care for my grandfather who is on hospice right after. I can still work with some flexibility given notice, the sales guy said yeah I understand I'll note it. They were scheduled to deliver today in my mind I'm thinking after work then I get a call from this rude delivery person and I explain I thought I was going to be his last appointment, he starts to tell me his last appointment is at 4:00 PM so while he's talking I'm trying to scramble and see what I can do, my daughter gets home at 2:30 so I'm attempting to work with the guy and explain that my daughter will be home and he keeps cutting my off and telling, he's just a contractor he doesn't work for the company, and I shouldn't believe what the store says, they are always lying and it's not his problem. By this point I'm pissed because I was going to try to work with him. I call the store speak to the sales guys and apologizes for the delivery and assures me he'll never use that contractor again. So then he wants to reschedule and I let him know we are back at square one with my window of time. He then starts to become a little loud and tells me they have one warehouse that everyone pulls from and blah blah blah, by this point I say just cancel my order and refund my credit card. He tells me it will be about 10-15 days before I get it back. I understand that the protocols and I know my window is difficult but be honest and just say we won't be able to get you that delivery window then it's my choice to move forward or not, now I'm back at square one plus having to wait for the refund. From a customer's perspective it's not always the message that's difficult it's the delivery. I've worked in customer service and I know retail is a hard job trying to make the impossible possible but working with customer by clear communication with a little empathy goes a long way. EPIC FAIL 100% due to customer service and not product!</Text>

Wonderful and delightful experience
The service that was given to me by the sales person, Nasir Naeem was a very personable person that met me.He was very patient in finding out first what were my particular needs for the mattress I was looking for. He showed me 3 kinds and I settled for the Sealy extra firm one because I have a bad back. I told him that I already had a platform/bed to put it on. We added bunkies as he explained to me would make the mattress even more stable and height convenient and a PAB Tencel to protect the mattress from accidental spills and stains. Nasir was very thorough and impeccable in servicing my needs.
However,, through no fault of his and the manager,   I had to cancel the order since my wife said we had other priorities like buying a new dishwasher. She also told me that our present mattress was still very good and still very firm. I had to have a second opinion and asked my son, who is much heavier than me to try out the mattress and tell me how it felt. And he said that the mattress is still as firm and would still last another year or so.
Expect a visit from me again.< /Text>

We were help by Philip Parker. He was very knowledgeable about the different mattress and provided superior customer service. He did not pressure us but gave us the opportunity to ask as many question we needed. Our goal was to buy a mattress and box spring. However, we were so impressed by his presentation, we ended up buying an additional box spring for a king size bed.</text>

Philip was great, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. He was not pushy and gave us alot of time to figure out what we wanted. He showed us alot of choices and options available in different price ranges.
Also came back today for a price adjustment and it was so easy and hassle-free. Mattress Firm does guarantee the lowest price out there. Philip and Mattress Firm are outstanding, from sales and promotions, price match and satisfaction guarantees.
The delivery was easy to track and arrived on time as stated but the handling was not as smooth. The delivery team was confused on the removal of old beds and boxsprings but that was only a small hiccup and it all got handled in the end.
I recommend purchasing your mattress here and working with Philip. He's an awesome guy.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808f913ef2358a59:0x76c2cf4d8e1ee886<//GmapID></record>

<rating>5</rating><review>I went into the store yesterday to get my box spring replaced. The man who was working yesterday was so helpful and knowledgeable about the products around the store that I didn't feel like I missed out on anything. I was thinking of buying a moving base for my bed but when he showed me the box spring with draws I just couldn't pass it up! I had bought my mattress from them a year ago(same location, different person) and had the same experience of a highly knowledgeable staff with a great pleasant  demeanor. I made my first large "adult" purchase at this sleep train and felt so take care of with financing and delivery as well as pillows and bed frames. They were by far my best customer service experience when making a large purchase.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>So my girlfriend and I went in on August 6th and were greeted by Mike. He was friendly and cheerful and was helping out other customers but took the time to let us know he would help us out momentarily, and even joked with us, keeping the mood light. We laid and inspected EVERY bed at least twice, and we spent at least an hour trying them out. Just talking with Mike you could easily see he was very knowledgeable and he was a good guy. Fast forward to today, we came in and not only did he greet us and remember us, but he remembered the two beds we looked at and had been eyeing. This man deserves a raise. After another hour and a half of not being able to decide, we finally choose one. He had already discussed with us our various options, and did not mind us taking up his time at all. I recommend this store highly, and I almost never write a review because I almost never come across someone so deserving of it.
Also, he liked my shirt(Rick and Morty) and likes other things we do, so he gets cool points too. He's a very real guy who is genuine and he is what customer service should aspire to.

THANK YOU MIKE!< /text>< resp>

We are very happy with not only our mattress but the service Mike provided for us. My parents were purchasing it as a wedding present for us so there may have been a miscommunication when the frame we also ordered wasn’t delivered (nor was it on the invoice to deliver). We were too worried about it when we called Mike, he apologized and said there was a frame that fit in store we would just need to pick up. Although it was sort of inconvenient to have to pick it up, put it together and put the mattress back it wasn’t that big of a deal to us. Overall great experience. Mike really helped find what we were looking for especially because we had never shopped for a new mattress before.< /Text>< Pics>

My father and I walked into a nearby Sleep Train store to see about purchasing an adjustable posturepedic bed for my husband and I. I suffer from chronic back pain from multiple spinal surgeries and this type of bed was recommended for me from my orthopedic surgeon. From the moment we walked in the door, the CSR, Robert, had our full attention and cared about our every need. He made sure we were comfortable with our decision on the purchase we made and checked on competitive pricing before we made our purchase to make sure we were getting the best possible deal. Lastly, Robert made it possible for our old mattress to be removed and for us to be sleeping on our new bed the SAME EVENING!!!! I was treated like a family friend by a perfect stranger. THAT...is hard to find these days..< /Review>

<Text>If you're looking for a new bed, drop by this location and ask for Mike! Michael Graff is the man!

I dropped by the store, no call, no appointment, and was instantly greeted by Mike. He got up from his desk, walked up and introduced himself with a handshake; good start!

I let him know we're looking for a firm mattress to which he asked us the right questions to ensure we knew what we were talking about.

He directed us to a specific spot in the store that had all 3 different types of firm mattresses to see what we liked best. From here he let us wonder around and try out damn near every bed he's got 1,000,000 times while he informed us tho pros/cons of each bed. No sales pitch, just genuine information.

As usual, i'm a pain in the ass when it comes to the price of things so I asked if I found the bed we fell in love for cheaper somewhere online, would they match it? This prompted Mike to look for us while we screwed around some more in his store popping from bed to bed.

At sign out, as is tradition, I offered to pay all up front if we could knock a couple of bucks off the price. Mike was super helpful in this department and was able to sneak in some discounted box springs, free bed frame and free delivery.

I told him I wasn't interested in the protector as i'm not prone to eating/drinking in bed to which he educated me on warranties and how protectors pay for themselves, just in that department alone. Needless to say, after the transaction, I went back for the protector that we worked out a deal on as well.

I appreciate it Mike, you da' man :)</Text>< time>

<Review>Wow !! Best Experience ever!

Whoever said Mattress salesmen are just salesmen obviously have not been to Sleep Train, much less met their Superstar Nalan.

This being the 3rd stop on our list, we felt totally at home with the whole mattress shopping process. We walked in to Sleep Train, hopped onto the first memory foam bed we saw, kicked up our feet , got comfortable, and waited a few minutes for our body to settle in. Nalan walked up shortly to greet us and asked us if this was the bed we wanted since we saw it and hopped on right away. Lol, we told him that we had been shopping today and were in the groove of things already.

We went over the basics of pillows, coolness, memory foam, hybrids, adjustable bases, pretty much the whole shebang. Nalan was very informative and knowledgeable, but we already had a bed in mind, and that was the Tempur-pedic Contour Supreme. Nalan helped us with the estimates, and let us know the Tempur-pedic deals for this month, and we went home to sleep on it ( on our terribly uncomfortable bed).

As some of you may know, buying a Tempur is a large financial commitment. After 2 days of thinking, we decided the quality of our sleep was worth it, and the 10 year warranty from Tempur-pedic gives us additional assurance. We were ready to take the plunge, but where? After all we did go to 3 stores that all offer the same product.

In the end, I decided that the purchase would be made at sleep train with Nalan. In the 2 days prior to the purchase date, I called Nalan several times to ask questions and change our package and quote. Every time I called, He was patient, kind, and never rushed me on the phone, no matter how many questions I had for him. We even made the decision to upgrade the size from a Queen to a King size when we went into the store to place the order, and changed the package again one final time lol. The entire experience, not once did we feel pressured, pushed, or unimportant. (For those of you that don't know me, I ask ALOT of questions , and can be quite a handful to work with.)

Right now, Tempurpedic is offering goodies like free pillows, free delivery etc, and delivery can be made as soon as the same day, but we opted for Sunday delivery. YES ! They offer Sunday and weekend delivery. This is so convenient. I was nervous about not getting the confirmation call (the evening before), so I googled sleep train delivery, and you can actually type the phone number on your order, and find your delivery time, and get delivery status, ALL ONLINE!! Wow cool is that? Funny thing is, the confimation call ended up coming in 5 minutes after I found the info online, with a 830AM-1030AM Delivery window. The next morning, I got a call 30 mins before the actual delivery so we can be prepared, and we made sure we cleared the entry way and room etc. Once the truck pulled up, I witnessed the fastest frame install ever (Possibly a world record was set that morning), the bases flew onto the frames a minute later, and our HUGE mattress was expertly navigated through our narrow stair case and made a swift landing on the frame. Before we knew it, we were already set up on our new bed, and it was only 9am!

Now this is really classifies 5 star service, is when you can call up your Mattress salesman, even AFTER the delivery to ask questions, and feel like you are talking to an old friend. People, People, This is the service you want when making a purchase to better your sleep and your life. From point of sale, to delivery and follow up, there is just no comparison elsewhere.

If you have been avoiding mattress shopping, then wait no more! Come to Sleep Train and look for Nalan. Nalan will go above and beyond the call of duty to ensure you personally will be a happy customer.

Now... After this long review, lets end with a song.. *Sleep Train.... Your ticket to a better nights sleep..*< /Review>< Pictures>

Thank you Dr. Freeman for your professional and compassionate care for our dog Ginger.  We had very difficult decisions to make as Ginger had a situation which would normally call for surgery, but she was very old and had other health issues as well.

Dr. Freeman explained all of the options and the woman who took Ginger in (sorry I don't know your name) was very kind and compassionate as well.  Unfortunately Ginger passed just before her next appointment, but in the future if I should ever need visionary services for my pets I would feel confident in taking them here.<//text>

Why so expensive! doctor visit meaning first time eye exam is 250.00 just to see whats wrong with your pet. On top of the crisis we are all in it’s unaffordable for people like me.< /Review>

<Review>The staff is professional and very caring. Among the doctors, it's good to see more than just one. the opinions vary Depending on who you see during your visit.. Ask lots of questions and do your own research on line. I feel you have be your own advocates. But that's true with anything. All said they restored my dogs eyesight, which added much happiness to the final years of her life<//Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
The receptionist I spoke with this afternoon was extremely rude and told me at first when I explained how my dogs eye is going out that I'm concerned because now both eyes are and she kept asking me what she could see or if she was blind I told her I know her right eye is going out and I dont know what she can see but that I read when eyes are involved it is emergency because they can lose their sight. After going back and forth I said so basically it's not an emergency your telling me until she goes blind because ur saying u csnt see her unless she is blind. I told her I read it's rather important and that my vet said to call her because she needs to be seen asap mind u I already scheduled an appt but they said they were booked for a month and couldnt let me know if their was a cancellation that I'd have to reach out to them which is what I did today on my day off. I told her I would have my vet call her and that's all she had to inform me of if their was a chance to be seen sooner. She said ok and hung up on me.  Sucks because they are my only option closeby and all I ask is for her to just tell me to have my vet call them. They already knew I was referred from 1st call so why cop attitude when all.im saying is I just need to know I'd u can see me sooner I'm not the professional here u are supposed to be.i make it a point to give out of my way customer service especially with pets so I get really frustrated in situations like this. I'm sure the doctors are great but the receptionist is another story but unfortunately you have to get thru the rude ones sometimes before u can get the right info.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>We have brought multiple small dogs here over the years - Dry eye, cataract surgery, eye removal, detached retinas. Every time our companions are treated with the utmost care and respect. The dogs health is always the priority,  while the person is always allotted the care and consideration relative to the gravity of the situation.
Appointments are always timely. Though most people would not put a price on their companion,  I must say the costs here are very reasonable, relative to other specialty vets in the Bay Area.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f7d906bc44feb:0xa150d48b878cb4f8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The vets themselves are solid but our favorite is Dr. Cook - she has the most creativity when it comes to treatment options and great communication as well.<//Review></record>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO READ MY STORY. They're good at what they do somehow. However, like 90% of the Vet nowadays, they always convince you to go through surgery regardless what happened. My 13 years old Corgi, suffer from  cataract for so many years still living like usual (not exactly bothering his normal like).

One day he experience some dry eye issues so I bought him here for an exam. The vet said something wrong with his eye that it won't generate tears anymore. Bcuz the eyeball is dry so the eyeball will develop redness. She strongly suggested for an surgery to remove the eye ball altogether. Yeah, you hear it right, REMOVE THE EYE BALL bcuz of dry eyes. She estimated $3000 ballpark figure, which I don't even concern about. I just don't want my 13 years old dog, suffer from cataract already and now he needs to lose his eyeball.

So I refuse, of course, and I said regardless what happened unless it's live threatening, I won't let my dog go through a surgery at ago 13. Then the vet prescribed a couple different kind of eye drop, including antibiotic,   artificial tears stuff like that. I continue the eye drop for 2 weeks, his eye dryness and redness  are all gone. Not only he can keep his eye and he can keep his eye rolling. So don't just rely on ONE vet opinions and don't put your dog on the surgery table so easy.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Yum! Landed here at midnight last night and was surprised to learn they only had vegan options. Ordered the impossible burger which was delicious and fresh. The fries were perfectly crispy. Loved how fast my order came out and how friendly and attentive the staff were. Will return here again!< /review>

This restaurant is my preferable restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I like it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to visit this place. Whenever  I want to go to a good supper, this place comes straight to my head. excellent and diverse  food and a rich cuisine.professional team, and agreeable spirit. And very important, the cost is reasonable. I recommend this restaurant with no hesitation.</Review>

As a family we have been going to New Shanghai for 16 years, my husband has been going for over 20. I was raised on the east coast and found this to be the best representation of the Chinese food I love. Not greasy, but perfectly seasoned. Our favorites are the House Chicken and BBQ pork fried rice, as well as the Orange Chicken and Beef & Broccoli. Everyone we take here instantly falls in love. We thank Anna and her family for running such a customer-focused business and making us feel so loved in your business.< /text>

Our first time here, and the food was Great!
The prices are even better, and you get what you pay for when it comes to portions. This is a hidden gem in the area.
They are open only for take - out.
And they are in the Carl's jr Shopping center, right there on Regency Ln and Lake Forest.
Thank you! Thank you! It's been awhile since we've had authentic Chinese food while living around here. We will be back!< /text>

<Text>This place is fine if you do not like real Chinese food. The food I had here was so flavorless and bland it reminded me of food fed to kids not ready for real Chinese food. If you want real Chinese food, I would suggest almost any other Chinese restaurant down the road in Irvine. 2 stars because the service and owners are nice--as I understand they have to cater to the tastes of their predominantly non-Asian clientele, but this place is the furthest thing from authentic Chinese food...< /Text><username>Mei Li Chin</username><Response>None<//Response><Rate>2<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

I've been coming here for 12+ years.   The food is amazing and the prices are fair.  The service is always good.  This place has had the same owner for almost 30 years.  I LOVE eating here.  The atmosphere is quiet and casual but not shabby at all.  I've done many a date here and not a single one of them has complained.<//text>

<review>First time here. The food was really good and  their prices are very reasonable, lower than many other similar restaurants. Service, from my experience, was very good, too. The restaurant is not fancy by any means but it has a very relaxed atmosphere. And no, I'm not getting freebies for good reviews, I just like to give good credit where it is rightfully due.<//review><rate>5<//rate><user_id>103414763681429415496<//user_id></record>

We tried to visit and take-away food as much as we could during the global pandemic that threw a monkey wrench into everyone's lives.  Their food was still amazing.  As we've come to realize, though, nothing beats eating the food right out of the kitchen.

We were fortunate enough to dine in with capacity restricted seating the other night, and I think I scared a few people with my "Mmmms" and "OOHH!!" ... the food is absolutely amazing.  I missed it so much.

An unassuming place with unassuming food. This place is legit. The staff are very friendly, the prices are great, and the portions are perfect. The Chow Fun here is better than anywhere else that I've had it in all of south County, as is the mapo tofu. Will definitely be back!<//review>

We've never actually eaten inside here; we always get delivery or pickup and it's always been great. Their prices are relatively low (they ARE a restaurant, not the steam-tray kind of quick-meal Chinese place), and usually very quick. They always tell us that our food will take an hour to be delivered, but more often it's at our place within half that. Sometimes they even throw in some cream cheese wontons for free!

I'll really miss this place, now that I've moved away.< /review>

My family has been coming to New Shanghai for years and years. The owner (who knows us well) has always had an enthusiastic attitude and is always pleasant to the patrons. The tea is wonderful (if that's your thing like it is ours) and the food is consistently good. This restaurant is only a few minutes from my work and located in a quiet plaza so it's easy to get in and out on my lunch break with some paper wrapped chicken.<//review>

We have loved this place for years.  Very yummy food.  House, Orange, and Lemon chicken are my favorites.  Complete meal gives soup, appetizers and tea as well.  We still drive over sometimes even though it's no longer our area.  Still our favorite Chinese.</text>

<Review>The service is friendly. The food tastes fresh and sauces are very good. Lunch special is a great value. Love the house chicken. The kids like the food as well. Located near the sports park and Foothill Ranch town center.</Review>< pictures>

I'm from a different country, where Chinese food might be a little different but it was always high quality! I ordered the crispy duck, and it was horrible! I mean it tasted okay but it looked horrible, I don't think I will ever eat duck in american Chinese restaurants again :( :X it was full of bones I even couldn't take real bites of it! I traveled a lot around the world and this was the worst duck meal from a Chinese restaurant that I've ever eaten! But other meals seem to be okay! Please don't be affected by my own opinion! taste it for yourself!< /text>

They were so kind when picking up my order. The woman smiled and greeted me. She checked on me and the food. They up dated me on the food. They double checked and made sure they had it all correct before letting it out the door.</review>

<review>I ate here with my mother-in-law.  It was close to her house so we picked this restaurant based on convenience.  When we arrived, the sound system was playing static and no one made a move to fix/turn it off until we asked about it.  The service was okay, but nothing to write home about.  The food was very bland and decidedly lacking in protein content.  (No shrimp in the shrimp dish.)  This was probably in the bottom 20% of my Chinese restaurant experiences.</review>< pictures>

I read the reviews and saw the 4.2 stars so I decided to order. I honestly don't know how this place got 4 stars... The food is blah and the chicken was DRY!!! I ordered chicken and broccoli and there wasn't even any sauce on it... Just chicken, broccoli and carrots... Very very strange.. And the potstickers were pork when the website said chicken.. And they were so badly burnt I couldn't even eat them I just threw them in the trash... AVOID THIS PLACE PLEASE ITS NOT WORTH THE WAIT OR THE MONEY!!!< /review>

The Chicken Chow Mein was delicious and was the right amount of food. I just didn't like how the fortune cookie was inside with my food.< /review>< pics>

New Shan Hai is a cozy Chinese restaurant.  My husband and I love their food.  The lunch special prices are low and taste good.  We go there quite often, love it!<//review>

If you want to have a conversation during the meal, you don’t want to go here. This place can get crowded and noisy but the food is worth it I think.</Text>

<review>I have ordered both pick up and dine in. The food and service has been great both times. Everyone is friendly and the portions are great! My husband and i always have left overs and we eat alot. The family dinner is reasonable priced with a variety. They also offer delivery if you live close by. Unfortunately i dont live in delivery range. That being said i make the drive from aliso viejo because i like the food that much. Thank you New shanghai!</review>< resp>

Very disappointing! If I could give zero stars, I would. No real Shanghai items on the menu, all "American Style Chinese" food. The oil used to cook the dumplings tasted old, even though the waitress denied it.
The other items we ordered were just as bad. The fried noodles were chewy and tough, and the sauce tasted like it came out of a can.
There are so many better Chinese  restaurants in Orange County, like Sam Woo or J. Zhou. Don't waste you time our money.
ETA :
Just wanted to add that my wife is Chinese, and has run a restaurant in her past, so we do know what we are talking about</text>

This is your standard old-school american chinese restaurant, complete with the chinese zodiac placemats in the booths, and the pre-brewed hot tea with crunchy noodles and sweet and sour sauce served when you arrive.  Staff is friendly and the food is decent.  The interior is a little dingy but it has that "real thing" feel to it, probably looking exactly the same as it did 20 years ago or more.  Would recommend if you are looking for chinese that is a step up from the hole-in-the-wall fast food type of chinese, but not the P.F. Chang's or other fancy chinese restaurant formality.< /Text>

We go every year and my daughter and niece always have a great time. Unfortunately, this year it started pouring rain and everything was shut down around 8:30pm rides weren't  running because of the safety issues. We spent over $100.00 for parking, wristbands, and getting into the fair. Not including drinks etc.  (That was for 3 people...I can't imagine big families) luckily for us Mark Wills was there and that helped bring the evening to a nice close. We left literally drenched because of the rain. I don't know what they do when you pay ahead of time for wristbands that you can't use. It says nonrefundable. I think they should have something in place to help with buying ahead of time. (THEY MAY I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ASK). Tomorrow is suppose to rain also. I hope things work out. Thank you to Mark Wills for saving the evening. Good luck to those that are going tomorrow. (I know that the people who work for the fair are wonderful people...I got to know them this year) I understand it's nobody's fault for the rain. I feel bad for all the people and families that paid so much money and left disappointed. 🙁</text>

So much regulations and rules that were not told to us untill the day of the party. We couldn't have the volume too loud and were required to stay within the sound meter. Couldn't set up for the party the day before until specific hours. Couldn't put the Cooling system on untill later on in the day and couldn't be above medium. Hot as heck. Worst part, couldn't turn off the lights for the dance floor. Had to skip the slideshow and the light show because it's a liability to turn the lights off. Wouldn't recommend venue for any type of party.<//Review>< Pics>

They do an amazing job.  You walk out relaxed with their message techniques.  If you come in with a picture of what you want, they do an beautiful job! Top choice in Yuba City.<//Review>

Terrible experience! $50 for a full set with gel. Ridiculously expensive compared to other places in town. The girl did my nails really thick and kept arguing with me it wasn't the nails, it was the polish that was thick. So I had her change the color and start over. Not only were they STILL super thick, but she left some of the old color under and you could see it under the new color. She also definitely had an attitude because I asked her to re-do them and they still looked terrible. On top of that, they ask how much you're going to tip them while they're charging your card which I think is in poor taste. Never going back!<//text>

Absolutely disliked the service. I asked if the nail tech was going to finish shaping my nails and she said later. But she never came back to shape them. Not to mention I spent around two hours for nails that were done terribly wrong. I don’t recommend this place at all not even if you are in desperate need. Not worth the long wait for horrible nails.<//Text>

Today marks a week since my service and I will have to get another gel manicure. Cuticles not removed properly, gel polish not even close to the sides of my nail or too close to where it is now going to peel if I tug it, bubbles . I asked the girl to fix it and she did not. My pedi was alright, she trimmed my toes too short but eh, they will grow back. Another thing that I have to mention is the fact that when I was done and ready to pay, she gave me a total of $65 for gel mani and a pedi and asked how much to charge my card, I said $70, she looked at me and says $70????? I looked at her and said : 75 whatever. She basically demanded a higher tip, I was in good spirits so I wasn't gonna argue, it left a bad taste in my mouth, first you do a poor job and then demand a bigger tip? She was lucky I even considered a $5 tip. At the end of the day, I do not have to get my nails done there, I will find another salon, but they need good customers and good reviews.

<Review>Don’t ever go to VN nails in Yuba City by Walmart. Most disgusting place w rude ppl. Not only did i have nail polish on my skin but they use like a tablespoon of wax in bag the put on your feet. When they put the hot towel around you they barely wrap your legs and miss your feet. The towels they use are so dingy and gross and look like they haven’t been washed in years. This happen to both me and my friend that went. Don’t go there!</Review><gmap_id>0x8084ab600eeb0ee3:0x963c15e513bd0f0c</gmap_id><Time>1532874022817<//Time>< Pictures>

Anyone reading this, I beg you please do not to go here for your own safety. My wife went to remove her acrylic nails, the nail tech cut her pinky finger open and then tore off HALF of her REAL NAIL on her ring finger...she left with both hands bleeding and she is now missing half a nail and her finger has been bleeding for two days....the woman who did this was rude and looked like she had no idea what she was doing...she was yelling and i had absolutely no idea what she was saying....THIS PLACE SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN!!!!< /Text>

<review>I wish zero stars was an option, we weren’t shopping for a bridal party, just a prom dress. I made a reservation and we arrive shortly before our appointment time. The young lady at the check in podium was extremely rude and sent us over to wait by another counter. I had to get someone attention, no one approached us. My daughter had selected several dresses she want to try on and I was told there were no rooms available, I told the girl I had an appointment and she stated she would have to look in to it. We waited several more minutes. The whole experience reminded me of why I stopped shopping at David’s Bridal years ago. We definitely won’t be going back. If you want good customer service I would recommend going somewhere else.</review></record></dataset><record>

The Quality,  the Helpfulness, the Kindness, the Complete Feeling of being Cinderella -  come Here!! Ask for CAILEE and LAURIE! Must ASK for them! Such amazing customer support from them, but ALL of the ladies are SO SWEET and SPECIAL!  -Absolutely Amazing selection of colors,  styles,  sizes- complete with alterations, ON and ON! You don't have to be getting married to come here! If you need a dress (at a great, affordable,  reasonable price) for ANY OCCASION,  COME HERE! I Cannot Recommend them more! You will Not be disappointed!!!<//Review>

Raymond was so great to work with. He was knowledge of the products and was able to recommend the best styles for my bridesmaids figure. We walked out with an off the rack dress that looked stunning on my bridesmaid in the color of our wedding, olive green.  He was a breath of fresh air to work with he was attentive and was able to answer all our questions.< /Review>

<Date>1616113593420<//Date><text>Just got my dress altered and it was the best experience! Shout out to Nhu ! She altered my dress beautifully! I am short lol and she took the time to get everything detail perfect. She deserves more than a 5 star! Another shout out to Karen! She was so friendly, and she gave me a background on my dress designer, Cassini. The dress is even more meaningful now to me knowing who designed this dress. I willcome back to David's Bridal , and so will my sister. You eased the stress fully . From the bottom of my heart thank you and thank you for making me feel beautiful and for accepting my body and curves even more now.< /text><UserId.>102576605999720120999< /UserId.>< pics>

I went to David’s Bridal 2 weeks before my wedding. I made an appointment and met TAMMY (my stylist) she was AMAZING!!! I was greeted with a huge smile! She gave me choices of wedding dresses I never thought I’d wear! Every single stylist was cheering me on as I was trying the beautiful dresses on. They had to find and order my size and JUANA stepped in. She’s PHENOMENON!!! I absolutely LOBE everybody from this store! METZELI, EMILY, MARISOL and the rest of the crew are absolutely AMAZING! They all made me feel EXTREMELY SPECIAL! Thank you so much everyone for making my journey a VERY SPECIAL AND MEMORABLE ONE!!!<//text>

Of course he picked out a handful of dresses that fit every criteria I had mentioned. Raymond knows his stuff! And with his well trained eye for style, he guided me to a dress I am in love with!
I can’t thank Raymond and David’s Bridal enough!< /review></record>

I came into David’s Bridal not knowing what I wanted and how my budget would look like. Jennifer was so helpful and understood what I wanted. What I loved about Jennifer was how after each fitting she asked me how I felt in the dress. After trying dress after dress, I found out what type of style I wanted she left and came back with 2 dresses she found that was my style. I tried them on and I said yes to the dress she found for me. If anyone feels hesitant to enter a David’s bridal, don’t be. Jennifer was so patient, understanding, and helpful! I definitely recommend Jennifer to anyone who wants to go to David’s Bridal.</text>

Raymond was absolutely EPIC! Not only did he make the experience great, he gave me goosebumps and I teared up when I saw myself in the dress he picked for me. I never thought I’d be THAT girl but I was. I only tried on one dress, the dress Raymond picked, and it was perfect!<//review>

I had an amazing experience at this David's Bridal! Carla was absolutely wonderful and I'm so glad she helped me throughout the whole process. In just two visits, I was able to find a dress that I loved within the budget price that I asked for. I have yet to come back to get alterations done closer to my wedding date, but I'm very happy with the service I've received so far.< /review>

The team helped me pick out my perfect dress last year. Since covid hit, my husband and I had to postpone our wedding a few times but are able to finally go to Thailand this year to have the actual ceramony. Mykim was exceptional when it comes to tailoring my dress. Not only did she stitch and hem everything that I had imagined, but also gave me some unique and time-worthy locations to visit in Thailand to celebrate our wedding/honeymoon. Thank you so much Mykim for my perfect dress but your input on locations in Thailand to visit!<//review>

MyKim is an amazing seamstress! When I first bought my dress in early 2020 it was already a little big. I ended up losing 45 pounds before the wedding, so there was a LOT of material to cut off and correct. MyKim did a beautiful job on the alterations! I couldn’t believe the dress would fit as well as did. I was very impressed and thankful for such quality work on such a big day!</review>

<Review>This was my first time shopping for my wedding dress and I FOUND THE PERFECT DRESS. However, I could not do it alone. My wonderful stylist Raymond had me in the perfect dress on dress #2. He was completely understanding of budget. I could not have found the perfect dress without him. He also helped us with my bridesmaids dresses and again helped us stay in a reasonable budget.

He made the morning so fun and so exciting. He was so good at making me feel comfortable and just making a genuine connection with us.

I seriously can not explain how thankful I am for the help I received from Raymond. I will be requesting him for future appointments !!</Review>< Pics>

I really wish there was a zero star because they don't deserve anything. I got horrible service. It was my first experience to go look at bridesmaid dresses for my wedding and I left upset and frustrated. I was very specific on what I wanted with the style and color and she just pointed out where they were located so I can find them myself. She mentioned to me that certain dresses won't have them in the color I wanted and some only came in certain sizes which made it super difficult to have choices. Then she mentioned that the ones that are on sale might not have them later. So I told her, please find me dresses that are in my color and the styles I want. So, the lady brings all these dresses for my bridesmaids to try on, after we fell in love with one of the dresses, she tells us that it doesn't come in the color I wanted!!! The lady that helped me totally disregarded what I told her and made me really turned off from even picking a dress. I felt like I had to settle for a dress I didn't really like. Did I mention that I wanted to try on wedding dresses and they said they can fit me in after the bridesmaids fittings? When I reminded them, they said they were completely booked. It made me more enraged how unorganized they were not only with making broken promises, but how unorganized theses dresses are to look and find. I felt like I didn't really get a lot of support from the lady that was assigned to helping us.  Please DO NOT waste your time at this store.< /text>

<Text>Loved the variety of styles, colors and sizes at David's Bridal in Costa Mesa, CA. My stylist Raymond was fantastic! I felt as if he really understood my best features, my personality and my body type and of course helped me choose the best outfit for my daughter's wedding. As the Mother of the Bride, I was able to purchase a modern yet sophisticated pants suit in the color desired and for the right price. I will shop at DB again for my upcoming son's wedding! Highly recommended for wedding and gown shopping...< /Text>< Pics>

<review>This review is for Carla, she was my design associate at the Costa Mesa location. She made me feel at ease and made my experience very pleasant! If I could I would give her all the stars in the sky because she was that amazing! This was the first place I went to check out dresses and didn't expect to purchase anything until I've hit a few other places. But to my surprise, Carla helped me find a beautiful dress that I felt amazing in so I ended up purchasing it!

<Review>Every time I’ve been in this David’s bridal it’s been crazy. The day of my appointment was no different. It took someone a while to finally come assist me and my guests. They girl who started helping us was great initially, but then before we were done, she left us because she had another appointment. And there wasn’t someone helping us at this point. So finally someone did come help get us rung up, and my bridesmaids pay for their dresses. It was fine, but someone dropped the ball halfway through</Review><GmapID>0x80dcdf39820ccf1d:0x418e1dde81487a7d</GmapID>< Time>

I got to go with a soon to be bride to find her perfect dress today and that’s what happened! She found her perfect beautiful wedding dress with the AMAZING help of Raymond! Let me just say he made this day extremely special and the best experience for the bride and her crew! He was so informative as to how the appointment was going to go in such a fun personal way. He knows what he’s doing when finding a dress for a bride. Raymond truly was the best!</text>

After purchasing 4 dresses, one from China (on the web) I had to return all and donate one.  I thought David’s bridal would be out of my budget. I was so wrong.I found the most gorgeous dress, perfectly styled for me and within my budget!  I highly recommend David’s Bridal! Nicci, my stylist,  was extremely helpful.</Review>

It can be intimidating since I am uncomfortable in the limelight, but she gave me great tips, brought new dresses to try super fast, and was really nice. I enjoyed my time there today and will book with her again to narrow down my choices with family. Thank you Tammy!<//Review>< Pics>

I had a great experience. Anjuli was such a huge help. She pulled the dresses I liked, and gave great advice on the best way to make my decision. She was very knowledgeable, and if she wasn’t sure, she asked alterations or a manager right away. I’m very happy with my decision on my dress, and look forward to the final product.<//review>

The stylist who helped me, Tammy , was absolutely lovely and fantastic and made my first bridesmaid dress buying experience super great and comfortable despite being in a pandemic. She was so sweet and patient and I truly appreciate her and the rest of the staff who were there as they made my entire experience  comfortable and easy. The shop was super clean and organized and helped me find the right size/style. It made it a lot easier then shopping online . Would definitely recommend this location.</Text>

I have had a great experience at David’s Bridal in Costa Mesa. I’ve been there a few times now in the past few months working on dress fittings and shopping for my wedding, getting all the accessories. Khahn in the alterations department has helped me twice so far and has been super helpful. She made sure I was comfortable and made sure she answered all my questions. If I have to go back in for the last final fitting and need adjustments, she said she would be there for me. Thank you for making me feel welcome at this location!</text>

The stylist and check out employees were incredibly helpful. I had a unique situation (in additional to COVID) where my dress needed to be shipped to NJ for my sister's wedding. Due to the back order of dresses ( covid) my dress was not going to be shipped before I leave for NJ. So the employees worked out a situation where it would be shipped to NJ in time for the wedding. They were incredibly helpful. (let's hope they follow through with what they promised) I will update if they don't.

There were a lot of people in the store (multiple large groups of women trying on bridesmaids dresses) so while searching for a dress it was hard to social distance but once you got a dressing room, you were able to stay in your space and away from others.

The stylist helped me find a lovely dress. David's bridal is not known for being a high class bridal boutique but having a stylist (even though she was helping multiple people at the same time) was helpful. I think they did that hoping to reduce the customers on the floor looking at dresses. (didn't really work out that way) but overall, good experience with customer service.< /Text>

<review>I bought my wedding dress at this location and had an amazing experience..... but come 2 years later I am in one of my bridesmaids weddings and I got the dress covid happens wedding got postponed.... I lost weight the dress is not 1 dress size to big... my luck they don’t make the dress anymore it’s discontinued, but what I don’t understand is they still make it in the long dress style... I went in to see if I could have it taken in the dress I already had and the seamstress was so unprofessional and rude, she also quoted me $140.00. I called the Long Beach store to see if they could help they were far better at customer service then the Costa Mesa one was and they said I had been over quoted and they quoted me $104 for the taking in of the dress... so I guess don’t go to the Costa Mesa store if you want to be treated nicely.... from the seamstress that is anyway...</review><response>{'time': 1615225222162, 'text': 'Hello Rebecca, we are so sorry to hear that our team has disappointed you, and we appreciate you taking the time to share this feedback so that we can assist our team in correcting these issues.

Customer service was sorely lacking. Huge disparity in regards to treatment. Another group had the managers attention, I felt the manager could see we were just waiting toward the end of our apt. The girl never came back, she said she was going to see her online inventory but she didn’t come back. The manager asked about service as we were leaving so I told her. The girl, Alexia saw us leave and didn’t say anything. Felt rushed at the beginning while looking at dresses. Just awful throughout. Customer service is key to any business, I’ve been to three different stores and service is mediocre but this was the worst experience here so far. You really need to train your employees better. I’m frankly surprised how you’re still in business when there are other bridal shops with better selection, price and most of all service!<//review>

She is well experienced working with wedding dresses and she goes above and beyond to make sure you get the best deal AND look extra good on your wedding day. I put all my trust in her with my mother-in-laws wedding dress from the 80s and I highly recommend that you get your wedding dress altered by her too!</Text>< username>

I honestly didn’t know by scheduling an appointment I would get a personal stylist. 😍😍
Angie is amazing. She helped me pick the perfect dress. I Wasn’t able to get a friends to come with me and Bride and other Bridesmaids are out of state, So it was just me. I was texting them and sending pictures but so not the same.
If it weren’t for Angie I would I have been There forever and may have not purchased anything. I also would have never grabbed the dress to even try it on. So my advice is schedule an appointment and get the full experience. They gave the desired dresses for you and help Narrow it  down and if the dress isn’t available in the store they can order it for you and mine will come in just enough time to have it altered if needed.
Having the stylist is so worth it.
Thank you Angie.<//Review>

I thought I’d be best off doing the first appointment in the morning, but it was AWFUL for social distancing. I haven’t felt this uncomfortable in a crowd since this all started. Every room was full (brides, bridesmaids, flower girls) and then there were entourages. Totally unsafe. I’d say that would need to cut the capacity by half.<//Text>

I absolutely loved my appointment at David's with Carla. I came in with my fiancee so we could both try on dresses (yes, we're two women). Carla made us feel so comfortable and was asking the right questions to help us find the dresses we loved best. My partner found her dress and though I didn't see it, she told me afterward how she was crying happy tears and this made me so happy. I also found my dress and felt the most beautiful and special I ever have in my life. Highly recommend this location as Carla and the other associates were amazing!< /Review>

<review>Hands down Khanah is Amazing ! She got in me in last minute for an appointment for an alteration on my bridesmaid dress. Upon arrival , I was greeted with great energy from not only the front desk but also Khanah as well. She made sure that I had a clean room to change and also made me feel comfortable. Super professional , made suggestions , and got me out of there in a timely manner. Thank You Khanah, you are the best !< /review>< UserId.>

I had a great experience.  Found my dress quickly, wasn't crazy about how it looked on me, (I'm a older mother of the bride, age 66) however after visiting the ladies in alterations, the dress fits beautifully on me.  Everyone was very nice and helpful!< /text>

I already had a few dresses I wanted to try on, and she patiently helped me get into each one and pick out accessories and veils for each dress. Courtney is one of the easiest person to work with and it was so easy to talk to her about what I liked, didn't like, etc. She is a true professional! I went into the store without any expectations and she helped me find the right dress in 2 hours. She wasn't pushy and she was super attentive to my needs. We also just kind of clicked, which was nice. :)</review>< UserId.>

<review>This was my second time at David’s Bridal because my experience in a NY location was horrid and I never got to try on all the dresses I liked. I booked at this location and went in with a fresh mind not holding anything against this location. Anji was my person assigned to help me and I couldn’t have asked for anyone else more wonderful. She expressed concern over my negative first experience, she listened thoroughly to me and went over my liked dresses and made sure they would all be available in time for my wedding as well as in the color I wanted. This was a very nice step to avoid wasting our time. I really appreciated that. I also liked how she made suggestions and brought over items to help accentuate a shape, or add design to an otherwise plain dress. I did not find “the one” but what stuck with me most was when Anji asked me before I left: “I just want to know if I did everything I could to at least help you narrow down your choices and help you get closer to finding your dress? It’s your wedding day, you shouldn’t settle and have regrets later. But as long as I know I did everything I could then I know I did my job.” Anji, you were incredible and you do your job very well. I really appreciate you and thank you for your time.</review>< Pics>

What an amazing experience !!! I bought my dress a year ago before the pandemic hit and had an amazing time with Carla - she’s got a great eye and is so supportive. Then when I returned with my dress almost a year later Lani took care of my alterations and wow what a job!! She gave me a fantastic waist line and perfectly hemmed my lace dress so that no one could tell that it wasn’t made especially for me. The ladies made me feel beautiful and special and I highly recommend this shop to anyone !!< /text>

Literally, a one stop place to get it all done!
My daughter and I shopped all around to find her beautiful dress. Then all over department stores for her shoes which she settled for because all of their stock was low inventor, online etc... Last we ordered the flower girl’s dress which was quite a bit different than in the photo online. Last minute I called to see if they had any flower girl dresses. I made an appt for the next day and oh my did they ever have the dresses. Like a hundred of them. I easily found the perfect dress that will match my daughters dress. Everybody is happy and very willing to help especially Julissa, Zoe and Dulce! Julissa tried on veils for me to take pictures of, and sent them to my daughter, to see if they were better than the one my daughter is awaiting in the mail. David helped out answering many pertinent questions. Also, the manager and Zoe kept popping over to ask me how was everything going and did I need anything at all.
In a Nutshell, David’s Bridal make shopping with the bride a pleasant and a QUICK one!! I could have saved so much time!💨💨</Text>

The ladies here at David’s Bridal made me feel so special. I went alone but felt like I had my own crew of ladies cheering me on. Ms. Carla is absolutely amazing, not only at what she does as a professional stylist, but just an amazing soul. I absolutely thank God that I met Ms. Carla today. Without her, my wedding wouldn’t be what it is going to be! She helped me find the perfect dress in the most perfect size. Hands down, best client service I’ve ever had!!! I will be back.</review>

<Review>After having to postpone our wedding twice we decided to have a small ceremony with just family so I needed a dress to reflect that. I can say that after finding my original dress at a well know bridal salon in NYC I had a WAY better experience at David's Bridal. Vart, who helped me, was amazing. So accommodating, really listed to what I was looking for, made both me and mom feel so comfortable with trying new thing ect. I would recommend this store to all types of brides.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><time>1612462961256</time>< response>

Raymond was my stylist. He was wonderful to work with. He made the experience fun and was very helpful in selecting dresses that fit what I was looking for. The alterations department was also very nice and helpful.<//Review>

<review>I had a lovely experience at this location.  The staff lady who was helping me was very sweet and offered great suggestions for dress styles i was looking for.   What i loved most is that she incorporated various different veils, hair pins, and sashes to accent the dresses i was trying on.  It was amazing to me how much adding accents can bring together the bridal look!  She also brought me a pair of heels to try the dresses on with and offered spanx, bras, etc at the start of the session.  Of all the places i had already been to, David's Bridal was the only place that offered so many accomodations like this.  There were LOTS of mirrors everywhere and LOTS of space allowing for you to walk around in your dress to see how it feels and looks from all different angles.  Even though i ended up going alone, the friendly staff made me feel welcome and taken care of.  I highly recommend this location!!!< /review>< Pics>

I walked in today feeling anxious and worried that I was not going to find a dress for my wedding this December but my Fairy godmother Alex was there to the rescue! She was so professional and knew exactly what dress I was not feeling. She was amazing from the start to finish until we found my perfect dress. She helped me accessorize my dress as well. I recommend David's Bridal and Alex to help anyone looking for their perfect wedding dress. I will be returning to get more accessories and looking forward seeing my Fairy godmother again.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Courtney also helped me accessorize and pick out things I wouldn’t even thought of. She was super positive and a pleasure to work with and really felt one with my wedding party. She made sure I was 100% loving the look and the dress. I can’t wait to go back and have her help my mom pick out a mother of the bride dress. I feel really lucky today after my appointment and it could not have gone better it was absolutely perfect. I really felt like I was at an expensive bridal boutique with out having to drop thousands of dollars to achieve the look that felt the most me. Thank you so much!</review>< Pictures>

Diana and Cailee were very helpful in finding my dress for the big day! Once we found "the one" they broke down all the potential costs of the dress and alterations needed. To make sure the right size dress was ordered they consulted with the head seamstress Karen who was equally helpful. Thanks so much for all who helped!</text>

We had an absolutely wonderful experience shopping for my daughter’s wedding dress. Courtney was friendly, enthusiastic, attentive and passionate. She was a great listener and showed confidence, which helped us trust her judgement. She helped my daughter select dresses that were exactly the look she was after. When my daughter narrowed the dresses down to two, she was very wise and perceptive and asked the right questions to help her decide on the dress that most accurately reflected her style and personality. She made this day so special by making the experience positive, fun, memorable and, most of all, not stressful! There was nothing she could have done to make the experience better. It was the PERFECT day and the PERFECT experience. We decided on the spot that we would request Courtney again when my younger daughter is engaged. Thank you, David’s Bridal! Thank you, Courtney! You have helped make my daughter’s wedding day be magical and beautiful by helping her pick the perfect wedding dress!< /Text>

My older sister bought her sweet sixteen dress here and my aunt bought her wedding dress here. So i followed in their footsteps and bought my sweet sixteen dress here.Courtney helped me pick out my dress and she brought so many beautiful options.She was really nice and helpful
.The dress is picked out was originally a size 14 (which i am not) but it was the one that i fell in love with. Khanh , who altered the dress, was super sweet and patient. She altered it down to my size and it wasn’t little to do. It was done so well that you cant even tell it went through alterations. All the staff was lovely and have helped make my sweet sixteen whole.< /Text>

<text>Made an afternoon first time bridal appointment at the Costa Mesa location. I worked with the stylist Carla and I was very satisfied with her customer service. She is an experienced bridal consultant full of positive energy and charisma. She showed me what I already had in mind for myself, but also introduced me to other styles which actually worked better for my figure. This was my first time trying bridal gowns and Carla made the experience extra special as she was able to envision what I really wanted (even though we were all wearing masks and it’s tougher to show emotions).< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>Amazing team that helped me in my time of need. I had ordered a dress online for an event, but when I received the dress it was even smaller than the previous order. I had booked an appointment in a panic. Not only did the team help me find a dress, they also managed to squeeze me in for alterations so I can have the dress in time for my event. I am forever grateful!!!< /review>< Pics>

Just went to my second alterations appointment with Khanh and she delivered fully to our expectations. The relief of not having to have another set of alterations done was so nice. Truly recommend the entire DB staff as they really have gone out of their way to ensure that my dress was completely stunning especially given the situation I was working with. Great experience all around. Thanks DB for making this experience a great one.< /Text>

<review>The staff at this location is amazing!! I came in to get my dress altered and ended up getting an entirely new dress and everyone was so helpful and accommodating throughout the whole process! I had Anji as my stylist and she was so amazing...she helped me pick out dresses that fit my style and assisted me through the whole trying on process and was super encouraging and supportive but honest and genuine. Even stylists that weren’t assigned to me were coming over and helping and giving their advice. It was such an easy, stress-free, comfortable experience! I would definitely recommend trying on dresses at this location.<//review>< pics>

The Associates at this shop are so incredibly helpful and aim to make each and every bride's dream come true. From my first experience in the shop trying on dresses and finding the right one to the very end of alterations, I could not be happier with my experience shopping for my special day. Khahn and Aida in alterations not only made me feel beautiful and appreciated, but were able to alter my dress in a way that makes both my heels for the ceremony and my boots for the reception look stellar. I can not wait to surprise my husband on our big day, and it was made possible by the David's Bridal team.<//Review>

I was slapped on the hand by Mai Kim, a seamstress who was frustrated that we were unhappy with the alterations done to my girlfriend's dress. Shopping for the dress was great. Everyone in the dress department was more than professional. Alterations however...the work was careless and tacky. When spending more money for alterations than the actual price of the dress, as consumers we want what we paid for. And when choosing to spend over $400 at David's Bridal, when our money could have went somewhere else, we aren't paying to be slapped on the hand by an angry seamstress. Either train the alterations department on how to interact with customers, or they should never interact with customers.<//Review>

The sales manager Vart was extremely helpful on the day of my appointment to find a wedding dress for my special day.  I’m very happy with the outcome and became even more excited about the big day to come.

Mykim and Karen were also excellent with helping to get my dress fitting perfect.  They made arrangements to be able to get the alterations started ASAP, since my big day is just around the corner.  Thank you Mykim, you rock!!! I can’t wait to see the dress at the next fitting.

Overall, my experience was wonderful.  I’m thankful that it all worked out.  ☺️< /text>

<review>This was my first appointment for trying on wedding dresses. Courtney was extremely helpful in getting me to think about various ideas I wouldn’t have thought of on my own. She was great at reminding me of the vision I had walking into the store and was conscious of my budget. Courtney was not only personable but I was comfortable right from the start.  I’m a pretty laid back person so having someone who wasn’t overwhelming was exactly what I needed. I would highly recommend booking an appointment with Courtney.</review>< Rating>

<text>I went in yesterday just to start trying on wedding dresses to get an idea of what I like and fits my shape well. I ended up leaving with my dream dress thanks to Carla. She taught me the fundamentals of wedding dress shopping/alterations which I was completely unaware of. She listened to what I liked, helped narrow down my options, and in the end grabbed a dress off the clearance rack that was a beautiful beaded A-line dress that I fell in love with. I didn't like the high-neck and she worked with me and the alterations staff to see if it would be possible to alter it into a strapless. The whole team there were very sweet and were able to help me get the dress I was envisioning. Thank you!!< /text>< Resp>

<Time>1604536724754< /Time><text>Had a terrible experience at my dress fitting. Ordered a dress and sized up and it still came a little too snug in my bust. I went to the fitting and the lady told me “this dress has no extra material and I don’t have any of that material here so there is nothing I can do”. I would have been completely open to using an accent material to give more space but she told me she couldn’t help me. Instead she asked me why I even ordered that dress and told me to find a new one. She asked who told me to buy the dress and again told me to find a new one. She was really unhelpful and was not even willing to attempt to find a solution. I will be going elsewhere to have the dress altered and won’t be buying another from there.<//text></record>

Today I joined my mom on her quest to find her wedding dress. Her stylist was Anji. I can't give Anji enough praise! She was so extremely helpful and knowledgeable. She was too good at her job; she pulled so many great options for my mom that it was hard to pick just one favorite. We were able to narrow it down with Anji's help and found the ONE!

We waited about 10 minutes before we started looking through the dresses while many stylists were running around. About another 10 minutes we started pulling dresses off the rack to try on. Finally, 40 minutes after we arrived they finally asked if we had been helped. We said no and the person took off another few minutes went by and we were asked if we needed help. I said we haven’t been helped at all. She asked our name and saw that we checked in 45 minutes ago.

The salesperson took the dresses and took us to a dressing room and said the stylist would be coming. Well my daughter tried on two dresses before Tammy came to help. She said she wanted to measure her to see her size but never did. My daughter had picked out 5 dresses to try on and she hardly helped us. Tammy did bring 3 more dresses when we asked her to. Finally narrowed it down to 2 dresses when Tammy stuck around.

What was supposed to be an hour appointment turned into 2 due to lack of help. I noticed that brides were even left hanging and waiting for help.

I honestly could not recommend shopping at David’s Bridal in Costa Mesa.<//Text><Time>1605393213948<//Time><GmapID>0x80dcdf39820ccf1d:0x418e1dde81487a7d<//GmapID><Name>Brenda Haney</Name>< rate>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>You need to ASK FOR RAYMOND!! I'm absolutely in awe of his talent as a stylist. I am SO picky when it comes to dresses and I'm super indecisive - basically the worst client imaginable. Raymond told me that 80% of his clients end up finding their wedding dress within the first three they try on. I thought "that would never happen with me" since I'm so picky. I ended up buying the 3rd dress I tried on!!! Not only did he find me THE dress within 10 minutes, but found me shoes and a veil without exceeding my budget. I was really SO impressed. My fiancé and I have been together for 8 years and engaged for 2 years. Yesterday morning we decided to run away to Vegas this weekend and just elope, and have a big wedding later after COVID ends. So, I needed a dress FAST, and also wanted to keep it super inexpensive since we're just eloping. I'm astonished that Raymond was able to keep all this in mind and find me the perfect dress that looked beautiful, fit my style, fit me PERFECTLY (no tailoring needed), and well within budget! Thank you Raymond for completely taking away the stress of finding an affordable, beautiful dress with such short notice!!</review><Name>Elizabeth Shen< /Name>< pics>

I had a great experience picking out the wedding dress of my dreams! The staff was so helpful and patient with me as I tried on 10 different dresses only to chose the first one I tried. They worked with me and my timeline. And my dress was ready in less then 2 weeks, in time for the wedding! I just picked up my tailored dress and I still love it. No second guessing here, David's Bridal was the right choice.<//Review>

I had my alterations appointment today. Khanh, the woman doing my alterations, was wonderful! I was a little worried when my dress didn’t fit, but she reassured me and patiently got all the appropriate measurements. She was super kind and a pleasure to work with. I feel good leaving my dress in her hands. She said she has been working for the company for over 15 years! She’s amazing and David’s Bridal is so lucky to have her. Thank you, Khanh.<//Text>

Carla helped me today and she was absolutely amazing. This was my first experience shopping for a wedding dress and she was informative and answered all of my questions. She didn’t try to persuade or push me. She worked with my budget and has a positive attitude. I recommend you ask for Carla. She was sweet and helpful. Made me feel like a beautiful bride.<//Text>

Carla was my dress specialist and she was superb. I went in with not the greatest of hope to find a dress for a November wedding but after a few minutes of talking I was at ease and fell into the groove of love it or lose it. After trying on a couple dresses I had pinned. The last dress was the one and I was in love 🥰. Carla made me feel so relaxed and at ease and no pressure to buy but I knew this was the dress. If you come to this store ask for Carla you will not be disappointed. I’ll be asking for her when we go to look for outfits for my mom.<//Text>

Makayla was the best stylist for my special day. She was patient, knowledgeable, friendly, & efficient. She listened to what details I liked. Thanks to her she helped me purchase my wedding dress on my 1st day shopping! Although I spent the day shopping 🛍 from OC to LA, I ended up returning to David’s Bridal to get the 3rd dress that Maykala brought to my dressing room- it was just so stunning & fit my personality! Thank you so much Makayla for making this experience so much fun & enjoyable for my family & I!!</Review>

Quick and efficient. Perfect fit. The seamstress suggested to have it longer in the hem in the back of my gown and at the final fitting the hem in the back flowed elegantly. Very happy with the service, reminders and promptness.<//Text>

I had Jenny as a consultant and she went above and beyond to find the perfect dress for me. I didn’t really know what I was looking for, but she was able to work miracles and help me find the perfect dress. I highly recommend you making an appointment online, bring your two VIPs, and let them work their magic!!</text>< pics>

<Text>Oh my goodness!! I had such an amazing experience at David’s Bridal, my stylist Miss Carla was the absolute best human being in the world. I wish I could just have her by my side all day everyday! I felt guilty because I had bought a dress just a couple hours before my appt at David’s and she totally read me. She knew something was up when I wasn’t very excited about the dresses I was trying on and when I told her and showed her the dress I got she was so gracious and supportive. We all need that kind of support and love in our lives. The dresses there were beautiful and the service was exceptional! I don’t regret going in even though I already had my dress. Go, ask for Miss Carla and have an absolutely amazing time!!! Much love!!!</Text>< pictures>

<Review>I went to this location 2 days ago with my friend the Bride to be and a few bridesmaids to try on dresses. During our visit, there were 2 other brides in the store and their small parties at least 30ft or more away. We could only see one party because the other one was on the other side of the store. While we were trying on dresses we were coming out, temporarily taking off our masks just to take pictures while remaining in OUR section right outside the dressing rooms so we could send the pictures to the other bridesmaids who couldn't make it. Our stylist was nice but seemed super busy, she would leave for long periods of time and only came back a couple times to check in on us. Everything was going great until an employee with blonde hair (not the one who was originally helping us) rudely walked through our section not to offer us help or to check in on us but just tell us to put our masks back on and walked away before we could respond. My friend panicked and put her mask back on like she had gotten us in trouble and risked getting us all kicked out. How is it ok that our party can sit together inside a restaurant without masks but we can't be in our private section at David's Bridal and temporarily take off our masks just to take pictures without being scolded by an employee? Can't say if this was coming from upper management or just the employee. Either way this isn't how customers should be treated when they are looking to spend hundreds of dollars on dresses at your business. I ended up buying my dress elsewhere because of the bad service.<//Review>< response>

It was my first time trying on dresses and I am the kind of person who has to look at every option there is, read all the reviews, take photos, sleep on it, look up more options and then try it on again.....this was NOT my experience yesterday! I walked in hesitant and very nervous because I had no idea what I wanted even slightly. An angel named Nicci appeared and I told her I knew nothing at all and that I was just starting to get ideas. She was so attentive, extremely patient and so so sweet.  I only tried on 5 dresses and each one grew better than the previous. She was listening and paying attention. I told her what I loved and didn't from each dress. By the 4th dress she was really close and then she asked me to use my imagination and give something a chance! It was PERFECT! I knew it was my dress before I even looked in a mirror. The reaction of all 8 of my friends and family the minute I walked out of the dressing room said it all.
Nicci was not pushy at all. Never made me feel like I was just another sale, she was genuine and so so good at what she does. Im obsessed and still havent come down from cloud 9!!
Ahhhh!!! I found the most amazing dress ever! It feels like it was made just for me. And the price was 1/4 of what I was expecting to pay!!!<//review><rating>5< /rating>< date>

We’re planning a wedding within three months of being engaged. I foolishly scheduled wedding dress shopping too close to the wedding day, where Carla had promised to help me then. She was there for me when finding a dress for one of my bridesmaids and she shared with me such wisdom about being selfFULL verses being selFISH.

Well, I call today about checking on other bridesmaids dresses and Michelle answers and is amazing and helps me realize I need to reschedule sooner.Thank goodness! I was able to book same day with Michelle and called my team about the rescheduled dress appointment.

I arrived early because I am freaking out. I am scared I won’t find the dress plus I didn’t have time to do my hair and my stomach was upset.

Thank goodness Raymond was assigned to assist me in finding my dress. He met me at the entrance and I was frozen in fear about this whole thing. He helped me take deep breaths and reassured me that “the worst thing that will happen is you walk out of here with a white dress.” I trusted him to take care of me.

And! Good news! I also had the store manager Mizene help me and oh my gosh it was like everything just fell into place.

I had my team there with me, my Mom, Sister and my Maid of Honor and bridesmaid to help me choose the dress. Mizene helped find the styles I chose beforehand and grabbed everything I needed to start this dress journey. She made me feel normal and that everything was going to be okay. It was immediately fun when I started trying on dresses. I was not scared anymore but I was still worried, “will I find THE dress?”

The first one was elegant and lovely but just not practical and not looking the best on me. My team confirmed let’s come back to it.

I try on the next one and it is easy, it is light and I twirled as soon as I opened the dressing door to my team and I lit up. It is THE dress!

Then! Mizene AND Raymond have me close my eyes and they dressed me with the details of decorations and Raymond guided me to the imagery of when I will see my husband-to-be at the altar and I am filled with tears. My team is sniffling and it’s beautiful what Raymond leads me through as my eyes are closed and Mizene and him are dressing me in accents.

Then Raymond says to open my eyes and I am speechless.

I am thinking about my wedding day and seeing my love and thinking of what he will see when his eyes find mine.

I am overtaken by beauty in that moment.

Everything is right in the world.

Raymond, Mizene, Michelle, and Carla, thank you!

You have no idea the impact you made on me tonight.

If you have read my note up until now, that means you need to go visit this location and ask for Mizene, Raymond, Carla or Michelle. Everyone is the best at their gift in finding you the dress. You’re in good hands here.< /review>

<text>Carla was absolutely wonderful! She removed all of the pressure and really made the experience extraordinary! I went by myself because I struggle with too many opinions and she was honest and constructive. Almost immediately she got a sense of who I was as and my style. Such an incredible experience and I can’t wait to bring my daughter in for a fitting as well with Carla!
Thank you for being so wonderful and accommodating! Even with all of the necessary COVID-19 precautions in place, it was a wonderful experience!</text>< Pics>

Courtney was amazing, yet I was never shown the clearance isle. When I found it at the end of my appointment I found THE DRESS. However after getting it home it showed signs of being worn, buttons on back were missing and the buttons were dirty after closely looking at things.
Discounted or not I have to say especially during COVID, the dress was NEVER cleaned when it was returned and I was rushed out after my one hour appointment.
The alteration process, took a whole other turn, it cost almost the same as the Discounted dirty dress to alter the dress to fit my body type.
I took the dress to an alteration place nearby that was a huge fraction of the cost of DB. Wow. Honestly, I would never do this again and don't recommend 2nd marriages going here. All 3 of my girls are buying their bride's maids dresses here, and want to buy their wedding dresses on day in the future but Honestly,  I can't recommend David's Bridal. I don't need to be up sold, I'm in sales, I  get it but please gave clean, put together items.</Text>

Trying on wedding dresses here is everything they say it is. Especially here (& with Carla!). She went out of her way to find me a dress I, personally, would fall in love with while respecting my budget and not pushing me. She found me exactly what I was looking for and she even let me stay a little past the appointment so I could make a decision. She was positive and loving; I left feeling beautiful and like a bride. Not to mention, the whole service staff was well attentive, congratulated me on the upcoming wedding, and was so unbelievably pleasant. Thank you David’s!< /Review>

This David's Bridal is huge! It has everything you would need for a wedding and probably at the best price compared to all the wedding boutiques. It also has a huge selection of wedding dresses for all types of brides and wedding. I didn't see much for the grooms or groomsmen, but there are some choices for the mothers and flower girls. We didn't have a reservation when we came through the door, but they took us in anyway. They did mention that we were lucky that time, so maybe make a reservation for dress shopping here. They were super nice to us when I was shopping for my wedding dress (and without a reservation), but after I bought the dress, accessories, and bridesmaids dresses, they weren't as enthusiastic or approachable. They were minimally courteous, but were obviously more interested in making new sales. But overall, we had what we needed and the wedding happened, so we all lived happily ever after.</Review>

The wait was long. service was very poor, selection of wedding dresses was limited not much to pick from and the few that were there seem old and dirty, as for the sales associate she show very little interest in assisting, she was pretty much off helping others, we might as well have been given the option of shopping without a sales associate. Would we recommend this location NO.</text>

I had a great experience at David's Bridal mainly due to our wonderful stylist, Yadira Tenorio. I came in with only a vague idea of what I had wanted, and she was able to ask the right questions and find the right look for me. She was also an amazing person for putting up with my family and I asking for so much and running around for all of our requests. I am very thankful for her assistance in finding my wedding dress and my bridesmaid's dress.<//text>

Even amidst the pandemic everyone at DB was so helpful, kind and you could tell they were smiling under their masks! Huge shoutout to our stylist Carla who brought so much happiness, knowledge, energy and passion to help me find my dream dress. She definitely made the day even better than we imagined for me and my family!<//text>

First time trying on a wedding dress was overwhelming but my consultant, Karen was lovely and patient. She took time to know me and my style. Though I didn't find my dress then, I walked out feeling confident in coming back for a 2nd fitting. I visited the Metro Pointe outlet. It was clean and well maintained. Thanks DB!<//Review>

<Text>I bought my wedding dress with Kambria she was amazing, helped me find my perfect princess dress and she was so nice to me and to my family.
My alterations assistant was Khanh she was also fantastic so personal and made sure that the dress fit me perfectly and accentuated all of my beauty, she was also very nice with my family and helped my sister in law get familiar with my dress so she could help me get ready on my wedding day.
Thank you so much David’s bridal team I can’t wait to wear my perfect dress on my special day!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf39820ccf1d:0x418e1dde81487a7d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I went in today to find a bridesmaids dress and considering we’re still in the midst of a pandemic I understood certain measures of social distancing would be respected. But unfortunately once we were in the fitting room area it seemed as tho every room was filled back to back, multiple people standing next to each other when the entire other half of the store and fitting rooms were empty. I can’t remember for the life of me who my stylist was but she was great she recommended options, she gave her opinion, she was polite and genuine. But with all of those people cramped everything seemed so rushed. I was there with my cousin who is the bride she tried 3 dresses on and was over the whole experience she felt rushed and there was just too much chaos. We left with out purchasing anything.< /Text>

I can't thank David's Bridal Costa Mesa and their associate Angie who went above & beyond in helping me find an emergency bridesmaid dress with the wedding only 9 days away! She was very patient and accommodating and I left with a beautiful dress and a lot less stress.< /review>

I walked in to the store on Saturday afternoon prior to New Year with one of my bridesmaids to try on bridesmaid dresses. Although the store was super busy, Dori was very helpful to bring out different styles in the correct size. Since my other bridesmaids have come to the store and selected their dresses before, I was able to make the order on the same day I walked in. Originally I was planning to make the purchase online, but the estimated arrival time is way too long as some of my orders are out of stock online and needs to preorder. My wedding is in early February but the preorder would take 3 months to make, which means I would not get them until late March. I was so stressed out when I saw that. So I called the store and they are actually able to get those dresses for me in late January. So glad that I called the store!!!! Definitely recommending to check out the dresses in person and make the purchase there. You might get more discounts in store ;)<//review>

I just have to say i have been here twice and both times Stephanie helped me and my bridesmaids. She is amazing made it a great experience.
Previously visited Davids Bridal in Brea and that was a horrible experience.
If you want a sales person to help you here at Costa Mesa ask for Stephanie, loved her!!!
Thanks girl.</review>

<Text>I am extremely happy with my purchase and overall experience. My sales rep Yadira was very friendly and it was her dress that I ended up choosing. She really listened to what I wanted. I needed my dress in 4 weeks, so I ended up purchasing the floor model, which was in great condition. The  dress was clean and fit perfectly. Theresa in alterations was so sweet! She knows her stuff! My dress was the perfect fit and length! Thank you to the entire team for making my experience at David's bridal so memorable. Everyone was so attentive and made sure my needs were met. Thank you! My husband loved my dress! Photos taken by  Klo Eng Photography.< /Text>< Pictures>

I needed to find an elopement dress STAT just a month before my courthouse wedding. Courtney was positive, energetic, super in tune with my style and aesthetic. I seriously I had so much fun. She made me feel majestic, like a bride unicorn. I love you Courtney! Thanks David’s Bridal.</review>< pictures>

My experience at David's Bridal was absolutely amazing. It was the first and only place I went to try on wedding dresses for my Joshua Tree Elopement. I had Carla as my stylist and she was the nicest, most supportive stylist I could have asked for. She was so sweet and I don't think my experience would've been the same without her. My mom lives on the East Coast and even without her there it felt like someone was taking care of me the way she would have because of Carla! I literally LOVED her and would recommend her to anyone!< /review>

My stylist Jamie is what made the experience so wonderful for me. She cared about my needs and asked me about my life. She was genuinely excited about this chapter in my life and wanted to help me find the perfect dress. I felt comfortable and confident. It was a last-minute decision for me to just go and I was so tired due to having a baby at home. She normalized the situation and helped me feel excited regardless whether I was tired and by myself it was a special time. Also Mizine the store manager was amazing she got me the perfect Veil and shoes while Jamie was grabbing me another size dress. They don't act like your burden and they really care about what you need and want. Fiona helped Jamie at the register and she had a big smile on her face and was so attentive and nice. Thank you for making this experience beautiful for me.<//review>

<Date>1593886637808<//Date><Rate>4</Rate><Review>At least for me, the process of finding a wedding dress at David's Bridal in Costa Mesa was a breeze. My 2 friends and I checked in, was asked to look for options on the racks, then met with the stylist for fitting. I almost bought the first dress that I tried on because it fit so well and was about right. Fortunately, I asked my stylist, David, to look through my Favorites list and find the dress that I made my mission to try on. The dress was a Size 4 which is a size and a half more than my normal, but you know they say wedding dresses are made to be smaller or more fitting. The dress felt like a Size 2 which was perfect, comfort wise. My personal problem is my petite build so I definitely have to get the length altered. Nevertheless, it turned out great and I ended up purchasing it on the spot. It was my first bridal store and instance of dress shopping. Now, the biggest to-do on any wedding planning is done. The rest is smooth sailing!

As far as this store/branch, I would say that the overall experience was OK+. I wish there were more dress selections on the floor to try on and that I was able to try on everything or 50% on my Favorites list. They were only able to pull 1 or 2 due to time constraints. Each bride at the store was only allotted 1 hour of shopping, fitting, and twirling to decide on the "perfect" dress. It was definitely not a "Say Yes to the Dress" experience, the fitting rooms were small, I wish they had a small bench to rest or put my things down while getting inside the dress. The stylists don't seem as engaged or passionate about their service, I think that has to do with the time constraint and getting as many brides in & out as possible while also making some sale. I wish I did have more time to look at the mirror and twirl around so I can make a connection with each dress I tried on. Searching for a dress during COVID-19 also played an important role in the experience.

In the end, they make you hold a bouquet, which is kind of cute, and ring a bell... which was not. I thought it was tacky. Overall, it definitely felt like a chain store rather than a personalized bridal experience... which is expected. I am happy with my purchase though, I ended up with a Vera Wang dress for $600. I'd say that trumps over any nuisance brought by COVID-19 and rushed shopping timeline ❤<//Review>< Pictures>

I tried on so many dresses and then retried on the ones that I liked so many time. I had a ton of questions and she was ready to help answer all of them. I found my dress and I feel so good about it thanks to all of her help. Thank you so much Jocelyn for taking the time to make sure that I was absolutely in love with my dress for my big day!

We found a beautiful flower girl dress for our grand daughter. Everyone was very helpful. The only complaint I have is that the dress I called to see if they had and made a reservation for they didn’t have when I got there. Found something else a bit more expensive though.<//Text>

<review>The staff here is amazing and so helpful! Carla helped me find my perfect dress! I swore up and down that I did not want a strapless dress but she encouraged me to try things out of my comfort zone. When I found my perfect dress I actually ended up having the straps removed to make it strapless! Carla is a true professional and is so wonderful and supportive on finding the perfect dress for every bride. You can really tell that she loves what she does and it shines through in her spirit with every interaction. I cant thank Carla enough, she truly made my dress experience as wonderful as I could have ever hoped for.

I had my alterations done with Patricia. She was kind and explained everything she would need to do to make the dress exactly what I wanted. I had cap sleeves that I wanted removed and she explained exactly how she would need to tweak the front a bit so the shape didnt get weird. I picked up my dress tonight and I was so happy! It was exactly what I wanted! She did a wonderful job on the bustle and walking my mom through each step to show her exactly how to do it.

I am so appreciative to the entire team for such a friendly warm experience.  Would definitely recommend to other brides!</review>< pics>

<review>The sales Associate Cheree helped my daughter pick out a beautiful dress for her Debutante debut.  David's Bridal had a great selection of dresses and many in my daughter's size so she could try them on.  Cheree was professional,  informative, and extremely helpful.  She explained many important aspects such as ordering a size up and the time frame it would take to get each dress. She made our experience at Dave's Bridal a 5 star!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>I went to try on bridesmaid dresses for my friend’s wedding. The appointment experience was easy and comfortable. I’m pretty picky about clothes in general and know what does and does not look good on me. My stylist Jamie “got” my style right away and picked several options that I loved, and I actually ended up noting down some of the dresses I didn’t pick as potential options for my own bridesmaids...everything you like can be connected to your online account. Alterations are also available on site which is convenient.

Only thing I didn’t like was how crowded the dressing area got when multiple parties were trying on dresses all at once - you’re kind of elbow to elbow around the mirrors and bumping into each other, but that’s to be expected with a big chain store, and I would assume those shopping for wedding gowns vs bridesmaid dresses receive a more personalized experience in comparison.</text>< Pics>

My experience at David’s Bridals in Costa Mesa was definitely praiseworthy. The employees, especially my stylist Jenny, were so helpful and friendly. Jenny shined as she brought me dress after dress that was according to my tastes. When I finally found THE dress, it was so much fun to make a wish and ring the bell. I can’t wait for my follow up with my bridesmaids! I would highly recommend David’s Bridals to any bride searching for something special on the most special of days.

My second trip to David’s Bridal was so much fun. I brought most of my bridal party to find dresses, and our stylist Sam R was wonderful. She shuffled dresses like a pro and was able to find the perfect one for each of my bridesmaids.  We were a complicated bunch, and Sam worked so hard to make us happy with our choices. Thank you David’s Bridal for making shopping for my wedding so memorable!<//text>

< Review>
I purchased a flower girl dress for my daughter March 2020 for a wedding she was supposed to be in April 2020. Due to COVID-19 the wedding has been cancelled and the store has been closed. I totally understand why the store has been closed and is currently still closed. HOWEVER I was informed by an associate that once the store reopens I have 15 days to return the dress for a full refund (Mind you the dress was delivered to the Costa Mesa store, I’m not in possession of it) . I called today and was informed by the store manager Miaze (not sure of the correct spelling of her name) that , that was the policy but now it has changed to only given store credit. I have no use for a store credit with David’s bridal. I’m not getting married, my daughter is no longer in a wedding, I don’t need the dress so why not issue my refund that is owed to me? How is this good business? This is not fair at all and I have ill feelings towards them now and definitely will tell everyone about my experience. I understand you are a business and you’re not trying to lose money but imagine being a single mother of 3 , scrapping up $150 to buy a dress for your daughter to be in a wedding that is now longer happening and being told you will get a refund to now store credit. Not fair at all. I want my refund that is owed to me. HONOR YOUR ORIGINAL POLICY< /Review>

<review>I can't speak any more highly of the service we received at David's Bridal from Haniah! She is an absolute gem! She listened to all of our special requests, and was relentless in helping find just the right dress. I was exhausted from the experience, but she stayed high-energy, sympathetic, and was super engaged in the entire process! Besides she had a the gift of being able to listen to the requests and marry that with the energy the bride-to-be displayed when she was wearing the dress. She had excellent taste :).
Make sure you ask for her on your visit to David's Bridal at Costa Mesa!</review>< pictures>

I originally gave this store 5 stars, but unfortunately I have to edit it now.  I purchased a rose gold belt that had long strings to tie to go with my dress.  When I went in for alterations, I was told they could sew the belt to my dress so that it didn’t sag when I put it on.  I agreed and it was decided that we would leave the strings on, because I liked the way the dress looked with a bow in the back.  Well, when I picked up my dress, they had sewn the belt on but cut the strings off!! I was upset,  but there was nothing they could do at that point so I decided not to worry about it.  Fast forward a couple of weeks to my wedding day...I've just put my dress on...it fits like a glove and the belt looks very nice.  But not even ten minutes later, the belt completely fell off on the right side.  The sewing had somehow come undone, and without the strings, I couldn’t tie it.  My photographer was able to tie the torn loop around it but it only held for about 20 minutes.  At that point, there was nothing to do but safety pin it.  I had to go through the ceremony, photos, and reception with a giant safety pin in my dress and if they hadn’t cut the strings off the belt, it wouldn’t have been a problem.  So, the dress was beautiful and fit perfectly,  but they ignored my request to keep the ties on the belt and it ended up being a big issue.  I paid for a service, didn’t get what I asked for, and it caused a problem.  2 stars.<//review>

We cane in today to shop for bridesmaids and mother of the bride dresses. Everyone was very accommodating and professional. The only negative part of the day was the amount of people they had in the building. Other than that, I’d recommend this David’s bridal for any future brides.< /Text>

My experience with David's Bridal I had 11AM appointment I had to find someone to tell me to look around which I had already done. I knew what I wanted already. I got brought to a dressing room and was told if I needed anything let them know. Bottom line I walked and they got no sale from me.< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience at David’s Bridal alteration. Karen & Neda were very helpful & made me feel comfortable. They were very thorough with measurements so I will look my very best in my gown. Overall, I left feeling truly confident of myself & happy. Kudos to both of you. Keep up the good work & excellent service.<//Text>

I would request her if you need alterations done to your gown because she is very skilled at what she does and will do her best to make sure the bride is happy.

<text>The online scheduling via chat took 20 minutes while I waited for someone to get online.  There was no time estimation so I didn't know if the app stalled or anything.  That's my online complaint. Once I got the appointment, I had a very pleasant and successful appointment with my daughters looking for their graduation and prom dresses.  The manager who helped me was very friendly and patient.  I was shocked to have found something for both occasions. I would definitely recommend this store.  There was a lot of variety and sizes.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>David’s Bridal is a great place to get your dresses and alterations! I’ve gone with friends for their wedding dresses and for bridesmaids dresses for myself, and always been offered help by the employees. I recently went for an alteration, and Neda did a fantastic job at making me feel comfortable and giving me the best advice for what my dress needed. It is always clean and relaxing when I head into David’s Bridal at Metro Pointe! It can be a little bit pricey, but you get what you pay for in quality dresses and service!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Went to David's Bridal last year to find my wedding dress. My family and I had such an amazing time. Jenna helped me find my dream dress. She was wonderful! She took the time to listen to my vision. After trying on a variety of beautiful dresses I said YES to the DRESS.<//Text>

<text>I had the greatest experience at this location on 10/5/2019. The service Stephanie B. provided couldn't have been better. I found a dress I loved and said yes! However, the dress I tried on was NOT the dress I picked up. The straps on the dress were completely different than the straps on the dress I tried on. After trying it on upon pick-up, I asked the manager about the strap situation. She very nicely explained the dresses that are "plus" do sometimes have differences for example the straps on this one were wider since the size I ordered was a "plus size".  You would think they would tell me that BEFORE I purchased the dress, but they didn't.  This upset me to a point where I actually wound up going back in January and actually finding a completely different dress.  This time, making sure everything was going to arrive as expected and it did. Luckily, I hadn't done any alterations or even removed the tags from the first dress, so I was able to do the exchange seamlessly!
I picked up my new dress in February and it is just everything I could dream of and more. The consultant David who helped me find the one was so great and was so helpful. Also, HUGE shout out to the sales manager Kaitlyn Carney for also helping me with my new purchase.  I didn't want to remove stars from my review because of David and Kaitlyn. They deserve all the stars and some.  If I had any advice to anyone who is coming here or to any David's Bridal, just make sure you're getting what you think you are! It totally sucks when you think you're getting something and it arrives completely different!<//text>< UserId.>

I had my alterations done by MyKim. She was AWESOME! She was very friendly and made the experience great. She explained what exactly she would be doing in detail, which helped ease the alteration process! I made sure she would be working when I try on my finished dress!

Update: I just picked up my wedding dress today and my final fitting went perfect. MyKim did an AMAZING job with my alterations! The dress fits me like a glove and it's absolutely perfect!

<review>Carla is awesome! I went in with a heavy heart to find a "backup" dress. I had previously purchased and ordered my wedding dress from another store, however it was not going to arrive on time. Walking into David's Bridal, Carla was all energy & positivity! After explaining my situation she brought me out of my nervousness & found me a beautiful dress! 10/10 reccomend speaking to Carla for ALL your wedding needs!
Update: for all alterations ask for Mykim! My dress has beautiful layers, yet short girl problems it needs to be hemmed. Mykim said no problem! Dress looks amazing! 100% ask for Mykim for your alterations!<//review><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

OMG.... this was an amazing experience.  Sadly,  this is my second wedding (definately my last) and i had such a great experience.  Courtney P at the South Coast metro location was amazing. During the unprecedented times were living in,  I felt comfortable,  protected, and space respected.  I brought my mom (arthritic hands) and my 6yr old son so i needed help with some zipping... she helped me twist and turn to get zipped.  She was helpful,  kind, and gave me the gentle nudge to pick out the perfect dress for my day.  The conversation was a blessing, I felt heard,  understood, and calm making a big decision. She was patient but didn't let me hmmm and haw about trying to please others.  I can't wait to pick up my dress and hope that she will be there when i go. Definately recommend Courtney and the bridal experience i had at David's Bridal.< /Text>

<review>I was extremely disappointed in the customer service recently as the team showed minimal regard to a sensitive situation. My mom has decided to choose a new dress for my sisters wedding that is a month away because she will now be walking my sister down the aisle since my dad is now on hospice and will not be with us for the wedding. After explaining this when I came in yesterday evening, I found a dress my mom felt was perfect for this and in her size and asked if they could make an exception to their hold policy, and hold it at least one more day if not the rest of the week. It's unpredictable when my mom could get down there to try it on as my dad needs 24/7 care. The manager did not seem to care in the slightest about this situation and continuously repeated my policy is that it goes back on the sales floor at closing. You would think in a sensitive situation as explained they would pull a simple favor, but they would not. They were not even willing to help me get creative how we can figure this out. I called the Ontario store this morning and they have the same dress in the same size and without even going into as much detail with my dads situation, they agreed to hold it until she can get down there to try it on, considering the situation.

After partnering with this store and building multiple wedding parties look with their staff, I was highly disappointed in their lack of regard for my situation and I will not return to the Costa Mesa location regardless of their high selection of dresses. Customer service should always be valued over sales and policOntario will be my new go to store.< /review><Time>1565808743005< /Time><user_id>110457208692981677616< /user_id><resp>{'time': 1565998297530, 'text': "Hello Elizabeth, thank you so much for reaching out to us, we completely understand your disappointment in us.

< review>
I had an appointment and arrived a few minutes before my scheduled time. I was told to look around and my stylist would be with me very shortly.   I looked around, grabbed some items to try on and ended up holding approximately 15 heavy dresses and pantsuits. Employees were walking around doing their own thing, it was clearly not a busy time at 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon, maybe 3 different customers which I noticed. One of them being a bride who was receiving all of the attention in the store, gotta make that sale!!! Anyways, I finally couldn't carry anymore and had to ask if someone could take these for me so I could try them on.  She walks me back to the fitting area, which by the way has NO mirrors inside the dressing room, you must come out in front of everyone else and see how each item looks, I thought that was quite odd!! Still no help, nobody even as much asked me if I am doing ok or if I need anything NOTHING!! I continued trying everything on with absolutely NO help with zipping the dresses up, etc... I wouldn't recommend this type of service to anyone!! Not a good way to make or keep repeat customers.  Very disappointed and needless to say, although I did like a couple of the items, i did not hand over my hard earned money, simply because of the service I did NOT receive!!< /review>

<Review>David's Bridal allowed me to exchange everything I purchased last year. It was devastating at first when I thought I had wasted money on something that fell through. I'm getting married this year to the love of my life and now I will have the most perfect wedding dress, crown and veil, thanks to David's Bridal for working a miracle for me! Thank you so much for all your help today. You guys are amazing and I am so truly grateful for you!</Review>< Response>

Did not have appointment so was told someone would help me when available. I tried on 3 mother of the bride dresses without any help. One lady did say she would go get dress in smaller size for me, waited 15 to 20 minutes never brought dress back. I was disappointed in how I was treated compared to another mother of the bride shop I was in.
Prices fair maybe would be better treated if had appointment . The future brides trying on dresses seemed happy. Didnt find anything i liked do not plan any return trips.< /Review>

<Review>I went to get a mother of the bride dress for my daughters wedding. I found the dress I really liked, but they didn’t have my size. They told me could order it and it would be delivered to their store so I could pick it up. When I went to pick it up, it was the wrong size, I didn’t realize it until after the service. I just kept saying the dress was still so big. So check your sizes before you leave the store!<//Review><user>115857259518847620568< /user><Rating>3< /Rating>< username>

Service was bad. My mom had to go get herself a chair to sit down because the lady never got her one. My stylist was hesitant to help me change into the dresses so my mom has to help me. Her knowledge was limited. No space to see myself in the mirror. No privacy. After trying on one dress I just wanted to leave early my appointment because the environment was stressful.< /Review>

<review>Nicci was the one that helped me throughout my whole appointment today and I couldn’t have asked for anyone better to take me through this experience. I had no idea what to expect. I was afraid and anxious and nervous to be honest when I first walked in, but she made it so comfortable and easy to go through. I didn’t get rushed or pushed into buying the dress. So accommodating and professional and yet friendly enough to where I didn’t feel awkward to be my silly self. She definitely set a high standard for anybody else that I get to work with. Oh! And Thank you so much for helping me pick out my beautiful wedding dress!!</review>< userid>

Chenee was so wonderful. I 100% didn’t think I’d get a wedding dress today, I thought oh I’ll try on styles and see what fits look good on me. Then when I go to boutiques I can give more direction on what I liked. Didn’t expect to fall in love with a dress. But did! Chenee was the best, so patient and had a excellent eye, every dress she pulled I would have picked myself. Overall great experience.</review>

<Review>Our stylist was low energy, we had to pull our own dresses and had to ask her to pull other dresses when changing. We had a party of 3 for bridesmaids and 2 flower girls and was told we only had 1 fitting room. I was hoping for this to be a memorable experience. My daughter flew in from out of state to experience this important time for me. I felt like I was shopping at a department store.  I was very disappointed with my experience.<//Review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

I went to this location for my very first bridal dress appointment, and I was lucky enough to find my perfect dress in no time! The store itself was very spacious and I never felt crammed, nor did I feel overwhelmed with all the options. The staff there was super sweet, especially the girl that was helping me out, Emily. I bought my dress that day after getting some sound advice from Emily and the manager, I believe her name was Jessica. They made it easy for me to be comfortable in buying the dress that I knew I really wanted.

The only reason I give this store 4 stars instead of 5 is due to my second experience at this store. I went back 3 days after I bought my wedding dress, and that was to look at some bridesmaids dresses with my girls. The staff I had was totally different and I did not feel welcomed like I had on my first trip there. We were not given much of any direction on the bridesmaids dresses, and the girl that was helping us talked to softly that I couldn't hear anything she was saying. Nothing against her, she was also very nice, but it was like pulling teeth trying to ask any questions that day.

My first trip was on a Friday morning, my second trip was a Monday morning. I'm not sure if that made any difference since it didn't seem much busier on Friday while I was there. All in all, I found my dress and loved the girls that helped me that Friday!< /review>

I scheduled an appointment with Diana while attending the Bridal Expo in Costa Mesa. After the expo I decided to drop into the store just to glance around before my big bridal party arrived at the end of the month. While there I was greeted with warm smiles and friendly faces, particularly that of Kaitlyn C. who was very accommodating to me and my maid of honor. She assisted us without an appointment, dedicating her time and attention to us in order to try on dresses, order accessories and even going the extra mile to ensure I received the items in a timely manner for my photo shoot. I can’t wait to arrive with my bridal party, I’m certain the experience will be even better with a scheduled appointment lol. Thank you for the awesome “pre-Yes to the dress” experience.< /Text>

Everyone was professional, courteous and helpful from beginning to end.  My consultant was Theresa G. and she, along with her manager, went beyond a 5 star service.  There are two Theresa's so make sure you request for Theresa G.  She not only took care of me, but made sure my daughter and friends were taken care of in ensuring they had seats during my appointment.  I was able to try on all of the dresses I wanted to and she was there to help on any and all capacities.  Theresa G. has a great, fun personality and a lot of energy to keep the dresses coming.  I never felt rushed and she didn't stop until I found my perfect dress.  When I had found the one she did a special ceremony that made me feel so special.  I was at the appointment with my teenage daughter and two dear friends and we were all in tears during that fun time.  Want to know what the ceremony is.........well you'll just have to go to David's Bridal, meet with Theresa G. to find out.  Brides, David's Bridal in Long Beach is the place to get your wedding dress and Theresa G. is the consultant to work with!!!<//Text>< pics>

I bought my dress and had my alterations done at the Costa Mesa location. I found the dress of my dreams!! It fits me perfectly thanks to their amazing alterations department. Neda was attentive, knowledgeable, and so polite during each of my fitting sessions. Khanh did a fabulous job altering the dress to fit me! I would highly recommend this David's Bridal location because of Neda and Khanh!</Review>

My experience at David's Bridal was great.  My stylist, Cailee, was awesome and great to work with.  I showed her what I wanted from their online store, even though they didn't have it, she came up with other dresses that were similar to what I was looking for.  I liked that she listen and understood me.  I would definitely recommend her.</text>

<Review>From start to finish my experience with finding my wedding dress was so easy and painless.  The associate helping me pick out my dress helped me find the perfect one that I didn’t even think about choosing for myself.  My dress arrived sooner than expected and the fitting went so smoothly.  My seamstress was so professional and made my dress so beautiful with the custom off the shoulders sleeves.  I definitely feel like a princess bride.  They have a dress to fit anyone’s budget.  I would highly recommend going here.<//Review>< pictures>

She knew how nervous I was, and instantly embraced me, my sister, and my mom with love.  She is very knowledgeable with her job and being able to read people.  She communicates very well and doesn’t push for a purchase.  She has a very warm and funny personality.  This made the process much more enjoyable and way less stressful.  My experience with Carla at David’s bridal was fun and memorable.  I am so grateful to have met Carla.  A million thanks for a gentle woman who clearly demonstrates her passions and values towards the brides (and the wedding party).

My Stylist Diana was amazing! Helpful in every way! I was one of “those” brides and was having second thoughts about my first wedding dress I picked out, as my wedding party that came with me was “rush, rush, rush.” Even then, Diana was calm, and still helped in every way. The second time around, she didn’t mind that I came back, and once again graciously listened to all my requests. I found the PERFECT dress within an hour! It’s amazing! I love Diana and David’s Bridal, and would suggest them to any bride to be!</Review>

My consultant ordered a dress that would arrive two days after the wedding date.  The dress needed altered as its four sizes too large.  It's almost impossible to get tailoring advice.  I paid an extra sixty dollars to have a rush order, this rush order was lost and David's Bridal said that maybe they took the sixty for tailoring in the future.  Makes no sense.  I wrote corporate, left a message for the CEO and no one called me back.
The good news is that it did arrive, it doesn't fit.  I showed the bridal consultant on that day and she said it's a perfect fit! I showed her that it was about six inches too big around hips, waist too big and way too small on top. Nope it's a perfect fit! Haha
I don't know why I'd laugh, I have eight weeks. David's Bridal manager told
me I won't find one anywhere in time.  NO one will be able to deliver in time.
Go somewhere else.<//review>

Carla was amazing and she made the experience fun, easy and sincere. Like most brides, I thought I knew what I wanted, but changed my mind when saw the other options at David's Bridal. Initially I was hesitant about making an appointment there because of all the cheesy commercials I used to see as a little girl. But my dress was affordable, within my budget, and still absolutley gorgeous!</review>

Emily and Kambria were such a huge help for finding my “one” dress for my big day!! They were thoughtful of what I wanted and were quick and honest. You won’t be disappointed getting your dress for any occasion at David’s bridal!<//Text>

My David's Bridal experience has been amazing so far! I've only picked out the dress and had my first alteration.
They made the experience so fun when I picked out my dress!  Very kind and helpful.
I just had my alterations done today and it went fabulously! They made my dress look and feel perfect!<//review>

Found my dream dress! They were able to make it even more beautiful with putting a corset back and through every step of alterations they were amazing. Lucy was the lady that helped me from start to finish and now I’m leaving with my dream dress and getting married exactly 1 month from today!</text>

< Review>
I was looking for a brand new Vera Wang dress at the Costa Mesa store. The assistant ( I forgot her name) sold me the wrong size and dirty dress. I went back to change it at another store at Long Beach store, the Costa Mesa store told me I could change it at their store because they actually had my size when I got the wrong size. unfortunately, my wedding was canceled, and when I wanted to return my dress within 15 days after I purchased it, the store refused my request because they said it passed my wedding date already. I did not even have a chance to wear it and I even cleaned the dirty dress they gave me. It was a horrible experience for me to shop there.<//Review>

From the time I walked it the store was overwhelming ... the dresses were all shoved together not in order by size or style... the girl that helped me only grabbed the three dresses I had looked up ahead of time none fit me they were way to big and didn’t come in any other size she didn’t use clips to give me a idea of what it could be... she have my friend two clips and let us do it our selves ... then I asked if they had one dress I saw on the wall she said it was only in size two and I could special order it... how can you sell a dress to a bride without them being able to try it on? I was completely disappointed in my experience and felt very sad.... the customer service when I entered the girl was sweet that checked me in but no attention or help me to find a dress I would want to say you to from my consultant ... I will stick to bridal boutiques that cater to the bride have newer selection and provide more one on one time with the bride to make the experience special</text>

This review is for my girls who helped me select and fit my dress! Diana was kind, patient and helpful! She always made me excited about my dress.
Hanieh helped fit my dress to look perfect on my type of body while being thoughtful and making great suggestions. She also showed us how to do the bustle very clearly which we filmed so our entire bridal party can reference how to.
Thank you to both my girls!!!<//Text>

My husband  and I visited David’s Bridal at South Coast Plaza to pick up my Golden Anniversary wedding dress from alterations. The dress is absolutely stunning. Similar to all prior visits, every staff member, including customers, treated us like royalty. This has been an unforgettable experience that we will  treasure forever. I cannot wait to return for another beautiful dress. Thank you!<//text>

Went in there to look for a try on a few dresses.  They were for a special event, not a wedding.  My daughter and I were told to look around, the dresses were arranged by color.  That's it.  We had to ask a staff member for a fitting room, and we were not asked if we were doing ok or needed assistance.  Which thank goodness we didn't.  We picked a style, figured out our size.  Left the store.  Called the Riverside store and placed our order with one of their sales associates.</Review>

Decided to go with David's Bridal for my wedding day. Picked a beautiful dress and was told that the tailoring is about 120$. Here I am at the appointment with the tailor. He seemed very professional,  after one hour and a half of measuring and details and a bill of 300$ , all I could think about was that the dress will come out just perfect.
And here I am again at David's Bridal to pick up my dress. Very dissapointed.The bustle was totally wrong, once it was settle you could see the material under, the sewing.
The lady who was helping me out could see that the bustle was wrong and called a different tailor to help.me out( the one who tailor it was not there)
After an hour of trying to figure it out , the tailor came up with something and schedule me for the next week.On top of that I was charged 14$ more, saying that I have only paid for 3 bustle, and I need 5.
I was totally unhappy with the top part around my neck, beautiful lace it was all gathered around my neck, and when I asked if it could be fixed she told me that is not possible. .After a week I picked up my dress, I barely saw the tailor, and when I mentioned to the ladies t that I m still not happy with how it looks around my neck and also felt it s a.little tight and could use to loosen up a little bit , they said that it s just perfect.Not to mention that the dress had the cups which were to small and they added cups my size without removing the other ones.
I felt rushed and for the  amount of money paid it should have been just perfect. I do not recommend the tailoring team from David' s Bridal.< /Text>

I'm getting married next month and needed to find a dress that was affordable, elegant, classy, and would actually fit! With the help of Colleen, I found my dress and the alterations required are very minimal. Thank you Colleen for helping me! She was very attentive to what I needed and was able to communicate to the seamstress what I couldn't. Colleen is amazing and I recommend you go see her!< /Text>

I am beyond happy with my experience at David's Bridal thanks to Melissa! I walked in very anxious and nervous to try on wedding dresses. Melissa helped me gather a few dress I liked and after a couple dresses she suggested a option based on a combination of the dresses I tried on and my descriptions. Words can't describe how in love I am with the dress she suggested most importantly because I said yes to the dress! She was very patient with me and did everything in her power to make this such a wonderful experience for me! It's like I'm in a fairytale! I'm so in shock I found my dress and I absolutely love it !  "The jitters"is what the dress caused in me. Thank you so much Melissa!< /Text>

We had a fantastic experience! My stylist, Heather was very helpful. I didn’t know much about what I wanted in a dress so we just tried on some that, from first glance, I liked. From there, Heather picked up little details of what I liked in each dress. She hand picked something for me and I loved it! I ended up ordering the dress she picked that same day.
On top of that,  I didn’t have any appointments for my bridesmaids or my mom, but they still eagerly assisted us despite the store being so busy. Overall, our experience with David’s Bridal in Costa Mesa was amazing!

Update: had my very first fitting today and I had an amazing experience with their alterations department! I feel bad bc I forgot their names but I believe the tailor that did the pins for me has been working there for 20 years. She was so quick and so very sweet. I can’t wait for the second fitting and seeing my dress in its final state.<//review>

Laura was outstanding. She took such great care our Prom dress needs. We had no appointment and she made us feel like we were the only people in the store. We got a dress and got rush alterations same day. What a great experience for our prom goer and for grandma. Do yourself a favor and come see Laura at Davids Bridal. She is fantastic, outstanding, brillant and very caring. Thank you!!!!!!!<//Review>

Had an alteration for a bridesmaid dress along with my mom. Hannah was amazing and soooo helpful. She helped my mom with pointers on how to help her look her very best. She was professional and welcoming. She made the whole experience. Thank you.</Text>

What a wonderful experience. This store has the best selection of bridal dresses.  Heather was our consultant and helped my sister pick out the most beautiful dress for her big day.  She was absolutely amazing.  She narrowed down what my sister wanted and was so fast getting her in and out of dresses, but took her time to find the right one.  Heather was great.  I would defiantly recommend her.<//review>

This was absolutely the WORST experience I had dress shopping anywhere. The stylist was rude, literally told my bridesmaids she did not care to know their names. When she asked for my wedding details, she didn't listen and said "oh chilly." That's it. I told her I already had a dress in mind and she STRAIGHT UP told me that there's no point in me being here because she is not gonna change my mind. After I told her multiple times I was open minded to other options. She put the one dress I tried on on the FLOOR in the dressing room. It was an overall terrible experience. This is a really special time for a bride and she made it not only a normal experience, but horrible.</Text>

Victoria was the sweetest most patient and detailed stylist we could have ever had the pleasure of working with! She was extemely patient given our personalities and opinions she also catered to our brides every needs and assisted her in bringing forth her vision. We could not have had a kinder most detail oriented person! Victoria- you were definitely invested and we could not thank you enough!<//Review>

I hate shopping for clothes period. But my personal stylist Melissa changed the whole game for me. She made everything easy for me. She did all the work while I sat back and relaxed. I felt so beautiful in the dresses she chose for me. She knew what I liked and what I didn't like and found dresses that fit my style. I had the best experience here and said yes to the dress on the same day! Not only was I able to find my dress, I got it altered as well. That itself was a huge weight off my shoulders. (I don't live in the area) I'm so happy I chose this place and I highly recommend it. This place went above and beyond my expectations and I would give it 10 stars if there was that option.<//Text>< Pics>

I found the dress! The appointment went very well. I did have to wait for the actual dress I wanted to try on but my consultant did a wonderful job filling in time and having me try on different options. I would suggest more chairs for family and friends and maybe even more fitting rooms. Melissa was my consultant! Such a sweet person!< /text>

I was hesitant about coming to this David’s Bridal particularly because it was in Orange County, but the staff was surprisingly sweet and very helpful! Miss Carla is the absolute best and knows what she’s doing when it comes to dresses. Even though I didn’t have much of a say in the style of bridesmaid dress, Miss Carla assured me throughout the whole process and put my anxieties at ease. They also gave me free shipping out of the kindness of their hearts and that was completely unexpected, but much appreciated. Thanks!</text>

<Review>Had an exceptional wonderful experience at David’s bridal at South Coast Metro. Jessica and Elizabeth were very helpful and I can’t thank them enough. Jessica went above and beyond to help me with my dress that did not fit and I still had the tags on it and it was in excellent shape. Got the exact same dress and I’m so very happy and all the stress is now gone as my wedding is in about 10 days.

I’m going to do a yelp review as well.
Sincerely,
Stacey<//Review>< Pics>

I visited this David’s several months ago, and I fell so in love with my experience! My consultant Shannon was absolutely wonderful and incredibly receptive. The second dress she put me in was my dream dress!! I’m just now writing this review because I wasn’t engaged at the time and I wanted to keep the dress hush-hush, and I’m so happy I finally get to tell everyone how amazing the appointment was!!

Also, when I ordered my dress, I was told it would take about 6 weeks for productions bad shipping, but my gown was ready for pickup 6 DAYS after I ordered! I would not count on this being the case every time, but it may be something to keep in mind if you need to hide your dress (like I did). Needless to say, the dress turned out amazing. I hope this helps some other brides-to-be!<//Review>

I made an appointment to pick out 10 Bridesmaids dresses. The girl at the front was very polite and greeted me right away. The "manager" that was assigned to help me, took out color swatches and told me to pick a color and then immediately took a phone call for 9 minutes, asked the person on the phone if she could put her on hold for "like 2 minutes" while she helped me...the customer in the store. I asked her if I could see some of the new Satin dresses that I saw online and she said they were on back order until March, which is fine I just wanted to see the satin material in person. We walked over to the sample dresses and she walked in the other direction and talked with another employee for 7-9 minutes then came back and asked if I wanted to purchase any color swatches.

I expected my appointment (which would have resulted in 10 dresses being purchased) to actually be an appointment. I wanted to try the dresses on and get all the colors picked and ordered, but she was clearly not interested in helping me at all.

Needless to say my girls will NOT be getting their bridesmaids dress from David's Bridal nor would I recommend going to this location. I am extremely disappointed and really bummed out that my experience was this awful.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I have had a wonderful experience with David’s Bridal Costa Mesa! Finding the right dress to walk down the aisle was so easy with all the help of the amazing staff. I ended up loving the first dress I tried on, but that didn’t stop her from allowing me to try on 6 more dresses only to go right back into the first one before saying Yes to the Dress!!! And now my fitting with Patricia went perfectly. She was professional and kind, she even had me laughing while standing still for an hour. She helped me get the dress to the perfect length and made it even more perfect for me! My custom fit wedding dress! Now we will wait to see how it all turns out. But I’m sure it will be another pleasant experience and I will leave another happy customer!</Review>< Pics>

My experience from start to finish was wonderful. I walked in hopeful but also apprehensive as trying on a lot of dresses is not really my cup of tea.  Madison was so helpful and really made the entire experience.  She expertly balanced helping me find the perfect dress for me while politely handling my mom and aunts opinions  She helped me find my dress...and it is perfect!<//text>

<review>I went into David’s bridal at south coast plaza with 4 of my 7 bridesmaids. From the minute I walked in they were very welcoming and nice! The stylist who helped us for our appointment was Diana. She was very very helpful! I can’t thank her enough. With 4 girls, we had her running around pulling different dresses and did it with a genuine smile and sv great opinions and suggestions. All 4 of my girls ended up getting their dresses and absolutely loved them. Couldn’t have been more satisfied with their service (especially Diana)!</review>< rate>

<rating>2<//rating><review>pointed out few dresses to try on, the stylist consultant only gotten 4/6 dresses, without providing corset/ slip. She did bring out a pair of heels. Then I asked if there are any dress that’s like a combo, as in I can take the skirt/piece off and looks like another dress. The consultant said yes, proceed to ask me if short dresses were ok, because combo ones only available in short dresses. Then she went and got a completely different dress (Long dress with loose threads and broken belt. I was told it was a clearance dress. Sold as is). Also, I should have been getting size 2. But she insisted on size 6 instead. So we came to the middle of size 4. All the dresses end up little bit loose- like expected. She did not clip me in, until my friend requested her to do so. And she did it for ONE DRESS ONLY, with 2 clips. She should have used more clips on that single dress, because it was still loose. She was suppose to be a bridal dress stylist consultant, 0 consulting was received. My friends and I could have done the same she did. Probably won’t return to Costa Mesa’s David bridal. If I go back, will try another location instead. Gave them two stars for friendliness.

<Review>There are not words to express what a pleasure it was from the moment I walked into the shop in Costa Mesa...Diana Hernandez defenitly leads by example. I did not have an appointment, I knew exactly what I wanted  (I had visted a different location that I was not going to purchase from due to my shoppoing experience). Diana was more than helpful, she had options that I had not been offered before and was going to make sure I got exactly what was going to make me happy. She covered the front of store just so that she could offer the experience she knew I deserved as a bride to be, she made everything better...I am a former retail manager, and Diana has all the key components I would look for when recruiting, my guess is she drives results!! I am happy to share my experience with everyone I know in need of gown for all upcoming events. Thank you Diane for changing my mind, I can not wait to wear my beautiful wedding dress!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Place was huge, the staff was super helpful, especially my stylist, Carla. She made it a fun experience, and I found the dress!

Edit: Came here twice more. Again, Carla is so fun and still helping brides out. The staff is very attentive for the most part!
Just these past two times I came- 1 for finding a dress with a bridesmaid and 1 for alterations, I didn't feel as tended to, and I felt like the price of alterations was insane-
The other time, with my bridesmaid, the stylist who helped was a man. Now, I'm all for men and women doing jobs wherever they'd like, but it was hard for a man to understand some concerns a woman may have about fitting- unless they've been in the clothing industry for a while! They were as helpful as they could be by providing the dresses in the right color- but obviously I had to help my bridesmaid get in dresses (which I'm bad at lol) and then it was only when a female assistant came and heard my bridesmaids fit concerns that a great dress was found!< /text>

I had a great experience with David bridal! First I came in to just look at dresses and get an idea of what I wanted and then brought my mom in later to see some. They kept everything hush hush about me being there earlier lol. Carla helped me and she was wonderful! And I came today to pick up my dress after only about 2 weeks of waiting! Emily helped me out and she was amazing!< /Text>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>I’ve had a few experiences here. Some of the girls working here are genuinely kindhearted and helpful. I’m most upset recently because after talking with multiple employees I was told to order a size up on my bridesmaids dress and then I’d probably only need the upper portion of the dress, the body, taken in. Which they estimated is usually around $40. I was like cool. Then when I went in to my alteration appt, the alterations totaled to $145!!!! This costs more than the price of my dress!!! They offered to discount and remove some things but it was still over $100! I was astonished, totally misled into the purchase of the size in my dress. I think this store overbooks appointments and there are just a lot of instances like mine that slip through the cracks and make this store frustrating. Whether you are a bride or not a bride you are a customer of the store and should be treated well. Instead I’ve experienced bad customer service, employees talking bad about me behind my back, being walked in on half-naked in the dressing room, and being totally misled about my dress purchase. I will not return. To top it off, I took my dress to a different amazing alterations shop near my house...same alterations with a nice satin ribbon for the body cost me $55 and will take half the time!!! Glad I passed on David’s bridal alterations.</Review>< pics>

Back again and look to be sure. I ended up deciding to keep the original dress I picked and I was so grateful they were willing to help me feel 100% about my decision. We  only had two little mistakes we encountered. One was a dress we ordered was sent to the wrong address and another dress never got ordered but they handled everything well besides that and I am still very pleased with how they have such great customer service!!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I had a great experience with Carla and Emily.  My experience was better than my expectations could have imagined.  This was my first time trying on dresses, and I mainly went in just to browse and kind of see what the experience would be, I had planned on making an appointment in the next couple months.  I ended up trying on dresses, and it turned out that the first dress was the one!!!< /review>

<text>We had to wait for our stylist who was then MIA throughout most of the appointment (not sure if she was helping more than one person?). I get that we were trying on floor samples (bridesmaid dresses), but one was yellowing around the edges (blue dress!) and a couple others had holes. There was a broken speaker next to us, so listening to static music was tedious. Underwhelmed by both the dresses and overall experience.< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1568898659741, 'text': 'Hello Alanna, we are very sorry to hear that your trip to David’s Bridal was less than satisfactory.

<rate>5<//rate><Review>We came to David’s after a pretty disappointing visit to a “fancy” boutique dress shop. There, we were treated poorly once I mentioned wanting to keep within my budget. So when my group went to David’s in MetroPointe for my final appointment, I was pretty dejected and not expecting much.
But wow! We walked in and were just so happily surprised with the dress selection. So many beautiful options, even with my “limited budget” , and Chenee’ T was just amazing. She listened and fine tuned our choices and,even with so many opinions, she remained unflappable. (I had sisters, my mom, a cousin, an aunt all VERY vocal with their thoughts 🤦🏼‍♀️) She not only found me lots of beautiful dress options, she found THE dress!! My entire group was literally in happy tears by the end. She was so personal and caring and genuinely interested in finding me the best dress suited for me. I am so over the moon happy with my dress and the service she provided us! Thank you David’s Bridal and especially THANK YOU, Chenee’ T!!!!<//Review>< pics>

Words don't even begin to express my gratitude to Carla Stallworth at your Metro Point location! I came in with anxiety and not at all like my normal self. Carla recognized it immediately and began to slowly peel all those awkward uncomfortable feelings away! You truly made my experience today beyond perfect!! Thank you for your guidance and suggestions, and for making me feel zero pressure! You're a beautiful soul Carla! Thank you a million times over! I'll definitely be back!<//review>

Great experience! My stylist, Shannon, was lovely. She was super helpful, patient, personable, and knowledgeable. I appreciated the alterations team coming out to make sure my special requests can be accommodated, too. Overall, everyone there was smily and sincere. Even though there are a ton of brides going through there at any given time, the team made me feel like I was truly special. I said YES to my dress and I couldn’t be more excited for my wedding!< /Text>

Such a great experience! I did not think I would find my dress at David’s Bridal but still wanted to give it a chance. I booked an appointment at 10:30 but came early 9:30. They were quick to find me a stylist who became my new best friend. Maggie was the chillest! I came alone to not allow anyone’s opinion to guide my decision. Maggie matched my vibe & gave me space to appreciate the dress. When I decided it was the one she let me ring the bell. She was never made me feel like she was pushing a sale. Highly highly recommend her!<//Text>

They were nice, but not as on top of the clipping the dress together as other places.   She also didn't actually select any styles for me, which I actually didn't mind, but some might like that "stylist" type that suggests things for you.  I did find a dress that was my second favorite of all I found and it was super hard to decide, but I ended up going with a different vendor.</Review>

Khanh - Seamstress
Neda - Fitting

Both ladies were amazing! I loved how my wedding dress turned out. Khanh and Neda were both very friendly and made sure that my wedding dress looked perfect on me before I walked out. Neda was super helpful in doing my fitting the first. She was very patient with me as I expressed how I wanted the dress to look on me at the end. I would highly recommend Khanh and Neda for alterations to my friends. They both work at the Davids Bridal in Costa Mesa, CA.</Text>

She hugged us and spent more than the allotted time with us until I found my dress. We even went back the same day to make a purchase. She did not pressure us to buy but wanted to be realistic with availability. She is so sweet we fell in love with her along with the dress. I would go back in now to hug her.

There was only one bride being helped in the entire store. Several sales girls appeared not to be doing anything would not help my daughter with wedding gowns.  We did not have an appointment, so they simply turned us away.  I've been to a David's Bridal near my hometown and they have always been willing to help me with or without an appointment.</text>

We went there on a Saturday Morning. It was super crowded, not a lot of room to actually take pictures and see if we like the dresses. The stylist receiving us was overwhelmed as it seemed like she was working with someone else and not only us. She told us that chairs would be coming our way and after  like 15 mins of standing the Bride's mom had to sit down in someone's else chair as no one ever came to us with chairs. For the 90 mins, we all stood up with little to no service and we felt rushed and the stylist  wasn't giving us the best choices for our bride to choose from. The Bride felt super rushed and we didn't feel like our business was needed that day. Our 90 mins which left like was 30 mins since our stylist kept disappearing on us. We would watch other stylist stay with their Brides and help them with the dresses etc... but our experience with our stylist was totally different, didn't help the bride pick or look at any other dresses besides the ones you find in the reception area and didn't really know what the bride was asking for in what SHE wanted as a dress.  I think we will looking around somewhere with better service. I will be avoiding this place in the future.</text>

<Review>If I can give Diana 10 Stars I absolutely would do so.  This was my second visit to Davids Bridal.  The first visit was to the one in Brea, that visit sucked to say the least.  My sister suggested I try this one so I made an appointment for Metro Point.  Before going to this appointment I went online and read the reviews for this location.  There were many reviews talking about how helpful Diana was and I honestly thought people were exaggerating, but I quickly learned when I got to my appointment that nope they were not exaggerating.  Diana was on point with her expertise, friendliness and professionalism.  Her ability to quickly learn my style and what complimented my body was amazing.  It was a completely different experience, I truly enjoyed it.  I found my dress and I love it!  I would absolutely recommend Diana to everyone.  You will not be disappointed. 🙂< /Review>< gmapID>

Bella helped me find the perfect dress for my daughter's wedding in mid-May. She was friendly, very knowledgeable and always professional.

Three days later, I met with Nhu and Khanh in Alterations. Together, they helped me feel like I was the only person in the room.  Additionally, prior to my fitting, and at my request, they made a suggestion as to the best shoes to wear for the wedding event. Next, Khanh hemmed my dress flawlessly as Nhu used her professional eye to make my dress as beautiful as possible.

David's Bridal is blessed to have the very best working with them:  Bella, Khanh, Nhu are the very best.  Thank you, Ladies, for helping me feel so amazing.< /Text>

< review>
Took my sister to her first dress fitting. She came in a little timid, not knowing what style would fit her best or what fabrics she liked. The ladies at the store were sweet and helpful. They were positive and were able to help my sister decide what she did and didn't like. We didn't buy a dress this visit but we did walk away knowing what size, fabric, cut, and shape the bride wants.  It was an extremely helpful and fun experience!</review>

Everyone was totally helpful and wonderful!

Carla was not only helpful, patient, and caring, but she was also honest, loving and respectful of cost. She’s one of the best sales ladies we have ever encountered for any shopping. Carla, we love you.

Yours,
Olga Krug and Hilda Sugarman</review>

I went in on a Sunday morning to try on dresses. Cristy was my consultant and I’m so glad she was! I showed her some ideas so she got a feel for what I liked but told her I was fairly open to try other styles. She had showed me a picture of a dress before my appointment she thought I’d like and we kinda forgot about it until we were 4 dresses in. Then she brought it out and my gosh I lost it. She encouraged me to still try on the other two we had picked out just to be sure. And I’m so glad she did. That way I was certain it was my dress! She was so patient and very knowledgeable. She made me feel so comfortable the entire time and constantly was checking in on how I was feeling. After every dress we would reassess and compare. And I love that ! She was able to understand my dos and donts ! Thank you for picking out my dream dress Cristy !</review>

Yadira was SOOOOO wonderful!!! She was so patient and so kind and encouraging to my mom (who is plus size) while she tried on dresses for her 2nd wedding - she was never judgmental or worries - just kind and allowed us space to make our choice! And we loooive the dress!! It was on clearance and we got a steal of a price for a  GORGEOUS dress!! Yadira never pushed more expensive  dresses on but just wanted us to really get what she wanted. I was sooo thrilled!!  I've had mediocre experiences with David's Bridal before but Yadira  made all the difference!!

Neda did a phenomenal job for my mom as her alterations person! Not only was she very precise about every part of the dress, she also shared in conversation with my mom and me and was completely patient with my two girls! She has an amazing story and is a very special person! She made my mom feel at ease and comfortable and did everything she could to ensure a perfect fitting for my mom! She also hemmed my bridesmaid dress and was very efficient with her work and made everything look beautiful! She is honest, does excellent work and is just a fascinating person!! Thank you for making us feel wonderful and doing such an excellent job!!</Text>

We are happy with dress, Carla was very friendly and helpful. But overall we didn’t satisfied and my fiancé and me got mad about authorization pricing. In front they gave us a price estimate but when we received our order and we did authorization appointment and we got 4 times more than the estimation. Not happy, be careful for the pricing.</review>

I'm having a civil wedding so i was looking for a simple gown on a limited budget. I was paired up with Diana who by the way is bilingual which was nice because my mother and i were able to communicate with her perfectly.

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>Disappointing. My sales girl was great. But, bathroom was not acceptable. Lighting is terrible (and depressing). No mirror in fitting room and no bench or chair to set personal items (handbag, clothes, etc.) on. I felt like I was in the Walmart of bridal salons. (Was I?) The girl helping me, Kaley?, was delightful. There were not any water bottles or even cups so she gave me one she had frozen in the freezer. She gets an A+ for everything she has to put up with working here. She adds at least a star or two to the rating.< /text><Rating>3</Rating></record>

So far, I feel very at ease with using DB for the purchase and alterations, the location was easy to find, the store is clean, and the staff was wonderful! They have so many options and ideas, alterations prices are what I expected, and I feel good about them handling my dress.

Incredible customer service, HUGE dress selection, and prices for every budget!

Positives...
---Customer service
---Knowledge of employees
---Dress selection
---Prices
---Sample dresses were reasonably clean and in great condition
---Use of shapewear if needed

Negatives...
---Store is under construction and the customer experience is seriously lacking :(  A more private area for each bride, champagne and a more intimate "boutique-y" feel would have been really nice....maybe that's coming with the remodel?

Carla (<---beyond amazing), Joy, Jessica & Meshelle were all so incredibly helpful and knowledgable!  I had so much fun and found the dress of my dreams!  Thank you SO MUCH, to each of you!!  Better experience than I could have hoped for!</Review>

< Review>
Stephanie and her manager was great at the David’s Bridal in Costa Mesa!! Stephanie helped me pick out a brides maid dress and she was so encouraging throughout the whole process!! She even helped me cancel a order Of a dress I had Already purchased at the Murrieta David’s bridal shop!! Unfortunately, the manager at the Murrieta David’s Bridal would not cancel the order herself over the phone even though I was talking to her directly about the cancellation! She even made me hold on the phone until a computer was available - about 10 minutes- before asking to talk to the manager at the Costa Mesa store! At which time the Murrieta manager asked the Costa Mesa manager to take care of it!! It was extremely unprofessional on the part of the Murrieta Manager!  But it was taken care of without issue by the Costa Mesa Manager! I will continue to go to the Costa Mesa store from now on even though it takes an hour and half to get there!!< /Review>

< Review>
Extremely disappointed in their customer service over the phone nonetheless the girl who picked up the phone was a unfriendly and seemed like I was bothering her day. We had a bridesmaids emergency after a dress was lost and the wedding being in 9 days. after sharing my story she acted like she could give two sh***. I asked her to look it up and see if they had the dress or could order it. Her response was we just don't carry that. i asked her to please look up the shipping time. she put me on a long hold and came back and said it would not. I asked her to call the shipping department to see if they could ship it quicker she said she would talk to her manager and would have to call me back. After spoon feeding her how to do her job i called my local store where i originally bought the dresses. Mary was super sympathetic and eager to find a solution. she check every store in California for me and found that that if i ordered tonight the dress would make it in time. Its a shame that the credit for this dress goes to this store when in reality it belong to the Florida Melbourne store. Costa Mesa store really showed work on empathy and going the extra mile for there costumers.< /Review>

They only had 1 of the dresses out of 10 I liked on their website. If the dress on the website is on sale, then you can only buy it without any refunds. When I told the associate I preferred a white or off-white tone and satin material she said both were not in in style so not carried at the store. She told me no one likes those styles. This made me feel like she was not supportive of my personal style and choices. She also called me "broad" and kept pushing a larger size of a dress on me. I was completely dissatisfied with the service at David's bridal.<//text>

So i went in with no appointment cause i didnt realize you needed one for bridesmaid shopping. Thankfully they booked me in 30 min from when i arrived.  Emily ended up helping  me and was awesome. Her and the other consultants seems super overbooked but she was super patient and grabbed so many dresses for me. I ended up finding a great one but realized i might not make it in time but i still really appreciated the help.< /Text>

<response>None</response><Review>Kanh Kanh Kanh!!! Is phenomenal. My wedding was in September ‘19 and having just been diagnosed w MS, I was very unwell. I will say the manager was less than helpful having twice over talked me around in circles but Kanh not only saved the day, she is an expert seamstress. She was kind, compassionate and my dress turned out BEAUTIFULLY. My dress was very simple so the lines were so important! I was on such strong IV steroids by the time my last fitting came around that the final adjustments were tricky because I was SO PUFFY! She was able to see that one of my shoulder sits slightly lower than the other and one breast is slightly smaller and so she devised this genius adjustment using two different cup inserts. I am forever thankful for Kanh and while I think DB should train their managers to actively listen, to review dates and pricing (by the end I was so nickel and dimed upcharged rush fees when they themselves were the ones who gave me the alteration dates full well knowing the date of my event 🤷‍♀️), Kanh saved this customer experience from disaster. With that said, thank goodness that’s only happening once! David’s Bridal... what an asset you have in Kanh! If you know what’s good you’ll never let her get away!! Thank you for everything Kanh 💗< /Review>< Name>

Brenton is a genius with dress alterations.  I found a dress I loved expect for how low the dress was cut in the front.  I didn’t like any of the solutions others had come up with and didn’t want to pick a different dress. Brenton was great with coming up with alternative ideas and made sure that I looked amazing and loved my dress.  He truly is great at what he does!</review>

<review>Diana was amazing yesterday. She asked to see what dresses I had in mind and she could already tell what my budget was from seeing the prices of the ones I showed her. She didn't bring me a single dress that was over that limit, which I really appreciated. I had a particular silhouette in mind, but I told her I wanted to see one of each just to be sure. She brought me several different silhouettes in several different fabrics so we could narrow it down to exactly the type of dress I wanted. I tried on 7 dresses total, but I knew from dress #2 that it was the one. She was kind and very encouraging! 5 stars for Diana, and the whole experience!

There were so many Choises and the sales person was amazing. She made me feel comfortable and listened to exactly what I wanted and made it happen. I was very impressed, definitely going to recommend the Cost Mesa David’s Bridal to everyone I know. Thank you for helping me make memories.<//Review>

<review>They were wonderful. I have been in contact with three David’s bridal locations at Long Beach towns center, Torrance and Costa Mesa. Fabiola at Long Beach town center was amazing. Janelle at Torrance was absolutely the sweetest and magali at Costa Mesa was wonderful she found me the one!  Such great things with all of them. Go see them you won’t be disappointed!<//review><gmap_id>0x80dcdf39820ccf1d:0x418e1dde81487a7d<//gmap_id>< user_id>

I had Nicci as my Bridal stylist and she was amazing! She knew exactly what would look good on my body even when I wasn’t sure I would like it. She picked the most beautiful dresses and I found the one during our appointment! Thank you !!<//review>

Karla by far made my sisters bridal gown try one a day to remember! We only went to see what kind of dresses to try on to by somewhere else and ended up purchasing the dress there. She was a great person and is really good at her job. She made our experience amazing and we left happy customers<//review>

The wedding dress adviser was very nice. But unfortunately, I received an email from them. It said ”Cancelled appointment ”. That's why I didn't go there but I received the adviser’s message. She didn't know my appointment was canceled. I have no idea what can I deal with this situation.<//Text>

Unfortunately this was not a great experience from start to finish. Firstly, we were kept waiting for about 20 mins before the lady came to greet us. She asked a bit about what I wanted, I told her I really didn’t know and was looking for some guidance but had picked out a few dresses to try and see what they looked like. There was not a large selection at this store at all. The lady took me over to a room which she thought was ours, but walked in on another bride changing! We were then taken to a back corner of the fitting rooms, into a tiny room. She brought out the dresses I’d chosen for me to try on. She literally offered no help or advice in the way of styling or what might look good on my body. The dresses were dirty, and a few smelled like body odor. They were also so uncomfortable I was dying to get out of it after a few minutes. I also wasn’t given a pedestal to stand on to see how the dresses looked when elevated. She also never brought out any other dresses that she would recommend for me. The overall knowledge of the dresses and stock was totally lacking, even when we asked if the dresses came in a different color she said she’d have to check because she didn’t know. I feel like as a stylist at a bridal store, you should know little things like that.

The whole thing felt very rushed and I was hoping for some more guidance and advice in buying a wedding dress, but I didn’t get it from David’s Bridal. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere, you can find much better quality and service for a just a little more money, which in my opinion is well worth it to have a good experience.</text>

<Review>Was pretty disappointed they didn’t have the dresses already pulled for us to try on. Didn’t have the color or sizes we needed for the girls to try on.

The workers were helpful and pulled what they could but I couldn’t make a decision due to the girls not being in the correct color or size.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

My name is Lisa, i just went in to try on dresses this weekend at David's Bridal in Costa Mesa, and everything was amazing.  I had the pleasure of dealing with Casey, she was wonderful.  Her service was top notch, she had a great bubbly personality, and just made me and my family feel comfortable and like we had known her for ever.  She helped me find my perfect wedding dress, and I would high recommend her for any girl who is looking for that right dress.  She takes the time to listen to what your interests are and looks at pictures that you like, and then goes and pulls all these dresses that match your style.  My experience would not have been the same without her!</Review>

Yesterday June 15, 2019 at 9:00am came in to my appointment for my wedding dress. I was told to look around and take pictures of the dress i was interested in so my stylist can bring them to my dressing room.

My stylist was busy with 3 braids and had no time for me also, the fitting room was small and tight, had no room at all. I got my sister to bring me all my dresses and my friend assisting me.

After, my grandmother was sitting on one of the chairs and one stylist rudely said to her "can you move, I have a very important client that needs all these seats because they need to sit and you need to move."

First of all, I had an appointment and no one helped me. Secondly, I never complained about having a small room. Lastly, the rude stylist's "important braid friend" was picking a fight with my sister and saying horrible things and to add on that racist things. Finally I asked for the manager and let her know what was happening and left with my party.

The manager called me to offer me 10% off the dress and apologize for what happen but also added that to come one the weekdays because it was better not weekends. First of all they should work with schedule not the other way around. BTW the dresses were in bad condition and smelled bad. After all this bad experience I made an appointment with Nordstrom (the one at the Brea Mall).< /review>

I had the best experience picking out dresses with Madisyn. She was so knowledgeable and honest about what dresses she liked best on me when I asked her. She also didn’t pick out dresses over my budget or try to sell me on more than what I asked for and never rushed me. I will definitely be shopping again at this David’s bridal in the future!< /text>

<text>To have at least a 4 Star experience at DB (at least in Feb.):
1. DO NOT GO ON WEEKENDS!!!!! If you have to, go Friday evenings an hour or two before closing.
2. ASK IF DANA IS AVAILABLE. She was so wonderful and really knew her stuff!!
3. Keep tabs on your dress style on DB website. Mine dropped $200 after I bought it. They still did a price adjustment for me, even though today is day 15 after purchase!

After an absolutely horrible 1st experience with DB, I thought I'd never go back. Girl didn't know what she was doing... HOWEVER!! I decided to go back and try again, mostly planning on looking at styles and finding my dress elsewhere. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DANA!!!! She had me walk through the dresses with her to look at styles. She really listened to what I wanted and found some beautiful dresses!! In the end, I ended up getting a dress my mom picked out, but the service was 100x better than before!</text><resp>None<//resp><Name>Megan Rogers<//Name>< Gmap_id>

I went in on a Saturday 1st appointment that was available. It was busy but I had a great time. Madisyn helped me figure out which shape I preferred. She was very friendly and helpful. She found 3 dresses that were all beautiful. Now I just have to make the hard decision of which one to get!</Review>

<username>Julie Cuttrell< /username><date>1544168555843</date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Selected my MOB dress a few months ago, and received very helpful service while finding the perfect gown. I scheduled my later alterations before I left the store with the garment. They sent me a reminder and were ready for me when I arrived for my fitting, and another reminder the day before I was scheduled to pick up the dress. Today I went in, tried on the perfectly altered dress,  and then I decided I needed a shaper and some accessories. The alterations staff went out of their way to help me find exactly what I needed. Honestly, the staff at the Costa Mesa David's Bridal could not have made this process any easier and they could not have been more helpful or accommodating. Thank you,  DB!</Review>< pictures>

<username>Catrina Rife<//username><pictures>None</pictures><Text>Claire helped me find a dress and the first one I tried on ended up being perfect. The only issue I had is that when my dress came in from shipping whoever made it was off. The breast cup was up to the collarbone and it was unwearable. Even the alterations woman said she couldn’t fix it. Unfortunately these things happen and it was nobody in the stores fault. It just so happened that the store just received my dress in the same size the day before. They were able to trade out the dresses and the woman who did my alterations was flawless.

Would definitely recommend anyone here.<//Text>< rating>

A little disappointing considering the reason you go into the store is to see what it’ll look like on you. But glad there was at least one so I know their 0 fits me nicely. I also saw someone else given a little gift bag when they checked in. I never got one /:<//Text>< pictures>

Yadira helped me twice and I had said yes to a dress the second time but i didn’t commit.  Thank goodness I didn’t, because I went with my first choice the third time. I said yes to my dress today (3rd time is the charm) and I went alone this time. Yadira wasn’t here today so I had Stephanie help me. I’ll post pictures after the wedding.<//Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Text>I went here to shop for a bridesmaid's dress. The staff was very helpful in bringing us dresses to try on. They have a good variety of styles and colors. The reason I rated them lower is that they have a very poor return and cancellation policy. Their policy is, no returns or cancellations. I consider that to be bad customer service, and pretty unnecessary. Even though the dresses are custom ordered, I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to resell them.< /Text>< Pictures>

<user_id>103910839608668339716</user_id><Text>This was my 4th wedding dress appointment and 2nd one at David's bridal. But this was a wholly different and amazing experience! Carla was the most amazing consultant I've met, in any industry. She listened to what I said and accommodated me but also read between the lines and made adjustments and recommendations based on what I didn't even know to say. I don't think I would ever actually bought a dress.. or I would have ended up with a "back up."
She gave enough pressure to get me to say what I liked and didn't, but i felt no pressure to buy, only to decide yes or no. Highly recommend Carla any day of the week....and David's prices are SUPER reasonable. 50%off !? Yes please!</Text><rate>5< /rate>< Gmap_id>

Okay so I had Diana as my stylist in the Costa Mesa location, and she was absolutely perfect! She listened to what i wanted, and made sure my opinion wasn't too influenced by the number of people o brought with me. Ultimately she was the one who picked out my winning dress! I went home to sleep on it before deciding to purchase and they were all so supportive and respectful. I never felt pressured to buy anything! When i came back the next day to get my dress the manager Jessica took care of us personally and she was phenomenal!! So professional and relatable. The staff made the experience so much fun! The ONLY reason I didn't give this a 5 star review is that the prices for the little "extras" like undergarments, dress bag etc. really added up quick and I wasn't prepared for the total. And that the alterations are an entirely separate fee that could cost almost as much as my dress! As much as I live the service I had at David's, as a bride on a budget I may shop around for alterations prices, or just get taller heels haha!< /Text>

If you don’t need any help in finding a dress then this place is the right place for you. We received no help from any of the ladies there. They showed us were the bridesmaid dresses were and that was it. We spent two hours there and thought we found a dress. The said there was a 20% off deal going on but when we told them which dress we wanted the said “except that one because that one is technically not a bridesmaid dress”. Which is weird since it was in the area of all the other bridesmaid dresses and no one told us. To top it off when we went to pay for it they asked for the color and they said “oh it doesn’t come in that color”. Terrible customer service and super unorganized. Good luck 👍🏼</review>

We went in to look at colors and Nicci was absolutely incredible. She pulled dress after dress in size after size  and made recommendations for cohesiveness. She was knowledgeable and checked on how long certain styles were in (so we would be able to guess if they'd be discontinued by the time we wanted to buy, how long they'd take to order etc). She knew we were potentially not purchasing today and treated us like a valued costumer. I will be requesting her when we come to purchase bridesmaid dresses and when I look for my dress. Thank you SO much, Nicci!

UPDATE: We came back for mother of the bride and more bridesmaid and Tammy was wonderful. Everytime I come here we get treated like important customers, not just people spending money. We pulled SO many dresses and she made several recommendations based on their body type, gave honest feedback and everyone left happy. Thank you Tammy for all your help.< /Review>

To start off with our consultant was not ready for us. We started search for dress on our own.  The consultant was helping other appointment at the same time we had our appointment.  The bride and the rest of the bridal party had to help each other to try on the dresses. We had to asked the consultant for the dress we wanted and she was not informed. I don't know about there rest of the consultant but Victoria L was doing a bad job. As we left the store after buy our bridesmaids dress...we were not address...with a good bye or thank you for shopping with us...no one word as we walked out.</Review>

The manager Anna at the Costa Mesa location is amazing!!! I am 5 months pregnant and had ordered a maternity wedding dress A pea in a pod but when I got it was baige color and not white at all as the website specified. My wedding is in 3 weeks...so I panicked and went to David’s Bridal. I have not had good experiences at David’s Bridal in the past but at this point I was desperate. Anna took the time to find the right dress that would fit my baby bump and she had an amazing customer service! She was able to order my dress and it will get here in time for my wedding! I was so happy and felt so beautiful in the dress we found together. Thank you so much Anna at the Costa Mesa David’s Bridal!< /review>

Went in because I needed to see if I could rush order a bridesmaids dress. The manager was extremely rude and telling me "no way, these are your only options." She only gave me 7 that were nothing like what the bride wanted and was trying to get me to order the dress then and there without consulting with the bride first. Ended up talking with the bride and realized there was a MUCH larger selection online. So while I was still not able to get the original dress, I was able to get one that's very similar. I should have never even gone to this store. I had a much better experience when I helped myself. I will say the the rest of the staff was very polite and tried to help but the manager just seemed to be in the mood to yell since not only was she yelling at me, she was also yelling at her staff.< /text>

I REALLY hope this is the right location I'm rating. I'm came here months ago, so I'm a little late on the rating, but it was amazing. I ended up at this David's Bridal after a day of heartbreak and disappointment at another bridal dress store in LA. We were able to get a same day appointment, we got there 30 mins early and right away they were very attentive, helpful, and had a sense of humor. The girl helping me was Danielle and she was nothing short of amazing!! She knew I was having a bad day and she actually listened to what I wanted and was looking for in a dress. She was very personable and kept reassuring me that i wouldn't walk out of that store without finding my dress, and she was right. After spending 2 1/2 hours working with me, trying on numerous dresses, and even staying after store hours, we found the perfect dress! I remember seeing the dress as soon as we walked in, but because of the price I didnt want to try it on and get my hopes up. Without telling me, my maid of honor gave it to Danielle to have me try on and everyone loved it. It was the very last dress I tried on and after talking about my price range, Danielle realized is was mislabeled and the actual price was in my price range!!

Sorry for such the long review, but I could go on and on about how great Danielle was, she was amazing!! She was also extremely patient with me even after trying on 7 dresses and not liking them!!<//review>

Today I had an appointment to look at bridesmaid dresses with my ladies! I got there a little bit early and was helped right away. Even though it was incredibly busy. Christy was our bridal consultant and she was absolutely fantastic. I gave her a couple colors and some ideas of what I had in mind and she went with it. And boy did she produce. She had many good ideas and my ladies ended up all walking out having found perfect dresses. I wanted the mix and match kind of look with Ron's of texture and a floral dress. Ans she found me all these amazing styles and dresses. I'm so incredibly happy and would suggest anyone to go to David's Bridal - Costa Mesa and ask for Christy!<//Text>

My sister is the bride and has had a horrible experience with this store. The employees are careless , rude and unprofessional. When they called her to come pick up her dress she finds out that the lace has been ripped off and is not repairable. They did nothing to accommodate her for the rip in her wedding dress and were extremely passive about the whole situation. I would never recommend anyone to this location.<//text>

When we decided to order, the associate told us all orders were shipped directly to the location we were at. Since my bridesmaids were from out of town, that option would not work for us. She told us we would have to go online to order them. As we were walking out, she came back and said her manager approved to allow shipping to the girls homes. Unfortunately, we already had a sour taste in our mouths by that point.<//review>< pictures>

I took my 11 year old daughter in for a dress for her 6th grade promotion! We have been several places and tried on at least 100 dresses before coming to Davids Bridal and I wasn’t sure what to expect! The wonderful consultant Carla was fantastic! She helped ease my nerves and help my daughter get excited about trying on options! She is incredible st what she does and her energy was amazing!! She defiantly made the whole experience once in a lift time!  My daughter tried on a dozen dresses in different colors and styles and finally found the perfect dress for her! They were able to tailor the dress same day for a reasonable price and we will be picking the dress up next week! This is a big deal for my daughter as it’s her 6th grade promotion and she is 6th grade class president and will be giving a speech so it was really important to my daughter that she find a dress that she loved! Thank you so much David’s Bridal and the whole team for helping make my daughters dreams come true!!  I cannot day enough about how amazing Carla is !! Please give her a raise she is wonderful< /Text>

When I first arrived at David’s Bridal Saturday January 6th at 12 noon it was so busy I had to wait about 15 minutes for my consultant Mina T. As she was finishing up with another customer which initially seemed eternal and I was a bit irritated  that I had to wait; However when she became available to help me she was a total pleasure to work with! She made my experience a dreamy and unforgettable one!!!!!  I noticed other consultants telling their customers just to ring the bell when they had found their dress and that was pretty much it, Mina T. In the other hand did it very different. When I found my dream dress she had me close my eyes held my hands and said the sweetest speech and then asked me to ring the bell! I couldn’t hold back the tears when she finished. In conclusion: I highly Commend Mina T. For making this experience one I will remember for the rest of my life ❤️ She was Definitely worth the wait and I am thankful my friend caught it all on video. Thank you David’s Bridal for your hiring criteria when hiring Mina T. Her expertise, soothing and sweet demeanor is perfect for a bride to be. Thank you!</Review>

Heather helped us, and she knew exactly which dresses to recommend once I shared my likes and dislikes. I ended up buying the first dress I tried on -- which was one she picked out! Definitely recommend this place. There's a big selection, and the staff is great.<//Review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>Alterations... nightmare.  With zero time to waste and a small budget I asked to not have the alterations rushed so I wouldn't have to pay the additional rush fees.  Then I received a voice mail from a lady saying that my dress would be ready on Friday (a week early). I called back to confirm that my dress was going to be ready early.  She said yes it's in the books for Friday at 6pm.  I normally get off work around that time so I had to get out early to make the appointment. I get there... NOT ready.  They said it was accidentally put in the books twice. They said to come back on Monday.

I call on Monday at 12pm and they don't know what I'm talking about. They confirm with someone and get back on the phone and tell me it will be ready on Tuesday at 11am.  I take half day off work, unpaid to pick up my dress.  I get there and the manager says she doesn't know who I talked to but the dress is not ready and probably won't be ready till the next day.  Still getting over the flu, exhausted, leaving for my wedding destination in just 2 short days and yet another wasted trip under my belt. I had to try very hard to keep it together.  Almost in tears.  She says she can drop it off for me but I had 3 other errands to run not including all my beauty appointments (nails, hair, etc) and I had no idea what time I'd be home.

I live 25 miles away from this store so I rearranged my schedule and appointments so I could stay near the store.  I gave them until 4:30pm to have the dress ready.  I returned and tried it on but they were not done steaming it yet.  They did their best to get me out the door as quickly as possible but never refunded me a penny for the horrible experience.

Two of the hems came out between the hotel to the limo to the Chapel.  Evidence of a rush job.  My advice is to look elsewhere if you don't have time to waste.  I don't think I've ever felt so stressed out before in my life.  I was even starting to think that something horrible happened to the dress and I was never going to see it again.  Horrible.</review>< pics>

<Text>If you want some “Say Yes to the Dress” BS this place is great for you.  If you would rather just find a dress without lady bonding vibes and dumb bell ringing, oh and over-priced dresses, I’d recommend someplace else.

We had an appointment on a Saturday.  There was no waiting everyone was very sweet and helpful,  even tho they were short staffed.  Rene was our bridal consultant and she was amazing not pushy at all, made daughter feel very comfortable.  And she found the style of dress she was looking for.  Thank you Rene< /text>

Our appointment was at 3:00 pm. We arrived at 2:45. The girls at the front greeting us were excellent. But, we never technically had our appointment. We waited until 3:30 for pur consultant to meet us, never happened. We started pulling dresses to try on, the girl that greeted us at the front saw us and came to help. She found us a dressing room. We did everything ourselves, and started asking other consultants for help. We felt bad as we were pulling consultants from other girls. We ended up finding a dress and purchasing it but it was not at all what we expected. We made an appointmemt but was treated like we just showed up without one. We never got that feeling of one bnb on one.</Text>

Dissatisfied with the service that I received at David’s Bridal in Costa Mesa! I did not have the full attention of the consultant that I was booked with. I felt like I was left alone for most of my appointment. I waited around a lot. I did not have the assistance that I needed during my appointment. I felt rushed throughout the appointment, especially since the constant’s other appointment time seemed to overlap with my appointment. If I could post this statement with zero stars, I would.</Review>

I had an amazing experience with my stylist Mina. She listened and helped me locate the dress I wanted. She was encouraging, thoughtful, and boosted my ego. Patient and kind to all my friends who came along for me. She helped me pick my dress and announced to the room, had me ring the bell so everyone could clap! It was a great experience!<//Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcdf39820ccf1d:0x418e1dde81487a7d</Gmap_id><text>During our original appointment the cashier scheduled our fittings for the bridesmaids dresses a mere 3 weeks before the wedding was happening. We all questioned it thinking that was not a ton of time before the wedding but they insisted this was the correct time to schedule. A week before the fittings we called to confirm appointments and that everything would be ready in time for a September 15 wedding. All of a sudden they’re saying we’ll need to pay more to have the fittings rushed since we didn’t schedule enough time and the dresses may not be done! So we gave them sh** and they agreed that it was their bad and that they would rush them for free *eye roll*. We picked up the dresses on the 13th and here we go:
- Over half the dresses had stains on them that were not there before
- The hems on the majority of the dresses were crooked and uneven. Many of the girls’ dresses were actually longer in the front than in the back and they were supposed to be floor length dresses so it was very noticeable.
- They could not accommodate pick up times for the dresses because they “had no appointments available” so most of us didn’t try on our dresses until the day of the wedding (me included).
- We paid $200 each dress and the seams were so cheap most ripped in different spots when we were putting them on and throughout the night.< /text><response>{'time': 1540572455977, 'text': 'Hi Kieran, we are sorry that your visit with us did not meet your expectations.

However, she was very to attentive to what I wanted and was super supportive the entire time. I couldn't have asked for someone better to help me find my dream dress! I had been to David's Bridal before, and this experience made me realize that the company isn't just about selling dresses, it is about making the bride feel special!  I couldn't be happier with my experience, and Maddie feels more like a friend then a bridal consultant. I highly recommend her and the staff that assisted her to  every bride that feels self-conscious about trying on a brides dress for the first time!  All of the stars all the way, thank you Maddie!< /Review>< Pictures>

I had a wonderful experience today finding a new wedding dress. I have been to other Davids Bridal but this location has been the best one specially the sales rep I was assigned too. Savannah was an absolute pleasure to work with. Her customer service was outstanding, she knew exactly what to bring me and most importantly she had patiences with me. I am definitely coming back and will be requesting her to help me find my bridesmaid and moms dress for my special day. Savannah u are a super STAR.. 🌟 and thank u for everything u did for me today.. We did find the perfect dress.. 🤗< /review>

My experience at David’s Bridal was magical. I felt so special. The staff was beyond nice/helpful/friendly! Vart was the lady helping me and she went above and beyond to do whatever it took to find me the dress I could say yes to! She was honest and funny, but, above all, she was very professional. She made my experience a time I will never forget! Thank you David’s Bridal and thank you Vart for being absolutely amazing!<//text>

We had a great experience shopping for a wedding dress for my sister. We didn't think we were going to find one so quickly. Stephanie assisted us and was great. She was very helpful and made the shopping experience enjoyable. I do want to mention that there aren't many choices for plus size bridesmaids. Very disappointing.</Text>

<review>Use caution when using any of their "vendors" that are inside the location that are marketing their services. Based on my experience I am assuming that David's Bridal does not vet them. I made the mistake of trusting this vendor because they were affiliated with David's Bridal and - WOW - BIGGEST mistake of my wedding that continually comes back to haunt me. I've been married since September 2016 and am still fighting to get the raw footage of my wedding (not even the finished video because I've given up on that). I am so disappointed and I regret ever going to this location to buy my flower girls their dresses based on how completely terrible my experience has been with the vendor I met here.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1518383420096, 'text': "Hello Stephanie,\nThank you for sharing your valuable time and feedback regarding your visit with our location.

When we first arrived there was little direction given to my bridesmaids. then we were basically left to find dresses on our own. when we asked for additional dresses to try on or sizes it felt as though we were irritating them.

She took the time to look at a ton of pins I had saved with various styles and tried every different style to narrow it down to what parts of each design I liked. Then she pulled the perfect 2 dresses and I had a tough choice to make. It was easy when she styled me with a hair piece and a veil— something I swore I wouldn’t wear as a second time mature bride.
The seamstress came over and went over what I would need done and the costs were beyond reasonable.
I was impressed with the variety of gowns and the high quality of the dress I chose. I had looked at a very high end store and buying a $5,000 gown did not make me happy. ..the price just is excessive for a dress you will only wear once for a few hours.
David’s Bridal doesn’t have mirrors in the dressing rooms and doesn’t serve you champagne but they actually all seem to genuinely want your dress and day to be what you envision.
I’m a bit of a label snob and David’s bridal may not be the most luxurious storefront to try on dresses but the service is exceptional and they have a dress for every type of bride. Ask for Madisyn if you want to find your perfect gown.</Review></record>

<Text>Consultants are  all 5 stars! Store itself is 4 star just because some of the dresses on the rack are stained with lipstick, makeup or have torn lace and are not discounted. You buy things right off the rack and it is all final sale so make sure you inspect your dress. Great place to find a dress though, lots of different styles and something for every budget. Consultants were great about pulling dresses that were only in my budget as well. I found most places will throw in a few out of your price range which I find cruel.< /Text>< pics>

They were all so nice and fun to be around but the lady who helped me was my favorite! Meshelle made me feel right at home ❤️ She was very kind and respectful and laughed at all my jokes 😊 She felt as if she was one my friends or family members there to help me find “the one” 👰🏻 And when I found my dress (after crying in it twice) she made me cry again before ringing the bell by reminding me of all the happy memories I have had with the love of my life leading up to the amazing moment of find my dress 👗 I can’t thank David’s Bridal, especially Meshelle, enough for making that day one I will never forget!! You made this bride truly feel like a queen 👑<//review>< Rate>

<text>I had my appointment with noelle today. She was absolutely amazing!! I had to take my daughter to my appointment and she totally helped me with my daughter while I tried on a few dresses. She definitely has a great sense of style and helped me pick the perfect dress. I didn't buy it yet because I went by myself (I didn't want my mom to be offended that I went without her first) but I have another appointment on Wednesday with her and I'm bringing my mom and she's going to help me convince my mom on the dress.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The assistant was very helpful and not pushy at all, wanted to help me find the dress I loved even if I was on a very short time scale and would check availability before I tried anything on to make the experience the best I could have.< /Review>

Yadira was our stylist and was extremely helpful and patient! My sister and I are both the brides to be and she managed to help us  at the same time so we could give input on each other's dress. We each tried on around 6 dresses, so in sum Yadira helped us find and evaluate 12 dresses total in 2 hours. My sister ended up choosing a dress that Yadira picked herself after noticing the kinds of dresses my sister preferred! Her sense of humor and kindness made an otherwise stressful task fun and exciting. And her personal touch and attention made it feel like we were at a small boutique rather than a large warehouse.

Other than that, I would advise to make an appointment ahead of time. We were walk-ins and had to wait for 2 hrs before we could try on anything.

Thank you Yadira!!!<//text>

I came in the girl on the floor put up some dresses for me to try on and disappeared. I was walking around looking for someone to help me since the dresses they gave me were so big I had to wrap the dress around myself to even walk out of the room. Then when I saw her she came up and told me she was leaving and someone else was going to help me then I was again having to wait, just to find out the other girl told me to wait because she was helping another person try on dresses. It wish I had the video footage of how horrible or non existent the service was. I dont even think they noticed I walked out of there, I was severely disappointed in the service and staff customer service. I said bye to one of the girls and she didnt even look up at me she just said ok, and kept looking at the computer. I'd never recommend to go there. Ladies I'd check out 4th santa ana, down town LA or Azazie online ordering. You will get good quality in materials and at least some service. Crystal Ditzler.</review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>As the mother of the groom, I can’t say enough positive things about my experience today. Zahra was absolutely amazing! From the minute I got there, she made the whole process seamless. She was very attentive, continuley checking on how each dress fit and bringing another size or dress. Zahra made sure I hade beautiful shoes, jewelry and a purse to match my dress. She even made sure I had sandals also that matched, so I would still look pretty after taking my dress shoes off. Caliee was also a big help. She was so friendly and helpful getting all my purchases rung up and packaged so nothing would get wrinkled or damaged. It was a great experience. I highly reccommend David’s Bridal for the whole wedding party.< /Review></record>

Super easy.  Found the dress in one day, super friendly staff, ordered the dress and received an email that my dress was in (3 weeks later) and I called the store to ask if they'd ship it to me and they did for free.  I decided not to use them for alterations, so I have no opinion regarding that.  However, the all around experience was great.</review>

I write very few Yelp reviews unless staff really impress me.  The staff at Davids Bridal (South Coast Plaza, CA) deserve a shout out.  I went in feeling down (I hate shopping).  I'm bustier at the top and nothing ever seems to fit right.  I tried on many dresses and I began to feel discouraged.  Marilyn was the sweetest.  She offered looking at bridesmaid dresses in ivory so I thought I would give it a shot.  I had mentioned that I was having a courthouse wedding and I didn't want anything too fancy so I was open to her suggestion (very smart if I may add).  Still nothing made me feel like "the bride."  I was looking in the clearance section because it was my preference.  She then asked if she could browse the section once more for me and she did it! she found my dream wedding dress!  She has an eye like no other.  She took into account that I wanted to show my cowboy boots subtly and that I wanted something to go on my shoulders.  Little did she know my cousin's baby actually helped in picking the dress too.  It was the first dress he was able to grab when we arrived and we took a picture just for fun.  After we didn't let him touch any other dresses once we realized he had been in grabbing range.  I wanted to tell her about realizing the dress she had helped me find was the same dress my baby cousin had grabbed when we first got there.  Sadly, she wasn't working the day I went in to alter my dress.  I would have loved to see her again.  Honestly, it all felt like fate and I'm so happy Marilyn didn't give up on me.  She could have let me go home but instead, she went above and beyond to make me feel special.

weeks later...

I came back for alterations.  Khanh was amazing and so was the woman who showed me to my fitting room (sorry I didn't catch your name)! she made me feel comfortable and made sure everything fit exactly how I wanted.  I did mention I wanted to alter a little more after she had just pinned my shoulders and she was more than happy to adjust what I wanted.  She had a welcoming presence when helping me and made it an incredible experience.  After alterations I was approached by Danielle M.  she was fantastic!  She actually got to know me and didn't make me feel pressured to buy a garter.  I had mentioned I was debating if I even wanted one and she proceeded to just keep me company and I got to learn about her vice versa (congrats again on the engagement!).

I was extremely satisfied with all of these ladies that had assisted me!  I know a lot of people they encounter may be frustrated or stressed out.  They deserve to know they made my "dress shopping" experience unforgettable.  It was something I wasn't looking forward to but thanks to them I am one happy bride.  Later I'll add a picture of my dress :) I just don't want to post it until after my wedding.

Thanks again!<//review>

I go in Monday they tell me its ging to cost  nearly $500 they then dropped it to $360 due to all the back and forth and lack of communication. I also told them exactly how I wanted it to be when they did a sample altering and fitting I wanted it to be going just above the ground. In addition to this I arrived today witches Wednesday December 19th a day before a plan that I made for an event and not only is the dress not how I want it to be it is dragging on the ground there was also a small lipstick stain on it as well and it took me a full two hours to actually just get out of there because I had to go in and out of the dress several times because they messed up on everything. Unfortunately I don't think I'm going to be getting bridesmaids dresses here I was very disappointed I had to talk to several managers and the manager of the alterations Department Shrugged off my request and really didn't take responsibility</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The all sales final policy is ridiculous, especially when online you have 14 days to make a return. I bought a dress there because I heard they had a variety of dresses and colors. The dresses are very low quality material, bought out of desperation. I lost the receipt therefore I never read the final sales policy but when purchasing the dress that was never informed to me. A week later I was able to find a better quality dress for a much better price at a department store.</text>

I had such an amazing experience with Stephany. She pulled dresses that were similar to the style I was going for and I felt like she was in my corner the whole time. When I was letting everyone else say what they liked or didn't like about my dress, she was great about bringing it back to what I liked and how I felt in it. She was just amazing. Thank you, Stephany! You made me feel very special.< /review>

<Review>Davids bridal has wonderful and friendly staff, with a wide variety of dresses. I was attended by Danielle Medina, she was very helpful and I trully loved her enthusiasm, energy and positiveness towards finding my wedding dress. She explained every detail and meaning of everything the bride needs and assisted me in choosing my dress and trying all the ones i had an eye on. I went twice and tried a total of 8 dresses. At the end of the second day, I found the perfect dress. I'm in love with it!! Can't wait for my wedding day!  No alterations needed and eventually got my vail plus extra items for the price of the dress. Great discount as well!! Can't forget about PK. The two times I entered she greeted my family and I with a smile, explained what i needed to do and was very friendly. If i had a question she was there to assist. Overall amazing experience at metro point davids bridal. Thank you ladies for all your assistance.😊😊<//Review>< user_id>

<review>Great first experience trying on wedding dresses here! Colleen, my stylist, was very helpful and so sweet! She found me two dresses that were the exact style I wanted but I couldn't decide with it being the first time I tried on dresses, but I already have a 2nd appointment to go back and will likely be purchasing one of the two! The dresses were more affordable than I expected as well! But the accessories were a little pricey and I did wish they had something bigger! I'm in the market for a big skirt with a long train and the dresses I tried were beautiful, but didn't quite have the drama I dreamed of. Other slight negative was I was given a goodie bag with some expired coupons in it, oops! Still in all a very positive experience and I'm excited to go back!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Over All, I understand working with brides, bridesmaids, and many others with particular needs to address, this area of work can be stressful and also hard to manage.

However, when coming in for my appointment I did not have an associate ready to help me, the attendant at the front did not explain the "choose a dress process" clearly and another associate made me and my bridesmaids feel like idiots for "not following propper procedure" which is no way to feel right before wedding dress shopping...

I will say they have a great selection and their dresses really do fit every budget. (Dress cost alone.)

Moving onto after the dress was chosen, we bought my veil and headpiece same day and ordered the dress to be delivered. A few weeks later I received an email stating "your special delivery has arrived" with a vague ivory description. Excitedly I called to confirm the arrival of my dress and set up an alterations appointment. I arrive the day of my alterations appointment and to my dismay there is no dress. Apparently there was "a misunderstanding" and the veil and headpiece were ordered and that is supposedly what had arrived for me previously.
3 questions here: A: Why if we were charged for the veil, headpiece, and dress the day of saying yes to the dress would it not be noted that we already recieved our order at the time of checkout?
B: Why is there not a description of items that have been delivered to the store?
C: Why would they allow me to make an alterations appointment for my wedding dress without confirming it was actually in the store?

The day of the unnecessary alterations appointment we were informed the dress wouldn't arrive for another 3 weeks when we were originally quoted 2-4 week delivery.

Upon the second alterations appointment everything went pretty well, however the turn around time for the alterations was 4-6weeks unless we put a rush order on it.

When we returned for a final fitting we saw how the dress was busselled and really did not like how they chose to do this. The woman who did the alterations explained there are miltiple ways to bussell a dress, however, none of these options were explained at the original alterations appointment. She said with the different busselled there are varieties of hoop/loops added for hooks to be able to keep everything in place and each loop would cost an additional $7/each. At this point I was furious thinking "If we were already paying for the dress and alterations why would we not want to pay an extra $21 for the bussell best suited for the dress?" Especially after we had discussed wanting the embroidery on the back of the dress showing after the bussell was finished.

In addition to this lack of communication, she went to start taking the Bussell loops out of the dress without confirming that we wanted to go ahead with the new Bussell changes. We did not end up making the changes to the Bussell because of the expected turn around and the "rush order" charge that we would have had to pay as well.

Over all, this process was way more stressful than it should have been.</Review><response>{'time': 1555705124681, 'text': 'Hi Hailey.

Macie the store manager of DB Costa Mesa is the most wonderful person. I am getting married in September and I bought my wedding dress back in November. After receiving my dress in the mail and it not fitting, and my taste changed... I wanted a new dress. I didnt think what I wanted was possible... Macie made everything I wanted all possible. She sat on the phone with me for over an hour while I ordered the correct products. She truly went above and beyond to help me. She deserves so much credit and respect. If you are getting married and looking for the perfect dress, go visit Macie or one of her team members at Davids Bridal. You will not be disappointed.<//text>

Very large selection of dresses. You get paired with a sales associates in order to try on the dresses, but they help you in/out of the dresses and everything. I found my dress with the help of Gabby C. and will recommend other people coming to this store, too.<//Review>

I came to this Davids bridal in an emergency to change my Vail a few hours before my wedding. I had been given the wrong Vail in Nebraska I called the store and since I was in California they really couldn't do much but tell me to call a local Davids bridal.

I went down to the store exchanged my Vail for the right one steamed it for me at no charge I was very happy with the out come of my situation happy bride on my wedding day July 23rd Tina the manager was also very sweet thank you guys so much !!!!!!< /review>

The store was definitely not what I expected. It was shoddy and run down. I was looking for a formal gown for a black tie wedding and, because I was looking so close to the date of the wedding, I'd have to buy off the rack. I totally understand that but when they say "off the rack," they mean it very literally. The dresses on the floor are not in good condition from having been tried on again and again and I was told there was nothing in the back. The dresses were not only not in good condition, they were overpriced, in my opinion. On the upside, Gabby, who helped me, was nice and helpful.</Review>

I was on holiday in Newport Beach (from New Zealand) with my parents and boyfriend, when he got his knee sandy on Laguna Beach and asked me to be his wife. Obviously I said YES, and since we were due to fly back to Auckland 3 days later, I wanted to start having a look at dresses as there is SO much more selection in the USA. Mum and I went for David’s Bridal Costa Mesa and made an appointment for me to have a fitting. I didn’t know what style I wanted or what would suit me. The amazing Vart asked me a few questions and within a few minutes had me in my first dress. I burst into tears when I saw myself in it. I tried on another six that she suggested before going back to the first one, and again, I burst into tears! Tears of utter happiness! She had nailed it! I couldn’t believe that the first dress I tried on was the one I would be saying “I do” in ❤️ I’m getting married at the beginning of December/in 7 weeks and I am so so thankful I went to THAT store and met Vart. She made saying “yes to the dress” so so special! It’s arrived in New Zealand even more beautiful than I remember!</Text>

<user_id>108488916682771960350</user_id><Review>First, let my start off... I went to the David's Bridal in Brea back in December to try on gowns for the very first time. My experience was awful. The consultant I was working with wasn't experienced, and that made me uneasy. She kept pulling dresses that were not flattering, and was not listening to anything I was saying. I went in on a Sunday, which of course was a busier day but still. I left there with a bad taste in my mouth.

I decided on a whim to make an appointment at the south coast/metro pointe david's bridal to give it another go. I went in on a Friday morning, so naturally the environment was less stressful or hectic. My consultant Carla was awesome! She was handling two appointments at the same time but was still giving me better treatment than at the Brea location, and she was much more knowledgeable about sizing and styles that would work better on my body. She was very attentive and helpful. As a fuller figured girl, dress shopping can be a little bit daunting because sample sizes don't typically work in my favor. But Carla really worked with me and helped me find dresses that were my style and looked good. I highly recommend this location if you are starting your wedding dress hunt. I specifically recommend Carla.< /Review></record>

After explaining the situation they agreed to give us a discount or fix it right away and deliver it to us personally. we needed the dress for that night so we chose the latter. they give to us 30 minutes before we have to leave only to find that the stitching is horrendous and the dress is uneven! they said to call back if we werent pleased. so we did and they sent the call to voicemail. called again and they ignored the call. had to wear a different dress not chosen for the occasion because of them.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Never expect much when I have to shop here.  The sales girls, while nice, are always overbooked and overwhelmed.  Even with an appointment we had the sales girl attention for MAYBE the first 10 mins.  We didn't need much help but it would have been nice if we were checked on more than once.  Like I said, I don't expect much from anyone at this shop.  Very busy and always chaotic.  Happy with my dress.</Text>

Absolutely  the worst service Ive ever had. I had an appt at 12, showed up on time and was told that all the consultants  scheduled multiple appts at noon also. Finally at 1230 and after asking  twice, my consultant found us. However she thought i was a bridesmaid and someone else. I only tried on 1 dress  even though i told  them when booking my appointment  I need long sleeves. She looked through one rack and only found 1, and then dropped off the dress and left to go help another bride. I left in tears by 1245 completely devastated  that i drove  up an hour for the this appointment just to be treated like  garbage. NEVER COMING BACK DO NOT  GO< /Text>

I decided to go to Cost Mesa to look for a wedding dress. I didn’t have an appointment, so I had to wait. While waiting, I selected a dress to try on., but unbeknownst to me, I was not suppose to carry around the dress. I was made aware of this by a rude employee who had long black hair (didn’t get her name). At that point I wanted to leave, but I talked myself out it. I was glad that I did. I guess I looked upset because shortly after the manager came over to me and said that Madisyn would be helping me. The minute Madisyn began helping me, I knew I was in good hands. She is extremely knowledgeable, patient, and professional. Working with her was worth the 56 minute drive. Thank you Madisyn! You’re the best.</text>

everyone was really nice - just not very present. I was trying on bridesmaid dresses and someone was there to help me with one of them. It was mostly an easy in and out with some attentiveness.</Review>

<Review>After a long day of searching for the perfect dress at another shop nearby and in LA I decided to call David's Bridal last minute for an appointment. I honestly should have gone here first! I called in at 4 and was told they could take me in at 6pm. As soon as we walked in we were greeted very nicely. Even when I was waiting for my consultant since they were pretty busy, other staff made sure to ask if I had been helped already. Then I finally met my consultant Mina. She was amazing!! Really friendly and listened to what I liked and didn't like from each of the dresses I had pulled out. I didn't like anything I had chosen so I was starting to loose hope. Then Mina suggested a couple of dresses. First one I really liked but I wasn't getting that "wow" feeling. Then I see the second one, seeing it on the hanger I wasn't liking it too much, but as she started taking it out I started looking at the details and once I put it on it felt so comfortable and a perfect fit (still hadn't seen how it looked on me) I walk out and see everyone's reaction. I excitedly look in the mirror and to my surprise it was the one! Completely different than what I had in mind so I was shocked, but I knew that was it! Mina did their David's Bridal say yes to the dress tradition and the stress was over! Haha I definitely recommend brides to be to go here first! They have every style of dress, plenty of sizes, and great prices! I got my dress with all the accessories minus the shoes for half of my budget!<//Review><date>1491754602210<//date><pics>None</pics>< rating>

<Time>1517592781120</Time><rate>5</rate><review>I was happy with my experience at David's Bridal Costa Mesa and specialist Vart. Making an appointment and checking in was seamless. I went in with ideas of what I wanted but also with an open mind allowing Vart to pick what she thought I may like. In the end, I fell in love with a dress of her choosing that I never saw online. If I wasn't traveling home to the east coast to do the whole shopping experience with my family, I would've bought the dress right then and there.

One thing - I was dying for a drink after all those dresses. I realize they probably can't offer a variety of refreshments and probably need to keep food and liquids away from dresses. But it would've been nice if they offered water at least.</review>< Pics>

<review>While the selection is great and our first stylist was super nice, she was helping another party during the time we were there. I had an appointment, but there were multiple times I was left in the dressing room, just hanging out, not trying on dresses, while she helped the other bride. It was frustrating and not how I imagined my experience would go. By the end, I just wanted to be done, but was handed off to a different stylist. It was clear that they hadn't really communicated about my wants/desires because the 2nd stylist asked me all the same questions again. At that point, I was done and decided to leave without finding a dress. I think if I were to go back to this location, I'd rather wait for the stylist to finish with the other bride before she starts with me. It wasn't fair to either of us.</review>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>I had a terrible experience here. Not only was the place dirty but they came down to the wire getting my dress in. I was told I would get a call or an email when my dress arrived. With less than 2 weeks until the wedding I started to get nervous that my dress was still not in. I called on a Tuesday to check on the status. I was told that my dress had already arrived. I told the girl I was never informed, and she brushed it off and said the email went into my spam mail. Then was completely rude and asked my availability to pick up the dress. I told her I was leaving town the next morning and I wasn't sure when I could make it in. With complete attitude she told me that they require the dresses to be picked up within 10 days and it had been delivered the previous Friday so I needed to pick it up by Friday. I had to scramble to find someone to pick up my dress for me since I was leaving town. I also rechecked my emails and I received nothing in my inbox or my spam. Luckily my friend was able to pick my dress up on Thursday after I called.  The day after it was picked up, which was 10 days after it was delivered, I received an email telling me that my dress was available for pick up. I will never buy a dress here again. The staff made me feel stupid and like an inconvenience even though they didn't tell me my dress was delivered until after it was picked up.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I had a wonderful experience!

Madisyn was a doll and made me feel comfortable, was patient, and was helping other girls too! It was a fun environment and truly will remember this experience forever. I was at a loss and really thought I liked a certain style of dress. Every dress I tried on I wasn’t feeling it, and they were all the ones I had my heart set on!

So after both sets of dresses I picked out, Madisyn asked what else I wanted to try on. I had no idea, and said surprise me. She came back with a wildcard group, all dramatically different than the ones I tried on. The first one I put on from that batch was the dress I ended up buying. It’s beautiful, perfect for the outdoors, and I never even would have glanced at this dress because of the price and the color.

Well thank you to my nana for the help paying for my dream dress, and thank you to Madisyn for really listening to me and what my wedding was going to be - and finding my dream dress.< /Text><user_id>103303344020325866047< /user_id>< gmapID>

<text>I had a scheduled appointment for my daughter for her debutant ball gown.  The girl helping us was not knowledgeable about their own merchandise.  We shared about 5 pictures of style options my daughter wanted to try; this included 3 their own dresses. Our budget was $500-$700 we told her upfront.  She wasn’t “getting it” on style, and couldn’t find dresses I’d showed her pictures of.  So I started looking through “plastic covered dresses.” Their sample section does NOT have all their dresses available.  I found several in the plastic covered dresses.  Plus, I happened to find some on sale in that section!  My daughter tried on 5 dresses.  I had to fluf/spread the gown every time.  The salesgirl only clamped her dresses to size. And, that wasn’t even done right!  She’d clip the bodice crooked every time!  Never offered shoes, gloves, or hair pieces to finish the look.  My daughter settled on a dress.  Prior to purchading, our organization requires verification the dress meets standards.  WELL, that store had sold that dress to another debutant for the same event!!!  We asked this question, she said no one had it from our group!!  Starting over!  Going to the other nearby bridal store!  Done with David’s!!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I am soooo disappointed in my purchase, alterations and experience.  People were friendly however claim that they had the solution  for my daughters debutante dress but did not and spent much more time trying to find the right solution but did not.  I spent over $500 dollars in alterations, had more than enough time to get it completed but still did not.  I went back to pick up her dress several times different solution all the way to the day before.  Made what was suppose to be a very special moment to a mother's worse nightmare.  Very very very disappointing with tears of sadness versus happiness!!<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1484669512851, 'text': "Hello Shelia, we are deeply sorry that your recent experience with us was less than satisfactory.

If I could give them no stars I would, my stylist left me to help another bride, she the sent someone else to help me which kept bringing me dresses that were ugly or to big. Then the manager came to help me n got called away for a issue in the front. By this time I got myself out of an ugly dress in to my clothes and told my mom lets leave. I literally left almost n tears. I don't understand why any of this happened the whole time I was nice n friendly so it's not like that's why they weren't helping me. This was my worst experience as a bride and I will never go here again.</text>

Let me focus on Madi! She found my dress and took the worry away! She was hands on and made me feel confident and trusting. Absolutely, recommend Madi as your consultant! ❤️

I’m takin one star for honesty - the first fitting person was not friendly and wasn’t forth coming . I had to ask all the questions to get what I wanted to hear about my dress being fit for me . I hope and pray she does what was promised to me when I bought the dress . I have one more fitting .

My stylist for my bridal appointment, kristen, was great. She pulled dresses in my budget and pulled dresses just like the ones I had envisioned.

However.

It is not fair to your customers, nor is it fair on your employees, to be scheduling two brides at a time for your stylists. I spent a large amount of time during my appointment just waiting around for her to come back for my next dress. It wasnt her fault, because she was doing her best. But it made my decision to purchase my gown elsewhere easy--your scheduling made me feel like you dont prioritise anything but your bottom line. I've seen your responses about other complaints on here, about it being the busy season... it doesnt matter. It's frustrating and tacky. I would advise you to stop doing it.

Second--when I called to cancel my follow up appointment (since I found my gown somewhere else after leaving David's), the phone said that it was transferring me several times. Then the automated voice told me that there was no one to take my call and hung up on me. There was no way to leave a message. I dont like to no-call, no-show... but if I can't cancel my appointment, I'm not sure what else you expect.</review>

<Review>The sales agent I was assigned to was also assigned to another bride, I felt I didn’t get much help.  I requested for another dressing room because the area was crowded with lots of people.  They’re also not able to order dresses from online to deliver to their store for try on.  Limited styles and size availability<//Review>< pics>

Melissa was nice and helpful. That's it. The store and product was a disappointment. I shopped here with my bridesmaids and was appalled by how dirty and unorganized the store is. This is not a reflection on the sales girls, but the company in general. The dresses my bridesmaids tried on were also very low quality for what they were trying to charge. I would not recommend this store to ANYONE. I would just be too embarrassed to associate my name with this walmart of bridal shops. Go anywhere, but here.<//review>

<text>This review is for the stylist, Yadira, who helped me find my dream dress. To be honest, I did not think I was going to find a dress here, let  alone, purchase my dress the day I went in. I had initially found my dream dress at another bridal boutique but it was on the higher end of my budget so I wanted to shop around. I saw that David’s Bridal was having a sale so I figured why not check it out?

I’m so glad I got Yadira because the moment I showed her a picture of the dress I wanted, she immediately knew which one to pull for me. It’s not the same designer but the style is so similar, you can’t tell they’re not the same dress. She also pulled a few more of the ones I had asked to try on. She helped me get into and out of each dress and also put the veil on me each time. She also brought out shoes for me to wear so I can see the dress with height and also brought out a corset bra to try on with some of the dresses.

At the end when I knew I was going with my first choice, she helped me pick out accessories and even put the necklace on me so I can see the entire outfit. I had the complete experience. She really took her time with me and was so patient and helpful. She is the sweetest. We hugged afterwards because we were super happy I was able to say “Yes” to the dress that day.

I didn’t want to go shopping for the dress, didn’t want big wedding, it was for my mom and fiancé he wants it!! Madisyn (Kings fan) and me Ducks fam came together for the day lol and she put my mind at ease. Didn’t pressure me, tell me this was only dress , I waited too long , it’s hopeless finding a dress I’ll like (Simply Bridal did that). She was the exact opposite asked my budget, what I wanted “white and not to trip” I don’t ask for much and she came through! She even told me about dresses my bridesmaids get a discount with. All great price and look! I highly recommend David’s Bridal, coming from someone who lives in a hockey jersey and jeans! I did say yes to the dress for my mom and fiancé James! The things we do for love, right !! Madisyn you are an asset to the company and an expert at what you do, you listened and didn’t put me off or my wants aside. Thank you Kimberly< /review>< pics>

<Review>My Sister's wedding is coming up in June and she chose to go to Davids Bridal for the price of her wedding dress.  So, consequently we had to order our bridesmaids dresses here as well.  I wanted to scream for my sister.  When she was trying on dresses the lady helping her was so rude.  They double book for one thing the entire floor was empty and they had 2 bride to be crammed into one space sharing one mirror section with 10 people stuffed in chairs to view both brides.  They are very unprofessional.

The only positive ray of sunshine in the place was a young woman that I found restocking dresses who actually knew the stock better and was very helpful.  I think I offended the sales woman who was helping us by preferring to get advice from the stock girl.  Eventually the sales woman asked her manager to come over and help out.  I think that she could tell that we were very frustrated.

My sister almost started crying the experience was horrible.  She did find a dress and wouldn't you know it was the very first dress that she asked to see from a picture she had and the very last dress that they managed to find for her.  They did not listen and tried to up sale her many times with dresses that did not even look similar to the dress that she wanted.

Now my experience…….This is how I felt…..Like I had to Hurry up and try my dress on after all we were just a bridesmaid…..obviously, they did not say that to us I guess it was derived from the look on her face and the sigh from the sales girl.  No help at all I had to get my own dress with the other 5 bridesmaids and basically make the sale for them.  THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!

I called a few days later because I was unsure of the sizing and the lady on the phone replied..."I am about to go into a meeting I will have to call you back"  basically saying.....Oh since you have already given us your money we will get to your question when it is convenient for them.  So, here I am waiting for them to call me back to answer a question.   They did call back an hour later and the person I spoke to was helpful but was rushing me in my conversation and I did not get to ask her both of my questions.  It seems like they have an abundant amount of calls due to problems…..I wonder why that would be???  Her answers were definitely memorized and she was spouting off scripted excuses to a dress possibly not fitting properly.  I will let you know how the dress is when I go to pick it up at the end of April as promised.

PLEASE try and go somewhere where you're wedding party will feel special.  Especially, since you are asking your friends and family members to spend a large amount of money on your behalf for you're wedding day on their dresses.  You owe it to yourself to have a pleasant experience as well!  So chose another place any other place than South Coast David's Bridal in Costa Mesa, CA!< /Review>< Pictures>

I was very disappointed in the customer service we received me and my bridal group went looking for bridesmaid dresses and even though we had no appointment the lady in the front said no problem someone can help us....we waited 10 min then someone came and asked if we needed help we started trying on dresses but the lady seemed annoyed and was helping another group....every time we asked for help or a clip she just seemed like we were asking too much...also she sized all my girls wrong they did not even try any sizes the lady told them so very unhelpful...they should of just told us make an appointment because we got poor service< /review>

Ok, I'm a big, older woman.  Does that mean I shouldn't get the same kind of service any sweet, young thing gets?  After putting 2 dresses in a room for me, the girl "helping" me disappeared....never asked how I was doing, never asked if I needed any help.  I got dressed and walked out.<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I regret that it did not go so well for me, I asked for my appointment in the Long beach store, and since I was very kind, when I asked the girl who attended me, she would show me the models in particular, she changed her treatment and only brought 2 dresses, she left me alone and went to attend another girl who had arrived without an appointment, with the help of my friends I was able to measure 4 dresses of which 1 was to my liking, and since they did not have it in my size, at that time I opted for visiting the store that is in South Coast Plaza, where Yadira the girl who attended me was Porto incredible, I told her what I wanted to spend and she brought me several dresses that were on sale, and all the time she was very attentive, I left happy and satisfied , hoping that the day of delivery will arrive, and today unfortunately when I picked it up they gave me a super wrinkled dress in terrible condition, of course when I complained they offered to iron it, telling me that it will return in 1 hour, after hour and mean that I come back I was surprised by Receiving it the same, the store manager put on the pretext that since he had not had alterations they could not deliver it ironed, and that they had a lot of work, to which I responded angrily that they were nothing professional that that was not my problem, that they would hire more employees, it is incredible that only the person who pays a dress of more than 900 dollars, plus the alterations and accessories are those who can enjoy good service.😣

Lamento que a mi no me halla ido tan bien, pedí mi cita en la tienda de Long beach, y desde que entre muy amables, al pedirle a la chica que me atendió me mostrará los modelos en especial, cambio su trato y sólo trajo 2 vestidos, me dejó sola y se fue a atender a otra chica que había llegado sin cita,  con ayuda de mis amigas pude medirme 4 vestidos de los cuales 1 fue de mi agrado, y como no lo tenían en mi talla, en ese momento opte por visitar la tienda que está en South Coast Plaza, donde Yadira la chica que me atendió se Porto incredible, le dije lo que queria gastar y me trajo varios vestidos que estaban en oferta, y todo el tiempo estuvo muy atenta, salí feliz y satisfecha, esperando que llegará el día de la entrega, y hoy lamentablemente a la hora de recogerlo me entregaron un vestido super arrugado en pésimo estado, porsupuesto a la hora de quejarme se ofrecieron a plancharlo, diciéndome que regresará en 1 hora,después de hora y media que regrese me encontré con la sorpresa de recibirlo igual, la encargada de la tienda puso de pretexto que como no había tenido alteraciones no lo podían entregar planchado, y que tenían mucho trabajo, a lo que yo enojada respondí que no eran nada profesionales que ese no era mi problema,que contratarán más empleados, es increíble que sólo la persona que pague un vestido de más de 900 dls, más las alteraciones y accesorios sean las que puedan gozar de un buen servicio.😣</review>< pictures>
