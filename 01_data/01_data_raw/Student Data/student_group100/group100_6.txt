Best 9-hole golf course in Sacramento Valley. Driving range is usually open late hours under lights. Nice practice area too< /review>

rushing us not seeing they were a group ahead that was still in. The fairway I’m guessing his buddy went and told him to rush us due to right after they took they’re time to hit watch for that old guy he’s rude and should not be working in the pro shop he should be on cart detail other then that they promote it as a family place but if my kids was there an we got rushed I would have lost my etiquette” as well

Pros: the place is beautiful 😻 I mean legit it’s worth what they charge the range is really nice the grass is beautiful flushed Green a few hard holes 4,5  even six can be difficult on a bad day 😆but the course it’s well maintained minus the incident I’ll give credit we’re it is due one person won’t change the beauty of this place it’s definitely awesome!< /text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1616005114526, 'text': 'Hi, Rastah.

First time at this establishment, was a little confused as to where to go purchase a bucket of balls for the range, but with very helpful and courteous staff, I quickly found My way to the cashier and was on My way to go smash some golf balls! I was kind of disappointed only two of the stalls had Tee's available and theose were already taken. If anyone can give Me a tip on how to get some of those at the Clubhouse id definitely be back real soon! Thank You!</text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>First time here. Amazing course.
Overall, grounds were well kept. The greens are in fantastic shape.
Lots of water for a 9 hole course. A couple of tough fairways on the longer holes.
All in all, a great place to spend a couple hours verifying how good you think you are, or not. 😁
Will definitely be back.</review>< Rating>

Nice nine hole course and convenient location off Hwy 99 in Elk Grove with cheap green fees with plenty of hazards to challenge all aspects of your game...only draw back it's not a 18 hole track but always has great course conditions 🏌️‍♂️⛳👍</text>

The course is always in very good condition, which based on the rates it should be. The driving range offers either mats (with overhead cover) or grass for your choosing. A nice chipping green will help tune your skills from grass or sand and the practice putting green offers contours to provide a challenge.< /review>

Nice course.

Not much thought went into the covered driving range.  The golfers get no protection from the Sun, just the onlookers. They would have to move Tees back 10 feet to get shade.

They  need misting units on the carts to make it bearable to play during the day.<//review>

< Review>
Decent driving range, has 3 sections: Covered artificial turf tees, grass lesson area, and grass area for irons only. Problem is if you actually want to practice your drives you have to be at the covered artificial truf tees, and furthermore you need to have your own rubber tees for them as you are not allowed to practice drives in front of them.

If you try to tee up in front of them you will get talked to in a very condescending way by an employee even if you are very nice about it when they ask you to move bacm. Quite frankly it put a damper on my whole experience today as I don't have rubber tees and there's not really a way to set up wood tees on the turf pads so I was unable to practice my drives.

Also the last time I came here was the first time I had been here in years so I went to the pro shop to ask how things worked around here and the employee looked at me like I wasn't very bright and was rather condescending during our interaction. Maybe its because im 21 and they arent fond of people my age, but I don't know. I say this because they seemed cheery with others that were older. However I will say other employees were cheery when they came around to pick up range baskets and I brought my baskets over to them the previous time I was here.

Besides the employee interactions I've had and limitations on being able to practice your drive, its a good range with an automated ball vending machine where you can pay with credit card and get 4 different amounts of balls to choose from at reasonable prices. If you can do it, it's easy to hit for multiple hours at a time. You do want to come early though as the range and parking lot fill up quick.

Also I wish there were more target like things to hit at. It can make practicing different distances kind of boring as its mostly just flags at longer distances.<//Review>

Short fun course! The atmosphere is great and the layout is fun. Greens are nice and slick. The course will force you to use almost every club in the club, especially the short clubs. Good place to practice your shorter clubs and to get your accuracy down.</Review>

<text>Wonderful little 9 hole facility. They also have a nice short game area with bunker.  The day we went the greens were fantastic, 12 on the stimp according the staff.  I actually ran into a D1 collegiate golfer who said often the greens are quick. Excellent option for a quick 9.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809abf2d1766f82b:0x8813e767524fa7d5</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Don't expect the best course in the world. It's a little cramped and, if you play like me, you'll often see your ball enter the fairway of another hole. Still, for a quick 9 holes, it's definitely a fun place, tucked away in a corner of Elk Grove.< /text>

I loved this course, until my last visit. We had a big group and several first timers. We let any one that caught up with us to play through. Yet the management decided we were being to slow and gave us a hurry up chat that totally spoiled our day.  I paid for the whole party as a gift for Christmas and they completely ruined the day.   I will never go back!!<//review>

< review>
Great 9 hole spot to work on your short game.  Hole 5 is a lot like the 17th at Bartley Cavanaugh in south Sacramento . . . a par 3 on a little peninsula that requires a fairly accurate strike with your pitching wedge to avoid water all around it.  Great for walking.  Very busy on weekend mornings with clubs, tournaments and First Tee.  Best bet is afternoons and weekdays.< /review>

<text>I've played this course since it opened over 20 years ago.  Since CSD took over it has improved more and more.  Greens are wonderful but tough. The NCGA rating has gone up.  The staff are really friendly and community oriented.  The flooding that was an annual problem isn't anymore.  The proported "writer" is absolutely wrong!  Duffers Arise!<//text>< rating>

Great course if it wasn't an executive course it would rival delpaso or valley.< /Text>

The course isn't very challenging but it does offer about every obstacle a golfer will encounter on difficult courses. A great place to practice or learn golf.< /text>

Buster, my did, and I love walking to this location almost daily. When kids are not out on the baseball field, he can run around chasing his ball. We both love this. We also like to watch the children on the playground and pickle ball players on the courtyard.< /text>

This park is small. There are homeless peoples hanging around baseball bleachers and surrounding area. Restroom maintenance is subpar. There is a little area you can picnic or relax . It is a mini park.< /Text>

Owner takes good care of his property. Better prices than other car wash businesses. Spot free rinsing leaves my old car looking so good that people as me if I got a new paint job! Would recommend this place to family and friends!< /Text>

Love this place. Have a nasty tree that gets my car super dirty. I like going to spot free because it's only $2 to rinse off my car for 3.5 minutes. Convenient entry and exit.< /review>

I like that you can use a debit or credit card.Its $2 to start with,then it charges a few cents by the second.It stops at 12 minutes,for a total of $20</text>

<text>So glad I called Loural Towing last night when my son and I were stranded with a puncture in our tire that left us stranded on an exit ramp in Redwood City. They were there within 10 mins of calling them, towed our car to their shop where they patched the tire so we could get home safely. They took great care with my car the entire time and were very professional. We were off after 45 mins after calling them.</text>< user>

Called in and got a tow truck to arrive in 30-45 mins. They showed up on time and the guy was super nice. Price to tow was super cheap too. I highly recommend this towing company to everyone!< /text>

Far lower price than any other quote I got. Had to get my vehicle towed twice (once to a shop, and then again to a different shop). Both times, the drivers were excellent. Always sucks to have a car break down, and they were very understanding and kind.</Review>

These guys are the best I got a flat and destroyed my tire stem.  I called the auto club and they sent loural towing.  On a lark I asked the tow truck driver if he had a tire I could buy and he called his shop and sure enough they had a used tire that was perfect for my car.  It only cost 45 dollars and I looked at the tire a few days later and it is a nice premium tire.  I totally appreciate the tow driver and the shop for getting me back on the road that day.  I was able to complete my trips and get my bonus from uber.</review>

This is the best towing company in the bay area. They always give great service for a good price. I would definitely recommend anyone to come here. They always arrive within 30mins or less of calling. Don't contact any other tow company just call loural, I have used them multiple times now and have never been disappointed.</text>

These guys are thiefs are liars.
My car broke down and I called their  services.
The place I intended to take it to was closed so they offered to fix my rims/wheels/tires. They promised they were going to have it ready within 2 days and with the new wheels the car was going to be fine, however it took them more than a week, I paid them over $700    and the car was far from being ok, it was shaking and when  I took it back they said I nedneea new: axel, suspention, cross member, etc etc. But they only quoted me on the wheel and tires and that was separate, so I asked, why did you tell me it was only the tires then? If I would had known it needed all these extra stuff, I may have or not fix it.
I was angry, but there was nothing I could have done, so two months later I asked for a receipt and they had the balls to tell me that if I wanted one I had to pay them $40 for a copy of it. That's how bad they are, they won't have your car on the date they told you, they will charge you for something and when that's not the problem and they will charge you for your receipt.<//review>

I am so happy I found this place. I ran over a nail in my brand new car and was losing air quickly. I was just around the corner from this place and it was a busy Saturday but he made sure to help me in a timely manner! I was there for less than an hour with a fixed tire and warranty. Not to mention they offer military discounts! Everyone was super nice & make sure you are happy before you leave. With it being my first time going there, they even fixed my tire for free! I  will definitely be coming back.<//review>

<Review>I took my car here to Oceanside Tire and Service Center  to get some badly needed brake service. When I got there, I was immediately greeted and asked, what can we do for you today. I let them know what I was requesting. As I was waiting for my wife to come and pick me up, one of the Service Techs came in and let me know that there was more to my issue then what was discussed. I then gave them the go ahead to Service my vehicle. Though it cost a bit more then my wife and I anticipated,  I was greatful for their honesty. The price I paid was reasonable and the car works great now. It is hard to find good and honest mechanics. But, in the future I will bring my cars back here for any work or further maintenance issues arise.

I made an appointment, and when I arrived at my appointed time, they were ready for me, ready with the parts that were necessary, and got to work immediately.  The quality of work exceeded my expectations (WAY better than what the dealership has been doing), tge work was done in less time than they estimated and my bill was lower than the quote.  Under time, under budget and a superior product- not really sure how much more I can say!  Except, every person with whom I had an interaction was kind and professional - none of the stereotypes about upsetting or making me feel dumb for not speaking "car".

Maybe the best compliment I can give is that this shop is almost 50 miles from my home, and I will never go anywhere else.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<text>We have been going to Oceanside Tire and service for many years. We know we will have quality service done by skilled mechanics that we can trust. Ron and his crew go above and beyond to make sure our cars are in top running condition. We are very grateful that we have a good reliable place to bring our vehicles for tires, brakes, oil changes and the list goes on!</text></record></dataset><record>
<Text>Had to come in and plug a tire that had a nail in it.  The other tire places had at least a 90 min wait, but when I called them what the wait time was they said it would be about one hour.  Since they had the lowest wait time and was about a mile away, I decided to drop by and have my tire repaired during my lunch.  When I got to the place, there was no wait, took my car, and my tire was fixed in about 30 min.  Pretty fast service.< /Text><name>Art Cabuang< /name>< pics>

I’ve brought my own tires in and they mounted them with no question.  I recently purchased tires through them online and they held them for over a week until I could get in.  During the alignment process the tech pointed out an issue I could fix myself instead of charging me for it.  That’s honesty right there.  Plus they support the Semper Fi Fund for our Vets.

These guys blew my socks off. These guys went out of their way to fix someone else’s botched repair job. Over and above service, outstanding work.
Thanks guys, strong work. Me and my family have a new favorite shop.< /text>

They performed an oil change well enough. They seemed more in a rush to get people in and out making money than to take care of issues. Had to find a different shop to fix the 2 broken studs they found when they rotated my tires. They were too busy and I could try to walk in during the week if I wanted to.</Review>

<text>All was good except I arrived before 8am and just needed my new tire mounted. I needed to get to work, in San Diego. It was 1.5 hrs. before my car was ready after being told it would be 45 min to an hour. The garage doors were open at 10 till 8 when I pulled into the lot, every bay was already filled. Did me no good to arrive early!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< gmapID>

Called in for a minor service and these guys did me an unexpected solid. Won't say what so nobody tries to take advantage and replicate their having done a cool move but I will say this, I know where I'm getting my next set of tires! Thanks man!< /text>

If there were more stars, I'd use them.  Ron, the owner, was great with customer service. My case involved the wrong tire bought at a Tire Pros from another state, and Ron called them personally and got after them for selling me A/T tires for a touring van (the only ones they had), and is working on my refund for them. My new Coopers are great, quiet! Recommend this shop to others. And I'll go there next time. Update: It's now next time. Ron and Louie took care of me with a flat tire. Five stars again. They are fast and I trust them.</Review>

I normally love this place.  Been coming here for years. Yesterday was the exception. The guy behind the counter could not have wanted less to do with me. He wasn’t rude but he wasnt the guy you want customer facing.  Also they apparently have a “mask exemption” which means everyone in the shop has some “medical excuse” not to wear a mask.  Every customer I saw was being responsible in wearing a mask. Not ONE single employee. This is a deal breaker for me personally. I’ll be taking my business elsewhere going forward.  🙁<//Review>

<review>We had the tire pressure warning light on as we were heading back to LA. It felt like a flat tire so we brought our car to this shop and they examined my car very carefully. They spent around 20 mins to check each tire and told us it was due to low pressure in some of the tires. They pumped the pressure for us and the warning light went off. We were going to pay for the labor - they did spend some time looking, checking and carefully examining. They kindly told us it’s FREE of charge. It’s extremely rare to have this kind of business that doesn’t charge you even they did do work and spend the time. This place deserves good reviews!< /review>< Pics>

I took a set of brand new wheels and tires to be mounted balanced and aligned and they damaged my brand new wheels.  The scratches are clearly a pattern and caused by their alignment machine.  I picked my vehicle up in the dark and didn’t see the scratches.  Owner and techs were nice enough to deal with but if you care about the appearance of your car, find somewhere else to go, I certainly will be.< /review>

<Review>So far with few times I’ve gone here, they’ve always been very professional and clear about what it is that needs to be done and how it will be done. The owner Ron is generally available if you have any questions or doubts regarding what’s going on and when I’ve had questions he’s taken me to lift area to show on my car what was wrong and explain it thoroughly so I could understand. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone needing work done on their car, basic or advanced work.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I stopped to have my battery checked out told the advisor that it was low and what the problem was he was not very friendly and not a people person he had the battery checked out and said it was fine I told just to prorate it out and I would get a new one he said it doesn't work that way and sent me on my way I went to the store came out after 5minutes battery dead found someone to jump me and took it back them and the advisor was unmoved by what happened then told I will check it out again but it would probably read ok but it failed and he had to replace it still never spoke to me I felt it he doesn't like dealing with the public or people maybe he needs new job I would like to talk with management on the matter but the techs where very helpful so not all bad<//text>

We went to another tire center prior to our visit at Oceanside tire & service and we are so glad we did! Our whole experience was awesome! The customer service, along with keeping us updated on our car was amazing and they had our car ready way earlier then the estimated time. We will definitely be returning for all our tire services.< /review>

<Text>I had four new tires put on my car but I noticed that one tire was sticking out too far in the rear. The supervisor kept telling me it was the alignment. I took off work and I brought the car back in to replace that rear tire with a new tire, in case that was the issue, but the problem persisted. Rather than taking ownership of the problem and trying ti troubleshoot, the supervisor again said that it's the alignment. I took the car to an alignment shop and they found that not only was the rear tire mounted incorrectly, one of the fronts was also off - and nothing was wrong with the alignment! In fact, Oceanside tire had mounted a front tire on the rear wheel and a rear tire on the front wheel. I took more time off work and brought the car back to Oceanside Tire to give them a 4th chance to make it right. Instead of taking responsibility for incorrectly mounting the tires, the supervisor said he was going to have to charge me MORE for fixing the issue that they caused in the first place. I asked for my money back and the supervisor said the owner isn't in that day and only he can do it. They did change the tires in the end but only after I argued that they should fix the problem they caused. Zero ownership of their work, zero quality assurance and zero customer service. Highly advise all to avoid this place if they have any care about their vehicle.

For reference, I have a 335i BMW that has stock staggered wheels/tires, which is why they can't be rotated front-rear. Something that a professional tire shop should know, or at least be able to troubleshoot.</Text><user_name>Kyle Kuhn< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My first visit for a routine oil change. I was very impressed with the check in process to watching the complete inspection of my vehicle from brakes to checking for any leaks, tire rotation and battery check. A very thorough process it gives me greater confidence in my vehicles future performance. I will definitely be going back for my next service and or any needed repairs.<//Text>< username>

Great & speedy service! I had to get towed over due to 2 flat tires. They fixed me up in a jif by repairing one tire that had a screw and assessing, then adding air to my spare in no time for a reasonable price.< /text>

I have been going here off and on for years. Once I got my Jeep that’s lifted I took it here after I was told at some other place I needed a bunch of stuff replaced that didn’t seem right and for a steering issue. Ron and his crew inspected it and informed me the other lace was lying. They did the work that needed to be done on my Jeep and kept me informed the entire time. The service here is truly amazing! I will keep going back.< /Text>

They replaced a broken hub my rear brakes (that were almost totally gone) and a tire ( that had a nail in the side wall). Not only did they get me to Oregon on time to return to work but they did it at a reasonable price as well !
I told him that I heard a noise while I was traveling on the freeway.  I was returning to Oregon that day and that I did not feel safe traveling that far with the warning lights on. They got me in without an appointment and took care of the issues. They even stayed over to get it done so that I could get back to Oregon in time to return to work.
I made it home safely and I’m able to return to work as scheduled. I huge thank you and God bless to everyone at Oceanside tire and service Center. One very thankful Oregonian.
Sincerely,
Rainy Gross< /Text>

Long story short... my spare got a flat after getting a flat. I called around 10am, they were able to order the tires I needed by 3pm and had my car done by 4pm.
EXCELLENT friendly customer service. Will definitely return!</Text>

Terrible!!! Tried charging me 3000 for upper ball joints and talking me into extra work that wasn’t necessary!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!<//text>
< resp>
{'time': 1612044295836, 'text': 'Sorry to hear you feel our estimate was terrible. I believe there is a communication error regarding your estimate and your response here on google. We inspected the whole suspension front and rear and provided a estimate for multiple items not just your upper ball joints. The estimate for upper control arms which includes upper ball joints and alignment was $748. The vehicle requires lower control bushings, lower ball joints, shocks front and rear with stabilizer links front and rear. The total estimate was $2800 for all the items on your 99 Tahoe. You can chose what items you want to do or not but in no means are we talking you into extra work we are just providing the facts with a quote. We value your business as we do all of our customers if there is anything I can do for you please contact me.'}</resp>

What a great place , everyone treats you like your the boss. Good prices great work, and the job gets done right the first time, no extra parts added in.  It's nice to find a shop that you can trust, I've just stopped in to have a low tire check out, they did no charge and it wasn't even there tires. That's why I went back and will again .
Thanks Oceanside Tire

<Review>Horrible customer service from a white male skinny with a mustache

Rude , took longer than told , had a little attitude the whole time , and I’m literally a welcoming friendly person , even was nice to him at first , but by the end of the transaction I was dry and annoyed . Did not even thank me for my visit just said “yup”
Then on top of that the tires were extra dirty and they were supposed to be “brand new” did not Discuss warranty with me at all, also my tires were at about 5 psi when I checked them right after purchasing them

Spend your money elsewhere where they actually appreciate you dropping $400 for there business< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1579116694259, 'text': 'We are looking into this matter and be in contact.

I have purchased two sets of tires from this company. Each time I was given excellent and friendly service. Not only will I return here for more tires as needed, but for other repairs and services as needed. Finding a quality and professional automotive business like this, is a jewel to find.
I will gladly refer this business to anyone who ask.
Regards, very satisfied customer.</review>

< Review>
Amazing & friendly service. Got a flat at the start of a busy day and needed to be back on the road asap. Fella behind the counter (can't remember his name, great ink though) checked out the tire, and, when it couldn't be fixed, had one of his guys drive to go get a new one from another center rather than wait for regular delivery. I was back on the road with a new tire within 2.5 hours and prices were really fair.  Highly recommend.</Review>

Great, honest service. And my car was evaluated within 10 minutes if that. I have a regular mechanic but I’ve been taking my car here more often for servicing. And I appreciate that it’s a military veteran family business with unabashed patriotism👍🏼</Text>

He still rotated my tires and told me what the issue was and price. He didn’t charge me for my rotation. I didn’t end up getting the main issue fixed but I will definitely come back when I can. Honest man and an honest place. Highly recommend and wish there were more places and people like Ron.</text>< pics>

< Review>
A very good experience,
I walked in and I went to the wrong area where “Ron” was, he asked how can he help? I needed a battery and a state inspection. He said he could help with the battery then said that I would reset the system if I replace the battery, and to drive it for a few days to get accurate data for the inspection. So thanks for the advice man, very appreciative.<//Review>

< Review>
HIGHLY would not recommend Oceanside Tire and Service Center to anyone needing vehicle maintenance.

I’ve been to this shop a few times now and have never been too impressed with the service I’ve received. However, after my last visit I’ve lost all trust and dependability in this shop. I will never be back, and will encourage anyone who needs vehicle maintenance not to come here either. If you’re looking for dependable and professional service, invest your time into looking for a better auto shop.

Story:

I dropped my truck off on a Saturday afternoon after my check engine light had came on. Throughout the week I had to keep calling to receive updates on the status of my truck. I finally received a call first thing Thursday morning saying my truck was ready. I ended up picking up my truck at about 3:30 PM on Thursday. On my way home I noticed my plastic engine cover was just sitting in the back seat. When I got home I opened the hood to begin putting my engine cover back on when I noticed the part they had replaced (the PCM) was just dangling there only being held on by the electrical connections and my old PCM was still bolted in. I wasn’t able to call the shop until Friday afternoon to get an explanation as to why my old PCM was still there there and why my new one wasn’t properly secured. Friday at 2pm I called the shop and explained the situation, they were shocked at the news, mainly because they had no clue my truck had even left their shop and didn’t know who signed off on it as being completed. They informed me that my truck still had work to be done and should’ve never been released to me. Their biggest concern wasn’t that I bring it back so they could finish it but that they needed it back so they take out my old PCM because it was worth $300 to them.

My problems with the situation:
-They let me drive away with an unfinished vehicle.
-I paid for a service that wasn’t completed.
-It took for me to call them before they noticed my vehicle had left their shop.
-I had to waste more time and effort bringing my truck back to the shop so they could complete it.

I dropped my truck off on a Saturday, a week from when I first brought it in, for them to complete the job. Once my truck was ready the owner handed me the keys and gave me a simple: “sorry about that.” Due to all that had happened I asked for compensation of money on labor fees. The owner was confused on why I wanted compensation and told me the job was done. Was the job done? To an extent, Yes. However, it wasn’t done timely, it wasn’t done the first time, and it definitely wasn’t done with professionalism. I felt I had paid for a service that I didn’t receive. The conversation with the owner just ran around in circles and after I had explained everything the owner still had no remorse and wouldn’t compensate me for anything.

I’ll never bring my vehicle back to this shop. The customer service was poor, the experience was unprofessional, and the service was unreliable. I hope people take the time to read this review and go elsewhere, it’ll definitely be worth your time, money, and effort.</Review>

These guys did a great job repairing a screw we had in our tire on the way to the beach. We were in and out in 45 minutes! I’m proud to support a fellow Marine Veteran owned business that also does great work!</review>

Just went and had my new rim put on my old tire by them a couple days ago. I had visited them prior to inquire if they were able to do it, and the gentleman working the front was happy to come out and look at my tire for me, and also made some calls to see how much a rim would be through them! I had already asked other places more nearby to me if they could do it, but ultimately I chose to go back to Oside Tire and Service because of their initial wonderful service! When I returned I again was very happy with my visit and know I’ll definitely be returning for any of my car needs! This time Ron helped me, and he was awesome as well! He came out to my car carried my new rim and old tire for me, and was just very helpful with my situation! Oceanside Tires and Service has amazing prices and service!<//review>

Very friendly people but unfortunately I did not have a good job done on getting my truck aligned. The tech doing my alignment drove my truck after his work and I could hear the tires squealing as he turned corners, knowing that doesn’t sound correct for any vehicle that just got aligned he parked my vehicle out front and said it was complete. I was told 45 minutes once I dropped my truck off and was out of there after about 2 hours.
Friendly but didn’t get the service I’d hoped for leaving me to go somewhere else and get my truck realigned.</Text>

<Review>was quoted 60 for 2 loose tires(not on car) to be balanced and mounted. lil expensive but it's close so I decided to give this place a try. Discount Tire said 52 at the door with tax. I never received a call letting me know my tires were done and it was $68 out the door. For not having to put my car on a lift and saving them the time I would expect some type of discount but $70 for two small tires seems a little expensive, I'll be using another service next time<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dc70c1cdeb8a87:0xcb699d4216378587</gmap_id></record>

My 06 Winnebago View RV had aLF tire was ready to blow plus my starter battery needed replacing. I Googled RV tires and this shop came up. I was thrilled as they are located very close to where I live so didn't have to drive far on a seriously dangerous tire.  From the call, to meeting in person, I appreciated and liked dealing with Ron.  My motto is "never do business with someone you cannot communicate with".  He was excellent, didn't act too busy or condescending as I'm senior female.  I have background in automotives and this is one of characteristics I could tell who I knew  I would want to do business with. I would recommend him for any tire or battery need. He stocks Interstate batteries which are popular with RV owners.  I understand they do mechanics also.  I would give him a try.</review>

That was nice to take my car to this place they did exactly what I wanted The Price was affordable they give me a little heads up on two different things that the car needs. But overall I get out very satisfied with the service.</text>

I took my 75 Camaro to them for an alignment after I installed all new front suspension and steering components. The car now drives as straight as an arrow and the cost was quite reasonable.</text>

Never disappointed when I bring my Chevy Avalanche in. The guys are all great and knowledgeable and their prices are reasonable. I would refer all my family and friends who are females to go to them. They don't try and rip you off because your a female like some auto repairs like to do.I trust them to do a great job and so far they have done a great job! Went in for a fuel system cleaning, my truck runs powerful and eats less gas than before I took it in! Great Service and Great Price!!!<//Review>

<Review>The team at Oceanside Tire and Service Center are the very best! I used to live in Oceanside and moved to La Mesa and still drive to this shop. They know what they are doing and stand behind their work. If it's not done right, they do it again. It's amazing to find this kind of service in this day and age.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>This place has great customer service.  Also, in 2011, I witnessed them give a free brake inspection to a guy with a lot of miles on his car.  They told him that his brakes were fine and his car was in good shape.  They didn't suggest and unsolicited maintenance.  I am sure that guy will come back again and again.  It made it so this is the place I go first when I want an honest opinion.< /text>< Pictures>

< review>
Been coming here for years. Always courteous, professional and easy to work with. Two weeks ago, I needed a new battery. They had one in stock and even though they were booked up for installation, Joseph did not charge me a core fee on the purchase since I had to do my own installation at home (could not wait a day), and he knew I would return my old battery.

On another visit, they discovered an issue with my air-flow intake and proceeded to fix it, even taking the time to make sure the replacement part came in quickly the next day and fixing my vehicle that day.

Of course, they have taken care of my tire needs for the last 10 years. Very happy to do business with these guys. Ron and team always standby their work.</review>

This business was top notch the moment they picked up the phone at 7 PM on a Sunday night. I had a flat tire that I replaced with a spare. They did not have I kind a tire I wanted in stock on Sunday 5/12/19. They said they can order the tire and have it available for me Monday morning before 10 AM and to bring my car in at that time. The gentleman who I spoke with Sunday night I don’t recall his name, however I went into the shop Monday morning at 10 AM and saw Ken.  The special ordered tire was installed on my car in less than 35 minutes! And he saved me more money and I was originally quoted.  Anybody within a 25 mile radius who wants any work done on their vehicle including tires, Hass to go see these guys. If you don’t you’re not going to treat yourself to one of the finest experiences i’ve ever dealt with in 49 years!</text>

<Name>Guy Robinson< /Name><text>Got suckered in the old BAIT AND SWITCH game.  Thought I was getting what I had paid for.  Ended up at the end of the day, holding the bag.  The parts I paid for were not what I had wanted put on my car.  This repair shop overcharges and under delivers.  Even after trying to resolve the problem, I got no satisfaction.  Ask for the exact parts and part # that are being installed , take a minute and google the part for a description and a price.  Like me I paid $400 for $100 worth of junk car parts.  Econo is what they are call,  I like the word JUNK.  Look elsewhere for a honest repair shop< /text>< Rate>

<Review>Not only cheapest place for some truck tires, but we showed up as they were closing and we asked if they could get one more, the guy asks his boss and they were but they didnt have enough workers so instead they kept it over night and got to it first thing in the morning. Great friendly service.</Review>< Pics>

<Time>1511197810298< /Time><rating>1< /rating><Review>I brought my car in on Saturday to get a new tire because my front left tire was balding. I called Oceanside automotive and spoke with someone who said i could bring my car in at noon and they would have it done for me within the hour. Took my car in and came back about 45 minutes later and my car was finished. Now this would have been perfect. I went inside and paid ($135) and left to go home. As im driving home i noticed my "low tire pressure" light was on *THIS WAS NOT ON WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN*!!!!!!!!!!!! I call Oceanside Automotive and the guy said well you usually need to drive 40 mph in order for it go off. I drove around for about 10 minutes and it never went off. I went home for about an hour and came out to go pick up my son from school and my tire was low, like almost flat looking. I took my car back to Oceanside automotive who agreed it was low. The actual mechanic who changed my tire jacked my car up and took the tire off to see what was wrong. He said he found that the valve stem sensor part was broke and is causing the tire to leak air. I was so frustrated because i tried to explain to the mechanic and the guy who worked the office that, that light was NEVER on before i brought it in and both mechanics basically said it was my fault and maybe it was just a coincidence it happened at this time, which is total bullcrap. He quoted me $80 dollars to get it fixed. The mechanic tried to tighten it but the next day it leaked air and was low again. So I'm driving around with a $135 new tire that cant keep air because of something that was not fault of mine. I just can't give this place anymore of my money and its so unfortunate because i have been bringing my cars here for the past 10 years.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Took my 4runner in for a valve cover gasket replacement, and find out about 6 months later they messed up and oil has been leaking into 2 of the spark plugs chambers and eventually caused the engine to misfire. I recommend avoiding this shop.< /Text>

< review>
Jim, the service writer,  ALWAYS  goes over the top to take care of the customers!  I wait in the lobby while my car is being serviced, so I watch him and the repair ppl in action. I believe Jim and the rest of the gang have the customers best interest at heart, he’s not trying to over sell repairs or products to benefit the business.
I’ve also been in the lobby and watched a customer go sideways when told what it was going to take to repair her car.  Obviously, the  unexpected news took her by surprise and she became really upset and took it out on Jim.  He camly tried to give her an explaintion but she was too angry to listen. What do you bet she’s one of the negative reviews.
if you’re looking for a trustworthy mechanic you can bet these guys will take really good care of you.</review>

Brought my 2009 Chevolet Malibu into Oceanside Tire and Service Center to get a wobble in the front end checked. Technician suggested struts, so we bought new struts and did a front end alignment.  Wasn't happy with the struts and the owner said no problem.  New struts are being installed at no charge.  And another alignment included.  Who does that today?  Service manager is excellent here, explained everything in terms of cost and importance.  Didn't do any of that upsell BS.  Actually worked on getting the costs down to what I could afford

Well was I wrong.  The "Owner" ordered and installed the CHEAPEST STRUTS YOU COULD GET.   My car drives like a bounce house.  Lost the performance I bought the car for in the first place. What I paid him I could of gotten high performance suspension all around.  I stopped payment and reported him to the BBB.  BUYER BEWARE. Ask for a explaination of the parts being used.  Are the OEM grade or a sub-standard replacement part.<//Review>

< Review>
Great dinning experience. Started with the Calamari, lightly fried with 2 different dipping sauces and the bruschetta. Both were most excellent.
Ended with the Chocolate mousse and Apple tart. Along with an Irish coffee. Curious and helpful service. We loved it all.<//Review>

Excellent dinner!  My lasagna bolognese was one of the best I have ever had at an Italian restaurant and this establishment is first-rate.  Everything was good here when I visited, from the fresh-baked bread, down to the Caesar salad and my entree.  VERY satisfied!<//Review>

Lovely Italian place right off the main drag. Tons of parking nearby but can fill up fast. Menu changes frequently (including the specials) but the fish (Sole, Salmon, etc) is top notch! Fresh salads and deserts. A great place to take a date.</review>

The food tastes excellent, but on several occasions I have found bits of metal and broken knives in my pasta. Moreover, I am a vegetarian, and I have found beef in my pasta the last time I went to Spalti. The lemonade is not fresh and tastes cheap.< /review>

A friend and I shared the grilled polenta appetizer and each got a ravioli dish that was a daily special.  It ended up being way too much food.  We could have easily split one appetizer and one entree, even though he has a pretty healthy appetite. The food in any case was excellent.

The restaurant was a bit too dark.  Also, the women's bathroom bizarrely had a full length mirror facing the toilet.  I've never seen myself going to the bathroom, and that certainly did not improve my dining experience.</text>

<review>Great little hidden outdoor patio that you should request if you are there on a date. They make their ravioli old school big and round. The filling was delightful. The sauce was tasty and had just the right balance of acidity.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

Nice Italian restaurant. They can do "al dente" pasta. I don't know why they are not crowded every time I was there - I guess maybe I was there at 6pm.< /Review>

< Review>
My wife and I came here for lunch because of a Groupon offer.  We gave them the coupon before the meal and they accepted it.  But when we got our bill, we found out they didn't apply the coupon.  We asked them about it and the waiter said the coupon's for dinner only.  We asked him to reconsider, he talked to the manager and we ended up being able to use half of the coupon towards the bill and save the other half for dinner the next time we go, which I don't think we will.  I wasn't happy about how they handled the Groupon deal, they should've told us before hand that it's only good for dinner.  And they should've applied the entire coupon towards our meal.

The food itself was not too bad.  The bread and dipping sauce they serve with it is really good.  I got a salmon risotto and I didn't like it.  It was too bland for me.  My wife got the spinach ravioli and she really liked it.</Review>

I basically accidentally walked into there last night. I had intended to go to some junk fastfood place nearby, but somehow, this ristorante attracted me, so I sat down and had dinner there.
I had bruschetta (con pomodoro e basilico) for starters and penne spalti. Both tasted fantastic. The food was authentic italian, not the usual american italian variant, which means it was a lot more to my taste.
Service was very good, too. I really recommend this place.<//review>

<name>Chandi Shumnum< /name><time>1592337540709< /time><Rating>4<//Rating><text>With the plandemic forcing me inside, I found myself needing to lose the vast amounts of plastic bottles and other CRV rented trash sprawling over my kitchen floor.  Today I ventured to the recycling place that does not make you take the caps off your plastic bottles.  A visit to Northstate Recycling was new to me, I drove in past a chain link fence and got in a small line of cars.  The industrial setting is like being in a Mad Max movie for 10 minutes of your life, a field trip for adults getting ready for their dystopian future that looms ahead.  The gritty warehouse feel with mechanical contraptions, I could almost picture Jawa's pulling droids apart for scrap.  For me this was better than waiting in parking lots with tiny sheds, hoping the pirate looking guys to process me through.  Northstate Recycling seemed to work better for me, the recycling buisness is a dog collar job by nature, but who does want to get their CRV back?  In Redding the bumican-american subcultures visit these places for their paychecks, it's like a dirt mall corporate office.  Definately not a place to bring your date, just bring to bring the wine bottles you shared with your date.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x54d2ea2c772d66c1:0xcd55c94ed7e4fd28<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I do believe this company is on its way out  You reap what you sow ,i googled number 2 copper Scrap Average price $2 a pound,  this company only gives  $1.05,  4 300 pounds of copper , Not to mention a couple 400 pounds of brass , Only 15 cents a pound Better off to throw in the garbage 😯.Should've asked 1st. Thay   used to be very fair to deal with. that's why  I did not ask, Sacramento pays $1.98 a pound. I will talk to our local assemblyman to see if these companies can start posting their prices like gas stations.. Real crooks as far as I'm concerned. Don't go there. They were the company that was fine for her to 400,000.00 I still a for  400, pounds of number 2 copper, That I'll bring to Sacramento.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

This company has had very helpful and dilligent workers willing to help with your recyclables if they aren't bogged down with customers..which they usually are lol. I've been going to Shorts for several years and I've only experienced smiles willingness to help and a fair deal.< /Review>

<Date>1469159787253</Date><Response>None< /Response><Text>Today I went to Northstate Recycling to redeem both aluminum cans and #1 plastic bottles as a fund raiser for a non-profit organization to which I belong.  We had collected a number of both.....in fact over 140 lbs of cans and about the same of bottles.  The attendant checked us out and gave me the receipt to take into the office to be paid.  Our total pay-out was just over $88.  Knowing that aluminum cans are currently over $1.60 per pound I questioned the clerk as to why we received so little.  I was then (after the fact) informed that since we had more than 100 pounds of cans we were paid scrap metal prices....... 20 cents per pound!  According to the clerk this is required by state legislation.  That does sound like something our state legislators would do, but I am quite sure that the attendant who checked us out was aware of that fact.  I would think that in an honest business the attendant would inform the customer of this fact and give them the opportunity to turn in less than 100 pounds.  Our total on just 100 pounds of aluminum cans would have been $160.00, as opposed to the $29 we actually received for the whole 145 pounds.  I would have been better off to have given 40 pounds of cans to the person in line behind me......I'd have walked away with more money for our organization.  In fact, my husband was with me and all the attendant would have had to do is to inform us of the rule and we could have divided our cans in half and each received payments.  I am amazed that a business that has been in Redding for such a long time is so obviously dishonest in their dealings with the public.  I don't know if the policy is displayed for the public to see, but if it is I can say it is not prominently displayed.  Beware of the business practices of this company.  If they can cheat you, they will.</Text>< GmapID>

Maybe Monica should start keeping up on new state laws and learn how to read multiple notices posted around the property, rather than blaming someone else.</Review>

<text>I WISH I COULD RATE THIS FURNITURE STORE ZERO STARS!!!!  DON'T NOT BUY FURNITURE FROM THIS PLACE!!! THE WORST!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! WE BOUGHT A 5 DRAWER DRESSER AND PAID IN FULL WITH CASH. THE PERSON WHO HELPED US WAS JOHN. HE TOLD US THAT HE WOULD RECOMMEND US TO ORDERS US A BRAND NEW ONE SO THE ONE ON THE FLOOR WOULD STILL BE THERE FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS TO SEE. SO WE AGREED. JOHN SAID TO PICK UP THE DRESSER ON TUESDAY BETWEEN 10-7 PM. WE WENT TUESDAY AND THEY TOLD US DELIVERY MAN WASN'T THERE WITH THE SHIPMENT TO COME BACK ON WEDNESDAY. WE CAME BACK ON WEDNESDAY AND AGAIN YUP!! AGAIN THEY TOLD US THE EXACT SAME THING. SO WE CAME BACK ON THURSDAY AND GUESS WHAT THEY TOLD US THE SAME THING!!! AT THIS POINT WE JUST WANTED OUR MONEY BACK. WE NEVER RECEIVED A COURTESY CALL TO LET US KNOW OUR FURNITURE WOULDN'T BE THERE FOR PICK UP.  3 DAYS IN A ROW WE WENT TO THIS HORRIBLE FURNITURE STORE BUT NEVER GOT OUR DRESSER. WE ASKED TO GET OUR MONEY BACK AND JOHN SAID THAT THE OWNERS WEREN'T IN AND HE COULDN'T GIVE IT TO US. WE HAD TO GO BACK THE NEXT DAY TO GET OUR MONEY BACK. THE WORST PLACE TO SHOP!!< /text>< Pictures>

This is the most terrible furniture store in California, the employee does not know English, they are very rude to the buyer, I bought a sofa and have been waiting for 3 months, I went to take money back, they have not even changed, I warn everyone do not go to this store if you do not want to waste money and time  ....<//Text>

I bought The Hollywood Bedroom set and it totally said "ME!"...customer service was better than Lame Living Spaces....Loan was great with me...I was unsure about my purchase but with the addition of a 5 drawer side dresser and still in my budget...My friend and I walked around to see the Living Room furniture and I know I will be back for that as well...I recommended Fine Living Furniture to anyone 👀 looking for different and attractive furniture...You will not regret it...oh the delivery guys were just as nice!!< /text>< Pictures>

This store has a bad customer service, the furnitures are made with poor materials, they came up with excuses that doesn't make sense.
Bad experience.< /Text>

Great Experience!  It was great to see formal quality furniture.  I even had a chance to view fine furniture by the best known designers.    The service was superb and I found exactly what I was looking for to style my dream home with the furniture that I visioned.    My home is now home😀< /Review>

We ordered a queen mattress set & wrought iron bed.  The service was great from the moment we walked in, we were kindly greeted & they were very helpful in assisting us and showing us furniture.  The prices are amazing and they arranged delivery for us within a great timeframe.   Our overall experience was GREAT!!  They came through for us delivering wonderful furniture when other stores didn't.  I'd recommend this store for sure. 😊< /text>

<Time>1492200248752< /Time><text>I had a very good experience with this shop. I fell in love with a couch but it was too big and they explain to me that it could be completely customized to fit my area and space, it came out perfect it is so comfortable and just the right size. We also ordered a dining table from them which is a very lovely table and the price you couldn't be I found it at other stores like Sears excetera and the prices were outrageous compared to what we paid. Great quality great prices delivery and set-up was awesome I would definitely recommend it and I will continue to shop there for other Furniture needs.<//text>< user_id>

The sales people were very helpful. We bought a buffet to store extra dishes and needed it to fit in a specific location with tight measurements. They set up delivery for us. Everything worked out beautifully!< /review>

Overall good service. Initially, they did not have sufficient sales staff in the area to serve all of the waiting customers. I waited until they could bring someone else to the sales floor.  After purchasing,  the loading staff seemed to forget about us and served other customers  ( who had arrived after us).</text>

RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!!

I purchased over $1000 in furniture. TABLE RUGS, A BUNK BED. When the bunk beds were delivered they did not have the support boards.  The driver told me to call in and they would deliver again that day.....

That is where the problem started.  I called in they said that the boards were a separate purchase of $200.00  WHAT!!?!?!?!?!?!! Isn't that part of the bed????

I bit the bullet and went down there a few weeks later.  They refused to sell me the boards on credit.  They stated i had to purchase $500.00 or more.  I showed my receipt from the last time I was there.  Not good enough. After haggling for fifteen 20 minutes I asked to speak to the manager.  They said he was busy.  i was upset at this point and went to his office and knocked on the door until he answered.  HE TOLD ME TO LEAVE AND GO TO WICKS FURNITURE.

Oh, and the drivers who dropped off the furniture left all the boxes and bubble and trash (food wrappers too) in front of my house.

I ended up going to LOWES and buying the boards for $20.00

* UPDATE: 8/17/16  WHAT A COINCIDENCE THAT THERE ARE ALL THESE "5 STAR" REVIEWS IN THE PAST WEEK.  NOTICE NO COMMENTS....FAKE!!!!!!!</Text>

i purchased a king size mattress and it was at the location in Orange city, on Santa Clara and Tustin, but I guess they had the mattress at this location I went in on a Wednesday and they said they would bring it in from this location in 2 days and they were right and they were so nice especially the cute old man that helped me put the mattress in my truck , love this place, they are so patient there.i will probably go to this place more to purchase furniture. Prices are affordable king size mattress for 300 pretty good if u ask me</Text>

<review>Purchased a dining table. Price was $150 less than the lowest price I found other places via internet search. It was delivered 2 days after ordering and was in new condition. I would definitely purchase from them again. FYI- there is an additional cost for delivery and setup.< /review>< Pictures>

We had a great experience purchasing our bed and dresser with LoAn. She made it very easy in helping us to decide with our purchase and not only the customer service when purchased but also the delivery staff including the manager who were very careful funny and helpful I would definitely continue doing more furniture purchases with fine living

I'm glad I don't work for them anymore.. crooked company that sells sometimes used items to customers and tells them that it's brandnew... So so sad... I use to work there and trust me... I would be mad sometime when they tell me to just lie to the customer that I deliver to... I'm like wow!!!! And all of a sudden .. these 5 stars ratings pop up so fast...  what happened to all the other ratings that? I mean isn't  it breaking the law to pay people to submit false ratings??? Hmmmm???? Well idk... but for anyone who ventures to the store make sure the things you buy and when it's delivered, make sure it's what you order and pay for... and not a used and repackaged or refurbished item... good luck...< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>This is my youngest daughter's favorite pizza place, so I am required to review it. I really like the sauce they use, but sometimes the pizza is a little salty for me. The price is good and the delivery is quick, or if you order in the lobby the wait time is relatively short.< /review><response>None</response><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>Three strike and you’re out.  Delivery was late and a no show my last two orders.  I understand these are tough times and didn’t want to come to any conclusions.  This time I thought that I might have a better experience if I picked up the pie.  No such luck.  They had given my pizza to the wrong person.  Then to make matters worse, when I asked for a packet of parm cheese and red pepper flakes I was charged a dollar each.  I opted not to make the purchase.  I only have myself to blame.  I should have learned after the first snafu...<//text>< Rating>

<Review>Worst experience we’ve ever had.. we ordered a pizza at 7:12 it is now exactly 2 hours later and the pizza never arrived we called them an hour and 40 minutes into this order and it was indicated that the meal will be arriving within 10 to 15 minutes we called again it was indicated to us that the order had been canceled because we were new customers and they needed to have credit card payment we have made many many orders for about five years to same  address , we are very disappointed with the service we are not eating there again.</Review><Name>Young Amano<//Name><user>109743556913079585157</user><gmapID>0x80c2bb2b824cf9c3:0x48849d0cdd2b11fa< /gmapID>< Resp>

<Review>I've been ordering from this Santa Monica domino's for years and I have had very few issues with the food I receive. And if there is a problem they are quick to correct it. The pizza is good and the cheesy bread is addicting. Who doesn't love hot melty cheese and bread.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Horrible service I asked for a bread bowl and they gave me a regular chicken Alfredo. They didn’t even give a receipt so we couldn’t complain. I would give this 0 stars. I don’t recommend!</Review>

The Domino's app and website are fast and easy to use. The people are always friendly, timely and professional. And oh by the way, the pizza is great EVERY time. Domino's has really pulled its act together these past few years. I'm a huge fan, not just of my local store but of the brand overall. Great tasting pizza and overall experience at a really good price.<//Review>

The first two orders were placed in February & March, 2020. Surprisingly
much better than I expected. But the last three orders were horrible. If they don’t get it right tonight with the baking (past orders came undercooked),preparation
& amount of toppings (3 leaves of spinach and 3 sad mushrooms for entire
pizza), I will not order again.

I am using the refund of the last pizza
tonight, but it does not feel like a good deal because with delivery charge (again, for replacing the bad pizza)
taxes, service charge, tip (not delivery person’s fault), tonight’s “free” trial was over $16!!!</text>

From the moment  you step in this place  team give you an enjoyable feeling. Very courteous hosts, it is a happy restaurant to hang out with friends and colleagues or with your date. Great  cuisine, experienced  chef, reasonable  pay and excellent  service. Highly recommended.</review>

<Response>None<//Response><user_name>Gisselle V.</user_name><Text>Horrible service. I come to pick up my order and I gave them two $20 dollar bills for an order that was $26.00. I give them my name and this worker takes my money, puts it under the keyboard, gives me back $3 and NO receipt and walks away. I stay there and I ask them politely that they owe me money, that I gave them $40 and the worker who took my order gives me attitude saying no they don’t and that I gave $30. I say, “ma’am I gave you two twenty dollar bills “ and she keeps telling me I’m wrong and it’s not until the manager comes and tells her “yeah she did give you two twenties just give her change”. She doesn’t even say sorry or give me a receipt , she just hands me the rest with no apology. Learn from my experience, take your money somewhere else or a different dominos and don’t let them fool you.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I've been coming to this Dominos for a while now and I've NEVER had a bad experience until today. One of the cashiers was helping me who was very nice, I gave her my name and she went to go get my order but an asian girl came, asked for my name but I told her someone was helping me... she rolled her eyes and told me to move to help the person behind me.

It's good pizza. Can't say it's worth the long wait. It's small space. There's a long line. Overall decent pizza. Good to at least try but out.< /Review>

This is my favorite dominos, compared to other ones I’ve been to. Very high quality and they almost never mess up what you order. Lots of dominos I’ve been to tend to put very little toppings and sauce, but this one doesn’t do this. They also are very fast at delivering. It’s my favorite place to order pizza in Santa Monica. They are very consistently good.</text>

Edgar was very kind, respectful, helpful and went above and beyond typical level of service to satisfy our requests. Pizza was hot, delicious and exactly as ordered. Thank you for delivering a great meal. We will be back many times in the future.</Review>

Only complaints are they close for carry out at 10 pm every night, probably because the worst people in the world hangout in that shopping mall. Great dominos though.< /Review>

<Text>Good customer service. When my pizza was wrong, they made it right. Great delivery.

However, there is zero consistency. I've ordered from there three times. First time was perfect. Second time wrong sauce. Third time my pizza was swimming in Alfredo sauce. The toppings are actually running off. It's really disgusting.
Plus the crust is different Everytime, even though I order the same kind each time.

My pizza is $30 a pop, so I kinda feel like there should be a better quality control system happening. Tonight was my last attempt at this location.</Text>< Pics>

After I got my pizza I walked towards my house through the alley and I saw weird movement coming from a WHITE MALIBU CHEVY with a Dominos sign. The driver was kissing a girl and it was so uncomfortable, why in the alley and in the car? Especially if you’re on the job with a dominos sign on your car. The manager needs to keep her employees on check.<//text>

Was here today for the first time .I order online about i arrive at store 45 minutes later pizza was not ready I was ok waiting .I picked up my pizza 15 minutes later i checked my order to make sure it was correct first pizza was half burned and my second pizza was not correct .I asked lady in front to fix my order ahe was ok with it with attitude and i also asked for them to change the burned pizza since i was going to wait 20 minutes she refuse to make another pizza .I asked for my money back and she rolled her eyes at me  Manager came to the front and was ok with them making another pizza .I think they need to treat costumers with respect .< /review>

To top it alllll off my pizza had no sodium on it whatsoever like did they not use the garlic butter!!!! I seen it on the cardboard box but not on my pizza!! Then I ask some other  lady, who was making pizza, answering calls and training another guy to take orders for parmesan and she said they 1dollar!!!!!!!!!! 🤯😡👎🏾 that like paying for ketchup and salt on French fries!!!! Never really wanted my money back from Domino's til today. Not sorry!!!< /Text>

<review>I like it.  Not sure what everyone's issue is, but people are more likely to complain than to write a good review.  I go here all the time.  I have had no issues.  it's domino's.  Taste the same as any other domino's.  It's quick, easy and yummy.  For all the haters, take a step back and breath.  It's pizza.  Dough, marinara, cheese and toppings.  If you get a pan pizze it will have a bit more oil as it bakes in the pan and needs to come out of the pan.  Just order a different style of pizza if you don't like the pan style pizza.  So many malcontents.<//review>< Date>

The food was disgusting -- saying too much oil would be an understatement. it's like it was made yesterday morning and was reheated -- I'm not saying it is actually made the day before, I'm just saying that was the effect of whatever issues they have on their food.

But you gotta be fair, they get things right more than not. It's just that sometimes it's too disgusting to give even two stars. I agree with the previous reviewer, with a $30 pizza there should be some kind of real quality control.< /text>

<Text>ordered online at 6:31, tracker said my order was out at 6:41, its 7:50 now and still no call or pizza, so i called the store the rep said the driver called numerous times yet i've been standing outside waiting since 7:10 with my phone in my hand. Instead of some customer service i get called a liar and and won't see a refund. We'll see.< /Text>< time>

Delivery service is horrible, I cannot believe the manger of this Dominos allows it. We placed an order and the worker on the phone asked for all of our information, including our address. The worker did not meantion that the address was out of their delivery zone and placed our order. She took our credit card information and charged it. The order said it would take 30-45 mintues. An hour later and the pizza is not delivered, so I call back. Only to find out that our address is out of the delivery zone and Dominos had canceled our order. I do not understand why I did not recieve a call from the emplloyee that had taken my order, to inform me that she was mistaken and that our address was out of zone. I then had to call another Dominos and place another order which then I would have to wait another 30 mintues for my pizza.< /Review>

I have had to wait extended periods of time in the recent past. I have not had to wait the last 2 times. The staff seem to care about any inconvenience.<//Text>

Call this place basically twice a week. Called few days ago and my pizza that came was not thin crust like i asked, don't know how that happens. and the philly had almost NO philly steak at all, like literally nothing. I called they said they would put a credit on my account, called today since its football to get my credit, they wouldn't do it, said there was no credit. Thats BAD BUSINESS. Just saying, lost my business< /Text>

We call to change our order and they still sending the old order , but didn't   deliver the new order so we Effen waited for more than one hour for nothing call back , to check on the order and they say it was cancelled , it seems they couldn't understand English  or Spanish,
Wtf is not rocket science to  change an order  , we  will never buy from this  or  other Dominoes again!!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) After 10:30 PM it is no longer possible to deliver a pizza 5min to marina. Not even in their parking lot (take away), because it is very dangerous which is completely wrong. (Statement from the manager)

I tried many Mountain Mikes Locations but I found out that this is the best location for pizza. I ordered pizza twice n it was ready on time. Above all, the topping of pizza was perfect. Otherwise, I always gets pizza with no to less toppings when order from different locations. I am very happy n satisfied with the service and quality of this Mountain Mikes.<//review>

I go for the pizza buffet.  Unfortunately, the place isn't busy enough on a weekday lunchtime so they don't keep the pizzas coming fast enough for my taste.  But when they do come out, they're good - you just have to ask them and they'll put something out</review>

Pizza is ok. Only two other people there when we got there, both waiting on carryout. I ordered three mini pizzas. They took FOREVER. About 15 minutes in my husband noticed that the receipt only had two pizzas in it. I asked the guy at the counter and he YELLED at me that I only ordered two pizzas and was put out that he has to put another pizza in. The store was nice and clean but I don't think we will be back.</review>

UPDATED review:  lowered to 2 stars.

I've been here a few times now, 3 times eat in and once take out.  The take out was the only positive experience I've had.

The pros - they did a good job in remodeling this space, and it has potential to be good.  The pizza itself (veggiemore in particular) is quite good and probably worth their premium price.

The downside -this restaurant seems very poorly managed.  The lunch buffet appears a good deal, but they've stopped including drinks.  They also make you re-use your plates if you go back up to the buffet - I'm pretty sure this is a health code violation.

They also don't have very much pizza on the buffet.  Today when I went in, they had half a pizza left for my party of three, and I pointed that out to them, and they said they make more as the pizza runs out.  We were there for 30 minutes and they never restocked the pizza.  So we basically paid $30 for half a medium pizza - not a very good value.

Finally, the cleanliness of this place leaves much to be desired - they don't seem to bus their tables often, nor do they wipe the tables well.

If you do give them a chance, I'd suggest carry out - the in restaurant experience is very disappointing for a place that had potential.</Text>

<Review>Interior is nice.There is a strange smell other than pizza. It doesnt smell like pizza when you walk in. Salad Bar didnt look appealing lettuce looked like its been sitting for a bit. Waited 45 minutes for a pizza in which when I walked in I was the only customer ordering. Had to go up to counter to inquire in which they brought it out in a box. I wanted to dine in. Pizza kinda cold. Absolutely no customer service here.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808fbf9dda432911:0xa362673f471250bd< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

It was the 4th game of the Warriors and the Cavaliers when we ordered pizza for dine in.  The cashier said about 25-30 minutes when I asked her of how long is the wait. Thirty five minutes passed - no pizza.  I went to the  counter and asked how much more of a wait, she checked and then said 10 more minutes. Over an hour passed still no pizza. I finally decided to just get my money back and forget about the pizza. The cashier decided to check the to go pizzas counter for customers that pre ordered.  There it is my pizza sitting there for I don’t know how long. This will be my last time going to this place.</Text>

The girl was rude taking my order over the phone and when i went to pick up they were extremely unprofessional. I had a coupon which the girl didnt know how to apply so she tried charging 12 dollars more, salad bar ingredients looked old and the girl making the pizza had long nails and no gloves.

1 hour, 15 minutes for a cold mediocre pizza. Paid for extra pepperoni. Apparently that means you get one extra pepperoni slice! Never again!<//review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>I was disappointed with this visit. My husband got me tacos and an iced coffee. The tacos were cold and the shell was almost rubbery. The iced coffee is normally good. Today it was like drinking straight creamer. It was so sweet I couldn’t drink it. Normally this location is good but the last few times I have come here I have been disappointed. Will most likely start going somewhere else.</text>< Pictures>

I normally love jack in the box, but this time my order was inedible. I ordered two tacos and they were so greasy and soggy that they fell apart when I opened them.<//Text>

<Text>I really didn't want to go into details, because I have decided NEVER to go again. My sister and I walked in to order to go.  Big mistake. We watched ad the person who took my order and money went back to prepare our food without washing his hands touching our tacos (cold, hard) my sister kept me from saying anything. I could not eat my food. Will not go back. Maybe no more fast food.<//Text><gmapID>0x80d955c68ed53ee5:0xb24e5bc046e8085e< /gmapID>< Resp>

< Review>
This Jack in the Box on mission gorge is terrible. I advise not to go there. I ordered two jumbo jacks and two fries and one drink. Waited in line an extremely long time. They gave me only one order of fries and one jumbo jack. I had to go back and ask for my food that I paid for. Terrible service. This is a big inconvenience when your order is not given to you. They had a bad attitude. No manners apology. They need better training.< /Review>

This place doesn't care for the well being of its customers. The cashier the same person who handles cash is the same person serving fries, drinks and opening paper bags. Ofcourse she has gloves she's protected but what about customers ? We're in the middle of a pandemic where is the common sense.<//Review>

What can I say, the tacos are addictive. I don't understand why they are so addictive,  but they are.    Most of the rest of the menu is so so. However, they also have really good fries.</Text>

It's a bit above average. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I  could. They have one of the better variety of items compared to most fast food and they usually have OK deals going on. It won't blow you away but it's solid for what it is.</Text>

<review>This is the worst jack in the box I have ever been to. I have visted this location on multiple occasions over the past 2.5 years and I don’t recall ever having a positive experience. The workers are very rude and very lazy. My orders are almost always incorrect and the food is always cold, never fresh. I will no longer be visiting this location.
(Also the workers are not wearing masks during the COVID mandatory mask order!)< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I go here a lot, my wife is obsessed with the tacos (so am I). I usually go late at night, and there is a gentleman who is usually there who goes above and beyond, great dude. However, sometimes there are some women there who have pretty crumby attitudes (they might've been having a bad day, I don't know, but that shouldn't affect your work ethic), and neglect the most simple requests. She asked if I wanted sauce, i replied "ranch and taco sauce, please", she then scoffed and didn't put any in (i didn't realize there were no sauces until i got home). Either way, it's jack in the box, so it's whatever. Good luck reading all that 😅< /text>

I would suggest these for breakfast biscuit with sausage would be a Chick-fil-A number 1 number two Carl's jr. Number three Jack in the Box breakfast burrito as I remember was good. This review that I gave McDonald's a little while back was because $8 for the freaking breakfast breeder piss me off it was just like this they had how many years to figure this out and when it still tastes like not the best thing in the world but I can eat anything but I'm still kind of disappointed cuz because I've been going to them for freaking over 40 years they have had plenty of time to Perfect food,.<//review>< Pictures>

If all fails go to this "JACK IN THE BOX". Day or Nite "drive thru is open 24 hours". It is in the Golden Hills area of San Diego, 24th & Market. The employees have been  always respectful & courteous.< /review>

I like their chicken teriyaki bowl and it comes with 1 egg roll. Now if you've never had an egg roll from JitB, well its impressive. They cook them from order so they're never sitting underneath a heatlamp and usually too hot to bite into right away. Today we had to pull off to the side and wait just a little bit because for or order. Wooorth it.<//review>

For some reason I always hit a traffic jam whenever I use the drive thru. Doesn't matter the time. Don't expect a quick drive thru experience like chick fil a or even taco bell in the area. It's really easy to get to and from the 15 freeway so I guess that's what makes it popular.</Text>

I love Jack in the Box as the go to late night food but this place has messed up my order at least 3-4 times. Once I ordered a burger with no meat at all and ended up with a burger that had bacon. The service itself is usually nice but sometimes the order can get messed up but they do help fix the order any way they can.</text>

The prices went up a bit but when you need a quick meal for less than five bucks they're the way to go.< /Text>

<Review>Slow drive thru. Finally got to window. Drove away and had somebody elses order. Went back inside and they remade the order. Something that was supposed to be quick and convenient became a delay and inconvenient. Food was good though once I got the right thing.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80d955c68ed53ee5:0xb24e5bc046e8085e</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>I have been coming to this Jack in the Box for the last 5 years or so and all of the staff are pleasant and hard working.  What is Marcela, Pancho, Nicole and the Manager Norma...they're great people...the problem there is that there is such great turnover of employees that at times it undermines the effort that they do to make the Customer happy....maybe because the owner of the Jack in the Box doesnt provide good benefits and so anyone that has potential to make that particular JIB a steller performing store. ...but i guess no one really cares about the employees.....so people leave....</Text>< userid>

Jack is usually my pick among local fast food. This one declined to honor a BOGO e-coupon I received on my smartphone from corporate Jack, saying I'd have to print it out. On National Cheeseburger Day, seems pretty lame.<//Text>

Either the owner, district manager, or corporate manager needs to make a visit during the late shift to witness how  unwelcoming and horrible the service is here.  Each time i have visited this location during the late shift I have experienced horrible service. I went through the 24-hour drive thru and had to wait nearly 5 minutes before someone finally took my order. The lady that took my order clearly had an attitude and if anyone should have an attitude that night it should have been me! For having to wait so long before I could get my order taken. Then when I get to the window I had to repeat my order because she had gotten my order wrong and all I asked for was an Ultimate Cheeseburger on sourdough bread with only EZ mustard. No fries or a drink. How complicated is that?? On top of that, some fat Asian kid at the window ALSO had an attitude! Here's a word of advice: If you don't like your job QUIT AND FIND ANOTHER ONE. Let's get it together Jack in the Crack!</Text>

<Text>I ordered a 4 piece chicken strip for $5.19 and they were the size of my 12 year old son pinky finger.  Not Good!  And to add insult to injury, I went imto the mens restroom and the air dryer to dry your hamds didn't work and they didn't have any paper towels.  The bathroom stinks as well.  I shared this with an employee at the cash register and he looked at me as if I had dog poop on my face.   So my son and I walked away and will never ever go back to a Jack In The Box!</Text>< pictures>
