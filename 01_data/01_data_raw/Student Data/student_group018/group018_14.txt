<text>Place is not clean. Attended a Professional water therapy class and the facility wouldn't even let us enter the place until 4 P.m. . It ate into our hour of therapy, because you had to get changed, Etc. Pool was barely warm because of a maintenance issue. The pool is dirty and has floating things in it like hair, etc.  Better of at Los Alamitos if you need water therapy.< /text>< Pics>

This is a great pool option for you. They keep the pool very warm which is great for arthritis. If you have a disability you can use these pools easily as they are specially designed for you to be able to access the pool. They have water aerobics and physical therapy and it's really a nice crowd that goes there. The administrative staff is very nice and helpful. It's $325 per year but you can go all you want</text>

Best pool ever! If you're hurt or have an injury you should definitely go there, and if your not you  should still go. Warm water workouts are amazing!! When will other pools learn this??< /review>

Really amazing place helps your body feel good. The therapist care about your pain. They never over exert your body to the point of pain. This place is absolutely amazing. I cannot wait to go back one day again really soon.< /text>

<Text>Love the warm water! It's really nice that the supply so many different kinds of safety vest, supports, noodles, weights, paddle boards just anything to keep you comfortable, safe & relaxed while your in the water.

The life guards are nice as well as the water therapist. The staff are very positive, encouraging and focus to help you no matter what your going through!

Pools of Hope isn't just for people with disabilities, it's for everyone! The young, old, doesn't matter what your skin tone is.

They also have to pools, a lap pool and a large general pool! They have lifts for both oools. They only thing I feel it needs is a larger ladies dressing room and another shower. They currently have two.

Over all it's a great pool and staff!</Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I am surviving Multiple Sclerosis, and although many people with MS are heat sensitive, as am I, the warm waters are doing wonders for me.  My Therapist has given me exercises, that awaken muscles that I haven't felt work in years. I believe that with the warm water and the therapy, my mobility is improving.  I thank God for the California Aquatic Therapy Center/California Pools of Hope.<//Review>

< Review>
I will update my review once I am finished with my toddler's swimming lessons..

Edit: I wasn't necessarily satisfied with the swimming instructor. The director/manager of the pool gave my daughter one lesson when the instructor was absent and it was the best one she had through the course. I forgot her name, but she was very kind and helped my toddler let go in the water. I am very thankful and appreciate that specific person and her teaching skills. As of now, I'll be returning next year spring summer for another set of lessons.</Review>

I was told a million different stories about deposit money, remaining balance etc. and then was yelled at by the director about me asking for a cleaning deposit that I was told I was getting back on the next business day by one her own staff.

Pool of HOPE is a God - send ! I've been attending the cardiac water aerobics and it is amazing. I had been off for 3-1/2 months, walking with a walker. Not anymore!!! Im even back to work.  The water exercises are really helping me reach my goals. The instructor  Christine is amazing!!!! I will take the class another 6 weeks and then join for the annual membership!!! I love it. Family environment! I even put my daughter in the swim camp!!!!< /Review>

Pools of Despair.  I don’t know if they’re seriously understaffed, bad at their jobs, or both.  I’m giving up, will settle for regular physical therapy, because this is way too complicated.  There’s a special place in hell for Xiomara (sp?)<//Review>

I was really excited to visit this place and when I check the hours it said it was open but when I arrived the door was locked and there was no explanation of why it was closed. I would recommend calling and speaking to someone first before taking the long drive up there< /Text>

<Review>Nice people, interesting things to see. This is not a professionally curated museum, though. Most objects have no dates, no explanation, and they are crowded together with no criteria. Most attention seems to focus on important and wealthy or respectable families with little reference to the life of regular people. Almost nothing about miners.</Review>< username>

Really cool to see some of the old stuff. It's not a sterile museum like so many, do you can actually see and smell the history. Friendly staff and cheap admission.</Review>

< Review>
So our second stop was at the Julian Pioneer Museum. This place is run by volunteers and there is a $3 donation fee, not bad at all. There is no actual parking in this property but there is street parking, if you are lucky enough to find any that is lol.
This is quite a small place but it is filled with a lot of old information from this town. From the original pioneers, many old artifacts, how they cooked, the kind of clothes they wore. What was surprising is that they actually have a lot of things that are not closed up in display cases. Mostly everything here has a sign for you not to touch anything, which is understandable all this stuff is really old. There is a table in the front that they will let you touch though lol it's of dead animals fur and snake skin lol.
It's was very informative and interesting for a very small place< /Review>

Great place. Very nice staff. Everyone who says they take a long time to load...it's because you don't have a scheduled appointment. If you make n appointment your order will be ready by the time you get there. So next time make a damn appointment, it's not that hard 😒😑 shesh...<//text>

If there ain't many trucks it's  a quick unload,  if a line of trucks, you're in there for some time.</text>

<Review>Worst place ever. Arrived at 1pm for a 4pm load of 6 pallets. Didn't get on the dock till 530pm. They didn't start loading till 7pm. Some other trucks came in loaded and gone in 20 min. Staff is ride and incompetent. Ran me out of hours with no overnight parking. I have 4 other pickups to do and have to deliver in Oregon in 2 days. I will never accept a load from here again.</Review><name>Deborah Allen<//name><Response>None< /Response></record>

Here I went to a reception after attending a funeral,with the family. This church they tell me was brought to this site in two pieces and later put in place where it now sits. Lots of parking and ground it layed out to accommodate large groups of people.< /Review>

<Review>Jesus died for all our sins.  Know Him personally? By faith and not by site.  He is good.  When asked who He was He said I am. Was He a liar? No.  Just God in flesh.  Only one who could save us.  Just got to check Him out.  I need Him.  Places like this guide you and neat to be amongst others who love Him to and want to know more.  All I can say.  Is a good thing for your week and your eternal soul.  Wanna see Him on good terms? Hahaha.  Just logical.  But it's more than just being good we can't always be.  Find out why.  I got this at 17. 40 years later still amazing!<//Review>< Pics>

this was my first time at rose gold's and this will not be my last! they have the most beautiful selection of gold jewelry, diamonds and gems. pretty pricey pieces but fine jewelry is an investment and i definitely got what i paid for. both of the ladies working were kind and inviting. i plan on come backing in the future to change my current jewelry once i have enough checks saved lol. 10/10 experience!!<//review>

Super friendly and warm. More expensive than other places because they use gold in their piercings. They take pictures of all their clients. I give 5 stars for the attitude, attention, cleanliness, & the fact that my tragus piercing never had one infection, and healed up perfectly. 😀<//text>

Chris did amazing work on me about 2 weeks ago. Healing beautifully. So perfectly done! I felt super comfortable with him. He is very relaxed and professional. Can't wait to get another tattoo done by him! Thanks for your talent Chris! (He did the Arabic writing, not the owl)< /text>

SUCH a great piercing studio! They have absolutely beautiful jewelry (a little too easy to spend a bit too much $$$) and the staff and piercers are super friendly and knowledgeable.

I got a daith, flat, and upper lobe piercing and Perry gave me confidence that they would look awesome together in my ear, and they absolutely do!

I can’t wait to go back to get more piercings!</Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Perry pierced my daughter’s ears a few weeks ago. She was nervous and has put off getting them done for a few years, but was determined to do it that weekend. We had plenty of time and support picking out her jewelry, and Perry really gave her control of the situation, and spent time explaining everything in detail to make her comfortable. He gave her a simple and effective routine to care for her piercing. My review doesn’t do this service justice, it was truly exceptional and we felt so taken care of.</Review>< Name>

A spectacular shop full of talented artists and piercers!

Ben did a wonderful job on a small, hand-written word on my right wrist/forearm, and I can't say enough about Perry's warmth and professionalism. He helped me rehab a *terrible* daith (that piercer had lied to me about their level of experience and the quality of their jewelry, but that's another story), and he was eventually able to re-pierce it properly with a gorgeous gold ring. He also did my nostril piercing, and both are now healing beautifully. Mel at the counter is absolutely delightful and will always make an effort to see you promptly even during the shop's (often) hectic days.

Rose Gold's is my go-to shop in SF, and I can't recommend them highly enough!

(Sorry for the subpar photos, I'm camera angle-inept, but I tried.)<//Review>

Perry is the best piercer I’ve ever met. I’ve done multiple piercings with him, from a conch to a nostril piercing and they’ve all turned out wonderful. Listen to your piercer for after care, and be strict about it if you want it to turn out well.
(Not all piercings in the photo are done here, but the conch, double upper lobes are.)</Text>

Had the best experience from entering, talking with the staff, choosing my jewelry, to the piercing itself. I got a septum piercing by Alana. I live around 2 hours away and had been holding off to go here and I cannot wait until the next time I can go back.< /Review>

I love rose gold!! The quality is top notch and Perry, the resident piercer, is so sweet and incredibly skilled. I've gone here to get all my piercings done while living in the bay Area and I wouldn't go elsewhere. It is a little pricey but all their jewelry is extremely high quality and you're paying for perfection.< /review>

<username>Katie Morris< /username><Review>Best experience I've had in a shop. VERY clean, and super friendly staff. Perry removed my surface anchors for me. Took him not even 30 seconds for each. I was so nervous, and he reassured me there was no reason to be. He walked me through the process, and didn't surprise me anything. It was quick, painless, and a pleasant experience! The lady at the front was so kind, and I loved chatting with her!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND :) great jewelry selection!</Review><Gmap_id>0x808580acc260760f:0x10006351c4d29776<//Gmap_id><rating>5</rating>< Resp>

Great staff. I had a great experience getting both of my ear lobes pierced. Alana was very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. The earrings were $100 each (prices vary) and there is a 20% discount ($180) with the piercing ($25) and saline spray ($10) it cost about $215 before tax. The shorter posts you will need a month later cost $27 (titanium). It only takes a few mins to have them change the posts for you.</Review>

Everyone in here is incredible from beginning to end. They have a beautiful jewelry selection - though this place is popular, you may need to order something if they're out of it that weekend. Perry is so sweet and patient, and will make sure you leave feeling beautiful and proud of your new piercing.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I've been to the shop twice. I spent too much time asking questions and drooling over the sick jewelry selection. Still, Perry and Melissa made me feel welcome, answered all my questions and helped me make the right selection for my body.  When a piercer suggests you don't get a piercing you want very badly because you don't have the anatomy for it, and also provides alternative suggestions for what WILL work for you, they prove their professionalism and integrity. I walked away with two piercings that were painless, perfectly placed and strikingly beautiful.  Thank you Perry (the best of the best) and Melissa (savvy and sweet!). I have plans to collaborate on more pretties from you guys!</Review>< pics>

First off nothing but love for these people at Rose Gold's. Not only have all the staff been informative and respectful, but they really care about you when you spend the time under the needle with them... whether it's a tattoo or a piercing they spend the time getting to know you and listening. I will not go anywhere else for my tattoos or piercings. Much love and appreciation to all you're at people at RG.. Perry, Alana, Mike, AJ, Melissa and.....Ruben even though you have not worked on us at all man you have been there quietly supporting us as well!!! Until next time all!!!</Review>

<text>Best experience ever! I had a problem with an old nose piercing. It needed to be redone, but I was looking for a place with an experienced, well-trained staff, and someone who was compassionate about my fear of pain & scarring.

Another shop said they couldn't help me, but thanks to their honesty, referred me to Rose Gold, instead.

With great apprehension, I called Rgold. A very informative man named Perry answered all my many, many questions, and convinced me to come to the shop just for an evaluation.

Long story short...It was Perry's patience,  kindness and extensive knowledge about skin piercing that convinced me to have my nose redone. Perry was great--quick, reassuring and painless!</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Amazing piercing and staff. Pricing not clear and pretty dang expensive. I got a simple silver ball and it was $100 and they didn't even tell me to check and see if I was okay paying that much for an earring. Yes, ONE earring was $100. I'm impressed by everything and everyone there. The three stars is for pricing and confusion alone.</Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1503169154005, 'text': "Hey Sara,\nSorry for the confusion. Usually people who are concerned about budget will ask the price beforehand and we did write the price at the bottom of your paperwork that you filled out prior to being pierced or charged.\nThe ball that you got was not silver, we don't carry silver or very much titanium or steel- it is actually solid 18k white gold. The ball itself was only $55+ tax, the piercing fee was $30 and your aftercare spray was $10.\nThanks so much for your review.\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.\n\nKind Regards,\nMelissa"}</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>I've had great advice and help on healing an existing piercing, and have been pierced at Rose Gold. I'm so impressed with the knowledge of the staff, the selection of quality jewelry, and the insane patience of Christopher (the piercer). Chris was patient when I nearly fainted and has a gentle, steady hand. I drove an hour and 40 mins just to be pierced by him..and I would totally do it again.< /review>< Pictures>

<date>1517324917235<//date><rate>5<//rate><Review>After having poured through different photos for a few weeks, I came in here with a few ideas of piercings I wanted, but was uncertain which were actually possible with the shape of my ear. Perry was able to quickly take a look at my ear and rule some out, and suggest others which could work better for me.

I decided to go with a forward helix piercing, but when it came time to pick jewelry, I fell in love with an oval piece that wouldn't work for the piercing I had in mind. Perry took a look at it and said "this would be perfect in a conch piercing" and held it up for me to see. I loved the way it looked, but I hadn't gotten a piercing in 10 years and was worried about the pain and healing (conches seem painful to me, idk why). He assured me it was an easy piercing and healing process so I decided to do it. He was absolutely right. He did the piercing in a split second, and it was the least painful piercing I've ever had. The first thing I said was "woah you're really good!" and the second was "I've had flu shots more painful than that". 10/10 would recommend coming here for a piercing.

The thing I love most is the placement. The jewelry faces forward and is always visible, but looks great from the side too. It catches the light and really adds some character. Can't wait to come back and get some piercings on the other ear!

A note on pricing: all of the jewelry they sell is fine metals, diamonds, and semi precious stones. For the simplest plain ball, you're looking at 60ish dollars, but for anything else, it seemed like the pricepoint was between $100-200 and much more for the really bling-y pieces (there was one in there I adored that was $550). They have simple diamond studs, but they don't pierce with the smallest size, so you need to buy at least the medium size, which was ~$130 (the large was $150 I think). I'm in the phase of my life were I want nice things that'll last, so I thought it was worth it, but definitely be willing to shell out if you come here to be pierced.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhhrRlI38I8_4wTZHJikZek4-TLa2_B34iS9PV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

I went to another piercer yesterday, 4 months after Ive been to rose gold sf, who told me that the golden piercing is not only unsuitable for the beginning but also it was not worth more than 50 Dollars...! Besides, she shot the piercing way too wide inside. Pity, Im not American and can tell them face to face. Absolutely not recommendable!!!
The guy who owns the shop though, Perry, is fantastic. just make sure you avoid the female piercer...< /review><name>janine a.</name></record></dataset><record>

<text>(Translated by Google) The first thing you will find when you travel to Europe is the winery
And the plaque market. America has a shopping mall and a vintage shop
Find. This place is just a hole-in-the-
There are many old things and vintage shops.
There is a place that seems to have worn in the West in the sixties
Clothes and accessories, accessories, LP plates, pubs, etc.
It is filling. A good thing to do is to bargain
And those who are sensitive or allergic to odor,
You should avoid the lichen shop. Old clothes
I was struck by the old smell of 2,30 years old in Changan.
I might cry ^^

유럽여행할 때 가장 먼저 찾아놓는 것이 와이너리
와 플리마켓이다.  미국은 쇼핑몰과 빈티지샵을
찾는다.  이곳은 그저 구경만으로도 핫한 거리이
고 옛 물건이나 빈티지샵등 집시풍이 물씬 풍기
는 곳도 있고 60년대 미서부에서 입었을 듯한
옷과 장신구, 액세서리, LP판, 펍 등이 거리를
메우고 있다.  주의사항은 흥정을 잘 해보는 것
과 냄새에 민감하거나 알러지 있는 분들은 빈티
지의류 샵은 피하는게 좋다. 예전 그대로의 옷이
있는데 장농에서 2,30년된 묵은 냄새에 어지러
울 수도 있다^^<//text>< Rating>

Been in and tattooed me twice, got fast and good service and top results both times !! Fantastic service-minded staff who do everything to make the customer feel prioritized. Would really recommend this tattoo studio to anyone who wants to get a new tattoo and is in the area! Will definitely go back next time I'm in town and want to get a new tattoo! If you want to do something bigger, it is recommended that you book time before and if you want to do something smaller, you can go in and see if they have time to do the same day.

Varmt välkomnande och härlig atmosfär! Vart inne och tatuerat mig två gånger, fått snabb och bra service och toppen resultat båda gångerna!! Fantastiskt service-minded personal som gör allt för att kunden ska känna sig prioriterad. Skulle verkligen varmt rekommendera denna tatueringsstudio för den som vill skaffa en ny tatuering och är i området! Kommer definitivt gå tillbaka nästa gång jag är i stan och vill skaffa en ny tatuering! Vill man göra något större rekommenderas det att man bokat tid innan och vill man göra något mindre kan man gå in och se om de har tid att göra den samma dag.</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808580acc260760f:0x10006351c4d29776<//Gmap_id></record>

I was ripped off by other phone repair places in the past. I needed to get a galaxy s8 and note 8 screens repaired, and luckily, Cellairis was the only place I found that has the BEST prices for repairing phone screens for a decent and fair price. I am so grateful and glad I found Cellairis. The customer service was phenomenal and they have amazing screen covers and screen protectors for a fair price as well. You will NOT regret coming here for the repairs you need for your phone. I will never go anywhere else again. I would give 10 STARS if I could, I am very thankful for the honest and sincere customer service I recieved from Cellairis. Thank you!! 🙏🏾💜🥰</review>

I dropped my phone off to fix broken screen at 11:30 and an hour later it was done. I think my screen is better now than it was when I bought the phone. Great job guys. Would recommend the ontario mills location 150%.<//Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1604099325097, 'text': 'Thank you Jules for your detailed review. Very much appreciated!!!'}<//Resp><Text>This place is honest & fair, I was shopping in the mall & needed cleaning for my cell phone due to it not charging correctly, they cleaned it with no charge while helping another customer. I felt unethical to not leave something for his effort.

I had given him a tip for his compassion, he had told me I needle a battery for my phone, I brought it back the next day, he installed a new battery & made other adjustments for a very fair price. Had I gone to Apple or my provider. They would have tried to sell me a new phone for $1000 + dollars. I'm happy with the price, work, and attention. I highly recommend cellairis before going to others in the mall who may deceive you.</Text></record>

The customer service here was amazing, the workers were so kind and approachable and they communicated the pricing and everything to take into consideration in fixing my phone. Aaron worked on my phone and had a new screen on my iPhone within 20 minutes. He also fixed all of the loose screws inside as well. They did it for cheaper than any other places I’ve checked out as well. Over all great service and pricing.< /text>

<Review>My mother and I were at the mall shopping when we came across Cellairis. Aaron, our phone tech, was very personable and welcoming. He gave a warming vibe that made us want to inquire about screen repairs. Upon asking about pricing, he made sure he could accommodate us as much as possible. He made great conversation with us. He also gave insight on other ways to help me with my phone without being overbearing about getting me to fix it with them. Before adding the finishing touches on my mothers phone, he made sure the functions worked before we made that final purchase. I loved his customer service skills. I would definitely go back as well as would recommend to others.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5<//rating>< Resp>

while everyone in the mall said that I have to replace the battery and I have to take the risk of cracking the screen at my own cost. Nabin was able to debug the issue without just telling me to replace the battery without even thinking. Nice guy and happy to answer questions</text>

Bought some cell phone covers and a screen protector with a lifetime warranty.  A month later I dropped my phone and the screen protector cracked. I drove a significant distance to get a replacement. It's a usual 10$ fee to change the screen protector but since I had a long drive they waived the fee. Thanks nabin for great customer service and great quality items.< /Review>

After I fixed my 7 plus at another store, the home button stopped working. I took it back and they said I had damaged it and will not warranty it. I took it to a few other places and they said only apple can fix it. I was just passing by the mall and saw this place. Asked the guy if they can fix my home button. He said he could fix the home button but touch id will not work. I was fine with it. I am so happy it is working now. Great service, great price. Will definitely recommend!!!< /Text>

Working with Aaron was easy, great attitude, and very helpful/informative with taking care and advising on how to maintain the phone properly. Will come here again if any of the other phones go out. Great prices as well.

Cracked my phone and my screen was non functional. Every electronic repair shop was closed except for Cellairis. They fixed my screen with an oled panel quite quickly and even fixed my sister’s cracked camera. They are helpful and efficient when it comes to fixing cracked screens on iPhones. Recommend them to anyone who accidentally breaks their screen and needs a quick fix.<//review>

<Review>From the owner: Located inside Ontario mills mall yet cheaper than outside. Best quality parts with a lifetime warranty. Top notch customer service. No device is turned away, we fix everything. Most phones’ parts in stock including iphone, samsung, lg, motorola, pixel, zte, one plus, etc. We’ve god rad cases too!!! Walk ins welcome. Very short wait on most repairs.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Some either pop off or crack very easy. Anju suggested that because of the edge screen the glass protectors don’t adhere very well and she recommended a plastic one. I decided to give it a try. She installed it very well without any bubbles which is liked it very much. It’s been a few days and it’s holding very well. I hope this will be an end to my screen protector replacements.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Cellairis always comes to my resue. Third time getting my i6 screen fixed. This time was free coz i bought their case and screen protector when I came in for repair last time. My i6 frame is bent so I break the screen often.  The level of customer service has blown me away.
If you break your phone like I do, get their case and screen protector and they fix your phone for free every time and they dont charge you a dime.< /review>< pictures>

After 45 minutes all we ever received were the hot chocolates, chips, salsa, and bill. Where's the meatloaf? Waitress said she never heard the order. She never wrote it down. No spoon, no napkins, no check-up from server. Never tried the food, because it was never delivered. Next time our time and money will be spent elsewhere .</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My wife and I ate here after a bad experience at another restaurant. We loved it. Jenny our waitress greeted us as we walked up the stairs. She smiled the whole time we were there and that makes a big difference in how we felt about being there. My wife had the Mac and cheese and I had the fried chicken. The food was great, thanks to Carmen the owner and cook. We will definitely come back here.<//text>

Anyone who knows Carmen knows she has a heart full of love, a head full of knowledge, and a menu that makes you drool. She's downhome and customer oriented. She has the most fun at work when she sees her patrons having fun. She bends over backwards for her employees and her community. Did I mention her dedication to the hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail? They call her a trail angel...I just say angel. A true star!< /text>

<text>READ PAST REVIEWS ON HERE AND YELP. DON'T COME HERE! We arrived and the waitress/owner took 15 min to greet us and another 15 min to bring chips and salsa.  Over an hour later we finally got our kids food, but nothing for us. While this was going on several customers saw that we were not happy about not getting our food and got up and left.  Finally not wanting to wait any more I walked inside and told the waitress/owner we were leaving.  She immediately got defensive and raised her voice at me saying "I don't need this s__t".  I'm just happy that we were able to save a couple families from attempting to eat at this terrible restaurant. DON'T EVER COME HERE!!!!!!!!!  My first mistake was not reading reviews before coming here because surprise surprise they have a history of poor and slow service. Oh yes and to top it off, I watched the owner/waitress grab a rag off the top of a garbage can to clean off a new customers table!  For that I will report them to the CA dept of health<//text><time>1464404884930< /time><rate>1<//rate><username>Kurt Clark<//username></record></dataset><record>

First, I must say that this was a repeat visit based on the fact that the first time we went there for dinner, the waitress (I think it was the owner) was so personable and attentive, and the dinner was delicious! It was quiet and romantic. We expected at least some semblance of the same. This time, the place was packed. We couldn't get anyone's attention for menus, so went up to the cash register and was told to sit anywhere. We had a hard time finding a place to sit away from the blaring boom box. What's up with that?  45 minutes went by. Finally a teen boy came and asked us we wanted something to drink. We got our own menus and picked out something easy to order and bring. I ordered a hamburger. It was brought to me almost raw. Isn't there a law against that? I could go on and on about the very young waitress. She was really curt and rude. I think she was tasked with handling everything and she was stressed. But I didn't think she had to be so rude to me. There are a lot of really nice places to eat in Julian. I can check this one off as--been there--won't go back.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Horrible place to stop by and get food. Don't spend your money here unless you want to get bad service and nasty food. When I found a bug in my food I was, okay a mistake but then when I notice my glass dirty and the salt shaker having little black particles that wasn't pepper I was just done. To top it off the waitress didn't care was rude and unapologetic..<//text>

Went on a very busy day. Was greeted by hostess with “sit wherever, I’ll get there when I can.” The food came before our beverages, we got the wrong bill, there was a metal twist tie in my husband’s meal. Alerted staff of the wrong bill they gave us a different bill and overcharged, we didn’t notice at the time because we just wanted to get out. $90 for three people? We will never go there again.<//Review>

I wish there was an option to not even give it a star. The food was so so however the service at this joint made it difficult to even enjoy the over priced grub. I think if I hadn't asked for anything they would have let me sit there all afternoon. It was almost like the employees were annoyed that they had to serve people. Save your time and money and skip carmens place.< /Text>

Their setup is very confusing. Nobody knew if they were supposed to order first then sit or find their own table. Food was just okay. Service was slow and inattentive. Server didn't even know she didn't bring one of our entrees until we told her, after she gave us our check.</Text>

I am shocked. This used to be the best store in greater Sacramento county. I live in fair oaks and drive to Folsom because of this. They have raised their prices, and they had to make my order from scratch, well that might be alright, but nobody there was friendly or smiling. Yes I can tell if you are smiling under the mask. In 15 yrs this was first time I felt they didn't care if I was there or not. They dont do special orders any more. This ( pandemic ) has hit another restaurant. It was a bad experience.< /review>

I usually love little caesars. But they need to fire some of their current employees.  Their lack of respect/interest in the customer is astonishing.  I waited 5 minutes before being acknowledged, to then be told that I would have to wait an additional 6 mins at least to get a hot n ready pepperoni pizza. So I left without receiving an apology. This used to NEVER happen.  Quality and reputation are the most important thing for a business. Once those things decrease... The business loses what made it what it was to begin with.< /review>

You can't beat this pizza for 5 bucks. The staff is pretty nice, and at the most you have to wait 10 minutes for a fresh pizza. Great place for a quick cheap dinner .</review>

<Review>We discovered the design your own pizza. Yum. Only missing ingredient is pineapple. LOL. Yes, Im one of THOSE people, I enjoy pineapple on my pizza!

We used to get the hot and ready - only cheese and pepperoni. For only a few dollars more you can design your own.
So worth it!! You must use the app on your cell to get this. Also, if you use the app, you can order a 2-liter soda, and with a code, there will be no charge for your soda. Bonus!

Only issue is, (and why I deducted two stars) the pizza is never the same two times on a row. One time its cooked to perfection,  but short on the toppings, next time, it's undercooked, or burned on the bottom, or even lukewarm when picked up. Once on a blue moon everything comes together and you get a delicious cooked pizza, including the toppings, steaming hot, with lots of toppings on a perfectly baked crust.  Yum!

If you havent tried Little Caesars Pizza, I suggest you give them a try! You might be surprised how much money you save.<//Review>< response>

Great service and friendly staff. Pizza gets a meh. But it's cheap and ready fast, so I suppose you get what you pay for. Definitely not the best pizza, but if you're looking for a cheap and easy dinner, you can do far worse.< /Text>

<Name>Daniel Flores</Name><user>100489365556523803691<//user><Text>Nice place to have a beer and watch the game a bit of an older crowd which is good if you're into that or not so good if you're not the food was decent it just took a little bit longer to serve than I prefer same goes for the beers I had to wait over 25 minutes to get a refill each time I finish my beer which was due to short staffing on a busy night but the customer service was good and the staff seem to be hustling the entire time so I can't fault them. They had a few local beers on tap along with a lot of mixed drink options.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Outdoor seating during Covid. Beautiful space to eat outside. So happy with my order. Chipotle chicken sandwich with skinny fries. Husband said the BBQ burger was great. The pretzels were soft 😋<//Review>

More of a bar than a restaurant. Even made a reservation, and they were not at all prepared for our party of five. Had no bacon available. The “club sandwich” was a plain deli turkey. Bait and switch on the coupons at the door. These were not applied to drinks ordered. Friendly staff was only redeeming quality.< /review>

Staff: very attentive with a good customer rapport. FOOD:had the steak very good quality, after being cooked you can tell it was rested (No ugly blood on plate) also had the charcuterie plate very well thought out presentation with a decent amount of cured meats, cheese was very good (hard+soft+no yellow cheese) DRINKS:  had a old fashion very well prepared with a rye Bourbon. Of course 805 on tap had a few. OVERALL: Go try this spot not only is it good with a nice decor you will actually see the owner mingling with the guests. Big part is your supporting a local business.</Text>< Pictures>

I like this spot! They give superb meals, their menu is large, The chief cook in that spot is very trained, I enjoy very much eating all their dishes. The food is always fresh and tasty, the service towards the clients  is good. I frequently visit this place and I not even once was unhappy. I recommend this place.</Review>

<Review>All the dishes we ordered were very tasty. The broccoli soup was the best, with wonderful fresh herbs. Husband enjoyed the scallops but was hungry enough to order the wings afterward (he is not a heavy eater).

My family was in town and we came to the restaurant just before the rush. The service was excellent. The food was delicious. My personal favorite was the brussel sprouts appetizer. The clam chowder was excellent also. The burgers were big and juicy and delicious. We met the owner as he came to check on how everything was. My dad used to own a restaurant and he was entirely impressed. We'll be back again for sure.</text>

I knew the bar tender food was amazing but over priced.. drinks were great.. definitely a different place then it was.. it gets a five for the food though. Won't go back because I can get the same quality at a more reasonable price elsewhere<//text>

Happy hour is not worth it! 🤧😭
Good burger, but besides that, nothing really outstanding. I think I'd rather go down the street to the Moquecan Brazilian restraunt, and their happy hour. Not much of a variety for dinner here.</Review>

Best pretzels you will have, dry seasoned wings, tasty chili (not sure if that's every night?), my buddy had a burger said that was good too.  They have space dust on tap 👌.  I came in to watch NBA all star and UFC and they have individual speakers for your table so you can hear the audio you want, this is nice I haven't seen this before.

<Review>OXNARD has a cool fun place you can gather with family and friends for a cold one.  Brand new The Shores is back!  Still a nice place to hang and with a great food menu too.  I do highly recommend you come out and enjoy the atmosphere here.  My new hangout place with lots to do and several Large screen TV's no bad seat in the house for your favorite sporting event.

<username>Dayna Crow< /username><Date>1566779326330< /Date><rating>4< /rating><text>First visit since reopening. Saturday noonish. Probably 8-10 people near the bar when we arrived, probably 18-20 at the bar and 7-8 tables of people when we left an hour later. Noon was a great time to arrive. It was quiet noise-wise at noon, very loud and hard to have a private conversation an hour later. Ordered a club sandwich with steak fries and blackened tacos ($13 each). The club sandwich was yummy and generous, although sloppily put together. The street taco-sized halibut tacos were each 3-4 bites of taco with an odd/weird taste and too much sweetness. The tacos were so small I shared 1/2 of my sweetie’s club sandwich and still felt hungry soon after we got home. Hmmm. The server was nice, and checked back, but had way too many tables to wait to return promptly as needed. Asked about dessert, but the choice was 2 kinds of white cake (strawberry or champagne). Nothing fruity, chocolate, or cold on a hot day. Might go back for the club sandwich, might try something else. But the lunch/brunch menu choices and prices didn’t wow us. Did like the big wall art. The sports bar environment was energetic and happy. (I forgot photos today.)</text>< Pictures>

Haven't been to the place since the new re-opening. It's all nice and grand. I'll miss the fish I'd see when I would first walk in. They have karaoke once a week(Thursday), food which I'll try later, and I don't know if they have live music. They also have one pool table and a shuffle board. I didn't get to play on those because I came on a karaoke night. The customers seemed nice and I bumped into people I knew. Bartenders seemed nice enough too. I didn't really get to talk with them. Next time I'll be prepared cuz I was nervous coming into the place.< /Text>

< review>
We are just getting to know Phoenix and are so happy to have discovered TEN. The atmosphere is perfect - cozy and casual, but feels a little special/indulgent. We were a group of 7 aged 19 to 51 years old and we all found something fantastic. Two pot roasts, 2 fish specials, a burger, a pulled pork, and a salad with chicken. All went home happy and content and we all want to go back soon - maybe even before we head back to the frozen tundra (Minnesota). Oh, and the cocktails were SO good. Loved this place. Can't wait to become a regular when visiting Phoenix.< /review>

Best dog park in Ventura Oxnard or Camarillo. Well maintained. There only problem I see is with the people who take their small dog into the big dog side and something happens and they blame the big dog. There is a reason they have 2 sections, one for big and one for small. If you keep to the proper side there are a lot less incidents.</text>

<review>Mopro has been very responsive to changes that I'd like done. The website is looking better and better as I make tweaks and add pictures of new projects. They have been good on the phone - with quick wait times. And good with online requests, always emailing to ensure you're happy with what they've done.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I Love my Mopro Team!!. I have been using the Mopro team as a partner for a few years now. They have consistently improved their processes and staff. One in particular a Richard S. This individual went over and above to quickly recognize our brand and make the necessary adjustment to get our site back up in a desirable state for our customers to quickly begin purchasing our products. That's what we call having someone you can rely on. Great work! Mopro!<//text>

If I did not have to recreate the entire website again from scratch with another company I would have switched from them a years ago.  I had them create a count down widget and install it on the website.  I told them at the time of creation that they are to save the widget because it will be used annually at the same time. That was 4 years ago and they had had to recreate the countdown widget every year DESPITE repeated instructions TO SAVE IT FOR USE AGAIN NEXT YEAR... Completely incompetent they can't even follow simple instructions!< /Text>< name>

I was cold called by a sales agent. When informing him I was not interested he was very pushy and keeps talking to prevent me from rudely hanging up. I felt like he had to make this sale or else. I signed up and was shown some great looking sites. My website did not turn out even close to the websites the sales person showed me. My site literally looks like a basic template. When I worked with the account manager to provide him with ideas on my site he said he would make sure it looked custom. Not happy with the quality of service.</review>

< review>
We’ve been a customer of Mopro for many years. During that time, we experienced some trying internal Mopro transitions along the way. That said, we always knew it would be best for us in the long run to stick it out and continue to keep Mopro on our “team”.

Today, things could not be better.

Throughout those years, we’ve worked with numerous outstanding Mopro personnel who have provided us impeccable customer service, making decisions in order to keep our business. We have always felt that Mopro really did appreciate our business.

To us, “excellent customer service” has been much more than a marketing slogan at Mopro!

Throughout the years, we’ve also had Mopro competitors relentlessly trying to pull us away. That ain’t happening!

At this time, I am so pleased to submit that the most recent Mopro staff member providing us incredible support on multiple calls and emails is Richard S. He is the epitome of what a support professional should be. I expect that Mopro is extremely proud to have Richard on board!

We look forward to maintaining our partnership with Mopro as long as we are in business and intend to purchase additional Mopro products in the near future.

Congratulations Richard and Mopro,

Jaime Rivera, President

Worst company I have ever dealt with.  Use anyone but them to build your site.  After initial site build there has been zero support with no contact from anyone despite requesting on their help site more than 5 times to be contacted and given a support person to talk to.  Zero contact with a live person.  Have to request help through the web site and hope it gets finished, which it hasn't by the way.  No control to make changes yourself to update items as was promised when signing the original contract< /review>

Service is slow and poor. The administrative functions do not work properly then you have to wait on service for something you should be able to fix yourself. Parts of our website have disappeared even though no one ever even went into edit the website which put us down for business.</Review>

There's social distancing safety in the amount of people they let in at once. As always a wide variety of discounted quality products. Would have been nice if they added another cashier given the length of the line at checkout< /review>

<text>This is a two story Ross, so it has a lot to look at. There's an elevator and carts on both floors. The selection is good, but some organization and arrangement is needed in some isles. I wanted to buy a sponge holder for the kitchen sink and had to look around the shelves to find the suction cups that went with it. I got on my hands and knees and finally found it underneath. Some products don't have price tags, so the manager ballparks a price. It's a good chance to haggle ;)</text>< Date>

Tried to return a perfectly new garment with receipt and tags attached but the horrid associates Angelita and Bernadette did not follow Ross policy and except the return saying that it had to be returned at the exact store purchased from which is not Ross policy<//Review>

I love that you can get some great products for a lower price as long as you're flexible on style, color, etc. I went on a Sunday night, which isn't the best time because many sections of the store have been picked over and people leave things in piles so it's not easy to find what you need. For example, I needed shower curtain hooks. No big deal, right? Things were pulld off the hooks and left in disarray. No wonder their employees are always straightening up the shelves. Overall though, a positive shopping experience. Watch your prices. Not always the very best.<//text>

You have to dig through everything to hunt out good deals. Sometimes the variety is pretty slim. They are open late and work in a pinch when you need something. Checkout can be slow but it's the same everywhere nowadays and I expect that. Worth a look if your in the shopping center.<//Text><Rating>4< /Rating></record>

<review>This is one of the junkiest Ross stores I have seen.  It looks more like a Goodwill or Salvation Army store.  The shelves aren't full or tidy.  Many displays are more than half empty with random products.  There are few employees on the floor if you need assistance.   Maybe this is a sign of the times as a result of rampant shoplifting and constant store staffing cuts.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>I liked this Ross quite a bit. The men's shoe section is relatively small but there was a good selection. I liked the selection of furniture and house wares, and the store itself didnt feel stuffy and overcrowded. Staff was pleasant and helpful.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Always awesome deals to find at Ross. It's a must visit place whenever we visit the USA. You can get branded items for a fraction of the regular price elsewhere. Cannot wait for our next visit to Ross< /text>

<name>Fangfang Ouyang< /name><time>1473199037463< /time><rate>1<//rate><Review>I bought a $139 check-in suitcase from Ross dress for less San Francisco store one week ago. After measured it at home, I realized it was 2" larger than the airline required. I tried to return this brand new one to this store since it is closer, with receipt , name tag as well as all the accessories. Since I haven't used it, everything was at its original package and condition. I also wanted to bought a slightly smaller one as well as a carry on one. The overall $ amount was more than the return $. However, the cashier refused to return it and asked me to return it to the San Francisco store. I requested to speak with her manager. The she called and only told the manager its price and I bought it from SF store. The manager refused to return it as well. Then she found an excuse and said that it had been used! I had to bring it the SF store. The cashier there checked it and returned it without any doubt.

I felt it was their hidden return policy in-between different stores.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808f7c5b7cb9a52d:0xb8e38995a6bfe906</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've seen clothes falling off of the racks, completely disorganized, on several occasions. The shoes will rarely be in the correct size racks. Often times the dressing rooms will have clothes strewn about, ignored by whoever is supposed to clean them.< /Text>

I shop at Ross almost once a week and I went in yesterday with my niece and Gloria the manager was so rude. I can't believe you would have someone like that representing the store. I top of it everything is so unorganized and every time I ask someone if they have something they just say no because they don't wanna spend the time looking through the store. After my horrible experience with Gloria I promise to never step foot in a Ross again.<//review>

The selection is mediocre compared to other Ross stores. It sometimes feels like they're letting inventory run low because they are going to close that store down. Then they get more merchandise in, but as I said, selection isn't great. The bedding and rug areas are always a mess too. The reason I gave them a third star is because they stay open later than the other stores.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Very spacious, everything ordered but the sanitary of sras. They were dirty and do not represent the style or the infrastructure of the store, it is more when we open the door to enter, the employee who is with the key, and assists the people who are trying on the clothes, made an action of covering her nose with the sleeve of his uniform, it is possible that the ventilation of the air is not in good condition, but the cleaning is poor

(Original)
Muy amplio, ordenado todo pero los sanitarios de sras. estaban sucios y no representan  el estilo ni la infraestructura de la tienda, es mas cuando abrimos la puerta para entrar, la empleada que esta con la llave, y asiste a las personas que se estan probando la ropa, hizo un accion de taparse la nariz con la manga de su uniforme, es posible que la ventilación del aire no este en buen estado, pero la limpieza es deficiente< /Text>
