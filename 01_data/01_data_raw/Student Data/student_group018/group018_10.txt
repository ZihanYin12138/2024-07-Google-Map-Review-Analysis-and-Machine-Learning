Every time I bring my son to Kids Dental Group, we both have an amazing experience! From the moment we walk in we are immediately greeted and receive outstanding service. Aside from that I love that the wait is very minimal. The dentist and the assistants are always very kind and professional. I definitely recommend bringing your children, I know I will keep bringing mine!< /text>

Kids Dental Group provides awesome care. I have a toddler who is typically shy and gets easily embarrassed; however, during her first cleaning everyone was so friendly and engaged with her which made her feel comfortable. Because of the awesome care and engagement during our visit, her first cleaning was flawless. She enjoyed her experience and said she wants to go back again.< /Text>

My son loves the dentist now, he wanted to go back the next day. He told me in the morning when he got home from school he was going to use his new floss and brush a 2nd time.  Dr. E is a gem, his staff too.</review>

<review>I want to start off by saying thank you to all the staff. All tho my visit was about 10 minutes. I have a Autistic son and I was hoping for the best and prepared for the worst. I pre warned the staff and they welcomed us with open arms. Well to no surprise my son was not having it but with what little they were able to do they made us so very comfortable. All the staff began greeting and telling my son what a great job he did and how proud they were of him. I felt so moved i fought off my tears. Overall great experience great staff.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>The staff at kids dental group are phenomenal. My child required care beyond what she was originally scheduled for and Dr. Elick was very accommodating. His team were very welcoming, warm, and efficient. I would highly recommend this dental office to anyone seeking care for their child. Additionally, the wait time in the lobby was very short. Social distancing, masks, and temperature checks were also enforced.<//Review><gmapID>0x8094c39b043c3525:0xbd1569c7c0118c45< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Would NOT RECOMMEND!!

Recently moved here from Florida and was in search for a good dental practice geared towards kids

They had great google reviews ( now wondering how many are staff or staff family & friends written ) so I chose here .

BIG MISTAKE!!

If you have children under 7 don't waste your time !!
It's a CHILDREN dental group that charge 125 $ EXTRA if you have a child they consider " fidgety " or needs " a little more time to prep " and a 45$ for oral sedation ( currently studying and you should be warned small kidneys and livers should NOT take this ) they will say it's optional but FORCE it on you !

I had to speak with a manager after my appointment to be refunded the " optional oral sedation 45$ and behavior management fee of 125$ " after explaining they did NOTHING special in time nor did my child have the oral sedation drink smh what a headache!!

Be warned stay away with smaller children !!
A kids dental group that charges EXTRA to deal with children .. smh...

THE IRONY OF THAT!

Yes it's pretty everything that looks nice is not.< /Text>

{'time': 1600172868449, 'text': "Brii, thank you for taking the time to leave us your feedback. We are sad to hear that you didn't have a good experience at our office. We pride ourselves on providing a calm, stress-free environment for our patients and their families. Dr. Elick recommends sedation dentistry for most of our patients, especially under 10, for a multitude of reasons, the main one being that it is less stressful for the child and it creates a fear-free trip to the dentist. He has been doing this safely for many, many years and is recertified every 2 years with the state of California. We understand that some parents may not want to take advantage of sedation dentistry which is perfectly fine.\n\nAlthough we are extremely patient and work very hard to make our patients and their parents comfortable, there are still some children that are too apprehensive to complete treatment using our method of oral sedation. Due to our tight schedule we have to book out more time for certain patients which is why there is an additional fee.  Working in pediatrics can be challenging at times because all children are unpredictable, but we are here to help you and your child anyway that we can.We again apologize that you didn't feel this was accomplished."}<//Resp>

<text>The office is clean and very kid friendly! The front receptionist was not very welcoming, but everyone else we interacted with was polite and kind and great with kids! The wait time seemed to be longer than normal, we arrived 10 min early and waited about 30 minutes past our appointment time to be seen. The dentist was great with my 4 year old and they were very clear about the treatment plan for her! Overall it was a positive experience.< /text><Rate>4</Rate>< gmap_id>

<Review>My children have been patients of Dr. Elick for the past 5 years and we visit routinely every 6 months. We are very happy with this office, love it better than the older and smaller location. The staff is great and caring; they make my children feel comfortable and ease the feeling of "the dentist ." I highly recommend Dr. Elick and staff for your children.< /Review>< Rating>

Kids dental group and Dr. Elic have taken excellent care of my kids for many years. My boys have autism. They are treated like royalty and cared for genuinely. We have appreciated all the years of care! Everyone is always smiling, working hard, and it's a very clean environment! Thank you.</Text>

This is by far the best place to take your children to. We tried smileland dental in Visalia and we had the worse experience. At kids dental we truly felt that the best interest of our son and ours as parents were taken into consideration. Dr Elik was super sweet, amazing, supportive and reassuring. The whole staff was fast in getting my little one seen and also gave exceptional service. They were super flexible and willing to stay late to be able to do the procedure my little one needed. We are super blessed to have found this place.< /review>

I switched all 4 of my girls to a local dentist and Dr. Elick was highly recommended. His staff is so sweet and understanding especially when one of my daughters have a hard time coming in. I don't feel like I have to be worried about if one of them cries. They always make things easier.<//review>

Amazing staff and Dentist, Dr. Elick! Love the layout of the office and the staff were very professional and friendly. It was my three and a half year old’s first dental cleaning and they did amazing. My son is already looking forward to his next visit! Thank Dr. Elick and staff!

*updated 7/22/20** amazing staff once again and extremely patient with my son. Unfortunately my little 4 year old has become not too keen on his appointments but they were extremely patient and understand and took their time with him. Highly recommend!! Thank you once again Dr. Elick and staff!< /review>

Both of my children (11 years old  and the other 4 years old) were terrified about going to the dentist they both left Dr. Elick’s office feeling comfortable and the staff is very caring and compassionate towards them. I will, and I have been recommending Dr. Elick’s  office to anyone with children who are frightened of the dentist. I wish they would see adults as patients! Keep up the good work Kids Dental Group. Sincerely a very happy mom.</Text>

My kids love it here! This practice truly is a great one. Dr. Elick is just a very nice man and awesome with my kids. I wouldn't go anywhere else. I actually live about an hour away and make it my mission to still go here, so you know it's wonderful!   Highly recommend.< /review>

My son had a bad experience at his previous dentist and had some emotional trauma because of it. Dr. Elick and his staff put my son at ease with their gentle ,patient,kind treatment. Thank Dr.Elick and staff for giving my son a great experience at the dentist. He is excited about his next visit.<//Text>

Dr. Elick is awesome with my kids.  He is the one and only doctor we have seen that my 3 year old actually has liked.  I highly recommend him and his staff if you are looking for a great children's dentist in the area.<//Review>

I'm hoping this review may be helpful to parents looking for a new pediatric dentist. We recently moved here, made an appt for end of April. Took about 3.5 weeks to get an appt, which I find to be average for busy pediatric dentists. Staff was very nice and professional. We arrive 20 minutes early to fill out paperwork. Waiting area has TV and a really neat fish tank for kids, but not much else. Waiting room filled up VERY fast to where there was no room to sit and patients were going out into the foyer area to wait. We kept waiting and waiting. Watching all the other people come in after us get called was slightly frustrating without an acknowledgment about how long we were waiting. Another new patient there for a consult said they had been waiting over an hour. After about 40 min, I pick up my cranky un-napped 2 year old and tell the lady that I'm going to have to reschedule. Just then (of course) we get our name called. We walk back and there is ANOTHER waiting room that is packed with kids and parents, nowhere to sit. My 2 year old is off the chain by this point, trying to run everywhere, screaming, no one there to acknowledge how long we all had been waiting. We waited for another 15 min or so. I quickly saw this was going to keep going on. After an hour of being there I scoop up my 2 year old and tell them thanks, but I was leaving and I needed to reschedule. Not a good first impression. I also want to add they do not offer silver diamine fluoride or SDF for young children with cavities that prevents further decay without doing a filling. It's probably one of the greatest things since sliced bread. It prevented my 2 year old from having to deal with sedation. The dentist just paints in on the cavity area every 6 months and off he goes! Why they don't offer this service is beyond me. I wouldn't want to do a filling on a 2 year old.  I hope this office will consider it one day. For now, we found an AWESOME pediatric dentist that does it in Visalia. Got us in for an appt same day and had no wait. I definitely don't expect that quick of service, but waiting an hour to be seen is subpar.<//text>

<Time>1538775518055< /Time><review>WORST EVER, FAKE REVIEWS APPARENTLY. I went here and they wanted to pull 3 of my sons teeth. Threw in cavities, caps, crowns, I can go on and on. Then said he needed a deep cleaning for his teeth, which was a very evasive procedure, I had done once so know and it is NOT covered. Ended up being like a 4000 estimate. I saw red flags. I went and got a 2nd opinion, and it was only 1 tooth pulled, 1 cavity, only ONE tooth needed a deep cleaning which took a few seconds. which ended up being NO out of pocket. so no cost. This office is all about charging for procedures that do not need to be done. Then adding in things that are not needed. At their old office we went in once and they had 2 buildings. They did the expensive procedures in the next door building and charged it as a "hospital" so it was a HUGE price. I told the insurance it is NOT in the hospital, it is in a building attached, next door. Even my insurance said that was shady, go get a 2nd opinion.</review>< userid>

We had a very great experience. Dr.Elick and staff were friendly and professional. The environment was super kid friendly with the decor is amazing. After treatment Dr. Elick gives your kid a token to put n the prize vending machine. Also a bonus your kid gets a certificate for free Bambino kid size pizza 🍕 from Pielogy.< /text>

<user>104944742909681849738</user><username>Kids Recinos< /username><date>1452714673026< /date><rating>1</rating><text>After reading reviews saying that Dr. Elick is great with kids (and being that the other dentists in the area had even worse reviews) we decided to visit the office. My kids (three) all went for a cleaning. At the time two of the three were recommended for dental work. They tried to scam my insurance company by performing services that my son had previously had, were very unprofessional and had the worst attitude when I called to inquire about it. I was also told that it "isn't their job" to check to see if work has been previously done, even though I tried to give them the previous dentist information.

The office is small and cramped and the staff is unfriendly (not all of them, but enough to deter me from ever coming back). I only gave the second star because Dr. Elick was quick and straight to the point. But the girl who were doing the cleanings were messing around, chatting about unprofessional things.

My youngest did actually freak out while we were there and she never has before. She loves going to the dentist. Awful business, we will not be going back.<//text>< Pictures>

Dr Elick has been treating my grandchildren (9) for over 12 years.  The office is set up for children, very professional, the employees work well with the children making them feel comfortable at all times.  One of my granddaughters has cerebral palsy, she loves Dr Elick, she has the biggest smile and hug for him when she sees him.  I can't say enough good things about Dr Elick, I highly recommend him and his staff for any dental needs.< /Text>

The place is a little cramped, and always busy.  If you get an early appointment it is not so bad, but the later in the day you get the more behind they are and the longer you have to wait.  Which is a nightmare when you have three little boys. Staff and the Doc.  are always kind to myself and my kids.<//text>

So devastated that my baby never needed silver caps!😭 and the fact that they wanted to cap his two front teeth and bottoms ones and I said NO to the girls in the front and they where telling me I was putting my child at risk for not letting him put silver caps in the four front .. took my baby somewhere else since we have better insurance now due to this issue and his new dentist told me he never neeeded silver caps so sad now my son is in pain ever since I took him here 😭😭😭🙁🙁</review>

Quality of food seems to have really gone downhill here
Carnitas no longer tasty as they once were
Beef in tacquitos tasted different, strange flavor
Big burrito was mostly cold rice and beans with very little meat
Huge disappointment< /Text>

Mediocre California burrito. Large in size, but small in flavor. Seems the meat wasn't seasoned at all. Luckily their hot sauce bar offered a flavorful habanero hot sauce. Service was speedy and order was correct.</Text>

Love this little family run restaurant. Authentic fresh Mexican food, generous portions, super affordable.

Limited seating, so be flexible, you may need to plan to take food to go for a picnic or to eat at home.</text>

<Response>None< /Response><text>Overall great food! Great people! The manager and the workers are really nice and my dad has developed great relationships with them. We usually get the quesadillas and burritos. However, if they had better cleaning in the bathrooms I would of rated it a 5. It's uncomfortable sitting at the tables near the bathroom.

edit update: this place has been closed down. New location to open very soon in Huntington Beach!<//text>< gmap_id>

The food is great quality here, and for very cheap. There's a few drawbacks though. First is that you have to order chips separately from you order, instead of it being included with most items like many other Mexican restaurants do. The second drawback is that the inside is very small and cramped and can be dirty and loud at times. Because of that, I would recommend coming here for takeout only and taking it to a park or the beach and enjoying it there.</Text>

This is the place to go for authentic Mexican food. Everything is wonderful it's delicious the meats are fresh everything is made to order and I've never had a bad time here. And their food serving portions are monstrous so sometimes it's even reasonable to get something it to split with another person but if you're really hungry and you really want authentic Mexican food delicious Mexican food which includes Carnitas carne asada chicken tongue this is the place to come and there's usually one of the owners in the place. Los Primos has always been one of my favorites because I am never left wanting more. This is one of the smarter eateries that happily give you more than enough. And they have awesomeness superific breakfast burritos yum yum yum!!</review>

Great service, I come in every Sunday after church and they've memorized my order! Plus it's far faster and more affordable than fast food places like Del taco.<//Text>

I ate here everyday while training at the Art of Jujitsu.
The food was delicious and very healthy.
Pricing was quite fair considering the portions.
Combined with Banzai Bowls which is in the same strip mall I was recovering from training several times a day quite well.</review>

<text>OMG! This place is simple and to the point! Order your Mexican food at the counter and eat it in the shop or togo. They have a nice selection of cold bottle sodas and fountain drinks! Want a big burrito, try the Vegetarian Burrito! This thing will feed a family it's so long! It's like the length of a Foot-long Subway sandwich but the thickness of a chipotle burrito. Soo yummy too! Fresh cilantro and tasty salsa. And they keep the price under chipotle but twice the amount of food! What's not to love!< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
This is a great cantina, very authentic Mexican food. You can tell any weekday from 11:30 to 1:00 by the line of Hispanic workers out the door. I went there almost every day when working nearby and had to stop eating the burritos because I was gaining weight.  I estimate each burrito is over a pound and delicious. Choose from Carnitas, Pollo, Carne Asada, Pesca or they even have Breakfast burritos with 2 eggs. Black or refried frijoles. Really hot salsas and other treats on the side board. And this is only the burritos.  They have enchiladas, Chile Relleno, tostadas, tacos and more. They also supply take away for parties, and they take phone orders.  I love my Cousins, but I don't go there too much any more, I don't want to be the Gordo Viejo!!!< /Review>

I adore this restaurant! They offer superb dishes, they have a rich menu, The chief cook in that restaurant is a specialist, I like a lot tasting all their dishes. The food is always good, the service towards the guests  is friendly. I  go often to this restaurant and I was never unhappy. I recommend it to all.</Text>

Worker told these guys to go outside because there was enough people in side ( social distancing) and also because they didn’t have mask. She wasn’t even following the rules herself because she didn’t have a mask on and was making our food without a mask on. Before entering the place, it says they are requiring mask.<//review>

I have came to this location on Tulare several times when they were supposed to be on operational hours and door was locked and no one to be seen. The best way I can explain it is if the opening worker runs the place the way they choose too. I just dont understand how Mr.Petters keeps allowing all these complaints and not look into the problem. It's a inconvenience to drive to this location when there supposed to be open for service and have to turn away and waist gas to travel to another location. MR. Petters you need to get it together..</Text>

Told me to go to another Romeos.  I asked them what time they closed.  They told me six and were closing up.  Got home looked on Google maps, said they closed at nine.< /Text>< Pics>

2.) Then I ordered subs and when attempting to pay, was told they do not accept EBT anymore.
3.) She looked like she didn't even want to deal with a customer and what she said was delivered with such apathy I felt awkward as I attempted a joke/smile exit after a complete waste of time</review>< Response>

<Review>Although the food is great... the service was Extremely Tacky.... the girls that were behind the counter were to busy gossiping and playing around with some little kid from which they were stashing him under the counter as they were giving him little bags of chips to keep him quiet. The Girls were very rude to my niece and I....<//Review>< user>

<text>Didn't even order. The website is not associated with this location. Instead of the lady telling me that nicely, she was very rude over the phone. I have worked food service and custome service for a long time and this was unacceptable. The manager/supervisor should train their employees on better customer service over the phone and/or in person. Apparently this is a problem with most Romeo's in town. I had the same rude attitude from the Cedar and Shields location as well. Very disappointing.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

They only hire women (Which is just weird), they ignore you and gossip about their own lives to each other in front of you, not all of them but most of them are rude and have no patients, the place is dirty. One time I ordered a sub with NO dressing and they covered it in dressing.. Then when I asked them to remake it, they picked off the dressing... Yes you read that right- Picked off the dressing.. When I informed her that you cant pick off a liquid and that I didnt want my sub with dressing that has washed the tips of your fingers off onto my sub, she said shes not gonna remake it.. So i asked for a refund, she rudely did it and then wouldnt serve me again and told me to leave.. Like I felt like I was in the twilight zone.. It was amazing that she could look at me like Im the one in the wrong... Thats this store in a nutshell. The one on Ventura/Kings Canyon and Winery-ish (Next to Gamestop) is good. Theyre nice and friendly, I suggest you go to that one. GL.< /Review>

< Review>
The Worker was really rude and had a very bad attitude. She didn't even wash her hands . She was very disrespectful and my overall experience there was horrible. I will never spend money there in my lifetime. First and tulare needs new workers there. And I am gonna file a complaint. I am also gonna find out her name so future customers won't have to go through what I did. Its a shame because I love romeos pizza's and sub sandwhiches :-(< /Review>

< review>
These girls are so rude they don't have no manners to their customers every time I call like around 7 to order they never pick up the phone and when I get there at 8 I asked them what time they close and they say 8:30 and it's not even 8:30 its 8 they're closing so early  I asked for their manager and they say they don't have manager what kind of business is this that they don't have a manager</review>

My favorite bunch of people. Regulars are nice and experienced dog owners. Please respect the posted park regulations. The park is a public place, but listen and respect the directions of the group as there are reasons for the directives.<//text>

< review>
I like this dog park. Plenty of comfortable seating, shade and parking spaces. The main park is all wood chips, so the dogs don’t get very dirty. There is another park connected with grass, but it’s only open on certain days. There’s a water fountain for the dogs. My only complaints would be the small dog park was tiny and not much in there. There aren’t any rocks or things for the dogs to climb, other than tables and benches. But there is a hill they can run up towards the back.<//review>

Apparently this park is closed. There were barricades at the road but space to enter/exit between them. There was a creepy guy, who seemed to be living out of his car, directing us and the car in front of us to leave. Not a good experience when we’re driving from Santa Barbara to Orange County with two dogs and had looked for a dog park to stop on the way.< /Review>

My beagle puppy is like a jackrabbit and always moving, gnawing, shredding, and doing whatever to play and cause trouble. This was perfect! He ran for 2 hours straight and it didn’t matter whether the other dogs chased or followed, or how BIG they were! Dog heaven. It was like putting a teenage boy on a football team.....too tired to cause trouble!😀< /text>

I don't have a dog, however there's a trail head there called the Millennial trail for mountain biking that is AWESOME. 17 miles of the most excellent single track trails around. See the creepy fountain in the middle of nowhere, experience the death defying Cliff of Insanity switchbacks or the Pyramid switchbacks, all together there are over 50 switchbacks. It's a big that brings you right back to the Bark Park.< /text>

<Review>A relatively small dog park with three sections - small and large dog spaces (though no one seems to close the gate between them), both covered with bark chips, no grass, and a large section that is grassy but only open in the summer on weekends. Water for the dogs, poop bags and rakes/shovels for pick up, waste cans, and shaded benches. There are lights on timers for after dusk. Plenty of parking. IT IS NOT WELL MARKED so it is easy to drive past.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I usually go to Victory and Balboa and this was the first time at the Bark Park and we loved it.  It's smaller but not too small and had water fountain and clean up tools for my fur child! Annabelle ( chocolate lab) was 4 today and we had a blast! All the owners were introducing their fur kids to me and looked out for everyone.  It was very grassy and clean no spots of dirt or mud.  It was a good Birthday Exercise and experience for Annabelle and myself and we will definitely go back!< /Text>

My dog was killed by a white  American bulldog (aka pitbull) at this park.
The owner was a jerk as well as his clique friends who are regulars there.
The owner took no responsibility for his dog's vicious deadly action.
Beware of this guy and his vicious dog.<//Text>

<review>I called to see if they were open. Apparently, someone speaking only Spanish answered. When I asked if they cut men's hair they hung up. Then refused to answer the phone repeatedly.
I think I'll stop by since they are less than a mile from my home and let them know my thoughts on how they treat potential new customers. Then, I'm going to buy the building they lease the space in. Next, I'm going to contact the city (state, and federal) taxing authorities to make sure their business licenses and taxes are up to date. Next, the health department certifications. Then, immigration status (since citizenship exams can only be taken in English). I'm assuming ICE will be very interested in the people that run this establishment. If all else fails (since am buying the building) I will get a demolition permit from the city. Then I'll take my $345,000.00 bulldozer and demolish their business.
My goal will be to destroy their liberally protected (probably illegal) business! All over 1 phone call to learn how they treat people. It may cost me $2-$4M to get rid of them but, I will. They are rude, and probably are an illegal business anyway.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Always have a great experience here. My go to for my haircut is with Daisy never has failed me with my hair. I also recommend Maribel, the staff here is nice and respectful. The prices are reasonable as well. Just make sure to bring a small car or get here early because the parking here is pretty small.< /text>

Then finally one lady that was doing  Laundry on the caps  looked at us  Confused, then asked the other ladies what were we waiting for, they both said I don't know. Then she walked over and said what are you here for.....REALLY....for a burger and fries....for a haircut.....I can't.....so we left after letting her how we waited for 1hr & 37min....so said its because we were so busy....🤨👎✌< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Wouldn’t even be giving one star at all. Crystal did a horrible job at bleaching my hair. Had me wait for my appointment and on top of that wasn’t prepared..the bleach was left on longer than I expected it to be and it fried my hair...never coming here. To top it off She cut my hair a lot  after bleaching it to hide the damage ..I had long hair now it’s almost shoulder length. I’m so upset because it’s right near Christmas too.< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great craftsmanship on my new custom muffler system! Currently at the beginning stages of a full renovation/rebuild of a retro motorhome.  Chris and his team are honest and friendly. I'll be recommending future clients to Mufflers West! Check out below the before and after photos. Cheers!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>In 2019 I started coming here for repairs, everything that I want from a service provider is here, excellent work, honest, time sensitive to our truck and trailer needs for hauling our animals. As far as pricing goes it's not only been fair but they actually helped us out on some wiring repairs at no charge.
Having 30 years experience in auto repair and insurance claims background allows me to have a pretty good sense of a good shop and when I find a good service provider I stick with them, also it's easier and better for keeping track of repairs that way;
Mufflers West is on that list now of trusted service providers.</Review>< userid>

<text>Knowledgeable, Experienced, and Honest!  My 2010 Nissan Altima Coupe had an exhaust leak caused by a crack between my catalytic converter and exhaust manifold.  I called Rancho Smog who has performed smog checks on my 2 vehicles for years, and I asked them if the knew a good honest mechanic who could weld the crack.  They referred me to West Muffler.  I called and spoke to the owner Chris, and I told him about the crack.  Chris then explained to me in detail the crack as thou he was actually looking at it.  I told Chris that's exactly what the crack looked like.
Chris said it was not to uncommon, and he has weldeled a few of those on my make and model.  I knew right then I had someone who was both knowledgeable and experienced.  He gave me an estimate over the telephone, and I set an appointment.  The day I took my car in for repair they completed the work in a timely manner, and I paid exactly what Chris quoted me over the telephone.  My car now runs quiet.  Thank you Chris!</text><username>Daniel Winans< /username></record></dataset><record>

This guy is solid. Very thankful I came across his business. I will definitely be using him for multiple services in the future. Great prices, super honest ,and trustworthy. My family and I recently moved to the area so it was hard for me to find someone I could trust but Chris is the man. He changed out my catalytic converter on my camaro and did multiple services on my car to ensure that everything was working properly. My car is running better than It ever was once Chris finished working on it. Highly recommend this guy and his team!<//review>

Chris at Mufflers West offered professional, knowledgeable, and friendly service.   Chris not only did a really great job, he went above and beyond to get the exhaust placement moved so that the little fender could go back on my little RV after my accident.
Mufflers West is the place if you want it done right by someone that cares!< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>This morning I discovered all four of wheel hubs on my boat trailer were extremely hot after a short tow across town and contacted Mufflers West, since I've been a customer for several years with several vehicles and trailers. I explained my concern since I was planning on leaving at 3am for my first family boat trip of the year and even though Chris was booked for the day he offered to take a look at it. After an inspection, Chris replaced all wheel bearings in both axles and got me back on the road in no time. Their prices are very reasonable and their work is excellent. This type of customer service is exactly why I am supportive and loyal to businesses like this!< /review>< Pictures>

<text>I don’t leave many reviews but Chris and Mufflers West deserve my time. Chris squeezed me into his schedule to put on a cat-back system. Then he squeezed me in again to take it off when I didn’t like it LOL. Great guy and great work, he really knows his stuff. Highly recommended and I’ll definitely be back.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Great shop I stopped in for a motorcycle muffler & he was very upfront & said it was more than what he could do with his equipment & he referred me to Raw Motorsports. I appreciate his honesty & his referral. Most shops would just say no I can't help you & good luck.
I will definitely remember this and when I need any exhaust work for my cars I will return here.
Thank you so much for your advise.< /Review>< gmapID>

<pics>None< /pics><username>Ashley Driver</username><review>Chris is wonderfully kind and professional. I took my husband's 2500 Ram here to get a 5th wheel hitch installed. I knew little about the trailer (aside from make, model, length and dry weight), but that did not stop Chris! He did the research and put together a couple of options for me. I took the pickup in, and it was done the same day. The workmanship is excellent, the price was competitive, and the service was stellar. I could not be more appreciative or pleased with the entire experience.
I highly recommend Chris and Mufflers West. I would not go anywhere else.<//review>< userid>

My dad has a car shop and I have swapped my daily driver quite frequently, I try to mod every car I own as well, so I come to them for all my exhaust needs. These guys know what there doing, and their service is great. Super happy with how all my cars have turned out, I will for sure be back for the next project.<//Text>

They did a great job replacing my stock muffler with a dynomax I bought online. Super fast on the install and the price was fair. I would definitely recommend Mufflers West.<//text>

When I picked it up, it didn’t need as much work as expected. Instead of making me pay the quote, he charged me less. It’s nice to have some honest companies out there. Will be going there every time I need work done!< /text>< pictures>

Just a heads up ! I took my flatbed trailer in two years ago to have the wiring repaired and all the wheel bearings repacked . Initially I thought this place was top notch . I was treated very well . I picked up the trailer and took it to Vegas where it set in my backyard until I used it recently. I was going about 100 miles and stopped about 25 miles down the road to check the hubs and they were warm to hot . I returned to town and removed one of the 4 wheel hubs to find a bit of new red grease and some old black gritty grease . It was very obvious the bearings had NOT been repacked. I removed the other 3 to find only one had a bit of new red grease in the hub . Old black grease was still in the bearings and there was not much . The other 2 had no new grease in the hubs at all but the same old old old black gritty grease they were supposed to clean out and replace with new . You would never know until you have an issue and have to take it all apart . It was also obvious the inner bearings had not been removed to be repacked as the seals were still crusted with old grease/dirt . I hope the person that was supposed to have done the work has lost their job by now . This practice would be very easy to do to others and you wouldn’t know till sometime down the road or you took them apart yourself to check .
I realize some will say I don’t know what I’m talking about and too much time has past . I do know what was done and was not done and half the work I paid for was not done at all !! BEWARE. !!!! If you have time do it yourself. I did not have time .< /Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1547613788434, 'text': 'Jeffrey, I’d like to apologize if our work was less than satisfactory to you. As you stated, you brought in your trailer to us for service over two years ago. We reccomend bringing your trailer in for service every year as the grease in the bearings will not stay red/pink and will turn black over the course of time. It’s been almost 3 years since you’ve had yours serviced and its normal for discoloration to occur. We always double check our work and do not take any shortcuts when doing a job. Regardless, we would like to make things up to you. Please come in any time or call us to discuss what we can do to make things right and keep your business, thank you !'}</Resp><gmap_id>0x80db7fd2aa9d99fb:0xbb4f76e8f724fba0< /gmap_id></record>

But shortly after the first session I was tooken care very professionally and I was very pleased with how they treated me fairly for both customer service wise and price wise. I would definitely recommend any other students Highschool or college to come here.

<review>This muffler shop is truly amazing. Great communication skills and outstanding people. They're focused on making the customer happy. I needed a custom exhaust for my car and without hesitation they started suggesting different types that would fit my budget and needs. This was the best muffler shop that I've been too and now I'm ready to hit the road with my and improved car! I highly recommend them for anything related to automobiles and they're the best in the business.<//review>< GmapID>

I have used Mufflers West, for my new B&W goose neck hitch install, axel work, brakes on my fith weel and muffler on a 94 ranger. All jobs were clean and high quality. I reccomend this shop for all your trailer, muffler and hitch needs.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I own several horse trailers and they needed to be serviced on the liftgates as well as regular repair on body components and I asked all of my buddies in horse community where to go for service and they all suggested to go to Mufflers West for any of my trailer needs. As soon as I was there I was welcomed by Chris who was very knowledgable on all of my trailer needs, he knew exactly what needed to be taken care of. I had expected to leave my trailer there for a few weeks but was pleasantly surprised to hear that it will be ready to pick up in just one day! I would recommend anyone who needs any trailer services to only go to Mufflers West, they know exactly what needs to be done and take half the time that any other shop would take(I have had bad experience with other shops)!<//review>

I am a mechanic myself and i know when i say that these guys really know there stuff. Needed  a catalytic converter for my 2001 Is300 Lexus. I  called all around town and match prices and checked rates. Not only did they provide me with the best price they were very fast and professional at  all times. Very friendly staff and the work was to the tip. I give a 5 star rating because they truly deserve it. Thanks A lot happy to save money and have good service.  Definitely will be back and  recommended all my family and friends.</Text>

LOVE my Pink Store. There is one clerk, who's name I do not know. My son and I refer to him as "The Happy Man". He always smiles, asks about me and specifically about my son. We love him. As a corner convenience store, it always has what we want, or need. The staff in general are great. Joan is a doll. Z...well....he can be cranky. The location is perfect, less than two blocks from our home. The staff tolerates my ex-husband, especially Jonathan. Jonathan is earning his angel wings. Shop at this store. Get to know the staff. Be a part of the neighborhood  community.< /Text>

<review>4th St.Market is a liquor store and mini market with a deli.  They have every soda available and the deli sandwiches are really good.  The owner is friendly as is the staff.  They are open until midnite and masks are required to enter the business.< /review>< Pictures>

I love this shop. Its kind of a general store. The most unusual items can be found. An excellent selection of tobacco. Also a very impressive selection of liquors and beers. The parking is very ample and is very convenient to the 101</Review>

<Review>Forget how shabby it looks inside and out, and forget about the wall of grimy, soot covered people hanging out in front. The people who work there are great, they have bottle caps and the 2nd cheapest cigarettes in town.<//Review><Name>Tony Persico<//Name>< GmapID>

I am a regular patron to this store for more than 3 yrs. Was accused on Jan 24 of.Drinking in parking lot by clerk. First time this ever happened to me. I will be taking this up with owner .   Bottle unopened doesn't mean drinking.  Your emloyee has issues.<//review>

If it's not there they can order it but they probably have it type record place. Bigger than the Campbell store definitely more knowledgeable, when selling records there's not a better place in the area. Outstanding service. These guys love what they do.<//text>

Great place to be if you are a music enthusiast. Friendly staff. Awesome vinyl collection for great prices. Even some of the older ones in boxes below turned out to be in G/VG condition. Prepare to spend at least 30-45mins searching for music you love. Definitely recommend this place if you are getting started on a vinyl collection.</review>

Nice shop, wide variety. Most impressed by trade in value. I took a handful of records to another local shop and was offered $15 in cash, $18 in trade value, which seemed super low. I then brought the same records here and was offered $45 cash and $60 in trade value. This shop offers the best value for trading in records in at least the South Bay area. I'll be back!<//Review>

amazing place for those who love vinyl...and music in general.  this place definitely has that "record store" feel to it.  great selection of used needle to the groove, at great prices; they're priced so that when tax is added, it comes out to a flat amount (you really don't have to worry about having change).< /review>

<Text>Outstanding selection of vinyl to leisurely look through. Some real gems. Records are well cared for, and organized in a manner that allows you to narrow your search. They'll put a platter on, so you can check the condition. Cool place.</Text>< pictures>

This store sold me two fake vinyls and I am extremely angry! They sold me a 2020 Cherry Bomb vinyl and a 2017 Flowerboy Vinyl (Both Fake Special Editions). He charged be 80 dollars for it and I was very happy because I woke up at 3 a.m. just to get this vinyl. Once I asked a friend he told me both were fake. I immediately confronted the owner ,but he tried to change the subject and told me there were more in the San Jose location. This store tried to scam me by paying full price for fake items. The store could easily get shut down. They last time deleted my review of this place so the stars are biased. Once I asked the owner where he got them he immediately gave my money back and tried to ignore me. Some service! I did not wake up at 3 A.M to get ignored and sold fakes!!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1600999700565, 'text': "THIS REVIEW FOR THE WRONG LOCATION!

Great record shop. I had a little time while visiting San Jose before a flight and I stopped by because,  well,  records. The selection was great - different from what I see in Southern California as it should be. All genres were represented. The jazz collection was strong as well as Rock.   The punk was fair but I felt it was a little thin on Indie. Hip Hop was well represented and so were 7 inches. Staff was friendly and prices were fair.<//review>

However, if you are willing to pay the extra money, you'll get a high quality album with no scratches or dings of imperfection.

This is a great record store.
+1star for a listening station; seems to be a dying thing to listen to a vinyl before you opt to buy it.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Always  excited  to go in and buy used LP's. Happy to go home with those LP's , I bought for less. Smells better inside  than the other  vinyl store places I go to. And love  the plastic sleeves they case on them.<//Review>

Well organized record shop.  Very helpful staff.  Did not have exactly what I was looking for, but I found several other interesting LPs.  Great selection of old and new music, a variety of genres, and first and re-press/issue LPs.  New stuff coming in all the time.  And, they have listening stations.  Definitely coming back.< /Review>

<review>Super cool record shop with many high quality vintage records to choose from. The friendly guy running the place took the time to check out the vinyl on all 5 LPs that I purchased to make sure they were in good shape. Check it out.</review>< pics>

I just recently got into DJing and Scratching and there's nothing like the feeling of doing it on wax. Thank god for thid record shop that has a large collection of vinyl new and used. Some R
Rare stuff can get pricey, but you can find some gems for $10, $7, $5, and even $1!< /Text>

Best record store in San Jose. High quality vinyl and customer service. Clean! Bring coins for the parking meters. Your 50 dollar recording buy day can turn into a 95 with that 45 ticket...<//Review>

< Review>
Went there this past saturday morning and left the selection however after being inside for 10 minutes went outside to check on the car to find a $40 parking ticket...

apparently the only day the meters aren't required are sunday but there is still a 30 minute limit so you have to do your record shopping quick!!<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>There is no place in Visalia to get better fried rice. One of these days I will find out your secrets Lao Noodle House!! One thing I love about this establishment is their sizes. They have a variety of sizes for every dish, from small to either extra-large or extra-extra-large (I can't quite remember)
Let me tell you, an extra-large fried rice will last you a couple days, and it's just as good reheated! You can also get amazing soup or pad Thai here, depending on whatever your craving. Don't forget to add on a Thai iced tea and some chicken and rice to make the perfect meal.
The staff is so friendly and interactive- the owner and his son are really fun to chat with!
Keep in mind they only accept cash payment. As of right now, it's only take-out due to COVID, so they'll remind you on the phone that it's cash only. Honestly not a big deal for me personally but it is a good thing to remember.
For the three years I've lived in the area, Lao Noodle House has been a regular visit for me, and that's not going to change any time soon!</review>< gmap_id>

It's good food, but for those looking for full restaurant service it's not here. The staff is very friendly and good but it's a hole in the wall kinda place. The pad thai is amazing.< /Review>

Best pho in Visalia! You’ll usually have to wait for a table because the seating is limited but it’s well worth it!<//Text>

<Text>Noodle House is a hidden gem of the central valley. Nowadays people come for the Pho & chicken with sticky rice. The true treasure of this friendly, family operated restaurant is the Khaosoy, a Lao soup with ground beef, cabbage and thick noodles. Absolute comfort food and a must have.<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp><userid>106689568632774589786< /userid>< user_name>

Noodle house omg when you want the best phó in Visalia in my opinion go there I've been a customer for 15 years and everytime I go it always and I mean always hits the spot.
From the phó the kasoy the pad Thai the best fried rice and the only one my son will eat from a Thai restaurant btw lol. It all is good quality made food I just wish I could afford to eat there every day lol<//Text>

Horrible communications! Had an appointment to come in and they called me the day before and said they had me scheduled for CT scan , but I was coming in for MRI ! Since I was sitting in a barbers chair at the moment I said I would check my paperwork and call back in 20 minutes. When I called back ,I was on hold for 20MINUTES before a woman answered and said I would have to call a different number . I called that number and was again on hold for a long time , got frustrated and hung up. I tried a third time and got through to the office and was told to hold for the original person I talked with. After about 5 minutes , a recorded voice simply said "Goodbye" and hung up . I finally replied to cancel my appointment via text . Won't go back to any of their locations, they're too swamped and don't have enough office staff to assist clients.</Text>

<Text>I am a 74 year old with incredible back pain issues. They Gave me an 8:40 PM APPT on Friday night.  After the procedure about 9:30 the technician said I was done and immediately ducked out a side door never to be seen again. I got dressed and Gathered my things all alone in the dimly lit back area. I found my way alone to the reception area where the attendant was locking up the doors to their suite. I told her my husband was picking me up and would be there within 5 minutes and asked her if I could wait in their reception area. “Nope, we’re closed. You can sit out there” pointing to the large general reception area for the building. She immediately left and I was all alone in this empty building whose main door right ON Beach Blvd was-unlocked. I was in pain, alone and abandoned in this empty unsecured building. Didn’t feel any concern for my comfort or safety at all. I have made two calls to the site and to the manager of the site and they never called me back. DO NOT GO HERE ALONE AT NIGHT because they’re not going to extend any courtesy or concern.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Had MRI and once in the back for imaging the staff in the back are incredibly kind and professional. Front staff however are not. My insurance also called since they over charged me and my insurance rep said that she was sent to billing and a rep named Shante was extremely rude to her. Unfortunate,  bc this facility is very clean and if not for front office staff and billing staff would give a 5 stars.<//Review>

I had  no problems with the service at the facility. I was there for a CT Scan in October 2020. It's what happened afterwards that's the problem. I was told no copay was due, that I would be billed. I guess I was billed and it was sent to this address: 1234 Huntington Beach, CA. Needless to say, I never received it, so it was not paid. Now we're being hounded by a collection agency. We called Radnet/Memorial Care 4 times to try get this resolved, and spoke to 2 different supervisors, who told us not to pay the collection agency. We're still getting calls from the collection agency. We made more calls this morning and waiting to get it resolved.

We had a similar experience several years ago after a visit to the Huntington Beach Memorial Urgent Care facility.</Review>

I was in a lot of pain when I went to my appointment however the technician Brittany was so kind and gentle,  she truly made my experience very pleasant. I m extremely pleased. I was treated with the most kind heart and gentle spirit. She treated me as if I was her mom or someone she genuinely cared for. I would recommend this imaging place above any others. Brittany thank you so much for your professionalism and care.<//Text>

<date>1590792596855<//date><Text>Today was my second visit to Memorial Care Imaging on Beach Blvd.  in Huntington Beach. On both occasions, the facility was clean and the waiting area is spacious and comfortable. I was greeted by the same woman both times. She is very professional, prompt and friendly. There was a very brief wait. The technicians made eye contact and introduced themselves. Today, I had the pleasure of meeting Asia. On each visit, the technician communicated with me and explained everything that they were doing. I can't imagine how anyone could do better. It was a great experience and I'm extremely satisfied.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Calling was an experience to say the least when asking for directions the lady at the front answering the phones was so confused. While sitting in front of the building I asked if this was the correct place she said that the building was white and grey. So I asked if the suit was upstairs or on what side of the building and she replied no it’s a grey and white building! I was entertained honestly. Staff was chill great service very fast.< /review>

<date>1595731761441</date><rate>5</rate><Review>I needed to get an MRI on my left knee. Went to Memorial Care Imaging Center, which is a brand new building just off Beach Blvd in Huntington Beach, CA.
The receptionist had the paperwork already prepared so it was quick to fill out. Then the Technician immediately brought me into the imaging room. She was really sweet. After the MRI was done, it was a quick sign out and I was on my way. It was an easy in and out process and of course, they took all the necessary Covid protocols.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
The technician who performed my ultrasound was excellent. During the process she explained everything as she was doing it. She was thoughtful in making sure that she prevented the gel from getting on my clothing, as well as making sure I was comfortable on the table. In general, her “bedside manner” was stellar. I’m sorry I forgot her name.

The receptionist was also polite and efficient.< /Review>

My Technician (Nicole) was very professional, she explained the Sonogram process in detail (Thank You) and made me feel very comfortable during the process. She’s very passionate about her profession and the service she is providing.
She checked and rechecked the area examined
twice to make sure she didn’t miss anything.

<Review>Even whilst we all adjust the to COVID-19 era, Memorial Radiation were kind enough to squeeze me on a same day double MRI scan.

The two Ladies at the reception were most kind and efficient at their various duties and compassionate towards my injuries.

All appropriate CDC guidelines are strictly observed and fellow patients were of the ‘aware’ folks causing no drama for staff or Patients- which was nice to perceive.

When in need again of Memorials services - and my condition shall assure that, I shall not think twice of returning.

If a human reads this- I would be most grateful were you to take a moment to thank the 2 Ladies on duty at 16:00hrs yesterday 6/21/20

I only sat and waited for 5-7 minutes before being called for my appointment.  The technician, Melody, who completed the test was excellent.  She described fully what she was going to occur throughout the procedure.  She also asked if I was comfortable a number of times.</Review><Response>None</Response></record>

<Text>I arrived 1 hour prior to my appointment time as instructed. However, I waited for an hour and 30 minutes in a freezing cold front waiting room with no one keeping me updated. (My test required that I was fasting and I had to drink 3 big glasses of water!) Finally I went to the desk and she took me to the back waiting room and a nice woman gave me a blanket. Everyone was very nice but I felt like I’d been forgotten. I don’t know what happened but I think the communication could have been better.< /Text>< name>

Very courteous, quick, and professional staff. From the front to the techs, they all make your more than likely bad experience (since I’m sure your not there by choice or for the best of reasons) as good as can be. Also, quick turn around on results which helps you to not play that long thinking game which is the worst.  if you got to get some testing done, I highly recommend here. Quick and painless. Well somewhat painless considering I was in pain before I went in...<//Review>

Procedure was a little intimidating but the tech was awesome and helped me through the tunnel of healing. Held onto the little help button the whole time. After it was over it was a piece of cake.Great job, thank you.<//text>

How does this place have this high of a rating? 2 hours and counting of waiting after being told 1 hour. Not enforcing masks, with people wearing their masks over their chin in a small waiting room. Go elsewhere.<//Text>

<username>Lynnetta rose</username><Review>First time at this location.  Front desk was kind and efficient.  The gentleman who took my CT scan was warm; calm; kind and reassuring.  Something very sensitive and special about him.  I wish I could have gotten his name in my memory!!  I'd like to mention him by name.  He also made sure I had the key where my belongings we're located. In a nutshell for a very sensitive issue I felt safe, cared for, protected and respected by him and the front desk staff.< /Review>< gmapID>

<text>It was rather youthful today with the staff being all under the age of 25 it seems. I like the in and out process, now delay in getting checked in, and MRI’ are quick. I love that it’s close to home, especially with an evening appointment. Do I recommend this fascist, of course I do.</text>< Pictures>

Super smart imagining center with really nice workers. Went for an MRI of the shoulder and the machine is state of the art 😜
Last place I went to I felt like I was a torpedo been put into a torpedo shoot as super narrow, not here!

My disc was ready within just a few minutes too...
Thank you guys!!!< /Text>

Excellent service.   My imaging required a contrast which means a needle.  I have a needle phobia. The medical professionls were kind and understanding despite the fact that I was a very difficult patient.  Reggie should get a bonus or gold star for putting up with me. Thank you.  The front desk staff were also outstanding. Patrick< /Text>

I was very pleased with my visit to Memorial Imaging this afternoon. Everyone was friendly but professional. If I had to single one thing out it would be TONYA at the front desk. She exhibited personal interaction skills that can’t be taught. Tonya is certainly an asset to your organization.</Review>

Had a spine MRI here this past week and it was fantastic!  The facility is super modern and clean.... the reception desk had the most helpful and friendly staff that checked you in and out.  The technician, Asia was so professional and explained the entire procedure, seem less!  As a complicated orthopedic patient, I truly enjoyed the staff and the modern facility.  Great job Memorial... I hope all of my diagnostics can be done at your location!</text>

The staff is great, very friendly and knowledgeable. The location is very easy to find, covered parking is just steps away. Overall a very comfortable atmosphere. And you even get a free DVD of your scan 😉<//text>

Ladies at the front desk not very helpful or friendly but MRI technician was outstanding. Super friendly and explained to me all the process including the basics. Totally humane treatment. Very update and high tech location.</Review>

I had to get an ultrasound here at 9:00 Thursday morning, and my experience was nothing but positive!  The staff was hella professional; the receptionist notified me that the technician was running behind so I may wait longer than normal, but still it was less than 10 minutes.  The ultrasound tech was efficient and friendly, and helped me understand the process better.  Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs imaging done.<//text>

I had such a great experience! I walked in on a Saturday to get several X-rays and Alex was awesome! He got me checked in, verified my insurance, explained how every series of X-rays was going to happen, and was very patient with positioning me since I have mobility issues. He is an amazing technician and person. While I was leaving, an elderly couple was waiting and he was so sweet to them as well. Thanks Alex!< /review>

I had a great experience here last Friday, 12/21/2018. I didn’t have to wait around too long, staff are helpful and informative. The technician who administered my CT scan was exceptional. He informed me every step of the way so I would know what to expect and didn’t get scared of the unknown. He was also very gentle with the needle. Thank you.< /Text>

My experience at Memorial care imaging Center was all that it should have been my paperwork was waiting for me, everyone I dealt with was pleasant and personable, and the technician who took care of my MRIs was considerate, efficient, and thorough. He took care of everything in a very professional way and was very clear and his explanation. I was seen on time, and the process was finished in a timely way. The only negative in my experience was all of the paperwork That I realize Hass to be done for a procedure such as an MRI.< /text>

This morning I went to MemorialCare Imaging Center in Huntington Beach for a CT. I was very happy with the service and care they offered. I was greeted upon entering the reception area and everyone there was very courteous and friendly. I was called promptly and everything was clearly explained. I was treated with respect. I recommend this Imaging Center very highly. They are professional and caring.<//review>

X-ray tech was thoughtful and considerate as it was difficult to maneuver for the x-ray due to recent heart surgery. I was a walk in with no appointment and I was in and out in less than thirty minutes. Mission statement success in my opinion.</review>

If you have 3 hours to spare come here. Came in for a chest X-ray for work and was stuck here for 3 hours. Didn’t even look super busy like many other facilities do. So after waiting for 1.5 hours and got sent to radiology next door the lady at the front is super rude and all I told her was that I was checking in for my X-ray. Never ever returning here. Rather use my insurance and pay out of pocket to go somewhere else than to waste three valuable hours.<//Review>

I wanted to share the experience I just had with Memorial Care Imaging, both the Newport Beach and Huntington Beach offices. I was scheduled this morning for an ultrasound at 8:30am, and unfortunately I received a call from a representative at the Newport Beach office that their ultrasound machine was not working. Instead of just scheduling me for the next time that their machine would be functioning, the representative, whom I apologize for not remembering her name, made the effort to reschedule me for just under (3) hours later at the Huntington Beach office. Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted by a young man who checked me in (again, I apologize for not remembering his name). He was very professional, attentive, and helped make me feel comfortable. He was not only that way with me, but also with other patients who checked in thereafter. Nicole, the technician who conducted the ultrasound, was just wonderful. She was also very professional, attentive to my concerns, and very trusting from the moment she called me and took me back to the examination room. I just left their office, and I will say that this was one of the best experiences I have ever had. Thanks to everyone at both the Newport Beach and Huntington Beach offices for making patients like myself feel comfortable.<//Text>

Very professional! Walked in, filled out some quick paperwork because it was my first time. I had to do some xrays. I was in and out within a half hour. I will come to this location in the future if anything is needed for me and my family, even though it’s a little out of my way. Thanks!!</Text>

If a doctor from upstairs orders an ultra sound or X-ray they should be able to accommodate the patient to get them done that same day and not have to come/ make an appointment or have to go to another imaging center. I was able to get my X-ray but had to make an appointment at another place. It’s not like it used to be when we could get them in the office.<//text>

The office receptionist is so nice as well as very professional and welcoming! The office is peaceful and very clean with ample styles of seating to make anyone comfortable.
The technical staff (x-ray, mri) are amazing! They are highly skilled in their particular fields and very efficient. Your comfort is a priority during your testing and they will work to obtain top quality images while ensuring your safety and comfort.< /Review>

Fat lady in the front was very rude and does not have good communication skills and does not know how to speak.  I see mostly positive reviews but maybe she was in a bad mood or maybe just a disturbed person. I shouldn’t be calling her fat but her attitude was disgusting and I cannot believe she picks and chooses who she wants to be nice to.</Text>

My appointment was on schedule, however, when I arrived, the staff seemed a bit  overwhelmed and almost too busy to handle the number of patients and there was not enough seating in the waiting room.  When I was greeted by the gentleman who did my MRI, he was professional and comforting.< /Text>

I called early in the morning because of a concern about a broken rib. They were able to squeeze me in and confirm there was a fracture.
Definitely recommend this team.<//text>

This imaging center is great. Went in at 10am on a Saturday to have my son get an MRI. The staff up front were nice and Asia the radiology tech was awsome.  She made my son feel comfortable and walked him through the steps. Thank you Asia and everyone here!<//Review>

Great place to come for any of your imaging needs, not to crowded and very clean, staff is real friendly.  I would recommend this image center over the one in Garden Grove any day!< /Text>

<text>They were very professional. I had to pick up my kids from school, and they were able to get me in proptly to avoid me being late. I have also been trying to tackle a kidney problem for several years, and had no luck. Today I had a wonderful ultrasound technician who finally caught something. Now I am on my way to resolve the problem. I was loosing hope and starting to think people didn't believe me. 😢</text></record></dataset><record>
<Text>The staff was lovely! But,  there was something resembling a drop of blood on the coach. I mentioned it. Then after MRI later because waiting room had filled I forgot & sat on it. Luckily Not blood, but sticky red candy on white pants. 😩< /Text><Response>None< /Response><Date>1559576381179<//Date><pics>None<//pics>< user>

<text>The mri Tec was fast and didn’t ask permission to to lift my legs for a bolster resulting in extreme pain. He needs to learn to be more tuned into the person  he’s treating, and a more compassionate person. Right now he’s a “hot shot.”</text><userid>107458363772920049134<//userid><pics>None</pics>< date>

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with friendly and attentive individuals behind the lobby desk. My appointment time was 10:30 and I was escorted right on time by Reggie. He was extremely personable, attentive and responsible.He was able to calm my nerves and I felt I was in good hands. He "walked" me through the procedure so that I would  know what to expect. All in all, an excellent visit surrounded by excellent personnel!<//Review>

Most important thing for me with hospitals and doctors is that they acknowledge that my time is just as important as theirs. I arrived 5 minutes before my appointment time, I was called in at my exact time and was out within an hour. Very professional.<//text>

Very friendly and helpful front office and nursing staff. No long wait time. Dr. Mitchell is awesome and put me on the right track to good health as well as eliminating an issue I have had for some time by immediately ordering exrays, physical therapy and acpossiblr surgeon, if needed for the future. I was very satisfied with my experience at this facility.</Text>

I had a CT scan of both legs done here.
Staff was very friendly, the place was very nice and clean, and the best part is that I was seen on time.  I would definitely recommend Memorial Care Imaging Center.<//text>

I was surprised that I came I on a Wednesday and they wanted to schedule my appointment for the following Monday. Usually if the dr orders tests it’s due to an illness or condition and is time sensitive. Other than that the staff was pleasant  although not overly friendly or concerned. The procedure was scheduled for Friday and only took a few minutes.<//Review>

Reception area comfortable and provides water and maybe coffee. I didn't visit the table and don't recall. Receptionists are friendly. My MRI technician was friendly, I got to wear my own clothes (stretch pants and sweatshirt) because clearly had no metal in them and removed my glasses. I'd come prepared for no metal with no jewelry (or any metal clasped underthings) so after leaving purse in locker could go straight to MRI room. My tech, Asia, was super helpful in alleviating the anxiety about a possible claustrophobic attack, explaining that you go in feet first, get earplugs AND a headset that plays lovely music, AND a squeezy bulb to cling to if you need her.  She warned the machine makes hideous loud noises.  I closed my eyes til close to the end when I opened just one and wished I hadn't for how tight the space was but I was able to stay calm for the few minutes left...15 total for my left side sciatica symptoms.  Was so pleased to come out alive and, even better, without having made a fool of myself!  They handed me a CD of the scan and let me know the Dr. would receive the report within 3 days.  I think that it's because I mentioned, in passing, that I would be seeing her later that afternoon, that they were able, and kind enough, to get it to her before I got to her office 6 hours later.< /Text>

Great place. The office staff was so nice to squeeze my son in for an ultrasound after his doctor appointment so that I didn't have to come back later in the day. The technician was very patient with my crying screaming child. The radiologist was very nice to take time to talk to us.<//Text>

Immediately following referral from Urgent care (same building), when I checked in at imaging center desk; I was advised there was one person in front of me, and approx. 20 minute wait for my exrays opt be taken. At least 10 people were seen before me and was nearly 2 hour wait - totally unacceptable. each time I questioned my status, I received nothing but nonsense responses, from team manning the the appointment desk.
Very poor customer service!< /review>

I am very pleased with my care from my doctor and staff at Memorial Care.  The new facility has everything right there and therefore I didn't have to go several places for the required tests.  The doctor takes his time for my questions and staff is very friendly and seems to care about my wellbeing.  I believe I have found a wonderful group of health care professionals.  Thank you for giving me the chance to share my thoughts about the group.<//Review>

Scheduling the appointment was easy and they got me in right away. Josh called me the night before to confirm and to give me important information about the appointment. Josh was also there in the morning to greet me. He is very friendly and efficient. When it came time for the MRI I was a little stressed out because I am claustrophobic. Aja who performed the procedure was fantastic. She put me at ease. She was very friendly and personable. She explained the procedure which helped me relax by knowing what to expect. She explained that it is a newer machine and that the new machine was a little wider so I didn't feel as confined. She put some headphones on me and played Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon for me. Next thing you know it was over. Have no fears about using this place. It is a first class operation.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Make sure you call your insurance company first! The girls at the front desk will lie to you to get you to have services done that you can not afford.  I set up an appointment and was told I would only have to pay 95.00 then showed up for the appointment and was then told its 475.00.  I said sorry, cant afford this now and was about to leave when they stopped me and said hang on we will make some calls and see why that amount went up.  They assured me not to worry and all i would owe is the 95 but later on i of course got the bill for the difference.  My insurance company said they see this happen often.  Lesson learned, call my insurance first.  Not cool that they lie to patients to trap them into services they can not afford.< /Review></record>

The location is easy to find, the staff is very thorough and courteous/friendly. Wait time for Walk-in was reasonable even with several people waiting. Good experience.</review>

When we arrived, there were 2 people in front of us and yet our wait was 2 hours for a 5 minute xray, people kept coming in and they were called before I was. I was told by the receptionist it was because they had an MRI and an Xray, it really dosen't make any sense to me, maybe it has to do with $$$$?<//Text>

Even the estimated wait time was spot on, within five minutes.</text>

Staff was great, facility was clean and ambiance was nice considering it’s an urgent care. Just gave 4 stars because it took me two hours to get in and out (exam and x ray). Will visit again.< /Text>

Very nice office, Renata (?) That did my ultrasound was very nice. Parking is a little tricky, because you park on the backside of the building but the front door is on Beach Boulevard.< /Review>

I stopped by the checkin desk and ask a women sitting there if they needed anything else from me. There was a man standing behind her that snickered. It may have not had anything to do with me or my question but it made me feel uncomfortable. She then asked me what proceedure i had. I told her but was kind of taken aback as there were a room full of people that could hear me. I would of preferred she just have asked me my name and looked it up. This also made me feel uncomfortable. The tech that did the proceedure was very respectful, thorough & pleasent.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
This place is so disorganized and sloppy.  I tried getting an MRI and it dragged out for months.  The Memorial care call center is a joke and will keep you on the phone forever, like calling the DMV.  Save yourself the hassle and find somewhere else to get your imaging done.< /Review>

Great experience with the actual testing (ultrasound), but it was so difficult to reach the office, sort out insurance, etc. I spoke with multiple people, and it was definitely a frustrating process. I’m glad it’s done.< /Review>

The check in process was very disorganized. There seemed to be more laughing between the staff then checking people in. I was there  almost an hour which is too long for a chest X-ray.</text>
