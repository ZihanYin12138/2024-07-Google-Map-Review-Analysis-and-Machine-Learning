<review>Loved every experience I've had at Emerald! Jen is awesome and great to talk to. She did an awesome job on my tattoo and can't wait to go back to her for me. I did my research for someone who can do Anime and Disney and she definitely did not disappoint 😍❤< /review></record>

<user_id>102355744342962115480<//user_id><review>The staff at Emerald are true angels on Earth! My 8 year old daughter had gotten a piercing somewhere else (claires) that got infected and the earlobe closed over the entire front of the earring. I called Emerald for advice because her pediatrician couldn’t even get it out and it was looking infected. Emerald welcomed us in, looked at it and with some tools and a little work got it out of there!! Sam was so amazing, professional, gentle and kind! They really could have turned us away because they were full of clients, but they had the biggest hearts to take us in and help us when it wasn’t even their mistake! I will always go back here! *Please get your piercings done here with the true professionals and NEVER go to a mall! Thank you Emerald!!!</review>< Gmap_id>

This is the only place I go to for my piercings. I tend to wait for the special Friday the 13th prices though. The employees are really friendly as well. It's just that I haven't gotten a tattoo here yet so I don't know if I love it here yet. Still much better in comparison to In 2 Skin. After coming here, I refuse to go back.<//text>

I definitely will not be returning. I have been coming here for five years getting piercings and tattoos. But today I came in to get a piercing change and the girl managing the desk (Cameron I believe) was rude. I asked to have a piercing change and she told me that she would not replace my piercing unless I chose one of their jewelry’s. I was fine with picking something else. I picked one out and she told me it would be $15. I have always came here to get my piercings changed and never once have I ever had to buy their jewelry and never did it cost $15 to get one replaced, I’ve always brought in my own jewelry and they always replaced it for free. I won’t be supporting a business that employs rude staff. I will also being calling the owner.< /review>

{'time': 1569266054073, 'text': 'Hello Andrea! We are extremely saddened to hear of your experience since you know that is not the norm in our shops. Thank you for your feedback as we do take it very seriously. We do require that in order for us to change out jewelry, that you do have to buy what we have in stock since we can guarantee what the jewelry is made of, that it is cleaned/sterilized properly and how it will fit your particular piercing. The charge was for the jewelry but not the change out. We do not charge our customers for change outs. We generally do not allow our clients to bring in jewelry purchased elsewhere and change it out since it is a liability and we cannot guarantee the jewelry. We can, however, take out the old jewelry for you and you can place your own jewelry in the piercing and our piercers are always happy to help with suggestions of how to change it out. We do hope that since you have been coming to us for so long that you do return as we do love having you in the shop! -Maile'}</Response>

< Review>
Went in for my piercings.....let me just say Samantha is the best person to pierce any part of your body! I had my industrial done and honestly was done within a minute. Painless, efficient, and professional. They are also super clean and hygienic. The guy at the front desk (big mustache) was very courteous and they accommodated a favor on my end to the T! GO TO EMERALDS TO GET YOUR PIERCINGS. That same day I lost a ball to my industrial and they replaced it for free!</Review>

< Review>
Most artist in this shop are capable of being great but are unprofessional. Elf is a good artist but tends to get sloppy towards the end and I’ve heard he puts unwanted men parts in a few peoples tattoo’s . It’s hit and miss with this place</Review>
<pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1594942339445, 'text': "Hello! That is actually a silly rumor being spread around. Unless a client has asked for man parts in their tattoo, they are not just put in unwanted. Elf is a wonderful artist but may not be everyone's cup of tea with his particular style. But we do have many other excellent artists that can take care of you and your tattoo needs since everyone is different. Our artists are well rounded and they love taking care of their clients.

Lodi’s best tattoo and piercing shop. I would never go anywhere else. Their piercer Samantha is the only person I get pierced by. And their tattooers are the only ones I’d get tattooed by. The manager, Galen, is always fun to be around and very helpful.<//Review>

My friend and I came to get our ears pierced here. Our piercer Paige was very sweet and very knowledgeable about all types of various piercings. Her workspace was clean, free of clutter, but still decorative and cool. The piercing itself was very sterile, quick and she made the process as painless as possible!! Prices were reasonable as well. Now I'm the proud owner of two anti-tragus and one conch piercings!!<//text>

I came in for a cover up and I am extremely pleased with the outcome. I was concerned that I would have to settle for a dark tattoo to cover my old tattoo. After going in and talking to George I felt so much better about everything! I mean absolutely everything! I scheduled a consultant and it was awesome the whole experience from start to finish. George took his time during the consultation and actually drew out and showed me how the cover up would work on me. He talked about COLOR!!! Which I was so happy about because I thought I was going to end up with a dark tattoo he told me what would work for my skin color (I'm on the tan side). My tattoo was done in two session and every time I went in I was treated like family. Everyone in the shop is so kind and professional. The owner was there on both occasions and stopped by to say hi which was nice. The shop is very clean and they have so much knowledge about everything. I would highly recommend emerald tattoo.

The guy who did my nose piercing was great even though I was nervous as heck he made me feel comfortable enough to sit through it. I'm thinking about getting a second one & I'll definitely be going back here to him!</Review>

Where do I start. The guy at the front desk was not very friendly and the guy Sam actually did a good job with my lip piercing. But at the end they didn't offer me a Brochure on how to keep the piercing clean and how to watch out for infection and plus they did not have the cleaning solution for the piercing. I tried to find it at a local drug store and at other piercing shops but unfortunately no one had it. So I called Emerald piercing two days later to let them I was having a hard time finding the cleaning solution that they couldn't provide for me the same day I came in for my piercing. And the girl told me she was sorry and couldn't offer me any type of discount for the inconvenience, which I thought was crazy because I came to them for my piercing and they couldn't even provide me with the cleaning solution, plus I was coming from out of town just to go back two days to buy the cleaning solution that they couldn't provide me with do to them running out. So not only did I pay full price for the piercing but I had to turn around and come back two days later just to get the right cleaning solution due to no other piercing shops having it or not finding it at a local drug store smh.. not the best service they could at least offered me a discount for the inconvenience. I will not come to this location no more. They dont even care for their clients.</Review>

<Text>I have always wanted a tattoo, but was really scared and nervous about getting one, I finally decided I was going to do it... I went and talked with Gaylen told him what I was looking for, he put me in contact with Elf, showed him my custom drawing, explained the importance of it, told him it was my 1st time, he put all my worries at ease. I scheduled my appointment...Came in on the day of my appointment, my drawing was completed and he went to work, due to fact of all of the details, it took longer than estimated, but he didnt rush the piece just to finish. Elf has really light hand,and his machine is really quiet, not intimidating or scary at all.
This turned out to be a masterpiece, proud to have it on my body !!!!.
I will be back for more.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

I had heard good things about Emerald Tattoo, so I stopped by one day after work to inquire about having some work done. Oh my goodness.... rude its not the word! The man at the desk was on the phone for several minutes, looking straight at me, but never acknowledging me. Then a man finally comes out of the back, and asks me what I need. I briefly talked to him about it, but the whole time, he was impatient and short with me. Both men had a very condescending air about them, like I was bothering them by being there. I took his card, but as I was walking to my car, I thought to myself... never again will I step foot in there!</text>< pictures>

Went in for a daith piercing and the procedure went well, no pain and very quick. My complaint is that I requested the heart earring and they gave me the hoop, the guy doing the piercing told me that they would instruct me on the care and cleaning up front but received no information. I would use them again but next time make sure they hear me.<//Review>

I've been to Emerald on several different occasions for piercings and every time, even with different piercers they have been gentle, personable, clean, and fair priced. I have gotten my Nose (done 3 months ago by the expert Mitch), Helix, and Tragus (most recently by the MAGNIFICENT Tegan!) and they have all healed beautifully without infection and the other staff has always been amazing with consultations and after care! I will absolutely only go to Emerald for piercings from now on! Keep up the incredible work! :D</text>

Had my USMC  tattoo updated a couple years back and they did a great job. I went in tonight because they said they were open until 9am. When I got there and told them I wanted to get a wedding tattoo they began to start the excuses. They said that they didn't have enough time and they don't close until 9am. Current staff is a bunch of liars.<//text>

I did extensive research on this establishment and there was no policy stating that making a deposit was un refundable but was solely to secure my spot. I made an appointment and I called back seconds later to cancel because something came up and I couldn't make it, so I just wanted my money back. The manager then came on the phone and made false promises and lied because there was no mention of a no refund policy, basically he told me call back on Monday because he cant make refunds during the weekend. I call back Monday, he switched up on me and was extremely rude.<//text>

Ive gotten a side tatt and a piercing at Lodi Emerald in the past. Good place for clean and safe tatts or piercings. Their staff is pretty cool, comfy chairs and  better prices than other places in Tracy or Modesto.<//review>

<Text>I normally do not write reviews but after my traumatizing experience at Emerald Tattoo .,... I went in to get a Daith (im not sure exactly what its called) piercing , and I explained , as well as pointed to the diagram they have in the store of all the places they pierce, to the girl at the front , where EXACTLY i wanted my piercing. I have had plenty of piercings in the past but as I was getting pierced it hurt so damn bad I asked her to stop . She seemed like she was having a difficult time finding where to exit the piercing. So i bled really bad for a while. So bad I didnt remove my cotton till the next day , my ear hurt so bad, still does and i realized it wasnt hurting where I wanted it pierced. So basically , if you are looking for miscommunication and piercing in the wrong spot emerald tattoo is where you should go< /Text></record>

I don't normally do reviews but this place is great and the staff is amazing.  They are very friendly and know their stuff! I've done 2 daith piercings there one by Paige and the 2nd by I think her name is Sammi. (If not my apologies!)  But they were both great and made me feel comfortable thru the process. Dale is amazing up front. Also very knowledgeable and helpful. I will def. Be coming back. You guys rock!< /text>

The guys at EMERALDTATTOO are some of the coolest guys ever. They've got no problem working with whatever budget you have. I am a volunteer firefighter and I brought 4 of my fellow firefighters in and they fit us all in on one day. They have one of cleanest shops I've ever seen. And I've gone to all the other shops in Lodi. And unlike some tattoo shops they will make sure that even if they don't like your tattoos they will do your tattoo to the best of their ability. Surly they are best in Lodi area, Recommended!< /Text>

Hires unfriendly and unprofessional staff. Tons of artists can tattoo as well if not better than these guys for the same price-- maybe lower. Raise your standards, don't get tattoos from them.< /text>

If you haven't been you've got to go! I've gone with others and also by myself and each time I've had an amazing experience. If they had a monthly membership I'd be all over it. GO FOR IT! You only live once and you'll be glad you went!<//text>

Friendly staff and fun times here ! They have a bar in the back so you can refill your wine/beer while you paint. Great atmosphere and they provided good instructions. Lots of fun! It's nice that it's in a mall so that you have an option to walk around the mall afterwards :) it's an outdoor mall.< /Text>

Been here for at least half a dozen paint & wine nights. The instructors here are all awesome, helpful and funny! I love when they do the black light paint nights. They're so fun, especially around Halloween! They keep their tools super nice and clean. Never had a bad experience here!< /Review>

Had a team building event for work here and it was a lot of fun. They have beer too, despite the name.

Try it out. I would recommend to a friend.<//text>

The painting instruction is on point.  The bar is served well.  The bathrooms are clean, but one has a janky lock so be careful.  Eat before you come for your lesson, the timing is exactly what they say it is, you will not leave early.  There's a group picture at the end so don't get sloshed.< /text>

<review>There is nothing I can type that can convey the awesomeness of the Pinot's Palette - Tustin. Just do yourself a favor - sign up for the newsletter, enroll in a class, book a private party there, do something, anything to interact with this space and these people. Your life will be richer for it. And all your DIY projects will make you happy.

(P.S. Looking for ideas for a rad company offsite? Talk to Kelly and have her set something up for you like silk screening. It'll be more fun than a barrel of monkeys.)</review><Name>John Hernandez<//Name><date>1555753128127< /date><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

We went to the Japanese Spring class on Saturday! The hubby is not an artist and has not painted since early grade school. I have been an artist since grade school, had an emphasis on commercial art in high school, and have an AA in Advertising Graphic Design. I wanted to see how our different levels of art would transform on a canvas. Even though the hubby thought his tree would end up looking like a stick figure, his painting was pretty good for someone who had not picked up a paint brush in over 35 years (other than painting the inside and outside of a house). My painting turned out pretty good, especially since I had not worked in acrylic paint since Jr. High.

They have a bar where you can order up some wine and non-alcoholic drinks. This is great for a date night, girl's night out, birthdays, and just friendly get-togethers. The music selection was also great too! I was dancing in my seat while painting.</review>

What a fun place! It was our first time ever doing anything like this even though I have heard how fun these painting party company's can be with friends. We drank wine and actually learned how to paint and I loved what I painted so much ,I actually hung it on the wall when I got home. Friendly staff, meet the owners and they were very nice. The artist and helper artist explained things very well, even though it was easier to just copy what he was doing. I recommend Pinot Palette to even those who don't think they can paint. Fun time, great entertainment for the money.< /text>

One of the best placed to eat for me besides others. Food is healthy and everything is made withing the kitchen, from the sauce to the food, no preservatives as I know of so far, not even the egg come in a carton box but in their shells. Though I miss eating inside, the only problem I have recently is the phone, when I try to make an order, sometime it doesn't work and takes me straight to the message machine, but still a 5 🌟 for me. Why? Stuff is nice and makes you fell welcome. Before the pandemic is was the best place to eat 2 or 3 times per week inside the restaurant, and I live in Los Angeles, not in Oxnard.👍👍</Review>

Servers were very friendly. Food came out fast and hot. The BLTA had bacon that was hanging off the bread and thick cut, while the avocado was perfectly ripe. Would definitely recommend this place.<//text>

<Text>This is a great breakfast spot. I come here when I'm in town. The service is either really good or bad.

The food here is really good. I would stuck with the basics, though. Don't order the corned beef and hash. It's from a can. Gross! The coffee is bland. Nothing special.

Now, on to the good items. The Avocado omellete is awesome. The chicken fried steak is good.

This is a local hangout.< /Text>< pics>

The food was SO delicious!! And the service there was completely amazing, it felt like I was family and we were having a family breakfast on Saturday morning. The atmosphere there is very warm and inviting. It truly is a very amazing place to grab a bite to eat, the price's do seem a bit high until you realise how MUCH food you get. I highly recommend BG's Cafe as they have a nice selection of breakfast and lunch with fair prices and very generous portions along with their amazing staff. To top it off the food is ALWAYS cooked to perfection. Trust me you will NOT regret going here!! 15/10<//review>

This location is one of my favorites. It has a nice atmosphere. Makes me feel like I am back in Sacramento. Everyone at our table was enjoying everything. I had a brother come into town and he asked me to go back here. Bring your hunger - portions are generous. Feeling here is similar to a place in Columbus I liked.< /text>

Got the Half Turkey Sandwich with fries and it was tasty but wish it had more meat. I added avocado. As you can tell, it had mostly lettuce. I gave it 4 stars because the other people I went with got different plates and they were well portioned. If it was just myself with my lonely sandwich,  I would have given them 3 stars.<//text>

I can expect quality Mediterranean food if I decide to come here. We had a large party and luckily the wait wasn't too bad.

This has been our favorite breakfast place in Oxnard.  The food is great and the staff friendly.  This has been the only restaurant we have returned to regularly during our 3 month stay in Oxnard and it will be greatly missed by us.  Our favorites were the super reuben, breakfast enchiladas, and pretty much anything off the Mexican breakfast area of the menu.  You really cannot go wrong. :)</review>

<text>Excellent place for breakfast, brunch or if you want breakfast for lunch. They have a pretty large menu, so I recommend getting a general idea of what you want before you show up if you are somewhat indecisive like me.</text></record>

First time here, and we had a pretty long wait, but expected it on a Sunday morning. The food was pretty good, not reinventing the wheel. Our server seemed to be one of the only ones who cared. We watched some of the other servers leave food sitting in the window a long time, just glad it wasn't ours. Middle of the road at best.< /Text>

Their pancakes can be a lil undercooked at times & oj may be freshly squeezed but it can be a lil warm (maybe they should chill their oranges) but i like their biscuits & gravy.</text>

The were busy on a Sunday afternoon but we didn't wait long for a table.  Food was fantastic!  I had the Chorizo Omelet and my wife had the breakfast croissant sandwich, both very good!  Also got a side order of 2 chocolate chip pancakes that were delicious!  We'll be back for sure!</Review>

<Text>“Upscale burgers, casual dining”
Hook Burgers are in the same restaurant family as The Habit, which is another great place. Hook has beer and wine (no happy hour), but prices are very reasonable still. We usually share a burger and a salad, and were more than satisfied when we left. The patio outside is great because we can bring the canines and eat there....</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

My family and I were on vacation and we randomly pick restaurants off of google to see if we will ever visit while on vacation next time. We had excellent service! The food was over the top good. I had the huevos a la mexicana. My wife had the apple French toast. We could eat there all day!</review>

I was very impressed with their food selection and service. Only complaint it was super hot but the owner said he was going to be fixing that.

Prices were very reasonable and serving sizes were ample. I got the corned beef hash and it was a delicious will definitely go back and try their other items.< /Text>

<Review>Always try to visit BG's cafe while in California, the staff is always very friendly, the cinnamon roles are very good as well as the breakfast!  Order cinnamon rolls first, they run out!  We try a variety of things on the breakfast menu, everything is really good.  I usually get the Chilaquiles and it hits the spot.  We usually just go for breakfast but next time will try out the lunch menu.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This place was about 90% full and they still made us wait 5 minutes for a table.  The busboy was very friendly but we didn't see our waitress much.  The food was good, but not enough to make my kids feel like they HAD to come back any time soon.  It then took a while to get our check and to get my credit card back.  If you like the old fashioned breakfast, it's a great place to eat.  I got the eggs Benedict with avocado and was really impressed with the ham... especially because I don't really like ham.  The busboy told us that the pancakes are really popular, which my kids ordered, but they didn't feel the pancakes were any different than most pancakes.  It's a bit out of the way but it's decent for breakfast fare.</review>

Loved this place! My husband and I split one of the scrambles and it was plenty for both of us. Cost us 10 bucks! Can't go wrong with that! Not to mention delicious! It came with homefries and a biscuit as well. Huge menu of other reasonably priced items as well. Our server was also very pleasant and helpful. Very enjoyable experience.</Text>

We went here for breakfast. It was busy, an apparent favorite of the locals. When you walk in you know you have come to a good place for breakfast.<//text>

Visiting with my family in the area. Great breakfast. Coffee was fresh and brewed rich. Got an omelet made to order. My wife said the Huevos Rancheros was the best she's had in a long time. The cinnamon rolls are fantastic. It's better then Cracker Barrel and cheaper then Denny's. If we're back in Oxnard we're coming back.< /text>

Typical, casual diner. Went for breakfast, big portions. Not fancy by any means, but the menu had a lot of variety. Suggestion: get the cinnamon roll.< /Review>

Fantastic local eatery with a deep menu and personable service.  This place is a well-kept secret, started in 1971 and handed over to other owners in 2005; my wife and I have been locals since 1993 and just had our first of what I am sure are to be many satisfying experiences with BG's Cafe.< /text>

This restaurant has a great family atmosphere. There are regular customers in there frequently that are always friendly.

The food is delicious, cooked to your specific request, and is served in a timely manner. I love this restaurant because it is tucked away in downtown Oxnard and is rarely overcrowded.</Review>

Ate there today, chicken fingers were delivered on a bed of lettuce that was wilted and looked like it came out of a trash bin (something that you would definitely toss). The other meal was eggs over medium that were so hard that you couldn't even cut it was a knife and the toast was burned black. I won't be going back< /review>

Great food. Chicken fried steak was crispy and delicious and my grilfriend raved about the cornbeef hash. We go to a lot of restraraunts and this is definitely in my top three. Comfortable and plenty of parking we go out of our way to eat here. You will love it.</review>

Bg's is nice, friendly place.  The food is above average.  Coffee is quite good.  Veronica the owner is super nice.  However, I have eaten here on a couple of weekends recently, and they have gotten very busy.  This is good for Veronica, applause please.  The trouble is, when BG's get so busy, they get really, really slow.  I mean slow.  It took a while to order, then a wait of about 25 to 25 minutes to receive breakfast.  The holdup appeared to be in the kitchen, they could not keep up.  They could take some lessons from other breakfast places and speed the kitchen up.  Then all will be well.< /review>

<Review>One of my favorite breakfast spots, have not tried their lunch yet! Chilaquiles highly recommended, one of the best! Bring your own milk though ha ha, one glass of milk cost you$5.75, with that money I can buy 2 gallons of milk at the store! Other than that highly recommended. And huevos rancheros deluxe are off the chart. Best spot in down town oxnard.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>The coffee was too watery,we asked if we could get stronger coffee, the waitress said,no we make it like this
We waited long to get our orders,then had to ask for our foods
It was not that full at all,this place can use a good cleaning too
Food was good but looking how the establishment was I couldn't finish my food</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Chilaquiles and Eggs ($8.50) is crispy tortilla strips tossed with onion and tomato, topped with red salsa and cheese, served with sour cream and your choice of either home fries, hash browns, refried beans, sliced tomatoes, cottage cheese, or fresh fruit. It also comes with your choice of toast, English muffin, buttermilk biscuit, or tortillas. These are one of the best chilaquiles you'll ever have. Since they use their award-winning salsa, the tortilla strips absorb the flavors of the tomatoes, onions, and spices. It has a slightly spicy kick but is not overwhelming. The sour cream adds a creamy cooling quality to finish it off. Rating: 4.5/5

One Biscuit and Country Gravy ($3) is really a meal in itself. The homemade buttermilk biscuits are gigante! They are light and fluffy and you can tell that they are freshly baked that morning. The gravy has a great peppery sausage flavor with a creamy texture. Rating: 4.9/5

Avocado Eggs Benedict ($12) is two poached eggs on grilled English muffins with grilled tomatoes, two slices of ham, and topped with creamy hollandaise sauce and sliced avocado. The creamy hollandaise works excellently with the buttery avocado. The thick-sliced ham adds a meaty texture and saltiness to the dish. The perfectly poached eggs have flowing liquid gold yolks and the tomato adds a hint of sweetness. Rating: 4.5/5

Chile Verde Omelet (look for this as a special) is beautifully made with tender pork chunks in a slight spicy chile verde sauce. The cheese is gooey inside and also melted on top. It is a wonderful fusion of an American style omelet with Mexican flavors. Rating: 4.4/5< /Text>< name>

Food came 30 minutes late, Eggs Benedict with sausage was good, the Nopalito scramble was overwhelming with very little egg. Ok breakfast.<//Review>

<time>1531329009432< /time><Review>(Translated by Google) The food tastes good
But having to wait half an hour for your cold food to be brought
ask for french toast and they bring you
Pancakes order some eggs over hard
And they give you over medium, those sizes are what
that make me think that the problem is the waitress, not the place
Finally he forgot to bring us the sauce

(Original)
Tiene buen sabor la comida
Pero tener que esperar media hora para que traigan tu comida fría
que pidas french toast y te traigan
Pancakes pidas unos huevos over hard
Y te los den over medium esos de talles son los que
que me hacen pensar que el problema es la mesera no el lugar
Por último se le olvidó traernos la salsa</Review><Rating>3</Rating><user>104168990975550958641</user>< Gmap_id>

<review>Very friendly service, super convenient. All work done while you wait in your car (waiting room also available.) And you won't wait long! They're called Express Lube for a reason. We've been coming here for several years now and we'll never go back to the other guys. Try Express Lube, you won't regret it! 👍👍<//review>< Pictures>

Went here for the first time, super happy definitely going back! They changed my oil, checked and changed my air filter, and let me know about the transmission fluid all within 10-15 minutes and I was out the door. Super fast, professional and very nice/easy going. Why would I go anywhere else!?< /review>

<Text>This place was always my go to place because they were quick, prices were good, and they were professional at what they were doing. Until I went to get my oil change at my buddies work place honda. He told me that who ever did my oil change did a poor job. The oil plug and the oil filter was not secure tightly. He told me that it was loose and most likely they just twisted by hand only. Also the oil filter that was on my car was very old and bad. I was upset with the news and I'm glad I was informed of the quality work they did with my car. I'm never going back again. People be warn of this place. If you want a good quality work, go to another place or do it yourself.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
I needed a transmission flush for my vehicle and I called around Fresno and everyone wanted $260 and they needed a three and a half hours with it. I took it to Express Lube and they told me $139 and they did it in about 40 minutes. I highly recommend this place they don't jog you around and tire you with lies. I actually had a shop tell me that they had to remove the filter and put in a new one. You can't it doesn't have one. I highly recommend them.</Review>

I went to get some work done on two of my cars at once. Service was excellent! They cleaned my dirty window. They show me the color of my fluid  of before and after. They work as a team to get me in and out as soon as possible. I bough my own oil and filter and it was welcome and was charge for labor only. Got a 5 dollar manager discount. I left about $25 tips for going above and beyond service. Not much but hopefully they can grab pizza for the hard working crews.</Review>

Best oil change experience I've ever had! They charged exactly what they estimated, they fixed problems with my car that had been caused by a different oil change company, and even inflated my spare tire, all without me needing to ask them. They were nice and very fast. I will always go here from now on!</Text>

Great service, very fast, affordable, friendly staff. Nothing bad to say about the people or service. The location isn't in the best part of town, but I've been going there for a few years and haven't had trouble.</text>

Sighhh.

Military Discount?
I got mine- but I definitely asked for it.
My bill would have been $64.99 but instead came out to $59.43

Soo Express Service? Yes.
I was in and out in 10 minutes.

Customer Service friendly?
Even though I was greeted and told thank you and have a happy holiday- I didn’t get the warm and fuzzy energy that you normally would receive from these type of places. Their energy was very dry as if I wasn’t wanted there.

The older gentleman with the Hazel eyes was cool but the bigger guy who looked like Gabriel Iglesias was very non-chalant and didn’t address me when it was time to pay- he just shouted out a price 🙄. I asked him was he speaking to me? He replied yes of course - if he said that any dryer I would have had to pass his personality some water to help swallow his attitude.

Would I be back?
Probably not

Would I recommend this place to someone else?
If based on the quick service - yes.

If based upon their attitude - Not at all.</Text>

I had my high school kids change my oil- they wound up whacking the drain plug and somehow loosened the oil pan and caused it to start leaking. They bought all the tools and buckets and stuff, but somehow they made a mess on the driveway and everything they touched. DIY ain't all it used to be...

I went to the guys at Xpress and told them what happened- they took care of the bad plug, tightened the pan back up and did the lube and rest of the service- No upcharge for the extra stuff my kids messed up.
The price was less than the oil, filter, and other stuff to do it ourselves.
Whenever I pay someone to do the work, it will always be these guys!  Thanks!< /text>

<review>I gave 5 stars, but as a feedback, 5th protein needs to be the same portion as the 1st protein! However, it was the tastiest poke bowl I’ve had. I ordered a large and boy was it good with a hefty portion! I highly recommend this place over poke chop if you want your money’s worth for real. I’ll continue to order from this restaurant as long as they don’t downplay their customers like some other restaurants! Great example of how restaurants should operate despite the pandemic- serving great quality meals!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I go there weekly. I like that they include one scoop of avocado while most poke places charge for it. It always taste great. The big bowl includes 5 scoops of protein so it feeds easily my kids and I.<//text>

<Review>I ordered food from here and it was still nice and fresh when it arrived. The bowl looked small, but was actually quite large and filling. They are pricey but include a lot of great toppings for free and come with 3 choices of protein (huge scoops). Worthwhile for a quick poke bowl.</Review><GmapID>0x80d95516a97d8d99:0x64712fbc0ef55e8b< /GmapID>< resp>

<pics>None<//pics><review>Very expensive for less than decent quality. The shrimp in specific, avocado and vegetables that are added as sides etc, are mostly not fresh! The Avocado on my dish was almost black as if it has been there for a few days. Not to mention that the biggest issue I had with this place was the portion of serving the bowls. I ordered a medium and expected to get the amount I paid for but instead I was ripped off. I barely even had an inch of rice on my bowl and barely had enough sauce to even taste the product. I realized that the lady that helped me was stingy about serving! This happened  at 4:00pm on Tuesday August 11th 2020. I don’t think I will be coming back here because I am being ripped off. I wish I could get a refund because I am putting my life at risk with eating somewhere where the stuff is not clean nor fresh. I’ve been to other poke places and by far this one is my least favorite. So people please don’t waste your time & money going to this place.</review><Name>tthinktinker bell</Name>< resp>

This is easily my second favorite poke spot in San Diego. If you're reading this, don't be surprised if it's your first favorite. They keep everything very clean and cover the protein which pretty much no one else does. I love this. The rice tastes amazing too and the employees are amazing and so friendly. I tell all of my friends about this place and family too.<//Text>

<text>Unbelievably awful service. I ordered online. Order wasn't ready (or even started by the time i got there) even though i showed up after the time i was told to be there.

AND THEN they royally messed up my order. I mean one of the poke bowls is not even close to the order.

My partner won't even eat his bowl.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Drinks always take forever , as they serve all the poke bowls they charge you  and continue to make more bowls and after the line goes down they make the drinks last :/ kinda annoying :P but food and drinks is good . Just been super slow on many occasions.</Review>

This is my #1 poke spot! Super close to my house and I always felt the price was a little cheaper than the competitors, and the employees don’t skimp on what they give you. If I could afford to go here everyday, I so would.< /review>

First time in the restaurant, I've always ordered delivery from another location and have always been satisfied.

Shaylene greeted me, washed her hands and helped me right away. She did not rush me, she had a smile the entire time and was just pleasant all around.

The establishment was clean. The 3 employees I saw looked happy. There were 2 other customers at tables and the employees kept themselves busy. The fish is fresh, sauces are very tasty. I am yelping more for the customer service I received. I will absolutely return anytime I'm craving poke.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Interesting reading that some people say the size of their protein scoops are small. I find it just the opposite. They are way more generous than other places that are so exacting on their scoops. Not only that, but they have more selections and are the only place to have two spicy proteins. They also have better toppings and I like that it's more casual than the other places, which seem too pretentious for me. The Poke Co. is the only one that we go back to again and again.< /text>< Time>

Not as bad as some made it sound. AC was on but not blasting. However protein items are in their own sealed case so not sure why that matters? Rice was nice and fluffy, spicy salmon was tasty with more of a kick than expected, and no issue with the ginger or edamame. Staff was nice at first but a large line formed behind so they started speeding things up. I do feel there are other spots were you get more for your money but this isn't a bad choice.</review>

<text>Don’t let the reviews on here fool you, check yelp if you need to. Poke Co is awesome and is my go to for poke. The fish always tastes fresh and they have a wide variety of toppings (they need fresh Serrano or jalapeño IMO). The portions are pretty generous and the workers are usually friendly (there’s one girl who was rude to me but maybe she was having a rough day). If you’re questioning going here the answer is yes.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Your representative, Ria M., went to great effort to make sure I was happy with the color, and even exchanged the shades when I thought they were a poor match with the previous shade I had ordered 2 years prior. They are a wonderful addition to my office and I couldn't be happier!</review>

Great service from start to finish. Ria (sales rep) walked us through the entire process, explained everything, came back and mapped out all the color and fabric with our designer and gave us a 2 week lead time. Within 8 days of the order the blinds were installed and done perfect with no messes. We love the blinds we selected for our office.<//Text>

<review>All aspects of replacing our window coverings were top notch.  Dani in sales steered us in the right direction, and recognized nuances that we hadn't thought about.  Ray, from the installation team also had a few suggestions to make the project succesful..  5-Star service is what we wanted, and that's what we received.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>The experience I had with 3-Day Blinds was exceptional from the first meeting with the representative/designer,  to the installation.  Effortless on my part.  Each step of the process went smoothly and the final products met my expectations.  This was my first encounter with 3-Day Blinds and will certainly not be my last.<//Review><gmapID>0x808560b9a67ab38f:0x296b1c9e07ba3820</gmapID></record>

Exceptional experience at all three key points:
1.  Easy to schedule appointment via web
2.  In home consultant was experienced and didn’t push on costlier options.  Listened to my needs and provided good solutions.
3.  Installer was on time and extremely efficient.

Both design consultant and installer were professional and personable.

My blinds look great and I am very happy with the product, the process and the people.< /Text>

Great experience from start to finish. The original appointment with the designer was excellent - he arrived on time, was very knowledgeable and helpful, and responded to my follow-up emails quickly and pleasantly. I would have appreciate communication on the day of installation to let me know when to expect the installer because he didn't arrive until the very last minute of the 3 hour window, but installation was quick and super easy once he arrived. I'm very happy with the final product and would recommend 3 Day Blinds to others.<//Review>

<Review>I had 3-Day Blinds put the new blinds in my remodeled house.  The design consultant, Alex Hunter (San Diego area), did a great job of providing exactly what I wanted.  He also did good follow-up.  Ricardo delivered and installed my blinds, and did a expert job.  He paid great attention to detail, and made the blinds look exactly how I wanted them.  This is the 4th time I've used 3-Day Blinds, and they always come through for me.  They cost a little more than some, but you get quick delivery and expert installation, as well as a good product and convenient in-home ordering with expert measuring.<//Review>< pics>

Great place to grab a drink on Friday nights. Please drink very responsibly, and never drink and drive. It will be costing you an arm and a leg for insurance, registrations, driver’s license, and the car you purchased years ago. Thank you.<//Review>

Was here Christmas eve.  The normal place I go when I spend the Holiday with family treated me about as rude as one can. Didn't know this place existed and was much friendlier and also better priced for what I drink.  Owner was extremely pleasant< /text>

Poster Bar for "hole in the wall". Drinks are fair, price is good. It would appear it's a revolving door of locals who are seemingly welcoming. There is an old guy at the end of the bar who looks like he's been here for.... A long time. He might be dead. I don't know. Insults are flying, people are laughing. Cheers to this tiny bar.< /text>

<text>Before training at Effective I had a very negative association with gyms and working out. As soon as I met the owner and team members I knew this place was different. I am now trained at a level that challenges me, but doesn't overwhelm me or make me feel anxious. I've been able to see myself grow and get stronger both physically and mentally. I am so thankful I joined this community, it is truly unlike any other gym.< /text>< Resp>

After 2 months I was completely pain free in my back and tailbone and 90% on my knees. Fast forward 2 years later and I'm still pain free. I'm stronger than I've ever been before. I'm so appreciative of their knowledge and experience of what my body could handle and what it needed to heal. With the nutrition plan and coaching it has really changed my life.

For about 6 months I have been working out at Effective Fitness. I've lost a ton of inches and have gotten so much stronger and healthier. I love the trainers and the people I see 4 days a week, but the mental clarity it gives me, is by far the best part.

When I took on this journey I had no idea how amazing the timing would actually be for myself. It's like God said, "Girl, go do you for a bit."

It's a huge sign where I need to be, when my back hurts from stress when I walk to my car, but it releases the moment I walk through the gym doors.

I encourage you to try it out!!

You deserve it, just like I do.</review>

I'm so grateful for this gym and the structure of the programs that they create for each individual. I love that it is personalized to me and my ability and how my body moves. It has drastically helped me and I'm so proud of myself for finally becoming a consistent gym goer! It's because I actually enjoy it here. The coaches are so knowledgeable and give me the right amount of push and encouragement every time. I've had major results in my body, energy levels, and confidence. It has truly changed my life.< /Review>

Life changing!! When I first started working out at Effective Fitness I could barely lift 5 pound weights; yet alone bend over to touch my toes. NOW, I'm pressing 25 pound weights and can easily touch my toes. I'm a much STRONGER (ME) because of the training and workout sessions at Effective Fitness. Amazing transformations and support systems in place to help you achieve your health and fitness goals. Great synergy and so much more!!!<//Text>

I'm not sure where to begin with how much Effective Fitness and the team has done for me the last 8 months. I came in here after years of not being active, having a child, and working an office position. I could not even ride the bike for 30 seconds without wanting to vomit and getting a headache. I also did not know the correct nutrition. Effective Fitness has it all, I only wish I had found them sooner. Ashley, Chris, Mo, Christine and the ever growing team are amazing. I can now ride the bike with ease after a long workout, I can lift weights, my strength and endurance has increased 10 fold. They have become my family; the EF team as well as the members. Thank you for guiding me through this rough patch (that lasted 8 years), and making me stronger physically, mentally, and emotionally. I look forward to my continued growth. You have taught my whole family health.l, including my 6 year old. Thank you from the bottom of my heart !!!<//Review>

<date>1520304900937< /date><username>Kristi Kass<//username><Review>This little gym is such a treasure. My goal when I signed up was to get back my strength and stability after having my ACL reconstructed. I did PT for 9 months prior but didn’t feel it was helping me fine tune my knee to be ready for the soccer field again. After I completed the 6week program with Ashley (owner), to my surprise, I was stronger, more stable and just as important, more confident in my knee. I feel ready to get back in the game. Not only can the trainers at this gym, successfully help you reach your goals but their knowledge base of exercises and nutrition is impressive, their attitudes are seriously always positive and supportive and patient (endless amounts of patience, coming from someone whose a bit stubborn, this was unexpected but so appreciated), and they truly believe in you, even when you don’t believe in yourself. The trainers have created quite the unique, supportive and successful training environment. I respect and admire this place to no end. If you try one of their programs, I promise you will walk away, changed.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<pictures>None<//pictures><review>I have ALWAYS struggled with maintaining a healthy lifestyle until I started working out here! This was the FIRST time in my life I've been able to commit to working out consistently in my life. I started out going 3 days a week and after about 6 months or so worked my way up to 4-5 days a week. Not only are the trainers friendly, kind, and motivating, but they are so good at breaking things down to simplify them for you. They get to the root of your struggle with food and don't totally overwhelm you, but make it a manageable and smooth transition. I was super consistent for about a year and a half right up until I delivered my baby. They are so great at catering to whatever level you are at. I loved that this encompassed everything from mindset, working out, body image, and a food plan. They really know what they are doing, and truly care about helping others better their lives! Definitely a must try!<//review>< Response>

I don't always give out 5 STARS, but when I do, it's always for the best people... Chris, Ashely, Kristine, Britney and Mo. A HUGE thank you for your expertise, guidance, attention, encouragement and overall dedication to helping me become a better person, physically and mentally. EF is an extremely friendly and welcoming atmosphere, where no one is made to feel out of place. Their custom designed workouts focus on what you want and help you achieve your goals. I just passed my 2 year mark, and have no plans of leaving!</Text>

The trainers here are amazing and the sense of community definitely helps for staying consistent and getting the most out of the workouts. After working with a lot of different trainers, these are some of the most knowledgeable I've ever had the pleasure of learning from. The nutritional support makes a huge difference and the way they help with day to day, natural habit progression has been so eye opening for way more than just health/fitness. Life changing!< /review>

Effective Fitness is an all around great gym. The trainers are top notch, always there, and extremely knowledgeable. Safety and physical health are number one priority. Each staff member is always checking for injuries or soreness. They have all the right equipment and all the right routines.  Ashley also gave us all an amazing meal plan with recipes and information on the importance of proper nutrition.</Review>

I have been going to Effective fitness for 3 years now. I have been working one on one with Chris. He is very knowledgeable about dieting and workout plans that conform to your goals. The breakdown in cost on one on one training is to no comparison with any other one on one training out there. When I started here, I had about 2 years experience with lifting weights, but I had no mobility. Chris worked very closely to help me train my body to become mobile and correct my posture. Once we accomplished that, it was a matter of months before I was lifting 50% more weight. This has been a game charger for reaching my goals. I am very happy with my decision to choose Effective Fitness for private coaching. I am forever grateful. 👊🏻</text>

<date>1490553823664< /date><Rating>5</Rating><text>I am so happy I found Effective Fitness. It changed my life. I was a newer mom wasting time repeating the same exercises, pretending to burn calories on an elliptical and lifting minimal weights. Effective Fitness taught me a better way to workout that gave me results and saved time. You can join group classes or follow personalized programs. The trainers and owners are smart and care about your progress. They place emphasis on warmups, nutrition, muscle confusion, circuit training, escalated density programs and modify around existing limitations and injuries.
Enrollment is for everyone. I saw teenagers learning to lift properly, high school athletes, professional competitors, new moms, young professionals, middle age women and even retirement age members. You form acquaintances and friendships with these members and these connections keep you accountable. I got back in shape and then baby #2 was on her way. I didn't skip a beat, I worked out my entire pregnancy and got back into shape so much faster after she was born.
Unfortunately, the military has taken me elsewhere, but they are still helping me out with online programs and checking with me over the phone. Thank you Effective Fitness for making me stronger and feel good about myself.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>This place is amazing, they were able to create a customized program that fit around my shoulder injury (torn labrum). I was going to take the surgery route for my shoulder which I was not happy about until I found this amazing place. The Effective Fitness team was able to help me regain my strength and range of motion in my shoulder. My favorite part of this place is that they are able to customize things for you, offer alternatives, and still help you get fit.</Text><Date>1520629630633< /Date>< Rating>

I have been going here for the past 8 months, and have seen huge changes in my strength, stamina and endurance! I have never been one to go to a gym because I could never stick to it...but Effective  Fitness is different. I feels like a community. It feels like you actually are supported and your goals are a priority. It addresses whole body wellness and health. The trainers care so much about each client and keep you accountable! What started as just a "trial few months" that I was sure I wouldn't continue has lead into me actually getting excited to get up and head to the gym every morning!! This is unlike any gym I've ever seen and if you truly do want to see results in your body, this is the place to make it happen!!!</Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>THIS PLACE CHANGES LIVES ... Two months ago I realized i needed to take my life back and get back into shape. I was a athlete my whole life playing baseball at all levels but when I blew my knees out and set home I was discouraged. Ten years later I went on a search for a place that would be able to walk with me in getting back my life and EFFECTIVE FITNESS was the place. They did a assessment and then Designed a Personal program for my needs which was also to strengthen my knees.

The trainers here are amazing and encouraging and really care about your life and helping you become healthier. This place is one for every person from people who want to get healthy, lose weight and sports athletes who want to get to the next level. They have a program for all.

Chris, Ashley, Mo and Christine thank you guys for changing my life and effective fitness for life.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><date>1520101416119< /date>< user>

<text>Effective Fitness has changed my life. I’ve tried so many different programs and none of them have worked for me the way EF has. I am the leanest, strongest and most toned all over that I have ever been. I finally feel comfortable in my own skin. The trainers are all amazing - Ashley, Chris, Christine, Brittany and Mo. They are all so genuine, personable and knowledgeable. They make you feel comfortable but also push you so that you can reach your goals. I highly recommend EF, they will change your life too!<//text>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Effective Fitness is a great place with a very positive environment to workout in. I am an 17 yr old athlete with a back injury and the trainers here do a great job of working around my injury while building muscle in exercises geared directly to my sport. The personalized workouts and group training has allowed me to gain strength in areas I want to and protect my body from any further injuries!!!</text>< Pics>

Life changing. It might sound crazy but I started working out here knowing I wasn’t going to stick with it like every other time I’ve started a work out program over the past 10 years. Seems there’s always an injury involved and plenty of excuses. Well here I am 8 months later, still working out 4 days a week with these amazing coaches and I truly look forward to starting my day with them. I’m seeing physical changes that I didn’t know were possible at my age. Old aches and pains are gone and I’m STRONG! I couldn’t / wouldn’t do this without Chris and Ashley and the amazing program they personalize just for me, working around old injuries etc. Best thing I’ve ever done for myself.< /text>

Doggie Daycare And More takes really good care of the furry family members.   They run free and not stuck in kennels.  My Sophie was happy and did not want to go home.  I highly recommend you leaving your pet in their care.<//review>

After a failed attempt at daycare with a “ big chain” dog daycare facility I found Doggie Daycare in Costa Mesa. Such an amazing difference.  There were toys and beds in the playroom  and the staff was very attentive to the dogs.  At Doggie  daycare our dog’s tail was up the whole time! It was apparent I the video stream the dogs were comfortable and happy. (Opposite of experience at the big chain where the dogs had no toys or beds and simply paced and kept their tails down.) The video quality here is great! This is a top run facility that really cares about its guests. We will be using Doggie Daycare every time we are visiting SoCal.< /review>

The staff was so attentive to my dogs first day! It was so awesome being able to see my pup on the camera! They even sent me photos of her throughout the day. It made a huge difference having someone with the dogs throughout the day. We will definitely be coming back!</text>

We love Doggie Daycare! When I contacted them they were prompt with returning my email and phone calls. My 6 month old puppy had a great time, made new friends and feel in love with the staff. We are excited to go back. Thank you to all at Doggie Daycare!<//review>

<Review>It was my first time going to doggy day care, I only had my dog for a month, so I was really nervous about leaving him anywhere.  The staff took great care of him, I watched him on the cameras throughout the day and he seemed to have a ball!  The staff are constantly present, petting and loving the dogs, Picking them up etc.  when they return them to me, they told me how well he did, that he ate all of his food and that he was very sweet!  I’ll definitely use them again and recommend them to other friends.<//Review>< pics>

Ziggy loves her time at Doggie Daycare! She was a little nervous in the beginning going to a new place, but Stephanie is always so kind and sweet to her, that she quickly gained her trust. On the cameras throughout the day I can see the staff playing with the dogs, throwing a ball for fetch, blowing bubbles, and giving them lots of attention and love. Such a great staff! A true blessing to have found this place! It’s nice to have a peace of mind knowing your dog is in the best hands. -Mary<//Text>

We loved bringing our 3 dogs to Doggie Daycare & More today!
My boyfriend & I went whale watching so we had the dogs stay here during our day. They are very reasonably priced & offer discounts for multiple dogs.
We loved having access to the cameras to watch the dogs in the playroom. They even sent us pictures of the dogs with their new friends!
If we come back in town (which I’m sure we will), they will be playing here again!< /text>

<Review>Doggie daycare & more was my go-to doggy daycare for years. My dog loves going there even though he has a little bit of separation anxiety. I love that they have cameras for you to spy on your pup throughout the day and my dog just looooved running around and going crazy with all the other dogs there. The best part of doggy daycare and more to me was the cage free boarding as my dog was never kennel trained and is not used to being in a cage. The overnight workers would always send me cute pics of my dog sleeping together with other dogs and I loved it. The only reason I stopped taking my dog here was because it became too expensive (I was spending almost $300 a month here) if I had the money I would drop him off there all the time. I wish they had some special prices for loyal customers. Anyway, great place to take your dog for boarding or daycare. Highly recommend!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Bella LOVES this doggy daycare and we do too! The team genuinely loves what they do, from the attendants to the owners. Bella is a super high energy and social German Shepherd, Siberian Husky mix, and she begs us to bring her each morning to play with her friends at Doggy Daycare & More. We also board her when we go out of town. On one of our recent trips across country, Bella got sick and the team treated her as I would. They took her to her vet, stayed with her, kept a close eye on her, made sure Bella had forced breaks, administered her meds, all while keeping me updated throughout the day. I am so appreciative of this team. They are truly like no other. This place is Bella's second home and we're so lucky we found them!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>My dog is the happiest dog on earth just with the thought of going there. Ask if he wants to go to the Doggie care he starts jumping wagging his tail and fetches his leach. When we get there he has his eyes glued to the front door and at the slightest movement of the door he starts to wiggle his tail. Best place on earth for dog care</Text>< pictures>

This was my first time leaving my pup (who just turned 5 months) in boarding with many friends to play with. He was still in the process of becoming more social with other dogs and his stay here helped in every way! The staff is very professional and caring towards your pets. They do not disappoint! Don’t hesitate and fuss looking for the perfect place for your pet because I guarantee this will be the place you fall in love with!! We will definitely be returning here again!

P.s. They have an outstanding groomer! No cuts, no nix. Flawless cut and a super smooth coat!< /Text>

They did an amazing job updating us with pictures of our pup while he was at daycare and before the sleepover. If I could give 10 stars I would. I had no anxiety about leaving my dog there, which is really hard for a business to accomplish! We’ll be back!<//text>

We’re still in our first week here, but so far impressed! The staff was helpful and responsive. My dog is shy, so I knew she’d be timid at first and would take a few visits to fully warm up. With that, I loved that they have accessible cameras to check in. The first time I looked at the camera, I was happy to see the staff member petting her and engaging with the other dogs. We look forward to continuing with Doggie Daycare and more!< /text>

<text>I love Doggy Daycare and More! They are reasonably priced. And they give me peace on mind when I go out of town and my family is unable to watch my dog. Being able to watch her on my phone and receiving pictures of her every night & throughout the day makes me worry less. Highly recommend them if you’re unable to take your fur baby with you on your next trip! Make sure to plan ahead as they require them to stay for a half day prior to overnight boarding them.<//text>< pictures>

I have been taking my shy dog to doggie day care for years. And he loves it!  The facility is always clean and I cannot say enough about the staff. They truly care about every dog there. Everybody is awesome..and knows your dog. They play with them and  will give you any updates from the day. Also  I like that I can look in on him via the camera.  I like that there are separate areas for large,small and older dogs.  And I love  that they require up to date vaccines and will notify you if one is expiring .
I trust them with my dog..that speaks volumes.<//review>

<Review>We have been taking our dog Bella here for a couple years now, and we have always been very happy with the excellent care that has been provided. All the staff team genuinely cares for the pups and treat the pups like their own. You will have complete confidence leaving your fur baby while you are away. Recently, our dog Bella became paralyzed and is now a special needs dog that requires more attention and care. After chatting with Roseann with the update in Bella’s health, she told me to come in and we could discuss what extra assistance she would require. Roseann took notes, instructed her staff of the change in her needs, and with continued compassion and care took on our pup with these conditions. This further reiterated our prior feelings of confidence and gratitude for the amazing staff at Doggie Daycare.  Thank you so much for all you do.< /Review>< GmapID>

The team at Doggie Daycare ... and More is awesome! Everyone is really friendly and my dog loves coming to visit. I have a 14yr old schnauzer who goes to play in “the Beach” with the older crowd ☺️ He gets his playtime in, and I feel comfortable dropping him off while I’m at work knowing he’s well cared for. The facility is clean and spacious and rates are pretty reasonable for the attention my little guy gets at a 5-star facility.  I’m really happy that they are still able to accommodate daycare pups during COVID with a modified, safe drop-off/pick-up protocol. 💛<//text>

<Text>I watch my dog on my phone when she is at doggie daycare, and her tail is wagging every time I look. When I drop her off, she is very excited going with the care giver. When I pick her up she sleeps for hours, and she seem to mature faster after she started doggie daycare. She is only 15 weeks old, and this is exactly what she needs.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

We were having our home fumigated and had to board our pups. We were nervous since it was the first time ever we were doing this but Rebecca explained the process and made me feel better. They first had to go do a half day in daycare so they could be assessed since they have a cage free environment. We got to watch the pups on the webcam and saw how attentive the staff was towards the dogs. I really liked how they made sure dogs weren’t being obnoxious towards each other and play never got out of hand. The best part of watching was seeing how much fun my dogs were having! One of them really loves water and she was having a blast jumping in the water feature. The half day made me feel much better about letting them care for my fur babies.

We dropped off 4 pups (3 German Shepard and 1 Jack Russell), unfortunately the JRT got separated from her siblings and cousin but they all got to sleep together. They sent me pictures of them at the slumber party and they looked very comfortable.They slept the whole day when we got them back and it was incredible since one of the German Shepard’s has so much energy and never sleeps! We will definitely keep using doggie daycare for our future needs :) thank you!</Text>

I was very appreciative of the LAST MINUTE Approval for my Dog. Email sent, info given,approved quickly. GOOD ASPECTS: RESPONSIVE, ABLE TO VIEW ANIMALS FROM CAMERA, IF YOU bring your own food they will feed pet at no extra cost, $27/less than 5 hours, $45/over5 hours, Friendly Staff. Dissapointments: Only 1 Camera View and there were spots obstructed/ incapable of seeing various angles on camera so my pet would "dissappear" for a duration of time, Viewed my pet asking to be pet several times over an hour window and he was ignored each time. , Staff did not give me back "uneaten" food so there was NO Way to tell how much he had eaten. When I asked staff at first he stated "oh he ate most of it so I didnt bring it. Then when asked if he could just bring back what was not eaten...he went and came back stating "oh, they said he ate half and did not keep the rest..." Hmmm.... Ok. So the Truth was Who Knows if my dog really ate?? Suggestion: Give EXPLICIT feeding instructions that you NEED FOOD BACK that is u eaten. So you will hopefully know if your oet ate anything.  Then again..I forgot to ask about feeding policy. I dont know if dogs are fed apart or in groups?
Last Negative for me was that my dog was kept in "THE BEACH" Room the whole 4+ hours which is all CONRETE. I never saw small dogs transitioned to the small Faux grass area. Meaning; my dog never went bathroom because he would NEVER EVER Pee on a concrete Indoor Area. Only if it was a faux grass area. So he did not pee or poop the whole time and if he had been kept the full day that could if been an issue!
Overall, I may go here again in a pinch. Quick service, friendly staff. You just need to be SPECIFIC on your needs and ask if they can accommodate.< /Text>

<Text>Started coming here after new management ruined Doggietown in HB. It's actually cheaper, and nicer facilities, and I like that I can check in on my girl on the webcam whenever I want to make sure she's having fun and safe too!< /Text>< date>

This place is amazing.  I bring my dog for daycare and I board him there when I go away.  The staff sleep overnight with the dogs in big beds!  No cages ever.  Daycare is wonderful and they separate the dogs by weight.  The staff and owners love dogs and it shows.  My dog gets so much love there.<//Text>

My rescue dog LOVES everyone here. He is very testy with people, but the sweetest at daycare. He is always well taken care and I love that I can watch him live online. Pricing is affordable and he is always ready on time.<//review>

We love doggie daycare. Our dog is always running in their doors because he’s excited to see his friends there! They treat our pup so well and even offer cheap baths while they’re there.<//review>

This place is awesome. My puppy loves it here, and the staff is super nice. The rate here is also wayyy less than any other place I've seen around here. The best part is they don't use kennels. The doggies all get to sleep together and find a cuddle buddy.</Review>

Also love that you can keep tabs on your dog via the website that have.  Was visiting my daughter and this place was not only convenient but well priced.

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I’m so happy with my dogs experience here!! They separate the dogs into three different areas by weight/size. This makes my smaller dog a lot more comfortable because he’s hanging out with dogs his size. Plus the kennel free boarding is truly unique and special. The fact that my dog can sleep next to a staff makes me so happy because he is a true cuddle bug. Lastly, the fact that you can sign up to watch him on the cameras is wonderful</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dcdf89510793b3:0x813033118e2b8fbf< /gmap_id></record>

I plan to use Doggie Day care regularly.

<rating>5< /rating><review>Wow, a wonderful place to leave your dog. We live near the Oregon boarder and had to come to Orange County to visit family. We have a little beagle and decided to try out this doggie daycare because we had a lot of plans with family where we could not take our dog, (like one day in Catalina, etc., etc.,).  Anyway, the staff at this doggie daycare were exceptional.  The facilities were very clean and the staff was professional, extremely courteous, friendly and caring. I highly recommend this place to care for your dog.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Doggie Daycare... And More is a great place to take your dog for exercise and socialization.  The staff is very caring and the facility has always looked clean.  The dogs are never leave alone so that staff can respond in any situation.  Their systems generate reminders too in order to make sure that everyone is up to date on shots, which is a relief.  They also very conscientious about any concerns.  My dog is always completely worn out after being there for the day.  Just note that if your dog loves water as mine does, then you'll probably have to give them a quick bath once you get home.< /Review>< rate>

He was going somewhere else but they weren't cage free like this place is.  He comes home tired but not anxious like he would from the other place.  I realized it was because the other place had him crated more than not crated.  They have little fun events and today Santa is coming for pics!  Everyone is very nice.  Pricing is definitely high but hey you work you spend hard and for my fur baby I have no problem doing that!  CLEAN, PROFESSIONAL AND THEY LOVE YOUR DOGS.< /Text>< pics>

My German Shepherd, Luna, loves Doggie Daycare and More! As a dog mom I do not feel guilty sending Luna to daycare or to be boarded because I know she is playing and having fun instead of being locked in a small crate. I absolutely love that she can sleep on a cot with her buddies and that someone is with her at all times. When we bring her home she is totally pooped so I know she had a blast playing! We have been coming here for about 3 years and will continue to come, we live in HB but happily make the drive (passing lots of other boarding places) because of how awesome Doggy Daycare and More is!< /review>

This place is really nice and has great hours.  We were just down there for the day to go to Catalina and they made it super convenient to drop our dog off for day early in the morning and pick her up when we came back.  She seemed to have a great time there and it was very well run!<//review>

This is the only place I feel comfortable leaving  my dog. The camera’s plus the personal text messages make you feel so comfortable. Also when you login to check on your pup and you see the staff playing with him and loving him as you would, really gives you peice of mind when you are on the other side of the country.<//Review>

What a special place to leave your furry best friend! The small dog room is perfect for my little guy; he feels safe and free to play and get to know new friends. The camera system makes it easy for me to check in and make sure he is behaving like a gentleman. The staff really loves dogs, and it shows! They are always throwing a ball or giving the pups some much deserved pats. No cages here, so the dogs can feel like they are on vacation when you’re not with them. I highly recommend this place!<//text>

This is the only place I feel comfortable leaving  my dog. The camera’s plus the personal text messages make you feel so comfortable. Also when you login to check on your pup and you see the staff playing with him and loving him as you would, really gives you peice of mind when you are on the other side of the country.<//Review>

This had truly changed my little guys life. He is a very high energy pup and was spending most of his day (if not all) sleeping and would be such a chaotic tornado when we would get home from work. He literally falls asleep the second I put him in his car seat after picking him up. He loves going, and even has a few favorite staff members who seemingly love on him as much as I do which makes me AND my fur guy happy. Thank you team you guys are amazing!</Review>

I have been researching doggy daycare’s for my puppy and this place came up several times in conversations with fellow dog owners as fabulous. While I was waiting to check my puppy in for her first day, some folks that were also waiting in the lobby were telling me that they have been going there since the opening several years ago and couldn’t speak more highly of the staff and the facility. I agree. I am so grateful for such wonderful service, such loving care, and affordable pricing. This is a wonderful place, and I thank you!< /text>

This place and the people who run it are the best amazingly awesome ever to happen here in Costa Mesa! I work out of my home have 3 small dogs who tend to bark slightly more often than needed. I went to a fundraiser Doggy Daycare had and LOVED the place. The daycare is super clean smells wonderful, all the dogs are happy and having a blast every time I'm dropping off or picking up, The facility is air conditioned unlike my house, the staff and owners are super sweet, extremely caring and you can even view your doggies playing with the web cams they set up. Since my kids have been going to daycare, they are so much calmer on their walks and with other dogs and they love going to see their friends. THANK YOU SO MUCH! I would highly recommend Doggie day care, their inside spa facilities and boarding to everyone!

Great place for your loved pups to play.  I love they are never caged.  They roam and play with the pack leaders and can take a dip in the pool.  If you want a safe fun place to leave your dog, this is the place to go.  Being able to watch them on the webcam anytime I want is such a plus and gives me peace of mind that I have picked the right place.  I will never take my dogs anywhere else.<//text>

The staff is always friendly, the hours very convenient, and Amber will run to the door to get to the play area where she LOVES hanging out with her dog and human friends running, playing catch, and getting cuddles all day. It’s a clean, well run facility and we recommend Doggie Daycare & More to everyone. 👍🏻</Review>< Pics>

This place has literally changed our lives for the better.  Our little guy is a very high energy breed, and he was driving us crazy.  I could not wait until he was fully vaccinated because I wanted to see if daycare would tire him out.  As soon as the vet gave us the all clear, and he had all his vaccinations, he was introduced to all of his new best friends.  He absolutely cannot wait to get in there now.  When we enter the parking lot he starts tugging at his seat belt.  The best part? (besides the indoor waterfall and friendly staff)  He is pooped by the time he gets home.  He actually cuddles now because he isn't bouncing off the walls.  I cannot recommend Doggie Daycare and More enough.<//Review>

I took my dog in for the first visit and I was a little unsure. The staff was excellent. I signed up for the viewing option so I could see my dog. I saw she was very calm walking around with the other dogs without a care. I was very please. We will definitely be back.<//Text>

Over all, pretty upsetting experience. I will never take him here again.</review></record></dataset><record>

Very positive experience. The place is professionally run with great attention to best care practices for the dogs so that they have a happy and healthy time while there, and the staff are really helpful and efficient when dropping off and picking up. I trust this place completely and don't worry when I have to leave my dogs.</review>

<Review>They will take care of your dog like its one of their own. I left my baby Shusha with them last month for 5 days while on a business trip back to Canada and they texted my photos as well as updated me whenever I called.

<text>I was all set to bring our dog in after talking to one of their staff members named Josh, who told me all I would need is his vet records and we would be all set!  Then, another staff member asked me via e-mail what his breed was and how long I had him.  When she found out that he was a Pittie/German Shepard mix that we adopted from a shelter (though on their website that say that they encourage adoption), apparently adopting also means they don't know the history of that dog and will refuse to allow them at their facility.  They discriminate based on breed (yet another sad irrational fear of a breed rather than of the dog themselves) and if they are from a shelter.  if you care about centers that support doing the right thing, and that do not spread hateful breed stereotypes do not use this facility.

When we pick him up he sleep for for about a day and half. We also notice that has couldn't stop sneezing and snorting. We took him to the vet and he said that he has kennel cough. When we first called someone on the phone they said it's really important to bring in the shot record, but when we showed them to the lady she just glazed over it not really checking the dates.  Also I don't think they have an area to take the dogs outside during the day, my pup came back peeing and pooping inside the house.</review><Time>1452532555421< /Time>< Response>

Nice facility friendly staff dogs about taking care of but it's expensive there's
1.  Day fee
2. Night fee.
2. Dog Food fee. / but the tap Water is free.
Then the add on's come in give the dog a shampoo give the dog a flea bath trim the nails care for the ears any vet<//text>

Called to try and board my dog. Absolutely disgraceful. They DO discriminate based on breed which is completely ridiculous. I have a regular vet I've taken my dog to for 10 years and never once had a problem in any way, shape, or form. I would have taken my dog to a different daycare, but they didn't have time to test her. Maybe they should change their name so that people know that some breeds are not allowed there.< /text>

I absolutely LOVE this place! We've taken our dog here for both daycare and boarding services. Our dog is always super excited when we pull up to the building and cannot wait to get inside.

My favorite feature of the facility is the webcam. If you're worrisome about the experience, know that you can easily download a mobile app and check in on your furbaby periodically throughout the day. Not to mention, they're fantastic about keeping you updated when you do use the boarding services. For example, we went to Denver recently for seven days and they kept us in the loop throughout our trip by sending photos and updates.

I can say I am a proud owner of a pitbull mix (aka an aggressive breed to most) and this facility and their owners were MORE THAN willing to accommodate our needs and welcomed us with open arms. They're like any other facility in the sense that they have a process and at times there is a waiting list. You cannot simply drop your animal off for daycare or boarding anywhere without some sort of assessment. People should be happy to know there are guidelines set in place, which I'm sure are for our animals' safety.

We're super bummed to no longer live just five minutes away, but I will drive any distance to board my dog here! Sign up and you will it be not be disappointed!</Review>

I had a great experience. There was ample time on the motorcycle for practical experience with overall excellent instruction. However, there were some of the exercises or drills that or a little difficult to understand. What I thought the exercise was and what it actually was,  a couple times were different.  That was especially true for the turn drills.The instructors walked the path, not just demonstrated on the motorcycle,  which brought clarity for me. Our instructors were flexible, responsible, respectful, supportive and able to effectively transmit their enthusiasm as well as knowledge.  I highly recommend this course.  I look forward to taking the intermediate course in the future.<//review>

<Review>My experience was great.  All of the instructors where so friendly and most importantly very knowledgeable. It was my first time riding a bike and I was a bit timid the first day of riding, but soon I felt at ease because of the instructors.  When mistakes where made they would pull me to the side and show me what I was doing wrong and how to correct it.  I look forward to taking more courses with Pacific Motorcycle Training in the future.  Thank you to all the instructors for your help and patience.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Fun easy program to learn safety riding,by the time I left I was not only knowledgeable in riding but also in motorcycle situations to avoid or how to get around a potential hazard.The instructors were amazing and tony was very helpful and I appreciate him for starting me on my road to be a safe expert rider.< /Text>

The class was absolutely invaluable and anyone who intends to ride motorcycles on or off the street should take at least the introductory/beginner class. Great experience!<//text>< UserId.>

And Psy and Mica (forgive my spelling on names)
were great instructors explanation and the whole nine yards.

It was overall a good class. I've been riding street bikes for 37 years and can honestly say that they were teaching with real world experience.
Mica and Eric? I believe, did a great job and truly seemed to enjoy teaching. George on the other hand, although knowledgeable, seemed like he had never actually taken a class on HOW to teach.
I teach high speed and pursuit driving to veteran officers as well as new hires and photography and evidence collection to CSI's. By far the best class I have taken is one that taught me how to teach.<//text>

Everyone is so kind and helpful! I got pretty nervous halfway through, but they really helped me through it and I ended up feeling way more confident. Ray is super funny and one of the most supportive teachers I’ve ever had. I highly recommend this course!</Review>

This is a good course for those of us new to riding or for those looking to brush up on the basics.  Two days of riding and I went from having no idea where the controls are to navigating a basic driving track.

I thoroughly enjoyed the motorcyle training. Our  instructor was Sigh. He is very knowledgable and helped me correct the issues i needed. This was my first time riding a motorcycle. I would highly recommend this class to any beginners or those looking to sharpen their skills.<//text>

Had an excellent trainer, small groups made it possible to practice longer, the only complaint is that I wish they had some lowered Honda Groms for the women, it’s less intimidating with smaller bikes.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>This was such a useful course. I used my scooter as opposed to using one of their bikes. Hole I wish I would’ve had the full experience of learning manual, I still learned a lot from the material of the course itself. I recommend  this Class to people with no experience as well as people with tons of experience. You’ll learn a ton and have a blast doing it.<//Review>< pics>

<review>I couldn’t be anymore satisfied I took my course here with Pacific Motorcycle Training. I had zero experience on a bike. I’ve never even got on top of one. I didn’t even know how to tie the bottom of my helmet. My Instructor was probably the best teacher I’ve ever had. He had so much patience and so much clarity that by the end of day 1 I was totally comfortable on a bike. Even during the Zoom class I was able to learn well because of the way they always had us interacting. Thank you for much to everyone at PMT. I can’t wait to come back and take my Intermediate Course!! (Also if my instructor is teaching a class during super bike at Laguna Seca, sign me up!)< /review>< Pictures>

I’ve had experience riding motorcycles and i’ve still learned a lot from them. I didn’t like the classroom portion only because it was on zoom because of covid. The instructors were nice and very helpful. Overall would definitely recommend this course.<//review>

The program was so well designed and executed that I not only passed, but left excited to continue practicing my skills with my new motorcycle license. The instructors, especially Ray, were great at giving helpful feedback and encouragement so that you never feel too discouraged or nervous. I would highly recommend this program to anyone.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Great school, I was a previous dirtbike rider.  After completing this course my riding skills definitely improved.  I have learned techniques and skills to be a better and safer rider.  Picked up a 2008 Kawasaki ZZR600 and enjoying it and can ride with confidence thanks to the knowledgeable instructors.  Would recommend PMT to any beginner or even experienced riders.<//Review>< Name>

<user_name>Mary Pozzi</user_name><Time>1572986770150<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>Having never ridden a motorcycle before, I wanted to learn from the best.  After research and talking with others, I selected Pacific Motorcycle Training to get the job done.  They were very knowledgeable and had the students learn each module well before continuing on to the next.  They provided the motorcycles and had several available for us to select from.  The classroom gave us much needed information about being safe on the roadways, types of equipment and apparel to wear for safety and for being visible to other motorists, riding while under the influence and the penalties (both from law enforcement and your physical being) involved, and how to ride during inclement weather and road conditions.  The benefit is that by taking this course you bypass the DMV "riding" part for getting a M1 designation on your drivers license.  You'll still have to take the DMV test (there are two which you can select from) but the dreaded "lollypop" and "weave" part of the "riding" test are avoided completely.

I hugely endorse this class if you're a beginning motorcycle rider and you won't be disappointed.  PMT also offers an Intermediate and Advanced course using your own motorcycle once you've gained some road time and experience.  All in all, a huge WIN for me as the class gave me confidence to ride and the knowledge to help keep me out of trouble.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>This would be a 5 star location but I saw something that I didn’t approve of and well hence the removal of one star. I was in line looking at the baked goods, was going to order one when I saw a gnat flying around. Told the cashier, they opened the case to try to get it out but that was all that was done. The drinks are delicious though but if I’m being honest will think twice to come here now.</Text>< Rate>

Various bean and rice-based dishes and sweet treats, including pastries, are also served.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZmMcsvt9HCjBbAhP08XdTzfDYn-3EfROiOOqO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

The coffee and tea here is great, the staff is friendly and helpful. I’ve tried a variety of drinks here and they were all delicious and well-made. There’s nothing like a vanilla tea latte to relax or a cafe Cubano to wake up. I like the pastries especially the tres leches muffin which they very kindly offer to heat up for you. Even during these trying times, the staff manage to create a welcome atmosphere while keeping customers safe through social distancing, wearing masks, and even offering sanitizer. I would recommend this place to everybody that loves coffee and amazing staff!</text>

I brought my fiance here. He loved it. It does remind me a little of a Starbucks layout, but the coffee is so good. The only issue I find is the parking. Definitely worth it.</text>

Tierra Mia is such a welcoming place. Their workers are all such friendly people.  The orders are taken quickly and they even help out in giving suggestions if you're unsure of what to order. I was happy with how fast my hot chocolate was made and it tasted great ....the place is cozy and awesome to relax, study or chat with a friend. I definitely recommend!</text>

Open during pandemic for pick up. Social distancing enforced. If you're looking for a great do of coffee, got chocolate, frappe, and warmed up muffins this is the place for you. You can't go wrong with Choco mexicano or the orchata either cold or hot.<//text>

I visited Tierra mia coffee yesterday at 11:15pm after a concert, with my wife and 2 other friends, and there were 2 ladies that had a really bad attitude when we ordered our coffees and asked for water, I want to think that they were tired of a long day, but still it's a business and they offer a service, the employees have to know that.
These 2 employees were rolling eyes, doing things as if they were obligated to do their work.
We went to Tierra Mia coffee, because we wanted to have a good time with my friends, when the clock hit 12:00am another employee asked all of the customer to leave, he said because it was 12:00am, because the schedule says they give service 'till 12:00am meaning that if you get there before 12:00am they have to take care of you.</text>

The only reason this wasn't 5 stars is due to the lack of wifi. In today's connected age, that's silly.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I'm willing to drive from Orange, CA. If you want very good coffee with flavor, ask for the horchata cafe or horchata blended. I've had both, and both are awesome. The best idea horchata flavored coffee. I think that they have other coffees too but I have not had a chance to try them yet. If you like sweets get a Tres Leche Muffin. It's like magic how perfect they make the muffins. 👍👍Sometimes I ask for an extra expreso shot.< /review>

Great coffee and tea, good service, nice calm vibe. Valet parking + additional parking at the Jack in the box next door. Just another nice coffee shop to talk or study in. Careful with the homeless around the area. Seems to be growing in numbers and some people seem dangerous and up to no good. So far, Good Coffee spot.<//Text>

The short haired girl at the register was super nice and helpful. She guided me on what I should order and mannnnn she did not disappoint. I don't typically order frappes because they usually taste watered down. Nope! Not the case here. I highly recommend the Chocolate Mexican Frappe because it was absolutely delicious. It literally hit every taste bud. I'm in love with Tierra Mia. I also ordered the Honey Vanilla Tea Latte, man oh man, it was so loo delicious.</Review>

Came in today 10/02/2020 to get 2 cups of tea, and I was going to get 2 bread but there were flys in the in bread cabinet in top of the bread. The cashiers told the I guess it was the manager and the only thing they did they turn off the light from the bread cabinet trying to take them out. And then they turn it back on.... selling bread with flys that’s is some nasty thing really disappointed from this place.<//text>

< Review>
I WISH THEY WOULD OFFER A BIRTHDAY SPECIAL LIKE FREE DRINK LIKE STARBUCKS. THEY ARE DELICIOUS though especially the HORCHATA FRAPPUCCINO. THEY NEED A POINT SYSTEM OR CARD ALSO BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP GOING IT'S PRICY AND YOU END UP SPENDING ALOT OF MONEY WITH NO REWARDS. I ONLY GO HERE ONCE IN A WHILE BUT I LOVE STARBUCKS POINT SYSTEM AND REWARDS CARD..FREE BIRTHDAY DRINK AND ONCE YOU REACH 150 YOU GET A FREE DRINK OF CHOICE ANY SIZE ANY DRINK. PLUS ON THURSDAYS BOGO FREE. THESE ARE THE SPECIALS THAT KEEP PEOPLE COMING MORE OFTEN. YES YOU CAN HAVE DELICIOUS DRINKS BUT IF YOU DON'T REWARD YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS THEN YOU DON'T FEEL APPRECIATED FOR COMING TO THESE BUSINESSES. REMEMBER WITHOUT LOYAL CUSTOMERS NO BUSINESS CAN SURVIVE. GIVING EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE, GREAT QUALITY PRODUCTS AND GREAT OFFERS WILL KEEP ANY BUSINESS GOING. 👍<//Review>

This location is chill. The cashier was a really cool girl and seemed really happy to be working there. The parking is good too but when I went it wasn't too busy so they're was a few spots open. The coffee is amazing! Tierra Mia will always be my top coffee shop. If you want a premium coffee with high quality you need to come here and forget Starbucks.</review>

<text>Nicely decorated to radiate a calm homey atmosphere, my cashier was friendly, and my chai latte was great. (They recently switched to a spicier mix yay) I've been to another Tierra Mia Coffee and this location upheld the same quality. So like, it should be your go to if you have the choice!<//text>< Time>

<username>Chris Rodriguez</username>< Review>
Coffee is okay. A bit overrated. Not sure if they were training or something but there was like 6 employees and no one knew how to make a cortado. I got a macchiato which was fine but espresso was very under extracted. Too under extracted. Coffee itself is pretty good though. Not sure where they get it and I didn't bother to ask. If you're into the sweet type of coffee drinks that taste like traditional Mexican drinks, then this spot is good for that.<//Review>

Gotta hand it to Tierra Mia. Every location you go to you have the same flavor all the time. Talk about consistency 👌. My two favorite drinks are Cafecito Cubano and Horchata frappe with a shot of espresso.  Highly recommended</review>

One of my favorite coffee places. Can't go wrong with an horchata latte (hot or iced). Coco loco is good and the mocha mexicano.<//review>

The coffee is great, way better than Starbucks and their pastries are delicious too. The only reason why I gave them a 4 star rating is because they don't have enough parking. There is usually a valet that parks your car but even then the parking runs out quick. Also, they take a little longer than most places to make coffee when they're busy. With that said I still love this place and take anyone I can when I get the chance.</Review><UserId.>117455872943123126504</UserId.>< Pictures>

I like the different choices of coffee. A different choice of flavored coffee. A quiet ambience. Parking lot is a bit small and have to wait for someone to leave.</text>

Basically non existent parking lot and small building as well. Not recommended to come in a group, sometimes theres a line to try and sit down. Place and atmosphere is chill/classy but unfortunately location is ridiculously too small to handle the volume of people visiting...<//review>

The drinks here are always so good.  The service is great as well.  Yes it's not fast but at least I know it's done accurately and precise.  I recommend the horchata latte.  Both blended and hot are good.  They also have a good Mexican coffee.  The pastries are delicious as well.<//Review>

We were staying next door at the Best Western for a few days and stopped by here each morning.
The
Place was clean and inviting, and had that fresh brewed coffee smell as soon as we entered.
It does have a very familiar layout if you visit other chain coffee shops, pastry display case next to where you order, with The barista next to that.
Very familiar & comfortable.
The staff while we were there were amazing!
Very friendly and helpful.
We only had the brewed coffee, but it was very good. Not bitter at all, plenty of flavor.
I also had to try, (and try the next day also 😜), the Tres Leche Muffin... very good!!
I can’t speak for all the locations, but this one is a must if you need coffee in the area< /Text>

Quick service with reasonable prices. It's nice enough inside with comfortable seating. Only downside is the crowd. Usually filled with highschool kids who can be a little annoying; otherwise a nice enough place to grab coffee.<//Review>

Hands down best place in South Gate for coffee. Culture meets swank and sophistication. I recommend the Honey Vanilla Tea Latte or Chat Tea Latte with a Cheese Delight or Almond Dulce pastry< /Text>

<Review>Honestly I’ve tried so hard to like this place but their coffee isn’t good. Its not potent or flavorful. Their lattes are so weak and also very sweet. It’s probably a combination of the milk and poor coffee. I couldn’t even finish the regular coffee. It’s seems it’s only their super sweet drinks that please people. I want good coffee and this place doesn’t meet the expectations. Mind you my review is bc I’m an avid coffee lover. You’re talking Blue Bottle, Maru coffee, G&B coffee, stumptown, groundwork coffee etc. you want good coffee for the same price go to DTLA. That’s great stuff. Perhaps they should explore where those places get their coffee. The hype is overrated.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I don't like coffee nor am a "caffeine junkie."  Update: (Now I'm a coffee lover!) Occasionally, I do make the exception every so often whenever I drink a cold beverage from this Latin inspired cafe. Generally, I purchase a small Marizpan drink once or twice a month and a small pastry alongside. It's usually not too crowed during the week days but during the weekend it is. Unlike Starbucks, this cafe won't have sandwiches or bacon gourdas, so a note of precaution, don't get upset if you don't find it here. With that mind, dine in here! Fun fact: This is the first Tierra Mia Coffee from it's franchise.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c2cc187bcd2f75:0x16005e7366e61391<//gmap_id>< rate>

Very limited parking at this location. And honestly, McDonald's coffee tastes better then what I got.
I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again.< /Review>

I really like this place a lot. It's definitely authentic and I've never been anywhere like it. If you're looking for a coffee place with a genuine feel Tierra Mia is definitely what you're looking for. It's alright if you don't know how or what to order because the baristas are super helpful and really nice. Enjoy!</Text>

I always have to stop here on my way back home. I'm only in town once on a while so I take advantage. I recently tried a new drink.  The barista was super nice and said if I didn't like my drink he would change it.  I like that I didn't have to ask.<//Text>

People refer to this as the "Mexican Starbucks" and as such it serves many different drinks. One of my favorites is the horchata latte or the rice and beans iced coffee. Great drinks. I also like that the offer the guava strudel from portos. Just keep in mind that sometimes there is a long wait. Hoping they build one closer to lax<//text>

While this is one of the best coffee's you'll ever taste, and the food is great too, this Pasadena location has been suffering seriously bad service. On this occasion Management was running around the restaurant making sure everything was going well. It's great to see a restaurant and Management get all over a problem and get it resolved swiftly.<//review>

Everytime my family and I came to this location is perfect. (NOTHING to say about the Pacific Ave one so bad 😒 everytime, so disappointed of the service there) The service and the flavor here on Firestone Ave one has been ALWAYS good and kind, OMG the almond danish is so delicious and for my kids the chocolate chip muffins, they love them! The hot late horchata for husband and me so gooooooood and hot chocolate for the kids we  had to come every Sunday morning to get this delicious day started ... Completely recommend but! In this location lol ...< /text>

<Review>It was my first time going to Tierra Mia ,So I ask which one was the most popular drink and a gentleman there suggested for me to order their  horchata because that's what they're known for,He also told me if I didn't like  he would gladly change My drink  to another flavor,So wind-up ordering their second popular one the (Chocolate abuelita)It was delicious..Excellent!

Excellent service, great menu. Most of the staff are always in a great mood. I've only come across one or two cashiers with a 'whatever, I don't really want to be here" attitude but the rest of the staff makes up for that.

Prices are reasonable on most items but Im still not sold on paying over four dollars for a cup of Joe. Specialty drinks?ok. Cup of coffee?.. NO.
I would expect that from some silly place like blue bottle or the classic and pretentious handsome coffee roasters.

Nice assortment of pastries (not frozen, btw. They make their own not far from here) so kuddos for that. I come here to edit on my laptop and for the white noise which Allows me to get in the zone.

I do love the fact that they do not have Wi-Fi and that is because they want to promote social interaction. It is pretty refreshing to look around and see people engaging with each other as oppose to a room full of people with their faces burried in their devices or doing that stupid vertical zombie swipe as they stare blankly into their phone.

Gets a little busy at 7pm ish and if you can drown out the occasional children running around you will be fine.

Over all I like this place. No snobbery from baristas or foul attitudes.

Henry is usually on shift when I come. I love his positive attitude He's always working hard, multi tasking, supporting his team and always goes out of his way  to acknowledge the guests.</Review>

The horchata frappe tasted like a horchata milk shake, really not sure if there is any coffee in it.  Tried the tres leche muffin, and it is like any old vanilla muffin, where's the leche??

The straight up pour over coffee is decent though, but the hype over the sugary drinks are overrated.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>I am in love with their Cubano con Leche! not too sweet and its very smooth yet strong just like cafe cubano :) My friend took me there for the first time this morning and I know for a fact that I will not settle for Starbucks anymore! I can't wait to try the Mocha Mexicano and all the others.  I hope the open one in downtown L.A. I am sure it would be a hit! As far as the prices, I don't mind paying a high price for excellent coffee! I've been paying more or less the same amount at Starbucks for added shots the Cubano con Leche is strong and smooth - what more do I want :)<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) They have x for social distance
They fill the x's in the box and they want you to be outside waiting without caring that it's cold
And meanwhile ay x empty where you wait for your order 🤔
Because they don't think about charging for you to go to the x where you expect the order
But they don't
They just order you to be in the x's or wait outside in this cold
I'm leaving money so they have a better place and better customer service
No more land of mine

(Original)
Tienen x para distancia social
Se llenan las x de la caja y quieren que estés afuera esperando sin importarles que este frío
Y mientras tanto ay x vacías en donde esperas tu orden 🤔
Porque no piensan en estar cobrando para que pases a las x donde esperas la orden
Pero no lo asen
Solo te ordenan que estés en las x o esperes afuera con este frío
Estoy dejando dinero para que tengan un mejor lugar y mejor atención al cliente
No más tierra mía</Text>

(Translated by Google) They should have more variety in the food menu according to the TIERRA MÍA business concept and we only find American type snacks.
