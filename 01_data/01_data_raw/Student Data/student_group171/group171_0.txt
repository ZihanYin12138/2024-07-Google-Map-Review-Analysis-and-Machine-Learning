While the office was not the cleanest, the hygienist was very kind, and I was able to get a cleaning with no issue.
However, anyone who is looking to get wisdom teeth extracted here should be very cautious. I was told, by the secretary, that the oral surgeon will not extract wisdom teeth without doing bone grafting, which costs around $1800 out of pocket, since it is cosmetic and not covered. Everyone should do their own research, but this is uncommon for many wisdom teeth extractions. I was able to get the opinion of an outside oral specialist who advised me against doing this procedure. It seems like this is a scam some offices will try to pull when they want more than the insurance payout. If they refuse to extract your wisdom teeth without a bone graft, definitely get a second professional opinion and don't get taken advantage of.< /text>

This location is the worst place to go to. I had several visits over the years. They will do anything to get you to their office and hard sell you to do work on your teeth whether you need it or not. Example I asked if the tooth I was referring to my insurance would cover to get a cap. Before my insurance wouldn't cover it. I spoke to Nara, First thing she says is come in. Why would I want to come in when they can tell me on the phone. They were able to do this before. Then I told her if you can't answer the question then please let me speak to someone who can. They gave this information over the phone before when I asked in the past. Then she said I can't help you and put me on hold for 30 minutes. So instead of transferring me over to someone else she put me on hold and didn't say a word to anyonen in the office. This is exactly what I mean the kind of attitude they have there. The attitude displayed in this office permeates through everyone that works there. This has been my experience there. All I can say it's better to go to another location and maybe you'll get better service and kindness. Management to the frontline: Do whatever it takes to get the patient to the office so we can sell them our service. It's all about making money! The 4 or 5 star posts that people make are friends of the associates that work there. Go figure!</text>

I called back and the office was closed.I am very disappointed at her.I hear they were exensive ,but they were close by me.Overall I don't want to spend more $ in that office but I do like the dental assistant team.I will report the fraud,so people are aware</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Awesome. Everyone has a positive attitude and are very friendly. If you have questions they answer honestly and in detail. Techs are very helpful. Felt no pain getting shots and a deep cleaning and fillings. Was checked in very quickly and was in the chair in no time each time I went. Each time I was estimated 45 minutes and was out the door in 35. Dr is fast and efficient but doesn’t hurt You or rush. Everyone does a great job.< /Text>

< Review>
The dental staff is cordial face to face. The wait-times consist of being seen 1 hour after your scheduled appointment time. They drop appointments the day-of if its anything but hygiene. I came to this dentistry in December for a root canal and still have not had it completed. It is now August. No reason to make this up. Suggest services else-where with better presentation. My Girl had the same happen for her as well.</Review>

This is my first visit to this office of Western Dental.  Everyone was outstanding.  I have dental anxiety and will avoid rather than go to the dentist.  Everyone was reassuring, took their time to help me with each procedure.  After today I feel like I can go to the recommended office visits and be well taken care of.  Thanks Adrian and Dr. Payam.<//review>

I wish I could give less than 1 star.

I requested an appointment to have my permanent retainer fixed, as it has been cutting the bottom of my tongue and making me bleed. The gentleman from the call center made my appointment no problem. I arrived on time (15 min early), filled out my paperwork, then was told I couldn't be seen because their doctors wouldn't touch something like what I have. The woman up front also told me she wouldn't keep my paperwork and start a chart for me so I could return for a cleaning in the future, because they will probably lose it. What I take from that is not only are their doctors incompetent, the front desk personnel are also incompetent, unprofessional, and too lazy to do their jobs. Huge waste of my time, I will not be returning and I will recommend that NOBODY goes there to receive dental care.< /text>

<Review>Horrible horrible horrible. This is the most unorganized, unprofessional business I've been in. My first visit ever had to be rescheduled because they were running 3hours behind. (how that's my fault, not sure). During that visit I was told multiple times I needed an insurance card which my insurance company has stated several times I do not need a card. Only provide them with my social. But the receptionist insisted. Why would she not just call my insurance herself to clarify? *Rocket science*. When I finally had my visit the dentist and dental hygienist were friendly and professional. No issues there. However I needed more work up on a certain tooth and was told by front desk they would make referral personally and I would hear from them with the referred specialist name. Do you think I've heard from them? Negative. Lastly I scheduled a 6 month follow up for a cleaning (which took the guy on the phone 30 min to do and I couldn't understand anything he said). I come to my appointment 30 min early and is told by front desk staff I'm not schedule. CONFUSION. How is this possible, I have the voicemail from the business confirming my appointment. Which I show front desk staff. I'm told they don't know who made the appointment, they can't find me, and I have to re-schedule. Now why would I do that when I've already taken off work, time out of my day and my check? Wrong. Wouskt even allow me to be seen that day after the last patient.  I refuse to set foot inside this so call business ever again. Worst experience I've ever had at a dentist. They did nothing to accommodate me for them wasting my time. No appreciation for the customer. I've already called my dental insurance and made the switch. Glad to see them off my plan!! <3</Review>< pics>

My visit last Friday was on of the best encounter's I've had at a Dentist office in a long time.. The wait time could be a bit better but the staff actually talks to their patients and from what I saw, they recognize each patient too. I made my appointment with Gloria and she was great! She checked my insurance two days prior to my appointment and let me know how my first visit would go, because I'm sure I seemed very anxious! In my exam I really felt the Doctor took his time making sure I felt comfortable and explaining what he was doing as he was doing it, awesome! After my exam, I made my next appointment starting with a cleaning, nothing too scary! Thanks Western Dental.<//Review>

<Text>I got my wisdom teeth taken out today, and when i get out of anesthesia I’m often extremely emotional. So I had fits of crying and laughing, my mother my cane in the room and I cried when I saw her and they where telling her that she made me cry. Uh no the HELL she didn’t, and they told me they’d make her go back in the waiting room and that I wouldn’t be able to go home. Then the doctor basically told me to shut up because I was distributing other patients, like DUDE I JUST GOT OUT SURGERY, I obviously can’t regulate my emotions< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

My experience at Western Dental is derived from a new patient aspect!  My insurance carrier provided Western Dental’s information!  I called and was able to be seen THE NEXT DAY!  I’d chipped my front tooth and needed urgent care.  I came in and received professional care and information in a timely manner.  I asked lots of questions and we addressed several concerns.  I’m glad I found Western Dental!  We’re working on that Smile I lost years ago (due to missing teeth) as a team!  Thanks, Western Dental...</review>

This office cancelled my surgery 2xs not because of something I did, but because they didn't give proper notice and not only that but I guess it was my fault that after me having several visits there they forgot to check the 1st paperwork I filled out stating that I was a diabetic.  Not only that but exams and consultations are free and I've paid them over $400 and hasn't even received mouthwash.  They are also committing insurance fraud because my insurance was charged $129 for what I don't know because it's not stated what my insurance was charged for when I was told my insurance hadn't been charged. I will be contacting a lawyer due to yall negligence.< /text>

Lab screws them up sometimes but they still do their best

First of all, my name is not Johnny.

Second, while the personnel at the dental office has been really pretty good, your office staff and accounts payable department has been pretty awful.
I entered into a credit agreement to pay for additional work. That is fine.
However, I never ONCE, ever received a statement or invoice. I call the office every month to ask for one, and get nothing but attitude from the people answering the phone. The last person was so rude I asked for a supervisor and got basically the same bad attitude.

I requested a statement yet again, and yet again, have never received it.

There is simply no excuse for the poor attitude and even worse performance from that office.  My initial fears were that the dentistry staff would be rough but they have been good. However, based on the lack of responsiveness  from the customer service department I would give Western Dental A FAIL. In fact, it is not customer service, it is customer abuse.

A shame that a few horrible people on the phone can offset a decent experience at the practice.</text>

<Review>I recently went Into western dental and was greeted and helped by Gloria. She was very friendly and definitely knew everything she was talking about. She was easy to talk to and was very welcoming. Even when I was waiting to be called she asked if I needed anything or if the dentist was almost ready to call me in. I had other bad experiences with receptionist and they seemed bored and didn’t care about helping me but Gloria was total opposite. Also Adrian who did my cleaning was super gentle and kind. You can tell he loved what he does for a job. Because of both of them, I’d definitly come back.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1545353969723, 'text': 'mae, we are happy to hear your experience was to your expectations.

After walking up to the front desk I stood in line for a while to get some info. There was a young lady who noticed I was waiting in line and called me to help me out! ( Which was Awesome ) !Well the reason for my review is because of the young lady who assisted me. I'm not even a patient there and she was so friendly, she had a big smile on her face the entire time she was helping me and answering my  Q's. I noticed a pin on her that talked about rating her customer service. She explained to me that she was trying to restore the offices reviews and reaching out to patients about that matter! I'm not a patient there but Man  the young lady Cilvana definitely helped me out. Apparently I need a specialist but because of my insurance I will need a direct referral. She was very knowledgeable about everything which is why I made this review. It's great to see there are people out there who actually care!</review>

<review>I booked my appointment almost a month ago and when I come in today they tell me they couldn’t verify my insurance?!? I don’t understand why if I booked my appointment so long ago they couldn’t notify me in advance that they were unable to verify my insurance so we could’ve gotten this resolved. What a waste of my gas and time, Seriously! They have like 8 people working behind that front desk and some how they are still unorganized.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Too long of a wait even with appt was here for hours they never called us back when they were supposed to get a referral. Also I have to let you know I had braces with western dental for 4 years, my tooth that was surgically pulled down guess what just found out it died, would not recommend this dental company to anyone. I no longer have my military insurance so can't do anything about it thanks western dental.</Review>

<username>Shala Waines</username><Review>My appointment was scheduled for 10am. I arrived at 9:45. They didn't call me back until 10:38.  The Xray technician Omar was very nice! We even laughed about the OVERPRICING from my previous dentist office. He was done with everything around 11:00. Here it is 11:42 and I am still waiting for the Dentist to come in.

Had me waiting on that dirty chair for an hour and a half after they had number my gums!  They are horrible!  I don't understand how they are still in business. It was my first time going so I looked up the reviews.  I saw many negative ones but I decide to give it a shot anyways.  I regret it so bad.  I asked to speak to a supervisor,  and apparently  he was too busy to come speak with me when they only had two patients.  Horrible service.  That place needs to burn down!!!!!<//review></record>

<Review>This is a late post but I want to share this for those are looking for a good dentist clinic for themselves. Yeah this isn’t a good review about them. Every dam time I go check in for my appointment they always give me the same pocket to sign up because they can’t find me In there computer.. How is that possible... Another time when I waited for hours and hours just to get called back in the back, when they finally did and I was the last person in the clinic so they decided to talk among them selves (is was probably every employee in the clinic). Once they’re done fooling around the next thing they told me is best if they reschedule my appointment to another day because they were about to close. They had all the time to just wash my teeth but instead they took the time to fool around.... I go to a different dentist now with better service and cares about their patients.</Review></record>

This is the worst Dental office Ive ever been to. While extracting teeth they send a sales person in to sale you a bone graph that has not worked at a cost of over $1000. When I went back to get an adjustment because the dentures dont fit, now mind you they been paid, they left me sitting in waiting room for over an hour and half and even took customers whos appt. time was after mine. Save your money and mouths and go somewhere else.< /review>

If I could give them Zero stars I would. We set an appointment at 3:30. We showed up and while filling out the paperwork, the lady came out and tells us her dentist wants to go home after his current patient and he wont see us today. She said cooperate scheduled the appointment they werent expecting us but we did have an appointment. I was disgusted by there attitude and customer service. I wish I had a Job where I could leave just because I didnt want to take care of my patients. I will be further contacting cooperate to get this place taken care of. Not to mention the front desk receptionist was dressed in camo sweatpants and a hoodie. Very professional!< /review>

The staff is terrible. I arrive to an empty waiting room with a scheduled appointment. I had called the office staff ahead of time and asked them to check my insurance. When I arrived I asked them about it and they hadn't done it yet. 40 minutes later and they tell me it is covered. Great, people came in within this time and were able to go in before I did. Another 30 minutes and I'm finally let in to see the dentist. Or so I thought! I have to get a few xrays to see my teeth. Fine. Get 2 xrays for EVERY set of teeth because the technician can't do it right in 1 try? NOT FINE. Get checked by the dentist for 5 minutes telling me my teeth are fine and get a teeth cleaning from a different assistant (quick 20 minute job which is the only redeeming factor). The front staff didn't even tell me how long I needed to wait or apologized for making me sit there waiting while people after me get to go in ahead of me. Terrible office team with the only good person as the one who cleaned my teeth.

Got in right before 2pm. Got out at 4:30pm. Terrible.

TLDR: Don't go here.< /text>

< Review>
I set an appointment for 9am not knowing thats when they opened. They told me to show up 10 min early which I showed up 20 min early. They took my paper work and spent 45 minutes verifying my insurance information they wouldnt check me in until that information was verified. Meanwhile every customer that came after us was taken care of quickly. When I questioned what was taking so long, they said that they will now check me in. Turned out that the fax from my insurance company was sitting in the fax machine for a while. This place was dirty when we walked in and the employees were still showing up almost an hour after they opened. They werent wearing any identifying uniforms or id tags to show that they worked they, yet they asked for my information. I told them that I couldnt wait any longer and to shred all my paperwork as I will not be returning. This is a horrible dentist and if you value customer service and want to be treated half way decent, then dont come here.</Review>

Front desk...Don't know what thier doing! Messed up on billing...  the light skin woman was nice! But the dark one with a hunch back had attitude. I think she the one that delayed use being seen. Most of staff showed up late with attitude. True I questioned why my appt. Was at 8am an I haven't been seen now 45min. When all I see is doctor an staff walking around doing nothing! After making a complaint I was being mean mugged by staff! Had a stare down with the dentist. Who told me if I don't like thier service to go elsewhere! So we did. All staff in the back where unprofessional! Saturday morning crew sucks Doctors attitude is way unprofessional the one with glassed... treats patients like a dime a dozen! Hope Monday through Friday crew is different... Never Agian on Saturday! Unless you don't mind waiting for unprofessional experience!<//text>

< Review>
amazing customer service, and great product, shipped safely.
these were a HUGE hit as favors for my wedding last October !  they looked beautiful, and the guests were so excited to take them home.
The ones that we re-potted grew like crazy and i still get photos from guests of their succulents and how they are thriving! would definitely order again!< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I love The Succulent Source! I have ordered a plethora of plants and never once have I been dissatisfied. Cactus, aloe, many, many succulents, plugs in many varieties; all wonderful specimens. I mix all kinds of these plants to create arrangements. When I need to fill a vacancy in an arrangement, the plugs are perfect! This family operation delivers a consistently great product.</Text><user_name>Laura Bart<//user_name><Date>1600111965784</Date><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc7O-HULbheq2O4vWeBvVjc3R5UkOeA_UZ1g7I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnk-KUZgHdT4POIjgi9ycgcWjh09IOlBrZAzeE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaDQCXDDC82gL2CayE8dbmYMbd5uMO1kUMus-5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjNmAdvGsoTpWpmbUtNwwrESuUsnixo2EzDqXr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPy6f4166V4Ru3kKH7XFRUt1n69IW-tufkKMdIP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNL6rdcy070A-Zrjq2nbWzmPXVD9dcOOkDNqxvu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><user_id>110700740490580721097< /user_id></record>

<review>I have twice ordered a box load of succulent cuttings to be shipped to me (30 cuttings each order). They were all really healthy when I got them, and I noticed that each order had a couple extra cuttings. I also ordered a gift container and a rosette succulent to be shipped directly to a friend, and that one looked awesome. I will probably order more in the future because the cuttings are such a great bargain, if you don't mind starting small and growing them up. (The larger plants on the website look really good too, but I have not yet ordered one of those.)< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPds8-sVkwDrhWzD63wMVHAZcFECMA5sXkFX_s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6uXoWQJouyDgn41NfTQHMvPFB-sRtywtSr8Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0t0r_aGmo5yj6OQL3WQwWx1GTPz_Bhg0twyc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

From their customer service being phenomenal before I ever even placed an order, to the quality and care exhibited with my delivery, to the volume and variety of succulents I received (more than I even ordered), I cannot possibly praise The Succulent Source enough. Every concern I might have had disappeared the moment I first asked questions over the phone. You can tell this family absolutely loves succulents, and it truly shows both in the way they communicate with customers, and when your order arrives. The only reason I haven't ordered more yet is because ALL the cuttings I received rooted, and some even broke off and rooted into their own plants, so although I only ordered 16 cuttings for only $15, I now have more than 25-30 succulents growing happily in my little wagon and I can't think of anywhere else to put more!! The value of what I received, plus the selection, and how healthy each was despite traveling from California all the way to PA.... I mean... Incredible! I will never buy succulents anywhere else!< /Review>

<text>I used The Succulent Source to make DIY centerpieces for my wedding.  They were incredibly helpful throughout the entire process, and I was very impressed how quickly they responded to email.  They gave great tips to help keep the succulents looking perfect the week leading up to the wedding (and way beyond - I still have many of them from August 2019).  Everything arrived in great shape and we had a ton of fun making the arrangements.  I highly recommend The Succulent Source for any size event.  The wedding was for 200 people, but we did two practice rounds before the big day.  Those orders were much smaller, and they still took the care to make sure things arrived on time and in perfect condition.< /text>< GmapID>

I used Succulent Source for the seating assignments at my wedding.  They we so cute and very affordable. More than a year and a half later some of our little succulents are still going strong (and this is coming from someone who kills every plant ever).  In addition to the amazing quality, it's so nice to work with a family-owned company. They were very reassuring that all 500 of my succulents would ship when I needed them too, even sending me personal emails for extra confirmation.  I would HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone.< /Text>

We have ordered from The Succulent Source twice. The first time we ordered was last summer. We bought a large collection of succulents to re-pot and share was favors for my sister's bridal shower. They shipped quickly and arrived in Michigan in perfect shape. When COVID quarantine started, we ordered one of the DIY kits with the cute critters. Again, everything arrived in perfect condition (this time to Florida). I would highly recommend purchasing from The Succulent Source. We've been very happy and will order again.</review>

<Review>We ordered several succulent's to make a corsage and boutonniere for my daughter's prom.  I am not a florist, but we were able to create some beautiful pieces.  We planted them afterwards and they are still alive today two and a half years later.  I would highly recommend their products.<//Review>< pictures>

For my daughter’s wedding we used the succulents in the white pail as the placecard holder and favor for each of the guests. The plants arrived perfectly and right on time. It was very easy to move them into the pails. We used small bamboo plant stakes off Amazon and had a graphic artist friend put all the names on the stakes. Everyone loved them! I highly recommend The Succulent Source!<//Text>

We gifted succulents to our daughter for Christmas.  She loved getting her box of cacti each month!  Each plant was different and unique.  They were packaged carefully with noodles, so every one of the plants were still thriving when we received them.  We love, and she loves, her cacti and succulents!  Thank you Succulent Source!< /review>

I purchased a bracelet for my daughter for her prom in 2019. I pre-ordered ample time ahead-it arrived beautifully and on time. What a UNIQUE and GORGEOUS piece! So many compliments! We were able to plant the succulents and use the bracelet alone-still beautiful! If you want a unique and beautiful corsage bracelet-shop here!!</Text>

<Review>5 months later, my plants from here are some of the healthiest and strongest in my collection! I'm particularly pleased with the Huernia as it's growing like crazy. It feels good to support a small business that is passionate and knowledgeable about the plants. I don't know where or how plants were taken care of at retail stores and it is usually 50/50 if it'll  even live. On top of that, the prices are great and plants were safe during shipping. I would highly recommend The Succulent Source to any of my friends who are also plant lovers or any who are interested in starting the hobby. As soon as I have more space to add new plants to my collection I will be a return customer. It is my Source for Succulents now and I think it will be yours too!</Review>< pics>

I ordered succulents for our wedding favors, and they turned out amazing. They shipped in perfect condition, just needed a little TLC (dusting off and added a little dirt). We did the burlap wrap right around the plastic container they came in. Would highly recommend the succulent source!!!</Review>

I made a purchase last year, and I needed it asap. The order can in on time. I was so happy that it only took 3 days for my package to arrive since I live in GA. The plants where neatly packaged and I even got an extra succulent just in case I needed it. I loved my shopping experience with them. Their website is super easy to navigate with. Will definitely purchase again in the future.<//Review>

I ordered succulents to use as favors about 10 days before a party and they arrived with time to spare. I also requested specific colors and they happily obliged.

Absolutely fantastic store! I had an amazing experience with them. I bought five succulents online, and I was a little nervous going into it because I had never bought plants online before and I was worried they might not do well in shipping, but when I got them they were packaged really well, and very healthy. Each succulent was unique and beautiful, and they are priced really well. :)<//review>

The Succulent Source is AMAZING!   The plants I received for a non-profit fundraising event were packaged with great care and arrived in excellent shape! I followed the directions and watered the plants and many of our donors who took home the centerpieces are STILL raving about the wonderful succulents- a year later!  I would 100% recommend this quality, family-owned business!</review>

Some time ago my daughter gave me the gift of a collection of succulents from The Succulents Source. The first package arrived promptly and all the plants were beautiful. Then I had the same joy with the next ones. Then my sister's birthday came and I gave her an aloe plant from TSS as a gift. Last week she told me that the plant is beautiful with flowers and has grown so much that she has divided it in several pots. This is the place fir succulents.< /review>

I bought some plants from The Succulent Source & as it was a gift & going to a very hot place the plants arrived in great shape. My daughter loves them. They also put instructions in with the plants, which was a very good idea. I have also sent the web site to my friend & would buy from this place again. Good people.</Review>

I have ordered from The Succulent Source a couple of times now--both for my business as a floral designer and also for personal use. Their plants arrived healthy, were priced competitively and were perfect for my needs. Not only that, their communication, delivery, and follow-up were great! Finally, I love that I can support a fellow small business owner.<//text>

Always receive the best quality plants and clippings for personal use at home as well as for work‐conference/tradeshow giveaways (the 2" succulents are always a crowd favorite!). They also have great gifts...always fun to send - recipients love them! I'm always excited to receive my Succulent Source packages! =)</text>

I was very happy with the quality and selection of plants I received from The Succulent Source. Their prices are great and you can often find discounts on Facebook. They have cuttings, leaves and full rooted plants to choose from. This is also a great place to go to if you just need cuttings for a craft or project. They offer many different shapes, sizes and colors of succulents and cactus. This is a great place to shop for the home gardener, or if you are looking for gifts, table decorations or bouquets. Shipping was fast and the plants were packed well.<//review>

I've purchased succulents for 2 different occasions from The Succulent Source and both times had no problem with the succulents I received. I used them as favors for my daughters baby shower and they were a big hit. Plus ad door prizes for her bridal shower everyone really enjoyed them.<//Review>

<rate>1<//rate><date>1600740646019</date><Review>This business does offer beautiful plants and prompt customer service.  However, the packaging in which they ship their products is toxic to the environment.  This is ironic since they make a living by selling plants.  The package I received was half plants and half Styrofoam peanuts.  Styrofoam is a petroleum-based product that is not biodegradable.  I received about 3 bags of it which will sit in a landfill.  I hope the bags do not break and release Styrofoam into the air, rivers, or oceans.  There are biodegradable and environmentally friendly options, but the Succulent Source advised they choose not to use them due to the cost.  This was very disappointing.  Had I known I was buying bags of Styrofoam I would not have made the purchase.  It appears that they are happy to make a living from selling plants but do not care about their role in polluting the environment outside their greenhouse.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

<Review>I would highly recommend ordering form the succulent source. We ordered from them for a wedding and rehearsal dinner.
We received everything in a timely manner and everything arrived perfectly.
They even included a few extras in case of damage.<//Review>< Time>

They were a wonderful addition to our decor.  The Succulent Source was a pleasure to work with-thank you for answering my questions and delivering as promised!!<//Text>

<Text>I love my lithods, the flowers are worth the wait; the story behind my plant was I broke my ankle and did all my shopping on line when I ran across The Succulent Source and purchased lithods; it's going on 3 yrs and I think this will be the year to see the flower.   The packaging was great; explained how to take care and be patient. Their selection is huge and I will be back to buy more. Thank you!< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I purchased some plants for my daughter’s dorm room at college. Everything arrived quickly and in excellent condition. My daughter loves her new room addition. I would definitely buy from the succulent source again< /review>

Great Service! The plants came as advertised well packaged as well! I let them get acclimated for about two weeks and then replanted them. They are very happy and growing very well!

Thank you very much!< /Review>

<text>I love The Succulent Source! I recommend purchasing from them because they have great customer service, excellent packaging, and beautiful plants. I am a succulent collector and I am in lots of succulent groups on Facebook. I always recommend them in the groups when people ask who to order from. I used the assorted cuttings and rosette cuttings to make a gorgeous wreath for outside. I am in the succulent of the month club and I have ordered many plants from them. I love the assorted 6 inch Echeveria. Great color and texture.</text><user>118125942365653429617<//user>< pictures>

<text>I used the Succulent Source succulents for a wedding in April, 2019. They arrived healthy, in great shape and ready to be worked into our decor and floral arrangements. The next time I need succulents for an event, I will absolutely come back to the Succulent Source again.< /text>< Response>

<Review>It has been a few months since I have received my order from Succulent Source. I think there was one little baby plant that was unhappy when I opened the box. I chose to not invest in a warmer for their trip to me so it could have gotten too cold. The rest of them seem to be happy and doing well enough. Overall positive experience and I would order again.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

This nursery is great! I ordered a cactus cutting. They did a wonderful job of carefully packaging it. And the cutting I received is beautiful as well. Very robust, and cut in a professional manner to minimize the area that needed to scarify. Highly recommended source (hehe) for cacti.< /text>

<Date>1600448587058</Date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>I ordered seven succulents to gift my husband on our "7year itch" anniversary on 21st June. Except that I managed to get my act together to order only by 16th June, by which time the system was showing the delivery date as 23rd June. I did put in the notes the special occasion, but I had mentally prepared myself for later delivery. Fortunately, the Succulent Source proved me wrong! It arrived well in advance (19th June) and we were both so pleasantly surprised - not just because of when it arrived, but 'what' arrived! The succulents were adorable and in great condition! Of course, there was some loose soil from the planters, but that is inevitable and completely excusable. We have since followed the clear instructions that came along: watered them well, and kept them at a place where they won't get direct sunlight. It's been a few months now, and they are all doing so well (except the Lithop that a stupid squirel took as its lunch!) Highly recommend these guys!< /text>< Pics>

< review>
We loved our wedding favor succulents! They arrived to us a week before the wedding in perfect condition. They were packaged well so that none got damaged during shipping. Not a single succulent was dead, or even on the verge of death. We got one of the variety packs and they were all so cute and different. Everyone told us after the wedding that they loved how unique our favor was and that they would actually use it! Our wedding was a couple of months ago now and so far everyone I have talked to since the wedding says their succulent is still alive a well! We could not be more grateful we found The Succulent Source. They deliver great quality products for an extremely reasonable price. Highly recommend!<//review>

Loved the succulents and cactus we received! They arrived in great shape, despite the carrier placing the box on its side when delivered, which rustled some of the soils around. Highly recommend this nursery!</text>

<review>We ordered 140 2” succulents as favors for our daughter’s wedding. Every single one, of several different varieties, were in excellent condition when they arrived, even after traveling from one coast to the other. The size of the plants was impressive, and I could swear that many of them grew noticeably by the time we wrapped the pots with Kraft paper about a week after they arrived. We could not have been more pleased.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>The Succulent Source is great! I have ordered from them multiple times and the plants always come in great shape and as described. Their plants are super healthy, and are grown and packaged with love. Their website has amazing variety, and I especially love that the plants are listed with their scientific names, for easy care and identification. They also give out care cards to help you keep your plant happy. Great prices too, as well as great customer service. Super amazing small family business!</text><gmapID>0x80db8bfedbe9cf6b:0xe405e97c24e9af22<//gmapID>< user_id>

This company is just a pleasure to do business with. They were easy to communicate with and they did exactly what they promised. We ordered succulents to use as favors at our daughter’s bridal shower. They arrived very healthy and right on time. The videos that show what to do when you receive them were awesome. They were a huge hit at the shower and really beautiful to display. I highly recommend this company!</Text>

I love The Succulent Source!! Not only do they have beautiful succulents, they also provide great customer service.  I refer everyone I know to them.  Fast shipping and my plants arrived in great shape.  As a matter of fact, I'm doing my daughter's wedding with succuclents and the care cards I made for each succulent has The Succulent Source web address for how to care for their plant.  Thanks for all you do.
Blessing to all of you!

The Succulent Source has always shipped me beautiful plants at reasonable prices. On the rare occasions when I've had problems with shipments, they always move quickly to rectify them, because customer satisfaction is a priority. They sell a wide variety of plants and they never hesitate to answer any questions you might have about particular species. They will also provide suggestions for you if you need succulents for particular projects. I love TSS and order new plants every year-I know that delivery will be fast and I will love what I receive. You can't go wrong with them!!!!</text>

Communication was ideal and the timing of the delivery was perfect.  The little plants are so cute.  They were a big part of our decorations for the shower, then the guests got to choose one to take home.  A great choice all around.</text>< pics>

The family at Succulent Source were so friendly and accommodating. I loved working with them and their response for always so quick. A few succulents didn’t travel well and they immediately replaced them at no extra cost. The succulents were the cutest and were a big hit at the bridesmaids luncheon.<//Text>

<Text>These succulents were amazing. We ordered about 100 as wedding favors. They came in great condition and right on time. It was so nice to be able to order them months in advance and have them show up a week before my event date.

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Love! Great place to get wedding party favors, we ordered about 70 small succulents. They came in perfect condition & they were super helpful on making sure they came on time for my wedding. I also ordered 3 clippings for my hair. They were just as perfect as the party favors! Highly recommend!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Ordered succulents for my wedding favors, they allowed me to put in the date of my wedding and shipped them in the appropriate time frame for the wedding. The succulents came in perfect condition, healthy and not a single plant was damaged and the price was great. I originally was going to get the succulents from a wholesaler through my florist and the price would have been $150 more then I spent throught The Succulent Source. I will rarely right a review on anything, but i was so pleased with this company, i wanted to share, in the hopes of helping someone else out!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Love!! I recently ordered some cuttings from the Succulent Source to add some new pretties to my collection, and it was the best decision I’ve made! My order arrived fast and the cuttings themselves were beautiful and perfect. Healthy plants and 100% recommended!</Review>

We ordered a San Pedro cactus almost a year ago. It arrived well protected and very healthy. We live in South Carolina so I was surprised after so many days in a box it was so healthy. I have it in my dining room and it is growing so fast you can almost watch it grow. My sons comment every  few weeks that they think it grew. I highly recommend the succulent source!</review>

<response>{'time': 1537310567372, 'text': 'Hi Rose, You did send a picture to us which shows freshly rinsed plants  In the picture, we do not see any damage or discoloration.  The succulents actually look very healthy.  The ones you circled have natural darker coloring in the center of the plants~like the sempervivums and the perle von nurnbergs are naturally purple in color, I do not see any with bruises.  We asked you to send another picture per the one you sent did not capture anything but healthy plants!  In addition, we did send about 3 emails post purchase with  very clear care instructions, we are sorry you did not get to those read prior to your receipt of the plants.  We sell our plants with a guarantee~ if they are unhealthy or broken we will always make it right.  We would have made sure you got replacements on time had you taken the time to send a picture with evidence of damage.   We just did not see that being the case with this order.   Also, succulents do not need to have a pot with drainage as long as you do not over water or ever water when wet~they will be fine in the pails with that instruction.  ;)      We wish you well.    Lora       (unfortunately, this will not let me attach your picture for all to see and judge)'}<//response><Text>Our succulents arrived a week before our event brown and bruised. We followed the instructions on the little business card that was enclosed. We notified the sellers right away and sent pictures.  They insisted they were just a little bit bruised, but then also said the pictures weren’t clear....At this point It wasn’t worth the aggravation to continue to send additional pictures or argue the fact...because I had a shower to plan. We followed the care instructions but by the time our event came I was too embarrassed to hand most of them out as favors, so we went and bought many new succulents from the local garden and center, and it was like night and day. A few things to point out: our succulents got stuck/delayed an extra day and it was during a time of excessive heat. Also FedEX did not take special care in delivering and we found the box on the porch on its side. We also found out later that the business card with instructions that was enclosed in the box, did not list full instructions. You will need to go online and read through all of their FAQs to get the info you need. Also beware that the decorative pails/pots that you can purchase do not have drainage. Succulents need drainage!!!
While the seller was always professional/nice in their communication, they just didn’t feel anything was wrong... and like I said, time was of the essence.  Even if they would have rectified things, the bottom line was that I still needed succulents in a hurry. We also made sure to tell everyone to replant their succulent into something with drainage when they got home.</Text><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Love this company. Their succulents and cacti I recieve are always in good condition when I recieve then and ship very fast! I think I’ve ordered from them three or four times and this last time I ordered a pretty good size cactus and it is now one of my favorite little babies.

Oh I was so disappointed in this place. I ordered succulents a week, slightly more, before my event. Assured they would be here in time before I left out of town. Got a message Friday, that they wouldn’t be delivered to my house until Saturday, after I left. Tried to change shipping to be held so maybe I could intercept it on the way out... didn’t work. The problem wasn’t all of this, it def threw a wrench in the plan and I hated it, but I contacted the company only to get Less than satisfactory customer service. I spent several emails back and forth basically “arguing” with them about how they arrived late, and how it was somehow my fault. I told them I wanted to send them back, and needed a refund. I was told I may or may not be refunded the total amount just depending how the shipment arrived back.. (which was never open!!) it has now been 2 weeks. The package has arrived, per my tracking number back, and no refund or answer if I will. The answer back has been “send us your tracking number, and we can check on it.” As a successful business owner myself, I would never treat my customers this way!<//Text>

{'time': 1548181267515, 'text': 'Hannah, the reason your package was delayed was because you changed the delivery address once the package had already been shipped directly with fedex.  YOUR actions led to your package delay.   We let you know this straight away and offered a partial refund despite it not being our fault.   We then were told if we gave you a full refund you would take your unfair review down.  We gave you a FULL refund and you did not hold up your end of the bargain.

The little tin buckets were super cute and everyone loved them as our wedding favors but unfortunately 70% of the plants died within the first month or two despite following all proper care instructions :(

They are pretty pricey (about $3/plant) for most of them to croak so soon.</Text>

<Response>{'time': 1515812582869, 'text': "Hi, Our policy is very, very clear.  If a plant arrives damaged, simply let us know quickly(and a picture really helps) and we'll address it quickly, we want all of our customers to be happy, whether their orders are just a few plants or 1000's.  We're also very clear via multiple emails during the order process that you should order a Heat Pack if you are expecting temps below 32 degrees.  Your plants arrived on the 28th of December and your low temp per Weather Wundergound was 14 degrees.  That's very cold!!   Your plants arrived two weeks ago yet you never contacted us about a plant arriving damaged, so we couldn't fix the problem.    You gave us a review on our website 6 hours ago, I just checked and your review is up and visible, just as Andrea said in her quick response to you earlier.  Please see link below.  If you scroll through any of our product reviews, you will find some orders/reviews that didn't meet our customers expectations as well as our own standards, but those are far and few between.  We truly try and make every customer happy.  We answer our phone 6 days a week, and we respond to emails 6 days a week.  We value our customers and make ourselves available above and beyond most companies, again, we're sorry you were not completely satisfied but we feel your review is very unfair.  Cheers Darren\nhttps://thesucculentsource.com/collections/succulent/products/assorted-succulent-gifts-wedding-favors"}< /Response>< text>
Originally, I gave them a 3/5 on their own website because one of the plants showed up half dead. Yet, when I wrote the review, they emailed  me and said they were sorry for how "so very unhappy"  I was, but it was my fault for not trying to get a refund. I explained that I didn't want to go through the process of trying to get a refund for a $5 plant, but I wanted other customers to know that a dead plant showing up was a possibility. As far as I know my previous review never ended up on their site, and when I mentioned this they said that they didn't stop my review and that they replied to it. Reviews should be made public and are not just about replies. Therefore, I am taking off another star and writing this one. Beware of their overly impressive reviews on their site.</text>

They arrived 1 month before the event date rather than 1 week as I expected after I entered my event date on the order. I did not get a notice before they shipped. When I notified them of their mistake (via email because they don’t answer or return calls), they had horrible customer service which included saying “I’m sorry you’re upset over such a minor issue” and proceeding to tell me to just water them and “they should be fine.”  In the future, I will stick to supporting my local nurseries.<//Review>

{'time': 1518385815458, 'text': 'Dear Kelsea:  We are truly sorry for any misunderstanding.  Please note, we responded to your email within 1 hour and 30 min.  And we also followed up later that evening and offered to talk on the phone. We have not yet experienced any glitches in our website with event dates and your order did not show a date.  You may have put a date in the system initially but if our program expires/times out, you\'ll need to re-enter that info when you complete the purchase.  We did in-fact email you the tracking # and let you know the pkg was shipping out (these automated emails are showing confirmed on our end).  If we had received a response from those, we certainly could have held your pkg. back.  In addition, we did offer for you to send the plants back and for us to reship at the right time and you responded "that would be silly".    We attempted to rectify the situation for you and we wish you well.'}< /resp>

The Bottle Shop is my local go to for any wines to booze and if they dont have it they will try their best to get it or get you something equally good if not better. They are super knowledgeable about everything they carry.</Text>

<text>After calling the first 9 liquor stores listed on google, I hit the jackpot!  The associate who answered the phone was both helpful and knowledgeable not to mention the fact that he spoke clear, unbroken English. He had the hard to find product that I was searching for and was more than pleasant when I showed up. Thanks guys, great job!<//text></record>

The first time I went there I was with my friends, and after I got some stuff I wanted I went to the counter and put the stuff on the desk and he said "A dollar fifty.". So I gave him two dollars. Then he says "A dollar fifty.". So I put another dollar down and he's just like "A dollar fifty." So then I remove the 2 bucks and give him two quarters. then he just takes the money I get my stuff. The customer service probably isn't always like this so I'm giving it a 2.</Text>

<text>Unit 10 car Alexander and Martinez thought they could violate a womans rights without due process. I witnessed a crime by police officers on you tube. Check out Kern County Transparency.  No excellence. Trying to charge her with interfering before evidence. Extortion by the police of Pasadena. Male police searching a woman without a emergency.</text>< pictures>

~ossession of oDen alcoholic beveraaes on city Streets of and sidewalks and olaces
bpen to public view then ordenance 9.36.060 no interior noise from 10 pm to 7 am.  Very disappointed as how I was treated by this officer of law.  If I can't count on the Pasadena police to feel save who can I count on?<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Had to pick up my daughter after a concert in Rose Bowl. A twenty minute ride took us three hours. Lack of police officers and direction to guide drivers to the parking lots was the main reason for the worst event organized in a city that hosts events on a regular basis. Real chaos. Drivers were going in circles with no direction. All we could see were barricades. A few officers that were present in the area were acting like robots with no sense of compassion as if the poor drivers (mostly parents picking up their kids) were criminals. Wonder who was the genius behind this mess. The young kids hired to guide the traffic didn't have the slightest clue about which streets the incoming traffic was supposed to use but they seemed to enjoy shining their flash lights. May be it is too much to ask, but I expected more cooperation and guidance from the police. Worst event as far as the traffic organization is concerned.</Review>

Worst police service. Racist police men especially officer Perez. They had no right to search and violate my friends privacy and rights. If my friends were white this situation wouldn't have happened. So be careful when in the city of Pasadena and be knowledgeable on your rights to make sure they are not violated.< /review>

<review>Very upset!  Went to huge Pasadena police department building at 4:30 pm Saturday and all the doors were locked. No access!!  It was about 100 degrees outside and we had to talk to someone over an intercom.  They said an officer might come out to talk to us somewhere between 10 min. and 2 hours.  We left. So much for being public servants.<//review>< rate>

A bunch of 1 star ratings.  Its hard to get good reviews when your giving people bad news one way or another.  Someone has to do it. Respect.</Text>

These guys keep our community clean. They are all very polite and respectful. All the women and men officers I've been in contact with over many years have been professional, courteous and show an amazing amount of patience and understanding with the citizens of this city. Most have become good friends. Thank you for all that you do for us!</review>

Been trying to make a report about domestic violence from my father, and I just get the run around. They were called to the hospital and they could not do a report because they could not enter the hospital. So they tell my husband for me to go to police station. I go after I get discharged and I am told to call the none  emergency number.</text>

Just watched a video of this police department violating rights of citizens during a traffic stop. They had no reason to physically remove the man from his car for a traffic violation. Illegal search and seizure unprofessional behavior.  I pray for those who live in this area.< /Text>

< review>
I've lived in Pasadena for years and i have never been so upset with law enforcement anywhere that i''ve lived before and i have lived a lot of places. Pasadena is a great place to live. however now i have to move because of the Pasadena P.D and how they harassed me and my fiance to the point where we had to move. i miss my home so very much. There was a lot of great memories there until the first time the Pasadena p.d crashed down our door for a probation check when we gave a report the day before about a minor crime that happened in our home that had nothing to do with us. All the cases were dismissed because they all were bad searches. and this was a matter of 3 months they raided 4 times FOUR times. Now my whole life has changed for the worse because of it. I'm depressed, my German Shepard has hot spots due to stress., and my fiance's career in Hollywood was very much jeopardized.
There was also another incident when i got pulled over and a male cop sexually harassed me and searched me and asked me if he looked in my bra would he find drugs. On top of that, stole a 1200 dollar brightening watch that was going to be a gift to my fiance.
Pasadena cops are dirty and corrupt and surely not to be trusted. if i were planning on moving to Pasadena and i'm on probation, i would definitely not even think twice!!
We are currently in the process of finding a good lawyer to sue the Pasadena P.D.< /review>

I am an independent professional actor and these officers have been very applaudfull and supportive of me... personally i feel that they do their job better than any other force in cali... and they deserve a star on the hollywood walk of fame allot more than the HDPD.... last time i was there there was people laying naked in the grass and i was laughing at those two poor lady officers who had to deal with it when i saw the look on their faces.... BAD BOYS BAD BOYS ,,,,, WHAT YA GONNA DOO!!!!.... WHAT YA GONNA DO WHEN THEY SEND two poor little female officers at you having to look at male privates and deal with crack heads :/........ these professional law enforcment officers have bigger fish to fry.... and be sure to remember their faces because they are also starting in my film "Dark Laughter"......<//Review>< pictures>

I have multiple witnesses.

The Pasadena P.D. front desk dispatch was INCREDIBLY RUDE, unprofessional, and condescending. She wouldn't give me her name, she refused to help me, and the officers were unhelpful and condescending. They all trivialized my concerns, they refused to acknowledge that I was assaulted, DESPITE THE FACT MY DAD IS A LAWYER, he told me that it is assault. The suspect is a menace and a frequent problem to people in the area, and nobody does anything about him.

The front desk dispatch and your  officers were unhelpful. I am outraged. I was assaulted, and nothing was done. You idiots won't let us carry guns, and yet you do nothing to help assault victims.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>They have some of the worst service I have ever experienced. I walked in and was tolled to leave and give the two cashiers a minute. I saw and heard them back talk other costumers as well. Always an issue when it comes to paying with cash and change. They always have one service or other not available, carwash ,gas pump or ect. Unfortunately a majority of the time the place is trashed they do not tend to the outside of the gas station even their trash is never locked and opened with homeless people rummaging through .You are better off going to just about any other gastation. At least you'll find a better selection of products and you'll definitely find better service.</Review><username>Alex Reyes</username>< Time>

<Review>Friendly attendant, but don't use the car wash. Paid $10 to have my car not dryed the first time because the air machine goes on before your car is finished washing. So I was given another voucher & went last night and my vehicle was still full of soap didn't rinse correctly & again no dryer NEVER AGAIN!!<//Review><Name>Rose Marie Aranda (Bee Charming)<//Name><user>115574123694621596113< /user></record>

<text>They said they take cash but cant give you correct change. They want you to donate your left over amount to some charity. If you cant give me correct change just say we cant expect cash. I don't mind donating to charity but when you force me to that is not donation.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Fire oven pizza, salads, etc. with fun flavor combos as well as traditional toppings available. Helpful and conscientious staff guided me to choose a delicious vegan pizza - spicy red thai curry with Follow Your Heart vegan cheese. The flavors of the cheese and curry combined to bring things to a new level. So good! Fun card games for the whole family while we waited were a nice touch. Reasonable prices. We'll be back!<//review>

All the pizzas are incredible. We particularly love the roasted duck pizza and the butter chicken pizza. If you're eating for two or more I would recommend the pow wow pack so you can share 4 different types of pizza.< /review>

<Review>Initially ordered pizza delivery from them and we were hooked. Now we gladly make the trip to their location. Every pizza we've tried so far we've thoroughly enjoyed. Our favorite so far is the roast duck pizza, but I can honestly say you can't go wrong with whichever one you choose. We even enjoyed their Greek salad, because it's rare to find one that's not plain and boring. It's become our go to place for local pizza.< /Review>< date>

It's a small place, but a cozy spot. A lot of other places nearby like the Steel Craft district - grab a drink, feel like a pizza, head on over to PowWow Pizza Co.

My wife and I had the Angkor and the Korean pizzas. Thr flavors on both were very delicious and very unique in their own right. The Angkor had lemon-grass beef on it, which isn't traditionally on pizza, yet the flavor combination was FANTASTIC! The Korean pizza boasted a bulgogi beef and was built on a scientific recipe for my specific taste buds. They have your traditional pizzas as well, cooking away in the fire oven, but why wouldn't you want to try something different? Something like a roasted duck pizza? Which is on my list next after I work off this small pizza I devoured on my own.

The prices are very reasonable, $7 for a small pizza and I even caught a beer (Angkor) for about $5. They also are a part of delivery services, so if you're looking to stay in, they got you covered. Friendly staff and fast service. Give it a shot!<//Review>

This place is a gem hidden (newly discovered by us) in the middle of Bixby Knolls. I tried the roasted duck with hoisin sauce on a thin crust (I think they only make thin crust).  The combination was spot on! Savory with just enough hint of sweetness. We will definitely come back and try the other signature dishes.< /Review>

<Text>Not the same as BELLAS pizza which was it before. Did not enjoy. It doesnt taste like American style pizza. It tastle like Asia pizza so if your looking for a pizza place that tastes like a normal pizzeria this is NOT the place. I dont reccomend it for people who want typical pizza.</Text><username>Syan Patel<//username><response>None</response><pictures>None</pictures><gmap_id>0x80dd334c1c42bf15:0xc3eade57861ae3dd< /gmap_id><date>1549237957075<//date>< rating>

<Text>Great place. It's a new location so I had to try. I eat Waba all the time. Food is awesome. This one is pleasant. Nice patio, good service and smiles. One thing that dropped a star was there was no lemon wedges being served at this location. All others serve them as a garnish for chicken meals or ice tea. And the jalapeno/carrot medley garnish is mostly jalapenos. Let's get lemon wedges in service and more carrots please. Thank you<//Text>< time>

I really hate to write this but want to warn others. My co worker and I were at the register ordering and we see a cockaroach crawling right by the registers. the cashiers looked at eachother in shock but didnt do anything about the roach.  We left couldnt eat there anymore. This location Warner and Bristol. The day i saw the cockaroach was 9/24/19 around 12pm lunch time.< /Text>

Love the food from Waba but the service I recieved was bad as I ordered a chicken bowl to go. When I got to work to eat I realized the chicken was undercooked. I called and asked for the manager which I just found out his name is Salvador. He would keep giving the phone call to the lady from the front counter who charged me. I am trying to let him know that it is not healthy to eat uncooked chicken. But he will only ignore the phone call. Looks like I will have to look into calling someone above him since it seems as he does not care, and does not want to handle the issues at his location.<//review>

I haven't needed gas for three months due to the pandemic, but I buy cigarettes there occasionally. Last time the cashier was on break, so I used the 5 minutes of wait time to wash my car windows. The cashier's are akways great!< /review>

<Text>They sold my wife diesel motor oil (Delo) when my wife asked for Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Under their guidance she put into the exhaust system on my 2015 GMC Duramax Pickup Truck motor oil.
It blew my motor. They should not be giving advice that relates to things they know nothing about. All they know how to do is sell gas and cigarettes. Stick to that you ignorant morons:(
We'll see you in court.<//Text>< pics>

Me and my lady stopped here for quick bite but let me tell you everything was hot fresh and so good. Perfect amount of seasoning and enough for two to eat off one plate. Highly recommend! Customer service very good as well!</Review>

<review>I have delivered for this spot several times, and it always smells good so I decided to try some for myself. Got the vegetable a la carte and pad thai with egg rolls. Would recommend the vegetable dish and egg rolls if you stop here, they have a lot of flavor. Aside from that, they are always on time with food for deliveries and everyone there is very quick and friendly :)</review>< Gmap_id>

I LOVE THIS THAI FOOD PLACE. I order it on door dash all the time and it’s ALWAYS delicious and fresh. So far I’ve tried the fried rice, pad Thai, orange chicken, tempura shrimp, egg rolls and some others. The orange chicken is SUPER GOOD it’s obviously made fresh and with real oranges it’s nice tangy and crispy. I don’t get the fake chicken feeling when I eat here like when I eat at other cheap Asian takeout places. Even though it’s cheap it’s really good and authentic. They also have a very good jasmine rice.</review>

Best service I've ever had at a restaurant. I was about to finish my smoothie(which was fantastic) and the waiter gave me water before I even asked, and was super on top of refilling it.

The food is incredible. The prices are $8.95 for a typical Thai plate and $14 for the Boonsee specials. I had the spicy salmon special and it was so good. Savory and full of flavor. The orange chicken is also really good, it's sweet. There was also a fantastic dessert, I forgot the name of it but it was coconut rice served with mangos.

Great place to come with friends or family. I will definitely be coming back and I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for Thai food or just great food.<//review>

<Date>1602562344950</Date><Rate>1</Rate><Review>GO TO LITTLE BUDDHA THAI KITCHEN in Eastvale, will never order from here again, yesterday we called in an order and then went directly to pick it up, she gave me a big paper bag, which was stapled closed on the top, with the printed itemized receipt stapled also, so i assumed that everything with in there, and i paid by debit and left a $5 tip since its been tough for many out there, so when we got home, we waited about 30mins, and started taking out the containers out of the bag and started serving our plates, about 10 mins into dinner, i thought how we ordered alot of food, but then realized oh wait, i dont see the chicken pad-thai, so i decided to call them before it got to late, (and it has happened before through doordash), we spoke with a lady and told them that they did t include our chicken pad thai, and she said oh it was in another bag, and the bag isnt here anymore, and my wife said while on speaker that she only gave me the one bag, it i was pretty fuming while hearing this, so i said aloud she only gave me the one bag, she never gave me 2 bags, and its like why would there be 7 dishes in one big full paperbag and then just the pad thai in another bag, so she says well someone must of taken it by accident, and i said out loud, well she never tried to even give me 2 bags, so she must of given it away before hand, then she said ok do you want to come back and  pick it up, and we said no, because it is about 15 mins from us she finally says she will refund us, then they called me about and hour or more later and the lady was nice and said that she was sorry, and that instead of charging us $59.54, she would charge us $40 something, so i figured it would be the price minus the pad-thai, and i said ok great thank you, yeah it was a big full bag and i noticed that the pad thai wasnt in there, and so i thought that would be it, but then i check my account today, and i see that they refunded me $5.82, its like wow really, so that means that they probably saw the $5.00 tip that i left and added that to the $5.82, to equal the price of the dish owed to me, but i guess not, instead of issuing me a full refund for the pad thai, they just added my $5.00 tip to the $5.82 that they refunded me, so thats pretty shady, i just thought that well maybe, just maybe, they would refund us the full amount, and not cash the $5 tip also, since they really didnt deserve the tip since they messed up the order, not us, and this isnt the first time, several months ago, i ordered from them through doordash, and they didnt include an item, and by the time we got the delivery they were closed, so when i tried to call then no one answered, and i had only used doordash a few times before hand, so i didnt know where the option was for forgotten item, so i didnt get my money back then also, so now i just wont go to them anymore, they disappointed us for the last time, and Little Buddha Thai Kitchen off Pats Ranch is actually a better quality food, less greasy and oily, they are so much better that we tried calling them first, but the line was busy, wish we would have kept trying, they probably would have gotten the order correct!! lol now</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

We drive a bit out of our way but it is worth it one hundred percent! Their food is great, I have tried a variety and everything is really good! My favorites are their pad Thai, spicy glass noodle, and pad see ew but their other dishes are really good. My husband is obsessed with their wings and spicy basil fried rice. When we come to pick up the food or eat in the restaurant the employees are always so nice. We are always glad we went there. Thank you!!!</Review>< pics>

<review>2 /10/2020  I ordered the Thai beef salad and I could tell the meat was not fresh and had re-heating grill marks on it. I was the first customer of the day and my food came out immediately. I didn't smell anything cooking. Lol.  Yeah, I was in the bathroom off and on for almost a full day. That sucked.

< Review>
We starting going here for the Crying Tiger dish. This was the only Thai Food location that we could find that offered the dish. We've discovered that almost every dish is exceptional over our 2 dozen + trips. On our most recent visit we tried the Pad Thai and my wife agreed it was the best we've had. It was well balanced without an over bearing amount of peanuts or peanut sauce as many locations are prone to doing.

Each of their curry dishes are consistently good and their massaman curry is very good.

If highly recommend a visit if you are in the area.</Review>

This is a local favorite for my husband and I.  Atmosphere is quite, food is excellent, staff is attentive.  Physical restaurant is a bit older, so if you want a super nice, upper class, atmosphere this would not be the place.  Prices are reasonable.  I highly recommend this place for dinner or take out.  They also have a nice lunch menu.<//Review>

This place was very very good when I first started going there I don't know what happened new chef or what but the food is not the same.  I ordered a seafood Dish One Time got sick as a dog but I believe in second chances went back sorry they did not redeem themselves so sorry to say that was my last time going but please feel free to stop by and make your own opinion maybe they just had two bad days< /Review>

The staff not very  attentive  to their  dining I customers, they seemed more focused  on the people picking up orders for grub hub,door dash,etc. We tried their pad thai and its was ok, their bbq beef ribs were delicious,  and their beef panang did not have a lot of taste.  I'm don't think we will ne going back.</Text>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I went to pick up an order and arrived around min before the order was supposed to be ready. They told me ten minutes, ok that’s fine. Then I kept seeing people come and pick up bigger orders after I got there. Ten minutes turned to forty five and every time I tried to ask them what was going on they would ignore me. Like I was invisible. Eventually I started getting stern and they told me they were working on it, it would be done soon. So I kept waiting. Again I would see people come in, show them the order on their phone and leave. THEN, the guy comes out and says someone already picked up the order. How? If I’ve seen you check everyone’s order confirmation everytime they pick someone up? “The order was picked up” even though I showed them the order confirmation they refused to remake it. Never again. Money and time down the drain< /review>

The food was mediocre. Too much rice in the fried rice, and the flavor is not that great. All their curries are spicy, so be aware. The drinks were also mediocre. Will not come back.<//text>

Panang curry, eggplant with tofu, massaman curry, and tom yum tofu were all excellent with authentic flavors. Staff/owners are very friendly and helpful also!  One time our Groupon wouldn't work because the site was down but they gave us credit for next time. Highly recommend!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< Review>
Good food. Their PAD THAI is really good.  You can tell if a Thai restaurant is good according to their Pad Thai.  I have gone to other Thai restaurants where this dish was too sweet and had too much sauce.  At Boonsee they make it just right.

Their Green Curry with eggplant and chicken is another of my favorite dishes.  I order at least once a week.

Friendly service and great food.  My favorite Thai restaurant and now they are open in Norco, YEA!!  I used to go to the one in Rancho Cucamonga, but this one is closer to me.< /Review>

I've eaten Thai food all over the United States, this is by far the best place I've been to. It's made fresh, the minute you order it. The Panang Curry was soooooo good. And you get a lot for a good price. Will definitely be coming back here. Oo and they deliver!</text>

<Date>1514657650670< /Date><Rate>4<//Rate><Review>I enjoy eating at this place. They also deliver when the food arrives its so hot and fresh! Their tom kah is yummy. My only complaint is to much meat. Last time I ordered it with tofu and it was great! Their pad Thai is yummy! Their pineapple fried rice is one of my favorites!!! Their pineapple curry is also super yummy! Their appetizers are also all yummy their golden tofu is always good. Sticky rice with mango is also very good. The only reason I gave them 4 stars and not 5 is their tv is kind of loud and I'm sick of every resturant having a tv. We are there to eat not watch tv! But that will not stop me from going here as its yummy local Thai food that delivers and is also just a short drive with comfortable booths and good service.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I've been on the biggest Thai binge lately and this place has totally come in handy lol

Not only are they one of the few places (other then pizza) that delivers food to the border of Eastvale ..... they happen to be cheap, fast and taste delicious.

I always get the prix king with beef and my girl always gets the pad Thai with beef and yellow curry .... it always comes to my door piping hot and tasting amazing.

Can't beat this place in the Norco/Eastvale area< /Text>

Obviously if you get the pad Thai or the pad sew eew you will enjoy it thoroughly. Very clean and the friendliest adorbs staff. I want to come back again and again to try everything the menu has to offer. Tell your friends about the best little Thai spot in Norco!< /Text>

Headed to the gym before the birds started chirping. I was a member at another gym for 20 years, unfortunately due to Covid they have closed permanently. Why did I choose AF? Open 24 hours, clean, great equipment, members have gym etiquette, parking available.  It is a little more pricey than other gyms but extremely worth it.  It feels great to be back. Thank you Jamie, Stephanie and Danny for your excellent customer service!< /review>< pictures>

The place and staff are awesome. Even if you don't have a personal trainer the general trainers are very supportive. All the equipment is cleaned and sanitized after each use. The ambiance and music made me feel enthusiastic. I got my body shaped here. The service was exceptional. Five-star service!< /review>

<Text>Good gym with all the equipment you need for any type of workout. I tend to do crossfit-esque exercises and so I appreciate that this gym has all the equipment and space needed for them. The gym is clean and 24 hours and so it makes missing the crowd a bit easier. Masks are mandatory at all times currently, but I'm unsure how well they enforce since I generally workout when there's no staff and the other members are following the mask mandate.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

They don't have a proper management team. I had a membership with other fitness centres never faced such kind of difficulties in cancelling membership.

I have my own travel agency and travel to LA several times a year for business and to visit family. This is the only gym I go to - not just because I’m a member at Anytime. I go because the equipment is first class, the staff friendly, the space clean, and there’s plenty of parking. Stephanie and the entire team to a fantastic job of creating a welcoming and relaxing atmosphere to pursue fitness goals.< /Text>

I called Anytime Glendale and spoke to Danny on the phone, who was very nice and accommodating. However, the next day when I went in to sign up for a trial, I received some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was asked to sit and wait while 3 employees sat around seemingly having a team meet of some sort. After 10 minutes, one of them brought over a liability sheet for me to fill out, which I did, and she told me it wouldnt be too long. 25 minutes later and I still hadn't been attended to despite them all being sat right next to me in the office. At this point I decided to leave. Horrible service! No business should ever make a potential client wait 35 minutes for no apparent reason! The gym itself looked pretty well kept and clean, and if it hadn't been for how I was treated I probably would have joined. Too bad.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The cost is expensive for sure. But after checking the place out I see the atmosphere is good. I gave the place a 1 star out of nothing and I regret it. The staff is friendly and the cardio machines are top notch which other gyms don’t have. I plan to get a membership soon. Sorry Anytime Fitness for the 1 star.< /review>

There are a lot of gyms in Glendale, but this is by far the best one!

1) Parking - What sets this gym apart is the excellent parking. They have their own private parking lot that's very accessible and convenient for members.  I used to have other gym memberships but found myself not going as often as I wanted because the parking was such a hassle.  Now, I just park, swipe my key fob, and just workout.

2) Clean - They have brand new equipment, a relaxing hydro massage room, clean restrooms with showers, and even towel service.  I see members wiping down and putting away the equipment all the time.

3) Great staff - I'm always greeted when I enter.

Even though it's smaller than other gyms, it's perfect for my needs.  I love coming to this gym!< /review>

This is the best Anytime I’ve ever been to, and I’ve been to a lot of them. I’ve been to others in the US, NZ, Australia, the UK. This place is spotless, really well equipped and has spectacular bathrooms. Well done! An added plus: other customers and the staff are delightful.< /review>

Awesome staff! New, clean gym that has everything you need. The group classroom was a great place to stretch and foam roll. The weight area was not crowded at all, no waiting for equipment, and the hydro-massage chair felt amazing for post workout recovery. Thanks Anytime Fitness, Glendale!</review>

This place makes working out in a gym fun again! And the parking lot is just steps from the front door, doesn't get better than that for a gym.

Top reasons why I'm recommending Anytime Fitness Glendale:

1) It's a brand new gym- the equipment is new, and everything is kept very clean by the staff. The bathrooms and showers are a pleasure to use, and I am a huge fan of the private shower (as opposed to shower stalls in a communal locker room.)

2) The gym is state of the art and impressive, but feels like a friendly neighborhood gym- the opposite of a huge gym with rows and rows of equipment to get lost in.
When I walk in I feel very comfortable, and everything feels accessible.

3) The "Studio" room is awesome- the projection screen for workout and yoga videos is my current favorite thing to use. I start and end my workouts in there with a cardio/stretching video, and end with yoga. Looking forward to trying all the different videos available.

4) Fantastic equipment- the cardio machines are new, with good software, touch screens, and connectivity to your phone. Big fan of the stair climber.
They have a water rowing machine!
I also like that they have heavy rope and jump boxes to vary the whole body workout.

5) The staff are very friendly, but not creepy or aggressive- they feel available to you when needed, which is great. I'm planning on asking about developing a personalized workout regimen soon...

Really excited to be a member and taking my fitness to the next level here!</text>

Nice clean place and not too busy. Would definitely recommend as a good alternative to slummy places like LA Fitness and 24 hour fitness<//text>

TL;DR Version
- Amazing and friendly staff
- Workout equipment is all new (as of 5/9/18)
- Private showers and towel service provided
- Mature crowd and intimate, boutique experience
- Fair pricing with included amenities and services

This is by far the best gym experience I've had compared to many other established gyms such as 24 Hour and LA Fitness. I've been going here for a couple of months now and have always had the same consistent and positive experience since I've signed on as a member.

The staff is very friendly, greeting me every time I visit. They are always willing to help and try to get to know all of their usual gym comers. I received a free fitness consultation on my first day and a 30 day workout plan to get my fitness routine going. It's been several months and the staff still check up on me to see how I am progressing with my fitness journey. Kudos to the team for creating such a positive environment.

I've been coming to this gym pretty consistently since I've started and its nice to see that there is available parking no matter what time I go during the day. They have a private lot, which sometimes gets full, but not to a point where you cannot accommodate yourself to find a spot near the facility.

Compared to other Anytime Fitness gym facilities, this is definitely on the newer side. I would even consider it one of their flagship facilities. They have plenty of amenities such as towel service, private room showers, free Wi-Fi (the good kind), and a workout studio featuring virtual classroom sessions projected onto a wall. The equipment is all new; there are even some equipment in this location that I do not find at other Anytime Fitness facilities. Other features include a heart rate monitoring system that is broadcasted onto dedicated TVs to help you get a strenuous workout.

The gym itself is on the smaller side in comparison to other established gyms such as 24 Hour and LA Fitness. However, that has not really affected my experience at the gym. I actually like the smaller boutique feel, giving it a more intimate experience. Pricing is on the higher side (as of this writing, I currently pay $45/month with an annual renewal), but the price is justified with all the amenities and services I receive from the gym. Members must be 18 or older, allowing for a more mature crowd that will keep equipment racked and the facilities clean.

The gym is staffed during the weekday (9AM-7PM as of this writing). Saturday's, the staff leaves early at 3PM; Sunday's are not staffed at all. If you plan to workout when it is not staffed, I recommend bringing in your own sweat towel. The clean leftover towels provided during unstaffed hours tend to get used quickly. Gym members can enter anytime using the key fob they received upon sign up. I've visited the gym during the early hours of the morning and have had no issues entering/exiting the facility.

Overall, I highly recommend this gym to anyone looking for a more boutique, personalized experience with fair pricing and amazing staff. It's always been a pleasure working out at this location and is considered my home gym for the foreseeable future. Kudos again to the Anytime Fitness team for creating such an amazing environment for all to enjoy.<//text>

The first time I came I was told that I owed $900, when it should have been $20. I didn't have time to deal with the issue then, and maybe couldn't have anyway if I'd tried, so that delayed a scan I needed almost 2 weeks.

The second visit was fine. The woman working on front was sleepy and not super friendly (understandable because it was 7:30am), but helpful enough. The rest of the staff was nice enough, given the early hour.

The results were read quickly. Thanks for that.<//Text>

<Text>I had a mid day 1 pm appointment and arrived early to check in. The front desk staff were friendly, courteous and professional. It was a busy day apparently and appointments were backed up. I waited almost an hour to be called in for my procedure. It would have been good if I was updated on the wait time. No one kept me informed until I asked about 50 minutes into the wait and the response was “you should be up soon”. I just expect people who made appointments should be seen at the appointment time or shortly thereafter. If not, I should have been informed about the delay. The staff who handled my procedure was friendly and professional. It’s nice having the parking garage very close by. I will go back again. Chalking this up to an unusually busy day. Hopefully my next experience will be better.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Casper Wong</user_name><Review>I went to the front desk to check in at 8:45 am but didn’t have to fill anything out since I already checked in online beforehand for my 9 am appointment. Wait until 9 am and someone called my name to do my CT scan with contrast for the lungs. The person who called me in (Randy) was performing my CT scan. Someone named Laz also assisted me and the scan took about 10 minutes or so. Completed and left in less than 30 minutes. The staff was fast, efficient, and polite. Simple and cheaper than other places. If you need a CT scan, I’d recommend this location.< /Review>< rate>

I had tried to use another imaging place in San Francisco  2 days in a row. They only did walk-ins for x-rays. After being turned away day 1 and then told "4 hour wait" on day 2, I jumped online and found SimonMed. Confirmed they took my insurance, and popped in. I was in and out in 15 minutes! Super friendly, efficient, fast! Only a 10 min drive from my house, and free parking!<//Text>

I have visited two other times (one pre- and one during COVID) where I had no issues. I believe that they were down one technician the day I went, so the check in line was extremely slow and out the door with only one person doing checkin. I had checked in online but wanted to be sure I was fully checked in — good thing because they asked for my ID even though I uploaded it to the site.

I waited in the hallway for 30 minutes before I got to check in and there were only 3 people ahead of me. Then I waited another 35 minutes to be seen. The staff is awesome. The mammogram tech was great. But the wait was terrible and I wish they explained why it was so long and how long my estimated wait would be because the longer I waited I started to think they forgot about me.

My appointment was Friday at 12:45 pm. I overheard the checkin staff tell someone it is worse between 2 and 5 pm. Good to know. I’d come here again for convenience but pick another day/time.</review>< Resp>

The ultra sound technician was fabulous and very compassionate and helpful.

The front intake clerk was  inexperienced.  She demanded a credit card payment or refused me service even though though treatment is preapproved.  I called SimonMed billing and they confirmed that there was not an outstanding balance.  I will opt out and go to Lab Corp from now on.

<Text>I had to get a contrast ct abdominal/pelvic scan. My insurance required precertification. One local hospital took far too many days to process it and then only got partial approval because they separated the precert as two procedures.

Another hospital would do the scan without precert but was charging me $2000 up front as out of network and I would be responsible for whatever the insurance wouldn't cover!!!

Total at Simon Med would be less than $1900 if my insurance doesn't pay. Simon has the best prices nearby. My only strike is that it would be better if they had a precertification department that customers could contact. They are in my ppo network so I'm hopeful that my insurance takes care of the bill.

I was able to get a Daly City appointment within two days of calling Simon Med. The online registration process and paperwork profile were a breeze and made for a very quick check in. Waiting room seating is limited due to covid social distancing. The staff is professional and the facility clean. I had to arrive an hour early to drink the contrast solution in my car. I returned at my appointment time and was called in within 5 minutes. Total time for the setup and scan was about 15 minutes then I was on my way home.

I'm very pleased with this experience and strongly recommend Simon Med!</Text>< response>

<text>There was quite a bit of a wait to get ultrasound.  Not sure if there are few stations for ultrasounds but it was 30 min wait.  Tech took over a 100 different pics.  I am not sure if she was new, but she ended up getting my shirt soaking wet with ointment used to take pics.  She also seemed to be taking and retaking the pics.  This may have been required per my doctor, however it took another 30 minutes to take pics.</text><Rate>3<//Rate><UserId.>107132686949194349668< /UserId.>< Pictures>

The techs at this imaging site were absolutely incredible. Professional and kindness were noticed  right away, but then I had to wait after closing for an Uber that didn't cost 500$ and they waited with me without any qualm or even a bat of an eye.. then made sure I got into to the Uber safely because it was so late. I definitely recommend this imaging center.< /review>

I realize we are all challenged with this pandemic and making everyone’s health a priority, but there were mixed messages upon arrival.  There were two signs at the door which could read “do not enter, you will be called!”  There is always a level of anxiety when having health tests done, so to be battling other patients over your place in line was a challenge.  As asked by your online and followed up by a text from your company, I  completed the on-line form, I was under the impression that all I would have to do is “check-in.”  I sent personal information that was requested on-line and there was no record of my information at the location.  The person at the desk said something I did not want to hear, as a matter of fact I asked him not to say it, “I don’t know where that information goes!”  I would be happy to hear from you that my personal information was not compromised.  All got better with the MRI technician, she was professional, knew her stuff, and was very accommodating.  She made what could have been an overall bad experience a better one.  I will say the original lady that helped me at the counter said she normally doesn’t work at the front desk.  I look forward to hearing from you that my information was not compromised.  I will chalk this up to the pandemic.< /review>

I made an appointment at SimonMed imaging for bone density screening last month. I did all the requirements that they asked of me. My appointment was at 10am on March 4 at the Daly City location. At 8:30am I received a text to check in when I arrive at the facility so I went for my scheduled appointment. I checked in on my phone and I was instructed to proceed to the reception area. When I talked to the receptionist, he told me that they no longer do the bone density screening in the Daly City location and the closest one is in San Francisco. Why did they not notify ahead of time that there is no bone density screening done in this location instead of wasting my time and effort to make my appointment? This is not the only time my appointment was canceled. When I had an appointment for a mammogram last year, they forgot to tell me that the mammogram equipment was broken and that they had to cancel my appointment when I arrived at the facility. Simon Med Imaging/Health Diagnostics is the worst radiology provider I’ve ever used. I go there only because my insurance carrier has a contract with them. Otherwise I would rather go somewhere else.<//review>

This place is a JOKE BESIDES THE FACT THAT I WAITED OVER AN HOUR AND HALF & still asked why they haven’t called me. LIED to me and saying my schedule appointment was at
Another time when I made the appointment & they called me the day before to confirm. DO NOT GO HERE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.<//Review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I will never get a scan from here again. I’d first get robocalls from SimonMed saying I can walk in for X-rays every day or so for 2 weeks. I show up to the San Rafael location only to have the receptionist be incredibly rude and unhelpful. She goes to say that they don’t do walk-ins or X-rays, which is false. She didn’t try to assist, just was vile to me despite being in the wrong. There goes 1 hour of my time wasted with poor treatment.

Then, I spend 20 minutes filling out their forms online to schedule an appointment. A couple days before my scheduled appointment, I received a call from someone actually competent telling me that their San Rafael office doesn’t have strong enough magnets to get a good picture for my scan. Just wow. I ask where I can get this done and she said it would be one of the other locations. I had her find out which one so my time wouldn’t be completely wasted again, as this is not listed anywhere online and their scheduling system isn’t sophisticated enough to know which office can service which type of scan. She called me right back and confirmed that only the Daly City location can do the MRE, since it’s a complicated scan. She got that scheduled for me. Yet another hour wasted.

Meanwhile, my GI appointments have now been delayed - delaying my CARE and treatment - for weeks due to all of these issues.

Finally we get to the day of the scan. I was told to arrive an hour before to drink the prep liquid. They just had me sit there for 45 minutes. What’s even the point of arriving early? I finally get called in for the scan, 1 hour past the original appointment time at 9:15. As I’m getting the hospital gown to change into, I’m asked if I have any metal in my body. As I’d filled out in the copious forms beforehand, I have a belly button piercing. I was told I’d have to take it out. Why am I finding this out right before?! Then I struggle to take out my piercing, which I haven’t taken out in 8+ years. After weeks of waiting, I didn’t want to not be able to go through with this due to my piercing. One of the x-ray technicians gave me some pliers and that did the trick. Absolutely wild. All in all, I spent 3 hours total there.

After the hours of my time wasted, delays and rude treatment, I’d recommend never using SimonMed if you can help it.</review>< Pics>

When there and the place was deserted. No receptionist no way to talk to anyone. Once I did speak to the tech (who was doing both jobs) he could not find my paperwork that I had filled out online. He asked me to fill out the paperwork again. I got there at 15 min before my appointment, the tech said 45 minutes later that he could serve me now. I figured I had wasted enough of my time there and left. Save yourself some grief and aggravation and go someplace else!</Text>

This place has problem with their schedulers. I called the scheduling phone number on my doctor’s authorization for bone density scan. The scheduler scheduled me an 8 am appointment at 1180 post st. I did the pre check-in online the day before, but when I got there, they said they do not do Bone density scan in Northern California, then they should not check for Nue Med on the back of the authorization form. So I called the scheduling again to schedule a  DEXA appoint at 455 Hickey blvd, I got an appt for Monday at 4 pm. When I got there for my appt, they said they do not do DEXA on Monday and reschedule me for Wednesday at 9:30 am. I finally got DEXA done on Wednesday after going their facilities for 3 times. This is the worst company I have experienced. They must improve their communications between their facilities and their Schedulers.< /Text>

<review>I was given an appointment for 8pm on 7/21/20 with an arrival time of 7:30pm. However, I was not told that the Daly City building was locked at 6pm and another entrance was available. I arrived on time and stood outside wondering if i was in the wrong place. After calling in, I was directed to the after hour entrance. My treatment inside was welcoming, calming and reassuring. Omar and Mei were professional, efficient and made me comfortable for my MRI. Thank you for this opportunity to express my experience. Be well and stay safe.

I've been trying for three weeks to get an appointment. I scheduled one online but their system sent me to a location that doesn't do the procedure I need, which I found out only when I arrived for my appointment. I wasted PTO because of that. I've called their number more than ten times and always get a message saying my call cannot be processed due to a system error. I tried their online chat and was cut off three times. I don't know how SimonMed stays in business with customer service like this.< /review>

<Review>My experience with SimonMed was very positive. Appointment went as scheduled.
One thing I would ask that they improve on is their answering service. It took numerous calls to schedule an appointment as they seemed to have many issues not being able to have someone answer the phone and I needed to keep calling with the same message to call back.
Another problem is that they’ll say to call back during business hours but they don’t let you know what they are.</Review><rating>5</rating>< Name>

SimonMed Imaging canceled my appointment 3 separate times. First time they called the day before to notify me.  The second cancellation, I received a text the morning of. And this last cancellation I was again notified by text the morning of. All 3 times due to "the tech is unavailable for your exam with us today." Terrible management.</review>

<Review>This place is the pits. It's dirty with stained carpeting and hair stuck on chair seats from other patient's. My biggest frustration was that they never sent me my MRI report or followed up, after I faxed the release form 4 times, wrote the doctor whom to release the records to on my intake forms, and called at least 15-20 times, leaving messages with each call. Beyond ridiculous! And, better yet, when I finally recieved the report, it was written up for the WRONG FOOT. Did the radiologist even look at my MRI when she wrote up the report. Guess what, still haven't received my correct MRI report, after numerous requests. This place SUCKS!< /Review>< pictures>

Called to reschedule due to illness, kept getting ‘system down’ . Tried 12 times since the Friday before appt. Also never received a reminder at which time I would have been able to speak to someone.
Every appt has some sort of issue.
Very disappointing.</review>

There was a lot of confusion with the scheduling as I did the online request, and again on the phone (after not getting a response 3 days later). But once it was sorted out, it was all fine. The actual appointment itself went smoothly and I was in and out within 40 mins.<//review>

<review>Really nice staff super friendly. I would of gave them 5 stars but locks on locker are not cleaned so you are carrying a dirty key change that the person before you used. The changing area is sharred . I do not see it being wiped down. Bring your wipes to wipe down bench to sit if you need to sit while dressing and undressing. Many people waiting over 8 but it was as spaced out as you can be for a small office. The gentleman at the front desk was so kind he let me wait in my car until it was my turn. I have to pre exsisting conditions and also care for my parents. So I need to be mindful of where I go.< /review><Response>{'time': 1597415483807, 'text': 'Thank you for the review.'}< /Response></record></dataset><record>

This review is in comparison to my PCP and OB Gyn office visits during the pandemic. I don’t think SimonMed does a good job of ensuring the safety of patients. There was no one to greet patients to ensure they were all wearing masks and sanitizing their hands before entering the facilities. You have to ask for sanitizer that’s kept behind the front desk with the reps as it wasn’t available to use. You can tell they overbooked appointments as there were 6 patients in the waiting room and another 6 or so waiting in the hallway right outside the elevators. I had to wait almost 20 minutes past my scheduled appointment. The equipment was new and the exam rooms are fine—hence the 2 stars. The waiting area feels dirty and unsanitary, which is a concern as we’re in a surge for the pandemic. I wouldn’t be surprised if this office is a source of spreading the disease. I hope the health department asks them to take corrective actions to properly space out appointments and staff adequately to manage the entrance and all ask patients to sanitize their hands before entry, which is the procedure at other medical offices. This place treats patients like a factory to jam out the most amount of tests and profits.</Text>

<Review>Well, the technician was nice but several things happened that raised my concern. Even though there were two rooms for patients to wait, and masks were required, the rooms were packed! And several people were very sick! There was a lot of coughing! I couldn't get far enough away. You should not have let that happen. Secondly, I came in for a neck catscan. The technician first thought he was doing my hip. Then he thought it was a chest catscan. Luckily I had the paperwork from the doctor with me. What's up with that?<//Review>< user>

First, I want to offer a five star review for the technician and the actual imaging process that I experienced. The technician was very professional and was courteous and helping me get set up to do the scan for an MRI.
I want to leave one star for the fact that I saw a different technician walking around the reception area frequently and also in the area where the scans are done without a mask. Rather, she had a mask below her nose and often also not covering her mouth. This is unacceptable in a healthcare setting In this time of increasing Covid infections in the bay area. It made me very uncomfortable and I was glad to have my mask on. If she ended up being the technician that was going to work with me I would have raised this as an issue and spoken to the supervisor.
The waiting area was very dirty the walls were marked up from chairs being pushed up against it and the carpeting had multiple dark stains that appeared to have been there for a very long time. The waiting area was a one star experience.< /Text>

I posted in all right review the first time I went. There was some small issues but overlooked them.this time I went in lady checked me and made me wait five minutes while she was busy typing, then after a half an hour I was told to drink a liquid they didn't tell me that I'd have to wait for another hour before they'd call me in. When I finally called in I needed a pillow they didn't have one they gave me a bunch of gowns to put my arm on. When they put the IV in me it clogged they tried to flush it and it still didn't seem right but they continued. Procedure was over they took the IV out put a Band-Aid on. I got up and within 30 seconds blood was gushing all over the place the whole floor look like someone had been massacred in less than a minute. I stood by the door and called for help three times before someone came,then the gentleman that acknowledged me his only concern was are you saying it's our fault?I mean I was light-headed and dizzy at least they could have offered me some orange juice or something they just left me there.and if ever anyone's had a vein that bleeds there was literally looks like somebody got killed in that room in less than a minute. I would never have any imaging done there where they have to insert an IV. Please go somewhere else<//Review>

<Review>Twice got turned away by SF Post Street location due to ultrasound machine malfunction, I decided to try out Daly City. Parking was easy, waiting area was clean, check-in was pretty straight forward. Was told to check in 15 minutes early at 7:45AM and I didn't have to wait long and got called in at 8AM. Tech was friendly and professional. The whole process took 30 minutes. Will definitely go back for imaging needs.

Update: Decided to return for CT and mammogram. Rep on the phone was very nice and set up both appointments on the same day 5/10/21, and also arranged it close together to save me time and hassle. After all, the CT needs 4-hour fasting prior.

4 days before 5/10, I got a text instructing me to reschedule mammogram. When I called back, no answer. Since mammogram appt is easier to manage, I was fine with it. After fasting early morning at 8:30am, 3 hours before the CT, they texted me claiming no technician would be there to administer contrast. I called SimonMed to confirm the cancellation and reschedule. After a long long wait I got someone on the phone. She read the same note about the cancellation, put me on hold and not long I was disconnected. I called back and finally someone answered. He was nice and rescheduled me, but not on a Thursday which is my day off. The rescheduled appt is a backup plan. SimonMed failed me a few times. My day off was wasted. As soon as I called my clinic they reached out to UCSF for me and all documents and appointments set up within a week.

SimonMed's quality of service is good, ONLY if you actually attend the appointment and the equipment is in working order. To play safe, I'm sticking with UCSF.</Review>< Pictures>

I was very pleased with my visit, during these trying times with the COVID-19 I approached the reception desk, the staff greeted me, handed me paperwork to fill out, had clean & used pens on the desk along with hand sanitizer. The gentleman told me they are running a little late, he said he would call me on my cell and I could wait outside if I wanted. I was pleased with his concern because sitting to long is a problem for me.  The waiting room had one other person,  clean and proper spacing. The tech  came out shortly afterwards. she was kind, courteous and was concerned about the pain I was experiencing in my neck before, during and after the MRI. Thank you simon imaging , job well done</Text>

They have evening & weekend hours and they got me an appointment quickly when they finally got the authorization after I  called them. I attempted to make an appointment on the phone & they said I had to have the authorization faxed over to the location I was going to get my MRI done at. I had my drs office fax it over, only to find out that it takes at least 3 hours for the authorization to show up in the system. I made an appointment for that evening, thinking the authorization would surely be in the system & the prompt said they would call me back but they never did. So basically I had to be very assertive to get my appointment. The MRI equipment seemed to be very old. I have had an MRI at county a few years ago & their machine was very high tech. I didn’t feel as claustrophobic as in the machine at this place. The tech was nice enough but the gown was ill-fitting and I had a difficult time getting it on. The nice thing is they have a dressing room with lockers and a key. You can bring key into exam room with you. Also, when the tech positioned me, she didn’t tell me I could lay my arm down flat & so I was uncomfortable for the procedure. It’s the little details that make for a good vs not-so good experience. Overall I didn’t like the experience but who likes getting an MRI?  I would go somewhere else next time where they have a newer machine that’s larger so as not to feel so claustrophobic. Another off-putting point is that the bathroom smelled like urine. It looked clean but when a health care facility bathroom smells, it makes a person feel like perhaps the whole facility is unsanitary.<//Review>

Been sitting in the lobby for over an hour and a half from when I was told to arrive. Patients have priorities in their life and wasting peoples time because you can’t schedule properly is a poor and disrespectful way to treat clients.
This is after they never called to schedule my appointment after a week of having my referral despite saying it was the protocol to call three times.
Will not return.
2 hours now. Still have not gotten my mri. Terrible.</review>

First, I’d like to offer feedback in regards to the technical aspect of this venue. The technical staff was very helpful, very accommodating, very helpful. The equipment for CT scans, apparently, were brand new, so that was really impressive.  First, I’d like to offer feedback in regards to the technical aspect of this venue. The technical staff was very helpful, very accommodating, very helpful. The technician I worked with in particular, was very knowledgeable, and really put me at ease prior to my procedure. Thank you Alex!
The reception staff, though, was a mixed bag. Cynthia was very professional and courteous when she reconfirmed my appointment the day before  and also when I came to pick up my images and report. However, on the morning of my procedure, the reception desk was somewhat unprofessional. In the process of checking me in, they offered me little  acknowledgment,  no instruction  about the paperwork I needed to complete ( they just handed me the paperwork on a clipboard), virtually no eye contact, and they were busy talking amongst themselves about personal matters. For a medical establishment, this is not  acceptable.</review>

My shoulder hurt because of the angle that i was laying at. Guy gave me water and checked in. Professional layout in the office space as well as the changing rooms with lockers and whatnot.
Careful with getting to the office. I was locked in the stairwell for a good 10 minutes before I could get to floor 2. The furthest East stairwell is a trap so be weary. Take the main East lobby or the west lobby to make it there on time.
Overall pretty okay experience. Just something that had to be done. L wrist and R thumb MRI.< /text>

Scheduling  an appoinment was easy and the scheduler was very courteous.

On the day of the appointment, registration was smooth. There’s a bit of a waiting time to be called in for the procedure, but the wait was pleasant.

There was also a little delay to get the procedure started, but the technician kept us appraised of reason for the delay and how much wait is anticipated.

Communication is important to us and the staff did a great job of this!

I will definitely recommend this office if I knew of someone needing an MRI procedure.

Thank you for the excellent service.</Text>

<text>Friendly, efficient and professional service.  I had an MRI on my knee, and only my lower half needed to enter the tube.  I was comfortable and able to relax.  Office staff @ Hickey Blvd in SSF fabulous.  I would like to see SimonMed nationwide remove their single use plastic cups from their drinking fountains and switch to a compostable alternative.  I’ve contacted their corporate office in regards to this, so hopefully they will respond!</text>< pictures>

Very nice staff.  Appointment was on time; excellent imaging tech--very professional, performed mammogram and bone density exam, with no delays.  Everyone in the Daly City lab seemed to know what they were doing--a pleasant experience!

The girls at the desk were so friendly and helpful. They quickly helped me with the paperwork. I completed it and was called in early by the technician 👩‍🔧 She was very nice and made me feel very comfortable. She was so good it only took 15 minutes when They told me it would take 30! I will go back for all my imaging in the future. Wonderful customer service.<//review>

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a nice young lady at the front desk. The technician who did my MRI was nice as well however I wasn’t happy with the long wait. As soon as I got there which I arrived 1 hour before my appt to do paperwork I was told they were running 1-1.5 hour late. A call prior would have been nice so I didn’t have to kill 1 hour of my time. I just couldn’t see how they were running late when they just opened? Overall, the people I interacted with were pleasant I have no complaints about that. The wait time was however frustrating.< /review>

I called to schedule a CT scan on 06/22/2020, as referred by Hill Physicians. The receptionist had a condescending tone and I told her she had a rude attitude, and that I was not interested in using their office as a result. Poor customer service.</Review>

<Review>Shady billing practice. They asked for my insurance card and then said “there’s a deductible.” I asked “is it not covered by insurance?” And then they said “yes it is but you haven’t paid your deductible for the year yet.” Now it turns out they were out of network for my insurance. But they never mentioned it. If they had, I would have gone somewhere else. Service is fine but either double check that they’re in network with your insurance or avoid this place! Shady.<//Review>< pictures>

The appointment desk person was not kind  and professional . They schedule the time and can not keep appointment time . Reschedule our appointment 2 time and they lost the paper we submit at the time of appointment. Wasting our time and refill the form for the appointment. Not considering of patient’s time and mind. Very unhappy experience at this SimonMed imaging center! Need improvement at front desk personal attitude and professionally handle with people come to this center!!!< /Text>

<review>Good price and great staff.  Subtracted one star because the check in paperwork is rather onerous.  They need to make their forms available to download, so their patients can fill them out before coming in.<//review>< user>

< review>
I made the appointment two weeks in advance for abdomen and pelvic with and without contrast and at no point did the operator tell me that was impossible. I went to my appointment on time at the Los Gatos location and at no point anytime there did they tell me that that was impossible. I was halfway through my appointment when their machine broke. How does an MRI facility not have a working MRI? I will say they did quickly get me another appointment the next morning for their Daly City location and told me they would absolutely complete my MRI's and my doctor would have them in a timely manner. I get to my appointment in Daly City right on time where they told me that the technician refused to do the MRI because the images would not line up. At no point prior to this moment was that ever an issue. They spent about thirty minutes going back and forth with the technician while I called my doctor to complain to them as to why they even sent me to Simonmed when they are clearly incapable of doing my MRI. The doctor said we could just do the pelvic with and without contrast just to get my MRI done in time for my surgery. Furhermore, they charged me for the visit in Daly City when they said nothing about charging me in advance in the Los Gatos location even though I have a PPO and they are in network. All in all, a terrible experience at Simonmed. No communication to me in advance about what was even possible to do in one appointment and I had to go to two different locations just to have a working MRI machine. Will never return to Simonmed and I hope others don't waste their time going to Simonmed.< /review>

They took the time to confirm with my insurance carrier that an MRI scan was covered 100% after saying I owed approximately $750. Front desk staff was friendly. Technicians were also welcoming. Waiting room and facilities were clean. Location had plenty of parking.</review>

I had a great experience at Simon Imaging. I had an emergency situation and was told by my Dr. to get an ultrasound immediately. It being late in the day I called Simon Imaging for the soonest appt. I could get. They got me in the next morning. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The wait was probably 20 min but to be expected as it was packed with patients. All for different services. So don’t be discouraged if you have an appt. your handled first as they do take walk ins for X-rays. I had a wonderful experience. My tech was very sweet and attentive as well as informative. I would def come back if needed. Pleasant experience all the way around.<//text>

The receptionist was soo nice and friendly. She even tried to accomodate me to get an earlier scan as I  came quite early.
The person who did the scan was also very friendly and did  everything very professionally and fast. He said only 6 min. I am sorry I don't know his name but I want to say THANK YOU for the excellent service.< /Text>

<time>1548810917607<//time><rating>3<//rating><review>I had an appointment scheduled at 7 AM and was told to arrive at 6:30 AM. I received a confirmation call the day before. I arrived at the garage at 6:20 (it is not very easy to find the entrance) and checked in at 6:25. Finally at about 7 the receptionist told me that the person doing the scan was late. At about 7:15 two employees hurried through the lobby, coming to work. At about 7:30 the person doing my scan came out and said he had to run the machine to perform QC. The procedure got underway at about 8. The technician was very nice and apologetic about the delay. He claimed there was a scheduling error.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1548870292058, 'text': 'Hello Gini, we are sorry to hear that your visit was less than satisfactory.

<Review>I didn’t have to wait for long to get my MRI done at this place. The receptionist was polite and got me registered in no time and the technician came out greeted me and got me into the MRI room right away. All was done in just 20 mins. I was very pleased and would recommend this place to anyone.< /Review></record>

< review>
Worst service ever. Couldn’t get my order right when scheduled. Showed up and telling I need to make another appointment for my foot. After I talked to the girl on the phone and told her I have the order the Dr gave me and what boxes I check off. Also I am a large person and told them so. I need either and open mri or a large mri machine. They scheduled me to a office that has neither. Asked me to make another appointment. Yes I will make another appointment with a different imaging place.< /review>

<text>While your employees were courteous & efficient upon arrival for my appointment, I did have issues with the lack of communication from when my Dr placed the order & when I had to contact your office to schedule my appointment. I needed to have an additional image request which my Dr’s office informed your service on Weds & my appointment was Sat. When I arrived no one had contacted my insurance company to get pre approval for the additional MRI & I had to return on Monday & fortunately I phoned before I left my house as my insurance still has not be contacted for approval. Your communication needs improvement.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Went to the office on 10/15 . Ask for my ID and health card but scanner not working and was told by the receptionist to filled up the form and she’ll give me back my stuff after. I saw her left maybe for lunch or break. Technician called me inside but never got my ID and health card back. After done I totally forgot about it but ask the counter different receptionist  if I need to do something else. Before I get a response they were just talking .Was told I’m done. Week passed by no call from the office. Just found out last 10/22 that I did not get my ID and health card back. When I call back they said they don’t have them. Big hassle to me and receptionist need some  training in customer service. Hopefully some actions will be done on this matter<//Review>< Pics>

There was no effort made to make sure I was comfortable... room was very cold and I had to ask for blankets.. told the heater was “broken. “ and the entire scan took 15 minutes!! Have had several knee MRIs in the past but never one that finished so quickly. The tech was abrupt, just wanted to get the scan done. Will never go back ! Hope I don’t have to repeat due to poor quality.< /text>< userid>

Love the Staff !

The wait for my MRI appointment was incredibly long
I’ve taken my mom here and the wait time to be seen was awful as well
That might be my only complaint<//Text>

Only had to go here once but I'll never visit again as long as I have another option.

I called them for an appointment after my doctor verified that they are in-network for our insurance. I got an appointment for Date X. I called them to confirm the costs but the person on the phone told me the insurance doesn't cover the test and it's going to be $X. I was confused and asked them to cancel the appointment. I called my insurance and they confirmed that the test is covered 100%. I called these guys back. First, they told me the appointment for date X hadn't been cancelled :/. and they also said it's not covered. They asked me to hold and talk to finance people. I waited for like 15 mins to talk to them. They agreed it's covered 100% and forwarded back to the appointment people. I changed my appointment to date Y when I was told to come at 3.45pm and drink lots of water 1 hour before coming to keep the bladder full.

We arrived with plenty of time to spare. The reception lady informed the appointment is actually for 4pm - why didn't anyone tell me over the phone about this? Usually you'd here "this is the appt time but please come 15 mins early", specially when they're asking me to hold my bladder full. Then they asked for ID which I didn't have on me - they wouldn't allow the test without it. They never asked me to bring the ID!? Fine, I said and drove back home and got my ID still arriving before 4pm. Now they told me the appointment was changed to 4.15pm!? Having drank lots of water my bladder was about to burst.. Fine, I said, as I was handed the forms to fill out - which they could have easily handed me when I arrived the first time!? Fine, I said filled up the form. After waiting till 4.10, I asked about how long it's gonna be - this is the first time my form was actually sent inside to the lab folks! The lab person then came out and said I didn't even need to hold my bladder since the test doesn't require it!?

What the hell guys, get your act together!</Text>

The nurse called me 10 minutes before the appointment about the camera problem
when I am literally in the building. The camera was down the whole day, but only called me 10 minutes before the appointment. The service in the front desk is not wonderful either. The guy had to help the new staff and let me wait when he was helping the new staff. That’s not professional :-(<//review>

Had to share a dressing room with members of the opposite sex. It’s uncomfortable enough to be undressed wearing a flimsy gown.
Cold room in the imaging room.
Image person was not very personable or informative. Seems like that part is rushed to make money.</text>

<text>Front desk acknowledged me as i waited to be registered.

However as my name was called the male tech called me for my turn he announced to the room “beverly... there’s a problem” TO THE WHOLE ROOM!!!  He could have just called my name and spoke to me privately about the “PROBLEM”.  I felt very rushed about resolving this “problem” and felt all protocol was thrown out.  They rushed me in without verifying my ID and insurance info before getting the MRI. I had to call my other  doctor to resolve the “problem” NOT A WELCOMING EXPERIENCE BEFORE ENTERING THE MRI MACHINE.

MRI Tech was great and had great bedside manners. So I’ll give them 3 stars thanks to him.

“Problem” was resolved and<//text>< name>

<Review>Tried multiple sites last week to get a xray. Which you can not schedule. Mountain  view had no xray tech, call out. I called, central scheduling, no way to contact the site directly, on the way to Redwood City said tech was there. Got to Redwood City no tech on that day. Attempted to go to Los Gatos, no opening  for xray and you can't schedule anything. Finally the next week made it to Daily City office. Very friendly, quick xray but did not get correct xray needed by my doctor. Concerning for an Imagining company.< /Review>< Rating>

<text>Pushed my appt back an hour bc their MRI tech didn’t show up and they had no backup. Never bothered to mention that the price of service had doubled from last year’s promo pricing. CHECK THE PRICE before you come here. Many other places around are cheaper and better, or not worse.

UPDATE: re the autoreply below, I’m not going to spend more time trying to help you. If your concern is sincere and not social media PR, you can reach out to me directly. You have my contact info.<//text>< pictures>

The receptionist called to see if I was still coming. As my luck would have it,  I was running behind because I had been lost for 15 minutes on foot and my phone was dying.  She explained how to find the location and opened the door:  she thought she was going to have to come find me. Just the thought was awesome! I told her i needed a bathroom and she allowed me to do that before check in.  I told her about my dying phone and she charged it for me. When my appointment was over,  because I told her I came from Oakland on public transportation, she had summoned a taxi to get bew back to bart! I LOVE THIS PLACE< /text>

When I called to make an appt, the scheduler was distracted and unfriendly. No one told me that I would need to remove my wedding rings or watch for my MRI, but I figured it was my knee, so...  Nope. Had to wrench off my never-removed rings and watch and lock these valuables in a gym locker in an open changing room. Would’ve been so easy to remove them at home and safer to leave them there!! Plus the street address is a large building with another business name displayed & only a small side sign that states SimonMed Imaging. Had to do a U-turn twice til I found it, then parked and walked to the lobby to see a paper sign taped to the door that said ‘Sorry for the inconvenience, please park on the lower level to access SimonMed’. How hard would it be to tell patients to park and enter on the lower level when they schedule? Finally the receptionist was on her phone, didn’t greet me or look at me and just handed me a clipboard. Cheaper than getting my MRI at Sutter health, but a crummy experience. The Walmart of MRIs.< /Text>

< review>
This is by far the worst medical facility I've ever been to. After I registered, the receptionist forgot I was there so I went and asked after waiting for over an hour when I would be going in and she said she didn't even know I was there. Then when I went to get my x-ray, the technician forgot to give me the protective apron. I had to remind him. The last time I went there, they had a substitute x-ray tech who didn't know how to use their system or even have the most basic computer skills. He was trying to delete something and didn't know the keyboard had a delete key. I swear, this is what he actually said to me: "How do I make the words disappear?" Do not go to this place. If someone offers you an x-ray or MRI that's a two-hour drive away, or go to this awful place, take the two-hour drive.< /review>

<Date>1541614355173<//Date><text>Worst experience with a medical provider. My appointment was at 3 pm, but they did not tell me that was the early arrival time for paperwork- my scan time was actually 330. Of course I arrived early for paper work so I got there at 230. I waited until 4 before I checked back at reception and they told me they were running late but it would only be 15 more minutes. I then came back to check at 415 and they said any minute. They finally came to get me at 445, a full 2 hours after I arrived. I also watched an old, infirm woman wait for an hour before being told that the x ray tech had actually left, and that they just forgot to tell her.</text></record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Very good experience, highly recommend!!

- before I went, I checked the reviews and find out the main problem is deal with payment. So I well prepared before I went. I called on last Wed and got an appointment Friday(yesterday). I received my approval letter from my insurance company and brought it with me. Receptionist don't need it and just asked for my ID and ins card.
- Receptionist are very nice and helpful :
The receptionist(forgot to ask her name) was nice and explained to me when I had questions from the forms, when I finished the first page, she took it and process first so I was called not even I finished completing all forms.
I want to get a copy of my MRI and I forgot to mention yesterday when I left so I went back this morning and I was lucky that they are open. Although their office shows closed on Saturday but they open for patients with appointment. Receptionist Cindy was very nice to burn the CD right away for me.
- Technican Mike was very nice and gentle. He    answered any questions that I asked. Now I know the difference between a normal MRI and an open MRI. If people don't feel comfortable to get into a closed MRI, they can choose the open one but it will be at least double the time. My coworker told me that  his whole MRI appointment took nearly 1-1/2 to 2hrs but it only took me 40mins. 1.5T might be 10-15 mins longer than 3T machine depend on what part of the body so 3T is the fastest, heehee...
- very convenience to change to another location. This company is a group, I make a simple call and changed my appointment from San Francisco to Daly City and I don't need to give my insurance info again.
- feel comfortable, although they don't have music to listen but with double ear plugs, put into my ears and add a headset ear plug outside, it cuts down a lot of noise. Of course you can still hear it, but I just treated it as different types of music rymthum. With the blanklet totally cover me, it makes me feel very comfortable and relax, so time go fast.
- very easy parking, they are located at the same building of AAA with a huge free parking lot.

Thanks SimonMed Imaging/Daly City!<//Text>< pictures>

If there was 0 instead of 1 for the rating, I would have no doubt to put 0. My appointment was scheduled at 9:30am. I arrived at 9am to register. It took them 1 hour 40 minuets to process the registration which is totally unacceptable. The exam was delayed by more than an hour due to their unprofessionalism. As consequence, I missed my scheduled meeting.<//Review>

<Text>I showed up 20 minutes early for a 6:45am appointment (ie I walked through the door before the person who was suppose to be seen before me showed up!) and so I was seen 10 minutes late as I had to wait for the late person. Pretty harsh for such an early appointment.< /Text>< time>
