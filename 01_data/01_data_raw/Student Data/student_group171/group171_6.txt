< Review>
This place is the bomb! I've been going to Baja Fish Tacos for 15 years now. I remember when I first started going here, I just remember telling my buddy that "this food was so good." We wanted to go every day during lunch! Even going just in the recent days I've noticed that their food hasn't changed quality or freshness. It is still just as good as the first day I went. Good customer service too, at this location.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Great place to stop for lunch or dinner. My son and I stopped here for lunch. I ordered the shrimp bowl and tortilla soup. The food was made to order and did not take long to arrive. We sat outside on a warn sunny day and had a great lunch. The tortilla soup was some of the best I have ever had, excellent. The employees were friendly and helpful. We both enjoyed our lunch. Highly recommend.<//Review>< Pictures>

I've been here a number of times. The food is consistently tasty and I'm addicted to the rice that they have there. Shout-out to Mario who took my order last time I was there. It's always such a treat when I encounter someone who wants to make sure the service you receive is top notch. 🌟 Thank you so much! Fantastic experience all around.<//text>

<text>Simply my favorite restaurant of all-time. I could literally eat their every day. If you like shrimp you must have their shrimp tacos. Salsa bar is the best around. Guacamole is on point. Great service and it may sound weird but something about their black beans and rice together with some salsa is so good.</text>< pics>

<Text>First time here was looking forward to some great tacos, we ordered 2 grilled fish tacos and 2 Ensenada  fish tacos, got our food home, no lemon no salsa with our order! Just dry plain boring tacos. Has to be the worst Mexican fish tacos we ever had.  4.5 stars way overrated.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80dce989a04cdfa3:0x24ee618863b7a7b7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Wow, for $4.25 I got a "green salad" with avocado, pinto beans and rice that was a meal in itself. The Pico De Gallo from the salsa bar, cilantro and spicy onions were perfect on top and mixed in. I haven't tried anything else YET but by the looks of how crowded this place was on a Saturday night, I know it'll be one excellent thing after another. Many locals there. A family type atmosphere, kind and helpful employees, big tv's playing sports games...a true gem. I'll be headed here after my church service down the street from now on!</review>

The garden salad and Ensenada fish tacos are a weekly dinner choice for my husband and me, sometimes twice a week, at least 5 years now, likely way more.

Salad is pretty large with a variety of lettuces, cherry tomatoes, onion, corn, avocado and tortilla strips if you like. The fish portion per taco is generous, 3 good size battered strips in two soft tasty corn tortillas. I split mine into 2 tacos, one fish strip each and top them with parts of the salad including an avocado slice in each and have the final fish strip in the salad. Soooooo goood</Text>

I love Baja Fish Tacos and have been going to various locations for over 10 years. The quality and the consistency of the food is always the same. No matter how busy this place gets you always get your food reasonably quick.  They have a very good salsa bar. Their shrimp burrito and shrimp nachos are a couple of my favorite things to order. Be aware that the portions are very big. Their combo plates are too much for one person. You can share a main dish and grab an appetizer.<//review>

I got to say this place is surprisingly awesome. Food is excellent even the rice and beans are freaking awesome. Quality Meats decent prices, and TVs to watch the games. The only thing I wish they'd do differently is to give small sides of chips. As it is you can only buy chips and guac if you want chips. Great salsa bar too.< /Text>

This is one of my favorite Mexican food places around. The chicken burrito is bomb. Great beans and rice and the salsa are all great! The red salsa is really hot and can make you sweat but man it is good!! They have the best guacamole I have had from any restaurant! Its is seasoned perfectly and helps cool your mouth after eat all that hot salsa! It is unfortunately kind of pricey for the type of food it is and I wish they would lower there prices a bit. I get the burrito combo and chips and salsa and it cost me almost $16... just too much for what it is. But the food is great!<//review>

The shrimp tacos are beyond amazing at this place. Whether you like Ensenada Style fish tacos or grilled fish tacos they will be fantastic.

Pay attention to your receipt!!! They always over charge. The receipt does not specify what your ordered, just the total. Do the math. Plus the kids working there do not provide good service. The crew that was there before were much friendlier and had great costumer service.< /review>

Accidentally rated this a three star somehow, glad I caught it. Great food at expected prices. Staff could be friendlier to truly earn a five star, but as long as the food is this good I'll be back again and again and can't see rating it as anything else without a negative experience.</review>

Visit for lunch every once in a while. Quality establishment with healthy, reasonably priced options. The portions are fairly large and there is a salsa and hot pepper bar. Their hot sauce isn't hot compared to most hot salsas but there are jalapeños available if you are so daring. Sitting outside for lunch is a nice option and there are TVs inside if you want to catch some sports.

Alcohol is served here.< /Review>

<Review>Delicious, but the "extra $$$" for shrimp is way over priced. $5.75 just to add shrimp for the salad.... Sure they give you a lot of shrimp, and it is delicious... But they certainly do make you pay for it. Not the kind of place I would typically spend $19 on a salad at.< /Review>< pictures>

<user_name>Nathan Ochoa</user_name><Review>After completing a local bike ride, my family and I were looking for a place to eat. After a few moments on deciding where we could eat we chose to check this place out.

Walking in your greeted with a big open floor plan and a few steps in the door you are greeted with a menu. I would highly recommend the Blackened Fish Burrito. With fresh crisp lettuce, tons of avocado (enough to to make Chiptole patrons jealous), and fresh salsa. It was a perfect meal and will come back for how delicious and friendly their staff were.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Excellent fish and other Mexican style meats. Baja Fish tacos like the name suggests specializes in Baja style tacos. My favorite is the Ensenada style, as they are breaded and topped with cabbage and Baja sauce.
Baja Fish also serves chicken and steak tacos and burritos. Their plates are served with either pinto or black beans and white rice. The salsa bar is also very good, they serve three different fresh salsas and pico. Try the pickled onions with spice, they they are great toppings.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dce989a04cdfa3:0x24ee618863b7a7b7<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>A little expensive for as simple as the food is.  My carne asada burrito tasted a little fishy and plain white rice is boring.  Our experience was a little disappointing for Mexican food.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Solid food. Been here many times. Great grilled or beer battered fish tacos. Grab some limes from the salsa bar to make them better.<//review>

<Review>Pretty much you can't go wrong with any menu item, it's all great! The salsa bar is awesome, with the salsa verde my favorite. Always ask for a side of their special Baja Sauce for its great om everything especially if you mix equal parts with the verde. Enjoy!</Review>< Pictures>

Over hyped & overpriced. The food is decent if they manage to get your order correct (twice now they haven't).  For me $15. for a burrito, chips and a drink is too steep.  Wahoo's, tacos & company or Olemendi's are better all around and for less $$ and better service.
Not sure what gets them 4 stars on Google & Yelp when there are better options close by.< /Text>

Great Mexican food, clean restaurant, friendly help. The carne asada is delicious, as are the enchiladas! Busy on Sundays after the local church is released, but not a bad wait. 4 stars only because they need more seating area.< /Review>

<text>If you like fish tacos, this is the place. The blackened fish taco plate comes with one or two tacos, rice and choice of white or black beans. The blackened fish tacos can't be beat. Sizeable portion of fish in each taco. The tomitillo hot sauce is the best. Other things we have had here are the chicken quesadilla and the cheese nachos, both also excellent. Staff is very friendly. Service quick. Restaurant always clean. Highly recommend.< /text>< pictures>

This place has some pretty good Ensenada style fish tacos. The times I've been here I've only tried the Ensenada fish tacos and the charbroiled fish tacos, both are good but Ensenada ones are best. My friends also enjoy the burritos and the enchiladas.<//Text>

It's good, fast service. Table cleaning could be better during busy times, sometime hard to find a clean table.<//Review>

I really like the carne asada here.  The ingredients always taste fresh and they are generous with their portions for the price.  My kids like the rice.  They have made errors with my order a couple of times when I've gotten take out.<//Review>

I highly recommend the carne asada.  Baja Fish Tacos is a chain restaurant.  The food is absolutely delicious, and I wish I knew the secret of their white rice because it is amazing (and it’s just white rice!).  My daughter says, “I love the quesadilla!”  5 stars for you BFT.  Keep up the good work.</review>

Good place for Mexican food, and one of the best places to go for taste. However, the prices are a little high considering what you can get at other places< /review>

<text>Had an easy welcoming application process with service rep Daniel Perez out of Modesto. He addressed all questions promptly and allayed much dreaded concern over the sr22 insurance process.  Highly recommended and sure to walk you through the labyrinth of insurance concerns.

I've been a loyal customer with Daniel Perez for many years now. He has given me the cheapest quotes I can find year after year. Becuase honestly I just want to drive and I can always upgrade later. And everything was almost all digital so no huge paperwork and I have my policy in my phone whenever I need it. Would highly recommend going here but ask for Daniel.</Review>

<review>I won't to send a shout out to Ms. Ellie,
Thank you for helping me with updating my policy.
I was recently in a car accident that totalled out my car, I need to remove and add a car and Ellie took car of that for me.

To my surprise this was Ellie and I second time working together, both times she was professional and respectful.

Thank you!</review>< time>

<Text>Very pleasant experience. Was immediately greeted upon arrival. Gabriel helped me within minutes of my arrival and was extremely helpful. I was shown multiple policies and found the one that was right for me and in my budget. I would highly recommend them. Be sure to ask for Gabriel or Carlos they will get you the best policy for you.</Text><userid>110072450567074616213< /userid><pictures>None<//pictures><Gmap_id>0x80905389f55384e1:0x59b46d7505488996<//Gmap_id><name>Omar Martinez<//name>< time>

Carlos
Once again he did over a tremendous work with helping me get my dmv back on track! He always gives me his un divided attention and great manager in this location.   I’m not sure if he was trained or just a natural at what he does</Review>

I came down to DMV to deal with a suspension placed on my 4Runner...I get to the kiosk, and BOOM! Kiosk instructs me to provide auto insurance. I step outside, wondering where I how I can make that happen. Luckily, DMV has neighbors I need, like Cost-U-Less Insurance. Ellie was polite, professional, and courteous. I was in and out faster than a Thanos snap. My experiece with C.U.L. and  Ellie was a positive one and I would recommend this insurance company to family, friends and customers.</Review>

Hi, I want to thank Carlos as he was so wonderful assisting me on a new policy as he saved me $71/month and almost $800/year. The customer service experience was amazing as there need to be more representatives like him who cares about their customers. From start to finish, my experience rating is 20 :-) I highly recommend this place!< /text>

I have never left a review on a service I received, but the experience I had with Monique Rodriguez was amazing. She was so personable and the process to get my insurance was easy and way less complicated than all the other insurance companies I spoke with made it. Definitely going to refer everyone here!

Sara at Cost U Less was amazing! She made the process of establishing our insurance so easy. I called her in a pinch and it was quick and painless. Her customer service and people skills were great and we appreciate her help. We will refer our family and friends to her for sure. Thank you Sara.< /review>

<text>Carlos helped me out, I needed car insurance at a great price, after talking to many insurance companies and not getting what I was looking for, I found Carlos online and he was able to give me exactly what I was looking for at a great price and he was able to get my registration suspension from Dmv removed within minutes and I did not have to wait in line at the Dmv for hours.  If you need great insurance, with great customer service at a great price,  call Carlos and the Cost U Less Insurance team in Modesto,Ca<//text>< Pictures>

Came to Cost U Less insurance because they had the best price in town after calling everywhere! It's very convenient that they are able to shop for you and find the best price out there. Sara Suarez was very helpful, explained everything to me, and made it so easy to understand. If you need a free quote or need insurance give Sara a call and she will make everything so easy and stress free for you. Thank you Sara! ❤️<//Text>

Staff is abit hit or miss. Its either you have an easy experience or you have someone who gives you attitude. They make you fill out all these electronic forms and when you want to cancel they waste your time by having you call time after time. My advice is to just go straight to the company you're insured by and talk to them directly and not waste your tine with this third part stuff.<//Review>

Cost U Less has a great atmosphere and I was greeted as soon as I walked into the door. Isaiah Daniel was very helpful in getting me exactly what I need and for a lost cost too! I would definitely recommend him. He is polite and made getting insurance a quick and easy process.</text>

<Review>I wrote a positive review after the owner practically made me do it after signing the papers however after that little trick I am now editing my comment to reflect the truth which is that they scammed me by lying to me that there won't be a fee if I cancel my policy however I got charged for one and I have opened a case with them. It was very manipulative and sketchy the way they went about it. Slimy office. Beware< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Isaac wiggs is the best guy to go to. He is an awesome sales man and great at customer service. He got me the best price on insurance and made me feel comfortable and confident going through this company for insurance. I wouldn't go any other place now that I've been here. I would recommend highly to go through Isaac espically if you are looking for good insurance and a great experience.<//Text>< Pics>

These guys are a scam! After paying almost $200 in person and after they automatically take another $200 from my checking account, they cancel my policy after only 1 month and tell me ill have to pay more to reinstate coverage. Then after speaking to them about getting a refund, they say "call Western General, we're a separate company and have nothing to do with them". Crooks! PLEASE AVOID THESE THIEVES SO THE SAME DOESNT HAPPEN TO YOU!!!</Review>

I followed my agent Josh from the Standiford office to the one by the DMV because he does such a great job! Amazing service, I insured mine and my wife's car for a super low monthly payment, and the entire atmosphere was warm and friendly, couldn't recommend this office, or this agent any more!! Fantastic job Cost-U-Less!!!</Text>

Carlos vieira has great costomer service didnt leave me waiting long at al and was very social wile paying my bill thank you for your kindness. Also i just realized that a review i thought posted didnt post for Sara...i seen her today you should have called me on it lol. Any ways i had goten quotes from other company's for sr22 so i can have my license back but the quotes were horrible so i gave up went to costuless and was getting regular liability under my girls name so the one times dont pull me over for no insurence. Wile Sara was helping me i told her about my luck and as she set up my girls liability for me she had asked if she can just try to se wat she can do with the sr22 and so i can be insured as well with my girl and make it possible to get my license back so hey wat did i have to lose so she did wat professionals do and made magic now i got my sr22 only had to pay haf down cus thats al i can afford and i pay 10 dolars less monthly then i did befor with jus my girls insurence for me and my girl with sr22. I wanna say thank you to both of you for your extra patience,time and inteligence soo much you two are awesome!!<//Text>

Monique is worth waiting for if u go and there is a line wait for her to start your new policy!!!  she hustles hard to find the insurance to fit your needs and budget, she has helped me with my insurance and my dad with his, both times we recived AWSOME SERVICE 😊 verry proffesional and answered all my dads questions no matter how repetitive . She took her time finding us an insurance to fit our budget. She is very HONEST  and is a good quality in an insurance broker. Her priority is her customer.. She is also bilingual.</review>

<Text>Was totally shocked to find out my last insurance agent from progressive was charging me $140/month. They lied and said no insurance company in the area would let me get an SR22 without coverage. I was naive enough to go for it as I had just moved to that area. I cancelled my plan due to discrepancies after my previous agent’s lack of sense to mail my SR22 to DMV cost me my license and a job.

I was helped by Gabriel Munoz in Modesto, CA and he worked out a plan that only cost me $21ish/month for my SR22, pulled some strings to workout the best payment method and processed all my paperwork immediately. I walked into DMV 2 days later and they had already received everything electronically but Gabriel sent me the info just Incase. I had a lot of questions and he was very patient and helpful with me and my lack of understanding how to fill out paperwork.

I would recommend Cost-U-Less to anyone and everyone and if you live near the Modesto area or want a policy over the phone like myself, ask for Gabriel Munoz. 5 stars for great customer service by the agent, speed and unbeatable prices.

Cost-u-less is a horrible place to do business. Everyone I delt with was fully incompetent & they did not accept resposibility for their own actions. For a whole year they had me signed up under non-owners insurance after, the fact that I walked in verbally explained that I needed the basic insurance and they guy verbally responded that we were in agreement and he printed out a whole book where I was to sign in agreement to what I came in for. They messed up my insurance, then blamed me because apparently I must be crazy to want a non-owners insurance on a car that I own. The manager Carlos was not accountable or responsible. He pawned me off onto a young lady named Cheyenne and he tried to blame her. I guess he felt she could not defend herself. William had a charming personality but all he cared about was getting his $300 brokers fee which he lied to me and said I could make paymentson it. That was a flat out lie.  I was left broke for the month that I started the policy because although, he verbally said I could pay it in payments the paperwork he had me sign was one lump sum. I got a phone call every month saying my policy was going to be cancelled even though, I had automatic ebt set up! It was a total nightmare. I felt like I was dealing with loan sharks that were willing to and could not wait to come to your home to break your legs. I do not know why they take notes if they are not going to bother to read them. I hate this company because I had to do their job for them and I was constantly harrased. I would NEVER recommend this as a place of business unless you hate yourself. I eould be embarresed to work in such a place. I almost got into a physical fight with one of the female employees because instead of being sympathetic and acknowledging the fact that this company as a whole totally missed the mark she thought it was a big running joke. I am poor but I am not ghetto and this company as a whole is ghetto and gets a minus F if I could give them a rating. They cost me time, emotional distress, and harrased me to the point of ridiculousness. I hope nobody foolishly goes here. Truthfully they are by far too expensive. I joined a subsiderary to Farmers and I only had to pay $100 to get it started & I pay less than I paued at Cost-u-less plus I do not get harrased for absolutely no reason. Go anywhere else other than Cost-u-less on Burney in Modesto CA. They suck to the max! Even after cancelling my policy with these jerks they are still calling me!<//Text>

I just called this guy for advise on my ebike, I could tell he was busy but he was polite and helpful. I told him what was going on with my bike and he knew exactly what was wrong and what I should do. I offered to pay him for his time but he said no. If he was in my town I'd take my bike to him every time!!</Text>

No nonsence small and friendly place. The prices are great and they do not push for you to buy things you don't need. They can fix just about anything that may be wrong with you bike. The offer new items as well as sone lightly used parts, when you are a bit short on cash to buy a new part. Since they are a small shop please call ahead to see if they have the parts you need</Text>

Fito doesn't know anything about bikes.do NOT ask him for anything you need he will say he doesn't have it. You will have to look 👀 for the items yourself in his small crowded store at an expensive price. The inner tube is cheap and is open when you need it<//Text>

I stopped by here because it's near the gym I go to. The menu selection is not the most extensive but I got what I wanted (#9 Bun thit nuong cha gio). I have been there twice already.  It's a mom and pop shop, sort of hidden. One of my favorite places to go to.< /Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Nice little spot kinda out of the way but really nice food from what I had anyways. Got the chicken curry with bread. The bread was clearly made at site today, it was really fluffy and warm. Curry was exactly what you would expect, big chunks of chicken and potatoes and a good yellow curry flavor. Also had the football game on so that was a plus as I was here on lunch break from work.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808e2e17a5e32e6f:0xa9b78cd6d495c4ed<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ask for no  pate if you expect the tofu sandwich to be vegetarian. One lady working; did not hear her wash her hands after she took our order. Said tofu sandwich was more onion that anything else and had no radishes; husband ordered chicken, got pork, and found a very thick hair in the middle of it.</review>

Been going here for 2 years. It's the place I frequent when I want Pho or summer rolls for my lunch. Food is consistently good here.</Review>

My husband & I stopped in here for a sandwich. They offer pork, beef, ham & chicken options for their vietnamese sandwich. While we waited we had the opportunity to review the menu board and pictures of plates on the walls. We quickly decided we'd be back to enjoy some of the offerings. A customer who was waiting for his order offered his opinion, "they have the best noodles in the area". As we also enjoy Pho...looking forward to future visits. We took our order to go along with our Boba...Thai tea milk & Green tea matcha milk....wonderful 😊 Very reasonably priced too...about $20 for 2 sandwiches & teas. We recommend you check it out when you have a chance 👍<//Text>

I eat in this spot a lot since I work nearby. I like how their service is always good and they keep the place neat constantly. Rates are affordable and they serve generous portions.</review>

<Review>BUCKLE UP! I ordered pad thai for delivery. Got it in a reasonable amount of time. Unpacked the food, ready to dive in, and...something doesn't look right. If you look at the pic, there in the middle of that potential goodness is a metal twist tie. Hiding among the noodles.

So, I called to let them know I need another one. And, I'll drive it back there. The gentleman on the phone said, "No problem, I'll give you another one and your money back." Exactly what they should do. And here's where things go bad really fast.

I'm getting ready to go back and I get a call. From that guy. He asks if I'm coming in. Yes, of course, but since I had it delivered, I have to get ready. OK.

Then, after about seven minutes, while I'm on the way, I get another call. He asks where I'm at. Not far, I say. Then he asks if I want my money back or  for them to replace the food. Hmmm, didn't you just tell me what you were going to do? By the time we get nowhere on the phone, I'm there and tell him we'll finish this discussion in person.

Bottom line: he insists he never said he'd take care of the bill and the food. He gets whipped up, which gets me whipped up. I walk out of there with no food and he offers me $10! Not even close to what I had spent. To top it off, while we're in the middle of a real, live pandemic, this guy has NO GLOVES on! And he's making and serving food! What the hell?

SKIP THIS PLACE! Stay away. Plenty of great Thai places in the area that don't have a rude, ignorant proprietor who doesn't understand how to take care of a customer when HE screws up; or even how to run a safe kitchen.

Note 1: It looks like this place is listed on other review sites under a different name.
Note 2: I don't think it's in him, but if I see a "Sorry we didn't live up to your expectations, what can we do" response, I'm going to lose it.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFH2B9zdF2yUESLG6d7khJkfKn8DDT-BtcZAvQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkDzlDBtbJS1Fb5kSLD97iTdKfT8P_fEyqIa-I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6XPks5yLv8aEZWA0-U0SUV3_Jy1RPtGYG0F-C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz9ntKwkeFG3IWPazg_4JWSivVJjtYMnDc_lNs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

<review>Real Thai flavors in a simple environment. Staff are Thai and treat you well 😊 Portion sizes are generous and prices are great (Brown rice, Basil Chicken, and bowl of Tom Yum for $14). Check it out if you want some authentic Thai food!</review>< Pics>

Satay - Small portion. Flavor was good. No char on the chicken like it was made in a pan. In comparison to other less expensive places it get 2 stars.

Order was short. I ordered 2, they sent 1, which they corrected imediately.  On response to their error, they get 5 stars.

Chow mein - very bad. Noodles were mushy over cooked and no flavor. The veggies were a mix of Broccoili carrots celery and bockchoy. Some were over cooked and some were raw. That was very strange. After a few bites I put it in the waste bin. This gets 1 star.

Thai tea - good. Decent size and flavor was good. It gets 3 stars. Good but not memorable.<//Text>

Pros: Delivery fee was only $1 and arrived exactly when estimated by email. Food was warm upon delivery. Vegetable Rolls were totally unique, deep fried but not greasy with excellent plum sauce. Peanut  sauce was great.
Cons: Pad Se Eew was totally sub-par, there was no sweet sauce at all, the noodles were too soggy, not nearly enough broccoli. Peanut salad was very disappointing, just an odd combination of vegetables, sliced too thick.
Bottom line: would not order from here again.</Text>

Went around 1 p.m. today for lunch. Ordered the red curry chicken lunch special, lady didn't look too happy about that. It came with a salad which was good with the peanut sauce. I heard a microwave go off twice and after the second time my food was brought out. Let's me know my food was not made fresh at all. Could definitely tell by the way the chicken tasted. There was only a couple dining there when I arrived so that should've been a sign for me. It's Friday, close to downtown, it's lunchtime, should be busy if the food and service is at least good here. But it wasn't.   All in all, I paid $10.97. Wouldn't recommend or be returning.</Text>

Always fresh ingredients. Made to perfection. I feel like they really care that my food is high quality. Visiting this restaurant is my little slice of Thai family cooking.< /text>< pictures>

I don't appreciate them upcharging. Adding to a sales tax and rounding is not how you charge people. Even though covid puts us at hard times it's unfair to charge others more.<//text>

<Text>I've been a couple of times, trying different things. What I've noticed about many of the dishes is that they put a lot of sugar in their food, even fried rice and tum yum soup (a spicy, sour soup) were sweet. I would not recommend the egg rolls either; they are mostly dough with a small amount of cabbage and carrot (see picture). The place and service are great with reasonable prices, just wish the food wasn't sweet.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd31af6a1f5efb:0x558a65ee835c4ea4< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>Well,  I used to go here because the food is delicious and they used to have good portions for a decent price.  Prices and quality are the same but when we ordered last our meals were miniscule. Not worth the price.  Even stranger,  we had to call the restaurant for our delivery order over an hour later, and when we went downstairs our delivery driver was standing in the middle of our courtyard watching something on his phone, and had apparently been there for a while.... get it together.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pics>

Tonight we ordered spicy fried rice which we always get and tonight it was almost like a mix between the fried rice and their basil rice and it was honestly just bad. We feel like we wasted our money. Not going to order from here anymore because it was too much money to justify an incorrect order.< /Review>< pics>

Now the food takes two hours to make, they keep you waiting for 90 mins+ telling you your food will be ready, when asked, they say "We are too busy" This is the fifth time this has happened in two weeks. Safe to say will not be going there ever again.

Prices and quality and lack of grease and diversity in flavor is best I can find in Long Beach, born and raised! Service was clear and concise, guy on the phone helped me order quick knowing what meats matched best with certain dishes.  It's rare for me to have a server on the phone assist me well with my indecisiveness . I can't believe how it beats my formerly first favorite thai restaurant! By far!<//review>

Had to wait for an hour and a half for bad food. Ate here about 4 years ago and thought I would give it another try. Huge mistake. Rude server and awful food. How I this place still in business? Thai Silk. Glad I bought extra toilet paper. This food is garbage.</Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>I ordered the combination plate, red curry tofu, garlic broccoli tofu and veggie soup. My partner ordered the Panang curry.  I asked for vegan, the waiter said okay.  I am giving this place 1 star because the vegetable soup had a piece of chicken in it and the broth was chicken stock. The menu is very misleading to the vegetarians/vegans. Also, the tofu was not cooked all the way, it was pretty raw. The red curry was bland and tasted exactly the same as the Panang. Will not be coming back to this restaurant.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Fast...faster than I expected ..friendly ..yummy ..everything pretty good...chicken larb salad yummm! Tom yum soup...sour and spicy ...I always order sticky rice and mango for dessert ...u won't go wrong here .
The larb salad is not ground chicken but rather pieces of chicken in a spicy lime dressing but still pretty good.  All in all I would order again. The fried won ton would be nicer if there were more shrimp or meat inside..but i can live with it. No utensils or napkins included FYI. Be warned ..if u ask for spicy tom yum soup...be prepared.. Its super spicy !!< /Text>

<username>Railroad fans of the Cajon Pass</username><Review>Today was not their best day. The two kids working together were struggling to keep it flowing. I finally got past gate after 3 vehicles who arrived after me. No vacums available as seen in picture. They sell you a wash and vacuum but often the vacuums are taken. Luckily one opened up as i was being directed to leave. Maybe better tomorrow. Normally a good place. I pay monthly. Maybe offer up express lane and guaranteed vacuum for people you have on monthly plans?</Review></record></dataset><record>

You're better off paying the $13 on product to wash your car yourself. The machine is always breaking down or not delivering the correct wash.
It kept spraying the soap but not washing it down with water.
We had to go through the machine three times before it thoroughly washed the car.
The only reason I will be going back is because I paid for the $20 deal, its the premium wash ($13) and you can come back within a month for another wash for $7<//Text>

Car came out hslf washed. Soap was still on it! Bad thing i bought 2 washes for 9 dls so hopefully next time it'll do it's job right. Not so happy about this experience.  I just moved here trying to have a good carwash place to go. Let's hope it's ok next time, or I'll find another place...< /Text>

I went to this carwash for over 2 years and now my paint clear coat is scratched off in several places. My bumper was torn off and the carwash refused to help. They just acted like they did not see anything happen. The whole thing was on camera and my car had no previous damage.</text>

Matt the manager is helpful, professional & kind. An employee was rude and caused my first time at the carwash unpleasant. Due to Matt's attention & professionalism in  customer service by apologizing and handling the situation right away, I recommend ProWash Xpress and will be returning.<//Text>

<Text>A little expensive, but a decent wash, they give you a brand new wipe down towel and you do your own vacuuming. I'd go again.</Text>< Pictures>

Don't get the machine tire shine gets all over the rim and does not cover all the tire. They wouldn't fix it the employee stated as long as it's on the tire that's all they can do.< /review>

Rude employee. Paid for the premium and tires didn't get the shine on. Ask to see if they could do it by hand and said no because I didn't get my receipt. Won't go back. 5/14/16<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) My first time I used this car wash and the front wheel hubcap was damaged as I entered, because the employee who was guiding me did it wrong and told me when it had been damaged I made the claim but the manager told me that they did not take responsibility ..... what to do in these cases?

(Translated by Google) Well for emergencies, I think they need to pay a little more attention when cars are a little dirtier because they leave the labate even with dirt spots, maybe it's time to change brushes.

Bueno para emergencias, creo que necesitan  poner un poco mas de atencion ciando los carros estan un poco mas sucios por que salen de el labado aun con dirt spots, talvez ya sea tiempo de cambiar brushes.< /Text>

Place is kept fairly clean. Security hasn't been a problem that I'm aware of.

However, this place has raised our rent 4 times in the last 2 years!!! And no visible improvements to explain why...<//text>

I have stored at locksley storage off and on now since 2018 and each time has been a terrific experience. The staff is excellent kind and experienced care takers of the property. My property was secured safely each time I stored here at locksley and I am a trusted customer of theirs that I keep returning when I need to store my property. It's easy access 7am to 7pm good hours and it's gated with your private code.</Review>

< review>
Booking online was very frustrating. Everything I entered just disappeared at one point and I had to start over. Whenever I tried to input a multi-numbered item such as birthday or credit card, it would auto-fill numbers I had already typed into the spaces where the next numbers were supposed to go, and then it would take 3 or 4 tries to delete them. However, when I finally went to the office to finalize everything, Dwayne was very friendly and helpful. He provided excellent customer service with a smile. I wish the unit had a light inside of it, and the hallway smelled like urine. It will work for now, but improvements could be made.</review>

<review>Spoke with agent before going in. Received clear pricing info. Was quick and easy when I went in and I got a very fair deal for a short term rental. The manager is friendly and helpful. The unit is exactly what I need and everything was very clean. 4 stars only due to high cost of their locks. Not surprising just a tad inconvenient...all storage places have expensive locks. I'll give them 5 stars</review><user>112727277859014886048</user><Pics>None</Pics><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Locksley Mini Storage, their customer service is wonderful and can't be beaten. My things we're in my storage room for 11 yeas. I would have let it go years ago but my daughter's things we're in there and she was killed by a drunk driver and her things we're all the physical things I had left of her. Times have been tough and at times I had a hard time with my bills, and Locksley always worked with me. I moved back to Rocklin when she died and eventually moved back home to Las Vegas a year later. When I came back in July 2020 to get my stuff I wanted to stay, it's so beautiful and green. After it has been 11 years I didn't have my key to my lock and the manager cut my lock off and did not charge me. That was amazing. I miss the kindness of Rocklin. Anyone will enjoy Locksley Storage.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Since the day I walked in there I felt comfortable Steven has been wonderful he he has always been there if I needed a lock cut or just information. It's always a pleasure to deal with him as he has a great sense of humor and knows how stressful it is moving stuff Soho so he is very understanding and patient</text>

<Text>I just rented a 5×5 and got a move in deal. Very pleased with the monthly price for the unit. Over all excellence in customer service a quick and easy application to lease the unit. The customer service representative was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions, courtesy and polite. Another C.S.R. showed me right where my unit was she escort me to the unit then asked me if I needed anything else and said have a wonderful afternoon. Very professional and has a great personality. I give a whole five star rating.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1566753312723, 'text': 'Hi Geoff , Thanks so much for your review!

Was real easy to get a storage unit, I was in and out within 10 minutes, the rep was nice and very helpful. They also gave a discount on the first months rent.

I was delighted to find Locksley Mini-Storage after looking at about a dozen other storage providers' websites, most of which would have required more time and energy than I had to invest. They were the first storage facility that I found that allowed me to make an online reservation (making the specified unit uavailable to anyone else) with no obligation, deposit, credit card or commitment to lease. The initiation of a lease was also fast, headache-free, and convenient. The level of convenience, low prices, ease of use, and the speedy lease app and proccessing times made Locksley Mini-Storage the best choice for my needs. (will update upon visiting the premises if necessary)</Text>

Rented a 5x5 and our things Were here less than one week and someone broke into my storage and stole my most Precious possessions. THEY ARE NOT SECURE There is definitely something fishy going on here. Be very careful. The price was great and we definitely paid for it we lost everything. There are no cameras no security nothing just anyone could come and take what they wish.  Management couldn’t care less. I am completely devastated At what happen and with  the response and actions from the management.<//Review>

WORST EVER!! I wish the rating system went into the negative numbers just for these guys! I have never dealt with more unprofessional people in all of my life! They harass you long before closing time, spy on you and steal your stuff! And the people who run it - The management - is a couple and the fights they have are insane! Insane and public! Whatever you do, spend your money elsewhere! The units are old, dirty and overpriced! Lost most of what I owned because of these people and their crazy imaginations. Could have, SHOULD have taken them to court because they acted COMPLETELY and ABSOLUTELY outside the law. BEWARE!!!!</Text>

Secondly, we don't hire couples to manage our storage facilities. Finally, we have gate hours outside of the office hours so there would be no reason for anyone to harass you before closing time.

This is the second time iv used this storage facility, and iv only had good experiences. I always get a bill way in advance of when its due, so I can make sure to get it paid on time. The place is always clean, and I don't see people hanging around like iv seen at other places.  The managers are always very helpful and easy to get in touch with. The new woman is super great, she's always very nice to my son.< /Text>

It never fails that I get a letter stating their raising the storage prices. I've been renting a unit here for several years so my fee is or should I say was somewhat less than what others are paying for the same size unit. Come to find out the reason the rates for me and some other long time customers is because the owners are raising our rates so that we'll will be paying the current going rate! That's "real concern for their customers" as they say in their advertisements wouldn't you think?! I've got to get my stuff out of this place as I can no longer afford their outrageous fees!< /review>

Had 2 very nice guitars, and a Scuba wet suit stolen out of my unit. They did nothing about it. If you have to store your stuff here just know that some of it will probably not be there when you go to move it out.< /Review>

This was the first storage place in Auburn we stopped at and the people that run the place are very friendly. We took a look around and it seemed fine... decent pricing and they are located very close to where we are currently living. We decided to go with Locksley. Big mistake! I wish we would have taken the time to look around at other storage facilities in the area a bit more. After moving in about half of our stuff we noticed large pools of water accumulating on a few of our items. When we grabbed a light and checked the ceiling there was water dripping along every inch of overlapping material (that's 5 joints x 25 feet long). We brought this to the attention of the people that run the place and they acted like it was a very unique situation. When we asked around a few of the other renters as well as people at other storage facilities in the area no one was surprised. These units are some of the oldest in the area and are not insulated (at all). They will accumulate condensation on the ceiling and drip onto your items. Do not waste your time here. Even if they ruin some of your stuff they will not even return your money for the time you rented. I attempted to get my money back from the people that run the place, then the owners, then my credit card company. No luck yet. BBB will be the next stop but in the meantime I would like to save anyone else from this waste of time and money.

The bottom line is prices around town are all very similar for storage units. For basically the same price you can get a much nicer unit, with a built in light and better insulation. The Locksley units have no lights and no insulation. We moved to another storage facility nearby and even during times of much worse weather there have been no water issues. Do yourself a favor and skip Locksley Mini-Storage, they are dishonest about the condition of the facility, the units will ruin your belongings and they will do nothing to fix the problem.<//Review>

I started using Locksley Mini Storage because I had a storage unit there in 1993 and didn't have any problems with them then so I got one there again. There was a fire in Auburn a couple years back it was all around Locksley Mini Storage. The managers were there with hoses making sure the property was safe. I was so scared but knowing they were there watching over the place made me feel better. I also had an inferior lock on my unit and they switched me for one that is more secure for no charge just so my stuff could be extra safe. The managers are so helpful and thoughtful. I really feel safe having my keepsakes stored there. I would and do recommend them to everyone. Robbin Stubbs</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Andy’s boarding grooming and daycare is top notch phenomenal! We are a small animal rescue and we make sure to have all of our dogs groomed here - before we send them off to their forever homes! We also board our dogs here by taking advantage of Simon’s packaged prices for training - grooming- boarding and doggy day care. We know our animals are safe, clean, loved and cared for!  Anna - Simon’s wife is a caring devoted animal lover who helps us pick out the best leashes, harnesses, collars, sweaters and or accessories we may need for each individual animal. I would not go anywhere for the care they take with our animals! I highly recommend the Sherman Oaks location!

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>4 stars for the healthy spot experience. I have never been to any of their locations but was referred to try. I made an appointment for my dogs Draper and Desmond to get groomed. The grooming area was super proficient and clean. The boutique at healthy spot had a fantastic selection of food and dog accessories. The price was consistent with other groomers in the area. The dogs seemingly had a great time and Draper's haircut looks great!  We will definitely be back!<//review>< pics>

Wow! I can not say enough good things about this place and the amazingly helpful staff! They genuinely care about selling you the right products and aren't trying to upsell you. They even gave my dog an incredibly generous sample to make sure she liked the food before we bought it! Definitely will be coming back!<//Text>

Our family loves this place! Elizabeth, the manager, helped transition our dog onto a raw diet, and he's never felt or looked better. We also go here for grooming and can't recommend David enough! If I could give Healthy Spot 10 stars I would.<//Text>

I take my dog there about 5 times a year.  I tell them to give "Skip" the Phoenix Buzz Cut.  Skip does better in the heat with the shorter hair and it is easier for me to clean house.  Call for an appointment.  They are following pandemic social distancing protocols.</text>

Andy’s Pet Grooming is the only place I’ve been taking my dog for the longest time. The staff is very friendly and very nice. I always call and make an appointment to be on the safe side cause they get really busy. My dog hates showering everywhere I would take him he would be afraid to get out of the car, but for some reason he doesn’t mind coming to grooming here because the staff is so nice and they take really good care of the dogs. Best part is they have a dog day care, which is really useful if I need to pick up my dog later, they take care of it. Make sure to check out this grooming place, prices are great as well.</review>

I don't like to be force to tip. I know things are different nowadays but I still feel that a tip is earned with good service and courtesy. Which in this case service was okay courtesy not so much.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I love Andy's. The owner cares about his business and does a pretty meticulous job with my baby girl. A little on the pricey side but you get what you pay for.  There's a special on doggie clothes, 5$ for some really cute things!  They also have a day care and all the dogs seem to get along well in there.<//Text>< UserId.>

The whole point of taking your dog to get groomed is to have their fur detangled and trimmed. I can easily give my dog a bath and brush her at home. When I picked her up they said it costs extra to detangle, I would’ve obviously paid extra to have it done if they just told me. She had tangles near her private areas and near her ears & face. They just left the tangles there without brushing them out, and neglected to tell me that they weren’t willing to do it? The guy told me that I need to brush her everyday to get them out, even though I specifically took her there to have them do it professionally. I pretty much paid $60 for an expensive bath that I could’ve done at home.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1566542848506, 'text': 'Hi Anonymous Anonymous we sorry to hear that you had bad experience at our store unfortunately the matts that your pet Bella has is not possible to dematt in one Grooming session and actually it’s a little stressful for your pet this why we suggest you to bring her back so we can dematt her  and we suggest you to brush out at least tow times a week however we are ready to dematt her and extra brush her anytime that you like to please feel free to contact us at anytime so we can take care of this situation sorry and thank you for your time .'}< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2963ca48c7823:0x864e0629fa0a3231</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They overcharge. Also, they have a great review because they ask their customers to give them 5 stars for a discount.</review>

<Review>Staff is friendly, but if you call about stock, make sure you ask them to physically find and lay their eyes on what you are after. On more than one occasion I was told they had what I was after, only to get there and their stock was off. Then have to drive to auburn.< /Review>< UserId.>

After having gone over the passes in the Sierras during the dead of winter and the worst conditions four times in one day. My battery decided Colfax was the place to die. The staff at Napa although having a ton of people in their store who were having car problems because of the weather as well. Were very friendly and courteous. They loaned me tools so I could check my charging system and battery. All in all great guys. They had the supplies to get me back on the road.< /review>

<text>The guys here are very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable and will answer questions and explain stuff to you even if you do not know much about cars.

That's Napa know how >.> Hahaha
This place seems strangely familiar. When you first walk in you get this waft of oily plastic smell filling every corner of your mouth. Quickly I become accustomed to it and ask for what I need. State your year, make, model, fule injected?  4door? Blue? 20 inch tires? Plastic engine cover? Once they narrow it down for you they ask what part you are looking for and then show you 4-8 different parts that widely range in price. Well we have a super performance or ultra mega super deluxe package with the difference being $30. I usually pick the one that breaks in a couple of months. Most of my stuff has a lifetime warranty that I don't ever plan on cashing in. I really don't feel like doing my struts again.. let em squeek..<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>This business is the EPITOME of why brick and mortar is going the way of the dinosaur...Rebies and Napa in general, charge 2,3 and 4 times as much as any online parts house...plus you get DELiVERY with an online order. .
Reibes has a narrow selection and i DARE you to call ahead for part availability, you will grow grey on hold waiting for a surly "parts man" to get it wrong. Im sorry, i like the people who staff it, but the powers that be at Napa are behind the times at best or GREEDY at worst. Im afraid they fall somewhere in between.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x809b0b0582694f03:0xadb30c6ac3bbac3d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Really like Dr Wendell very good storyteller. He is why I decided go to Bright Now. The staff is not as knowledgeable on how to guide the patient. The billing manager is most the knowledgeable. But X-Ray personnel was excellent and all dental care personnel is good. I was measured by the dental hygienist she was excellent. They have special for non-insurance $39 for exam and X-ray.</Review>

This dentist advised me I had periodontist and cavities. They Charged me several fees that I was un aware about and gave me a deep cleaning and a gum disease treatment. It totaled $1000. I was unable to pay it. They refused to see me again until I paid it. I made a payment agreement and they lowered the payment from 1000 to 700 just to be seen. If you make a payment agreement the dental office cannot see you anymore and you will need to find another dentist. I paid the 700 and went to another dentist.

I first went to get my wisdom teeth pulled and the I advised the dentist I a had that disease. He advised this is what dentists do to get more money. I then went to another dentist in another city because they had 5 stars and great reviews. I was then advised again that I did not have perio at all. He showed me the screen and showed me there is no bone loss as I was once advised nor cavities. Do not go here. Do not trust these people as they will not be honest.</Review>

So in the passed I've had Horrible experiences with the Dentist. It always felt luke they were trying to break records with complete disregard to there patients, needless to say lots of painful memories. It's always been hard for me to go to the Dentist, until I went to Bright Now! Dental on Fitzgerald. They are some of the best Professionals I've ever known, the Staff are friendly and understanding regardless of financial background, respectful and there attention to detail is excellent. I look forward to going to the Dentist Now and know that I'm in Good Hands. Thank you Bright Now! Dental</review>

<text>This place was just such a joy to just go in. Marcia was super welcoming helpful, patient and really took her time to explain me what my insurance would cover and what would be best for me. I was there for a good while having trouble with my insurance, and she always kept her friendliness. The dentist was also very helpful, kind and knowledge. I will definitely continue to be a bright now dental customer. They also keep the place very clean and follow prevention measures while maintaining friendliness. It’s so refreshing to be received with kindness nowadays as many businesses customer services are not the best, especially during Covid times. But bright now is definitely amazing and a joy to visit.</text>< pics>

<text>The worst dentists in the area I don't recommend going there.  Look for another place with better service. The prices are very expensive and the staff did not help you at all. In the last 6 months I went to El Cerrito and in Pinole very bad service.  and the prices are crazy and high.  They made me buy their insurance.  and then they digested me that it was not dental insurance which is something for the discount.  More than three times I was in the same situation that they sit you, they give you x-rays and then they send you a person before to collect the payment and then the doctor arrives to tell you what they intend to do to your teeth and then they tell you that you have to make another appointment  the process takes 2 hours and they don't do anything to you .. bad service.    😁This is the better place Pinole Family Dental. 😁 🦷🦷1310 Tara Hills Dr suite f, Pinole, CA 94564🦷🦷 no drama. the real dentist is there doctor mark.  👍🏻<//text><gmap_id>0x80857704456be61d:0x7d45025dda40d972</gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1603771814569, 'text': 'Hi Scat Pack, we always want our patients to have a positive experience and we’re truly sorry that you did not.

I had my first appointment in Rohnert Park a few weeks ago and I loved it! The staff was super friendly, and the light conversation made going to the dentist enjoyable. I went in to get some x-rays before scheduling my cleaning appointment, and was treated with respect and kindness by everyone. I was so lucky that Kim had availability to do my cleaning that same day! She did an amazing job, made sure I was comfortable, and dedicated a lot of time and effort to make sure I was happy. This office focuses on a positive attitude to bettering dental health, instead of shaming its patients for what they may be doing wrong.<//Review>

Always satisfied going in , organized, I see girls working real hard, now that they have new normal to keep everything at flow, Marsha always attentive to any question and doctor Ding always kind to answer questions. I don’t have Aetna anymore I hope my new insurance works with this place to continue my general teeth work.</Text>

<response>None</response><review>Bright Now Smile Dental, has one of the very out going Staffs. I have found then to be of great service in calling you almost nearly or if your early like I was yesterday I was called in early.  Plus, Doctor Forest Wendell, DDS IS VERY  kind and keep does not keep his patients just waiting in the waiting room. I believe they are a bit  on the high end of there pricing. Other hand they to great work. So I guess you get what you pay for most of the time.< /review><user_id>112934837967409422440< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80857704456be61d:0x7d45025dda40d972< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My first experience with bright now Dental has been a positive one. Bright Now Dental was very thorough and thoroughly explained everything as well. There are some things that were not covered At All by my insurance and that I will elect not to do but everything I can afford I will have done. They were friendly and thorough and my experience was good.<//Review>

I went to this clinic to get my normal 6 months cleaning. They told me I needed a deep cleaning and would not do my free 6 months cleaning I get from my insurance. I ended up paying for the deep cleaning and then they told me to come back in 3 months which I thought was just for my regular cleaning. When I got there they told me it was for another deep cleaning. I left and never returned. These people are all sales people all they want is your money.  Do not recommend them and will never return.< /Text>

The worst experience! They don’t do the work correctly I paid 3 thousand and I had to go to a new dentist to do it again most of their mistakes. The prices are so high even if you have insurance (i have 2 insurance and it didn’t help me a lot) they don’t have all the technology so they have to refer you to another dentist or specialist and obviously is more money.
Find another dentist, don’t go there.< /text>

<review>I have been going to Bright Now Dental for the last 5 years and my experience has always been stellar.  The staff is very friendly and they do go the extra mile for their patients. Yesterday, there was an issue with me changing insurance and they stayed on hold with my insurance trying to verify my coverage.  It took roughly an hour to get it all sorted and they still kept my appointment. Dr. Wendell is amazing because he always explains things to me in ways I understand and is never forceful about procedures. He gives me options and always leaves the final decision with me. I love coming to Bright Now Dental and will continue to do so for years to come :-)<//review>< resp>

< Review>
For my family's dental needs, Bright Now Dental is our first choice because of friendly staff and experienced dentist like Dr. Wendell. I would like to recommend this office to anyone who is interested in quality comprehensive care. Because this office has its own specialty doctors such as orthodontist and oral surgeon, so I do not have to juggle with different appointments at different offices. Financial assistance offered at the office helped us to complete the proposed treatment that was pending from years.Thank you Bright Now Dental staff for taking care of my family's smiles :)</Review>

This is a great Bright Now Dental office!! After being scammed out of $3000 by some 'specialist' Dr. Harandi in Walnut Creek, CA for the EXACT same surgery on the other side of my mouth, it was refreshing to find a real dentist! And this price was only $1400 for the SAME surgery scam dentist Dr. Harandi did! I will be making this Bright Now Dental practice my home office going forward. Thank you to all the wonderful staff here!< /text>

I had the worst experience here!! I came in to see the orthodontist for a consultation. He refused to give me the same treatment that a previous orthodontist at this same Bright Now Dental office had given me a few years ago. He lied and told me that it wasn’t possible. This office lacks professionalism and honesty. Do not waste your time and money coming here!</review>

The orthodontist are incompetent and rude. No ethics behavior towards “customers” meaning patients. No communication within their own business. I was sent by one of their offices for an operation/root canal and, this incompetent doctor tried to give me a lesson of how and why I supposedly went to have his opinion, again I was sent by one of their offices!
When I’m already driving home, with a great toothache, one of their losers ser alentadora called me and ask me if I was already gone, really? She informed the looser doctor realized that I didn’t go to get his opinion but to an actual operation-root canal.

I really hope they don’t charge me twice for being told the same (root canal needed ) by the same businesses or, otherwise I will be contacting first my insurance and second the BBB and informed about the incompetency of this business staff and a possible scam to get more money from my insurance.</Text>< pictures>

Be aware of terms like gingival irrigation and local antibiotics just a ripoff not covered by insurances. Also always check with your insurance for copays they are good inflating them.

My son scheduled for an appointment because of a cavity, the soonest available time was 2 months later.  Then before the appointment they called  to cancel because they had intake of a patient on emergency. They could only reschedule for a week later. They are not that good , best below average, and it does not worth for the long wait  particularly there is an existing issue.  My husband was told to go to their recommended  outside specialist dentist for  periodical deep tooth cleaning. It was ok the first time, but not necessary after that because the dentist did not really do anything. It was costly and a waste of time and money. It was a malpractice for giving such a wholesale recommendation not based on need. Time to find another dentist.
PS> Bright Now called to cancel the reschedule appoint saying that no doctors will be available and wanted us to reschedule again for a later date. Enough is enough, bye forever. After reading all the bad reviews on Yelp of malpractices and  money gouging, we don't want  any dental work from them. Fortunately, so far we have had only regular exams not any other things.<//text>

<Text>This is ultimately my favorite dental office I have ever been a patient in! Josabeth in the front is really informative about treatment, and the back office staff is incredible, making me feel comfortable despite my fear of the dentist. Dr. Wendell is great in explaining everything yet keeping it all so simple 😊<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

I came in for a simple cleaning for my wife and I. Mind you, I have full dental coverage for the both of us. They wanted to add some antibiotic for gum disease, they gave me an estimate of about 1000 dollars, which they stated was not covered by insurance. I paid it. Months later, I receive another bill for 25 dollars. I paid it. Recently received another bill "Forwarded balance" for nearly 500 dollars. This company is not upfront about the costs of the treatment or bills. I had already paid over 1000 dollars, and they continue to bill me regularly for one single visit. This is a horrible customer service and business model. I highly recommend you avoid this place at all costs if you want an honest deal for their services.<//text>

Love visiting Bright Now Dental in Pinole! They always deliver great customer service. The ladies in the front desk attend to every customer with care and are very efficient. Josebeth, Marsha and Yolanda are great at what they do they always ensure we are taken care of. The facility is clean and organized. I definitely recommend to pay a visit and see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!
P.S also help us out a lot with financing when we didn't have insurance.<//text>

I went to Bright Now in Pinole Ca. to get some big work done.
I had 2 teeth pulled, an infection cleaned out, 2 implants, a bone graft and 25 stiches.
I felt no pain at all.
Then about 3 hours later, the surgon called to see how I was doing.
It was an excellent experience.

I have been going to Bright Now for about 3 years and they always perform expert service.

The staff is friendly and helpful.< /Review>

< review>
Decided to give this practice a try since they are near my work and my old dentist is in Oakland (I work in Richmond, hassle to go there and back). Initially they seemed like a normal dental practice, the dentist performed an oral exam after X-rays, did a periodontal chart, asked if I have ever done a deep cleaning, said no, and he replied that I won't need one. Identified potential replacement of an older crown that wasn't done properly. Went back few weeks later to do routine teeth cleaning, and the nightmare started. She performed a wishy washy cleaning, said I had some gum cleaning, asked me to come back in 2 weeks to perform a new periodontal chart, so I did. She started to poke very hard into my gum pockets, and produced numbers almost double what their dentist identified couple months prior. She said I have to do a deep cleaning and apply antibiotics to 21 teeth! Cost is a whopping $3700. I laughed and said no way. Went back to my old dentist 3 weeks later for routine cleaning, they found hardly any bleeding and the periodontal chart depths were almost exactly as what the dentist produced at Bright Dental.  I knew the hygienist was a scam. Last month called them to do a routine teeth cleaning (been 6 months), and they replied that they will only do a deep cleaning. Told them I am not interested, and they insisted. SO I went back for another periodontal chart evaluation, and the same hygienist (Harpeet) , showed her numbers and the numbers from my other dentist office, she got defensive , told me if you don't trust us then why come here. Explained to her that I was giving this office a chance to earn my business and find out how could the periodontal chart numbers vary so drastically in less than 3 weeks. She proceeded to redo the chart and this time she was inserting the probe even harder (remember this is inserting a metal probe into gum tissue, insert until you feel resistance, not keep inserting into soft tissue to get extra depth readings). Anyway, she said the numbers are still too deep and she would only do deep cleaning. I requested the dentist, Dr. Wendell came and said ethically they cant perform regular cleaning, told him that I would sign him a waver, do a regular cleaning, he said he trusts the hygienist numbers, even though his own numbers were less by 2-3 mms per reading. He retorted that different operators can get different numbers by 2-3 mms, so essentially the margin of error is 3 mms, so told him if you subtract 3 mms from her readings, then my depths would all be 3 or less, and thus normal. He still claimed its unethical. I told him that you cant force a particular treatment on a patient , we are not in Cuba, and this is coming across as a scam, want to rip patients off. He gave me the spiel that this is not ethical, and he can only do deep cleaning or nothing. I told him I made a mistake coming to this office. I later called their corporate office and complained, they had the office manager call me, explained to her what happened, she insisted that they won't do regular cleaning, only deep cleaning. Cut a long story short, I switched to another dental office nearby, this practice is a rip off, stay away.</review>

They don't even deserve 1 star
WORST DENTIST EVER!!!!!!!

They try to bill you for services you did not need or request and then when you get contacted by billing, the put you on hold to speak with the office manager.

Of the 6 times I've been contacted and told to "Hold" the office manager is always at lunch not matter what time of day or night it is.

ODD or just fraud.  I'm contacting my insurance company to cease listing them as a network dentist.< /Review>

<Review>Always love goin to the games!

Sit with the 116 Crew!

Definitely a trip sitting in the stands with covid restrictions.

I hope that as the summer goes on we'll see more and more people at the games!

Go Storm!!!!!

And... I like the choice for IPA from Deschutes :)</Review>< GmapID>

Great family park, especially during baseball season. This weekend there was a home and backyard exhibits. There is also a nice fitness trail by the lake across from the stadium.< /text>

Will never come back. one of the workers was overly attentive to my younger brothers and when I confronted him he ran and tried to say I was threatening him. Something weird is going on there and I will not respect that. If you support inappropriate behavior with children, I can’t condone that.  Security refused to give their names and kicked us out when we tried to address it. Attorneys will be contacted and we will get to the bottom of this. The way security handled this situation was uncalled for. Children should be protected from inappropriate adults at all cost.</text>

The stadium is great, amenities clean and the field looks awesome. The only bad part was the LE Storm team lost 😢<//Text>

My family and i go to a few games each season and we always have a great time. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The mascot is hilarious. They really make you feel included in the game and the players ALWAYS take time to talk to the fans. We will continue to attend games here for as long as we can. Thanks Storm!< /Text>

8/20 - Came to see the Quakes play on a nice Fiesta Tuesday.  $3 beers and tacos!!  Had seats right behind the screen just to the right of the Storm dugout.  Very cool, and for only $16.  Not sure why, but there were only about 200 people there.  Seems like such a great, inexpensive attraction, that it would more full.  Neat little ballpark, and old-school outfield dimensions.  Another park off the list!!</Text>

Small ballpark so all the seats are good.  Food is good.  Togo sandwiches we're great.  Decent beer selection.  Storm are a fun team.  Farm team for the Padres.  Went there as a group with our Jeep club.  Good times.<//text>

Our experience was great except I am on a special diet and can't eat most "ball park food" and they wouldn't allow me to bring in protein bars. So it made for a long night. Just because we are on low to no fat, high protein and low carbs diet doesn't mean we don't like sports.</Review>

So the seats are spectacular. Cheap entrance. Eat first because the concessions are very pricey. Friday fireworks were very good</review>

Came for Little League night. Teams from the surrounding areas get to walk the field with their teams and banners. My grandsons like getting autographs from the players. They are very gracious to the fans and never refuse an autograph or picture. I always enjoy watching the game. There is a playground for the kids that you can purchase either tickets or an all day wristband. The food is pretty good but really pricey, that's why 4 stars. We have been coming to this event for several years and hope to come for many more.< /review>

<Text>Today was crazy, they were out of everything. No peanuts, popcorn, cotton candy. They only had a few beers. It was 61 degrees and dropping fast with wind. They had No hot drinks. Ran out of thier give aways,. Most of employees dressed in costume were not friendly. For a fathers day weekend it was scrappy.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvwaaRnTxKStCa-05miVKKkmkF4hEYXyfvk65r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMNdqd2p2LxvTvCdYm26S-K4ra2hInpI37NayI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9e7y7-FpiU6tes4OXPLJhX1tJxwz8bE8Z77aj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtUf9y5k6OdcaQIDB9aoKi_kpUxtc0Q5Z3llWo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsA60Fq9Et3X4HR14kL-wkAd7Xncr2cNDLOuGd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

<text>Our experience was great except I am on a special diet and can't eat most "ball park food" and they wouldn't allow me to bring in protein bars. So it made for a long night. Just because we are on low to no fat, high protein and low carbs diet doesn't mean we don't like sports.<//text>< pictures>

Attended a Halloween event. Pretty nice setup with three different scare events. Enjoyed it after a long day. The people who worked it were real interactive and all into there characters. I like how they made use of the building, innovative and creative.</Review>

Came for Little League night. Teams from the surrounding areas get to walk the field with their teams and banners. My grandsons like getting autographs from the players. They are very gracious to the fans and never refuse an autograph or picture. I always enjoy watching the game. There is a playground for the kids that you can purchase either tickets or an all day wristband. The food is pretty good but really pricey, that's why 4 stars. We have been coming to this event for several years and hope to come for many more.<//Review>

Opening day was packed.  The place was completely understand staffed.  Waited in line an hour just to get a beer.  As for the stadium it is nice.  Very clean.  A family of four can still go out and have a good time without taking out a second mortgage on their home.  Look forward to going again and hope the lines aren't as bad.<//Review>

< Review>
Went here on a Tuesday night when the tickets are BOGO free and also being advertised is a $3 tall can of beer and $3 tacos. 1st off the tall cans were not real tall cans, they are 16 oz. aluminum bottles. Tall cans to me are 24 oz. And all they had were coors light and miller lite for those prices. Even the free coozies the were giving away were for a 24 oz tall can. They ran out of the 3 dollar beers in like the 2nd inning. Then they ran out of tacos in like the 3rd inning. The real tall cans any flavor were available, but those were $10. Still a fun place to go with the kids.<//Review>

We don't get out here enough, and it's a shame.  The Storm stadium is always a great time.  The cost of the seats is very reasonable.  The concessions have plenty of options.  And they have great daily specials.  Not to mention we have an awesome team, who are very entertaining to watch.  I wish we could make it more often, and it is a goal we have for this season and future ones.< /text>

Love this place. There are many give aways and activites to keep the kids busy. And who doesn't love a clean stadium during a ballgame.  Thunder and Mini Thunder are a hoot and they entertain the fans. Food is reasonably priced. Wish they had Coke or Pepsi products but other than that I'm always happy to go.</text>

We don't get out here enough, and it's a shame.  The Storm stadium is always a great time.  The cost of the seats is very reasonable.  The concessions have plenty of options.  And they have great daily specials.  Not to mention we have an awesome team, who are very entertaining to watch.  I wish we could make it more often, and it is a goal we have for this season and future ones.< /Text>

I love this stadium. It's close to freeway access and there's plenty of parking. Hang out at the Hanger 24 landing strip, watch the game and enjoy a cold beer. The stadium food is great, also!<//Review>

Went to the stadium to see Robby Gordon's Stadium Super Trucks, was a lot of fun and a great event. The Lake Elsinore Storm stadium is very well organized and the extra pay seating was great and an awesome way to watch the event.</review>

We love Lake Elsinore Storm. Take the whole family not a bad seat in the house. All the work they are putting into the stadium is fantastic! Off season events are helping this event center to be a year around attraction. Can't wait for the new season to start, Go Storm! Wish you were still minors to the Angel's, love you any!</Text>

We came here for the Twenty19 Pet Walk. One and a half mile dog walking. Around 500 people and their dogs walking. Awesome. You get to walk on the tail of the lake. Great landscape and friendly neighborhood.< /Text>

A Good time was had by all.  Great stadium design, so all seats are good seats.  You feel at ease and entertained.  Seniors to adults are enjoying the experience.  And, prices are relatively inexpensive.</Text>

<text>Renovated during off season
Good variety at concession stands.  Added some new choices from last year, including two-piece fried chicken plate.  Lots of parking available.  In-game activities were fun.  Mascot "Tunder" very good, and could compete well with the Philly Phanatic or the Singing Friar< /text>< Pics>

First off I did not go see the Lake Elsinore Storm. I went to Field of Screams their Halloween production. It could have been a lot better. The Mazes were adequate but lacked enough jump-scares. The real problem was the number of people they allowed into the park. The wait lines were insane. Upwards of 1 hour. They really need to cut that down a bit. All in all it was good but not worth the $20 a person.</Text>

<text>The staff here was amazing, very fun happy people there. The staff helped make the event enjoyable and also helped to provide a good atmosphere for the game. The food is very reasonably priced especially for a baseball game or event in general. The parking is also cheap and there is a lot of parking too. They have free parking for veterans and handicapped people and allow you to park closer if needed. Overall I would say I had a great time here and had lots of fun.</text>< user>

It’s a fun family place. Thunder and little Thunder (mascots) are fantastic. The kids are amused adults can watch a game. The race against the squirrel is fun to watch. Give it a try.< /review>

Much bigger stadium than I expected and it was all well kept and clean. The food was pretty basic ballpark food and overpriced as you’d expect at a ballpark. The lines to get food or a beer we’re CRAZY LONG though... took like 45 min just to get a hot dog and a beer then you end up missing the game. You could easily spend your whole time just in line to get a beer and start at the back again to get the next round.</Text>

<Review>Really fun place for everyone. They do something a little different each night the Storm plays like: Monday is dog night, taco Tuesdays etc.. I would definitely recommend this place to my family and friends as well as anyone who enjoys good, community oriented baseball.<//Review>< UserId.>

Great experience, minor league baseball is so much fun, the kids were certainly kept busy throughout the game with various promotions, activities, mascots, games, balls etc.  Me as a baseball guy loved watching the talent with lots of seat room and great hosts from the ticket takers to the parking lot attendants.  Too bad I live in AZ cause next time I am in California, I'm going to try to get to another game.</Text>

Went to the stadium to see Robby Gordon's Stadium Super Trucks, was a lot of fun and a great event. The Lake Elsinore Storm stadium is very well organized and the extra pay seating was great and an awesome way to watch the event.<//text>

Love it here! Great entertainment for the family. But eat before you go. Prices are high and you can wait an inning or two to order tgen wait for your food. So eat before you go and buy drinks and prepackaged snacks like popcorn and peanuts so you don't have to wait in line so long.</Text>

I just went to the game today and they have an excellent organization and an excellent roster. They won and I caught a foul ball! If you go to one of their games you can get a nice view from pretty much from every seat. They have an excellent stadium!
Go Storm!!!</review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><text>Great and only place to catch a local minor league baseball game. The seating is great no matter where your tickets are. The food is overpriced for the quality but not as bad as similar locations. Lots of fun activities to keep the kids entertained while watching the game. Aggressive sales or marketing members just inside the gate can be rude when told "not interested".< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Old ball park. Only advantage is it is big enough for graduation ceremonies. Sound system not very good.< /Review>

This is where I ran my first Spartan OCR. The Super on Saturday. The town is nice and accommodating. Plenty of places to eat and get last minute race prep items. I did a tenant improvement project for work on Mission Trail back in 2005. I drove up there at least 1x a week for Construction Adminstration. It's a nice place overall.</review>

<review>A great place to take in a ballgame.  They put on fun activities between every half inning.  An inexpensive family venue.  Mascot Thunder is terrific and better than many MLB team's mascots.  Great "premium seating"  that doesn't  come at a "premium" price.  Seats behind Home Plate only $13!! Each.  Only 70 miles from San Diego.  Hot dogs, pizza,Baskin Robbins ice cream, all top notch.  A new lounge area down third baseline and a sit-down restaurant add class and ambiance.  Plenty of parking including ADA available only 5 bucks.  Plenty of accessible seating in varying price ranges available</review>< Pics>

<Review>The Storm stadium is the best place to watch a baseball game. This is where America's past time still comes to life,  where dreams of young men hoping to make it in the big leagues comes true, and where the big eyes of little boys and girls get to see up close the heroes that play on the field of dreams. And sometimes, they even get to run the bases too.</Review><time>1503461698897<//time>< user_name>

This is a great venue that is easy to access and is close to a major highway and eating establishments. The management always has an exciting array at events planned from baseball to mud runs! All events are handled wonderfully with adequate security and we'll stocked outhouses, restrooms and clean seating. I have not gotten my shoes stuck to the concrete under my seat even once!<//text>

Went on a Sunday and got free tickets because I am military. We got to pick our seats and sat right behind home plate! It was an awesome experience. They chose my son to throw the first pitch and that is something neither of us will forget. He got to get a lot of autographs and balls. My dad, son, and I had an amazing experience! We will definitely be going back again. I've always been a die hard padres fan but am also now a Storm fan!</Text>

Seeing a Storm game is always a good time. From Thunder (the mascot) to cheap concessions, this is a great place to catch a minor league ball game. Tickets are super cheap too. A good time for the whole family!<//review>

Got to the gate.. was told I had to throw away my sunflower seeds. Git to the snack bar was told a 16 oz Coke is $4.75. this is after paying $16 for a ticket. This post lace has changed from last year and no longer has the fun inexpensive atmosphere it once had. NO SEEDS, HORRIBLE.<//text>

Terrible vehicle traffic pattern in and out of stadium.  Seating would have been good had "deck" seats been explained at all on the website.  The "grass" out along the right field foul line is basically a dirt berm.  Not much positive about that area.  When there are a lot of people like the 4th of July all inconvienves are amplified.  Advice for a better experience...go early, buy a regular seat at least a week prior, (do not expect to be comfortable in the grass), expect to pay $5 for parking, $7 for the kid zone experience and expect to spend a lot on concessions, you'll have a much better time knowing these things.</text>

From San Diego, have always wanted to make it up for a game - finally got to in August 2014.  Absolutely great experience from the intimate ballpark to the friendly staff and fans.  We had some food and beers at the left field restaurant/bar, and were fortunate enough to meet some of the scoreboard operators, PA, music, and radio guys.  Such a fun experience - we'll be back in 2015!< /review>

Nice local minor league baseball stadium, (The Storm ) good ole fashion American past time for the whole family...
good parking, but to few entry's and exits, go early ! and allow plenty of time to navigate your way out afterwards.
Aside from the baseball, its also a nice venue for entertainment like concerts, or social events like graduations.
and who can forget the Concessions, Hot Dogs, Beer, and my personal favorite garlic Fry's, just to mention a few of the classic YUMMIES that can be enjoyed here...
and last but not least.. FIREWORKS !!! come and enjoy the fun.</Text>

Went to Lake Elsinore diamond for a minor league baseball game, home of the Lake Elsinore Storm. The stadium has $5 parking across the street. Inside there are three major food stalls and multiple small vendors. The seats were alright and pretty clean. Restrooms were decently clean for a sports venue. They have specials throughout the week including taco tuesday, free hot dog mondays, and $2 beer Thursdays. You get to sit pretty close to the dugout and home plate for a decent price.<//review>

Wow. Well i won't be ordering nachos again. The parking has huge cracks in it. We actually saw a woman fall and have to be taken to the emergency room by the paramedics just walking to the gate through the parking lot. Usually I would have more positive remarks, but i was disappointed in last nights experience. The food made me feel not well today. And i really hope that woman didn't break any bones. How ever, The lemonade was good. Next time I will eat before i go and smuggle in some sunflower seeds.< /Text>

This is a minor league baseball park, home to Lake Elsinore Storm, affiliate of the San Diego Padres. Besides the game itself, entertainment always includes enjoyable skits mostly focusing on kids' participation. Venu is laid out well, partially because attendance is fairly sparse, depending on draw of team's opponents. Parking fee is pretty low and located close to the entrance of the park. And, there are special attractions almost every game like fireworks on many Fridays and flat-out free hot dogs on other days. As a senior riding a motorcycle to the games, there are double savings. Tickets for seats just feet away from home plate are an unbelievable$10. Once inside, PA system announces players' names and other information that doesn't interfere with actual play on the field. Personally, I plan to attend as many games as my schedule allows.< /text>

It's a really nice facility but the security are jerks. Well at least one of them is.. I went there for my graduation rehearsal and simply wanted to ask the security a question on fortunately I stutter so it took me a minute to get it out but he was very rude and acted like I was an idiot but for not being able to speak as quickly as he would like.

He needs to learn about all people are different and to be patient kind and respectful.. Because honestly if that was my first M pression of the staff there I wouldn't go there again</text>

If I was a less scrupulous person I could have printed 100s of fake tickets.

My friend won 4 tickets at work and couldn't attend. She offered me the tickets and I took 3 kids and their Mom and Grandmother. We had a ball. Jaden who is 7, also won the free ice cream with gummy bears and took pics on the motorcycle at thepolice booth. Jaden was so overwhelmed and happy......Thanks for a fun filled evening.<//Review>

Been going here for graduations and storm baseball games since I was a kid. Plenty of food vendors choices around the stadium and a bar on the northern side of the baseball diamond. The only negative thing I have to say is the security here believes that they are actual law enforcement officers to the point where they confront off-duty officers who have shown their creds about carrying their service weapons. Pretty disappointing because they have RCSD there anyways and the off duty officers have their creds.< /Text>

Ive been to the Storm games many times over the years but 4th of July 2018 is the worst ever. Never have I seen such a mess at the food stands. Waited 25 minutes for nachos. Bad service period! Missed half the game waiting in line after line after line. Shame on you Storm management!< /Text>

Part of San Diego Padres. Badass. I had been going to this stadium since '95 and hasn't change yet but to be honest it does need a Mini replica size of the Petco Park park change. But either way its a great Minor League ball park. Go Storms. Go Padres.</text>
