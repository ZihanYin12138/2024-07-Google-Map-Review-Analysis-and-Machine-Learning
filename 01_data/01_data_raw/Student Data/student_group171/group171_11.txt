< Review>
I love being a cosmetology student at this campus because of the amount of support and help that I receive with my clients from my instructors and the staff here. I am extremely thankful for Victoria, Gary, Betsy and Ashlee for the tremendous amount of support they give me  to complete my program. I’m very appreciative of how I can go to any of them for anything. Their doors are always open to help me and discuss any issues.</Review>

i enrolled in the medical assistant program the experience i had here was very displeasing and disturbing to say the least the level of "education" i received here was substandard and certainly not worth $14,000 when the class room and the material/equipment was outdated in short supply and did not even work most of the time the lab work we did was a joke we only had an hour each day of hands on training in a five hour day and the rest was book work to which we did not even go over as a class we had to do most of it on our own when ever we needed books to borrow for our work both the instructor and the director told us we had to stay after class to use it because they did not lend out the books it took them months to disburse my student loan and only received the final amount after i graduated which i did not sign up for nor dose my paperwork reflect that the financial aid officer by the name of Amy was very rude and disrespectful to me and is to other students and they cant even get my RMA exam set because they cant get finances straight but yet my paperwork states that my tuition and loans already paid for it i brought several issues and complaints to the director and to corporate only to be given one excuse and lie after another and then flat out be ignored i have pictures of holes in the ceiling and notes of where electrical outlets do not work and yet the director has yet to fix any of it they offer little to no assistance in job placement at all, all of the "help" i have received is nothing less of what i have been doing on my own merit and it has been over a month since i graduated and still no job i am now forced to look for work outside my new profession because of this i did not go to school to end up back in the oil fields at a temp agency or fast food restaurant i went to school for a carrier not excuses i do not recommend these facility's what so ever and seriously hope that this review will serve to enlighten potential students of the issues of this school staff and overall quality of the education they provide before they sign up because i do believe the students currently attending deserve better they what are paying for and for the students who graduated i believe we are owed more than what we got form them<//text>

It’s an amazing school and they have good communication. I was really iffy but all in all I am really glad I ended up going to this school. Melissa Martinez had helped me sign up in the beginning and then got promoted and was and I good at her job. Melissa loves to make sure everything runs smoothly and so does the instructor Melinda. I decided on the massage program.<//Review>

<review>Hello I am a barista at Starbucks today one of your career coordinators I believe her name was Desyray she was a nice woman shared some interesting and inspirational information about the school and courses. She was enthusiastic and encouraging me to possibly going into a career other than just working for Starbucks. I have to say she really made me realize I need to think about my future. If I do decide to give the school a try I really hope she is there to guide me she is an isnspiration and an asset to your school.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I was a student for the esthetician program 2 YEARS AGO! and they ALWAYS try to find new things to charge you for! When I pay them they tell me I no longer owe them but a month later I owe them a similar amount. That place is just a JOKE! I regret going to Milan. The financial aid is also a joke. I been trying to talk with them and they always say "they will call me back"....2 years STILL NOTHING. They are all messed up. I learned almost nothing from here. Please save $12,000 and find somewhere else cause you are going to owe them forever!<//Review>

I started going to Milan to get my hair done last year. I have had a lot of compliments , I have loved my hair every time! The  only thing I do not recommend  is getting nails done. I have on 2 occasions had my nails done. The  1st time the girl said that nails was not her thing and I believed her when she finished my nails. The 2nd time I decided to get acrylic nails, it looked ok, but one of the nails came off on day 3 and the others were lifting . I had to go to another salon and have then fix all tree he nails.</Review>

ATTENTION PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS their financial aid department is their just to make the sale like any other business. They will trick you into opening multiple loans but they wont call them loans they will name them financial aid grants 😂 that you pay back 6 months after you graduate

I give it one star because this school is a business to help themselves but not the students.
They cherry pick what they want to charge you based on how bad you want to attend and then you have to commit to go work for free in their salon if you want it to count.
You'll have to pay out of pocket because financial aid won't pay for the whole thing so practically you're paying to use their salon.
Feels like a double charge to me.
I'm choosing another career</Text>

Horrible company I guess they removed my other review I made when this happened...they couldn't give me an exact price at all ...they left me in the dark when it came to not being given any fasfa money until 4 months into the program... That money was for housing food & other stuff... I got nothing out of this school so I left ...now after they are going bankrupt a year later they try to charge me 1,800 dollars on my credit ...i don't owe them anything if anything they owe me money how about the 5,000 in grants they refused to give me when they got my fasfa< /review>

"It doesnt look bad" - the floor manager, Laura. Her response to the disaster I endured under the clippers of a student and instructor who could not follow instructions. I went from long hair that i had been growing for a long time to a short haircut that was forced on me after the instructor took it upon himself to take too much length off the sides. I was wary of the student's ability after the first time he called the instructor over. I was put on full tilt when the instructor decided to give me what seems to me the only haircut he knows how to give. I was sure i would never return to Milan Institute for even a free haircut after the floor manager said that i signed a waiver and therefore nothing can be done to remedy the failure of two of their staff members. She did give me a 50% discount. Worst mistake i made was going to Milan. No doubt that most people will say you get what youre paying for. I wonder if the students there also pay next to nothing for their training. BEWARE: spend the extra bucks for a real haircut. If i could give zero stars, i would.</review>

Graduated student from Milan. This school was amazing. The instructors are very helpful, the curriculum was on point. Almost everyone who graduates from here has passed their state board. I would say 80-90% of graduating students. This school also pays for your state board kit, which is not included at other schools.
As for the salon floor. There is very limited teaching staff. 3 teachers to 100 students. They do what they can. The wait and work is a little longer, but hey they are students. All of my clients had loved their experience and have returned my whole time while on the salon floor.  Please people. Let the students do their work. I have nothing bad to say about this school. I have spent 10 hrs a day here for 13 months and have enjoyed my entire experience. I would recommend this school to anyone. And as for the salon i would say, just be patient with the students.< /review>

The teaching is below zero the product is very bad you will come out knowing so little and the cost is extremely high compared to what you will learn and have knowledge in when you leave!!  You can go to a Paul Mitchell school for almost the same price!!   Beware Before you sign up !! Really look into the school, Success rate, What you will owe in total after you are done!!< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Very rude staff. They treat students like they are children or inhuman. Unprofessional and rude. The financial aid department has it's head up it's butt. They don't apply the Board of Governors fee waiver (BOG) and will try to confuse you on the actual amount owed/federal aid entitlements. They state that students must complete 300 hours to be allotted FAFSA yet when asked for documentation on those regulations they will not provide them or give any reference. So that means they are making up regulations because otherwise they would have copied or printed those documents off for our reference.

My girlfriend and I now have to go to our State Representative, the police, and City Hall to get to the bottom of this mess. Save yourself the hassle and just go to a regular college! 0 stars!<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>Horrible experience. The student was great and nice. The teacher needs to be better at her job of instructing the students. Did not get what I asked for. I came in asking for carmel highlights and got nothing close to that.<//review>< Pictures>

Honestly I love this school i wouldnt have chosen another school. people dont understand that this school isnt a school of professionals this is a school full of students who are trying to learn, I dont regreat going here for a sec I love the staff and they just want to make sure we learn as much as possible before we go out in the real world. Short story they are great people students and staff and the suport from the public is what they need, they cant learn on nothing..<//review>

< Review>
The video can be found in the photos. The altercation took place yesterday  at 6:00pm. The receptionist was being extremely caddy with another student. I asked politely for her to stop, that It was unprofessional, and the stylist was my sister. The student then decided to approach me with a condescending tone and say, "Are you talking to me? Because if you are, we are gonna have a problem." I had to stifle a laugh, does Milan have a secret door to high school? Wait, It gets better.

The husband of the student was also there. He too is a student. He then proceeds to start yelling laughable nonsense. I caught "I don't care if your Jesus Christ himself" and "that's what you get." I truly think he thought he was scaring someone. I don't know who though, but I digress...

This is the end of the incident, when his voice started to reach a sound only dogs could hear, and where I loose my patience. I simply got tired of being screamed at by a person with a low IQ and even lower morals. Apparently, to him (a paying customer who was simply trying to ask the low class receptionist to stop being caddy) I deserved it because I was "yelling" at his wife which was a bold faced lie. His wife is the one who approached me in a violent nature. Yes, a student smocked up and all wanted to get physical lol. Now you may be wondering "what did the instructors do? They did nothing. You see in the video them standing about, thumbs hard up their backsides, allowing a student talk to a customer in this fashion.

The female student (aka the wife) upon seeing a video of their brain dead behavior being made, stops, but her husband keeps going. All the students there were horrified but not surprised because this type of behavior is regular and allowed.

The receptionist, a surly, crunchy-haired, blonde, needs to be fired. We asked other students if she was perpetually ill-mannered, and they all said she was. As for the two eavesdropping students, Erin and Amy, they need to be kicked out.

However, seeing how this school is run I doubt it will happen. This type of behavior will continue. I think it is important that students know what kind of "institute" they are giving their money too. Save your money go somewhere else. I'm currently trying to spread the video and my experience like wild fire. I hope to get ahold of someone hire up that will give me my money back, yes I still acted as a good customer and paid! Lol, and make it right for the other students. That is, remove the unecessary evil that is in that school.<//Review>

<Name>brandi de la garza<//Name>< Review>
After calling first I took my mother in for senior citizen manicure/pedicure special. Reception was a bit cold, no eye contact and not very friendly. The wait was 30 minutes although no other customers were waiting. There were several staff/students hanging out (around front desk and a few more sitting in the manicure area), not looking busy at all other than chit chatting. There was a blonde haired woman that seemed to be in charge - maybe a teacher? - casually waltzing around here and there. The student that talked to us was pleasant and let us know she was preparing the station first and would come get us soon. I few minutes later she came back and led us to a manicure/pedicure workstation.
(I helped my mother sit in the chair. She can walk short distances with a walker and supervision; she speaks some English but prefers Spanish; she has Alzheimer's/dementia and is 93 yrs old. I am with her at all times as she also is very hard of hearing and gets confused when people don't know how to communicate with her.)
While the student was gone, the short, wavy, blonde haired woman came up to me and asked if I was also getting a service, and if not I was to go sit at the front where we were waiting before - a good distance from where my mother was now seated with her back toward the entrance. I said that my mother needed me to stay with her as I was her caregiver and she needed me to help her communicate, etc.
This woman's demeanor was callously rude and she was not budging about me not being allowed to stay next to my mother. She offered no reason at all for why I couldn't stay with her, just that she wasn't having it and she walked off before I could ask what the reason was and what harm it would do as no other customers were in the area, so it wasn't crowded or anything. A few stations away, there were a few other students lounging.
My mother felt the tension although she didn't understand the details, she is capable of recognizing when someone is being unkind toward her/us so she wanted to leave. She asked what was wrong and I just told her the lady said I could not sit with her while she got her nails done. My mother wanted to leave then, so we started toward the front door. She felt horrible and I especially felt it when she was trying to get her walker unstuck from the carpet at the front door as we made our way to the car. As we were backing out, another of the student/staff women came running toward our car waving and saying I was needed at the front desk. I asked for what; she said she didn't know. I just told her I was incredibly pissed at how rude everyone was and the way we were treated and I have no reason to go back in there after all that, no way, absolutely not.
The one star is only for the interior of the building itself. Looks professional. But these people are not interested in being professional or customer oriented at all. What these students are learning here is how to be snobby, callous and completely anti-customer service. This is a horrible place to take a senior citizen.<//Review>

<Text>Spent 5 hours here for a cut and color. Left with severe chemicals burns from the dye because they did a double dye after I specifically said it was burning. And the second dye was done by the instructor. I had expressed how much pain i was in but he never said we could take it out. Won't be going back.<//Text><UserId.>111866962295131560896< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

the absolute WORST experience I've ever had was enrolling and attending "class" at the Bakersfield West "campus"... corrupt from top to bottom... tests are open book open discussion... they'll mark you present when you are not there....  The significance is that if you dont get your 17,750 in loans, you have to pay per day... Wish I could do more damage to them than this little review... I would never ever recommend this "school" to anyone...  they don't even merit one star but had to hit a star to post this.

When you go to do your hair they take 3 hours for a one color hair style why waste your time there plus all you hear is the students having conversations about how other people’s hair look yellow like if there all professionals when they are just students plus they criticize people. Pay a little more somewhere else but don’t waist your time here!< /text>

I received a call from a telemarketer saying you can register now and create a career opportunity for yourself
Later on after I came the teachers who have little experience or education or simply hired because of their ethnicity were rude disrespectful and very stupid if I asked a question their response would be look in the book<//text>< Pics>

Just graduated from Milan, I have to say that just meeting students and making amazing friendships has been such an amazing experience due to Covid it did set us back a little but overall I don't regret anything  I've also creating amazing bonds with instructors... I had the most help from Gary, Ashlee and Betsy and Joey for a smooth transition. Thank you<//text>

Today 6/24/2021. We me and my father in law traveled from Arizona by vehicle, which is an 11 hr drive one way! Arrived @ the San Francisco Honduran Consulate @ 4:45pm. We asked for some service and almost got rejected. But the woman said we had to come back on the 3rd of July, 2021 to make an appointment. This experience has been very unprofessional. This woman was rude and said without looking at my fathers paperwork that she cannot help him get his ID or passport. And this woman had the audacity to say when I asked for her supervisor or someone above her position, that their WAS NO ONE ELSE ABOVE HER!! My question to anyone out there please help me find out who her boss is or can I contact of Vice President of the United States of America. Kamala Harris. This woman who runs the Honduran Consulate is very much out of Control.. Something needs to be addressed to the correct Authorities.. please help me with a phone number or email address of this Consulate of Honduras Higher up Management or Supervisor or California State interiors office phone number.. I want answers before I leave with my tail between my legs. Thank you some much<//text>

Did anyone ever get the contact information for the supervising officials of this SF Honduras Consulate Office?  Yesterday we were advised that in order to renew an expired Honduran Passport (expired March 2021) you must present a valid Honduras Identification in addition to a birth certificate and the expired passport.  We had the expired passport and the valid birth certificate, a current green card and valid CA drivers license.  The clerk insisted that a valid Honduras ID card is mandatory to recieve a salvo-condutos to complete my travel to Honduras and renew the passport while there.  I explained my flight was scheduled to depart last night.  That did not matter.  Admittedly I inadvertantly allowed my passport to expire.  I maintain weekly contact with all my family in Honduras.  However, I am only able to travel home 1- 2 times every 5 - 7 years for 2 - 3 weeks.  I have resided in the US since 1987.  Why or how would I have a identification issued in Honduras.  Has anyone heard of this?  The other option was to bring a 3rd party into the SF consulate that had a current Honduran ID and passport that will swear under oath to my identity as a Citizen of Honduras and to my actual person.   It will be practically impossible to renew my passport under these restrictions.  Any help or suggestions greatly appreciated.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>(Translated by Google) June 23,2021. I went to the Consulate of Honduras in San Francisco CA, for the second time, I did a consular procedure (AUTHORIZATION), with a PREVIOUS APPOINTMENT as REQUIRED, take all the documents that the system gives when you finish filling out the form with the data they ask for. I arrived at the Consulate at the peak time of the Appointment, they treated me very WELL, the Consulate staff were very polite, very professional and very quick to do the procedure, the system they have with social distancing was very orderly; I am very happy because this is the second time that I have had to go to the Consulate of San Francisco and they treated me the same !! I am sure that if we all comply with the steps required by the Consulate, our procedure in place will be pleasant! Thanks.

(Translated by Google) The people who worked there believe the CONSUL and they are simple boot licks, it is identical to being there .. they have the same service .. It seems that one reaches them to ASK and they are not because because that is their DUTY to attend .. for that They pay them. They cater to those they want, to whom they do not put a thousand obstacles ... and badly educated the sour!

<Review>(Translated by Google) THE TRUTH THAT THEY DO NOT ATTEND WELL TO PEOPLE WHO NEED CONSULAR SERVICES, WHEN YOU SPEAK, THEY GIVE YOU AN INFORMATION AND WHEN YEGAS IS ANOTHER, THEY ARE VERY ANGRY TO ATTEND, THE PREVIOUS CONSULATE WERE THE SAME, THEY DID NOT HAVE CHARISM, and the only thing that changed was the place Where did they move but they always give the same treatment, I don't know why the consulates treat people so badly

(Original)
LA VERDA QUE NO ATIENDEN BIEN ALAS PERSONAS QUE NECESITAMOS DE LOS SERVICIOS CONSULARES, CUANDO HABLAS  TE DAN UNA INFORMACION Y CUANDO YEGAS ES OTRA ,SON MUY ENOJADAS AL ATENDER ,EL CONSULADO ANTERIOR ERAN IGUAL NO TENIAN CARISMA ,y lo unico que cambio fue el lugar a donde se movieron pero siempre dan el mismo trato nose porque los consulados tratan tan mal alas personas</Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I am trying to make appointments online and they do not send me the confirmation to my email, how can I make sure the appointment is made? (At the end of making my appointment it says "Your appointment has been created successfully") but they do not send confirmation to my email that says it has to be and print. I would not like to go for pleasure, make my daughter miss classes and miss a full day of work. Please any answer? I will introduce myself soon, but I'm going to bother if I'm going to taste like losing work at all. I am nervous!

(Al finalizar de hacer mi cita dice "Tu cita ah sido creada con éxito" ) pero no me mandan confirmacion a mi correo que dice que tiene que ser e imprimir. No me gustaria ir por gusto, hacer faltar de clases a mi hija y perder un dia completo de trabajo. Por favor alguna respuesta? me presentaré pronto, pero me voy a molestar si voy a puro gusto perdiendo de trabajar para nada. Tengo nervios!< /text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I do not understand why on the page they place as a requirement to present only a birth certificate to be able to take out the passport and at the moment that one presents even preentandola they want the mother or father to be the applicant being an adult ?? And the person who attended unfortunately does not know the name of the woman does not seem Honduran because instead of helping one complicates it, not because of that great service 👏 with only that neither the telephone number put on the page for one to be able to do any question .. There is no doubt that it is still a garbage.

(Original)
No entiendo porque en la pagina colocan como requisito presentar solo una acta de nacimiento para poder sacar el pasaporte y al momento que uno se presenta aun preentandola quieren que vaya la mamá o el papá siendo el solicitante un adulto?? Y la persona que atendió lastimosamente no se el nombre de la mujer no parece hondureña porque en lugar de ayudar se la complica a uno, no pues que gran servicio 👏 con sólo que ni el número de teléfono ponen en la página para uno poder hacer alguna pregunta..

(Translated by Google) This is a shame, nobody updates information in the office or on the website. To go to get my passport I had to go everywhere from how to pay for the shipment. Nobody gives a complete information to one before going. There is not a cell number there and neither general where one can ask questions if you have doubts. My friends from other countries take everything very easy every time they go to their consulates. Then I go for birth certificates and they told me at the office that they do not give there and that I have to wait for the Mobil consulate to go to Las Vegas NV or ask for them from Honduras. It's ridiculous.

(Original)
Esto es una vergüenza, nadie actualiza información en oficina o en la página web. Para ir a sacar mi pasaporte tuve que ir a todos lados desde como pagar-asta el envío. Nadie le da una información completa a uno antes de ir. No hay un número de cell de ahí y tampoco general donde una pueda hacer preguntas si tiene dudas. Mis amigos de otros países optienen todo bien fácil cada ves que van a sus consulados. Luego voy por actas de nacimiento y me dijeron en la oficina que no ellos ahí no dan y que tengo que esperarme el consulado Mobil que valla a Las Vegas NV o pedirlas de Honduras. Es ridiculo.< /Text>

<text>They were able to fix up my rear bumper, just coming in very efficiently and helped me get back on the road safe without worrying about endangering others or cause a problem on the road itself. Very good service and would recommend if you ever got into an accident or had a body problem.</text>< pics>

It was my first time coming to his shop, and I will definitely return for any other bodywork/exhaust work that I need. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants their car done right. I will be sending my friends and  family there whenever they need the work he provides.</Text>

<text>The quality of work was excellent. You could never know any work was ever completed. This customer service was the best I have encountered in a really long time. Super efficient and excellent communication. Went above and beyond to drop me off at the car rental place so I didn't have to wait.<//text>< user>

<Text>Came here after reading all the reviews and I can say I agree with everyone 100%. I backed into a storage container and damaged up my back bumper. I was given a honest and fair price for the repair. My car was fixed in 4 days and I was extremely happy with the outcome. My car looks new! As if nothing was ever there was never any prior damage. I would HIGHLY recommend this place and have already spread the word to family members.< /Text>< username>

Robert and Julio took care of me today. I came in with a small problem. These guys took one look at my car and got to work on it right away. I was in and out. It’s hard now of days to find places that will truly help you out and at a reasonable cost. I highly recommend this place to anyone. Thanks again guys!< /review>

I recently bought a vehicle with plenty of paint damage and dents, Robert and his shop were able to restore the paint to be brand new! Furthermore, he was able to install new aftermarket parts and paint match them. Very honest service and great prices!! I would definitely recommend!< /Text>

Just got done at Menifee collision center and Robert fixed my back right bumper, and now it's properly aligned to where you can't even see that is was off. This is the best place to get your car repaired, and I highly recommend anyone who needs their car fixed to come here because the mechanics here really care about their customers and the community. Ask for Robert, and he will repair your vehicle better than any mechanic in town.</review>

<Time>1544661708324</Time><Response>None<//Response><user>102719407691550993458<//user><text>Having recently moved to the Menifee area, I wasn't in the know of where to take my vehicle when I needed repairs beyond my ability.  I started to search the web for a repair facility I could feel comfortable with.  After reading many various reviews from several shops, I continued to return to the Menifee Collision Center site.  I decided to go there to see for myself.  I was immediately met by Robert and when I explained my plight he took it in stride and went to look at my vehicle in order to make an estimate for my repairs.  He was very professional, to the point, and very respectful, at no time did I feel as though I was just another person at his door.  I was treated as a longtime customer and actually enjoyed our conversations.

I was treated well and, I believe, very fairly.  The job was completed sooner than I had expected and the charges, parts and labor, were very reasonable.  Even though I don't look forward to major vehicle repairs, if I have the need, I will certainly return to Menifee Collision Center seeking their help.</text></record>

<Review>This shop is great. I truly appreciate them letting me store my vehicle at their shop, although I couldn't afford to get my vehicle repaired. I can say that, they are amazing at fixing any damages. Definitely would recommend this shop to my friends and family and anyone else that may need collision repair services.

It's also a plus that Robert is a Libra... Libras are awesome! Go to  Menifee Collison!< /Review>< pictures>

Robert was very helpful and talked me through all my options until we arrived at something that fitted my budget.  I felt very comfortable leaving my car to be fixed.  He runs an efficient, transparent business. Highly recommended for anyone who doesn't know too much about cars and wants a fair deal!<//text>

<Review>Menifee Collision Center is the best place to take your car!  They do fantastic work, are very professional, and provide great service!  My son had just bought a new car and less than 2 weeks of owning it, he got involved in a parking lot accident.  Menifee Collision repaired and restored the car just like it came off the lot again!!  Because we were so happy with their work, I brought in my car to have it fixed as the dealer misdiagnosed it for months, and they replaced my axle and now it runs great!  No more noise!  They also replaced and painted a mirror cover that fell off my car.  Their prices are very reasonable and they are very accommodating!  You will not be disappointed by taking your car there.   Awesome job!  We'll be back!</Review>< pictures>

I experienced a minor accident with my 2017 Tesla S. Since Tesla does not do their own bodywork, this had created a problem finding a credible body repair shop. We searched the web and found Menifee Collision center and gave them a call. The best call I ever made since I had driven to several shops and they stated Tesla doesn't ship parts and it would take several weeks for the repair.

I then spoke to Robert, manager and one of the owners who said to come on in. Upon arriving Robert began his search for the part and volunteered to drive all the way to San Diego, CA 60 miles one way, to pick up the part personally. Wow! He also guarantees the repair in 3 days.

After 2 days he called me to pick up the Tesla. The work was done not only early, but but an excellent job was performed. He stated any problems, just bring back.

Htis company truly deserves all the positive reviews including mine. The service was outstanding only surpassed by the quality workmanship. Do you know he also picked me up and dropped me back home! Who does that today!

I will take my car to Menifee Collision center from now on for any body work. Dings, I dents, and I scratches, etc. They are truly the best and I am so overly satisfied by their work and service.

The best experience. Thanks Robert. See you soon!< /Review>

<text>I needed a new catalytic converter and called a bunch of places to shop around. This place had the best price. I saved like $130-$260 compared to other places. The guys were super nice and helpful. They totally understood the issue I was having and showed me on the computer so I could be sure I was getting the right part and were completely willing to explain things I asked about. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and would go back again!<//text><user_name>Caitlin Clarke<//user_name>< rating>

My family(4 of them) & I have been coming to MENIFEE COLLISION for almost 10years now !  That's an attribute to their GREAT SERVICE & EXCELLENT WORK!   ROBERT, the owner, won't steer you wrong.   He and his mechanics Always get the job done.
It seems like there's isn't ANY kind of Body Damage they can't fix.  Robert's honesty, integrity and experience is bar none!

<text>I had my F-150 painted from black to gray about three years ago at Menifee Collision Center and to this day the paint looks great. I recently was in a car accident where I was rear ended and I ended up hitting the vehicle in front of me because of how hard I was hit. My car had bumper and front end damage. I brought my car in and they took care of it within a week. The car looked great. These guys are extremely professional and honest in what they can accomplish. I have referred my family and friends to this shop. It is hard to find people that you can trust in this industry. These guys are great. I recommend this shop in your time of auto body needs.</text>< date>

<review>These guys are good. They worked on my Kia door with a great color match on the paint I was concerned since it was an older model but they got it! Julio even took a part to paint ahead of time and it saved me from having to leave my van there for longer than absolutely needed. I had a couple of fog lights to install on a second car and as we were talking he had them in just like that.  These guys are good and fast and they were affordable and it helped me. I live 20 miles away but I'll for sure go back.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Alex Garcia< /username>< resp>

Went down there the other day and got my truck exhaust done. Sounds great and couldn't be anymore happier. I recommend them ! They also fixed my buddies car after his car accident. Came out to be good as new.< /review>

My daughter took her car here for repair and I have to say Im extremely happy with not only the work they did but with the way they treated my 19 year old daughter!

I have had my car worked on at Julio's after 2 separate accidents and both times they were awesome! The final price ended up being less than the original estimate each time due to their ability to find parts at lower prices or discovering that some parts could be reused from before the wreck. They also had my car back to me earlier than I anticipated (a week or less both times)!!  They take the time to talk to you and really explain what is going on without talking down to you, which as is somewhat uncommon. This was especially important on my second visit where I was paying out of pocket and trying to decide what was absolutely necessary to replace. They are a family business and really do take great care of their customers<//Review>

I have been taking my cars to Julio for about 10 years now. His prices are very fair, and his work has always been perfect. I recommend him to all of my friends and family whenever they need body work or paint, and would recommend you to take your car there whenever you need bodywork.< /text>

Robert and Julio are amazingly accommodating!  Went in to see if they can do anything with my car door that’s been messed up for a couple years now.  Not only did they fix it right away, literally 30mins, but it was very affordable.  They assured that the door closes correctly and safely.  I was even surprised that they had remembered me from a previous visit.  Now that’s how you know they care about you. 😊<//Review>

Got into an accident, and I searched in the area for body shops in menifee, body shops in murrieta. I found this gem! This is the only place with an almost 100% 5 star rating on all platforms, and now I know why! I talked to Robert, who happens to be the owner, and he is super sweet and accommodating!  He had my car ready for me a few days ahead of the expected date, he worked with my insurance company and met with them to do the estimate. My car looks brand new! No one could even tell for a second that anything happened. Great work! Not kidding! Check them out for yourself. It is hard to come by a hard working, honest place.

This is the best auto body shop, ever, and I have had my handful of car wrecks! Honest, reliable, good pricing, great work, what more can you ask for? I will post before and after pics soon! Thank you Menifee Collision Center. Thank you Robert, and thank you Robert's brother, Julio for picking me up from my home to get my car, when I did not have a ride. Thank you for delivering ahead of schedule, and going that extra mile for your customers. It is people like you, who restore my faith in humanity. No kidding! Thank you!!!<//review>

I was referred to this shop by my sister. I brought my Camaro in it needed some body work and a paint job. The car went from a burgundy coat to a navy blue coat. Julio and Beto did a great job. The car looked new. The work was professionally done and fast. They have affordable prices. This has now become my go to shop for any type of body work needed. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

<Text>A very well maintained and clean shop.  They are experts in what they do.  At first coming to their place of business you are welcomed with the utmost professional courtesy.  Not too many shops within this business still have the customer’s best interest in mind, however not with Menifee Collision Center & Mufflers.  As a person that deals with training personnel to give top notch customer service within the military and in the civilian sector, I can honestly say after researching the best businesses within Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City and Hemet, Menifee Collision Center & Mufflers offers you first rate in service, price, and understanding in what your needs may be.  Moreover, when dropping off my vehicle to be serviced, they were concerned on how I would get home due to the fact that the service being done would take half the day.  Not only were they concerned, but more than one person was offering to give me a ride home and pick me up when the service was completed.  With that said, who still offers that kind of service?  Well, they do.  If you want piece of my mind that you will be taken care right, “GO” to this place and speak with Robert.  He is a true professional that will offer his expertise and forethought in what you are looking for. With people with this type of class and professionalism you can’t go wrong.  Thank you, Menifee Collision Center & Mufflers for your honesty and skill in making my vision of my 72’ Torino a reality.< /Text>< rate>

Julio was really hopefull and he had a tow truck on its way with in minutes free of charge . Once i met Julio and hes brother i had a good feeling that the car was in good hands . When the car was done i was impresed with the work i couldnt tell that this car had even been in an accident. Im glad i came here it was hassle free all i had to do was sing the Insuranse check and i was on my way<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Received a gift card and Spa Barona made the appt process easy via website. Walked into a really well decked out waiting room/gift shop. Loved that they had refreshments while you waited. Desiree was my person and she was so welcoming and friendly. I did my first hot stone massage and it was awesome! Also enjoyed reflexology massage as well. The changing room had these delicious chocolates! When I came out, the staff had brought out a lovely birthday surprise treat.....enjoyed a fruit tart while overlooking the golf course. I rarely give 5 stars as usually there is always room for improvement but for Spa Barona it was a stellar experience!! Can't wait to go back!< /Text>

One of the best spas I have ever been to. Customer service is top notch. Quiet, relaxing and enjoyable. Heidi is bar none the BEST massage therapist I have ever been to. I have been to massages around the world and she is number one! Julie is the most patient and friendly nail specialist! She is a perfectionist and if not done to her standards she redoes the nails. She paints like an artist! Try them, you will never want to go anywhere else!< /text>

Sara was professional, kind and thorough.  I loved everything about my facial!  My face looks amazing and she makes me wish I could have her prep my face everyday! The spa was equally beautiful and relaxing.  And all of the staff were especially kind and accommodating.  I'll be back. :)</text>

<review>I have been extremely tense and stressed the past month, my boyfriend decided we needed to go get couples massages last minute. We called same day, hours prior and they were able to accommodate our request . I got the deep tissue massage and let me tell you it was wonderful ! So relaxing, they listened exactly what our needs where and I feel 100 times better. The staff is so kind and they provided us with great customer service ! I will definitely be going back there, well worth the money !</review>< Pictures>

Wonderful experience

Fantastic service. I had the best haircut from Michelle, an excellent therapeutic massage from Dawn, and a relaxing facial from Sarah. The spa itself is very clean and comfortable, and they offer so many different services that you wouldn't think would be available at a casino/hotel spa.
I'll definitely go back the next time I visit Barona.<//Review>

Great service took very good care of myself and my wife for a couples massage. I had Heidi and my wife had Esther they are both very caring and respectful of our needs to become less tense.  This was my wife's first massage so she went with the sweetest relaxation massage she is now addicted to massages when previously said she hated them. They really did a great job I would definitely recommend this to friends and family .</Review>

<Text>I found the Spa services and all the lovely and attentive specialists became the highlight of my stay at the Barona Resort.
My Oxygen  Facial with Vanessa has left my skin looking and feeling amazing. And days later the effects are being noticed.
I would highly recommend this Spa to everyone.
Thank you especially to Nancy.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Purchased  a groupon for a couple's massage.   Both my husband and I really enjoyed our massages.   The only reason I didn't give the facility 5 stars is the lack of amenities (steam room,  jacuzzi, etc).  I would completely recommend purchasing a massage,  especially with a coupon.<//Review>< pictures>

Wow! What can I say? EXCELLENT, UNBELIEVABLE, SUPER!!! I have to admit, usually I leave the spa treatments, massages and all that stuff to my fiance. But she talked me into getting a couples massages amd I must say it was the greatest experirnce Ive ever had. The staff at Ambience Day Spa is excellent...beyond excellent. And the massage?? Oh wow!! Lets just say that I may have a new habit. They are truly professional and definitely worth it. Dont cheat yourself, Treat yourself! Give em a try.
THANKS AMBIENCE!!!!!!< /text>

< Review>
Xyclo began serving banh mi during the pandemic and they are *excellent*. The best vegetarian banh mi I've had in the Bay Area. The addition of mushroom and sweet potato add a nice complexity to the fried tofu. They're not particularly cheap at $7.95, but they are tastier and more substantial than most. Unless you're really hungry, you can stretch one into two meals. You can also add a Thai tea or Vietnamese coffee for $2, which helps offset the sandwich price. Both are really good.< /Review>

One of my all time favorites in Oakland/Berkeley. The food is consistently excellent. During the pandemic, they have take out. During normal times, the dining room is really pleasant. And they have really good cocktails!< /text>

Great place right next to Fenton's Creamery. They have really terrific fish and their spring rolls were fantastic. Highly recommend if you are in the area.</Text>

We really liked their Sugarcane Shrimp rolls. The Claypot Rice Medley--chicken and veggies over rice was delicious. Tumbling Dice -- filet mignon over a salad-- was expensive and not as good as the previous two dishes. The ambience of this restaurant is very pleasant, service was excellent. This was our first visit and we will return.<//text>

Their spring rolls are awesome but often the beef is chewy. I find this a good place for lunch. Relatively fast service and fair prices for what you get. It's not the best but it's the best within a four-block area.<//Text>

The Buddha role was absolutely delightful with a surprise crunch inside which came from a rolled and baked spring roll wrapper. Sweet potato apple and cucumber made it even better. Best looking and tasting papaya salad as well. Many dishes are veg and all can be made vegan< /review>< Date>

Unfortunately we never made it past the menu for two major reasons. The first is that the place is really nickel and dining its customers. They don’t offer glasses of water, they charge you for cake cutting, uncorking, for parties over a certain amount, and for splitting checks, that’s all stated clearly on the menu which honestly isn’t inviting at all. Especially when you look at the prices of the dishes and they’re all in the $17 to $25 range which is a good $10 more per dish than most restaurants on piedmont ave. Secondly the selections didn’t even look very good, nothing caught our eye. We ended up going somewhere else. I’m not sure how this place will thrive when there are so many other more affordable restaurants nearby that are more welcoming to customers</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Great local vietnamese  food. Xyclo is a cozy place to grab a lite lunch or dinner. I highly recommend the spring rolls especially the sugar cane roll.</review>

This place is not a traditional vietnamese place. It is fusion so don't expect it the Pho to be amazing.  The rest of the food is just great.  We love the crispy rice hot pot and there is a steak dish that we can't get enough of.  My wife love the lychee martini.< /Review>

Consistently excellent food!  Take all out-of-town foodie guests here.  Upon returning to town, guests always ask to go to Xyclo and I am always glad to go. Simply the best food/price value.</review>

<text>I purchased some shocks for my truck for over $500 dollars they said they had two in stock the other at another store. I said I'll come back for the the full set in the morning. Went home did my research there $200 online in several websites I showed this to CLAY the salesman man says NOPE CANT DO THAT BUT I WILL CHARGE YOU A RESTOCKING FEE. My advice is go to another autopart store where you can feel like your not going robbed. If I could give cero stars I will. I put my receipt so you can see it's true. Oh yeah the shock price was from summit internet price nice try trying to get out of this one thiefs< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5wybMfJRXa9jSIZXecdrur77pcWKuXzYVX8ls=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1552917100132, 'text': 'Venancio, we apologize for the misunderstanding you experienced at our store. However, the KYB shocks were a special order item and the prices were competitive with all other local Auto Parts stores. Unfortunately it can be difficult to match online prices when manufactures do not price protect their produts for their primary distributors. It is noted on our invoices regarding a restocking charge on all special orders.

<review>Excellent service Scotty is a class act I go there because he knows what he is doing it's because he cares about people.
On more than one occasion I saw him show disrespect to a Vietnam veteran who used to work there driving the parts truck I don't think that was cool. I'm a female customer that's been going there for years but not after I witnessed that<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1605623544171, 'text': 'Thanks for taking time to write a review, Robert.

Work with these guys daily and I couldn't be happier. If they dont have it on the shelf they'll usually have it by the end of the day. Or at least have the experience and knowledge to find a decent alternative for any of your automotive needs.</Text>

Quality Parts. Usually a level higher than your Standard Auto Parts stores. Can usually find hard to get stuff there. Especially with my older jeeps and vehicles. It's nice to have them in my small town of Lucerne Valley. Thank you</text>

These people are always the best... Must come down from the owner (locally owned) remember just because it's a Brand name dosnt mean your treated like a number.

They will either order or send you to one of there other locations (4 in HD) , also will let you know where to find a part if NAPA doesn't carry the item.</review>

We called before we got there, staff came out as we arrived in front of the store, helped out checking my car to get correctly sized snow chains. They also showed us videos of each snow chain installing instructions to help us decide witch one to buy. The only drawback is that, we find out later, their price is about twice as much as other places. I guess the service worth the price in some ways.</Text>

<Text>Checked all over town for the seals we needed, only they had them.  I accidentally left my phone on the counter when I was paying.  The next day I called and asked if they had my phone and they said, "YES," I couldn't have been happier.  They said my phone was locked or they would have called me.  Thanks Napa Auto Parts, you made my day ☺️<//Text>< gmapID>

Napa is independently franchised, I've had a lot of problems with this particular store, I've bought parts that were lifetime and then they tell you its only 1 year warranty when you bring the part in, I've heard from many people to watch out with this particular store, no wonder the owner owns the largest house in Apple Valley, even bigger and higher than his neighbor Cooley, the Owner of Cooley Construction</Review>

<text>I put myself in a terrible financial position. Instead of exploiting my extreme spending tendencies and putting me further into a downward spiral, Simple Path Financial rescued me from myself. They provided an excellent path for me to follow to assist with getting my life back on track. The process was fast, efficient and simple. The representatives I spoke with were all very professional, non-judgemental, helpful and courteous. Thank you Kyle!!< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I spoke with Christopher M. and he was so helpful and patient! He was very thorough and gave me different plan options that would suit me. I’ve been trying to pay off my debt for years and felt like I was not getting anywhere! Most of my pay check would go to paying this debt off. I am excited to finally start overcoming this debt!<//review>

As painful as I expected, it wasn't!  Brett Mazur is a consummate professional.   I dreaded the thought of making this choice at 62 yrs. old and both my wife and I are struggling ex-professionals dealing with current events. It made sense after explained.  Unable to retire and actively searching, there is a glimmer at the end of the tunnel.  I thank you all and hope I can hold up my end of the bargain. Quoting a favorite; "Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore..."<//review>

<Review>I had a very enjoyable experience with Simple Path Financial 's representative named Michael. When I called after receiving my letter in the mail I had the pleasure of talking to Michael. He explained the program to me and told me how beneficial it would be for me to get my bills paid off in a shorter time than normal. I have placed money in my account for the program to begin. This is the first month and so far so good.  Michael is available to me for any questions I have. Thank you Michael for helping to put me on the right financial path to a debt free future.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>I was simply curious about the low interest rates advertised and the guy who called, Brent, was abrupt, rude, pushy, argumentative, and treated me like he was doing me a favor.  I'd say that if you go here you need to be prepared for an uncomfortable experience.  Also, expect to get called and emailed incessantly for your private information rather than answering your questions.  Just didn't feel right to me.<//text>< response>

My consultant, Randy, was very proficient in outlining where I was financially and how soon he could help me become debt free.   This company has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau.  I believe in this company.  They can do the job of negotiating with your creditors.< /Review>

I have been pleasantly surprised so far. Thomas has been very knowledgeable and helpful in this process. It is kind of early and I hope to come back and give a more thorough review couple of months down the road. I look forward to breaking free from the chains of debt in the next few years instead of 30 years!</Review>

<review>Simple Path Financial is totally awesome. I was just biding my time with my credit card payments. After broken appliances, deaths in my family, paying for funerals, and hurricanes from 2020, I over extended myself and I knew it. I was making minimum payments on my bills just waiting to go under. So I saw SPF online and filled out my information. Not 25 hours later I started getting emails and phone calls. These guys are amazing. They wasted no time letting me know they could help me. It was an answer to my prayers. They sent me all the paperwork so I could understand what they would be doing for me. I am so glad I did this. No one wants to lose everything and start over. I am so thankful they had a solution for me. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I will forever be grateful! Thank you so much Spencer L for reaching out to me. I am a hard person to get into contact with because of my job. I am so glad you didn’t give up.<//review><userid>105640624454486297894< /userid><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

I spoke with Mr. Miller concerning combining some credit card debt at a lower interest rate.  But because I had a high debt to income he advised me to take a look at another program that they had, which serve me better. I mentioned to him that I had been burn by so many other people I was a little leery.  He provided me some assurance that their company are real and is equip to assist me with getting debt free over 4 years. So I felt comfortable with him.  So I enrolled in the program.</Text>

David M. was my contact. He was very patient with me and kept in contact until I made up my mind. He was very clear in his explanations and very professional. I'm still a little nervous as I just today entered the program. However, after watching several of the videos I am reassured. Thank you for the opportunity to change my financial life around.< /Text>

The only place that got me approved! When others denied me, I was able to take care of my needs, the rate was on the higher based on the amount of debt I already owed and gentlemen explained to me if you are going to take the loan just pay it off as soon as you can. Very honest and professional!<//text>

My experience with this company was deplorable. I received a letter in the mail saying I had been pre-approved for a loan. When I called about it, I specifically asked if they offer programs that encourage people to NOT pay their bills on time, let the bills get behind, then work with creditors for lower payoffs, then they pay off the companies. The woman I spoke to said they only offer personal loans to applicants. I indicated that I did not want my application submitted if this was an option; she said it was not.
WELL - when she called back to let me know that they could only offer me a program that will pay off negotiated creditor. I do not recommend this company to ask for a personal loan.</Text>

< review>
Alex and the entire BioSport staff have been a wonderful experience for many of my patients. As a physician, I get a lot of positive feed back from those patients that I refer. Personally I have also benefited from therapy provided by Alex and his staff. I highly recommend BioSport to everyone interested in staying fit and needing to rehab any ailments.<//review>

< review>
I exercise regularly (run, walk, golf, yoga, weights, etc.) but every couple of years would have a debilitating back injury that would lay me up for several weeks.  This last time I vowed to address the root causes, and came to BioSport for treatment and insights.  Brittany has been an AMAZING therapist.  She carefully assessed my historical injuries, helped me understand the muscle groups responsible for preventing future episodes, and continues to evolve my exercise plan as we go.  THANK YOU!</review>

My injuries were full body but I went to therapy for my legs. They also identify areas that I was unaware that needed work until they pointed it out, I was so focused on walking I didn't focus on any other part of my body. Once they brought it to my attention, I was able to start therapy on that area. The whole team is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and very professional.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Super friendly and clean environment. After recently having my rotator cuff and a bicep tendon repaired my surgeon referred me to BioSport and I am extremely happy he did. Recovery after my surgery has been so much easier with the help of everyone at BioSport. I am so grateful for everyone there and how they have helped get my shoulder back to normal. I can now workout and do everyday things without being in pain.

<Review>I can't say enough about Alex and the team he has assembled at BioSport on Spyres way.  I whole hardly recommend BioSport to everyone.  I have personally seen small miracles in my own healing.
Alex worked on me personally and made sure my therapy session were challenging... while I always leave feeling stretched/worked out, i love the greater feeling of progress toward healing that I have experienced.
You don't  have to take me at my word... come and be amazed

<review>I love this place.  I have a hard time on my own starting an exercise program. Coming here has gotten me on a better routine to exercise on a daily basis now. I’m trying to relieve my back pain with the new 40 watt laser. Bottom line:
I don’t want to have to go through surgery again
I’m coming here twice a week for now. I  recommend anyone that is having any type of pain to try this place out.  By the way:  the staff are excellent. They know their stuff. :)<//review>< Pictures>

I have nothing but good things to say about BioSport Physical Therapy! The environment is clean and well equipped with a friendly and knowledgeable staff. I especially enjoyed my therapist Dr. Alan Mallory. He was pleasant, friendly, and really worked me through my physical limitations striving for significant improvement with each session. I can see and feel the improvement and I would not hesitate to recommend anyone to BioSport and to Dr. Alan Mallory.</review>

Alex and the staff are very knowledgeable and caring.  I have a chronic shoulder issue that can be quite painful at times.  They always take the time to check in with me and figure out what is the best plan for each session.  I, also, recently started having laser therapy on my shoulder and it has helped my inflammation tremendously and my pain level.  I will continue to come here long term.< /Review>

BioSport is a perfect combination of professionalism and a friendly upbeat atmosphere. Alex and the staff are great at giving everyone individual attention. The equipment is hands down the most advanced I have seen in town. They also have an amazing variety of equipment that is constantly kept clean.

On Tuesday I tweaked my knee and couldn’t walk or put weight on it without intense pain and fear of it buckling. I went into BioSport on Wednesday, and Dr. Alex and team started laser therapy and recommended heat and ice at home. He determined it was a sprained MCL, and after 3 days of this treatment the healing was accelerated and I am now walking with only a slight limp!  The whole staff made me feel welcome, comfortable, and cared for. They’re a very fun team that really cares and knows what they’re doing. Thanks BioSport!< /Text>

I have received excellent physical therapy for back issues and very much appreciate the outstanding service provided by the therapists -K.D., Angie, Christian, Strav, Melissa and more -they all are so knowledgeable and treat me and others respectfully.  Their enthusiastic approach is contagious and the environment is so welcoming that I look forward to going to sessions and noticing improvement.  I highly recommend BioSport to anyone needing PT!!< /review>

<Review>When I first came to BioSport, I was in so much pain that I wanted to die. After my first visit I was able to sleep through the night (without excruciating pain) for the first time in months. Every staff member - from the office staff, assistants, and physical therapists - is super encouraging and fun. The atmosphere is so positive and uplifting that it makes me want to come - even when I know it will be hard work. They know just the right balance of pushing and encouraging you without breaking you. Thanks to each of you for helping me heal.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Over the years I have been to many Physical Therapists for various conditions. The PT that cares for me at BioSport is knowledgeable, professional, friendly and personally interested in improving the quality of my life. The attention he shows to each therapy speaks to his commitment to his patients. The team of technicians is also professional and attentive. I would highly recommend BioSport Physical Therapy.</Text>

If you're here to decide on which physical therapy group to choose: search over!  BioSport is a well thought out facility staffed with very friendly, professional people who work together like a seasoned ballet company.  The atmosphere they've created is genuinely warm and welcoming. It's very refreshing to find medical professionals who actually WANT to cure, not medicate.</text>

<text>The entire staff at BioSports is professional and well trained. Their entire focus is on getting you on your feet and healthy so you can enjoy life to it’s fullest. I’ve been to other physiotherapist in the past and none of them have come close to what you get at BioSports. Give it a try, you won’t be disappointed.

🙏 THANK YOU 🙏 A month ago I arrived at BioSport, with pain and swelling on the left side of my shoulder and neck.
Thanks to the exercises, massages ciones attention and a lot of help from everyone, I recovered my health.
I am very grateful to ALEX and his entire team, who are very kind and professional and helped me with the therapies to be much better when I arrive, for their treatment and attention, since since they treated me in the office one feels comfortable,  since it is a pleasant environment that gives confidence.
Today I can say without a doubt THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL ❤️

Overall it is a great environment and they have an excellent team. Everyone there is very supportive and are focused on dealing with the physical issues that seem to be bothering us. Personally I had trouble with walking after a serious accident and i felt like I wouldn’t be able to walk normally. Here at biosport they offered allot of support and they took really good care of me. I always felt like I could get back to walking normally because they show and a huge amount of support and care. It not easy recovering from this type of injury but they never want to make me give up which is why  I always enjoy my time there.</Text>

If your looking for a Physical Therapist, BioSport has plenty. My therapist is KD, and he is very nice, friendly, and most importantly very knowledgeable. I have been going for 2months now and have seen vast improvements following my ankle surgery. All the staff, aids, trainers, and assistants are also very nice and helpful. I do recommend this location for anyone who is looking to heal quickly.</review>

I had knee surgery and my Doctor recommended them. I went to my first visit six days after surgery. I was afraid, I felt it was too soon but it was a good  decision. Alan and the whole crew were there for me. they practically  showed me how to walk again. As the weeks passed they intensified my work outs, my leg gained full range of motion and it got stronger and stronger.  I actually had a lot of fun, everybody is very friendly there. Thanks everyone!<//text>

If I could describe my experience at Biosport in one word I would have to say phenomenal. This group of physical therapists and assistants do the absolute best for you to help achieve your goal. I came in with crutches and three visits later I ditched them and have been walking without them. I also love how one on one they really are with each and every patient. The positive environment they have makes physical therapy like a casual day at he gym. Thank you to everyone in Biosport Physical Therapy, I am beyond happy that I was referred to come here.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Bio-Sport has a great environment to get healthy again. Alex and his crew are professional and thorough in all aspects of physical therapy.
Alex has an “all in” attitude about our recovery which encourages me to recover from my injury.
If you’re thinking about where to go, make it easy on yourself and go to Bio-Sport!

Thank you Dr. KD and BioSport's awesome team for the best ACL recovery experience!! I loved the 1on1 approach and that treatment plans were very personalized with creative exercises that were tailored to me. And the gym is brand new and soooo clean! Shoutout to the aides- Christian, Bavik, Strat, Shawn, and Odette for making each visit so fun, with lots of motivation and great energy.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Where to begin?!!?... I LOVE BIOSPORT across the board, the people, the atmosphere, the energy, the motivation, and most of all, the unique experiences that the personal approach at BioSport provides.

I remember the first day I came in late with my twins due to the last-minute babysitter cancelation. Suzzette welcomed my energetic boys into her office with toys and treats that allowed me quiet time with my therapist, Dr. KD. One great impression after another, Dr. KD was kind, knowledgeable with a great bedside manner. He meticulously explained through my shoulder pain assessment and treatment plan. The rest is just history filled with many unique experiences and happy shoulders. I 'll be missing this positive-filled family when my shoulders are all healed up.

This place earns my highest recommendations as a place to get your body healed and healthy again.</Text></record>

<review>I've been coming to BioSport for physical therapy for awhile due to chronic pain issues. Everyone is very friendly, caring, professional and encouraging.  I have worked with both Dr. Alex and Dr. Koree; both phenomenal physical therapists especially because of my unique issues.  Dr. Alex is always thinking "outside the box" to relieve my pain and help strengthen me at the same time. Christian, Strat, Tony, Brittanee, Sean, Georgina and all the aides and physical therapists and office staff are amazing! They make me smile each and every time I am there. They always me feel like I am "fixable," and I don't have to settle with "chronic." If you're looking for a place to hep you rehabilitate an injury or deal with aches, pains, or balance or simply just to help you strengthen and prevent injuries this is the place to come!  Best PT in Modesto in my opinion! Thank you BioSport for all you do!  Keep up the good work and making a difference in the lives of your patients!<//review><gmapID>0x809056a6075b5743:0x913e8b8d7f415619<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been turned away by several companies and personal trainers because of my injuries because I just want to run again. There was no hesitation with Biosport PT, they took me on full force and dove right in my first visit. Alex and the rest of the staff were so friendly and welcoming and I felt like I have a whole team on my side to see me through. I’m so blessed to have found this place. I’m confident I will be running soon with their help!<//Text>

I have been doing physical therapy on and off for years. I have been to most of the physical therapy offices in Modesto since 2003. When I started at Biosport I assumed it was going to be like the other offices, but I was wrong. Leo and Alex have provided me with one on one specialized care and knowledge, so I can understand my body mechanics and treat myself appropriately. Living with pain is no fun and very limiting, but the one on one care Biosport provides allows you to live your life. The PT Assistants are also hands on and a great support. They provide a warm and friendly environment for your to relax and heal. I have been recommending Biosport to my friends and family for years. If you are hesitant then just go in for a consultation and you will understand that Biosport is where you should have your treatment.</review>

If you go to physical therapy Biosport is the way to go.  The professional staff, fantastic healthy environment, new clean equipment make getting better an enjoyable experience.  The knowledgeable staff tailor a program for your recovery then stay by your side for each session.

They have laser therapy that works  like a miracle.  My neck and back were injured nothing seemed to help, until Biosport used their laser.
This painless therapy provided relief the first time, I can't imagine life without one.  Their is much more to Biosport you will have to find out for yourself.< /Review>

Biosport is amazing! Before Biosport I had never been to physical therapy and had no idea what to expect. The staff at Biosport makes me feel very comfortable and important. Everybody has made me feel that I belong and that I am truly valued. They have eased my worries about my injury and assured me that they would make me stronger. It's awesome that the PT's have enough time to work individually with their patients every single visit. My knee pain has reduced significantly since I've started my therapy. I am able to live my life and engage in activities with very minimal pain. Koree is an exceptional therapist who keeps all of her patients entertained while she works with them. She has an amazing sense of humor which makes me look forward to my visits every week.</Review>

<Review>Alex was very professional and found the source of my pain quickly. He explained the source of the pain and the exercises I would do to help strengthen my shoulder in a way that was easy to understand. He was very thorough and I experienced a greater range of motion after only one visit.  He sent me home with exercises to do and a web site to log on to so that I could review the exercises. I didn't realize there would be full video and explanation online too, which is fantastic and really helps me to remember what position to keep my arm, shoulder, hand, etc. in.  If you need a physical therapist, I HIGHLY recommend Biosport!< /Review><username>Kristy Lawrence<//username>< Gmap_id>

It's been 5 months and now I'm back after surgery. So far so good. Alex working out the kinks for me and I'm looking for a fast and full  recovery on my shoulder. Key is continue to work on exercises at home. BioSport sends you off with a full set of instructions and link to a site where all are explained with video examples.

The Bio Sport team is knowledgeable, courteous and well organized with new updated equipment. Unlike other PT companies I have been to, they do not base your appointment on time, they base it on results.<//review>

BioSport offers the BEST Physical Therapy I have ever had! They have a caring and knowledgeable staff. I’m learning to walk again with my cane. I had a second spine surgery and was in a wheelchair for about 2 months.  My physical therapist is Dr. Alan. He is the BEST!
The treatment is one on one.

Biosport became a vital part of my self-care starting fall of 2019.  I began to experience bad shoulder pain and could not play catch with my boys.  Someone recommended Dr Koree Ringer, so I scheduled an appointment.  She effectively addressed my shoulder pain by educating me on the problem, her own rehabbing, and assigning me home rehab exercises.  My shoulder works again and I enjoy a lot of sports time with my boys.  I can't thank her and her assistant Tony enough.  Recently, in the last couple months, I returned to see Dr. Koree for lower back pain.  As before, she is helping me understand my problem and rehabbing me through her own work and my take home work.  I am seeing results that encourage me to think my lower back won't own me.  I must emphasize that the results are in the homework Dr Koree gives me.  Basically, I must create a new way of life that incorporates a regimen of stretches and exercises in my day.  Discipline brings freedom; freedom of motion and lifestyle.  You need people to form this discipline in you and hold you accountable to it.  That is what Biosport and Dr. Koree have provided to me and for this I am very grateful.</text>

Talk about first impressions! Dr Alan did that! He is Laser focus and ready to work. I came in with Sciatica Pain that was next level. I needed assistance to get around and I used a cane. I felt like my life was over, but Biosport Physical Therapy gave me hope. Dr Alan listened to my concerns and knew exactly what to do. He would tweak my treatment as needed to best help me. Fast forward 6 months I feel better than Ever!! Strong and I trust my body to do it’s thang! If you wanna see real results I highly recommend you visit Biosport. From Dr Alan to the PT assistants & receptionist staff... they are the real deal & did I mention professional!!

Thank you Dr Alan so much for giving me my life back!!<//text>

This is my second encounter with Biosport. I have been to other physical therapists in the area and Biosport is by far and away the best. My issues are never trivial and each one has been handled with care and professionalism of the highest order. The customer service is of the highest caliber and I am once again strong and healthy thanks to their diligence and care. Thank goodness for Biosport!< /text>

<Text>Absolutely a five star experience every time I go in, which is twice a week.  I have had physical therapy in different cities and states,  all of which were the same, until now.  My PCP referred me to Alex at BioSport because of his diagnostic capabilities.  And, boy, was she right.

Their customer service is over the top.  Everyone calls me by name and knows what I need. They are encouraging, not pushy.  I had a physical therapist in another city once who refused to stop when I said he was hurting me. When I returned couple days later badly bruised, he left the room fighting back the tears. Hopefully, he learned something.  That will NEVER happen at BioSport.  They are, quite simply, the best.

I could go on and on, but if you have a condition that requires treatment, ask your physician for a referral.  Check with your insurance and see what's covered. With Medicare and good supplementary coverage, I don't pay a thing.  No insurance? No problem.  Talk to BioSport to see what they can do for you.

Due to Covid-19, BioSport requires that everyone  wear a mask, and closely adheres to all CDC safety requirements including sanitizer stations, equipment sanitized after use, gloves and masks on staff, etc. No issues to date!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1598469358734<//Date></record></dataset><record>

It wasn't until recently I went to my doctor and he referred me to BioSport. On my first visit I received laser therapy and the pain in my back immediately felt better. I have been continuing to go to BioSport to receive physical therapy and the atmosphere there is amazing. Everyone is so nice and personable. I highly recommend going to BioSport.

Back for hip issue 2/23/21  I have to have hip replacement surgery.  Dr Alex went through my x-ray and discussed my issues.  The plan is to get my muscles around both hips in good shape so after surgery it will take less time to recoup.  You Rock Doc.</text>

The new place is very spacious and well equipped.  My Physical Therapist, Korrie ( I’m sorry if I mutilated her spelling) is wonderful!  Not only is she knowledgeable. She is also empathetic- while throwing in some (MUCH APPRECIATED) devilish humor to help ease tension (pun intended!!! ) and pain!

I look forward ( kind of! 😉) to spending the next few weeks with you all<//text>

I'm so happy to write a review of my experience at Biosport ... the care and concern they demonstrate for their patients is OUTSTANDING ... I've had the pleasure of working with most of the therapists and can best describe them as "WICKED SMART" ... I'm amazed at the measurable progress I've made in just one month ... I would recommend Biosport to anyone who is looking to find a great therapist to recover after surgery ... anyone who is looking for pain management .... anyone who is looking to heal a sports injury ... I'm so grateful I took advantage of one of their free seminars ... I signed up after a consultation ... its the best thing I've done for my health and well being ... go and see them ... you will be just as impressed as I am ...<//text>

The staff are all welcoming, courteous, fun,  and respectful of age, disabilities, and physical pain. Therapist are helpful and readily available for help.  They push individual limits to ensure increasing muscle strength and flexibility, but do not encourage stretching those limits beyond personal safety concerns.  I leave each session feeling energized and find I have increasing control over my movement and flexibility.<//Text>

I have been coming to this practice for over a year now for different physical ailments. I have had interactions with nearly all the staff, and they are all very wonderful. Alex has been my therapist most of my time here, and he has definitely helped me in some pretty painful moments. I can honestly say that I enjoy physical therapy because of BioSport. This place is like a family, which you can see in their relationships with each other and with clients. I wouldn’t choose any other PT but this one. I’ve been to some others throughout California in my lifetime, and none of them has  been more enjoyable, or gotten me better results, than this place.</Text>

<review>Awsome staff!  From the front to the back of the house.  They are highly motivated and highly dedicated in providing an awsome therapy session.  I like how everyone work as a team providing a positive atmosphere.  When Im having a bad day they always got me leaving with a positive attitude.  I been suffering with chronic pain for over 15 year's and they been able to help alleviate my pain and manage it.  They also educate you the reason why your in pain.  They are very knowledgeable in there profession.

Thanks to Alex, Brittany and Staffs.</review>< Date>

<Text>How do I begin, I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis about a decade ago. The oral meds subscribed to me to manage my pain were beginning to cause issues with my liver, so I stopped the oral meds.
Years ago I had experience laser treatments that were beneficial to my discomforts and pains. I asked my Chiropractor if he knew of a place where they had laser treatments and he referred me to BioSports PT. All of the employees that I have met were very knowledgeable and equally as nice.
They reached out to my primary Doctor and were able to get me approved for treatments.
Now with exercise, manipulation of my muscles and laser treatments I feel like a new person.
I would highly recommend anyone in pain to their facility. They ask what ails me and work on my issues.
AS is an arthritis that can be very painful and crippling. I’ve found a happy place that hears and helps me with the many different areas that have been effected by this disease. I now feel we’re on top of maintaining the quality of my life. I can’t say enough about how helpful these treatments have been to my livelihood. They have been a Godsend to me.< /Text>< Pics>

Alex and his entire team are fantastic! They make each minute count. The laser light therapy is amazing!! In just 2 visits I have more range of motion and less pain in my hip. They also do therapy with my son. Alex makes it a point to really keep my 9 year old engaged and challenged. What therapist do you know that will take a client outside to do sprints and running?! 5 stars all the way!! I HIGHLY recommend Biosport for physical therapy!!<//Text>

<review>I started with Biosport last year after an extended illness. Korie, DPT and the rest of the amazing staff helped give me my life back. The knowledge and support given by the staff is unremarkable. I never knew how much PT could help change my life for the better. I’d recommend this place to family, friends...anyone. I can’t thank them enough.< /review>< time>

Biosport consists of a really great group of people that take your well being seriously. All in an environment that feels like home. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff and even more importantly, the results.

Coming from a  patient who has dealt with chronic back pain for most of his adult life, I can say that I have achieved significant relief in a relatively short amount of time. As with any review of this nature, your condition will likely determine your outcome.

Overall, Biosport has earned a bees knees five star rating.<//Text>

<review>My experience have been more than just a rehab program, Nicole, Tony, Dr Alex and everyone in general have been committed and compromised on everyone's rehabilitation, especially they make you feel in family and really care for you.  You are not just a patient more. I have a special bonding with every single one of them, because when everything pointed at that I was going to be stuck in my Disability everybody help me to came across that and change the odds.

BioSport is perfect for me.  They are open late during the week and on Saturdays.  I chose them for their hours but soon realized it was the best choice from the staff to the treatment Dr. Alex knows is great!!!</review>

At BioSport the staff is friendly and caring. The therapist made me feel very comfortable. They were  knowledgeable and professional. And pushed me when I needed to be pushed to get the mobility back. Thank you BioSport!</Text>

A great place for therapy. Staff is awesome and friendly. You are educated on the purpose, course and goals for your specific needs. Full circle treatment, rehab and wellness is just an appointment away.  I wish this place could established as an optional alternative on an elective basis (versus doctor referral). Love you guys!<//review>

BioSport has been a godsend in helping me alleviate my balance and dizziness issues. Their Physical Therapists are amazing professionals and extremely skilled and compassionate in treating my issues. I had tried everything I could think of over the past few years and had about given up in finding any relief but am so thankful I found BioSport to give me tremendous relief so I can remain safe as I age. Plus I enjoy the staff who is so upbeat and positive.  I highly recommend BioSport!< /Text>

Through a recommendation by my son I started with BioSport about a year ago & haven’t regretted going with BioSport. The staff have helped me tremendously with negating my daily pain in my neck, shoulders & back that I have suffered with for over 30 years due to a work injury. I even enjoy going due to the great staff that I have been working with!! I highly recommend BioSport for their integrity.
Thank you BioSport.< /Review>

I came to rehab my torn meniscus that I had underwent surgery for from a pickup game of basketball. The staff are extremely friendly, welcoming, upbeat, and joyful. I was assigned to Christian to work on strengthening exercises for my right knee. Christian was awesome to work with and is very positive and encouraging. We did a lot of creative workouts (general strengthening and agility/basketball routines) that challenged me but were also very fun at the same time. I also worked with Alex who was super friendly and affirming. I really appreciated how easy it was to talk to the staff at BioSport. I did not feel like a burden when I asked a lot of questions about my recovery process. I really enjoyed working with both Christian and Alex. Their upbeat personalities make the physical therapy workouts/exercises fun and something I really looked forward to during the week. I also appreciated the fact that the staff at BioSport are genuine and truly want you to get better. They will also help challenge you, within your own capabilities and limits of course, to get you on a path to full recovery. The hours of operation are also great and really flexible for people who have busy work schedules like me. I am very grateful for the experience, help, encouragement, and support I received from BioSport. They helped me get back to playing basketball again, something I absolutely love to do. I would definitely recommend BioSport Modesto to anyone!!!<//Text>< pictures>

Was sent here for my post-op therapy and I couldn’t be more happier to be here. My second post-op for meniscus tears and this experience has been night and day. Dr. Alex is very professional, friendly and approachable. He’s gone above and beyond to help me recover. His staff is always cheerful, friendly, and makes you feel like your right at home. Honestly, I actually look forward to my therapy sessions.< /Review>

I really cannot recommend or thank these guys enough! Great Atmosphere with a super knowledgeable and friendly staff! Leo is great at what he does and really shows interest in each individual patient. He genuinely cares about helping you get better. He even watched videos of me at work to help break down areas that where adding to my pain and ways we could could improve it! His one on one approach and attention to details are unmatched by anyone else I've dealt with for my pain!  Biosport Physical Therapy has helped me feel better both physically and mentally! I'm extremely thankful I stopped in! Do yourself a favor and make an appointment!< /Review>

I started physical therapy @ BioSports four weeks ago and today was my last day.... 😥 I was so tight around my shoulders and neck area; that in the beginning I was in a lot of pain doing the exercises. By the second week, I felt a big difference. All the staff are so nice, welcoming and passionate in what they do. Dr. Koree and her team helped me get my strength and my upper motion back. I’m not 100% yet, but I feel so much better. I loved the massages and the laser treatments, and all the bells and whistles that come with the sessions. Everything that the gym has, they have. My last day I was on TRX doing strength training. Now I feel more confident going to the gym and keeping up with the exercises they taught me. I feel stronger and I notice physic and tone in my back. I highly recommend this place and I can’t wait to go back for my knee. I've gone to other physical therapist and by far this is the best one.< /Text>

<review>Dr Leo is very knowledgeable and takes his time to fully understand your condition in order to provide you with the best treatment possible. He has helped me tremendously in the battle to relieve my pain from chronic condition and has used a plethora of methods that nobody has ever suggested before. I can't recommend this practice enough if you are looking for up-todate therapies and professionalism, including the office staff that works with your schedule and always helpful.

<GmapID>0x809056a6075b5743:0x913e8b8d7f415619</GmapID><Text>WOW! My Sciatica that I've had for over 20 years is finally gone. Leo and Alex are the therapists and they know their stuff! Leo was my physical therapist and was fabulous. He would always educate me and would pull up 3D Anatomy diagrams and pictures to help me understand what the cause of my pain was. I was taught exercises and given manual therapy that helped me to be rid of my pain. I came to a free workshop to learn about back pain and decided to sign up for therapy. After working with Leo I'm glad I made the decision to do something about my pain instead of trying to mask it with prescription drugs or cortisone shots. I actually made the choice to invest in my future and health. I learned which muscles to strengthen and which positions aggravated my symptoms. My Sciatica pain has always flared up to 9/10 and 10/10 and I've gone to the ER because of the pain. Now my pain is currently 0/10 and I know what to do to prevent flare ups. I am forever grateful for Leo's compassion and for his excellent first class care. I was always given one on one attention and will recommend Biosport to everyone I come across who has an injury or Sciatica issues.<//Text>< resp>

<Response>{'time': 1558379692355, 'text': "Happy to hear you've recovered and are pain free. Thank you for your review!"}</Response><Review>I just settled in Modesto about four months ago. After a short while, I injured my lower back during workout. I got “Spondylolisthesis”, the fancy word for slippage of vertebra, between L5 and S1. The pain was due to an acute mechanical cause; thus, very intense. ER and primary physician visits unfortunately did not add any value and were totally unnecessary in my case. While I was waiting for my MRI results, that finally confirmed the slippage, I visited BioSport, for physical therapy, where I met most compassionate and professional staff and therapists; from front-desk to Dr. Alex, to my experience. I received an adjustment after which I just felt so relieved and was sent home with hope and a bunch of relevant exercises. And today, I am back to my normal life without any pain. Indeed, proud of sharing my wonderful experience here!!</Review><time>1557713979170</time>< Name>

I injured my Right Shoulder getting ready for track and field. Because of the injury to my AC joint, I was unable to perform basic functions like taking notes in class. I couldn't get dressed without pain or perform chores at home either. Dr. Alex Stavrianoudakis worked with me for several weeks, and now I'm pain free and I am able to do everything I was able to do before my injury. The staff here is extremely knowledgeable and incredibly friendly. I'm grateful for everything Alex and his staff have done for me! Thank You!!!<//review>

I could feel the love of their work as they lovingly worked with me and respected me for who I was.  I would recommend them to anyone!!!!  Their friendly atmosphere and staff allows a person to be most comfortable!!!  Of course, we patients are there to "hurt" a little, but it is for our good and to be respected allowed the pain of healing to not hurt so bad!!!

My therapist has a great bedside manner, courteous and cares about helping me. Corey explains things about the treatment. She offers personal testiments of her own past injuries and struggles with pain during recovery. For me, It really gave me the courage and trust needed to push through pain and fear. I am truly grateful to have such an amazing and caring person working on me. Thank you. Namaste.

<text>This physical therapy office gives you a solution to your pain, and the doctors help you find the true cause of your pain. At other places I've gone to before they would just put ice on me and do some exercises and then I would be done. I barely even saw the therapist at the other places. When I came to Biosport, my life changed completely!! I had not been able to raise my arm high in almost 5 years, and after 4 weeks of therapy at Biosport, I was able to do it without pain!!! I had also gone to chiropractors and I always had pain after my visit. Here, my pain was taken away. All of the Biosport staff is also very friendly and welcoming! THANK YOU, DR ALEX and DR LEO FOR helping me get better!!< /text>< name>

BioSport is a competent, safe and professional facility.  The entire staff provides superb, friendly customer service. Monica always has a smile on her face and makes the reception area shine with her positive personality.  Alex and Sean are all about making sure their patient’s needs are met, in a thorough, diligent and professional manner.  The level of dedication, and investment in each patient is conveyed at every visit.  And that is what makes BioSport a unique place to attend.
I was referred by my mother and father whom are loyal patients here.  Additionally, I can confidently say that they met my 80 year old grandma’s expectations as well (as she too has been a patient there) and had nothing but positive feedback to share with me.  Finally, my husband just started his PT Tx there about a week ago and has nothing but positive feedback thus far as well!
I highly recommend BioSport and look forward to returning soon to strengthen and continue my path towards a full recovery!

Thank you BioSport Team! All of your collaborative work efforts shine through the results and goals you help each patient achieve.

I don't normally leave reviews, but I feel it is important to share how great BioSport is. Other reviews are true when they say the staff became their friends instead of just their therapists. I honestly look forward to my sessions, and I always know I'm going to have a good laugh while I'm there. I am very active in my healing process, and everyone, especially Alex and Leo, are very helpful in teaching me how to maintain my progress. See, I was born with weak ankles, that coupled with poor shoes, have led to falling arches and tendon dysfunction. This in return causes pain when I run or exercise. This pain hinders my career goals. However, thanks to the knowledge, patience, kindness, and friendship of the entire BioSport team, I have a FAR better understanding of my situation and how I can work to counteract the damage done in my foot and ankle. I've been working with the BioSport team for over six weeks now, and I still have another six to go. Within my first six weeks, BioSport got my ankles to normal strength! My calves and ankles have never felt so strong. There is still more progress to be done, but I trust that the BioSport team will have no problem getting me to where I need to be. They're innovative, knowledgeable, and they really do apply the "one on one approach."

If you are looking for a place that will make you comfortable and provide great treatment, then BioSport is the place for you!

My journey to healing has only just begun, but because of the incredible help BioSport has given me, I know healing is in my future. BioSport hasn't just taught me about my healing process, but they have resorted my hope that my career goals are possible. I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Alex, Leo, and the entire staff, thank you. Thank you for taking your time to get to know me, for answering all of my questions, and working with me individually. Alex, you are hilarious and awesome for going on runs with me in your fancy clothes. Leo, you are also hilarious and you are extremely helpful in explaining everything to me. And to everyone else, I have enjoyed every minute I have spent in your facility! I truly am going to miss you all when my treatment is over.<//text>

<Review>Their food and workers are great. Very sweet and down to earth. This is my go to place when we have family over. We get a lot for the price and the family loves the food. We are here almost every week to every other week.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Bad customer service, bought chicken and it was super dry.. called to let them know and the man flat out said oh well... i went back with the food so he can see how dry it was and luckily the owner was there to exchange my chicken with fresh chicken.  The tall man and the lady there didn't want to do anything for me but the owner told them to give me fresh chicken.  Still not going back  anymore since the tall man and the lady are the ones that are there on a daily and they have a bad attitude and no sense of customer service..< /Review>

<review>Horrible customer service! So much so that I am sure they don’t even know the meaning of the word. They left off an item. I don’t live close so it’s no quick trip. He hung up the phone on me! Don’t go to this one, there is a Juan’s Rotisserie in Monterey Park...same food and much better customer service. Not the same. Update: I just had the worst meal. Apparently, only the chicken recipe is the same. The sides do not taste the same. Again, worst meal! Ugh<//review>< pictures>

Fresh and hot, like a home,  great service. Thanks, was mi experience long time ago.
I love Chicken is my favorite...but, when I be there in Juan Pollo, no one costumer in the front, a lot chicken available the people talking out side the restaurant,  and I ask about service...Supose the owner told me...If you wait 15 minutes I can help you...really bad...Sorry for my opinion about that restaurant....< /text>

After I ordered the guy asked me: "you want white people tortilla or the mexican kind"? I said flour tortilla. He came across rude and disrespectful. The guy was chopping the chicken after he was handing money at register. Then he would wipe his hands on shirt. At the same time having a conversation with ex rehab member talking about personal rehab experiences. I just turned around and left. Worst place ever, dont recommend this place. They really need to improve the hygene and customer service.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very delicious roast chicken and the sauce.
Little serious staff but nice. And the restaurant is clean. We always see the cleanliness and the cleaning letter of a restaurant my husband and I, when we see a letter B we do not return almost anywhere, the letter C we run from the place without seeing entered.
But this restaurant is quite clean and has letter "A" perfect for eating.

(Original)
Muy rico pollo asado y la salsa.
Poco serio el personal pero nice. Y esta limpio  el restaurante.  Siempre vemos la limpieza y la letra de limpieza de un restaurante mi esposo y yo, cuando vemos una letra B no regresamos casi a cualquier lugar , la letra C  corremos  del lugar sin  a ver entrado.
Pero este restaurante esta bastante limpio y tiene letra "A" perfecto, para comer.<//review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) It is a chicken with very good flavor, the environment could improve safely, sometimes they smoke outside and the smoke reaches the inside. !!!!

<Review>The manager doesn’t believe their customers.

After I talked to the teller Mustafa he said the manager will be here to help you in seconds. After I waited for her she failed to waive a cashier check fees of $10.00 only even though I have told her I don’t do cashier checks often and usually they waive the fees, her response was: what is the name of the branch that waived it for you before, and the name of the representative!
I told her: Why do you need these information? You already have it in my account!
She said “to call her and tell her she is not supposed to do that?

Excuse me!

I am closing all my accounts very soon because of your attitude. Worst Wells Fargo branch ever!< /Review>< userid>

This place is by far the worst bank I have ever been in. I went in on Monday December 7 at 10 AM spoke with the receptionist sandy and made my appointment for Tuesday December 8 At 4 PM since they had no other available slot due to covid they are appointment only. I called to confirm my appointment with no answer,
mind you I left work one hour early and lost an hour pay for this appointment to open a new debit card. I thought since I have a car loan with Wells Fargo a debit account would be beneficial.
If I could rate this place zero stars I would! never go to this branch the receptionist was so inconsiderate and unprofessional.. They made a mistake on my appointment then continued to tell me that I never made the appointment as if I was lying very unprofessional I would not advise this location.</review>

First of all, WellsFargo need to hire more tellers, because they are always short and the process will take way too long. Also, they need to teach their security how to respect. Overall, I will rate this bank ZERO not even one start.<//Review>

Bad customer service! I went to the bank today 12/16/2020. I entered the bank there was no employee to register my name. When my turn came, the teller told me I must register my name with the manager outside and when I entered the is nobady outside to register my name. I waited more than 15 minutes, and then the manager told me "my bad" I don't see you I have to write you name and you have to wait to help all the customes then the teller help you.</Review>

Hours change frequently, the place is often closed with no warning or explanation, and the few staff care more about chatting amongst each other than tending to the growing lines at the counters. This branch is a complete joke.< /Text>

Spent an hour waiting for a banker to help my son sign up for a new checking account.  Signed in, and was asked multiple times what the name was, and what were we there for.  We kept being told we were next, and it never happened.  Finally left in disgust after the bankers that were there disappeared for over 20 minutes.  Thank you to Chase bank for getting us in with someone in 5 minutes and out with a new account in less than 30 minutes.  Customer service is a wonderful thing.  Maybe one day Wells Fargo will learn that.< /Text>

<Text>What a joke of a "bank" the only thing you can bank on here is high fees for everything.. and they hassle you to death check double check verify, call your references, take your blood, finger prints, run a background check and your credit and then you have to mortgage your children just to make a deposit in cash! This is everytime with valid ids ...three or four of them   are a must and this is for long time customers who come in every week!  WOW! Oh and they DO NOT want U.S. CURRENCY! !!</Text>< rate>

The most incompetent workers I've ever dealt with! As well as horrible customer service! Wouldn't let me cash my paycheck because it was under my married name-so I changed it and then they wouldn't let me cash my other paycheck from my second job because it was under my maiden name!< /review>

<review>This location gets busy but I happened to get there during a slow period. There was an ordering line into business  due to social distancing. Line was somewhat quick, I waited approx.10 min being third in line. 5 minutes after ordering I recieved my order at outside window when my number was called.
I would say I had ideal service/experience/visit on this occasion.<//review>< Pictures>

I showed up at 1030am and the food was hot and freshly cooked. However, I ordered spicy and got original, I got burnt fries, and the biscuits tasted like something I'd buy from the store in the discount bin.

I do not normally eat at churches and this will reinforce that original choice.<//Text>

It was horrible. Five people working, had big attitudes, orders coming out wrong, 30mins wait time, 1/2 gallon jug drinks warm instead of cold but they don't want to a customer a complimentary cup of ice. Never again...</Review>

I went inside for a pickup and it was the foulest most disgusting fast food restaurant I've been in! I smelled no chicken cooking. All i smelled was dirty grease. The chicken was piled a good foot and a half of chicken stacked on top of itself which has to way of keeping everything warm. It was a lazy display in that kitchen. I wouldn't feed my dog the food they sell out of that place. It's that nasty<//Text>

I order the mixed 9 piece but the breast were so small, I couldn’t tell them apart from the chicken wings from the top. I ordered an apple pie and did not get it. I noticed once I got home, but did not want to drive back. Their mash potatoe still taste fake, but I love their okra and their biscuits. That’s the only reason I go.

You have to make a line outside the building since only two parties at a time are allowed inside. It’s pretty small venue so it makes sense. Masks are enforced. Lots of parking. I wish they had a drive thru, though. The service was good, and timely although it was busy.< /text>

The chicken was good and it has been a long time since I've had their honey biscuits and they still taste as I remember. You can always tell when it's a good place to eat at cause there is a line which means people like it and it's popular</Text>

I had ordered through Uber eats. My order had been sitting in the store for a while. My first driver cancelled on me. They chose someone else to pick up my order. I reached out to the driver and requested for him to tell the church’s workers to get me fresh food because who wants soggy cold chicken, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and jalapeño poppers. These unprofessional workers really said IT WAS NOT THEIR PROBLEM THAT SOMEONE COULDNT PICK UP MY FOOD ON TIME AND THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME FRESH FOOD. That is just ridiculous and shocking. Even my sprites Ice was melted and tasted watered down. This is Bull****. Y’all should just got to Popeyes if I were you.<//text>

<Review>They have the absolutely best biscuits EVER!!!  Seriously they are soft, buttery and delicious.  I'm an ovo-vegan so I can't really say how the actual chicken tasted.  The sides were fairly decent although the amount was a little skimpy<//Review><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>116629323982229708375<//UserId.>< rating>

First of all if I had the option to give it zero stars, I Would !!! I love Church's Chicken & I’ve never been to a place where they treat you with such disrespect. They took 30 min to make 5 chicken sandwich meal, the lady at the register was very rude; on top of that they forgot my fries, I didn’t realize until I made it home ! I’m so upset; they made my church’s chicken experience a very very bad one !!! I Will NEVER Return To This Place Again !< /text>

This is the best Church's in San Diego, CA. The chicken is fried in new grease every day, which makes them above the rest of the Church's in the San Diego metropolitan area. Service is slow but you get what you pay for.<//Text>

What I don't understand is why every Church's have bad customer service in San Diego! I like the food but the people that works there are so rude and have really bad attitude! If they don't like where they work at, then they should find another job. Don't take it out on the customers.

I think this location customer service is worst then the rest of the locations in San Diego. If I wasn't so hungry I would of walked out. HORRIBLE,  UNFRIENDLY AND VERY RUDE EMPLOYEES! NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN!

CASHIER MARIBEL, CLEARLY YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE FIND ANOTHER JOB!<//Text>

<Review>Man. It's a small Churches Chicken. I was kinda stunned at first compared to what I'm used to. There isn't a drive thru, wait near the door if you wanna stay cool (it's very hot in there), and they have coupons online y'all that are better than their in store deals. They can scan them and you save more. Just general word of advice. If you have time, always ask for your food fresh. I appreciate the employee that told me their biscuits weren't too fresh when I was there. I waited for some fresh ones and me and my husband loved me more for doing that. Thank you for reading this!💯</Review><Response>None<//Response>< rating>

<review>The customer service is the worst, the person that's in charge of taking the order is really rude and everything they do they do it with a negative attitude. I don't recomend it because of the rude and disrespectful service the employees give.<//review>< Date>

Most of the times we have been there, there has been a few ppl ahead of us, but not many! It's funny though because, when we usually leave, their line is out the door! Unfortunately, their service is mediocre at best! We know that most of their customers take their food to go, but there is no extra employee to help tend to the dining area or the restrooms! Their work area is extremely small and they have a tendency to walk on top of each other if you will! Overall, great food whether its mild or spicy its yumminess here!< /text>

The food was okay as usual, but what made this drop to one star (should be zero) is the service. Never have I seen a cashier be so unprofessional (vivian). Instead of helping around the kitchen while I was deciding what to order. No, she was on her personal phone texting, I came up ready to order, and she did not attend to me. She kept her attention to her phone, and to make it a better score. I said what I want yet, she responded "uh huh..." When I put my hand down on the counter she then became attentive to me. She spoke in a low pitch that I had her repeat a few times. The "cooks" had many burn scars up and down their arms. I've seen other places providing their employees with longer gloves around deep frying oil. So sad to see crappy service in a small popular place.< /text>

Terrible I came here for spicy chicken meal which they are known for and can you believe they were out. Then there are like ten people in line for the same thing. Unfortunately because of time I had to order the original but you can believe I won't be back to this location. Eating area is mess. I think they have a great staff I just think it is lack of leadership from Joana the manager</review>

Went here for lunch and ordered the spicy 3 piece meal, took off and when opened my box there were only two pieces and not the spicy either (and i paid for the 3 peice too). I saw two guys working the one on the register had decent service but the one handing out the food seemed like he was on his period or something... smh plus i didn't get napkins or forks/spoons. Church's in Oceanside is way better in every way.</Text>

<text>Food is good, but only if you want it to go.  The place is very small and uncomfortable to dine in.  The restrooms are not that clean and has some vandalism in it.  Overall, I just buy food here for to go.</text>< pictures>

WAY better than the one closest to 32nd st.  Chicken tastes better, always hot and they have more specials and coupons than any near 32nd st.  If the line is long, wait.  The line moves ok.  Worth the wait.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) They take a long time to give orders and there are also no bathrooms for customers, they could give better service but laziness wins out to keep the bathrooms clean due to the pandemic

<Review>(Translated by Google) Highly recommended, the chicken is very rich, the staff is very friendly and they speak Spanish, they have a lot of parking and they also take care of you quickly, when I went it was very clean and quiet, the only bad thing is that it is not very visible, that's why I knew it existed, I highly recommend it

(Original)
Muy recomendable, el pollo está muy rico, el personal es muy amable y hablan español, tienen mucho estacionamiento y además te atienden rápido, cuando fui estaba muy limpio y tranquilo,  lo único malo es que no esta muy a la vista, por eso no sabia que existía, lo recomiendo mucho<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>
