<text>Food is always delicious, ingredients very fresh, and service is friendly and fast. I loved dining here pre-pandemic and the quality of their food has stayed excellent as take out, which hasn’t been true everywhere. The menu is plentiful and delicious, I especially love the smoked eggplant, crab fried rice, amok trei and various veg dishes. Highly recommended!!!<//text></record>

We got their omelette stuffed with beans and shrimp, the green bean special, and I personally had their banana leaf-cooked catfish.

The first two were very solid. My main dish was absolutely incredible. The flavor in the fish was so strong, and went so well with the Angkor beer. The price for everything was a bit high, but the flavor definitely backed that up.

This is definitely one of my new favorites!< /review>< response>

The cooking is fresh and tasty. The flavors are on the mild side and excellent. The lime flavored light broth was delicious with a lime flavor that brought out the delicateness of the lime rather than its potential overpowering flavor. The service was informal and friendly exhibiting a rightful pride in the authentic Cambodian cooking. Certainly a restaurant to go to.</Review>

Flavor was wonderful and they are able to make it mild if you request it. I also enjoyed the rice. It sounds silly to even mention rice  but there's was great, cooked all the way through and fluffy.

If you have room for dessert try the fried banana and ice cream. It definitely tastes homemade.< /text></record>

A cozy, ethnic restaurant with delicious Cambodian food and superb dessert.

While you might just casually pass up this inconspicuous restaurant while walking along Broadway, you'd be playing yourself. The inside is cozy and inviting with all the Southeast Asian decor and friendly service.

The menu offers a variety of lunch and dinner specials, from salads to grilled items to curries. We got a rice crepe with chopped chicken to start and had a seafood medley curry and beef shish kabob with brown rice. Everything was savory, cooked perfectly, and delicious. The rice crepe, stuffed with bean sprouts and topped with a garlic vinegar sauce was surprisingly fresh and was a great way to start off the meal. The shish kabob was juicy and flavorful, and the curry was out of this world. The fish was buttery and tender, and curry matched perfectly with a side of rice.

The dessert here is so good, they have permanent dessert menus fixed under the glass of each table. We got the fried banana with house coconut ice cream, as well as the fresh manila mango with sticky rice. Both were satisfying without being overly sweet and a perfect way to end the meal.

I would highly recommend trying this place out!< /Text>

Pretty good food!  This was my first trip here, and the food was really good.  Fast and friendly service, very willing to help us out with menu recommendations. This is the first time I've had Cambodian, so I can't compare it to much else, but it was very delicious!< /review>

The waiters were very friendly and helpful, but the dishes were a bit expensive for how small they were, in my opinion. They were delicious, and I really liked the amok knor which was not overwhelmingly sweet and had a unique, creamy texture. The atmosphere of the restaurant was clean and cozy.<//Text>

This is a small restaurant in china town Oakland. Service was very friendly and food did not take long to be served. We ordered combo 1 and sautéed chicken. They accommodated my allergies to gluten and were friendly when we brought our little one in a stroller taking one table and did not care.  Food was tasty. We came after 5:30 pm and it was easy to find parking. Otherwise there are parking places in the area.< /Review>

Stayed for dinner here with my two teenagers.  All chose a plate from the solid menu.  Everyone was very happy with their choices.  Really recommend a stop here.  There is some standard Thai food on the menu, one dares to try something outside their comfort zone so you will probably be pleasantly surprised.  Reasonable prices and nice service too!<//Text>

Battambang was recommended by our foodie cousins and they weren't wrong. The food is familiar on one hand and slightly unusual on the other. Two of us shared the following: the Num Banchou which is a rice flour crepe stuffed with chicken, prawn, onion and sprouts: the Battambang noodles which is akin to Pad Thai (sorry for mixing cuisines) but satisfyingly rich with a tamarind sauce. But the most unexpected and wonderful dish was the Kdarm Salk Bam porng - soft shell crab in a sweet coconut sauce. Exquisite! I can't wait to initiate others to the wonderful world of Cambodian cuisine and look forward to working my way through the menu.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Battambastic!!! This place was incredible. I wasn't sure what Cambodian food was like, but now I'm spoiled.

Upon many other E-recommendations I had the Grilled Lamb Chops with the side of sautéed veggies. The lamb was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.

The Battambang Noodles are similar to Pad Thai, which had a bit more flavor if you askes me. Very similar though with orangey noodles, peanuts, sprouts, and we went with chicken.

The little Lawt fried pork egg rolls went quick. So, you may need 2 orders.

We also shared some shrimp fried rice which was quickly devoured by my family of pirranahs.

Sodas come in their natural can, so you can count on what you're getting and for only $1.50.

All the way around Battambang was an absolute hit, and super welcoming staff too.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I'm not a regular, but I have yet to be disappointed with anything I've ever ordered here. The drink selection could be bigger. They accommodated our last reservation for 20 quite well and at a great price, though naturally it became difficult to coordinate appetizers and entrées. A solid choice in a neighborhood that has few.<//Review><gmapID>0x808f80b6fbe64651:0xb3494c54f0db3e31<//gmapID>< user_id>

Super helpful and friendly staff/owner! Didn't know the name of the dish that I wanted, but they were happy to help me figure it out!

The battambang noodles are stellar, and a great unique taste of Cambodian food.</text>

<text>I've been here a couple of times and they both were amazing experiences.  I wasn't too familiar with Khmer food but to me, it was very familiar--a mix of Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese foods together.  We ordered extra food on top of our initial order because it was sooooo good! Don't miss out!</text><user>108600814425299954434< /user>< resp>

Went here on a weeknight and had a great meal. Very close to many downtown locations, including the convention center. The hosts were polite, funny, and incredibly informative about the (very) long menu. Many of the dishes have fish sauce in it, so if that smell upsets you may want to reconsider. The menu does have a few vegan options without fish sauce as well.

I recommend any of the appetizers with anchovy sauce, which was delicious. The catfish special was cooked perfectly and went along great with rice. One of the highlights of the meal was the young coconut drink which was incredibly fresh and had lots of tender coconut meat inside to share with the table.</Text>

Nice little restaurant. I would go back and try other dishes. I had #13 and thought it was a little bland.
Great service and friendly.
Ambiance is a little dated.</text>

This is the best restaurant in Chinatown. So good. Food is not too oily, and it’s very unique. Service is great and the owners are so nice! Took my parents there when they were visiting and they wanted to go again the next night for dinner! It’s seriously THAT good!< /review>

<Text>This is a popular place for Cambodian food because they do it so well. The menu is extensive and if you're not sure of what to order, the servers are very helpful. My favorite is the smoked eggplant which is barbecued in the morning to get that smoky flavor infused, then it is later cooked with vegetables and your choice of meat or tofu. The soups are one of the best ways to get your meal started--hearty and delicious! For dessert, we tried the banana-leaf wrapped jackfruit custard--yum!!</Text>< rating>

Based on one visit, I would definitely eat here again. The baked tofu with veggies in tamarind sauce (#92 I think) was very tasty, and ready very quickly. The service was friendly. The prices are good. Be aware they have a $15 minimum on credit card charges.<//Review>

If there was a 6-star rating, Battambang would get it. My husband and I go to Cambodia every year, and have never had such tasty and imaginative dishes as we get at Battambang. Try the appetizer platter and the fried bananas with coconut ice cream!<//Text>

Authentic and delicious Cambodian food, absent any of the "unusualness" of wierd spice or "Monkey Brains," which most folks might feel might be too much. Worth a trip from the City, short stroll from BART Civic Center.<//text>

We come here for lunch.  It's a hit or miss because there are time they're not open.  For the most part, we've been lucky most times we go there for lunch.  I really like the BBQ pork plate for lunch.  The pickled veggies help cut the fattiness of the pork.</text>

Went in for dinner and had 4 star food with 3 star service. I’m only giving them 2 stars because their table menu is priced 20%-40% more than their online menu. It feels dishonest and I’d like to see them update the online menu prices.</Text>

Delicious, very friendly staff and EXCELLENT VEGAN OPTIONS.  Their menu is huge and has one of the best vegetarian sections I've ever seen.  Also, free refills on coffee! (but ask them to make it strong).
The portions aren't huge but they're satisfying and reasonably priced, plus they bring you a big pot of rice.
Not to mention it's a short walk from BART and close to the waterfront.
Will return, for sure.< /Review>

I'm glad Potrero Hill has this cute little small French bistro so that we can grab a nice dinner nearby our place without having to go very far. It's really small, so come early or be patient for a table.</text>

<review>Love this restaurant and will definitely be coming back for more. They have great food and great service. The ladies there are super nice and make great recommendations. We had the papaya salad with shrimp, which was ok, but the trout and crab fried rice were delicious! For dessert, we had the warm jackfruit custard in banana leaves topped with coconut and that was awesome. I scooped up every last bite.  Prices here are also reasonable. Best Cambodian restaurant I've tried thus far.</review>< resp>

<rating>5< /rating><text>This place was the best! They were so patient with my gf and me. She's a vegetarian allergic to mushrooms and peanuts and I'm a vegan, so most restaurants get frusturated with us. Our waiter was incredibly helpful and steered us to the stuff that worked for both of us. The food was also INCREDIBLE. We ate until we were stuffed it was so good. It's a cute little restaurant in Oakland with a nice view of the building the Smart and Final is in.< /text></record>

We brought a customer here many years ago, and they served a cockroach at the bottom of the coke.  They offered nothing but a free refill as compensation.  Will never return.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Delicious curry. Would have liked something spicier and a little warmer.

First time I went here it was awesome, 2nd time was horrible, got it home and found all fat and skin in what was suppose to be a pound of meat didn't even have enough meat for two tacos. I noticed when I was waiting for my order the girl behind the counter was making two orders mine and another gentleman's, I'm white and the other guy in Hispanic I saw here pack his and it looked great. Can't help but feel like she did it on purpose to me because I'm white. If it was like 50/ 50 on the meat I would let it slide and not think another thing about it , but it looked like she took all the stuff that nobody would want to eat and shoved it in a pack for me.<//Review>

Very good carnitas. Only problem is they take a long time. I had a to go order for 11 and I didn't receive the food to almost 11:30. Another problem was in order for them to sell me some tortillas I had to buy 2 lbs of meat, I also wanted to pay for another dozen but they couldn't even do that. They even sell you the onions, cilantro, and lemon. Usually other places they give them to you.</Text>

<review>The lady serving the food had a runny nose that completely disgusted me. The lady with her had attitude, the food was good though, but they also took too long. I also ordered carnitas to go and asked for onion and cilantro and some lemon to go and they charged me $2 WHO THE HE'LL CHARGES FOR THAT??!! they also charge $2 for debit</review></record>

<text>When we lived in Orange County, we would drive to Santa Ana to go to El Pollo Ranchero. We finally found a place that is just as good.  Tortillas a mano and everything on the menu are first rate and an anticipated treat. The menudo is really good too, but make sure you emphasize "SIN PATA" if you prefer it without.  They tend to forget.  They only take cash so come prepared for a great meal.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) The only good thing is the carnitas, the very high prices, for what we spent there we would have eaten at Lazy dog.

Except when you chop them up like mincemeat 3 times they have been ordered whole and they don't mind they do it. And I do not see it convenient for those who pay with Atm that the machine is behind it and not in view of the client. It does not give confidence .....

Las carnitas buenas. Excepto cuando te las tan picadas como picadillo 3 ocaciones las eh pedido enteras y no les importa lo hacen. Y no veo conveniente para los que pagamos con Atm que la maquina la tengan atras y no ala vista del cliente. No da confianza.....< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I've just been in the store and the male sales associate wasn't helpful at all which I told him. 2 clients including myself and i had to call his attention. I've been a loyal customer and all my work shoes are NB.
I guess it's time to watch out this guy's work behavior. He was just talking to a coworker I suppose who's playing ball inside the store.

< Review>
Great place to get shoes and insoles to support your feet. My wife just had a diagnose of neuroma condition. The doctor recommended to come to this store for an insole and a shoe.

This store has very highly tech equipment that would help you to measure the exact fitting of your feet. My wife got a 3D view of her feet on a platform and was fitted with a right sole to correct her feet condition.

With the computer rendering of fitting, the sales person was able to bring a few recommendations for shoes to go along with the insoles. After wearing those shoes, my wife felt the pain in her feet went away. Those high tech gadgets worked wonders.

They do have a lot of shoes and athletic apparels here for the New Balance brand. And I believe running shoes are very good as I was walking around browsing the displays while my wife was fitting her shoes.

The store allows only a couple of people in the store at a time and placed many covid safety measures. They do clean the machines between customers for fitting.

The parking lot is huge. It can probably accommodate over 50 cars. Thanks<//Review>

I made a call to the New Balance store and asked them initial questions. They said that they have a short supply what I was looking for. When our party went to there, they ushered in the store. We purchased a pair of toddler's shoes. I used own a shoe store as well so I know shoes. New Balance is a really good brand; the pair I have purchased was well made. My kid loves his new shoes. I've got a good remark from the kid's mother as well.<//text>

Very clearly NOT busy either.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1etbUQ-vSA-deSGKqCbS1s8bxaty96It5NmXm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

I had a great experience with a very knowledgeable guy with a very fashionable style. He mesure my feet 👣 to help me find the prefect insoles and the prefect shoes. I was very pleased with my shopping experience. Thank you 😊</Review>

< Review>
I had the pleasure of visiting this location yesterday. I was greeted and helped by Chad. He knew pretty much everything about all the different kinds of shoes and soles that New Balance offered at the store. The customer service was unbelievable! Chad was awesome because he didn’t pressure my friend or I into buying anything and he spent a lot of time with us answering all different types of questions regarding New Balance products that we were inquiring about. These are the type of star employees that made my experience excellent! When in doubt, ask for Chad and he’ll set you up for whatever you’re looking for! Thank you Chad!< /Review>

I didn't know how much my shoes had contributed to my feet hurting until I slipped on a pair of New Balance shoes. Instantaneous I felt an incredible difference. My feet felt so good that I felt like dancing.</text>

< Review>
I got a coupon at the LA Marathon expo in early March, that expired in April.  Then the shutdown hit.  So, basically you only had a week to use the coupon. I went into the store last week, and they still honored the coupon!! They are practicing social distancing!  You wait outside until they let you in.  When I went in, there were maybe 6 people in the store. Very helpful service, and they have a good selection of colors and styles.

They are closed from 2-3 everyday, for cleaning!<//Review>

5 stars to Chad! So far in my experience with the the store associates in  New Balance Pasadena, I trusted Chad than anyone else there because he is good in listening to the customer and he is good in finding the right product to certain customer. The store itself offers good services but it just depends on how their staff commit to that duty.< /text>

I bought their product from Amazon, it came like this, I tried to reach out the customer service, I spoke with Janae J. but they told me they will not refund me or anything that can help me with that, So I just wanted to share this with whoever wants to buy from them, it's up to your luck to get the right or wrong one and there's no any customer service after that!< /review>

This is a really great place to find the right custom shoes for your feet. They have a super nice measuring machine that can tell you where you put the most pressure when you step. They also have a large variety of shoes to choose from! I ended up finding the perfect shoes for me. They also have many shoes for people who have wider feet.< /text>

I've never given five stars. I have also never been to a shoe store as cleen and knowledgeable to the comfort of people's feet. I wish I'd known about this super technology a while ago. Shot out to my husband who did the research so as again I wasn't disappointed. Chad and Adam were so attentive to my needs, and found the perfect fit for my ever demanding feet. I have the worst, in my opinion, flatest feet ever. None the least I was comfortable in knowing that mine weren't the first they have seen. Adam thanks for not letting me feel alone. You guys are super fantastic and you should know how the life changing work you do is appreciated! Cant wait for my new and a long tome waited custom arch supports. New Balance you complete me!< /Review>

Awesome service. Came in 40 minutes before closing and stayed til a bit past closing time but at no point did they make me feel like I was wasting their time nor did they try to rush me. Kenny helped me find the right shoe and fit. He was also very knowledgeable regarding different foot types and the proper shoe for me. Excellent customer service.< /review>

A nice store, but very pricey.  Employees were courteous and helpful.  Shoes are expensive, but high quality.  Watch out for the insoles.  They can cost more than a regular pair of shoes.<//text>

<Text>Walked in, was greeted. Then was left to browse the merchandise. When I had already been examining some shoes, someone walked over right when I needed them and asked to assist me. He measured my foot, brought out different sizes just in case,  answered all my questions and wasn't  pushy about it. Quick ring up, browsed the clearance section with the guys help, alas what I wanted was not in my size. Said thanks and continued my day.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I got the best, most accurate fitting in my life. Reasonable prices for New Balance. They even had my WW width in stock. Ben, the fitter/salesperson was courteous and able to answer all my questions.< /Text>< Time>

I needed new shoes for walking and this store was recommended to me by our neighbor. They were great -- personal attention to ensure a fit and I am very happy with the result. I am going back to purchase another pair.<//Text>

<Text>To tell you the truth shoes here are good but not the best - or at least among the best. The place is not something special as well. However service is. I was glad to find how patient, polite and considerate people here are. There is a story behind my headnote but as it is personal for a someone, I would not retell it.<//Text><Response>None< /Response><user_id>118326765405199086191<//user_id></record>

<text>Great shoe store. I have really wide feet and have been having some foot problems for years now. Miguel got me on their machine to measure my foot and got me shoes an insoles that have made my feet feel better than they have in 5 years or more. I was so impressed and happy that I convinced my parents to come out from the Coachella Valley to get shoes and be helped by Miguel. The shoes aren't cheap like Payless, but they are SO much better that if you can swing it, you REALLY should.< /text></record>

They can assess your foot size and arch using a machine, so your shoes will be more personalized for you! Staff was very professional & friendly ! I will defnitely be going back! Buying shoes from here is money well spent !</Review>

<text>Came in to buy baseball cleats for my son. They did not have a huge selection in his (smaller) size, but the sales employee was very helpful and offered to order any color we wanted in that size and they could have it in a couple of days. I also had my son fitted for a semi-custom insole for the shoe. They have a broad selection of insoles designed for various problem feet, low arches, high instep, etc., and machinery and software that maps the contours of your foot<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I am in mid process with Dr. Basta but it is, in my case, prolonged because she suggested orthodonture and I’m glad she did. She is extremely knowledgeable, confident and explains procedures well along with good communication while you are in the dentists chair. That is important to me, I don’t like dentists not explaining what they’re doing and why. I like that she communicates with my orthodontist well and is willing to team team up with other professionals for optimal care. I would not hesitate to recommend her, and her staff is really good too. I feel that they are doing all they can to help me with a tricky implant/bridge situation. Total pros. 👍</review>

Dr. Basta is an amazing dentist and prosthodontist she spent a lot of time explaining to me everything that needed to be done and took into consideration everything wrong with my mouth and jaw and took the time to make sure I understood everything she really does care about her patients which is number one on my list. She is very knowledgeable and not worried about spending time with you to make sure you understand the procedure. She spent almost two hours with me and we paid only $50 for an initial consultation I went to another prosthodontist and paid $150 and he would barely even answer questions I had left very upset at that place but at this place doctor Basta's office. She had taken the time to make sure I completely understood very very professional very kind and caring person I would recommend this place to anybody needing serious Dental help.< /Text>

I am amazed at the level of care Dr. Basta and her team provide. This office team are one of the best,  from Alicia,  office manager to the rest of the staff( my apologies for not getting names). Not only is the team hospitable and accommodating,  but they have the latest and greatest technology around.  Dr.'s passion for her craft says it all.. I can't wait for the next step.. thanks you all for your graciousness and expertise!!< /Review>

<Review>This was my worst dental experience ever and I will never go back and would certainly never refer any of my family or friends. It was my first visit and my last and I was referred by a dental professional that I hold in a very high regard so I thought this would be a good fit. I was left waiting for over 5 hours and never treated. They also tried to charge me fees that my insurance company said were not billable. Additionally, they planned to charge me $35.00 per visit for PPE even though the insurance company said that fee is not billable and Dr. Basta's office didn't seek an approval to bill me for that fee. Stay away from this place because they are unethical!!!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c32843a966e585:0x1f1f0e03630c1200< /gmap_id>< Resp>

I can not say enough about the women in this office. Dr. Basta is an amazing woman. He talents far exceed her expertise in the chair. Her love for her craft, dedication and perfectionism are so very appreciated. More importantly, though, she really truly cares for her patients and it is evident in all she does. Her heart is huge!! Thank you Dr. Basta, again for changing my life and helping me with my new journey!! You are a blessing from God!! I can't stop smiling!!</text>

Dr. Basta cares about her patients and her work as much as any dentist, née health care professional, I’ve ever known.  She is a craftsperson and an artist, and seeks perfection and takes great pride in her work.  I consider myself to be fortunate to be a patient of hers.<//Review>

At my last dental appointment, I was impressed by the increased measures that Dr. Basta has implemented to provide a safe environment for her staff and patients.   In these uncertain times, I am thankful and appreciate her continued care and consideration to keep us safe and healthy.    The staff are also friendly and helpful in providing a pleasant experience.</review>

<review>The staff at St. Mary Dental-Saeda Basta,DDS,MS was nice and helpful. The procedures were timely and handled with care. The equipment they use is very nice and new (seeing my teeth xrays on a monitor built into the char was pretty sweet). The Dr., personally was very friendly and upbeat, all in all, it was a really great experience. I highly recommend their dental services to anyone in Covina, CA!< /review>< pics>

When visiting Dr. Basta, I am always thankful for the care and detail she takes in her work. She explains in detail what she is doing and always takes the time to make sure I understand and I am comfortable with the treatment options she is recommending. Also, I appreciate how kind her staff is, especially Alicia at the front desk. Thank you Dr. Basta 🙂<//Text>

I can’t say enough about Dr. Basta and her staff! They are the best!! No where else will you find a specialist who is in it for the sheer joy of it! She cares about her patients and goes way over and above to do whatever she can to help. After many, many years of paying for bad dentistry and then many years of dodging going at all, which just made my teeth worse, she was my answer to prayer! She helped me overcome my fears by fixing all the problems... one at a time!!! And now I sleep better at nights! I can’t thank  you enough, Dr. Basta, for putting up with extreme cases like me!!!< /review>

< Review>
My new smile is great! I feel very confident about my new smile and the confidence goes even deeper. I feel beautiful inside and out! Every time I walk past a mirror I smile ear to ear! The compliments I receive are too many to count. It makes you feel very good inside when an outsider recognized your teeth! Great cosmetic dental service! Thanks again!</Review>

Dr. Basta is very detailed and cares a lot for her patients. She did a lot of work on my mom, the result is my mom’s denture stays in place. She is so happy with it and she is able to enjoy all her favorite food. We are thankful for Dr. Basta.</Text>

It has always been a pleasant visit to my favorite dentist, Dr Saeda Basta. And after almost 4 years since my last visit, I still feel the same confidence in her knowledge, skill and professionalism.  i walked out there with the guaranteed best smile.  And the staff?  Alicia and Roxanne you're the best!!

How I found her?  Honestly, in August 2010, I prayed for the best affordable dentist for a dental implant before I searched the internet.and how else could my prayer be answered?  The first name that showed up was "St. Mary's". That was all it took.  And the rest was an experienced care from a compassionate and professional environment.  Thank you Dr Basta, Alicia, and Roxanne. God bless you!</text>

Well, this is your 13 dollar sandwich. Don't waste your money. Bread bigger than the filling. I wish I had gotten the refund while I was waiting 15 minutes as the only customer in line.</text>

Wonderful selection of well crafted sandwiches for any taste.  Plenty of parking and indoor and outdoor seating.  Reasonable prices as well.  This place is way better than Togo's or Subway!< /Text>

If you are familiar with Ike's you know what to expect, and this store does not disappoint! Killer sandwiches with a great staff and friendly service... Good vegetarian choices too. I recommend the Matt Cain, Paul Reubens and Menage a Trois! 👍< /review>

I frequent this superb restaurant often  as I love the ambiance that is outline this restaurant. The team is extremely attentive and qualified. The service is certainly efficient. Most important, the food you eat is outstanding. I came more than once and I was always happy. The pay is modest. I highly suggest this restaurant to to all.<//text>

Food was great! Customer service was great!  Only issue is, it's small + busy, so not comfortable while waiting for food. I recommend maybe an outside speaker so people can hear when order is ready while outside.<//Review>

Rude staff so decided to order online and they didn’t add everything I ordered and had no hospitality. It’s a shame because I understand having a “bad night” in the industry but multiple times has made me never want to go the this location even though I love the vegetarian sandwiches.<//Text>

Love this place. Huge variety and really good dirty sauce. I recommend Dutch bread, hot mamma, ghost cheese and extra jalapeños.< /text>

It's impossible to not find a sandwich that will knock your socks off. Everything imaginable and then some. No way can I even scratch the surface of explaining the possibilities of what you can do with a sandwich. Ike is a genius. You must check out website before you go to avoid selection overload. Something like 500+ ways to go. About 50 most popular are listed on the on site menu. Now go enjoy. Your mouth and stomach will thank you profusely.< /text>

Great sandwich shop!

I'm a big fan of the sandwiches offered here. If you serve dutch crunch, I'll be there in a heartbeat. There are lots of interesting types of sandwich here and the menu seems to be slightly different every time. Regardless of the insides, always go for the dutch crunch. Extra crispy with a hint of sweetness. What's there not to love! The voodoo chips are pretty great too. I'm a fan of the spicy variety.

I think it's awesome that they give a lollipop with every meal. That's a sweet touch! Cheers.<//review>

The sandwiches are really good.  I can, whole heartedly, recommend the Limerick (a San Ramon Exclusive) as the Honey Habanero is delicious.  Just the right amount of heat and just the right amount of sweet.  The only negative is that the lobby is a tad small and can get pretty crowded during lunch.< /Review>

<time>1500765631161< /time><rate>1</rate><text>Well if you are going to have a businesse and taking orders is required. It is probably a good idea to get the customers order correct. I ordered lettuce and mustard only.  Yet it still came with the dirty sauce. Did I do something wrong? I don't think so but I do know that I'm still hungry.

Worse part is that I ordered to go and had to bring it back. More of my time gone on a Saturday. Told cashier what was wrong she said no problem let me get my manager.

Manager comes over starts to process the refund. Then stop puts on gloves open the sandwich looks at it. Then ask me oh you didnt want the dirty sauce? I'm fine with asking me about the order and all. I'm more disturbed by the manager looking at the sandwich. If I don't like it, would in really come back 30+ minutes later.  Was given a refund. I've been to other locations so I thought I knew how to order my sandwich. Might give a second chance after some of the "Sorry we are all new employees" wears off. But I have been known not to give a second chance, I might just have to put this location on the "Do not eat list".< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Many many many choices of sandwiches to choose from very good quality meats and breads come hungry and it a good  choice to phone your order in before attempting to just show up moderately priced but I'd like to think it because it's due to the higher quality meats used you won't be disappointed make sure you check out their drink selection too< /Text>< pictures>

I've been to three different locations and every one is great. The quality does not change from location to location. Service is quick staff is typically always nice and i have yet to have an order be wrong in the last 5 years.< /Review>

<Text>So this location wants to disregard what a government website is stating for anyone who's driver's license has just expired and need renewal My brother had to renewed his driver's license and as of today it's only 29 days expired The government website in California states any driver's license that has expired is extended for 6 months meaning that it's not expired for 6 months The enterprise locations in San Diego California are not aware of it Pacific Coast highway location is now aware of it and they do follow by the government stated rules on their website so they will honor receipts and extensions for 6 months on your driver's license The employees here at this location is rude they never have vehicles ready for you and they try to push you away instead of finding a way to get you in your reservation and out the door. I have already contacted the corporate and let them know so now the district manager will be notified of this complaint and hopefully they go by the government stated website because if a police officer can go by the Dmv's government stated website why can't enterprise? For enterprise locations to disregard that the DMV states they don't want anyone in their location who's not needed to be because of Corona virus.
Enterprise still will tell you to go to the DMV disregarding what the Dmv government has applied. Managers supervisors district managers and any higher department please educate your employees on what stated on the government websites. Your enterprise website says you want to continue to keep your members safe so one way of keeping us safe is applying the rules< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<user_id>101270526862351551844</user_id><Text>I reserved a car in October for our Christmas holiday visit to San Diego.  We were staying at the hotel circle area, so this location was perfect.  Because of reserving early, the rate was excellent!  I requested an SUV.  We arrived on time for that scheduled pick-up, and our Ford Edge was waiting.  It had great room for 4 adults and all of their luggage.  The back-up camera had a large screen, and the car was very manageable.  The Enterprise employees were welcoming and lovely, and made the whole experience as pleasant as possible.</Text>< Pics>

I rented a car for a few days and it was as smooth sailing in every way. The car was clean and ready for me when I got there. It ran perfectly and looked good for a good price ($125 for 3 days 2 nights). When I returned it just before they closed it was no problem and a new guy working there gave me and my brother a ride back to our hotel down which was on the other side of the expressway. Couldn't have been better<//review>

We rent a car almost weekly for work from this location and they are by far the best. Even when I rent for personal use, I come here, even though there are 2-3 locations closer to home. These guys are awesome at Hotel Circle.< /Review>

I was worried about the fact that I had used a toll road and found I couldn't pay as I usually do (app on my phone--I know, I should have asked ahead of time).  Come to find out Enterprise takes care of it, no hassle. I got a great weekend rate as well.  Will definitely use these folks again.< /Text>< user_id>

< Review>
Rented a car from them a couple of months ago. Was a little out of the ordinary process, as it was rented by my son in law and charged to his credit card.with me as an added driver. The location manager for the Hotel Circle North office was friendly and accommodating. When I returned the car car on a Friday afternoon, he let me extend the rental beyond a week for $10/day over the weekend. Put the extra 3 days on my credit card. Great guy with good sense and empowerment. Easy/ breezy transaction.  What a great guy!< /Review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>Once again, ERAC does its best to disappoint its customers.    First, the agent ran my Discover card and he said it was declined.  I immediately called Discover and they said it was a chip reader error and told the  agent to slipe it instead.  The agent refused, stating he couldn't swipe it once it was declined (lie #2) and demanded another card.  All I had was my debit card.  He assured me that it would be a hold and not a full charge (lie # 2).  In fact, a full charge was issued to my debit card.

I contacted the manager when I saw the charge and she couldn't understand why I was upset.  She stated that a credit was issued (still no credit showing )

I am not sure why I would think I would receive good customer service from Enterprise, but I continue to rent from you.  Well, this is the straw that breaks the camel's back.  There are too many other choices in rentals in the San Diego market and I will be using them moving forward.< /Review><gmapID>0x80d9552cc4c0c6e1:0xdee7c6574531011d<//gmapID><rating>1</rating><Time>1559056188010<//Time></record></dataset><record>

I have used Enterprise (Hotel Circle San Diego) exclusively since my initial excellent experience with this company and this location. Not only did they provide the best prices for my needs but also the best customer service - they treat me like family. I would highly recommend Enterprise as a company and a service especially the hotel circle location if you're in San Diego as your go to car rental service.< /review>

My experience with Enterprise was excellent. They went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with the rental car.  There were problems with the car I rented so they asked me what they could do?  They wanted to be sure I was satisfied and they were willing to work with me.  When I told them what I wanted to make me happy they had no problem in accommodating.  Meaning they were quick to respond without hesitating,  I would rent thru them again.<//Review>

<Review>Words can describe the world class top notch service I reciceved a few weekends back by Jake at the Enterprise Hotel Cir N location...

People were comming in drove well after the hour of closing and Jake calmly and professionally took care each and everyone of us... like we were the only ones in the building.

I wanted to take the time to give kudos to Jake for a wonderful, fast and seamless transition from one car to another... please let him know how much I appreciated is service and I will send anyone I know that needs a car to come see him personally!

Way to Go Jake!!! Excellent Job!

I have rented cars from Enterprise for months using my credit card for authorizations and paying the balance when I returned the car with a debit card to keep my credit card clear with a zero balance.
I have just encountered a complete breakdown during my latest rentals over the last 2 weeks whereby Enterprise has not issued proper credit to my credit card after accepting and receiving money from my debit card. I am unable to use my credit card because the charges from Enterprise have not been released in a proper or reasonable timeline even though they have been paid.
All of my prior experiences with renting from them released the charges within 4 days but i currently have a need for authorizations dating back 12 days and another dating back 2 days. Enterprise maybe using pigeons to fly their authorizations to their cardholders accounting offices for clearance to save money.....so beware of their accounting if you chose to rent from them.< /text>

I am writing about my poor experience with enterprise. For all the tourists that use there credit card for the deposit and then want to pay cash at the end when dropping of car I would never recommend going to enterprise. All other car rental companies allow you to pay cash when returning vehicle. Reason I'm not happy is because they said they don't accept cash. I already did my exchanges when I was in Canada and wanted to use my American money but was forced to pay with credit card and now I am getting charged twice for the exchange rate. Over all bad experience.</review>

Good experience with the car, but they tried to scam me. I declined optional services after the usual explanation and signed some stuff (who reads it all really). When i asked why the total was higher they said it was a deposit. Ended up being a bunch of optional services they tacked on. Thankfully right before leaving, I complained and they removed the bogus charges. Lesson learned to be extra careful when signing docs.< /text>

I declined  DW PAI SLP and RAP and sign the contract when I pick up the car. However, when I return the car, they charged all these fee. The price is more than two times. I just called the guy and they agree to refund my money back. Finally, I got my money back. The car and the service are very good.</text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Horrible customer service.  I rented a 2017 Ford Fusion for a work trip.  It stopped working properly about 5 hours after I rented it.  Enterprise wanted us to pay for the tow.  They towed the car , didnt bring us another one, and I had to use my personal car to make the trip.  The Mission Valley office was clueless about what happened to the car and actually had no idea where it was towed to.   They lost the car for two days after it was towed and we had to call the tow company and relay to them that it was towed to Poway Ford.  The guy at Enterprise Mission Valley kept intimating that if the car REALLY WASN'T BROKEN (and we were just idiots) that we would have bills to pay!!!  Then the manager called me and apologized and promised no bill and one free day.  Today 1 week after I thought the incident was behind me I got a bill for $80.25 on my card.  Enterprise Customer Service was of no help stating that only the local office could resolve this.  Of course, it was 12:01pm on Saturday and they close at 12.  They did not answer their phone.  My husband and I have spent so much time and effort on what should have been a simple thing.  I was going to give Enterprise another chance on a rental next week.  Not now.  Canceling.  OBTW, never got the free day coupon in the mail.< /review>< pics>

I didn't spend too much time looking around, but have deduced that the establishments business model overall as a whole is successful since the lot itself was only 1/3 filled to its capacity.<//review>

Didn't have the option available that I reserved so they gave a generous upgrade from mid size sedan to a full size SUV.<//Review>

<Name>Jason Turner<//Name><Resp>None<//Resp><Review>I have been a member of the club and a board member for some time now and I am happy to have LRC as my home range. The range uses common sense range rules including the use of chamber flags during cease fire which increase the level of awareness and overall safety. The membership is strong and includes a well performing junior program. At a time when many local Sacramento ranges have closed, the Lincoln Rifle Club has managed to keep the doors to the range open for over one hundred years in its present location. The club includes a variety of matches for pistol, rifle, and shotgun and for the price it is hard to beat. There is a little bit for everyone, including beginning shooters.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

So upsetting! The staff is SO RUDE, COLD, UNWELCOMING. NO hello, NO good morning, just READ THE RULES. My wife and I are clean well dressed polite and respectful people. We were shocked at the attitude. After he said "READ THE RULES" we left. Never even made it into the place. Everyone says the same thing in the reviews. These people simply don't know how to treat others that enter the range. Don't plan on having a day of fun here. They will ruin your day.< /text>

Rule#1 for any new person shooting there, DONT walk up to check in with weapons in hand.  Walk up get the range safety attention then he will issue you a lane, safety flags, and tagets if needed.  Bring cash.  Other than that great run range, nice long cease fires to check targets and setup new ones!< /review>

It's a good place, the range master was on the spot for safety but wasn't overzealous and treated gun owners with respect and adults. It's an outdoor range and if you're going for distance it's a good range, if you're doing pistol like me, I'd rather go to an indoor range but that doesn't mean I wouldn't go back. Price was cheap but bring cash! They had loaner breach flags which was nice. I'd recommend it and might go again.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I have sighted in my hunting rifle several times at this range. You are able to shoot out to 200 yards and they have a metal gong at 300 yards. The range is clean and ran professionally. The staff can be rude when you don't follow safety protocol. I feel a little safer knowing someone is watching the careless individuals at the range. Overall, the range is a great place to shoot.<//text>< pics>

After reading mixed reviews I wasn't sure what to expect but I had a excellent experience for my first time. The safety officers were very kind and professional and they let me use their sled and scope to zero my rifle and even helped me out. The range was clean and orderly. The  $15 fee is worth it. I will definitely be going there again.<//Text>

<Text>I suppose they got all their friends together to write positive reviews. Myself and a number of people I know who shoot absolutely refuse to go to this range. I have had the worse most humiliating incidents shooting there. The only thing I can figure is that if you are one of the local "good ole boys" then they may treat you with a little respect. I have been going to various ranges for over 50 years and have never experienced the down right rudeness and anti-social behavior that I have from their "staff" Its really something you have to experience yourself to believe. And now they raised the rates to $18.00 ?  Sure, pay to be treated like trash !!!

<text>Great little shooting range. They have 3 sections, one for pistols, one for shotguns, and one for rifles. The pistol range goes from 10 yards to 50 yards. The shotgun range is trap only I believe but don't quote me on that. The rifle range is 25 yards to 200 yards. They a few communal steel targets out at around 200 and 300 yards. $15 if you're not a member, $10 if you're a vet (I think it's $10 anyways), and free if you're a member.

Would definitely recommend checking this place out. If you do go, please be respectful and curtious since it's an awesome range and we'd like to keep it that way.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Weve been living in Lincoln for several years now. I always thought, this was strictly a members only range. It is not, its open to the public, and if your military or a veteran, they give you a discount. I found the range perfect for my needs, and being only 5 minutes from my house, opposed to an hour, was a plus.
The staff I met today was more than helpful, and courteous. I spoke with a few people at the range, all where very nice. If your looking for a good range,  without having to drive far, this is it.
I would definitely recommend this range for pistol and rifle shooting. The rifle range is a couple hundred yards, more than enough range to ethically take a shot at anything in ca, or just plinking.< /text>< Pics>

This is a range for folks that are serious about sighting in their weapons and testing reloaded ammo. It is a well managed and well run shooting range.< /Text>

Been a member now for 3 years,  I won't shoot anywhere else, best, safest,  cleanest place around,  for those who think 200 yards is not enough,  it would be dangerous to let just any gun tooting yahoo let loose rounds out into the unknown! you should have to qualify, as for the staff, best I have had the pleasure of meeting as they make the range safe, they have to be firm, lives are at stake.< /review>

The range is self is clean but only reaches out to 200 yards. However the staff is extremely rude. The regulations are outrageous. They only allow one shot per second which makes any sort of handgun training impossible. You are not allowed to draw from a holster either. There website claims active duty military shoots for free however this was not the case. I provided my military ID (im active Army) and staff member still tried to charge me. When i mentioned that their website said all active military shoot for free. I was told that it didn't matter if i was active military i was still required to pay the range free. I chose to leave due to the disrespect and rudeness of the staff.<//Text>

<Gmap_id>0x809b3d00862e0679:0x935d641ffb3d1d76<//Gmap_id><Text>Staff is incredibly rude.  Regulations and rules are very extreme and far beyond standard safety protocol.  You're not allowed to shoot more than one shot every three seconds making practice at normals rates of fire impossible. As a CCW carrier, they still would not allow drawing from holster.

Cons
- Unprofessional/Unknowledgable staff
- TERRIBLE HOURS (closes at 2pm most days)
- Expensive for open range and paper targets
- Cash Only
- Phone never answered
- Website not up to date
- Claims free shooting for active military but this is not true.

Pros
- So safe that you'll hardly fire your firearms
- Never going back

This club has been around a log time and has some pretty great history. It's a shame to watch a range I've gone to since childhood with my father turn to the worst.</Text>< pictures>

<Date>1405154439342<//Date><rating>5< /rating><Text>I've been a member here for a couple of years. Everyone here is very friendly and helpful. One range safety officer comes off as a bit of a drill sergeant, but he's actually a great guy if you take the time to get to know him. Likewise with the other range officers, and I always have a great time chatting with the other shooters during cease-fire too. Some will even let you shoot their weapons if you ask nicely.

Hands-down best value for the money of any range within an hour's drive of Sacramento. Only $10/head with no time limit - and if you join the Lincoln Rifle Club they allow you unlimited use of the facility for an entire year for only $60. Other local ranges charge $17/head or more, with only a small discount for members. There is no onsite retail store, but who needs that? Just go to Wal Mart for your supplies or to a specialty gun store before your shooting session.

Targets are clearly marked, and rules are strict but few. As long as you have your chamber flag in during cease fire (and then stay away from the bench while range is cold), don't rapid fire and don't draw from a holster, the staff won't bother you.

This place beats Spenceville hands-down. It's safe and controlled by comparison, has comfortable places to sit during both "range hot" and "range cold," and doesn't have garbage lying all over. It also beats several other area ranges on price, attitude, and range rules.

DO NOT argue with the range officers. They will kick you out if you're deemed a safety risk.< /Text>< Pictures>

This range is where I go cause it's close and safe, and I can sight in my rifles without having to worry about ignorant new shooters not practicing safe gun etiquette, staff is old school but respectful . It's simple act right with respect/proper gun etiquette or shoot at spencer ville with the asian rats under your feet collecting your brass</Text>

We love Canine Connection and so do our dogs!! We always feel secure leaving our dogs there. Whether it for the day or for a week, we know they will be taken care of and loved almost as much as they would have been at home.<//Review>

<review>I’ve had dogs for over 60 years, the Canine Connection is the best, most Professional and most loving Dog resource I have ever experienced. Training with Dr. Sarah Richardson and her staff is a joy. My Camp Fire dog Shadow was made to feel comfortable And safe so she could learn new things (she had a troubled history). My English Shepherd puppy, Charley was brought out of his shell into the amazing “teenager” he is today during his Pup 1 class. Sarah hires the best, dog loving and knowledgeable staff ... my dogs love them❤️.  I also want to shout out to Sarah whom I worked with during the Camp Fire, caring for the lost dogs (including my future Shadow and her Rudy). She was tireless ❤️❤️❤️< /review><gmap_id>0x8082d8ae5b46938b:0xf0c1fb77262f6bfa<//gmap_id>< user_id>

<text>Our high energy doodle loves Canine Connection! He goes to doggie daycare there twice a week, is groomed there once a month, and stays there overnight anytime we travel. The staff members are always friendly and the facility is top notch. They are great about communicating and you can tell they really love all of the dogs.</text>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I like everything about this place! My dog and I have attended training classes here, he goes to daycare on a regular basis, and now we have started using their groomer as well. The people are always kind, amazing with my dog, and COVID compliant. They even text me pictures of my pup during the day and answer quickly when I check in on him.

I started training classes online via Zoom at the beginning of the pandemic and they were fantastic, then we transitioned to in person classes. There were 4 or 5 of us in each group and everyone remained masked and distanced.

Most recently we have started using their groomer, oh my gosh, she is incredible. I brought her details of how I wanted my pup to look and a picture for reference and not only did she do a great job with the groom, but I could tell he was not as stressed as after other groom appointments elsewhere. My dog is pretty sensitive and she made the time to go slow and ease him into the process to keep him comfortable. Usually after a groom his stomach is upset from the stress and he smells bad from having gas, after this groom he was perfectly happy and fully himself. I commend groomer Sarah on her work and look forward to our next groom.

As for Dr. Sarah, if you don't already know,  she is wonderful. She has given me all kinds of advice on dealing with various behaviors and training techniques.

I love Canine Connection for all things DOG and if you are in the market for daycare, training, grooming, or boarding (I don't have personally experience with this but if I had to live my pup somewhere other than with close friends I would definitely pick here) definitely check them out and see if they are the right fit for you.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<date>1593057904059<//date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>The Canine Connection in Chico, CA is an amazing dog training, daycare, and boarding center that uses positive reinforcement training methods. Since COVID, Sarah and her team have been able to help support new dog and puppy owners through online classes, and now they are able to offer classes, daycare, and boarding at their state of the art facility. They are
implementing safety protocols to keep everyone safe while they have fun learning with their puppies and dogs too.</Review><response>None<//response>< UserId.>

Sarah and her team are top notch. Sarah is highly educated, friendly, professional, and great with the dogs in her care. I don’t trust everyone with my two crazy dogs - but I certainly trust Sarah. Canine Connections is a great facility that is welcoming, clean, and well-thought-out. If you need training, daycare, or boarding, I highly recommend Canine Connections.< /text>

If you are a dog lover and owner you really need to check out The Canine Connection. Sarah’s training is research based and effective, the facilities are state of the art and the staff are all knowledgeable, friendly and supportive. Our energetic Aussiedoodle is at her happiest after time spent here. An exceptional resource for our canine companions!<//review>

My dog loves it here. She sprints to the door and puts her front paws up on the door until she's let in. We never have to worry when our dog is boarded here. She's treated like royalty! The staff and facility are wonderful and they are only place in town where there is always someone on staff 24/7. They also provide training as well.<//text>

With our pet being a part of our family, this has been very comforting to us.

My girlfriend and I came here for a behavioral consultation for our 18 month old dog. He'd been having some compulsive behaviors that we couldn't solve on our own. The facilities were wonderful and the staff were every bit accommodating. We feel quite hopeful in walking out that we have some direction to go and that Riley can overcome his problems. I can't recommend Canine Connections enough.< /review>

They accommodated us with a -day-before-meet-and-greet with our black lab. The personnel are great and friendly. Ownership is pleasant but a bit odd. They have the most extensive set of forms I've ever signed, basically disclaiming responsibility and moving it to the customer. They want to remove your dog's collar and ID because it is evidently common for them for dogs to fight enough to oftentimes remove the collar — I find this strange and worrisome, so I asked that my dog not be in an aggressive play group, which they accommodated. They worked out perfectly for me, and I appreciate their work; however, I don't like the philosophy under which they run.< /Text><user_name>J Clifton Meek</user_name>< resp>

Great place to hang out. Also, they have different stores and food options. When parking 1-2 hrs is free. Also, don't forget to validate your coin.
Always an experience. Love the ambiance. Truly a touch of class. Try to shop and enjoy yourself when in town.< /text>

<review>The Color Loft is awesome! A wealth of services when I need pampering. . Walker has been cutting my hair for over 16 years. Even during a brief move to NM, I'd plan visits back specifically for hair cuts and treatments. Not only is he spectacular with traditional cuts for both men and women, but he stays up to date on trendy state of the art techniques for coloring and styling. He is nothing short of AMAZING! The salon is clean, fun and friendly. Everyone is talented and genuine! She listens to what I wanted and was very skillful. The shop was even beautiful, and the service was just what one that I would expect. Eventually, every time I visited here, I always felt happy and blessed. When you want the best, go to The Color Loft! A refreshing experience!<//review>< Pictures>

This Salon is super classy, trendy and state of the art. In love with the Hair Stylist Misty Irene, her work is like nothing I've ever experienced...from her cool, funny and loving personality to the best coloring techniques on the planet, she has the blonde colors dialed in! and not to mention the best shampoo/massage I've ever experienced! <3<//review>

<Text>I have never done a review but... I had an appt. this morning with Liz at 8. I had to rearrange my schedule to be at this appt. She walks out at 5 mins after looking like she is exhausted. Doesn't look over at me although she was told I was waiting. Another dresser tells her I might have another client for you and she comes alive and preceeds to look at pictures on the person's phone without even acknowledging me. The receptionist tells her I'm waiting and another person asks me who I'm waiting for and I point to Liz who is still ignoring me. She can see me because I'm right there. She crosses in front of me and tells the receptionist to give the women her card. She then turns to me and asks if I'm ready. I nod yes and go to her chair. She leaves to get something then comes back asking what I'm wanting done today. No good morning or apology. I tell her I think I'm leaving and she immediately says OK in a rude tone. While I grab my stuff, she loudly says, "you know I do have other clients" Wow. On top of ignoring me, she now belittles me. I tell her that I don't mind her talking to other clients (during my time) but she could have said hello to me and told me she'd be right with me. But she just ignored me and then had the nerve to defend it. I tell her when you did ask me if I'm ready, you didn't even say good morning or how are you. She waves her arm pointing to the door. Wow again. An apology would have done wonders. I just leave. So sad how customer service is lost. I can honestly say that I have never been treated this way ever. This was going to be my second time with her and I had friends and family to refer to her but not any more. No one should be ignored or treated this way. Another hair dresser told her client good morning, I'll be right with you. So I wasn't asking for too much.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

What an amazing new location!! I have been going to Walker for almost 20 years. He’s cutting edge! Great stylist and a master at color! My hair would be a hot mess if not for him! Haha... His new location features many new services:  Massage Therapy, Microblading, Facials and more! I can’t wait to try these!! Yay!  My first visit to the new salon was today. Elegant yet fun and fresh. Love all the wood combinations.  Everyone is SO friendly and welcoming.  Can’t wait for the Grand Opening! Congratulations Walker and Team!!</text>

<review>I was visiting Great America and decided on a whim to stop here for a beer and quick dinner. The atmosphere was quaint. Lots of local people. I was obviously and outsider but didn't feel like it. I chit chatted with a couple of people while karaoke was happening. The guy that places the piano and the lady that served us were the owners. I even got a goodbye as I got up to leave with my daughter.< /review>< Pics>

Welcome back to the 1950s! Amazing place, unchanged by time, with original decor and good food with friendly service. Note that there are two doors, one to the cocktail bar which was loud and dominated by a TV and equally loud barman surrounded by people who looked as if they lived there, and another for the restaurant which was completely empty when I was there but set for full dinner service.</review>

They treat you like a long lost friend! I knew local's names and everyone that worked there by the end of the afternoon. Loved the live music, even got up and sang a song with the two-person band. Enjoyed the food and drinks as well. Very welcoming. Will return!</Review>

Vahl's was told to expect 30-40 people at our lunch and about 100 showed up. They didn't miss a beat and did a fine job. Service was great and the food was perfect. They handled it like they were prepared for it.< /Text>

<Text>Frank is a great bartender. Introduces himself, asks my name and did not forget! This place is a throwback to a earlier time. Music played live in the bar. Clientele is older and the atmosphere is casual.  Great place to relax! Feels like the sitcom " Cheers". Enjoyed a couple while watching the Giants game.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Really nice place with a comfortable vibe that makes you feel right at home. Frank the bartender was friendly and quick to pour a drink, and the other patrons were mostly regulars, some of whom have been coming here for decades. There are also several big LCDs playing the games. My wife and I had a great time and look forward to visiting again soon.< /Review>

<review>The meal was fine, but the ambiance was a bit sad. This is a place stuck in the past for better or worse. You get a strong impression from the decor of what this place once was, but little care has been put into keeping this former gem polished or relevant.< /review><Rating>3</Rating><user>107053148879042151121< /user></record></dataset><record>

<date>1468651191841</date><rating>1<//rating><Text>I have heard about this restaurant since I was a teenager. Well I finally had the opportunity to try it. The menu was limited I think they had four choices so I ordered the chicken cordon bleu. When it was brought out I was surprised to see it had mushroom gravy on it. I've never heard of it with gravy on it. It was horrible. The gravy seemed from a can as did the mushrooms. It wasn't cooked thoroughly and it looked like the frozen version I had bought before. The reason I think it's frozen is because my bf ordered the same thing and it they were identical. If it were fresh they wouldn't be the same because it's hand made and nothing handmade has a twin. Well in top of that the price was $18.50. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you just want to drink then the bar isn't a bad choice.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>There was a party of 18, we came because it was a Saturday Night, and we thought we could enjoy the ambiance, (which is fun and funcky)  expected entertainment, as it was advertised.  They decided NOT TO HAVE ANY, as they also had anothrer huge party (that took over).  Trouble could have been avoided if more staff had been there to help, AND if the doors to the big group had been closed.  It was way too noisy to carry on any kind of conversation.   Food was served nearly 90 minutes after ordering.  It was ok, but not like if we were special.   Sorry Vahl's, most of us will not be back.<//text>< Pics>

Its a dieing restaurant. Vahl died a couple years back at about 99years old.
The restaurant doesn't have tge draw it jad back in the day. The prives are rather high.
I pain $19.00 for a 5 course meal of liver and onions. One of my favorites and it was delicious.
They also have Prime Rib, Lobster, and various pasta and I believe chicken dishes.
They also have dessert but I was full.
They also have a bar and you can be seated in the bar to eat if you like but I wanted to sit in the dinning room all by myself. So I did.</Text>

They may be good during lunch, but their service is slow and their menu limited at dinner time. Our food took an hour to arrive, and there was only one waitress to serve the whole restaurant.<//text>

<review>Carl's Jr.'s menu holds very limited appeal to me. For food that is supposedly fast, I never seem to be able to get out of Carl's Jr. with my order in hand in any less than 15 minutes. Their lackluster burgers seemingly take just as long as Five Guys' or In-n-Out's to prepare, yet are significantly inferior in every way. The fries are a lame impression of McDonald's. Aside from the limited run of the "Babyback Rib Burger," I can't think of anything I've ever ordered for lunch or dinner at CJ's that I haven't immediately regretted. The aforementioned rib burger was like an upgraded McRib with crunchy onion straws but alas no longer available.

The breakfast menu at CJ's is somewhat better. I don't hate the "Sausage Egg and Cheese Biscuit." In fact, their biscuit may be the very best biscuit in fast food currently. The egg is a bit weird, like very thinly rendered egg that has the girth and lightness of a folded napkin. Also, like a lot of fast food "yellow egg product," the flavor is more aggressively "eggy" than you'd expect -- and certainly moreso than if you scrambled an egg at home. My solution? Order without the egg. You won't miss it.

This is a co-branded Green Burrito/Carl's Jr. restaurant. There exists approximately 300 of these co-branded Green Burrito/Carl's Jr. stores, almost exclusively in the western and southwestern United States. Despite being located in the middle of University City, this particular location's drive-thru intercom system is ghetto, ensuring you need to repeat your order fourteen times on average before the order-taker understands you. Other than that, I'd consider this to be an "average" Green Burrito/Carl's Jr. location.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOR7V3tAGC52QsOuVuom1w2ywkyP8Hn3L0EC9Ck=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSL8HLbRg2VqusRxn-enTDezfBUIfaaMI-8usH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

I tried In-N-Out the day before, it was basically a salad that accidentally had a piece of meat on top 😂 Carl's jr. Burgers are much better for my taste and pricing!  Also didn't take an hour and a half to get my order completed. Took maybe three minutes.

All in all, great fast food restaurant.<//Text>< response>

One of my favorite Carl's out here. Fully renovated and stylish, with modern appeals. Employees help with a smile, but you also have the option of Touch orders. Mobile orders, and delivery using Postmates!</text>

<Text>5 stars for customer service but 1 star for food  quality. I took my crew to enjoy a "good job" dinner and were greeted with a great smile and attitude. She was patient while we decided what to order. Our food came out in normal fashion. My fries were nice and fresh but I ordered a Western Bacon Cheeseburger and my onion rings were older than an old boot. The crew enjoyed their food and we were seen off with a smile accompanied with a gteat attitude.< /Text>< pictures>

One of the best fast food burgers out there.  Lettuce is always crisp and fresh. Char broiled burgers so there's no extra grease.</Text>

The staff is friendly and can get food quickly. A good place to get a late bite to eat in University City. The burgers they make are normally put together poorly though.<//Text>

<review>I started eating my French fries about thirty seconds out of the drive thru, and they were already cold. The Western Bacon burger however was excellent and still warm when I got home ten minutes later. My regular Coke must have been filled to the top with ice because it went unbelievably quick and left me unsatisfied.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Just know they don't give you enough sauce, I ask the general Manger for more  ranch and she said "only one is free" so I said okay. I'll buy it, she said "no I can only give one out." Watch out people don't be surprise they are robbing you from your meal. =[</text>

< review>
The chicken tenders were amazing. Who knew that they made such good ones. However my soda was way way off in terms of taste. Trying to save a few bucks and make more money off of your customer by watering down your soda is not a smooth move. The cheeseburgers we ordered were heavy and Hardy but the manager who was working drive-thru didn't listen very well to the order and made multiple mistakes that had to be corrected. Slow down and listen and give your customer a moment to look at the extensive and expansive menu. Service was fast in terms of food wait time, I probably would have ordered more had I had a second to read the menu</review>

Green Burrito has the best red sauce anywhere. You have to ask for it special since they got rid of the salsa bar, but it's worth asking for. It's great on a burger too. Ask for it.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><review>Worst service!!!  My mom's bag broke while carrying  food from inside Carl's Jr. out to her car parked in front of the exit door in their parking lot.  She requested a replacement fry that had fallen out of the broken bag. She was denied the fry because it happened outside. My mom is in her eighties.  She had made a sizeable purchase. The broken bag was hastily placed into a plastic bag.  The food was scattered everywhere.  I  am  very disappointed in  evening management.  Seniors should be treated with more respect!!!</review><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc00c1afaa60d9:0xbaf659f2ea803160< /Gmap_id></record>

Otherwise I'd probably skip them because while it's typical Carl's Jr food, they take forever. I'm not exaggerating that I spent 25 minutes stuck in drive through. When I got to the window, I was upset and I told the girl that I was stuck for 25 minutes. She said, "No, my clock only says six minutes, sir." When I pointed out that that the time from actually getting the order box, she just ignored me. Nevermind that even six minutes for a fast food joint it too long. The next time I went was about a week or two later and I created a video timing the whole experience. It was 15 minutes that time. So I contact the manager via letter and they said that they would work on it. That was over six months ago and ticket time still sucks.<//Text><rating>2< /rating></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I've been to this Carl's Jr./Green Burrito several (20+) times and have been pretty disappointed by the service.

They have gotten my order wrong around 50% of the times I've been there. Sometimes it's just a minor mistake like forgetting to include the sauce. Sometimes they will give me the wrong items or completely forget to include items.

On top of that, for some reason the food at this particular location does not taste as good as other Carl's Jr. locations I've been to.

One good thing about this location is that the staff is usually very friendly. However, they seem to be understaffed often, which makes the drive-thru service very slow.

At least they are open 24 hours/day, which is very convenient as most nearby restaurants are closed late at night.< /Review>

<Text>Why bother calling yourself open 24hr when your don't take order between 11:30pm til ~1:00am? Been here twice between those time and was told system is restart... FIRST Carl's Jr I've been too that gave me that excuse, first fast food restaurant ever!!

Thought I was just me the first time, but when I saw 3 cars just blast through the drive thru the second time. Well then, the owner better figure it out quick, because they're losing out on money that I coulda spent there<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< username>

<Review>Ordered online initially (through DoorDash)  never came so decided to go there myself. Asked for one ranch one honey mustard and they said they couldn't give us two different sauces. I am not joking, I ever asked if there was any other way to get that additional sauce, the answer was no. Moreover, careless employees, cold atmosphere etc...</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Also it was obvious the lady working the drive thru could care less about your experience or if you ever come back. If this was the type of place where you tip I would have left no tip.</Text>< Pictures>

Rude mgr and staff

Asked for the advertised deal on Windows and the mgr on duty said they couldn't honor it anymore despite it being up still, then asked for a Taco salad and they said it was closed even thought it's a 24 hr location. Then I placed a order and they acted like I was rude and it was my fault then waited 12 min with only 2 cars in front of me for my order. . I've emailed. They responded and said they would get in contact with me, reminded them a few days later. Still nothing. Now it's over a week. Noting.

I've been coming to this place virtually everyday for years and my experience with both staff and restaurant has been stellar.

Slow or busy  breakfast, lunch, dinner or sudden late night green burrito 10 car pile uo at the drive through, everything from the cooking to the conversation is genuine and cool.

There's a style that shines through this place that helps to blend in the residential area to its East to the business area adjacent the busy Genesee/Governor intersection  to its West. The well maintained grounds compliment the almost the parking lot nicley making perfect use of the available space. The property , by the way,  is always 100% clean with not a straw wrapper or oil stain anywhere, ever.</Text>

I disagree w/some of these review's! My kiddo & I just ate here after school & the service was absolutely AmAzInG!!! I am & was quite impressed... I ordered and ate inside the  establishment. It was clean, freshly stocked, & the food was FRESH & WARM! They even had fresh slices of lemons too! Just another plus to me, as most FAST-good resteraunts don't seem to have anymore!!! I give them a A+ all-around 5☆ to the one & only Carl's Jr/Green Burrito! -oh, and we ordered from both Carl's food menu & Green Burrito... which has Cholalua hot sauce ((this gringo probably spelt that wrong- lol)) just an added + for the original home of the famous star!</Text>

<rating>2</rating><text>Terrible costumer service...  The manager or assistant manager was the only one handling the order for the drive and the front counter.  What really threw me off is that one of the employee in the back saw that we have been standing at the register for awhile (5 minutes) while the manager is more concerned about the drive thru, so he decided to come and take our order. Before he started manager comes over and tell him to go to the back and finish sweeping the floor in front of us.  She even had the nerve tell us to hold on while see completes another drive thru order before she help us. OK!!!   So we got our number and sat down.  We wait and wait, 20 minutes goes by and I am watch the manager fill orders again and again for the drive thru.  I go to ask for why it was taking so long for the food and her respond was sorry but I have to take care of the drive thru first. So she gives me half of my order tells me other is coming.  So again here i am stll waiting and again I am watching her fill DRIVE-THRU orders.  I love CarlsJr. but I will never go to this location ever again.  The manager should be concern about the costumer insted of the floor if she short up front. SHE NEEDS A LESSON ON HOW A MANAGER SHOULD BE DRESSED AND MANAGE EMPLYEES.<//text>< Pics>

<review>So I went through the drive-thru and I got the number 16  usually  fish fillet I usually go for something  light but it seems like the  fish that I had. nobody had order for the past two days so they just put it back in the fryer ,and it tasted like the rotten dry fish it was horrible highly not recommend you to order the fish cuz nobody else's order it.</review><GmapID>0x80dc00c1afaa60d9:0xbaf659f2ea803160< /GmapID><Name>Cesar Carrillo<//Name><Rate>1</Rate></record>
