<Text>Getting a haircut with Liv H. at Floyd’s Studio City is such a blast! Liv is professional, courteous, and kind. She carefully listens to the customer’s needs, and delivers a world-class haircut every time. Not only that, but her personality is consistently upbeat and positive. If you are looking for a fun haircut experience, then I highly recommend Liv H. at Floyd’s Studio City!</Text>< pics>

<review>I have seen Liv the Barber for several haircuts at the Studio City location on Moorpark. (I just booked another one, in fact.) She absolutely NAILS IT. I am very picky and particular about my hair, and Liv simply crushes it out of the park every time. I work in entertainment and have to have a certain look, as in, it has to look the same each time I show up to shoot. And so I appreciate that she is so skilled and so consistent, and SOOOOO GOOD AT WHAT SHE DOES. Thank you, Liv the Barber! See you soon for a trim.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1618523441541, 'text': 'Thanks so much for coming in and leaving Olivia a great review, Ryan!

Giving Floyd’s 4 Stars because this was always my solid go to location for haircuts, but here to post a warning to future customers: unless you’re getting a buzzcut do not get your hair done by Mehgeady (spelling likely very off as I did not take her card). I also tried to look her up on their website but can’t seem to find her....

I should have known it’d be a bad sign when I happened to know the person in her chair ahead of me and when he walked over to say hi after the first thing he said was “Well that was awful.” Should have run for the hills following that but instead when she called my name I bit my tongue and sat in her chair anyway.

I like to do a simple clean up around the sides and then the occasional inch off the top every other haircut since I like the whole undercut on one side and the longer look on top.

I told her this exactly. But that’s not what I got.

She gave me the usual 4 around the sides, but only she didn’t stick to the sides. I should have ask her to stop the second she started just kind of blindly waving the razor all over, yet I held my breath and was punished as she then shaved up into about a third of the way into the top (longer part I only want an inch scissored off) of my head.

Now I’m considering having to find new locations. It’s really unfortunate since every other person I’ve had here has always been awesome (the reason for the 4 stars. Would be 5 if I didn’t now have a weird half buzz cut I’m going to have to wait to grow out again??)

She did horrify me when she asked if I wanted my eyebrows done and I immediately envisioned her shaving those off too.

The individual handling the phone desk pointed out how oddly fast my haircut was. I wish I would have said “It doesn’t take that long to murder something once so good.”<//Review>

<review>I love this place and everyone is great but today I had a bad experience with "jessica" or who ever was the manager on duty today (maybe she gave me a fake name)

I hope the real manager or whomever over looks "jessica", sees this review and takes note of her performance.

Today April 14, 2019 around 2:45pm. The allegedly manager "jessica" told me the wait time is about 30 minutes. So I went across the street and returned a little over 30 or 40 minutes. I walked back in and asked if it was my turn yet and with a very bad attitude and without any sympathy says to me "no sorry we erased you". I kindly asked if she can take me next since I was on the waiting list and already waited such a long time, she responds to me sarcastically saying "I can't just go around looking for you to see where you are" she repeated this to me like 3 times. I asked how long will the wait be and she replies "another 30 minutes". I kindly asked her again if she can give me credit for the 30 or 40 minutes i already waited and maybe take me sooner, she again with a very rude attitude and sarcasm replied "no". I asked for the manager to see if he/she will help me since I could not wait another 30 minutes and she replied "i am the manager", which dosen't make sense by the poor customer service she gave me.

She may or may have not been correct on how she was suppose to handle my request since I possibly might have been a little late by her estimated wait time. After all, it is an estimate and there is no policy explained, posted or visible on how the walk ins and wait time works. It would have not killed her to just give me credit for the time a waited already. She was totally rude, gave me attitude and sarcasm for no apparent reason. She showed no respect for my time nor for being a loyal customer. I hope they show her how to give better customer service.</review><name>Stanley Diaz<//name><GmapID>0x80c2be014544ae13:0x9dd89c8e920994c0< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Busy on the weekends?  Heck yes!  A hip joint and franchise that knows it and their main focus group I'd say would the be twenty somethings.  I didn't have a bad experience here.  Nor would I say it was stellar.I came to Floyd's shortly after moving into the neighbor hood after I cruised by it on my single speed.  I looked it up on Yelp and decided to take a chance on it.I didn't have a particular style in mind, but I knew I wanted to get a trim done as I was trying to grow out my hair.  I let the stylist have free reign and came out looking clean and with all my limbs in tact.  Suffice to say I will be back...In other news, I believe it's all about finding a place you deem affordable and finding a stylist that you like and develop a business relationship with.

Pros
* Straight razor finish
* Massage
* Atmosphere
* Beautiful people
* Cost/Value
* Accepts appointments
Cons* Busy

Very disappointed with the haircut I requested. I felt the barber didn't know what he/she was doing. Simply asked for a taper fade and received a bowl cut. Had my wife go back and fix it over again. To make matters worse I was charged 6 dollars extra for a simple beard shave with the same hair clipper that was used to edgemy neck. Not professional when you whisper to the cashier the add-on charge  of 6 dollars when I'm standing right there!!</review>

The woman behind the counter scowled at me as I entered. Waiting in the wait area I overheard her saying something racist, so I left.</review>

Called ahead to ask if I could make an appointment. Was told they take walk ins only all night. Maybe I misheard her or she misheard me?

Showed up was quoted 20-30 min. 40 min later I ask how much longer it will take, and am told that a bunch of appointments had been made and now There is still have 4 people ahead, because they have to honor the appointments.

No one bothered to give me an update once while I sat there, and the girl at the front desk gave a very empty apology.

Rather than continue to have my time wasted, I did not stay for the haircut. So this review is regarding my experience with the front desk only.<//Review>

The homies always hook it up, especially my G Diego he’s one of them. Make sure to always come here for the best futsul experience you can play. Just pick good players and turn into you favorite player on the pitch.< /text>

Ive been playing for 3 years here and they always mantain the fields in top shape. Renew the soccer balls and keep the timer boards working. There is also soccer program for kids of all ages managed by licensed coaches.</text>< Date>

<resp>None<//resp><Date>1501130784249< /Date><Review>Great Facility, nice fields and easy parking. However the  staff  have no concept of customer service and basic morals. As a group we have been playing here since it first opened when they were struggling to find teams to play on the fields. We grouped together and paid for an 8.30 time slot at our suggested rate which was agreed upon.  After a couple of months the office decided it was a prime slot and asked if we could move to 9.30. We agreed and gave up the 8.30 slot for 9.30pm. Not ideal but we are a flexible group. Cut a long story short the last two weeks they have cancelled our games and had the audacity to tell us another team wanted to play for an hour and half and has offered more money. can we play at 10.30pm to 11.30pm. the answer is no as we have jobs we have to get to the next day. Not only have we been pushed from our slot for money but the staff called and gave us 1 hours notice both weeks, i forgot to mention they cancelled our game two weeks in a row with no notice, well 1 hr, so I had to inform players that were already driving the game was cancelled. They should  also note that this is the wrong group of people to treat this way as many are valley team managers and heavily involved with valley football. I'm hoping for a response from the owner on treating long serving customers this way for a few extra $.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Name>Gareth Nicholson<//Name></record>

I think Valley Soccer Center is amazing.   I've seen and played at other facilities and I recommend this one to all my friends and colleagues.  The staff is professional and accommodating. 3 fields, and a place to party for special occasions.  This is the spot, that's for sure.</review>

HANDS DOWN BY FAR THE BEST PLACE IN THE WHOLE VALLEY TO PLAY SOCCER !!! If you are a serious soccer player or just looking to kick the ball with a couple friends, this is the facility to be at.
The pictures do not do it justice. The center is in tip top shape and ran smoothly by staff members. Expect the place to fill up with the change in weather. Thanks again will def be back soon !!!< /review>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>Came to this facility to play earlier in the week and the hospitality from the front desk was amazing, The guy name is Allen he's really attentive and makes sure you and your rental is satisfied while playing. They don't give you time to ask for balls nor vests thats how attentive Allen is. Before leaving he was sure to ask if there was any sort of problem while we were their and the answer was NO because he made sure everything was great.<//review>< user_id>

Nice fields and facility.  I remember once they double booked the facility and tried to move us.  A copy of the schedule was on the table and I looked at it (which clearly stated we had a field reserved), the desk boy removed it immediately and told me it was confidential, hah.  Sounds like they will do anything to get a slot filled for more money.  We have a group of around 12 to 14 that show up every week around 9PM.  I don't know the cost of the fields, but they have cancelled on us 2 weeks in a row.  The cancellation notice has been a hour before the game starts both weeks.  This is not cool (I'm not going to elaborate on why).< /text>

A piece of California history you should visit as a side trip through 395. Not necessarily a destination. Due to Covid restrictions the visitor center is closed. Make sure you are careful in the parking lot as big rocks scattered can do some damage to your tires. Also ensure you have quarters for the feeders. Washrooms available.<//Text>

Unfortunately it was closed due to COVID19 but still got to feed the trout and ducks in the pond. There's feed in the machines that only cost a quarter for some feed.

It's a nice relaxing spot to stop and take a break, admire the old fish hatchery, and relax for a moment next to a pond.< /review>

<Review>They are closed on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I didn't get to visit the gift shop or museum. This place is stunning. The Swiss style structure, makes you feel like you're in Europe. Dazzling to see this amazing building in the desert, with Mt Whitney in the background. Worth the view just to take a quick peek.<//Review>< UserId.>

<Response>None</Response><Rate>5</Rate><review>At the small souvenir shop, the curator is friendly and will tell you about the Hatchery's history after your self-tour (donations accepted!). The place experienced a devastating mud-slide & flood a few years ago which ruined the breeding pools, so no more fish are produced here. But the giant pond outside is full of the giant rainbow trout that you can feed -  like a koi pond. Awesome side- diversion off highway 395 near Lone Pine, CA.<//review><user>117988994310463520918< /user><GmapID>0x80bfbee762a9330d:0xc4e51b5793d63277</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Super nice people, volunteers that are rebuilding and managing the hatchery. Please think about making a  donation. Also I recommend buying some fish food and going to the trout pond, it's well stocked and includes some huge rainbow trout, including one absolute tank of a rainbow, by far the largest one I've ever seen.< /Text>

Amazing place to step into history and enjoy the wonderful surroundings of the Sierra Nevadas, chill in the park and feed some fish. Car show is a blast!</Text>

I hiked from the truck stop to the hatchery and along the way discovered a nature trail, spoted 4 deer and crossed a rushing stream before entering the hatchery from above and behind. This gave me a unique experience for my first visit to the site. As I crossed through the abandoned and dry brood tanks to the rear of the hatchery I took many photos, all from varying perspectives. But it wasn't until I came around to the front and saw the pond that the magic really happened. The hatchery was closed due to a lack of a volunteer but I still enjoyed the visit and spoted many large trout in the pond (Polorized sunglasses made that possible) and of at least 2 species. I hiked down the entrance to the hwy to return. Overall about 3.5 miles and a very pleasant hike.< /review>

Even though this is not a Hatchery anymore it is work the visit. There is so much history stored in this place not only about the Hatchery but about the area. Our favorite was the collection of old hunting license.</review>

<Review>We always stop by on our way up or down the 395. There is alot to read and learn inside. It is NOT an active hatchery. However, they do keep one tank running with small fish to show the process. There is a large pond in front of the building with hundreds of and dispensers with food to feed them so bring your QUARTERS!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPspAJhcsgmtPXbMVvGhs0HBw8YyG6k4l30cy1K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2cZ0q3EhHm-v41c001y_BjT59uF4Cy5CdKciK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcTBSH7Y_udhmxxNUBysYZNh2JUl76gdnMYn-U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg7QoaivS6v-6wfIVyaHUnx_SnukBXqOeTCwgq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO-ZzQhb-jkPx_pcTvFcn_upw00pdAV_Iawh5N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80bfbee762a9330d:0xc4e51b5793d63277</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This was a nice place for us to stop and stretch our legs on the way home from Mammoth to LA.  Entrance and parking are free.

Inside the visitors center is a gift shop and hatchery.  We learned about the history of the native fish and how trout are raised and used to stock the lakes in the Eastern Sierras.  We even got to see some baby trout in the hatchery.

Outside, there are grassy areas, picnic tables and clean, flushing bathrooms.  There is a small pond filled with huge trout (but no fishing allowed).  There are fish pellets you can buy for 25 cents from a coin machine.  The fish gobble this stuff up and its fun to watch the fish fight over the food.</Text>< date>

<Text>This place brought back memories of when my dad took us here when I was little. It's no longer producing fish but they had one trough operating that had some fish in it, which was enough to make me remember the dozens of troughs in two rows that were full of tiny fish swimming frantically around. Every trough had a different size of fish in different stages of development. When they were big enough they would be taken to the lakes and rivers of the Sierra. I also remembered the sort of dank smell of so much water inside a building, similar to the smell of an indoor pool. My dad passed a few years ago but I will always appreciate the many interesting places he took us to.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Its a beautiful place. The trout are ginormous. They have a feeding machine that you put a quarter into it, and it gives you trout corn nibble. They go crazy over it. Sadly we went when it wasn't open but just the scenery alone was worth it.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>On our way back from Mammoth, we decided to stop at the Hatchery. This place was so beautiful. They have a front pond with huge rainbow trout. This place is great for kids, this place is no longer a hatchery has been turned into a museum. Make sure to take $$ quarters to feed the trout. It was so much fun!!!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIWOQ5JmK28JeijDZO4OA6PzsbF3Xl3R7hMnlW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

Very Sad To See That People Think That They Are In There Own Backyard And Leave Trash and Cigarette Butts About The Grounds.

Upsetting that VOLUNTEERS are not available? In today's society the older generation could have a Great Place to provide information to the Younger Generation?</text>< Pictures>

A great place to visit when traveling the Eastern Sierra. The kids love feeding the trout in the pond and the history and architecture of the building are fascinating. Once funded by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, this magnificent location is now run entirely by a non-profit organization and volunteers, so please consider leaving even a small donation.< /review>

Beautiful and peaceful.  Great place for picnic.   Feed the fish and ducks in a lovely pond.  Historic building and informative self guided tour.  Less than a mile off highway 395.  An oasis in the desert!< /review>

This is a great place to stop for a visit off the 395 lots of history and beautiful sights to see. Enormous rainbow trout in the front pond fun to feed for the kids. Inside the nearly hundred-year-old building are interesting things on how they hatch fish and have done so in the Sierras.<//Text>

<text>My go to place as I roll up 395.
Feed the Bubba trout in the pond.
Bring quarters. Or buy a bag of trout chow inside.
Enjoy the peaceful grounds.
Bring a lunch.
Wonder at the beautiful rock work in this most historical of places.
Go inside for a slice of history. And information.
Buy some trinkets. As this helps support the beautiful hatchery.
Great for antsy kids on a long ride

A nice place to visit & feed the fish. Get your bag of food inside the building for a bigger bang for the buck. Lots of mulberries on the trees in the spring.
Lots of info inside about trout.
Take a lunch and sit in the soft grass to eat.
The bathrooms are clean.
Staff is friendly.< /text>

Swiss style architecture.  Trout pond is incredible! (huge fish).  Inside, if open, can see and read more about the hatchery and how they raise the fish.  Good place to stop and stretch when driving along 395 and want to avoid the crowds at the typical rest stops.</Text>

Not really a fish hatchery anymore. More of a museum. Apparently they had a bad fire in 2007 and heavy rains the following year, which caused a mudslide which ruined their fish ponds.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Worth a look, it shows a lot of the history of the fish farm. You can also feed the fish in the lake in front of the building.

got my first smart phone and when phone directions didn't work went in at night and saw Jose Gonzalez  at the AT&T store in Westlake Village..  He took a "dumb phone" expert and got me not only up and running, but took the time and patience to give me lessons on the most important features I use all the time.  Gave me enough info, and took the time to let me practice with him, so I left feeling confident enough to not panic when I have to actually use the phone, and when I try and learn more of it's features. Went in upset with the situation and your professional, calming, articulate employee,  Jose,  made it a pleasant  educational experience.<//text>

This positive review is 100% because of Briana Martinez, the Westlake Village store's manager. Briana goes above and beyond for every customer who enters the store. In all honesty, when she's not there, the vibe of the store is very different. Nobody even acknowledges you until it's your turn which can be 2+ hours. With Briana, not only does she greet everyone who walks in the store, but she also checks in to see why they are there. This is helpful because sometimes waiting two hours could be a major time waste and she let's you know right away if they can help. In addition, Briana multi tasks and helps 2-3 people at once and does so with ease. She's always so accommodating and extremely helpful. Briana is a star manager and it's because of her that I keep coming back.< /Text>

Never again. You will NOT get good service here.  First I was eligible for the upgrade then as rep, Emery? was transferring all the data from old to new phone, he THEN sees scratches.. hairline at the top... tells me he won't accept phone since it's scratched and I can either buy outright or fix screen (somewhere else since they don't do it). So why didn't he see these "scratches" before transfer? I told him I didn't have time to transfer back but didn't want to fork over 800 bucks. He sat back and said, well there's nothing else I can do. So 800 bucks later, I called store next week and they said "well why didn't you accept the 350 trade in". WHY wasn't I offered that Emery??? Horrible service. Awful company. Oh and best buy OR Costco would have accepted the phone. Go there instead.<//Review>

We switched our 6 phones from Verizon to ATT. Alex helped us and made what always seems to take forever go so quickly. She was very knowledgeable and patient with us. I highly recommend this store and ask for Alex, she’s the best!</review>

I’ve been here twice now and was lucky enough to have Alex help me! She is AMAZING! Knowledgeable, charming, helpful above and beyond! When she’s helping you, you feel she’s covering every base and making sure you get the best attention and the best deal!!</Review>

<time>1612487755668</time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Stopped into the Westlake ATT store for problems with a mobile account and the manager, Brianna Martinez, was not only attentive and helpful, she was extraordinarily patient with ATT on the phone as the account was so old that info could be readily accessed. We spent two full hours with one department after another on the phone as well as online and Brianna never became impatient. It is a pleasure to see customer service still a priority at this local business. Thank you, Brianna and also Alex who worked cheerfully in a frustrating situation to rectify the issue.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
My transition from another cellular carrier to ATT was not smooth.  I spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to research issues online on my own without success, and then called ATT customer service for assistance.  I had to speak with 4 different reps, going around in circles, and was then finally pointed to the need for me to go to an ATT store.

My experience at the Westlake Village store on Thousand Oaks Blvd was excellent.   Alex listened to my issues and then courteously and knowledgeably worked to resolve them.  She was efficient and offered clear explanations in response to my questions.  All appears to be settled now, and I am hopeful that I will continue to be satisfied going forward with ATT.</Review>

Alex, who had worked at the newbury location before it closed was thankfully transferred over to the Westlake location. Alex is extremely knowledgeable, professional, and just down to earth in general. She helped me with multiple phones, and getting my new one set up, and ceared out my iphoneX so I could give to my dad;) along with getting all the deals I could, plus she’s just cool af in general. Brianna helped me out as well, those two are some hard working chicks and know what they are doing. I’d give them 10stars if I could. I’m extremely satisfied w AT&T staff at the Westlake location near tjs. Thanks again, girls!

I didn't trust the expertise of the employees in this store. I told them that I was setting up a hot spot that I would use about once a year and I suspect that they set me up for a substantial bill for once every month. Update: As I suspected, i received another bill for $83. How many hundreds of dollars would YOU be willing to spend to use a hot spot for one week? Now I have to go through a big fight with AT&T.<//Text>

<review>I brought my girlfriend in here at AT&T in Westlake to get a charger. We had absolutely the best customer service that anybody could ever want. She went above and beyond. Help my girlfriend with everything for her new phone. Plus we had a good time while she was transferring all her information. I wanted my girlfriend to come to the store because I come here all the way from Oxnard because of the wonderful customer service here. This is my favorite AT&T store on the planet. I've had AT&T for about 25 years. But nothing surpasses the customer service that we got from Brianna.
Thank you for hiring such a wonderful employee.
She has been a gift to us.
Sincerely

Today I came in to At&t store and received excellent excellent customer service care from Briana I came in with a serious trouble. I just got a new phone and did not understand how to use it. she transferred all my information and did everything for me with a perfect smile just a lovely gracious lady and I feel very lucky to have met her today because she took a lot of worry off of me today and she is the greatest employee . At&t is very lucky to have her trust me the the main deal with your employees is how to get along with others and she is superlative, I can't say enough the very best about her thank you for for everything.

When I see something good I’d like to acknowledge that. I’ve been so fortunate to have Briana help me time and time again. She’s  knowledgeable and helpful, and I’m so grateful for her assistance. You’re so fortunate to have her as an employee.

Every time my wife and I go to At&t, we always get a warm greeting by Steven. He is such a knowledgable sales rep and delivers great customer service! We drive all they way from Santa Clarita just to go to Steven if we have any issues with cellphones or questions regarding Direct TV. Highly Recommended!!!< /Review>

Brianna is just salesman at the end of the day. I signed up and she was very cool and promised a $100.00 gift card, said it would arrive in 3 weeks. It never arrived. After two months on service and due to the fires I had to relocate and AT&T was not available in my area so I had to cancel.
I called to ask Brianna about my gift card that I still had not received and she said "no you have to be on service for 3 months in order to receive your gift card". I said that is not what you told me and she argued with me about it.  She was nice when she was selling the product. It's this type of slippery sales gimmicks that really gets under your skin.<//review>

Don't waste your time here. The reps who used to work here knew what they were doing. But the current reps are ignorant. Brianna has stolen customer trade in phones, plus she smokes and drinks on the job. In addition she will try and withhold Information about what your actually paying, and will give you the run around and refuse to help you if she has made a mistake. Trust me when I tell you I saw it firsthand for many many months! Go to the corporate store this entire "spring" company is shady!<//text>

Only two employees, but the one I talked to was helpful. Came in to switch four lines from T-Mobile and got it done pretty quickly.

EDIT (originally 4 stars): Employee apparently put my account on the wrong unlimited plan. However, a quick call to 611 solved the problem.</Text>

I have to say, I was most impressed with the staff at this location. Our family was greeted by Steven as soon as we walked in the store, even as he was working with another customer. He was smiling and friendly, which is a stark contrast to our experience at our previous network provider. The other staff members were all busy restocking, cleaning and waiting on another customer in the store.

With the uptick in school shootings and lockdowns, we wanted our children to have phones for emergency purposes. We were not well schooled in options and Jesseca, the manager, sat with us and provided myriad options as well as plans. While we were working with Jesseca, Brianna, the assistant manager, showed our children the phones so they could try them and see what would work best for them. It took us a bit, but we zeroed in on the right phones and plan.

As we were working on the paperwork, Jesseca noticed my phone and asked if I had seen the new IPhone 10’s. I had not, so she showed us the phones and checked my plan. It turns out I was due for an upgrade and didn’t know it. Alex, another employee, went to the back to check the inventory to ensure they had the IPhone I wanted. Jesseca checked my plan to see if I had the correct one for my usage and I did not. She put us on a family plan, saved us money, got emergency phones for our children and even checked our DirectTv plan to see if it needed adjusted.

Time is something we don’t have enough of, so to have a salesperson, let alone an entire staff, care enough to check our phones & plans to get us the best deal, was truly a time saving and refreshing experience. Steven and Alex, along with Jesseca, also worked with us to ensure we all understood how to use our new phones. We have since sent in three of our friends for family plans.

I can see why they were all smiling when we arrived. It is obvious they enjoy working together and their job. Thank you all for a truly wonderful phone shopping experience!< /review>

I returned the 6s of got from them but they never updated my at&t bill. This is a 3 party retail store.  Not AT&T. Spring mobile.  I called them and they only notated account.  It's now becoming a nightmare to adjust my account over the phone.  These stores should only be allowed to sell prepaid stuff. If you want AT&T, go to an actual store.</text>

This is fro the new location next to the Trader Joe's in Westlake Village:

I cannot praise this store enough. Sebastian and his crew provides the best customer service I have ever encountered, hands down, When they didn't have the correct phone  in stock  for my daughter, he insisted on making a special trip to Calabasas to accommodate us. On another occasion I bought a new Iphone 7 and Sebastian personally helped us with all of the transfers and setup. Also, I had a major issue with an ATT billing error, Sebastian spent nearly 3 hours on the phone helping us set things right. I have never felt rushed or ignored. They treat every person like they are the only customer in the store.This is where I will be doing all of my cellular business from now on. And so should you!</text>

<Review>This store is so badly managed. I bought a phone and an iPad Air 2 for my wife's birthday. They didn't have it in stock so they promised they would have it delivered to the Pleasent Hill store in the SF Bay Area, where were going. I called on the 20th, her birthday, and no iPad. It turned out they sent it 2nd day, and therefore, useless to me. I ordered the iPad on Aug. 18th and as of Sep. 5th the iPad is still no where to be found. Buy from Best Buy or something like that. This store is totally miss managed and completely useless.</Review><time>1441486840153< /time>< response>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>I tried the Gyro wrap and it was really good.
However, unfortunately I can't say the same for the service.
I would like to offer a small peace of advice:
There are two main reasons why a restaurant succeeds.
#1 is the quality of food.
#2 is the service.
In order to succeed, you must have both, not just one.
I Drove a long way to try this place, and I was greeted by a not so pleasant server /host.
I don't understand this, if you don't like working with people, please don't work at a restaurant.
Therefore, unfortunately despite the good food, I can't recommend it.
To me, service is as important as the food.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoj5jd69AqGcritfz6z3Kbfh6BMFj5UnqjXLcF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

Troys never disappoints when I want an amazing falafel wrap! Their fries are also very tasty and crisp every time. Authentic flavors in all the foods prepared there, and great prices for the amount and quality.<//text>

Decent food. Just ate here outside on the sidewalk area. They have a few tables and maybe not the best dining experience but these days one can't be picky. I ordered a shawarma and it was good but I would have considered it a gyro because of the wrap that they were using but I understand that is a technically.</Review>

<Review>Troy is our go-to for quick Greek food. They have a menu that makes me always want to have a little of everything. Our kids love their rice pilaf, and we enjoy their horiatiki salad (although I am a fan of big chunks rather seeing it prepared as an Americanized salad). Service is fast for takeout if you beat the dinner rush< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Healthy, fast, tasty Greek food. The Chicken Salad is excellent. If you are tired of chicken their grilled lamb with salad is also eccellent. My buddy had the felafel and said it was also very good.</Text>

Troy is simply amazing! Luma, the store manager is super sweet and provides the best service. Foodwise, I'm a HUGE fan of the Greek fries, and enjoy their gyro meat as well. Check this place out!< /text>

Despite my complaint, I gotta admit that their food tastes great. I'd say it's one of the better Greek restaurants. But frankly, it's disgusting when my friends and I find a hair strand every two months.

First time it happened was in January and we let it go because we understood that everyone's prone to mistake. Second time it happened was in March and we notified the owner and manager; I noticed that some employees weren't wearing head wraps so I told them about it. They said they'll be careful. It happened for the third time today.

This has been going on every third or fourth order we placed for the past seven months, which is a clear sign that the owner and managers fail to acknowledge this problem and don't care about fixing it.

And this is for some doubters out there: No, we did not finish more than half of the dish and returned it for refund or coupon.

It's disgusting. If they can't even prevent the most basic issue like this, imagine countless other sanitation issues that are ongoing in the kitchen. This restaurant's cleanliness and sanitation is way below normal.

Don't go to this restaurant; it's disgusting and its owner and managers don't care if you swallow a strand of hair in your plate or gyro. If you still go here, enjoy looking out for a strand of hair before taking every bite.< /review>

You probably are safer ordering a wrap. The plate had a warm tomato salad and came with more grilled onions than chicken, and the menu had no mention of onions as an ingredient.< /review>

Amazing Mediterranean food. My parents had Mediterranean for the first time here and they loved it. They had the moussaka and lamb kabob plates. I had the chicken wrap with fries and it was yummy.<//Text>

Great comfort food! Definitely try the Gyros. A little small inside so ordering for pickup isn't a bad idea. But if you get the chance get a table inside! I would say that the small size is part of the charm.< /Text>

This place has really good chicken souvlaki that is not dry like other places. Portion size is enough for two people.</Text>

Absolutely delicious food. Gyros and chicken are great and lamb is amazing (lamb can be hit and miss elsewhere but here it is like steak). Quite fast service too.</Review>

< Review>
Started off with Spinach pie. Wasn't good at all. So don't get the Spinach pie. Though when I had every little hope left for the food my Gyro came. Which was the BEST GYRO I HAVE EVER HAD! Definitely get the Gyro you wont regret it. Also a very affordable price so definitely a Plus! Great place to eat.<//Review>

I don’t recommend this place at all , We just got food and it taste bad , terrible a waste of money  , the pita bread totally stale and you can actually smell it and the lamb/beef meat dry , nothing compare to the other locations I went to. You guys need to really take care of your food if is bad don’t sell it AT ALL , I wish I can make you guys try my order rightnow and you won’t even eat it I’m not coming all the way back for this , I want a refund !!</text>

<Review>This is the best Greek food in Alameda. There are 3 Greek places on the same street, but this is the only restaurant that makes all their dishes in house (including the Falafel). Great service as well.</Review>< gmapID>

Gryos are awesome and delicious! It's a small little restaurant with great service. Gyros are about $8 and fries are $2.50. LAMB AND PITA BREAD, FTW!< /review>

Ordered off the catering menu for a corporate lunch and we were HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.  We ordered a large combo platter with lamb, chicken, gyros; an additional 8-10 gyros; a pan of veggies; and a few orders of falafel, dolmas, & spanikopita.  Paid approximately  $350.  The portions were very small...not enough to feed the amount of people we planned and ordered for.  The gyros were MEAT ONLY...? No pita bread, produce, or sauces.  The definition of gyro is meat wrapped in pita bread w/ produce & sauce.  When I called and told them, they explained their catering menu was meat only for gyros.  Seriously!? Where does it state that? Why would anyone assume that? Service was friendly and food was good but they lost our business.  The veggie pan was super expensive and was extremely small! Well, another Greek restaurant just got our business...@ least $400 per month.

Great medical office, wonderful and warm experience from start to finish. Brought my 75 year old mother for neck & back pain. I appreciate Dr. Loder taking time to go over the diagnosis clearly and treatment options. Thank you Dr Loder for your wonderful care. You have a lovely combination of professionalism and caring and I appreciate it very much.. highly recommend to anyone.< /text>

Everyone is very welcoming and efficient. There wasn’t a moment while waiting that I felt like I didn’t know what was going on. The staff made my visit very comfortable and I felt fully informed before I even saw Dr. Loder. Once I saw the doctor, you could see it’s his personality that permeates to his staff. He took the time to let me know what to expect for my condition and eased any concerns I had about my progression. Great people form top to bottom in this office.<//review>

My Spine Symptom Score was 54 before surgery and my score has improved to 78 so far!

Thank you DOCS Surgery Center and Daniel Loder for helping me get such a great outcome!

Really having a great experience with Dr. Loder. He’s been an excellent diagnostician and my pain has made significant improvements. Thank you Dr. Loder!<//Text>< pictures>

Establishment was very clean and covid compliant. Ample parking along with friendly staff. Front door was a little hard to find but it was like one of the speakeasy’s hahaha. Anyways once inside took literally 3 minutes for someone to bring me to my room while continuing to fill out my paperwork. Usually im use to office staff rushing me or letting people infront of me further delaying my appointment time. Not the case here. After being greated by a very kind a knowledgeable man who made me feel alot better about a procedure that im dreading. Honestly looking forward to my surgery and getting back to work< /Review>

Everyone is very welcoming and efficient. There wasn’t a moment while waiting that I felt like I didn’t know what was going on. The staff made my visit very comfortable and I felt fully informed before I even saw Dr. Loder. Once I saw the doctor, you could see it’s his personality that permeates to his staff. He took the time to let me know what to expect for my condition and eased any concerns I had about my progression. Great people form top to bottom in this office.< /Review>

Thank you DOCS Surgery Center and Daniel Loder for helping me get such a great outcome!

Really having a great experience with Dr. Loder. He’s been an excellent diagnostician and my pain has made significant improvements. Thank you Dr. Loder!</review><date>1615936641356< /date>< name>

<resp>None</resp><Review>Establishment was very clean and covid compliant. Ample parking along with friendly staff. Front door was a little hard to find but it was like one of the speakeasy’s hahaha. Anyways once inside took literally 3 minutes for someone to bring me to my room while continuing to fill out my paperwork. Usually im use to office staff rushing me or letting people infront of me further delaying my appointment time. Not the case here. After being greated by a very kind a knowledgeable man who made me feel alot better about a procedure that im dreading. Honestly looking forward to my surgery and getting back to work<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The manager and employee were arguing with saying that the address they have on file was different however we ordered on the app and the address was correct. The management was very rude yelling at me when I already told her that their store was the one I ordered from told her multiple times it was. When asked to cancel she yelled yet again that she did not want to assume that was our order. After all this the order was canceled. Worst manager and employees.</Text>

I wish there was a 0 star to give. Very disgusting and horrible management. They humiliated my friend and disrespected him for not seeing the sign on the door. Someone needs to shut this business down and save the dignity of others. This place has already a very bad feedback. Unfortunately, majority of customers dont check reviews but THE CORPORATE can do something, hurry and take steps to save your hard earned name.</review>

<review>Terrible service!! I called the store in Alhambra, Ca. about 4:45 to order a pizza and was put on hold. After over 10 minutes on hold, I hung up and called again. Again, I was put on hold and kept waiting. I guess they forgot me and don’t want my business. That’s okay. I DON’T want or need Dominos!!!</review>< rating>

Guys, this pizza place in Alhambra is my favorite! We have had a few mishaps but nothing they haven’t fixed, In fact they have gone above and beyond. Definitely 100% recommended this establishment.
Thank you guys for everything! 💖</text>

<text>Update 8/18/20: I frequent this Dominos location and always have a great experience. The food is good and the service is good. Tonight I ordered online and drove to the store to pick up my usual order. The woman at the store seemed to be working alone. She was not wearing a mask. She didn't wear a mask while preparing, handling or packaging food, while answering the phone, or when a guest entered the building. In my opinion, she should have been wearing a mask even if she was working alone.

Previous review:
I ordered an alfredo pasta bowl with diced tomatoes and they DIDN'T assume I meant that I wanted chicken. I can't count the number of times I've ordered vegetarian alfredo from Dominos and found chicken in my dish.</text>< gmap_id>

<date>1536042721967< /date><rate>1</rate><text>I just feel it's such a shame that the employees at this location have Miriam as their store manager. A store manager should set the example of great customer service to their team members and that is something this girl failed to do. She is very rude on the phone and in person, definately not a way to treat a customer that has purchased Dominos for more than 2 decades. I definately encourage other customers to take a little  time to call corporate if you get this type of service. I now have to drive to a farther location to just not come across this person with such negative vibe.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I ordered a pizza online, which I have done many times with these guys and there is online tracker that tells you exactly the stages the pizza is in when they are making the pizza, which is great! I called on a very busy night and I expected it to be a long wait. It has been over an hour and it still hasn't shown that the pizza was even out of the "Prep" phase. I called this Dominos and right away, "It's on the way." So I was like, this is great! I guess the online tracker isn't accurate. 45 minutes go by and I am wondering why my pizza hasn't been delivered yet since it's only 1.5 miles away. Turns out, it has even been made yet. Once I called again, I finally see the pizza tracker move into the "Baking" phase. I wish they were just honest with me, I could have just cancelled and got something else. Instead I was just waiting there, and it took over two hours to get my ONE pizza. I called again and the person says, "If you want to cancel, I can cancel for you." I mean, at this point, it's been two hours, if I cancel now, then it would just have been two hours wasted. Nonetheless, quite disappointed that they just said whatever they could to keep my order. Could have just been honest, because I understood it was busy. I would have still come back to order again. Not anymore though. It was a good run guys.< /text>

Called to check on the order only to be placed on hold twice by 2 different people and then hung up on. This place is only a 2 min drive away from me yet took almost half an hour to be delivered. Don't order from here, THEY SUCK! Customer service is a joke.</Review>< Response>

<Text>The pizza tracker sucks, so does the store that's trying to keep up with it. The tracker said that my order was ready for pickup, but the store said they just started making it, which took another 15 minutes to be ready. What kind of customer service is that!?<//Text>< pictures>

I go here quite often and every time I come I get great service from the man who always helps me. Tonight when I called to place my normal order Guadalupe answered the phone and she was very RUDE. she tryed to charge me more then what I pay then would put me on hold without even knowing while she took other peoples orders! Then a young got on the phone and said hello and when I said hello back he put the phone down. I think that's disrespectful to cut off your customer and attend to other things while they are still talking.< /Text>

<Date>1449727400811<//Date><text>Question for Those who have ordered On Line and Paid with Credit Card on the website.
I know its common for them to check ID / Credit when they deliver the orderz but have any of you had one of the Delivery people copy down you Complete Credit Card # on the stores receipt. I asked the guy last time and he said it's policy.. I got the receipt and ripped off the part where he copied my CC#..
No one should have a physical copy of your CC.. maybe write down the last 4#s to make sure it matches but theres no reason they should copy your whole cc#.. am.I crazy?.or do places like Dominos have a right to do that?<//text></record>

<Text>HORRIBLE. First time I ordered from this Dominoes, the pizza showed up late and COLD. This time, they put the toppings all over the pizza instead of only on one side, as I had ordered.

<Text>Terrible. I live less than a half a mile away and the delivery driver didn't even make it to my front door. I called the shop and the girl who answered was rude and not helpful at all. I am contacting corporate on this store.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>We came in on the weekend and really enjoyed our happy hour at the bar - we didn't have much, but everything was uniformly on point. Really solid classic cocktails, and the fried chicken sandwich was excellent. Chill vibe at the bar and a very pleasant way to spend our afternoon - can't ask for much more from HH.</Text>< Pics>

This place is filled with people lining up to get a taste of their ribs, onion rings, brisket, and more. Even though there may be a wait for a table, the staff is friendly and the service is quick. Customers rave about the quality and portion size of the dishes, saying that it’s not too greasy like other BBQ spots. I so love it!< /text>

Of the different restaurants in the Marina district, I never imagined finding a place with such excellent service and exquisite food.  I definitely recommend this restaurant, the best in the area with a great quality of workers.< /review>

<Review>Great happy hour drink and snack specials, that includes classic cocktails beer and wine. It also includes bar snacks like Rosemary french fries, fried pickles and oysters. Great place to go and have a drink and meet friends. Also seemed very popular for dinner. Though you probably should have a reservation if you plan to eat dinner there.</Review>< Rate>

I do recommend coming here especially during twilight or night time because the ambiance is very comforting. They're several dishes here we wanted to try such as the Macaroni & Cheese dishes and blends, but since it was just two of us, we gladly just settled for coming back another time since we live literally behind the building lol!< /Text>

<text>A wonderful restaurant. Mostly seafood on the menu so I know that's not for everyone but, you've been warned. Great wine selection along with some equally excellent cocktails. The food is so tasty and the entrees have a good size so when you leave you leave satisfied. Highly recommend<//text>< pics>

<text>It would have been a 5 Star, but the service was a bit on the slower side. The food was delicious and the ambiance was great. I think that if you order an appetizer and go with friends to relax and enjoy yourself (or company) with a cocktail or wine you wouldn't notice the food taking a bit longer to come out. Full disclosure, I was starving when I came in.<//text>< Response>

Great food and service. Relaxed, but upscale in terms of food and drink quality,  nice bar area. I would choose Maybecks over local steakhouse options if you're looking for creative American cuisine as opposed to old standards.< /text>

I noticed the head chef and owner Eric wining and dining other diners. While I was at the bar not even busy totally ignored me. When it was 7 pm time for invoke folks to come back to the kitchen for beef Wellington Show and tell I wasn’t invited.  So who is to blame here? The chef or the waiter? The chef was looking at the computer system and noticing who was who ordering what. However never bothered to chat with me ? Chef Aaron you claim to be diverse WRONG! Cher Eric you have failed here when I brought up the issue. It clearly shows you cater to  white folks but claims to be diverse. How dare you sir !!!! Shame on you !

You may have the best beef Wellington but clearly shows you don’t have the diversity to cater to all.

This place is ok get a place I can recommend to my fiends and clients.

Maybeck’s, your chefs attitude clearly shows the lack of or respect and diversity in the city of San Francisco.<//text>

I would like to give this four stats, as most of the food was quite tasty. However at this price point expectations increase for service (they did not put in my order for a cocktail), noise (a loud birthday party), a lack of vegetarian offerings, and fish and chips served with roasted potatoes in lieu of the chips.</review>

< Review>
This is a great dinner spot for a cold SF evening. Our first impression was that the vibe was cozy, and while the place was packed on a Saturday evening, it wasn't too loud.

I would describe the menu as upscale comfort food. We had tomato soup and mac n' cheese, followed by the burger (not on the menu, but they said they always have it) and fried chicken with a side of brussels sprouts. Nothing adventurous, but everything was delicious. The fried chicken in particular was some of the best I've had. It was unbelievably crispy on the outside with some combination of spices and... maple syrup I think? And the chicken itself was still nice and moist.

I also loved the hot chiles in the  mac n' cheese and the chile sauce on the brussels, as I'm a fan of spice, while my girlfriend who doesn't like as much spice wasn't overwhelmed.

Portions are big. We had leftovers.

We will definitely be back.</Review>

The bartender was attentive, friendly and provided great food & cocktail recommendations. The radiatore, garlic bread, side of kale and molten chocolate cake are all amazing!

The best spaghetti I've ever had! The meatballs were superb.  The service was outstanding!   We flew back to NYC wishing we could take some pasta home with us.  Absolutely recommend this classy place.< /review>

Great service stars at this hearty California cuisine sleeper. Surprisingly fashionable interior offers lounge area and subtle elegance in main dining room. Eclectic menu offers Beef Wellington, crab pasta, fried chicken, oysters and more. Varied wine list and deftly made Manhattans impressed.< /text>

Great, cozy spot in the marina that took over the recently closed Republic location. Great food and drinks selection with friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff/bartenders. I'm going to have to come back with a couple more friends to tackle the Flannery’s Dry Aged Prime New York Steak.</Text>

It really wasn't anything to write home about even though they are billing it as a hot new American dining destination. Best thing to do is to grab a cocktail in the bar/lounge area (which are quite good, so ask the bartender for a recommendation) and then head to dinner somewhere else like A16 or The Dorian.<//Review><rating>3</rating>< Pictures>

The beef wellington is all that at Maybecks.  Unfortunately,  I missed the ceremonial slicing bc we had trouble parking so we were late by 5 mins.  Arrive before 7pm if you want to see this.

The meat was incredibly tender and delicious. Perfection.

The "famous" garlic bread was okay.  It left a weird,  powdery after taste in my mouth and was very wet. I'll skip this next time.

BF says the steak tartare was the best he's ever had. And he can say that bc he's ordered it at some of SF'S finest and long establishments.

He also ordered the linguini with clams.  He rates it a B; says it was okay; pasta was a little gummy.

Cocktails are solid. A+

Desserts are solid.  A+ the ice cream flavors are outstanding. They offer a moan worthy chocolate molten cake that is heaven.

Service: the hostess was incredibly nice,  genuine and warm.

Our waiter was eric. He is very straight forward. He did his job. He wasn't warm, or engaging,  nor was he rude. Just straight forward. Probably best for introverts who prefer to eat alone at the bar.<//Text>

Why only 4 stars ? Everything is awsome exept the chairs. One of my Friend was complaining about that his leg getting numb and my other Friend was saying that her back hurted after 2 hour sitting. However the Food is very teasty and the place gets crowed and lively on Saturday after 7.30 pm.</text>

Hal is a cocktail wizard. Chefs get him great ingredients and whip him up custom syrups and infusions and such, but even with just booze and bitters he will make your mouth cry tears of joy. Speaking of the chefs, I've never had anything less than incredible here. Radiatori pasta with fermented chile oil and pork is a go-to, and the cioppino will just ruin you for all other foods. Why is it in the Marina? I don't know. But at least it means there's street parking to be found.</Review>

Classic cocktail service without hipster pretension. They're going to know your favorite call, and they won't try to sell you on some overly-sophisticated "craft boutique bespoke cocktail" menu. They have it, but they respect people who know what they want.

I said my reviews would get shorter....

Go. It's loud, casual, and spendy... a deal breaker for some of the old timers in town. This is overly casual, and so I end up overdressed, as I am prone to do. The servers are fantastic and fun, while still being skilled and knowing boundaries.

Toasted Raviolis are wonderful. The Spagettini Uni is a must try. So interesting and balanced in the flavor profile.. no huge head explosion or surprise as so many restaurants attempt.

But just GO.. you don't need my ridiculous course after course description. This is a great treat and one of the lovely meals out that isn't overly dressy while still being modern fine dining without tablecloths... ie the heart and soul comes from the kitchen, and the front of house is there to execute that, and not the other way around.</Text>

<text>I had the pleasure of dining at Spaghetti Brothers last night and have already recommended the establishment to several friends, as well as my family. Will (GM) and Ron (the man behind the bar) took excellent care of me and the food that the kitchen produced is unparalleled in the area...I'd put the quality up there with the Mission's Foreign Cinema, no joke. First, let's start with the decor and general ambiance - its like stepping back in time a half-century to an older San Francisco. As for the food, the avocado toast with pecorino is the best I've had in SF and the halibut crudo was nothing short of exquisite. In fact, the fish was so good that I ordered the halibut entree, which was served exactly as halibut should be - flaky and tender, without falling apart on my fork. The cocktail list was designed by Will, who is himself an expert mixologist and a restauranteur I've been following since his work at Bix. I'd highly recommend one of their gin cocktails, like the Velvet Hammer. Last, but certainly not least, the dessert. I don't often order dessert, but had to try the Strawberry 'Good Humor' and it did not disappoint. Though reminiscent of the ice cream bars I used to get from the truck, this new take on an old classic redefined my appreciation for something as (seemingly) simple as strawberries with ice cream. I plan to come back as soon as my schedule (and stomach) allows. Bravo Spaghetti Bros!<//text>< pics>

<user>103561819551846819987</user><review>Excellent find for us one late Wednesday evening when we were all walking back from a concert at the Palace of Fine Arts. The staff are wonderful, friendly, and attentive (of course they've only been open for about a month). We the threesome  were very well taken care of throughout the meal.

Drinks we had:
The Dubliner - Perfect for the slightly cool evening, very nicely balanced though a bit low on the whiskey :).
French Negroni - Lovely gin in the Negroni. It even had BYRRH in the ingredients (sorry). My friend enjoyed this immensely.
Figone Negroni  - This was nice my friend said he liked it.

Food we had:
Spaghetti - Home made spaghetti was really just perfect. Ever so slightly under-cooked which to me is the perfect spaghetti and it was bursting with flavor if that's even possible. The restaurant lives up to its name.
Buratta - The cheese and the little gem lettuce was pretty good.
Clam Linguine - Linguine was again far above par the clams were perfectly cooked.
Prosciutto & Gridled Spiced Pears - The prosciutto had a lovely smell and texture and the pears really were perfectly gridled. Not at all overcooked (not easy).

Highly recommend the place for a nice evening dinner.</review></record>

<Text>I had heard great things about this place and I was super excited to try it. Ultimately, though, it fell short of the hype.

Came here on a Friday night around 8:00pm with a friend. The place was buzzing but not packed and we were seated immediately. We shared a few small plates:

Burrata salad - 5-stars. I was hesitant about the burrata salad as it was pricy and I feel like so often, a dish like this comes with a hint of burrata and a ton of salad. This was exactly the opposite. A good sized chunk of creamy, thick, flavorful burrata was served with the perfect amount of salt and pepper on top. It was complemented by crunchy hazelnuts and tart citrus, making a well rounded plate. I could have eaten this forever and I savored every last bite.

Sausage plate - 3-stars. The sausage was well cooked, but not as flavorful as I was hoping for. The dish overall felt quite boring... a single piece of sausage cut into slices, accompanied by a couple of greens. The salsa was the most exciting part of the dish, tasting strongly of onion and bringing some brightness to the plate.

Prosciutto - 4-stars. The star of this dish was the pear! I was so surprised. The prosciutto was good, but I mean, it's a standard cured meat, it's hard to make this really bad or really special. The pear though, that was everything. The pears were charred but not mushy at all, still incredibly firm. They had a strong black pepper flavor that came together nicely with the salty meatiness of the prosciutto and the sweetness from the pear. The textures matched perfectly. Really nice touch.

Overall, I wasn't wowed. I'd come back but I'm not running over.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808580d41dca9715:0x9686683c014d7b68<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>A&E was supposed to send diagnosis to their own department. Then that department is supposed to send it to Amer. Home Shield. This went back and forth for 2 months. A&E said call AHS. AHS says callA&E. A&E says there is no way for them to know if the information has been sent to AHS. All they can do is request that it be sent in 24 hrs but it never gets sent. Just request after request. Astounding they stay in business.<//Text><username>Pam Rab<//username>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Tech diagnosed the problem by just looking at the dryer.  No testing done.  No screws removed. No diagnostics done.  Told us he just "knew" without testing and we should buy a new dryer from Sears, then demanded payment. We got more good info from Youtube than that guy. You should be ashamed Sears.<//Review>

<Text>I scheduled an appointment with Sears appliance repair because my 9-year-old Kenmore refrigerator was freezing food in the refrigerator. On the day of the appointment, the technician called me from his prior appointment to confirm, but I was on another call and could not pick up. He left a voicemail but by the time I heard it and responded to him 20 minutes later he had skipped my appointment and gone to the one after me.

In this day and age of robocallers, I don't know many people that answer the phone when the call is from a number not in their contact list. Sears should change this policy of its technicians calling on the day of the appointment to reconfirm the appointment after it has already been confirmed online multiple times.

Sears rescheduled my appointment for 2 days later and the technician came and diagnosed three issues with my refrigerator. Since one of the parts is not available any longer, I decided to purchase it used from eBay and make the repairs myself.

Sears does charge $129 as a diagnosis fee simply for showing up to the appointment, And this does not include the labor fee for doing the repairs themselves if you have Sears repair your appliance, then the $129 fee is deducted from the total cost of the repairs. if it's worth it to you to pay $129 to hear a professional diagnosis of your appliance's issues, then Sears may be a good option for you. There are online sites with appliance repair experts that you can chat with or speak to to help diagnose your issue and purchase quality parts for less from them, as well.< /Text><username>Ned Gosaynie</username><resp>None< /resp></record>

<Review>The repair was done in two parts due to the fact that first technician didn't have a replacement spare part in his van. First technician was wearing a mask and shoes protection. After ordering the needed spare part and schedule another appointment to complete the repair. A week later a different technician came to complete the repair. This gentleman didn't wear a mask and also didn't have a protection on his shoes.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1600377265902, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave us your rating.

After 3 weeks we have had absolutely no service.  A 3rd party repairman came and said that it was the compressor and a Sears repairman would have to fix it, he couldn't do it.  Said that he would call Sears.  After over 2 weeks and several phone calls to Sears and the 3rd party company who never returned my phone calls Sears still thinks that my refrigerator/freezer was repaired.  Sears wanted to send the 3rd party again but I told them no, they couldn't fix it before and they were just delaying getting the part ordered and getting it fixed.  Have to wait another 72 hours to hopefully get a response from Sears as to weather they will send a Sears repairman.  We do have the Sears Protection Plan and our refrigerator is only 4 years old.  We have had Kenmore appliances for over 48 years and have never had this issue.< /review>

<Text>Andre is one of the nicest, respectful, knowledgeable technicians that has  ever come to my residence to repair my appliances . He was dressed impeccable!! He was clean, neat and shoes shined like he is/was a military man or a first responder . He obviously cares about his appearance and the service he provides. You truly have an asset working for your company. You should hire more people like Andre or better yet have Andre as a trainer to teach your employees how to address their customers and how to dress. Sears should also get rid of all outside vendors due to their lack of professionalism and lack of poor repair ethics.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1580751142611, 'text': 'We are so glad to hear that your technician was excellent during your service experience.

Our 10 year old Kenmore Pro Built in refrigerator would not cool properly. The freezer and fridge ran too warm. So I called Sears for a repair.

First the Good: The repair technicians are really nice and decent.

The Bad: To book an appointment for a repair is a process. Was on hold for 22 minutes and finally gave up and tried the next day. Finally got through the second time and had to wait for two weeks to get an appointment to fix our refrigerator.

It took 4 service calls and over one month to hopefully correct the problem. And although the first, second and third repairs didn't fix the problem we had to sign for additional parts and service charges during each call even though the Sears policy is a 90 day warranty. The repairmen assured us we would not be billed and it was merely for their records. Will see...….<//Text>

<review>Repairmen were cordial. Mt issue is with your product. My ice machine to my Kenmore fridge stopped working in November of last year. A repairman repaired it and charged around $260. Last week I had another Sears repairman arrive for the same issue and was told the previous work was a temporary repair and I now need a Freezer door. I informed him I will not replace the freezer door and assured him I will NEVER purchase a Sears Kenmore product again and if asked I will no longer recommend your product. Very Disappointing!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I have found Sears Appliance Repair excellent. The technicians are knowledgeable, helpful and professional.  They are equipped to repair
other appliances besides Sears.  I find the technicians are very well trained. I recommend them highly. I have a very old washing machine & the technician has successfully repaired it every time.<//Text>

The repairman came, said he could not get the part and that I would need a whole new ice machine, total bill $360.
I was flustered and said okay.
AFTER the new ice machine was installed, I asked if he could have ordered the part. He said it would have taken around nine days to receive it and I would have had to pay for him to come out again. I said "NO, your website says that if you don't have the part, you will come back for free. He seemed unaware of that policy. I looked on the web and I could get the part for $7.70.
I said, I would have waited nine days for the part!!! He said "Too late now, you already paid for this new ice machine and the bill is closed."
He even gave me the old ice machine and said:"This ice machine works perfectly' you should save it" (I could not make this stuff up!!!)
I am still mad!!!
I tried calling customer service. First person I spoke to that day was very sympathetic and told me to call back the next day after he submitted the report. He was very encouraging and indicated that I might get some sort of a refund. He understood my complaint and agreed that there was something wrong with this whole service call.
The next day I called back I spoke to a rep who kept referring to my refrigerator as a washing machine, and he had very weak English language skills. I tried talking to him for a long time, he made no sense and it was a waste of half hour. He was talking nonsense.
I may try to call back today, as I am still upset about the service I received.< /text><GmapID>0x80e83abce6fc5769:0xe27dc5819b833081< /GmapID><UserId.>111375596597907778165< /UserId.><date>1500648072151<//date>< Rate>

Our repairman arrived on time and went straight to work on general maintenance on our washer and dryer.  Excellent service and was done in 30 minutes.  He replaced a pump in our washer and ordered a small part for the detergent tray.  Thank goodness we've kept our warranty!  It's worth every dime.  We had no charge.  You really can't get better service anywhere but with Sears.<//Review>

I had to wait one week for service as the tech for LG products only works this area on Thurs. and Fridays.  I have a care home for 6 seniors  and could not be without a refrigerator for 1 week.  (I have a freezer in the garage but no fridge, so I had to rent a refrigerator at a cost of $397.12.  Evidently the LG fridges are only serviced by LG and you cannot find service elsewhere.  Had I known this, I would never have purchased the LG brand.  Although I bought a service contract and it covered the repair, I am still out almost $400.

The service technician when he arrived was very pleasant and professional.  He deserves a 5-star rating.

Needless to say, I am still upset over the inconvenience and cost put out.</text>

We are VERY Disappointed with the  Service Repair as we had to have the Compressor changed out on our 2 year-old refrigerator.  We not only had to wait 3 weeks for the first diagnosis, but than we had to wait for the parts to be shipped to us.
Once the parts were installed we were expecting the refrigerator to cool down to its proper temperature, but that never happened.  The repair DID NOT FIX the problem and we still have food not being held at the proper temperature.
We called for another Service Appointment, but the next soonest appointment is a week away.
So we have to go a month without a refrigerator and that is totally unacceptable.
Needles to say we are very disappointed and frustrated about this whole episode.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Robert was amazing, my virtually brand new 1,800$ dryer decided to stop working the night I moved. I called Sears regarding my warranty and as always they dispatched a repair man to me immediately no questions asked. They do not try to find a way to get out of honoring the warranty, they  stand behind their master protection agreement. I was not paid or in any way compensated to write this review. I just wanted to express my appreciation for Sears and Robert helping me out in a pinch.< /text>< Pics>

<rating>1< /rating><text>The technician arrived during the correct time frame.  That is the ONLY positive comment I can make.  He stated the reason the dishwasher was taking so long to complete a normal cycle was because the water heater wasn't set high enough.  I didn't think that was the problem because we have plenty of hot water in the kitchen.  He turned the water heater to the highest setting.  He told me to wait 5 hours and run the dishwasher empty.  If that didn't solve the problem he said he would be back to replace a part. I waited 12 hours and ran the dishwasher empty like he said to do.  The cycle took 5 hours.  When I called A F Services the next day the technician said he didn't tell me that he said he would be back to replace a part. So they were paid by Sear's for doing NOTHING!!  They will NEVER come in my house again.  I don't need liars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80e83abce6fc5769:0xe27dc5819b833081</gmap_id></record>

This was my fourth repairman for my ice cube motor problem .During my first call he replaced the ice cube motor as it had stopped making ice. The second repair man said I had to live with it making terrible knocking sounds. The third man that came out confirmed I had a problem, but he doesn't do repairs?????????? The machine was making awful knocking sounds, as if someone wanted to get out of the refrigerator.

Finally, when I called this last time, as I spoke to the lady on the line, the refrigerator made the awful riveting noise.Plus it had stopped making ice cubes again. She couldn't believe the horrible noises coming from the machine. She finally made an appointment to have the service tech come out again. The appointment was for the following Tues. between 8:00 am
and 12:00 noon.
The day arrives and I'm up and ready for the tech. At 11:30 am I still hadn't seen him. I went on line and found they had changed the appointment to 1:45 - 3:45 pm. No one called me to tell me that, and I had wasted all those hours in the morning and now the afternoon. I was sooooo angry, When he finally came, he heard the awful noise and replaced the motor again.
It is working at the moment. But......if it happens one more time you can take your refrigerator back. I have now had four service calls and three ice cube motors replaced.  I am not feeling good about Sears right now. I have always used your products and had confidence in them. Not so at the moment. I'd be happy to speak with anyone in Customer service should you want to keep me as a customer.</text>

Sears repairman that worked on our washing machine was a true expert in every sense.  We needed a new pump, he located our brand at the nearest distributor, picked it up, returned immediately and installed with no problem.  He was efficient and professional; and we are very happy with the experience.</review>

Since I have a maintenance agreement on my 14 year old dryer, I called for service when its door handle broke.  The person who answered the phone said she ordered a replacement handle and that it would be here in a few days and scheduled a service person to install it.  When service person called the day that had been scheduled, the handle had not arrived.  Though, she said she had a handle on her truck.  She arrived during the scheduled time period and fairly quickly installed the new handle from her truck.  And, she indicated, she could not find any record of the other handle ever having being ordered.  Bottom line is service from person who answered phone call for service was fair while that provided by the person who came to our home was great.< /review>

Still not fixed, under warranty we ordered and Sears sent wrong size new one, simply dropped off, no installation. Installer came and said too big for our space. I specifically asked for an ada 32" height and they sent a 35".Had to wait another week for them to pick up wrong one, now have to order another one, and pray that the salesperson knows the sizes. Online they are misleading.</Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1518803473050, 'text': "Beautiful! We're glad we took care of your dryer.

The dishwasher repair was for my rental property but the time taken to have a repair
person there was unsatisfactory'.
First issue was that the wrong part was ordered and so needed to be reordered.  That issue put the actual repair out to two more weeks of waiting for the repair man.
Now I am being asked to renew my appliance repair contracts with Sears and I don't think I will.
I have one range and hood, two dishwashers, two refrigerators, and a washing machine between my rental property and home.  When something goes wrong with
them I need help now, not a month later which was the time it took to repair the
dishwasher in my rental.  That is not satisfactory for my tenant or myself. I am sure I could have had the repair done within a week with another local appliance repair
company.< /Review>

I received service on my microwave oven from JCE Repair of Oxnard, CA.  They were prompt, efficient and absolutely thorough in their work,  which required replacement of a part which had to be ordered.  The work required removal of the microwave from above the stovetop and meticulous inspection of the problem part, installation, test and replacing the microwave oven above the stove.  I could not have been more pleased with the work done and the manner in which it was performed...not an easy task by all means.  I would recommend the services of JCE Repair to anyone for any appliance repair.<//text>

<text>The repair of our refrigerator was the biggest rip off I have ever experienced in my 75 years of life.  It was $100.00 for them just to come out and look.  I told the repair man that motor was running most of the time and that my electric bill had gone way up..  The repair man said he knew the problem right away.  He said that the washer on the freezer door and the washer on the refrigerator door were reversed.  He switched the washers and everything worked like it should.  He then charged me and additional $120.00 for something that was installed wrong in the first place.  His comment is this what our time study chart says and therefore pay up.

I then called Sear's repair supervisor with no constructive comments other than what it is , it is...  I then tried going higher within Sears leaving messages on 2 different phones describing m,y situation.  A week later a secretary of one manager called, I explained my thoughts and she said she would pass it on.  I've heard nothing since.

The service technician was very professional.  He diagnosed the problem, explained the costs and showed me the damaged part. After completing the task my dishwasher was still making a loud noise. He thought it might be the motor but before proceeding to put in a new motor he went back in to make sure that something else was causing the problem and he found a very small broken piece that came off the broken part and that was what was still making noise.  It could have cost me a lot more but he was honest which is sometimes not the case with other repair companies!  I will continue to use Sears Appliance Repair and highly recommend them to others!< /Review>

<Text>The service technician was very professional.  He diagnosed the problem, explained the costs and showed me the damaged part. After completing the task my dishwasher was still making a loud noise. He thought it might be the motor but before proceeding to put in a new motor he went back in to make sure that something else was causing the problem and he found a very small broken piece that came off the broken part and that was what was still making noise.  It could have cost me a lot more but he was honest which is sometimes not the case with other repair companies!  I will continue to use Sears Appliance Repair and highly recommend them to others!< /Text></record>

< Review>
A super guy came and replaced the faulty ice maker.  He explained why it was leaking ( bad water) and what to do to prevent it from happening again (put a water filter in a nearby cabinet to filter the water before it gets to the refrig).   I had been fighting with ice build up for months, and if I had known how easy it is to get Sears to fix it I would have done it ages ago!  Thank you, Sears refrig repair man!</Review>

Was not there, but seemed to do what was needed. The one thing i was concerned with that was not addressed was...i set it at 71 in the am and by 2pm its 77 and up in the house.  So not sure if the unit that was sold to us by Sears was too small or what, cause it runs non-stop and it still gets hot!< /review>

Kevin was told the Sears man would come back when he got the part, BUT we have not heard back from the Sears repair me.  And, if the part is supposed to come in the mail - it STILL hasn't  arrived.  ??? STILL WAITING TO GET OUR STOVE DRAWER FIXED.

It took 5 weeks for Sears to repair my refrigerator. They were a no show for one appointment.  Their next available appointment was two weeks out.  When you call customer service, you are dealing with overseas operators who attempt to speak English.< /Text>

After looking on line the problem could very well be one of the fans or even freon.  Had to make a second appoint to get to the bottom of the true problem.</Review>< UserId.>

Open daily with a food truck so you can dine in during covid. Food must be purchased with the drinks. All outdoor seating that is "socially distant" and good brews. Come on in!<//text>

<text>Everything a small brewery should be (insert "AND MORE!" here). Friendly and helpful staff and regulars alike, inventive beers with consistently high quality, lots of games, spacious and open decor, and an outside area. No food but you can bring in whatever you'd like, or even have something delivered. Spot is on point. Peep it out if you haven't already!</text>< Rate>

There is no bad selection here. A very laid back atmosphere, friendly staff and excellent brews. If I lived closer I would be here every day for my daily happy hour.<//Review>

<review>I love we can pick up beer here especially during the pandemic times, they accommodated me when they didn't have exactly what I wanted and the bar tender was super friendly and helpful! I like this spot cuz I like the kind of beers more (more darker and ales) than the Arrow Brewery around the corner which has more sour beers and pale ales I don't like much which is why I come here more and support! ♡<//review>< Pictures>

I love Alosta Brewing.  I first found out about them when I was a volunteer serving their beer at my church’s annual festival.  I am now a regular and even joined their “mug club” this year.  My wife and I, along with our friends, are semi-regulars for trivia night on Thursday’s.  Fun place, great atmosphere.<//Text>

Located in a business park like many other breweries it is a nice setting. There is both indoor and outdoor seating and plenty of room. The staff were helpful and the beers were pretty good. they do not serve food but have food trucks come in frequently. prices were a little bit above average seven or eight dollars for most beers.< /text>

It's the type of business you'd want to go to.

The people are friendly and the beer is great! It's not too loud even on busy days. Definitely worth joining the Mug Club Membership (bigger mug that fits more beer).<//Review>

Herb has a wide palate and an even hand with the ingredients he uses. Many differing styles, all well made. The tasting room is a wide open and friendly space. You could spend hours here going through the inventory and be able to walk away from it. You'd need a DD, to be safe, but not by much.<//text>

Here's a quick reference of what they have
- Great beer
- board games
- tons of room (for larger groups)
- an outside area
- food trucks on the weekends
So if that sounds good try it out</Review>

Beer. If you're into friends and beer, not into food or atmosphere, this is your local hangout. Not pretentious, come as you are. Grab a glass; tasters on the pricey side.</Review>

Been there a few times. The beer is okay. Their Porter was probably the one I like the most. Atmosphere was a bit boring compared to other breweries I have been to. I have not been there in a while, so I am sure they have improved.</Review>

<Text>Great place to be, greatest people to be around. Interesting and innovative crafts coming out of Covina CA. Has trivia, food trucks and games. I especially recommend trying their sours, some of which truly rank top in my all time list of must-have beers. I especially like that they don't use cheap shortcuts to get taste. They actually brew intelligently to get the flavors they want in their beer. Always love a place that brews without gimmicks. Can't wait to see what new things they roll out for the coming year. (Try their blueberry sour- if you can get it. I'd fist fight a nun in the parking lot for a drop.)

Update: a, new beer out of Alosta to recommend, one of the more interesting I've had out of the Azusa/Covina area lately, Amarillo Wild. Its a mild sour, sweet but tart, floral and refreshing, enough sugar that you can drink 2 or 3 but exemplary balance. If you like sours or beers that are light on the palate, absolutely a must-try.<//Text>< userid>

<review>My family and I was in town visiting from Alabama. My brother, who lives here took us here for dinner. OMG, the food and atmosphere was Amazing. The live dj was the icing on the cake. We are from the south, so we love music and good food. I will definitely be back when we visit again.</review>< pictures>

The best food ever and dinner is 20 bucks for all you can eat. Can't beat that! The alcoholic beverages are always made with care, as well. Only negative during COVID is that you do not watch them cook your food at the stove. Instead, they bring your food to your table but you still get to add any ingredients you want. This place is a must if you're in the area :)< /Review>

Fresh and unlimited amounts of food!!! Great prices and friendly and quick service!

I only put 4 stars because the restrooms weren’t in the best shape! Would like to go again to try to experiment with more flavors!< /review>

<text>Terrible place I made a reservation and when I got to the place the place was closed.

<rating>4< /rating><text>Very clean. Fun experience. If you don't like the food, it's really your own fault since you put the bowl together yourself before they cook it. Came here for lunch on a Friday and was seated right away and had a very attentive server. I was a little surprised that they didn't have shrimp as a protein option, but that was of little consequence as we still left full from a good meal.<//text>< pictures>

Very cool place with really cool staff and great food. You build your own bowl to cook. You can do pretty much whatever you want. Burger, cheese steaks, meat bowls, with whatever sauces. It's really great. I highly recommend it.< /text>

Our family loves this place. There's so many items to choose from that everyone in my family can build something they enjoy to eat. The cooks are friendly and they do a great job cooking and presenting the ingredients you bring to them. I didn't catch the name of my favorite cook but he said he has been with them since restaurant opening. Front of house and waiters are all friendly and tentative. We had Raul and I always enjoy him being our server. I like how they provide disposable gloves to keep all tongs clean and safe for everyone. This month they had kids eat free and with that it fit our budget to keep coming back almost every weekend.<//text>

The food and drinks however were pretty good. My first time here was on my 21st birthday. Hostess took our number down we figured to let us know that a table was ready. Waited a pretty nice chunk of time, 30 minutes before closing we found out we could have walked in at any point to get a table. Ended up rushing to get food and didn't get to enjoy my birthday at all. Maybe another day in the far future I'll give this place another shot.< /Review><Date>1606035855481<//Date><GmapID>0x80dcd7c31e793301:0x50dd0e8b33f0efbf<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great for brunch! Also a good place if you are on the keto diet. Load up on bacon and eggs! If you are into carbs they have pancakes and french toast. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options too. If you have a group of people with different dietary needs, come here!< /Review>

This place is super fun my family always loves to go here. My kids especially love it. We take them on their birthdays and they make sure that they get sung to and they make big flames and you should see their faces. You can get as creative with what you make and they have all kinds of food. Starting with meat to veggies to salads to tacos and much more. The guys who tend to the big cooking area they’re all very friendly they’ve always pad great conversations with us and made us feel welcome. They’re really good at singing. The wait staff is always attentive the manager is always on point the place is located in Anaheim across from Disneyland so I’m sure he can get busy but we’ve never been where it has taken more than five minutes to get seated highly recommend</Text>

<Review>Great place that can feed you no matter what kind of cuisine you're craving. Personally, I went with a more Asian-inspired dish, but others in my party tried the hamburger or an Italian dish. No one left unhappy. I was definitely not unhappy.

My only concern is that my wife (who was not with me) could not have eaten there as I did not see a wok in use for people with allergies. I'd recommend that minor adaptation for them in the future if they're not already in use so they don't rely entirely on having cleaned the grill enough to not prompt a reaction.<//Review>< pics>

So many different combinations of meals to make. Service was great and seating was very quick.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhfn5g_YLFH-1xvZnsQoG5Y7Gvtj12SyuuOfTo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

Service was pretty bad. The food and drinks however were pretty good. My first time here was on my 21st birthday. Hostess took our number down we figured to let us know that a table was ready. Waited a pretty nice chunk of time, 30 minutes before closing we found out we could have walked in at any point to get a table. Ended up rushing to get food and didn't get to enjoy my birthday at all. Maybe another day in the far future I'll give this place another shot.</review>

It's beautifully decorated, it looks very upscale, however, we only did appetizers, as $19.95 is a bit steep of a price for Korean BBQ that you can get at the mall for over half the price.< /Review>

Had dinner there on a few occasions when we have travelled to the US from Australia to take the family to Disneyland

Great quality food with exceptional value for money. Shame it is so far away otherwise we would be back more often. Staff were great and the service was awesome

<Review>This place is so fun, but no relation to Game of Thrones! Located on the top floor of a shopping mall it's fairly easy to find. you have to park in the garage but as the plaza was empty it was easy.
There were just a few other groups dining here so not wait at all. We were seated and ordered drinks. Then you go to the bar where you build your own meal. They have everything from pasta to Chow Mein to the most amazing burger. I made a teriyaki noodle bowl which for my first time was alright but now I know better.
You build the uncooked meal in a bowl and then take it to the chef in the middle. It's like hibachi almost. He cooks it all right there in front of you. Or you can hit the salad bar. I could tell that wasn't touched as most of it was still stocked while the food bar was running low.
You also can ask the chef for a burger right there. This place is awesome. During lunch it's all you can eat for about $15. There's also a fully stocked bar and you can order desserts. If you're hungry, this is the place!< /Review>< Pics>

Fire and Ice is a great dining experience!  YOU select the fresh items that you want stir fried.  Choices galore include, pastas, veggies,  meats, sauces and spices.  If your children would rather have a hamburger or hot dog, no problem.  They have those in the meat section and will cook those on the grill too.  Appetite?  Yes, you can go back for seconds or thirds.  Additionally, there is soup, salad items and fruit.  Weekend includes pancakes and eggs.  Call for timeframes for breakfast items.   To top it off, the staff is friendly and really go the extra mile.  You won't be disappointed.   We love it!!!!<//text>

Fire & Ice isn’t just a grill but an interactive dining experience! The food gets cooked hibachi style right in front of you which keeps everyone entertained while they wait for dinner to be served. The food and drinks are all very good, and the staff is great to interact with, as you would expect them to be in an atmosphere like this. I’ve sampled a good portion of the menu now, and I can honestly say everything I’ve tried has been delicious.</text>

I think Melissa is the one who served me.  She’s a great server.  The price is decent, not over the top and the meal (the burger) was just right.  I even had the brownie with ice cream.  Ok I’m full just thinking about it!!

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Took our office staff there for lunch today.  After being seated you go through a salad bar line.  Then you go through another line with a wide variety of meats and vegetables.

You pack whatever you want into a bowl, then bring it to a large flatiron grill in the middle of the room.  It's kind of like a Mongolian BBQ.  You stand around the grill while the cooks work their magic.  Then it's back to the table to enjoy.

The food was surprisingly good, but the service was sliw.  We had to flag down our waitress a few times during the meal.  It was a fun experience.  I would go back again.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Excellent cooked too order all you can eat. Choose all of your raw ingredients. Choose from a variety of Asian sauces, or Italian sauces, or Mexican sauces. Hand everything to the chef, and watch him cook your masterpiece.

Asian style... I recommend starting with a half container of either Szechuan or Sesame sauce, then experiment by filling up the rest of the container with some other sauces. If you really want to play it safe, just do equal parts Szechuan and Sesame sauce.

Italian style... I recommend equal parts Alfredo and Pesto. Add a garlic butter ball to your main bowl containing your noodles. Also add some raw garlic, and if you like it spicy, add some Sambal crushed red chillies to you're main bowl. Finally sprinkle some Sicilian seasoning over everything and hand it to the chef. Ask the chef to mix some of his own supply of shredded Parmesan to it while it cooks!

Mexican style... I recommend 2 parts Fajita sauce, and 1 part Cilantro Lime sauce. If you want to get crazy, add a garlic butter ball to your main dish containing your meats and veggies. Tell your waiter you'd like some tortillas and sour cream, and he'll bring them to your table.

Happy hour until 7pm! $4 beers!< /Review>

Food on the grill is my favorite there.. u get to make your own options of what you wat to eat from seafood to beef soup and salad. Plus you get to watch them cook it all up for u. The cocktails are great also. Price is great for all you get with the grill. It unlimited eating for $20. Not bad i think<//Text>

Fire and Ice is a great dining experience!  YOU select the fresh items that you want stir fried.  Choices galore include, pastas, veggies,  meats, sauces and spices.  If your children would rather have a hamburger or hot dog, no problem.  They have those in the meat section and will cook those on the grill too.  Appetite?  Yes, you can go back for seconds or thirds.  Additionally, there is soup, salad items and fruit.  Weekend includes pancakes and eggs.  Call for timeframes for breakfast items.   To top it off, the staff is friendly and really go the extra mile.  You won't be disappointed.   We love it!!!!</review>

Great place with tons of options for every diet! Sign up for their email list to get some smoking deals! It's a clean, fun and tasty all you can eat Mongolian BBQ restaurant. Pick a base like veggies, pasta or rice then add toppings like carrots, tofu, corn, pineapple almost anything! Then choose a protein (or two... Or three!) In the evenings they have more seafood and serloin steak but lunch offers many options like crab, chicked, shreaded beef, cod etc. Then add some sauces (mix them together for more options!) And have them cook it together! You can also make custom orders like hot dogs, hamburgers and Philly cheese steak! The options are limitless! If your visiting the Disneyland area you need to check this place out!</text>

It was my first time there. Did not know it was an all you can eat buffet. Even though the food was very good, I didn't eat all I could because of a late breakfast 😋. I will be back and ready to throw down. 🤫😋<//Text>

What a fun place! Plus great service. Our server Melissa was really attentive. We never had to ask for anything...we turned around and dishes removed, drinks refilled. The host (dont know his name) helped my friend whose daughter needed ice on her eyes (from a pool incident earlier in the day). He offered an ice pack (after seeing her put cucumbers on her eyes) without prompting. Plus the gentlemen at the bbq were entertaining, professional, and efficient. Everything moved quickly...food completely cooked, and fun to waThey seemed to have addressed the signage - it was clear we should put sauce on the side - signage at the ingredient bar and the server also told us. Fun, touristy place with a nice rooftop seating area and firepit. Would definitely recommend to visitors at the Disneyland area and would come again!< /text>

It's busy on Saturday night, not so much on Friday night. We went last night on Fri and they closed early at 10 because they were slow. So went back tonight and there was a pretty long wait for the grill. Food was good though, price is good, and they have some good beers on tap!</Text>

One night I went here to do recon for a friend of mine.  His girl was out with a group of people and he just wanted to know if everything was on the up and up!  Well maybe she was or wasn’t, but I ended up ordering an entire meal including a chocolate Sunday, Fries, bacon burger and a beer!  I will do recon here every day if I need too!<//Review>

I've been here a couple times when visiting California, and i still absolutely love this place. I made some dang good seafood pasta. My only complaints are:
1. Suggested dish builds would be a great idea for people who don't know what to put together (my husband struggled with what to make)
2. At my favorite Mongolian bar in Utah, you put a stick with a number in your dish and they give you that number to put on your table and bring the food to you when it's cooked. I went as a nice date with my husband for our honeymoon, but we didn't actually get to sit and eat together the whole time. It was busy, but I can't imagine it's the busiest they get... And I had to wait forever for my food to cook and when I got back down he made his and by the time he got back I was ready to get more, and it kept going like that.
3. Trays would be amazing. They kept moving me around the cooking table and the sauces were spilling all over my hands cause I couldn't carry everything. I know it's more cleanup, but my hands could have been less messy if it had been an option. (if it normally is, I couldn't find them)<//review>

I have been coming here for the last 5 years and I've always had a great experience. The food is fantastic and the quality of service is amazing. I have been served by the manager Raul and he always provides the best customer service and makes me feel beyond welcome. I highly recommend this place. The staff including the chiefs are wonderful and the area is very nice for a family dinner or a romantic date.<//Review>

The manager Raul is always on top of everyone making sure every customer is satisfied. I do have to admit I don’t really like change but PLEASE bring back the Parmesan and oil dressing as ridiculous as it sounds it’s also one of the main reasons I come is to have a tasty salad.</review>< rate>

< review>
Came in with a party of 9. We arrived at 8:03. The host up front and male manager up front said "just so you guys know, we close at 9" when the website said it closes at 10. We called ahead but walked from our hotel. Due to construction it took longer than anticipated. When we all seemed confused, the female host said, "well you guys said you would be here by 7:45 and you're late". I've never been treated so poorly. I'll never be back and I'll be contacting their corporate office. This manager and this particular host have no business running a restaurant or dealing with guests. Worst dining experience ever.<//review>

We celebrated my daughter' 13th and my niece's 25th birthdays at Fire and Ice.  We had a large party of 21.  Raul, our server was great.  He did an excellent job taking care of our large party.  He was very nice and pleasant.  Fire and Ice was very accommodating with our needs and the fire with the birthday song was awesome.  We'd definitely eat here again.<//text>

WOW!!! What a cool place. So many different foods you can eat here. Good price for all you can eat. My family really enjoyed putting all the different combinations together. The cooks really interact with you so your not just standing there while your food is being made. Left there full and satisfied</review>

They have great food and the chef's are always funny. The only way I can think of this not being a good place to eat would be if you didn't like mixing foods together. This is a great place for a date night, birthday, or just a nice dinner. I recommend you check it out.<//Review>

Really great date night spot. Fun drinks. Virgin options are available. The guys working the grill are the best, very fun, interactive, food came out just great. Waiters can get busy, but they are working hard. Maybe go at slow hours if you like more attentiveness. That being said, it is a buffet.< /Text>

< Review>
You can find great food anywhere however its about the experience! So i decided to give the experience and great food a try and we went in on Sunday and asked for Raul since he had a handful of positive reviews!

BEST dinning experience we have had in a long time!! Raul is so charismatic and outgoing with a great energy and passion. He recommended great drink options that had us trying a lot of drinks & great food!

I am planning a birthday dinner and i return only to Raul. His knowledge on the food & drinks will make it easy for my guests to decide on their dinning options since it will be their first time here. I Can’t wait to go through this dinning experience again and have great food with Raul!</Review>

First time here. Great variety of food to choose from and great taste if you pick the right sauce to go with your choices. The cooks are cool as can be very interactive place. And they take great care of you here. Lunch is $13 befor 3pm and 3pm and on $20. But well worth it. Give it a taste. 😊👍</text>

<text>Food was good. Service was non-existent. Had to track down my own server multiple times to get a drink. Took over an hour waiting for the check, and then we were over charged. I basically give 5 star reviews to anything that's even decent but I can't in good conscience recommend this place after the service we had.</text>< rating>

We have been coming to Fire & Ice for a couple of years now and their service and staff are always good and friendly. We came by yesterday Sunday and Raul went above and beyond to recognize us as regular guests. He always greets us with a smile and recognizes us everytime we come. Raul and the rest of the staff are always attentive of us and has us coming for more. Definitely recommend this place to anyone!< /text>

<Text>This is a unique way to craft your meal. Grab a bowl and throw in a range of ingredients from pasta to vegetables to meat. You pick a sauce and take everything to a grill. After grilling you have your meal. There is some guesswork involved but the food was good.</Text>< pics>

<user_id>108673381743760249131< /user_id><Review>Love this place. You get to make your own dishes and they cook for you. If you haven't been before the first time can be a little overwhelming if you aren't used to cooking,  like me. However,  I've grown to love this place because I can try my hand and putting together items I like. My "creations" aren't always the best which is why I like to make them small and go larger when I figure out what tastes good together. Of course,  if you have a good cook in your group they can help you figure out what goes well with each other. Today,  I was surprised they have brunch on the weekends.  My omelet was amazing!! This place is great for a couple,  family,  or even large gatherings.</Review></record>

We love Fire and Ice! We love the food we can make, the atmosphere, and most of all the service!  Raul (General Manager) is always so welcoming and attentive when we come and Kevin (Grill Cook) always cooks our food to perfection toon and keeps us laughing while we wait! We never get sick of coming here. Definitely recommend this place if you’re nearby and hungry!</text>

Best meal I've had in LA so far. It hard to get good Asian food. This is fresh and you know exactly what goes into it because you choose every ingredient. Which then someone else cooks to perfection.</review>

< review>
Ever encountered someone that plays hard to get? You do all this chasing, unsure if it's even worth your time & effort. I saw Fire and Rice multiple times on my social media feed looking all delicious without having a clue if I'd ever get a chance to try it.

To my surprise, Fire and Rice made an appearance at the Taylor Street Night Market in Downtown San Jose. I waited in line for quite some time, eager to try the Fried Spam Musubi. As soon as I was next in line to order, they ran out of Fried Spam Musubis-- I won't lie, that one hurt deep personally.

I went with the Spam & Egg musubi instead and it didn't disappoint! She was worth the chase although she must want me to keep chasing her for her Fried Spam Musubi (I suppose she's gotta leave some good things for me to wonder about for me so that I look forward to a second date)

My friend said the difference between the Fried Musubi and Spam & Egg musubi is that of course the Fried version is a lot crunchier, while the Spam & Egg version carries a lot more of the Spam flavor complimented by the egg.

Want to join the chase?
Go to their website & click on 'Schedule'. That's where they let everyone know where they're heading next.</review>

I normally don't like to write reviews, but I had to leave one for Raul!  Upon entering he welcomed me and my family immediately and provided nothing less then excellent customer service!  If there were ten stars to give, I would've because 5 stars is an understatement for his urgency and natural ability to make people feel happy while dining in.  He would come to our table and make sure everything was going well, provided refills, and kept giving us tips on to make the food taste better!  I will definitely come back after visiting Disneyland in the near future!  EVERYONE ASK FOR RAUL, and you will have a great experience.</text>

Very good food. Large amount of variety. Good service. Our group had no complaints with this restaurant. This has definitely become one of my top five restaurants to visit in all of Orange County. I came back  two years after my initial review and the quality is still great. I wish I came back sooner.<//Review>

<Review>Great concept for a restaurant. The Mongolian Grill twist on all-you-can-eat means everyone gets exactly what they want. Having the cooks make up your dish in front of you means a bit of a wait, but it also means you aren’t pulling soggy food out of a warming tray, like you get at other buffets. Definitely recommend it to anyone in the Disney parks area!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcd7c31e793301:0x50dd0e8b33f0efbf< /GmapID></record>

Service ended up being just "ok" nothing special. Staff was not what it usually is, which makes me wonder if its because the Manager Raul wasn't there? He does seem to always be on top of everything when im there. Definitely not the same experience we are used to when Raul is there. From now on i will only go when he is there to get outstanding service and keep everyone motivated!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I didn't know it was a buffet and was pleasantly surprised. I had a stir fry concoction. The cook was nice and suggested sauces to go with what I created. My friends and I came in between breakfast and lunch. One of the cooks was nice enough to make me a crepe! Which was delicious by the way. Bonus, they have happy hour daily.

Friendly serves, nice location and I would definitely recommend this place to those visiting or local to the area.< /text><Time>1535100649965<//Time>< Rate>

One of my favorite Mongolian BBQ spots! A lot of healthy vegan/vegetarian options if you want that... And nice tasty meats if you don't!
The chefs are friendly and fun to watch!< /review>

Staff was very attentive and friendly, and the line for food was short as well. Tons of options for food choices, almost that it's overwhelming. There is both indoor and outdoor seating depending on your preference as well.< /Review>

We take my son here for his birthday every year, they do a great job of making people feel special. The food is delicious, you pick whatever you like and they cook it on the flat top in front of you. It's entertaining and the cooks are always very friendly and love talking to customers.</Text>

Love the place!  It's like a hiabachi(spelling?) without all the cool tricks, but it is like one guy cooking on a huge circular metal stove and he did like 8 orders at a time so i think that's a trick?<//text>

I used to visit the Providence, RI Fire + Ice years ago and the atmosphere was always so upbeat.  The music was always playing the cooks we're friendly and loved to dance around the grill.  This experience was nothing like that.  It was disappointing.  As for the food, it was okay.<//text>

<Text>Was in Anaheim for a conference. Went there 2 nights in 6 days because food was so good. Also a very fun place to eat as you get to create your own dish and they cook it on a big grill. I have been to Mongolian grill style places before but this one is top notch with way more selection than I have seen before.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80dcd7c31e793301:0x50dd0e8b33f0efbf<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

The fare was of quantity and satisfaction, not as much foodstuff available as they might want you to believe. Table and booth layout is a bit off as you're squeezing by everybody when establishment gets busier.  Would think that the desserts assortment be just that, not simply three items.<//Text>

We enjoy coming over to Fire and Ice. The staff is great courteous friendly and the manager Alex is an awesome manager. Always walking around to ensure that the clients are being taken care of.

The cooks put on a show that is worth watching. The food is also great and filling.< /review>

If u r not a specialist in cooking and know which spices and sauces go on which dish then don’t bother. For me I cook everyday but when I go to a restaurant I like to spoil myself not think how I should have my plate cooked and what seasoning should be added. Not my place nor recommend.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
This is your typical "Mongolian barbecue" restaurant - get your ingredients, bring them to the large grill and watch as your stir-fry is cooked.

What sets this place apart from other similar restaurants is that their ingredient selection is a bit more unique, and they can make a few different items on the grill that go beyond just stir-fry (they can do hamburgers and pizzas, and a few other things I think, as well).

I ordered what amounted to a Long Island from the bar, and it was very strong (and too bitter) - not tasty at all.

Overall, a good place. If you're a fan of restaurants of this nature (make-your-own stir-fry), I recommend this place.</Review>

Pricing is a little high especially considering this is an "all-you-can-eat" with a time limit!  Try it out, only if you are already at gardenwalk and hungry. Yet, there are a few better options in the front of the outdoor mall.<//Review>< pics>

Not at all what I was expecting. I was expecting a Mongolian grill, and ended up being more like a Vegas buffet cooked on a Mongolian style grill. Black beans, pinto beans, bow tie pasta, chipotle chicken, hot dogs, 6oz hamburger pattie, and calamari are not items I've experienced at a Mongolian bbq before. Food and service were good, just not what was expected.</review>

Lunch prices are unbeatable!  All you can eat and you get to build your own meals, what more can you ask for!  I usually come by and make a massive double patty burger (lettuce wrapped) with bacon and cheese.  It's a bummer that they don't offer a fried egg on top anymore as the eggs are saved for the weekends only now :(.  Nonetheless they still are my go to place on site (GardenWalk), when I want a nice hearty meal.< /Review>

The chefs are friendly and the food is based on what you can think up. They have protiens ranging from chicken, beef, and fish. Veggies and rice with noodles. Lunch is $12 while dinner is $20. They also validate parking.</Text>

<text>Was good food but the service was sub par by a lot in my opinion, I ordered water and took over 20 mins and a few reminders just to get it. As well as they forced me to pay 18% gratuity and couldn't split a check more than 4ways.< /text>< pics>

A great concept but often a challenging execution. No clear directions from waitstaff and management was at times unresponsive to questions or concerns as they arose. Our party kept getting moved around and when we complained to management, he did not seem to think this was an issue.</Review>

Now when I go Thursdays. Melissa the server and host with a goe tee do a very good job. A great job. The two people that work Thursdays in the day that open the restaurant in the day are the best.

<Text>Cool concept of having the flat top and choosing your own ingredients. However, the execution of this process falls short.
It simply takes too long. I'd rather go back to my table and sip on a glass of wine instead of waiting 15 minutes for the guy to cook everyone's stuff who is ahead of my in line.
Also, why is an egg not an available ingredient? I'd like to have fried rice with a little egg in it. Is that too much to ask?<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Always a fun place to eat. The chefs at the grill are a blast to watch and the food is good. It can be a little overwhelming to choose what to fill your bowl with! At times, Fire + Ice is very busy and the line gets very long for food.<//text>< date>

I love going there, but a host called Alejandro is a horrible, horrible host. Very bad at his job. He made my mom and I very uncomfortable and a latina server is very horrible too. Now when I go Thursdays. Melissa the server and host with a goe tee do a very good job. A great job. The two people that work Thursdays in the day that open the restaurant in the day are the best. They treat us like family.< /review>

Came here because of how great the reviews were. Unfortunately my food was cold and I felt sick after eating here. The staff was nice and the calamari that we ordered was great. The buffet style food options was slim.< /review>

Very little selection.  Cooks are young boys who just throw everything on the grill at the same time.  Noodles are still tough and cold, and beef is waaay overcooked.  This would be a fun place for kids to hang out.  If you enjoy food, go somewhere else.<//review>

Pro: the appetizers were quite filling good thing when you are enjoying cocktails.
Cons: cocktails are sub standard, long Island taste like lemonade sent it back, lava flow  just sweet. Server was busy on her phone, had to ask hostess to bring our waters. Won't come back here. Poor customer service<//review>

Food was ok.  Since you choose your own sauce, vegetables and meat, it’s really up to your skills to make it good.  Fun to watch them make Mongolian stirred fires, but only for a few minutes</Text>

<Text>It is a fun environment good for groups but just know if you have a party of 6 or more they automatically charge a 18% gratuity to the bill even if you have a bill separate from your group because they still consider all of you together. Thats the only thing I didn't like.The line for the grill moved rather quickly to say it was a Saturday night. The DJ was great. I would recommend this place to other's.<//Text>< pics>

Great variety of food and entertaining experience. Awesome staff! Only complaint is the way they cook the food. This NOT for folks with diatery restrictions ..... Not for a vegetarian for sure. Bacon fat and meet cross contaminating everything, and they use the same spatla for all foods.<//text>

We went here after an entire day at California Adventure. It never felt so good to sit down. I have been to a lot of Mongolian restaurants and this one was a little odd because it also had stuff to make like Italian pasta. They had a really good variety of options to add to your food and they had a lot of sauces but they were all like pre mixed sauces. I prefer the Mongolian grills that allow you to mix your own amount of teriyaki sauce, garlic, sherry, ginger, sesame oil etc. Our cook was very friendly... super chatty with the people in line to the point that he kinda seemed to forget about our food and my boyfriend’s steak got a little over cooked.</Text>

<review>Wait times at Fire + Ice can get crazy, so come early. You can't go wrong with the Mongolian grill experience; I mean literally, if you don't like the food you selected who's fault is it?

Service here at the Anaheim location is superb, our hostess, Evette, was extremely attentive (and definitely on the Unicorn side of the Hot/Crazy Matrix). She brought out bread and tortillas and was very fast with my drink order.

The selection of food choices is endless and incredible, with crab, steak, and just about every meat you can imagine. I had shaved steak with Mango Habanero sauce (of a dozen to choose from). Also had a small salad and a cup of chicken noodle soup (perfect portion).

We didn't stay for dessert, since the bowling alley was next on our list and we traditionally have dessert there.

We will definitely be back. Remember, come early. We arrived at 4:30, no wait.< /review><UserId.>108806414935649540369< /UserId.><username>Steve Wiideman< /username><rating>5</rating><response>None< /response><time>1494116247881<//time><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

This is a place where bringing family or a date it's a win win, from the unique way the food was prepared, displayed and served.

<text>Oddest place ever. Drinks came out wrong (this was all we ordered before a show at HoB). Employees sit and eat in the bar while on shift. I saw employees eating non stop.

< review>
We went here after an entire day at California Adventure. It never felt so good to sit down. I have been to a lot of Mongolian restaurants and this one was a little odd because it also had stuff to make like Italian pasta. They had a really good variety of options to add to your food and they had a lot of sauces but they were all like pre mixed sauces. I prefer the Mongolian grills that allow you to mix your own amount of teriyaki sauce, garlic, sherry, ginger, sesame oil etc. Our cook was very friendly... super chatty with the people in line to the point that he kinda seemed to forget about our food and my boyfriend’s steak got a little over cooked.</review>

<text>Way too loud, food did not look fresh just sitting there. The idea of this place is way better than the execution. Cheap food labels and "cheap" atmosphere caused us to leave and go to Cheesecake Factory around the corner. Also be warned that GPS may not guide you to the parking garage. That was a bit strange.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Largest selection of books I've ever seen in one store. I love the variety they have --they have both new and used, 50 cent pulp to 50$ rarities. It is well organized and the staff is helpful.< /Review>

Traveled from Phx, AZ with my boyfriend to go to Disneyland - I was super excited to try Fire and Ice! I had one plate and couldn't finish it because it made me feel sick. We are supposed to be going to Disneyland today, but I was in the bathroom puking for most of the night... so I'm super disappointed. Wish we chose a different restaurant so this trip could go as planned.< /Review>

Traveled from Phx, AZ with my boyfriend to go to Disneyland - I was super excited to try Fire and Ice! I had one plate and couldn't finish it because it made me feel sick. We are supposed to be going to Disneyland today, but I was in the bathroom puking for most of the night... so I'm super disappointed. Wish we chose a different restaurant so this trip could go as planned.<//review>

On the first day the food was very excellent but the next day same time time it wasn't as great. I guess the cooks changed and this was Tuesday and Wednesday. However the server was excellent and very accommodating.</Review>

This is my go to for pre-disney food.
Can get an all-you-can-eat mountain of healthy stir fry for a a fair price.  Perfect for getting a good amount of veggies and vitamins for a full day of day of disneyland.</Review>

Pretty cool place to watch your food cooked teppanyaki-ish and an all-you-can-eat too.  The service could have been a little better- the cooks looked a little tired and overworked, but overall enjoyed their cooking and style.

The food was okay quality, but when you consider the large variety of foods you can mix and create, the experience is pretty awesome.  The way the buffet works is you grab a bowl and place all the ingredients you want cooked (pastas, stir fry, fried rice, and burgers).  The pricing is also quite fair- $16 for Sunday Brunch Buffet (you also get some great pancakes and omelettes!)

Would come back.  Food and entertainment is a nice combo.<//text>

Walked in, service right off the bat was mediocre. Lady barely explained the procedure, however it was obvious, so we managed. She checked on us only once. Tables, menus, and walls were all dirty. Smudges and sticky. Just gross.  Assortments of meat and veggies was ok, sauces were too, but weird. Weird tasting. Just meh. Salad bar was pretty basic and that = boring. There was ONE soup and it was chicken noodle. Like who honestly cares about chicken noodle? Rolls were obviously old, previously frozen and could be used as shoes they were so tough.  Loud, unorganized atmosphere. Chefs were talking to friends or not at all, no showmanship. For 40 dollars it was just NOT worth it at all. Your money would be better spent at a nice place or a cheaper buffet! Really!<//text>

On the first day the food was very excellent but the next day same time time it wasn't as great. I guess the cooks changed and this was Tuesday and Wednesday. However the server was excellent and very accommodating.</text>

Food tasted good but my entire family had stomach aches afterwards. Also the music was very eco and depressing.  If you’re not ready to eat at least two meals of food then the $19 price tag is a bit much.< /Text>

Satisfying meal but the service was lackluster.  It's nice to be able to put together the exact items you want in your meal and it's all you can eat too so, it's a great value for what you get.<//Review>

This poem beats all poems I've ever experienced. At first, Frost hits you with fire, and he would be fine if the world ended in fire! Near the end, my man Frost hits you with ice being okay and would suffice. 10/10 must read.<//review>

Along with the typical grill items you can have hamburgers or hot dogs grilled to order with your choice of toppings.  The only minuses for me was limited beer selection and the only fish is tilapia, no stars deducted just a personal distain I have for that fish. I will dine here again while I'm in the Anaheim area.</Review>< pics>

Good food, good prices, and a great atmosphere with super friendly staff, and a nice parking structure, what more can you ask for?  Definitely try this place if you are local or just visiting.< /Text>

The food was good but service was terrible!  Our waiter messed up our orders and forgot to bring some of the order.  The waiter also charged us for food we never got.  Then when it was time to pay would couldnt find him and we He finally brought the bills they were all wrong.  We were in a hurry to leave and too him 20 mins to do 1 check.  I asked another employee if we could pay up front DH replied" That I will get the manager to come over and take care of your bills". He never showed. We were forgotten as customers. I do not recommend if your in a hurry or on a busy day because they can't handle big tables.</review>

Horrible customer service!We walked in and the wait was 45mins, so we waited roughly 60mins and by the time they called my party i was glad the wait was over and a staff member from here walked us to our table OUTSIDE where there was no one! Just my party of 3, we were confused like why hace us wait so long go sit us outside where it is 49 degrees OUTSIDE! Once the waiter got to our table to ask for our drinks my toes where numb from the windy cold weather, she smiled and said "im sure you guys want coffee" and we just said "yeah!" She said sorry but the wait on the coffee is 15mins... So ridiculous, like really!We couldn't deal with the COLD weather so we left. Dont go as a walk in this is a horrible customer service, they could've just asked us in the beginning if it was ok to sit outside or simply say " sorry we arent taking anymore walk ins"<//Review>

< Review>
I've been to Fire and Ice several times, on several occasions to celebrate various birthdays etc. We planned a dinner party at fire and ice for my sister's birthday and the food was great as always, but the service was appalling! I have never had such bad service and I've been to Fire and Ice many times. Our guests were embarrassed, the drinks were incorrect or salty, and our waitress NANCY was the worst. From the beginning of her introduction there was a horrible attitude towards the entire party. She approached our guests and did not give them time to look at the menu, but assumed they were not ordering and shared this info with guests at the other end of the table , by stating "are you going to order or are you going to sit down here like the other three on that end and not order?"....embarrassing (By the way, the other three ordered drinks and 1- ordered a meal)! Condescending, short in speaking with you etc. was how Nancy conducted herself! When asked twice to have someone come over to celebrate my sister's birthday, she forgot, and stated after being told twice,  that it is "our responsibility as customers to remind, and remind and remind her of this. " She then asked if it is still necessary since most of our guests are leaving......unbelievable! I was only aware of a small portion of this on last night at the party or I would have addressed this with the night me. We spent $500 plus 18% gratuity (we overpaid for service that was not delivered). She did NOT deserve the gratuity. Yet we paid....I called the restaurant today After finding these things out and still spoke with a mgr. With no real training on how to handle customer service issues....you don't cut someone off and say "I get it.. I get it, in mid conversation. She wasn't even listening to parts of the conversation, gave a half hearted apology claiming she apologized 10 times (who does that in REAL mgmt???)  And offered a free meal. Very disappointing. The goal here was to avoid this in the future, not request a FREE food item.
This company definitely could use training in customer service on ALL levels.  One of my favorite places failed and disappointed my sister and her guests on her 50th birthday.< /Review>

choose your carb (asian noodle, rice, pasta), vegetables, and then protein.  pick a sauce. then watch them cook it for you.  oh yeah, it's all you can eat! i'd suggest going weekday lunch if you can, it's about half the price.<//Text>

Why only one cook, Fire + Ice??

BIRTHDAY MONTH=BIRTHDAY COUPONS=HAPPY RODNEY

Free meal

One of the oldest tenants at Anaheim GardenWalk,  Fire + Ice is a Mongolian BBQ that has been on my to-try list for quite some time.  After stopping by KDOC in Santa Ana, Fire +Ice at the GardenWalk was a quick nearby lunch option.  And, having my free birthday month meal coupon in hand, it seemed like a plan.

The layout is simple enough.  Start by choosing your base (various noodles, rice, pasta etc.), then vegetables.  After that, comes the protein, sauces & prepared salads.  Pizza available at certain times, too!

Don't do what I did & mix the sauces with the meat.  Failing to heed the signs led the cook to inform me how mixing the two prior to cooking may led to the meat burning on the grill.

While there are a lot of options to eat, I found the choices of meat to be lacking in quality.  Initially excited to see blackened cod, the outcome after cooking proved to be rather dry & not very appetizing.  The shaved beef became a mush around the cod, and I found it hard to finish my plate.

Mussels & pork proved to be a step up in fare, leading to better enjoyment with my second plate.  I stuck to spring mix salad & Italian salad for my vegetables.

Service from my attendant was fine.  But, as I lamented to start the review, there's only one cook manning the grill!  I lucked out & just made the free 1 hour validated parking when leaving the GardenWalk.  Ample seating inside & al fresco.

Parking is at the Anaheim GardenWalk.  Validated parking is free for the first hour & reduced pricing for anything over.

A free meal is good, but the wait from having one cook, not to mention the lack thereof of quality meat options, are what soured my initial visit to Fire + Ice.  I'm glad I finally took the opportunity to check this place out, but unfortunately, I don't think I'll be using my free birthday month coupons going forward.  And, coming from a cheapskate like me, that's saying something!<//Review>

< Review>
Eh.....SKIP!! Quality of food is disappointing and the prices are too high for what its worth. +1 star for the good customer service.

Overall, the concept is interesting. They have AYCE Mongolian BBQ for $16.99 during dinner and $10.99 during lunch. There's a salad bar, a pasta bar, a topping/meat bar, and a sauce bar. You choose a pasta of your choice and top it with as many toppings that you can fit into a bowl and then you choose your sauce/seasonings on the side. Afterwards you wait in line next to the huge round grill located in the middle of the room and the chefs go to work cooking each person's dish.

Now the only problem with this concept is that the chefs at other Mongolian BBQ places usually mix the sauces for you but in this case there's at least 20 different types of sauces and seasonings and no instruction on the quantity or amount of sauce to use. Now if you are as clueless as I am with the variety of options then you are stuck eyeballing what to mix together and how much sauce to use and guess what? If your food ends up tasting terrible then its your own fault since you mixed it! I've tried two plates of food and the first noodle plate was terrible. The sauces I decided to use tasted funny and the udon noodles were the worse tasting noodles I've ever had. They were mushy, and stuck together in clumps. My second plate consists of only seafood since i didn't want to try my luck with the pastas anymore ( I picked clams, two different types of fish, and shrimp). Again, the seasoning didn't taste right and the clams were not fresh. Most of them were closed shut and those that were open tasted rotten. At this point I figured perhaps I was just having bad luck creating dishes that I thought would taste good so I had a taste of my date's concoction. Although his dish tasted way too bland and most of the meat and tofu were overcooked.

The only redeeming factor of this place is the good customer service. They consistently come by to refill water and check up on you to clear plates etc. I've always thought you can't go wrong with any type of Mongolian BBQ but sadly I was wrong. This place is pretty disappointing and I don't think I will ever be coming back especially since there's so many better options nearby (Cheesecake Factory, CPK, McCormick & Schmick's, Roy's).</Review>

< review>
Should I eat Fire + Ice? It depends what you are looking for in your meal. On paper this place sounds like a great concept. If you are hungry there are plenty of options.

The things I wish I knew:
1. You can make pizza, waffles, omelets, hot dogs, Philly Cheese steak, and hamburgers! There is a sign on the wall for pizza, but if you walk past it you will never know. I didn't know the grill area has bread. Only regulars know this, but I was too full to try any of these.

2. Less is more! Remember you can always come back. Don't overload your plate go for a dish with simple and less ingredients. I don't recommend mixing too many sauces. Stick to the basics. Focus on one meat or one sauce helps.

3. Don't forget your veggies! I didn't have this problem but I watched a lady fill a bowl with every possible meat. If you do this, you are going to have a BAD TIME. I hope she has fiber.

PROS:
1. Services is excellent! The chefs are very friendly and attentive. Thanks for the pointers, because I was a newbie and didn't know where the line started at the grilling area. The food area is always clean full stocked.

2. Options! The options are truly endless. If this were an ice cream joint, Pinkberry and Baskin Robins would have nothing on this place.

3. Birthdays and large groups! No problemo! Getting a table was great and having restaurant patrons singing Happy Birthday off key priceless. Too bad the staff didn't join in.

4. Great for kids and people of all ages. This place is casual enough, but still has the great lounge/party music and bar decor for a late night hangout.

5. The food is pretty good. I was starving and this place hit the spot.

CONS:
1. Raw food. I didn't have too much confidence looking at the raw meats. The meat is stored in the same fashion as the salad bar, in cylinder containers with some kinda of cooling underneath.. maybe ice? Have you ever gone to the groceries store meat section and you feel cold suddenly? No this area is not that cold so what gives? Most KBBQ and Mongolian BBQ place shave frozen meat or if the meat is not frozen at least the meat is in a refrigerated unit. I'm a bit concern about the safety of this meat.

2. Over-cooked. My greatest fear is handing a chef a piece of raw meat and getting charred beef jerky back. The cooking process happens in a semi-circle so on a busy day the cook will just go down the flipping the food as he walks around the grill. Bad idea! Seafood and pork takes way longer than beef. I always try to be last in line for the best results. The first person has to wait until the chef cycle by a few times then he takes your burnt fried rice off the grill.

3. You get what you put in. I find random experimentation results in rolling the dice on flavor. If you don't cook, how will you know what goes in the dish you are trying to make? It would be nice some pictures to look or a menu on the table that tells you what goes in a chicken Alfredo and what doesn't go on a pizza. It would be nice to have a master chef to answer questions and make dishes for you :).

Things that need improvement (or make this place much better):
1. Separate the salad. I messed up my first round at First and Ice. My fault for starting on the wrong end of the line.  I was about to make a salad and I was collecting the items then I almost put raw meat on my salad. Please have a raw food area only.

2. Pre-cooked food! Maybe I'm just used to buffets, but if you are a gonna wait for 5 minutes plus for cooking at least give me something to munch on besides salad. I would like to get some fried or white rice to go white my stir fry but I don't want to wait in line again just to cook some rice.

*Sidenote* The next day I was playing R Kelly Ignition with my bowels. "Give me some Toot and some beep". More like the Dave Chappelle remix.<//review>

I love this place, it has become at least a once a week experience, once it was up to 4 times in a single week.

It makes me a little sad reading some of the negative reviews from people that just don't get it. So for anyone that has not been and is reading this looking for guidance I am posting some help.

It is a LITTLE pricey, dinner is about $17. Not really that pricey, but it depends on what you get. There are unlimited possibilities, but if the first thing you do is grab a 1/2 burger and that fills you up then you are an idiot to pay $17, go to Carls Jr and get the same thing for $4 and stop your whining.

So for the $17 you get unlimited steak, chicken, pork chop, swordfish, shrimp, sausage, ground beef (which you don't need to take an 8oz serving), calamari, mussels, bacon, and several more selections. Add to the protein a huge selection of vegetables, pastas, buns, rice, beans, potatoes, tortillas and cheeses. All this and all you can eat for $17 there is not a better deal on the planet.

So you have unlimited selection and with a little creativity anything imaginable. If you are lost as to what goes together or what sauce to add to your concoction, just ask the Grill Chefs, they have seen it all. I have seen them make things that defy imagination. Like Lasagna, it was really good.

So then I hear complaint about groups. Let me start with Whaaaaa!!! Ok, stop whining. First, I have been with a group of 20, seen bigger than that. Now with any group you can not really engage in conversation with the person 6 down the table from you, so who cares if they are up or not. Second, when we go, usually groups of 4 or 6, we all tend to go up at about the same time, so then it is social as you see what all your friends are getting, then you can stand around the grill and socialize within your group or even meet new people, but you don't have to stand there. Let's say that you are the only one going up for more food at that time, you make your selection, put your bowls on the counter, then go back and join your table being gone for 2 minutes, knowing it will take 10-15 minutes to cook before you go back up to pick up your food. And if it is not super busy the grill chef or waitress will usually bring your food to you.

Personally, our group enjoys standing around the grill talking with the grill chefs, Kevin & RJ rock. I can not think of another restaurant anywhere that you can chat with the person preparing your food.

Service can be varied, there are some great waitresses, Lindsey, and even some that don't seem like they want to be there. But you know what... You are in control... as the customer you are paying them to be there, so if you get lousy service that can be reflected in the amount of tip you leave, if any. I hate being harsh, but if I never see my waitress then why would I pay her for clearing the table when I am done?

Lastly, regarding tipping, be sure to tip the Grill Chefs, they are the ones doing all of the work for you. They make your food whatever it is and however you want it prepared. They also are not tipped out of the waitresses tip, so if you feel they did a good job put the tip in the pitcher on the counter not just leave it on the table.</review>

The cook did last call and allowed my boyfriend and I to pack two big bowls of food each so he can cook it up for us, when they normally only allow one.<//text>

<text>For starters go park on level 4  of the parking structure. Once you get inside the restaurant, you just want to do the tango from the upbeat music and excitement from the smoke of the grill. You now have to be creative to produce a plate of art to debate with your friends and family who's dish is the most flavorful. All in all, great experience and good quality.
Try to sit outside
All in all good experience.</text>< Resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) I went to Disneyland on September 3 and came out for lunch. The price was affordable and the buffet style was so good that I could pick and eat like Teppanyaki and everyone was very friendly! During my trip to the United States, I didn't really like it, so I ate only salads and fruits. It's a pity that this place is not well known to Koreans. If you're going to Disneyland, don't miss it!
Everything was perfect. Nice food, great service. Thank you.

9월3일에 디즈니랜드 갔다가 점심시간에 잠깐 나와서 갔는데 정말 맛있었어요. 가격도 저렴한데다가 뷔페 형식이라 마음에 드는 음식 골라서  철판요리처럼 해서 먹을 수 있었고 다들 친절하셔서 좋았어요! 미국여행  하는동안 입맛 안맞아서 거의 샐러드,과일만 먹고 다녔는데 여기서 처음으로 배부르게 먹었어요. 한국인들한테 이 장소 잘 알려져 있지 않아서 안타까워요. 디즈니랜드 가시는 분들은 꼭 가보세요~
