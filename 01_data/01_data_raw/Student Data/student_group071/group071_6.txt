The only good reviews about this store are done by the staff themselves. Worst customer service to date. Walking to a store where the lowest price for anything  starts at 90$, you'd expect nothing but great service! Come to my surprise to the worst experience of my life. Came in and asked a simple question for a white dress shirt. The employee greeted me with a frown, and guided me to my way. After picking up the right color he made me wear the shirt on top of my already clothing, I was surprised a dress shirt slim fit shouldn't be worn like that, what a professional indeed! I asked him  if I can try the shirt out in the dressing room, he said okay... Next thing I know he left me behind to help someone else with a bigger purchase! Completely ignored me and left behind bare in mind I almost bought the shirt at 125 dollars...
Never going there again horrible experience , rude and lazy staff! Over priced ugly bland clothing! I pray to god they go under new management!</review>

The clerk was very friendly and helpful. They let us walk around and look with out pressure of purchasing now. We did say we wouldn't be purchasing today up front. That might of been why. Lol ♥️ They did listen as you know is a big deal.</Review>

<Text>This is a great place. This Men’s wearhouse is my personal go to suit store. I have always had good experiences here. I recently purchased four suits for a wedding and the service was great. I was able to keep the suits in the store for a few months before getting them tailored as well as actually have one suit sent to Idaho for tailoring and then sent back to be picked up here. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They can get busy and could maybe use a few more staff members during their peak hours but other than that it is an amazing store.< /Text>< Pics>

Great deals here, friendly staff.  I went in looking for a nice winter coat for a UK visit in the winter and one of the staff went out of their way to find me a great deal on a really sharp looking coat that was on clearance surprisingly.  After that, I was a loyal customer.  And have gotten 4 suits from here and plan on getting more.  Look out of their clearance deals on suits, you can save some major bucks on really nice looking suits.</text>

I recently bought a tux here and had the tailoring done when I bought it because I was in a hurry. Normally I get my tailoring done at a small independent shop where I have been going for years, but I just didn't have the time to make it happen on that occasion.
The tailoring here was a little expensive but otherwise very good quality. I figured that the premium price was worth the convenience of this shop being near my house and recently brought in a few pieces that needed some adjustments, only to find out that they "don't do outside tailoring" (i.e. they won't work on pieces that you haven't bought directly from them). Seems pretty class-less and short-sighted. Won't be shopping here again.<//text>

The tailoring service is not very good. The suits are also sub-par. But for the price I suppose its what you pay for. They often have sales that drop their 'premium' suits down to $100-$200 range, which should be where they're at. Ignore any numbers that are over $400.<//Review>

<text>I almost didn't go to this location because the rating was so low. The sales person greeted me immediately. I told him what I was looking for, they didn't have it, found a decent alternative, got a few good deals on some shirts and a jacket. Paid and left. In and out in 20min. Glad I checked the location out for myself.<//text>< Pics>

The staff attitude was ridiculous. The Indian looking guy who were handling the rental department, was very rude and keep pretending that he can not understand me!!! He answered my all questions with only one question; "Are you going to rent/buy today or not?!"  With the kind of attitude you see from this employee, you feel they are racist!!! Don't take your business there!!! I don't remember If I ever left any review for any business, but I felt that this is my responsibility to let other fellows know what is going on in that store!< /text>< UserId.>

Poor customer service and 40 dollars to rent a tie! The sales person refused to add my emails address to the system, even I insisted politely I needed the recipe in my e-mail. 40 dollars to rent a tie is just too much.< /Text>

We have taken videos and pictures of my injuries and the bed bug we found and now wondering what to do because the owner is now ignoring us and not even coming back to the window. We can here him opening and closing the door but no answer after coming out the first time and me personally asking him if he was aware of having bed bugs and him muttering the words "yes" and then going back outside leaving me in the cold to figure out that he wasn't coming back out nor giving us a refund.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Name>

Late night tweakers. Bed bugs galore. Very run-down. What more can you expect from one of the cheapest room rates in Los Angeles. Great place if you're homeless and just looking for an indoor place to sleep. Stay far away if you're looking for any accommodations.</Review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>Had the worst experience... i got rudely awakened by the manger, Victor at 8 am telling me i had a man named cj in my room. I explained there was only us but even with opening my room door and telling him he was free to look he still didnt believe me and he took off saying he would be back. This was my first time in the area and my first time at that place. Not sure where to lodge a complaint but i can leave a heads up for the next person to be cautious. As a woman in the city its essential to feel safe when renting a room and this place is not that.<//Text><resp>None</resp>< name>

As soon as I saw the bed bug I got out of there asked for my money back and the attendant said no only half I said No ALL OF MY MONEY ... I wasnt even there for 1/2 an hour. Taking them to court if I don't get my money back.< /review>

Calvin was great! He was on time, called me in advance that he was coming and worked very fast to unclog the issue with one of our toilet pipes and installed the toilet. He’s professional and courteous! Great worker!! Definitely recommend and will use this company again, their prices are reasonable! Same day service as well! Thank you!< /text>

Nick was great, he ”extracted threads of 1 1/2 nipple for basin drain and then tapped and installed new nipple” in an hour and did an excellent job and I was very happy with what I was charged, it was well worth it and I won't hesitate to call them again, Thanks Nick.< /review>

Thought i needed septic tank drained but they contract that out. Confused communication led to being called during time I was unavailable.  When i called back a guy rotorootered main line and thst appeared to fix it.  But septic tank guy wasn't told and came out.  Good service but not so good communication with workers.<//review>

<Text>After dealing with 2 local plumbing companies & having horrible service from them we found Heart Plumbing. Jessie & Nathan were amazing. On time, explained everything to me, cleaned up, took all trash with them, & they pulled everything out of the cabinets to replace the kitchen faucet & even put everything back better than I had it! Thank you so much!!!! :)<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Heart plumbing is absolutely the best in customer service and very knowledgeable of all our plumbing services. I'm so thankful for their wonderful service ; today's installation of osmosis water line and installation of ice maker!!!
If you want the best service, absolutely call Heart Plumbing in Barstow.
Thank You so much for the blessings.

<Review>Any time I've had to call hearts, the plumbers did the job good. I called today to get a plumber out and the receptionist said she would call me back and let me know when someone would be out and it would most likely be around 1:00, 4 hours go by and I call her back and she tells me theres no way someone can make it today after all. No call back or anything poor service from her all around. Still have clogged pipes and have to find someone else last minute now.<//Review>< Response>

Heart plumbing came out to snake the septic drains. The owner and his crew were extremely professional and stayed until the job was done. They will have all of our business for the services they provide as needed. We thank you truly from the bottom of our hearts. Anyone needing plumbing services in the Barstow and surrounding areas will be sorry if they don't call the plumbing company with a Heart!!!</Review>

Please Call Someone Else because not matter what you will have to call someone to fix their poorly done work. I called them out, had one older rude white man arrive, they were supposed to call when on their way and never did. When I questioned him if he called us he said he will come back and took off to his truck. Very rude and didnt want to speak with me. After calling the office, he came back and looked at the problem. The next day another man came to fix the issue, he was friendly and spoke to me about what he would do ahead of time but yet he failed to open and water lines before turning back on main water line and now I have a bust in a pipe. Maybe hes under experienced, but he also did a poor job changing a simple vavle set, he left the area a mess and made unneeded holes in the shower and did not fix! I had to call the office and then they just caulked it in. Poor Work !

I DONT SUGGEST TO ANYONE.

STAY AWAY FROM THESE PLUMBERS.<//Text>

Horrible customer service. The manager was rude when it came to returning a pair of primo khaki j75 brand dress shoes. He said , "oh I don't stock these brands anymore I literally just sent these ones back." I look to my left from the register and see the same exact pair of shoes sitting on display. Then the manager with the mustache says oh you gotta return it to fashion valley. The receipt clearly says "we will gladly refund or exchange any unworn merchandise with receipt"
Then the manager with the mustache replied with a rude and condescending tone " uhmmm YA NO, Im not returning it here go back to fashion valley"
Very rude and unprofessional. I work in a very similar industry where customer service is key for business success. This manager needs more customer service training. I'm never going to shop to Journeys here in Las America Outlet Mall or Journeys in general.</review>

<Review>Over the past two days I've received thousands of emails asking if the pretzel crust at LC is worth a try. Not to worry fans- I have heard your voice and have an answer to your questions.

YES. The crust would make even Snyder's of Hanover proud. The pizza is solid, and further enhanced by the fact it costs $6 and is ready in as many minutes.

What I would NOT recommend are the chicken wings. If you a really curious as to what they taste/feel like, take a bite out of a microwaved sponge soaked in barbeque sauce. The only earthly substance squishier and slimier than the "meat" is the fleshy tissue (presumably an attempt to emulate skin?) that it is wrapped in. Perhaps the most concerning part is that the bucket of sloppy meat products they are passing off as wings cost more than the pizza.

Ultimately, however, I think the blame falls on me. Shame on me for ordering $8 wings from LC. Since I should have known better, they still get 4 stars.<//Review>< pictures>

Not a good costumer service.
Not a good food presentation.
They always tend to charge more for items not specified.
When paying cash they don't give receipts, perhaps they don't get their salary on time.
Worse than the seven eleven.👎< /review>< Pics>

The pizza was good. My only issue is that I ordered my pizza via telephone about 20 minutes before I arrived to pick it up, but they didn't start making it until I arrived for it.<//Review>

< Review>
For me, this pizza restaurant was lit. I’m pretty much delighted in tasting every flavor of pizzas they served. All of it was delicious. It made me feel so honored that I tasted their specialty. Besides, the crews were nice, kind, and decent. They were showing the smiles on their faces as they served their customers. Because of their outstanding service, they made me reflect on myself that I should keep on coming back for more. Thank you. Till next time!< /Review>

<review>Horrible pizza. No taste at all, raw onion, canned mushroom, no sauce . I ordered chicken wings and it was so dry. God knows how old they were. This was my first take out since 3 months ago (the lock down). Dominos is still my favorite. No more little Greek guy, never ever🤮🤮🤮🤮< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I ordered a $10 supreme and told the guy on the phone to take his time and he said I'll set it for 4:45pm and I got there at 4:43pm and kid told me he probably sold it after he took my money and expected me to wait for another. I had someplace to be and he didn't inform me of his mistake and never offered to reimburse me. So I left with no refund and no pizza. I will never use little ceasars again. They lost a customer.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2bb6904b20253:0x62eab385b26fdae7<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I called to place order, since I was in a bit of a rush, and I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I got there 20 minutes later only to find out the guy took my order wrong. I had to wait another 30 mins, if I wanted my order.
Service is usually good & the pizza is always good, if you have the time to wait.< /review>

<Text>Staff is polite, but the phone is always off the hook here during the day. They must intentionally do it because it’s during hours where they are not busy. They even put you on hold for like 10 mins. The pizza is good though, so no complaints about the taste or quality, but customer services lacks.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Fam, I've done Lil C's, and this ain't it. I know, we've all eaten sweaty cardboard and passed it off as pizza. You know what, sometimes it reminds you of the pioneers, alright?

That being said, this is the slowest and toughest Little Caesars to ever return to. I've tried 4 times, and that's 3 times too many. I've seen a Hot N' Ready sitting in the warming box, just waiting to be scarfed down. I paid the nice cashier fella my $5+Tax. He says, "Ok, just a minute." The next thing I know, he's disappeared to the back, and then comes back staring at a stack of receipts. I mean lots of receipts. You'd have thought he was translating papyrus.

I look at my watch. Horror. Shock. That same pizza is sitting in the warmer, 5 more people have come in and ordered, and the poor chap is still running around with those RECEIPTS. At this point, there's a cacophony of conversations, videos being played on phones, and disgruntled coughs and mutters.

The watch is pulling at me...look down, I must. It's been almost 15 minutes and I still see that pizza sitting in the warmer. Finally, for a reason unknown to me, the pizza is pulled out and shakily handed my way. "Need anything else sir?"
Nothing you can give me.
Some self-respect maybe. More self-control. A different choice of Little Caesar's. I'm not even sure anymore.

I crack open that box once I get to the car. I peel a slice from its comrades, and I'm met with another disappointment.
The slice is stiff as a board.

Save yourselves, go elsewhere.</Review>

Prepare to wait.

The only reason to go to little caesars is to get something fast, but this location never has anything “hot and ready”.

The most terrible customer service and experience I’ve EVER had ordering pizza! They messed up on my order 3x and I ordered my food early and it wasn’t ready! I wasn’t offered curtesy of a free drink or bread sticks or sauce! The woman at the register didn’t even understand English and the” manger” argues with me about what I ordered! Like what!?</Review>

<Text>After several customers who ordered after us were served, we realized we had been waiting too long. Eventually, the staff admitted to 'forgetting' about our order and finally got it started. When we got our order finally, they wouldn't even comp some ranch sauce at the very least. When we got home, we found that they didn't even cut the pizza. Could have ordered from Domino's and had our food faster with better results! Not even one star.</Text>< rating>

<Review>This place is not very welcoming. I walked in to two lady employees arguing. Then after standing their awkwardly for 5 minutes, the lady tells the other one “you have a customer to help him.” And then the pizza wasn’t even hot and ready. Had to wait for them to make it.<//Review>< date>

Wasn't so sure when we stopped by. We split the ribs. Excellent. I had french fries, which were crispy and yummy. Wife had rice pilaf, which she liked. Had choloate pie and coffee for dessert. Pie was great, good coffee. Service was excellent. Very pleased.</text>

Seeing that they are the only restaurant in the area and on the Yosemite View Lodge property, the food and service  was pretty good. They have a pizza joint next door that is really good too. I was very pleasantly surprised.<//text>

<text>The restaurant no longer offers a breakfast menu,  only a breakfast buffet now. They also only had indoor dining for breakfast, even during this pandemic when outdoor dining is a standard. The buffet consists of cold toast, cold pancakes that are stuck together, runny oatmeal with no toppings, country gravy, hard and dry biscuits, French toast, sausage, bacon that tastes like it was cooked right next to bell pepper (yummy for me but not for my 6 year old), eggs scrambled with bell pepper/onion/mushroom/cheese, and bland plain scrambled eggs.  They never cleared plates from our table or came by to check on us. I had to find someone to ask for extra napkins. The salt on our table had the top unscrewed which made me doubt that they had sanitized things between customers. I would not eat here again.</text>< Date>

Of course meals were delicious here. Really good pesto pasta with chicken, fish and chips. Unlimited salad and soup for each meal ordered. Restaurant times are limited and can get full quickly. Try to get there when they open for dinner at 5:30pm. Way way way way pricey. This lodge should a few affordable food places built cafeteria style to accommodate large numbers of tourists instead of a fancy pricey restaurant in the middle of nowhere. Other places to eat are more than 30 min drive from here. So bring meals and snack with you or be prepared to drive far distance for each meal or pay insane amounts at river restaurant.<//text>

We went to the River Restaurant on a Sunday and the bartender there was just amazing. He was so friendly and gave us great tips for Yosemite. We would very much recommend the pizza, it was delicious!</Review>

Fish & chips always great! Bartender amazing! Love eating here at least once when we're visiting! A bit pricey but expected since we're so far from any other restaurants.<//Text>

<text>I feel bad to leave a bad review since business is tough for these restaurants,  especially in the forest but they can do so much better.  I ordered breakfast to go, there was one older man server but he was busy on the phone. The manager came out to ask, it took him 10 min to find the menu. He didn't know where it was and went back and forth to ask.  Then when he gave the food, there was no utensil, ketchup or napkin. Pretty much just a box of blame food.  Luckily I had my own stuff in the car to eat or else we'd eat by hand. Food was horrible,  order scramble eggs,  hash brown and toast. $15. Not worth it.  The pizza place next door service and food is better but they don't have breakfast.  Manager was very miserable.</text>< Resp>

I don't know why this restaurant has a very small rating(2,7)? Yes, maybe it is not the best one, but it has an amazing location, a beautiful view to a river and a normal price.The waiter was very friendly and fast.  food may be is not very delicious. My rating is: food-3⭐️, waiter-5⭐️,location-5⭐️< /Text>

Very well organised and accessible spot. They offer big meals and for affordable prices. We loved the meals a lot and the staff members were very affable and chatty. Highly recommended.</text>

I really wanted to give this a 5 star. It's a nice place to stay, but like anything near a national park, overpriced. Sad that it puts staying near national treasures out of the reach of many American families.< /Text>

They're one of two restaurants just outside Yosemite, so this venue could really be so much more. It has a great start: it sits on the bank of the Merced River and the view is wonderful. The staff is friendly and we get the 'cabin' theme, but the interior is dated and dank, it smells stale, the carpet is worn, and it just feels pieced together. For that reason, we're happy we requested to sit on the deck outside overlooking the river. Our server, Shawn, was personable and answered our questions about items the menu. My pesto fettuccine was tasty, but nothing extraordinary. Still I was satisfied, and enjoyed a nice Chardonnay with it. My husband's chicken Marsala was 'nothing special,' although the mashed potatoes were good. He was pretty disappointed with what he ordered. The meals came with a salad bar (which may explain the higher cost for entrees other reviewers talked about), but it was the least appealing of everything we experienced there. The bar itself was located in a small, poorly-lit, room that seemed like an afterthought. The lettuce/spring mix didn't appear fresh and the serving spoons and trays looked like they hadn't been wiped down for several hours. The salad bar was average. The one upside is that the vegetable soup tasted fresh and it was delicious. Overall, our experience there was only average, quite unremarkable. We highly recommend the pizzeria next door, though. We assume they're owned by the same group, but are not sure. Looking back, we'd have rather eaten pizza two nights in a row because it was that good and our experience at River Restaurant was just okay.< /text>

<text>The breakfast buffet was terrible and costs $17.95 per person. Basically microwaved food and some of the worst coffee I’ve had. Additionally, some of the plates and other glasses were not clean. There isn’t much to choose from in the area but recommend just finding a way to make yourself instant oats or visit one of the restaurants in the park. We also visited the Majestic in the park and though priced similarly, higher quality with fresh coffee.< /text>< pics>

<review>The food is average at very best. Everything was over cooked. The cheeseburger came without cheese. The fish and chips was way over-fried with very little actual fish. The fries were nice and crispy, though. The main reason for the three stars is that it's very expensive for what you're getting. The servers were very nice, friendly, and quick.< /review><Name>Maggie Bourne</Name><time>1521329098975<//time>< resp>

It was off season, so maybe this review is not relevant all year round. Salad bar was lacking, no cheese. My burger was okay at best. Prices were somewhat high, but to be expected for the middle of nowhere in the valley. The prices were definitely too high for the poor quality of food.

The fries were very good, so there's a star. And the atmosphere is nice.< /Text>

Good food. Reasonable price. Friendly service. Fish and chips met expectations. Salad and soup bar was good too--all you can eat. Salad fixings were fresh. Cream of broccoli soup tasted good. Diet Pepsi glass was always full.< /Review>

<text>First we had to wait for 45 minutes to get a table (which we were completely fine with), then wait maybe 10–15 minutes more to order after we had decided what to have. At this stage we started to get annoyed, even though our nice waiter had told us "I'll be right back". After order we had to wait again for some very long time (felt like it was over half an hour) to get our pasta dishes. At this stage, being very very hungry, we cleaned the plates in less then 10 minutes. My pasta was really tasty and the staff was nice (and you could tell they were under a lot of stress trying to accommodate all guests) but all the waiting wasn't worth the trouble.</text>< Pics>

We were both extremely displeased with our food.  I specifically asked if the salmon was "wild caught" or "farm raised" and the waitress told me wild with hesitation.  The salmon was most definitely farm raised and had an awful taste.  My husband ordered the prime rib and there was also zero flavoring - which is what a prime rib is all about! The staff was nice but very slow - waited over 10 minutes for our check.  Don't waste your hard earned money on extremely low quality and overpriced food.<//Review><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

We were very surprised of this restaurant. Yes the prices for the main dishes are a little bit expensive (about $20) but you are "far away" from civilisation. And every main dish includes free use of the salad bar. After the first night we got aware you could order the salad bar (including two soups) for only $9.99. This was a great price which we had nowhere before.< /review>

Really expensive and not that tasty. Strange smell in the restaurant also. Like the canteen at work where everyone brings their own dish. Ok service.</review>

Was the only option other than a pizza place, completely disappointed in the food, and the cost. We had the ribs which were tough, and honey chicken with the chicken as dry as anything. Only saving grace was the unlimited salad bar although lacking in variety. Drove 45mims to Mariposa the next night just to get some decent food which was completely worth it</text>

17,95$ for a very low quality breakfast. The only + is the fresh orange juice.</Text>

< review>
The restaurant isn't always open in convenient hours, especially in winter, but when open, stays fairly busy. It appears fairly clean in the dining area. They have an adequate soup and salad bar. The menu is not extensive, but usually I can find something I can select from. While I consider the food fairly mediocre, I realize we do not have a world class chef from New York or Paris. We are in a little drink water town...wait we're not actually "in" a town, we're at a hotel, so we have a cook who lives in the back woods and we wonder why we don't get haute cuisine? Personally, I'd be happy with a really good chuck wagon cook--we didn't even get that, so I give only 3 stars. SECOND. I wish people would stop complaining about how much everything costs. Think just a minute will you. Where did the food come from? Out there grown on those rocks? No, it was trucked in in trucks at a high cost of gasoline as everyone well knows. Then tack on that the labor of loading and that of the driver to get the food here. I have driven behind some of these trucks going 10-15 miles per hour up the long hills. IT TAKES FOREVER! How much do you think that costs? Wait. We haven't gotten the food to the restaurant yet. Get it here and pay to get it unloaded. Refrigerate it (oh yes, higher electricity bills because the power lines are far more expensive to place, here.). Now, clean and pay the overpaid cook to waste what shouldn't be wasted and cook the meal, cook the wrong meal, recook the meal, and lose the tips for everyone because of complaints about the slowness and poor quality of the meal.Costs rack up in a variety of ways. Just remember, though, everything is expensive up here because it ALL has to be trucked up here--hence, the higher prices and fewer choices. Complain about the cooking, yes, but be aware of the why of higher prices.</review>

Great service, the salad bar and soups are nice, i had the ny steak and my girl had the citrus charbroiled chicken. Steak was alright the chicken was good but the citrus sauce tasted like it was missing something therr wasnt much flavor to it. Would i recommend people to eat here if they are passing by or staying at the motel right there, yes i would but be prepared to pay a pretty penny and as you should expect considering it is pretty far from a city. I would definitely come here again though if i was to visit Yosemite once again.< /Review>

We ordered the chicken breast and the salmon, it was really cheap chicken, the french fries were very dark, made with too much fat. Same story with the salmon. The vegetables were 50% zucchini, 50% cucumber, both just cooked and tasted like nothing.

On the other hand the pricing was extreme. The chicken breast were 22 Dollars, the salmon 27. Not accaptable for that really bad quality.
If you want to share your expencive food, you have to pay 8(!) Dollars just for an empty second plate.

The only good thing in this restaurant was our server.< /text>< Date>

Only restaurant in the area especially if you stay at the lodge so you are left with this restaurant as the only dinner option (besides the pizzeria next door).
Unfortunately the service is extremely slow.</Text>

(Translated by Google) It will take some time before the food is served, but you can rest assured that there is a delicious salad bar. The drawback is that the vegetables in the salad bar are slow to replenish.
I shared and ate the dishes, but they were all delicious.
There are few restaurants around here, so it is recommended that you check early and decide on a shop.

(Original)
料理が出るまで少々時間がかかりますが、美味しいサラダバーがあるので安心です。サラダバーの野菜の補充も遅いのが難点ではあります。
料理はシェアして食べましたが、どれも美味しかったです。
この辺はレストランが少ないので早めにチェックして、お店を決めておくことをオススメします。< /Review>

Continues to hold large gatherings in the pandemic, despite putting our elderly communities at risk. Truly horrifying. The only thing that could turn it around would be if they start limiting people allowed at events, and mandating masks while not eating. Or even eating outside! Christ! Talk about doing the bare minimum. How do you describe a place that does below that?</Review>

< Review>
The Elk's Lodge has excellent halls to rent for parties or whatever you are celebrating. I have been to two events there and the facilities are excellent. One hall is large and the other is smaller. To use these facilities you need to a member or know a member of the Elk's Lodge. They have other facilities available to members, also.</Review>

This store is clean, easy to navigate and find what I'm looking for. Or if I don't have time to look, they are right there up front, ready to answer questions or find the exact model I need, or suggestion where to find it if they don't have it. Always with a smile and helpful as can be. I've had my battery changed a couple times there and I'm so impressed and grateful that they will change it for you right there in the parking lot. Excellent service, thank you!!</Text>

<text>We live in East Sacramento County. My son went to Kayak and vacation near Susanville. While there the vehicle broke down. AAA wouldn't respond because I was not with the vehicle, so I drove up there last night.  The truck he was driving had lost all its coolant, so while driving up there, I called the Susanville Autozone. A helpful lady came on the line (Shania) and proceeded to help me identify the correct radiator hoses for the truck.   There were two possibilities so she identified both and checked to make certain that they were in stock. The process took several minutes and she was very nice about it the whole time. I paid by cc over the phone and told her that my son would be in to pick them up. They close at 8:00 pm and I couldn't get there until after 8:00. I arrived at Autozone about 8:20 and met my son there. He had the hoses and the store was closed.  We found instead that a small rubber cap and popped off the radiator. The last employee (Grant) was backing out of the parking lot and I went and got his attention. I asked as nicely as I could if there was any way he could sell me a part. He had to call another manager to come back to the store which he did. We got the part and installed it and got my son back on track to his vacation. In today's poor customer service climate that we live in, I cannot believe that there are people who will go to this length to help someone out. Thank you so much Autozone of Susanville.  You set a standard for others to envy. BTW, I am already a loyal customer of Autozone in Citrus Heights because of good service, but this was definitely another level of over the top customer service.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x809d961e2e4f7b8b:0x58406a3bca98c0d<//gmapID>< Response>

<Review>Okay this review is late but while traveling from DFW to warrenton, Oregon, during Thanksgiving, we had to make a stop at this store in Susanville.  We were two women traveling alone In mountains we didn’t have a clue about.  We had never really driven in ice or snow and our planned route was suddenly out of the question due to rough mountain weather and roads.  Let me tell you, as a woman I was BLOWN AWAY by the help we received from this store.  There was especially a girl there that sold us chains for our tires and helped us reroute thru the mountains so that we could make it to Oregon.  This mother and daughter will never forget how much better we felt after leaving there.  We suddenly weren’t terrified about driving the roads we were directed towards and we were for the first time confident we could make it to Klamath Falls (which wasn’t our original destination) but ended up being where we stopped for the night.  I can’t thank her enough for being so kind and autozone will be where my family shops from now on for auto parts!!</Review>< pictures>

< review>
ZERO STARS! Came inside and asked an employee to look at my lights to make sure I was buying the right one. He ended up giving me the wrong ones so I came back and told them it didn’t fit. They said since it’s new, it’s harder to put in and when I asked for help the other employee just shook his head. Two GROWN men couldn’t even bother to help a 19 year girl old put new lights in. Awful customer service, and treated me like I was dumb.<//review>

<review>This store pretty much has everything I go there for. Three stars because the staff is not very attentive. The last several times I've been in there ready to check out, it seems that no one knows who's suppose to be running the register. They always yell to one another asking who's on the register, "so and so is but he's at lunch" or some similar response.

Update: much better experience last time I went. Changed rating to 4 stars. The staff member that helped me was very friendly. He had an issue with the register not working properly (like every time before) but handled it well and just moved me to a different register. May be management should look into updating registers.</review>< user>

<Text>One of three major auto parts retailers in Susanville and they offer competitive pricing on most parts and products. On this particular visit I was just needing to drop off used motor oil, and David was more than happy to help. Very friendly and even provided the CA used oil tax refund credit upon leaving. Great customer service. Nice job and keep it up! Thank you David!< /Text></record>

Really good place for competitive prices sometimes a little on the pricey side but their customer service is fantastic. The most recent visit stepped in for a battery check they probably came out testing my battery let me know I had a bad battery but it was a good battery lasted 8 years and recommended a battery for my specific car and help me out.</Text>

It is hard to distinguish between automotive places anymore.  They all seem to be the same store with a different name.  For the small town of Susanville it is nice to have a larger store with trained staff like AutoZone.</Review>

<date>1481587821781< /date><rate>1< /rate><Review>Tried to get a brake m/cyl for two weeks. I'm 50 miles away. Couldn't pick it up for 3 days so they sent it back. Reordered it, they called and said it was in. When I had it picked up, it was a caliper. Wrong part. They called and said it was their fault and they had the m/cyl and if I sent someone in they would give me the right part.. instead, they took the caliper and credited it to the card and demanded money from my 17 year old for the m/cyl. Without calling me, they Sent him away with no part. I paid for the cylinder. Got nothing. Brendan just gave me excuses for the manager and their faulty system. I hate dealing with liars and idiots. Zero customer service.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Apria is TERRIBLE.  Last year, they lost a CPAP order and had to send me a new one.  This year they did not deliver a replacement CPAP (although they claimed they rang doorbell for signature, there was no slip left afterwards).  After I called them, they supposedly sent me another set to replace that one.  Every other company gives a tracking number and link in an email confirmation but Apria does not send confirmations to people.  Per their orders, I called them a couple days later to get tracking information.  Then they kept me on hold forever while their rep hunted high and low for my order, even with the order number I gave them.  She finally found the information.  Erratic deliveries, terrible database and tracking.  Also, keep your ears open for a knock on your door because, for some reason, a CPAP mask requires a signature upon delivery (even though most other medications do not).<//text>< date>

The company must have low bid Kaiser to get the contract to service Kaiser clients.  The service and communication from this company is horrible from top to bottom.  You get different answers every time you call in.  The 4 hours window for service is a lack of the company's commitment to develop a better system to exceed their clients expectations. 4 hour span is catering to the company and not  the client.  I am also very disappointed in Kaiser and fortune 500 company that sub-contract such a poor performance company.  Apria performance is connected to my total medical care experience.  Kaiser I hope you are able to influence the performance of your subcontractors because it will influence your reputation. Kaiser you to rich to play with little, poor performing subcontractors.  You have known this company has years of complaints and you still stay with them. That decision does not speak highly of the management's leadership.< /Review>

My doctor ordered a CPAP machine in November and I still haven’t got it I’ve called every day for three weeks they did not get the number from Kaiser they  told me it was coming from Kansas instead of Lundy Avenue and everybody had a different answer and it was just the worst experience I’ve ever had and I still don’t have my CPAP machine and it was guaranteed to be here today Monday I’ve actually had to explain my situation seven times being on the phone for an hour each time<//Text>

Stay Away... DON’T SIGN ANYTHING, DON’T GIVE YOUR SSN. They always send bills and make you pay them even you have full insurance even no service. I called customer service 10 times. I have another machine and another service they still sending bills, I tried but they never cancel my account. Stay away for better service or pay for noting long time.<//text>

Initial visit to set up oxygen equipment for my wife.
Apria Rep (Mark) was absolutely professional, knowledgeable and courteous.
This experience was completely positive.

<Review>Even if the medical supply providers have one star review, the patients have no choice because the doctors work with them and they are "in network" with the insurance company.

American's health care system is broken. Doctors, medical supply providers and the insurance companies work together only to take advantage of the patients. Just like "A patient cured is a customer never coming back"! Doctors are very slow and ineffective. Medical supply providers do NOT deliver the equipments that are not covered by the insurance even if they are  medically necessary. Patients have to wait for various "pre-authorizations" that delay the treatments but benefit the insurance companies. Lots of miscommunication/errors easily occur in such a broken system. Their goal is to take advantage of vulnerable patients with inflated medical bills and compromised treatments that may cost the patient's life.

The American health care system is the darkest business I have ever experienced in the modern society.</Review><date>1570840356550</date>< Name>

I had some supplies ordered by my health care provider sent to the wrong address so called the direct (not 800) number to get my record updated. The woman I spoke with was extremely helpful and got everything updated for both me and my husband. Since others indicate they had poor experiences with the customer service I don't want to take the chance of ordering a travel CPAP machine from them.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>These folks are extremely disorganized. You never can reach the last person that you talked with. You will hear many different stories from many different people at Apria. For my order, I heard "ok, we'll have it tomorrow". Then tomorrow comes and then I hear that this might take another 3-9 days. Wow.  Then I get a call saying that they will not ship to me without a credit card number! So how much are you going to charge this card number? Answer: "we don't know". So why do you need this number? Answer: "we need it in case you die and can't pay the final bill". Well you cannot charge a credit card of a dead man. That makes no sense. After further probing, it appears that Apria wants me to "write a blank check" to them in the event that they screw up the insurance and are too lazy to do the paperwork. If I could give these guys a zero, I would. Don't give these guys an unlimited ability to charge your credit card! When faxing them, there is always some kind of a screw-up. It is extremely rare that a large fax will succeed, even if you get the confirm page on your local fax machine as "received". Faxes go to a central number and they often screw up when forwarding the pages to the local office (BTW that forwarding process typically takes 45-60 minutes). In my last case, of a 25 page fax, only one page actually made it! I had to send this whole mess again! Basically Apria can be a never ending hassle. I rate their customer service at -1, less than zero. This can be truly horrific.< /Review>< pictures>

Had a CPAP machine ordered. I never recieved a notice that the machine was going to be delivered on any particular day. Out of the blue I get a call from a driver saying that he is at my house and can wait 5 minutes for me. I am at work and just can leave let alone get back home in 5 minutes. I understand it is a medical device and that need to receive it in person but there was no line of communication established. Even if they gave me a call the day before it would have been the bare minimum but acceptable. I can understand why they have such a terrible review. No one answers at the local office and now I have to jump through hoops and sit through long holds just to try to get my machine. Very frustrated.</text>

Sitting here in the waiting area of Apria San Jose following an unfortunate situation where my CPAP machine broke and I had to urgently rent one.  Luckily I rented it from the Apria in El Segundo and worked with the lovely and very helpful receptionist there.   Unfortunately I had difficulties and needed to go to the San Jose Apria where the  respiratory therapists that I met with was rude and very unfriendly  to the concerns that I had and questions that I asked. I am in healthcare and have had to use a cpap for 23 years.  I believe that I know how to work with people who have questions to a healthcare professional and have had enough experience using a CPAP to ask a relatable question to this healthcare professional.  I also got to sit and listen to the first three ladies on the right side of the office, including the RT, talk negatively about Kaiser. So it is clear that this office does not care how they work with and present themselves to customers. On a positive note and five stars to Vinnie the receptionist who was most helpful to me. Avoid Apria in San Jose if you can!</review>

<Text>I called Apria to order my tanks for oxygen and I was told that it will be delivered the following day. I have waited the whole day and nobody came. The customer representative was also asking for my credit card information so that they could secure my account which is not making any sense for me. When I did not give my credit card information their representative hang up the phone on me. She was also rude.</Text>< Pictures>

I created my own problem by leaving the AirSense 10 power cord 3,000 miles away. Called Apria and was told to order it online (3 - 5 days to get it!!). Asked if the San Jose location might have a cord. The Apria rep called San Jose and couldn't reach anyone or leave a message. Again said I had had to order one from Apria Direct. Waited and waited on hold with Apria Direct. Hung up. Called CPAP Services, a different provider. Spoke with someone who understood my issue right away. They contacted the local "store" confirming they had plenty of cords. Was able to go pick one up today. The person greeted me by name when I walked in. What a big difference in customer service! Yes, my fault. But, hugely thankful for CPAP Services!</Review>

After months of requesting they pick up air compressor & tanks and them refusing to pick them up after I agreed to sign a release form, they now want to send me to collection for not paying a bill that they created by forcing me to keep the equipment.
Follow up:  My insurance company spoke with Apria while I was on hold at the same time & found out that Apria was not sending them invoice and quoted me my portion of the bill.  Sent in check, wrote  "paid in full".  They cashed the check and three days letter left message on my phone they were sending me to collection for the balance.   Something needs to be done about this company.  I'm telling my doctor that I will refuse to allow/accept any equipment form Apria.<//review>

This is the worst business entity existing.  They will put you on hold for more than an hour and will cut you off even if you are still talking.  They are not sensitive that people who are calling here are 99%disabled. Duh? They will always leave a recording when they try to reach you and when you call back, be prepared for the longest waiting time.  They also cheat on shipments, check your receipts.  They usually bill you twice, look at your shipment inventory carefully.  I wish there is a zero or negative star, they don't deserve a stat at all.< /Review>

Worst customer service ever. They have sent me items for my CPAP machine I did not order. They are now billing me for them. I have been on the phone for an accumulative of an hour and a half. Hung up on 4 times. Can't hear them or understand them. Not just anyone can fix my problem. i was told only 1 person can fix it and that person is incompetent on understanding my situation of their mess up. This is garbage. What a horrible service provider. I may look else where for a CPAP supplier.<//Text>

I have never had a more frustrating company to work with in my life. The SNF had ordered equipment from them for us and after following up three times  and them missing a promised delivery, i finally cancelled our order.  Doing that was a nightmarish process. I am still wondering if the credit will come through. Their Customer service people, once you finally get to them, have poor english skills and connections are poor.  Give them your cc number at your risk. I have informed  the SNF of our issues.Terrible  terrible service. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.</text>

<Review>I rarely complain about any service, but this time really pissed me off.
Worst of the worst service, unreliable& unprofesshional service and hidden fees, never give them ur credit card info, they will charge u without asking, for the breastbump we ordered, it has been back and force 4 times w the wrong handling and equipment, we asked the specific brand and model expicitly and only the insurance fully covered one, but beside billing without asking, they did everything wrong, they should not exist in business, be aware before u consider them as provider if no other choice.
----------------------------------------------------------
And YES, I used the phone number below given by below, I have contacted the customer care online service and left message too, and in the last 7 days, there's no one &nothing responding. Then I tried again, I was hold on the phone for more than 1 hour, the only thing they did is bounce me back and force between customer service dept and billing since none of them can make a decision, and apparently this is messed up, I got a feeling they charged me twice due to some internal human error, but no one would like to admit it, and no solution so far. I've given up on them,  if u look at other e.g. twitter, Apria seems to really had a bad mouth. I would never use them again.</Review>< Rate>

They do not even deserve one star, customer service is perhaps the worst ever, in fact you would look forward to going to the DMV after a visit here. Workers are unwilling and often refuse to answer simple questions on equipment set up. Calling them is an experience in patience as most phone workers can not speak english nor understand why you are calling. They send thugs to your house if you do not submit bullshit paperwork right away. Absolutely,  hands down the WORST place I have ever had to deal with.</review>

I began the process of replacing my old cpap machine about the middle of April. As of 6/23/15, Apria is now telling me they still haven't got everything they need to provide it. There have been miscommunications, incorrect information given to me, and multiple occasions of conflicting advice from so-called Apria trained individuals. There is not a single incorrect claim in the negative reviews the company has gotten except that the reviews are better than Apria deserved. If I could give them a "no star" rating, I would. I am 69 years old, and, until now, have never had to deal with a company as incompetent as this one.<//Review>

Yes, absolutely a lame service company. No record of a detailed order that was placed. Agent did not know any answers to my questions. Nothing was recorded. Put me on hold forever and never came back.

This type of company should have top notch service, you are dealing with handicap persons's needs that are crucial for time and delivery.</Review>

My word - what a terrible company! In just three months since I started using Apria (unfortunately the only provider for my health insurance company) I have so many bad experiences it's almost comical. Unreturned calls, missed supplies, unclear and conflicting instructions and information, uncredited payments (they still haven't credited a cash payment I made in March - it is now June!). I don't know how good or bad their competitors are, but if you have a choice then please consider another provider.</review>

Worst. I can even try giving 0 stars to this place.These guys are nuts. They infact blame the customers. My insurance was ready to pay for my wife's pregnancy utility. But, these people kept hanging . And worse, after spending more than 1 week, they call and say that, they cannot order this item as per their company policy until baby is born. Which is a complete BS.
First of all, why its non sense, and second of all, why didnt they tell their company policy 10 days advance.</review>

Absolute worst customer service. Many times can't get my order right and deliveries are always late.
I have called the last few times waiting at least 30 minutes for customer help and no help comes.

I'm amazed by how many different ways Apria can screw up my recurring order of supplies. It's been a standing recurring order for years, and there are times where the whole process falls apart and it takes many weeks to resolve. Very poor communication and follow-up from Apria.< /review>

Second time visiting this location. Honestly my favorite place to get my acrylic nails done. I made an appointment with my favorite nail tech Miranda. I showed her another picture of what I wanted and she was more than happy to make my nails exactly like the picture. I also appreciated the fact that she asked if the colors were right and was incredibly detailed. Miranda works efficiently and she will make your acrylics the highest quality and THEY LAST! I'll continue to come to this location.< /text>

Staffs are amazing people and such a great representation of Milan Nails and Spa Too.  I've recently has some health problems, and they have gone out of their way to make sure I'm comfortable and taken care of.  This is such a sanctuary in Fresno!<//Review>

<review>Yesterday I went to get my nails done. I asked the lady to do an overlay with a pink color I found in the gel nail selection bucket. She brought out one color of the polish and opened it to show me. I let her know it was a little dark. She said "I know what you are wanting. It's the natural pink." I smiled and said yes. She came back with the perfect color. As I was getting my nails done by Linda, I felt comfortable with the neutral music playing in the background. Linda took her time doing my nails and my nails came back exactly as I wanted them to look. They are shaped beautifully. Linda was also quick to greet me when I first came in as a walk in. I was in and out of the nail salon within and hour and fifteen minutes. I highly recommend getting your nails done or pedicure done. The staff is very polite and professional. Also, the price was not too bad either. I paid $35.50.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5dDf3bP_6PIsWtyI_K0nWbkLyDxjF2fBQCWvT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrLkHY1GBXJBPQtLI27DDxCv9xg0tWN_6nNSXJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

I really wanted to love this place, but their acrylic overlay barely lasts. I had to go in twice in two weeks to get my nails completely redone because they broke doing simple things like putting my coat on. I’ve never had this problem with other salons. Sucks, but oh well! If you can afford to pay to get your nails done every two weeks then this is the place for you!<//text>

Got a pedicure here and the price was good, the service nice.... and the music (old crooner music from the 40s) superb!
The gal let me relax and didn’t try to up sell me on a bunch of things.
No complaints. Very professional and clean.
I love to go here while the kiddo is st the kid gym next door. Perfect location for this Mom!</review>

Last time I went they didn't do a good job on the pedicure and it's not cheap

<Text>I will never have my eyelashes done here again. The application process was painful and uncomfortable with stinging. *which the process is not stupposed to be uncomfortable* After the treatment several of my eyelashes were stuck together and pointed in different directions. Some employees had also brought their kids in and I had to listen to them run around and scream in the back for 2 out of my 3 hours there. Now there are also big chunks of strong black glue at the base of my eyelashes. Getting them removed ASAP would not reccomend for eyelash extensions.<//Text>< Response>

<Text>Recently used Ray O. Cook to install a mini split system in our house. Staff were very responsive on the phone and very helpful/knowledgeable. Got Danny out to our house for a quote shortly, and appreciated his knowledge and fair inspection of the job! He was great.

The install went smoothly and all the workers were very professional. System works great and makes such a difference in our house! Very thankful for the reccomendations of the staff when trying to find the right system, and very happy with the results. We had a great experience all around. From the office staff to the technicians - very top notch.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Very responsive, dependable and professional.  Easy and quick scheduling of the technician visit.
The tech was very courteous and careful.  Did a thorough job and took the time to explain what he was doing and his findings.
I highly recommend Ray O. Cook who, through the years, always came through with a great job at very reasonable rates.  Keep up the great work!<//Review>< pictures>

Called on a Saturday morning after air stopped blowing cold the previous night. Garrett came out within a few hours despite lack of availability for other HVAC companies.  He was friendly,  competent and professional.  Identified the broken part, swapped from inventory on his truck,  checked other key components and was finished quickly.  This company knocked it out of the park and im a tough one to please! Nice job.<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I really had no reference of what company or equipment was the best quality for the best price!  I interviewed 6 rep's  the "Big Box" stores down to the local guy.  My home had the original 1987 heater and air condenser that required a charge R22, every spring.  It's just to darn hot up here to have your A/C shutdown when it's over 100 degrees.  I wanted a complete matched unit with warranty and service over price.
I decided to choose a local guy established in the 40's, Ray O. Cook heating and air company explained what size of equipment I needed for my home. I like it when a business says what they will do and actually do more than that.  I was notified of the install date and their crew was on time and actually finished earlier than planned. The complete install took most of the day, but I didn't have to cleanup a thing I side or outside!
Thanks Paul!<//Text>< pics>

Danny provided an estimate for replacing my home heating and air. This will be the second home I have used Ray O. Cook to replace old heater and air conditioning. Danny answered all our questions and made the process super easy. This is a great company to deal with.<//text>

<text>Friendly, honest, and quality service! Technician took the time to clearly explain the inner workings, condition, and repair needed for our HVAC system. We signed up to have them return in the spring for A/C tune up as well another furnace check next winter. Received significant discount on three inspections this way.< /text>< pictures>

<review>We have been customers of Ray O. Cook for several years now and have always been pleased with the service we received. I would like to give a shout out to Sonny O., the technician who came for our regular heating maintenance.

From the call to let us know he was on the way to the entire service experience, Sonny had reviewed our account history before setting foot in the door, he was courteous, polite, sensitive to protective measures, and made sure our questions were answered. Sonny is a wonderful asset to the Ray O. Cook team!<//review>< pictures>

Paul came to our house to give us an estimate for replacing our existing (old) system. He was very knowledgeable in every aspect of the process. He had many years in the field doing the work before moving into making bids and it was obvious. He was personable and didn't even mind our dogs bugging him for attention.
After a couple more estimates we decided to go with Ray O Cook and are very happy we did. Our team was great; professional, prompt, personable, and tidy. They all seemed to know what they were doing and the leads, Dave, Enrique, and Rick all seemed very informed and good at their specialties.  They stuck around, particularly Dave, until all the bugs were worked out, making it at least a 10 hour day for them!  I would highly recommend them for any of your HVAC needs.</Text>

<text>Patrick came out to give us a second opinion on the condition if our heater. He took more time than the first two service tech from. The other company combined. He did a thorough inspection, disc I united some of what was reported but we do still need to replace. He was able to explain the problems he saw and why it would be better to replace than to fix. We have a RayOCook estimator coming today. I am very pleased with Patrick's work, advice, and dedication to excellence! Thank you!<//text><date>1607381775823< /date>< user_name>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>The technicians that have come to the house to perform maintenance on our heating and AC systems have always been very polite and professional and we believe, thorough. Thus far, we don't feel like they've tried to sell us something we don't need. They change our filters which is very helpful as we are seniors. The $149 maintenance plan is well worth the money given the exhorbidant cost of these services taken individually. We do have peace of mind knowing our systems are being looked after on a regular basis. We may feel differently if we ever have a catastrophic occurence that necessitates an outlay of thousands of dollars but that's not Cook's fault. We will be renewing our plan as long as the price stays affordable.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1611075520437, 'text': 'Great to hear!

Danny was excellent. He was very knowledgable, friendly, and courteous. He took more time to get to know our system than any of the competitors. I think he made solid recommendations and he backed those recommendations up with facts on the spot.
I'd highly recommend Ray O. Cook to anyone looking for a system. They are a company that you can trust.< /review>

Ray O Cook Heating & Air is one of the most professional and companies I have ever had the pleasure of utilizing.  Rory Ahrens was the technician who worked on my equipment.  He was exceedingly competent and knowledgeable.  I will allow no one else but Ray O Cook Heating & Air to work on my equipment.  They are the best.

I will add that I contacted Ray O. Cook Heating and Air to replace my entire HVAC system.  They did not disappoint.  The system installation was perfect.

In particular: Willie Daffern, Rick Tudor, and the rest of the team (sadly I did not get all their names) were nothing short of outstanding in their commitment to quality work and fine-tuning the details.<//Text>

I called late in the evening and got someone at our house within two hours, and at a very fair price for emergency call, and TOTALLY worth it! Our technician San was absolutely wonderful. He was incredibly professional and courteous. We are so grateful for the amazing service. This company goes above and beyond to send a text with your technician's name, photo, and information. When someone is coming to your house late in the evening, it is comforting to know. Thank you!</review>

After using Ray O. Cook for a summertime emergency repair, I signed up for their annual maintenance package and just had my first service appointment. Joe was the technician assigned to my call. I received an automated text reminder and a call from Joe when he was on his way.  When he arrived, he was masked and used foot booties before coming into my home. Joe was friendly AND thorough.  I'm so glad I signed up for the annual maintenance with Ray O. Cook!<//Review>

I was at work while the inspection was performed & felt comfortable with Sonny in my home with my Family. I was sent a profile of Sonny before he arrived to assure he was solid & reputable.

<text>I have never written any reviews about a company before, but I had to do this for Ray O. Cook. My A/C unit went out during the last heat wave. I contacted Ray O. Cook for an estimate for a new unit. Danny was the sales person to arrive, and he was awesome. He was extremely knowledgable and thorough in his evaluation of my entire system. I really felt the job was going to get done right. Almost two weeks later Randy, Jose, and Hedayatullah arrived at my house. These guys have a great work ethic, and are extremely pleasant to be around. They took two days installing the new AC unit. The unit was tested to ensure it was performing well. I overheard the inspector compliment the installers on how well the unit was installed. Randy, Jose, and Hedayatullah took care of the little details, which I never expected. They cleaned up and left the place better than when they arrived. They even used touch up paint around the new thermostats and attic access. Danny was nice enough to send a thank you note after the install. I can't say enough about this company. I will not even consider using another HVAC company after my experience with them. Thanks guys. -Chris-< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Eddy and Chris were on time for an early appointment to replace the coil on the AC system. They were friendly, efficient and professional in their work. In little over an hour they buttoned up and left. While only a valve malfunctioned, Cook offered to replace the entire unit for the same price. It was a Rheem, only 5 1/2 years old and barely out of warranty. My wife and I are very pleased and the system is working great in the heat of early summer. We're cool and comfortable!!</Review></record>

Ray O. Cook is the best company I've worked with...ever! I wish all vendors and contractors were like them. They are very knowledgeable and professional. They show up when they say they will and are always friendly and respectful. Patrick has been to my home a couple of times for HVAC tuneups and he is extremely thorough, explaining everything he does. He is also very nice and completely respectful. You won't be sorry if you hire this company!</text>

Sonny from Ray O. Cook Heating and Air provided stellar service to my family. Our AC went out days before we were to have family visiting from out of town. Sonny went out of his way to get our AC back up and running and to see that my family was comfortable in this California heat. He took the time to explain everything he was doing and why. He also took the time to provide us with tips on how to more efficiency out of our unit. Sonny was very professional, friendly, and curtious. I totally recommend Ray O Cook and Sonny O.< /Text>

<GmapID>0x809b206d92606c81:0x8094daa431731679</GmapID><review>I'm new to California and my neighbor uses rayocook. Luckily I was not in an urgent situation and was able to get 5 different quotes. This negative review doesn't have anything to do with the ladies at the front desk who were professional, helpful and a delight to talk to.

I called in July 2020 bc I suspected there's an issue with my ducts and was looking to having them sealed. The first tech Patrick was very nice and helpful but didn't look at the ducts. I called the company and they sent a salesperson Paul who popped his tablet in the attic and this was the duct inspection. He said the ducts were fine but I should change my furnace and AC for $17K however although the ducts were "fine" he did quote $7K to REPLACE the entire duct system too. The reason to spend over $20K replacing everything was bc it's "old". I mentioned I just bought the home less than a year ago and was planning to sell soon and his comment was "oh so you're planning to pass the buck to someone else." If the units work still, I don't think they should be replaced but serviced. After that meeting I had an unproductive conversation with mgr Zach and the co sent a 3rd person Sonny to look at the hvac system. I bought the $150 program to get 2 tuneups per yr. In October Sonny came back and I sensed an attitude from him like I was wasting his time. He lectured me about the filter being "filthy" which I had changed a couple months before and said that I would "be calling them at midnight on Christmas Eve to have it repaired," I was standing nearby and he made a snarky remark that I could video tape him too. Sonny did not complete the tune-up and left upset which was shocking. He said he'd email me results and instead this company emailed a "got a klinker" message.  I found a great company that in the first visit they OFFERED to look at the ducts, took tons of pics, found that the ducts were not sealed and leaking causing the filter to get dirty.  Sooo professional...im hiring service champions for this and when it's time to replace, I'll be calling them. Rayocook said they couldn't touch the ductwork unless they replace the furnace and a/c. I have metal ducts that last forever and they wanted to replace them with the new soft ducts that need replacing every few years. All companies need to make money but some companies do business honestly. rayocook was the only company I gave a negative review from this research.<//review>< rating>

<text>This is my first time using this Ray O. Cook and I'm really impressed!  We've been using Sierra Pacific from installation to annual service and I was over them insisting that checking how well the heater works is best done towards the end of the season and vice versa.

Clyde K was professional, friendly and efficient. He went over what was checked and how our unit did with precision and clarity.<//text></record>

I  highly recommend Technician SONNY for his professionalism, his work ethic, and knowledge in explaining the situation. SONNY is the only technician I want to work in my house, who's familiar with my a/c & furnace
set up and what work has been done before.  Experience counts a lot.
SONNY deserves 5 stars; the company, 3 stars.< /text>

Ray O. Cook was able to respond the next day to our service request.  The technician arrived on time and found the trouble right away.  He wore gloves and a mask and respected the social distance requirement too.  The pricing was reasonable and fair.  We will definitely call them again for service and repair to our HVAC!< /Text>

The technician that did our inspection (Clyde) was very professional and conscientious about wearing his mask, during this Covid19 pandemic. Clyde was very thorough on doing his job and making recommendations and helpful. This is our first time of doing business with Ray O. Cook heating & air and I would recommend them to people we know and family members.

<Text>We were referred to Ray O. Cook by our next door neighbor.  We had another heating and air company here nine times in two months.  Each time the furnace immediately quit working again.  Ray O. Cook Service Technician Pablo G. came and performed several diagnostic tests the other company had never done, finding three major issues with our very old system, and showing me what the problems were.  In the end, we decided to replace the system due to its age.  Ray O. Cook was able to install the complete new furnace and a/c system two days later.  Installation Techs Rick T., Dave M., and Kris T. were all very personable and knowledgeable.  They worked together well and kept me informed along the way as the job progressed.  When they were done, they did an excellent job cleaning up.

The previous company gave me a six hour service window each time they had to come back, which was absolutely ridiculous given how many times they had been here unsuccessfully addressing the problem.  Ray O. Cook gave me a two hour service window, sent texts with a picture of the technician that was on the way, along with a description of his work experience.  The technician(s) called each time to let me know they were on the way and how long they'd be.

I highly recommend Ray O. Cook for any heating/air needs!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>San, the service technician, was very professional. He called me prior to his arrival so I knew when to expect him. He also sent a text with his picture and a paragraph about his experience so I could identify him when he csme him when he arrived. He greeted me and introduced himself. He was considerate and wore paper booties when he worked in my house on the furnace. San went over the bill with me; he explained about any rebates that I was eligible for in Roseville.  He  explained to me how to obtain the  information for getting a form for the rebate. He was conscientious and did the job that he was hired for. San also went over  his findings with me and explained the alternatives for correcting the problems with the AC. He actually showed me the part of the AC causing the problem and not just told me about it. San did a very thorough job. I was very satisfied with his work. I think he's a competent and knowledgeable service technician and an asset to  Ray O. Cook.< /review>< username>

< Review>
I usually never post poor reviews and I am sure that no customers will see this but it is for your staff. I am part of you club and I pay your company around $1000 per year just for this. I have two systems so I thought I was a valued customer. I am sure that I am just the complainer whenever I call into your office. I tried to use your company to get the heater for one of my systems repaired. Sixteen days and it is still broken so I have had to bring out another company to fix the system. I know it doesn't matter to you if my system is working but I have family members depending on me to get this fixed. A tech diagnosed the problem Nov 10th and I finally got a tech out here last night and he could not complete the repair because he said the part was bad. I was told the long delay for this repair was to get a new part shipped to their office but their tech told me the part has been available for a long time and it was my fault that the service was scheduled so late. OK, my fault I was waiting for the time that your office representatives said the part would take to arrive.  Then after he leaves, I get this eval to rate your performance - well it is not great. Finally, I get a copy of the invoice for the repair emailed to me after he leaves.  I am supposed to get a discount for being a member of their club but the math on their invoice is incorrect. It is not even subtracting the club member discount. Wow - epic fail all around.</Review>

<text>Tried charging me triple the average repair cost for a part that didn't need to be replaced. Didn't even know the system was out of refrigerant. Repairman was more interested in signing me up for a Service Contract than fixing my A/C unit. Had the repair done for 60% less money.< /text>< Response>

Great service, communication and professionalism!  We came home after the first day of a two day job and didn't care for the location of the condensing unit.  We felt it was just too big to sit on our patio right outside our kitchen window.  That evening we contacted Danny, the sales rep,  and he got in touch with the installation manager who informed his crew about our concern.  The next day the crew immediately began relocating the unit to an area around the side of the house where it was a much better fit.  We couldn't even enjoy our patio before when the AC was running due to the noise from our previous unit.  Now you can't even hear the new unit which is only five feet away from the original location!  Very happy to have a much more efficient and quieter system that we can enjoy for years to come!  Thank you to the entire Ray O. Cook staff and crew!< /text>

<Review>San Saechao just left my home after servicing my heater.  I have used many companies in the past and this was by far the best service and experience I have ever had.  San was very professional, knowledgeable and also patient with the questions I was asking.  He took the time to educate me on the proper use of my dual heating system.

Based on my experience with San, I will definitely recommend Ray O. Cook Heating & Air to my friends.  I asked for business cards to follow through to do that.

<Text>Had checkup on AC system by Clyde K. from Ray O. Cook Heating and Air company. Very knowledgable,  effecient, and professional. Took time to explain procedures, answer any questions during checkup, and discuss results clearly.

3rd visit, great experience.  This time Patrick came by, was early, finished on time, and took time to explain what was going on, showed photos, and was a friendly person.  Winning combination in my book. Furnaces are like tires on a car, they should just work.  These guys make the days when they dont work not such a nightmare.  Friendly and fast.<//text>

Two days later, Auburn weather went from hot to cold/ rainy. During weekend, put furnace through it's paces and it ran perfectly. Again, thanks to Pablo for both his "excellent" H/A repairman skills and, friendly manner too. Thanks also, to Ray O. Cook's office staff, too.

Thanks to their commercial I hired them for an inspection for just $59. Cheaper than other Heating & Air companies in Sacramento. Keep up the great work Rayo Cook!👍😊<//text>< Rating>

Ray O. Cook Heating & Air has been doing maintenance for us for several years.  Last year we needed and had them install a new furnace and air conditioner.  Recently we added  an APCO-X air treatment system ( have a lot of allergies).  We couldn't have had better service.<//Review>

Ray O Cook and Company replaced my heating and air conditioning system in 2015.  I have them come regularly to service it.  First of all, the previous system was put in by Beutler, I was never able to heat or cool my home.  It finally broke after only 11 years of service and had to be replaced.  Ray O Cook brought duct system up to code as well.  My utilities have gone down about 40% and my home is heating and cooling.  Each service person that has been sent out has been great.  I would recommend them without any reservations!!< /Text>

Short version: Basically a no-call, no-show for my maintenance/service appointment.  I called 30 mins after my appt time window (2-6pm) closed and was told I could wait another hour and maybe someone would come by, or I could re-schedule.. no one called me ahead of time to let me know what was going on.  If someone would have called and given me a heads-up in a timely fashion, this would not have been a big deal, I would have been OK w a re-schedule.. but to wait around the house for hours and not get one was upsetting.

I was quite hopeful of a good experience with this company as the initial communication was great - confirmation email and text, and the same for notifications when the actual appointment time came.  The earliest appointment was over a week for away from my initial call, but this was just for annual maintenance, so no big deal there.

On the day of my appointment, I call and leave a voicemail at the office letting them know that I will be around and available earlier in the day if that works vs the later 2-6 pm appointment time.  I get a call back 30 minutes later and they leave a VM stating that they are booked up and they "guarantee my appointment between 4 and 6 pm" (their words).

I busy myself around the house until 630 pm and give the office a call again.  The woman I speak to states the technician is still at the first place he went to this afternoon, but should be done sometime soon.. they have been slammed since a heatwave a week or two ago.  And it is a Saturday, so they only have one technician on.

I ask why no one called me to let me know that my "guaranteed" appointment time would not be kept.. there is only one technician to keep track of..  No good answer provided.

She asks me if I want to just wait for another hour or so to see if the tech can come by then.  I decline and say please just cancel my appointment.  She is apparently surprised by this answer and then states something to the effect of: oh good, the technician can go by someone's house w a broken AC then.. apparently oblivious to the fact that I am quite dissatisfied with this whole experience and wasting my afternoon waiting around for someone that never showed up and didn't bother to even call.

Perhaps this is just an isolated incident, but if there are other stories like mine up here on Yelp/Google, then maybe try someone else for your HVAC needs.  Another tip that I wish I was told earlier, is that they only have 1 technician on weekends - you may have better luck on weekdays?</Text>

We have enjoyed 2 service calls at 2 different residences in the past week. Both technicians (Steve and ?) were both friendly, professional and efficient. They were able to answer my questions and make affordable recommendations for needed work. In addition, I got a return call from Rory (Service Manager) who was able to give me valuable information about a thermostat replacement.  A big thank you to the team!  I highly recommend Ray O. Cook!</text>

I scheduled a winter checkup with Ray O. Cook to ensure my heater was functioning for the Fall/Winter season.  It was easy to schedule and I was able to get an appointment the next day.  The service technician, Patrick arrived within the two hour timeframe he was scheduled.  I have a prepaid maintenance plan so there was no further charge for this service.  Patrick did identify a problem with soldering that was wearing out on a circuit board.  It didn't need to be replaced at this time, but may eventually fail.  I recommend having Ray O. Cook inspect you A/C and heating system to ensure it's maintained properly.  Their technicians are well qualified and their prices are competitive.< /text>

<date>1566065768318< /date><rate>5<//rate><Text>Sonny came out to help diagnose an issue with the central air, he was extremely professional and easy to talk to. He helped figure out the issue, gave a fair estimate for the next steps, and got a temporary fix in place. Explained everything well and was willing to describe the issue technically, which was appreciated!

They were a little later than the estimated window (~15 mins), but they did call to let me know (both Sonny and from the main office.)

Will be using Ray O. Cook for my future central air issues for sure.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Sonny is an awesome tech! He came out on Sunday, took his time, thoroughly explained every step of the process, and got to the bottom of the problem quickly.  On top of it all, he found a potentially deadly carbon monoxide issue and quickly addressed it. I would have Sonny and Ray O. Cook out again!!!< /text>

I had seen good reviews online for Ray O. Cook so I decided to give them a try for a broken air conditioner.  I was very pleased with the punctuality, courtesy, competence, and business practices.  The senior technician, Thomas, had to stay at our home for an extended period due to some issues, but they don't charge extra for labor.  The labor is included in the visit price and the equipment prices.  So there were no pricing surprises.  I plan to continue using them in the future.</Text>

Technician, Chris is professional and sold me the maintenance plan after he cleaned the burner on my furnace and set-up the stats by computer. He also said he could be back over the weekend to install a part. He shows interest in me as a client and that he will work with me because the furnace is adjacent to a rental which will be occupied next week. Thanks for good service, Chris!</Review>

<review>After a very frustrating run in with another company, one that we had used for over 20 years, I called Ray O Cook company, as I had no heat. They immediately gave me the option of having a tech out after hours or next day.  I choose to have an appointment this morning (Saturday). I received both an email and text confirming my appointment.  This morning, I received a text and email stating that the technician was on his way and it included his name and photo (Pablo Gonzalez).  Not long after, I receive a phone call from Pablo letting me know he would be arriving within 10 to 15 minutes.  Once I explained what the problem was, he immediately set to work identifying the issue.  I don't think it was even 10 minutes later that he came in and said that someone had turned main gas valve off on the unit and asked who had last serviced the HVAC.  I let him know we had the coils replaced on the unit last May, as they were under warranty.  So...no heat all winter evidently.  Bottom line, Pablo is a wonderful young man.  He is courteous and very helpful.  Signed up for their annual service contract.  We will not be using anyone else again.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><GmapID>0x809b206d92606c81:0x8094daa431731679< /GmapID>< resp>

Bobby T. and Eddie M. gave us a call before their early-morning arrival (to avoid the heat of the day in the attic), put down tarps to protect our hardwood flooring, and quickly completed installing a new part on the AC system.  They tested the system, answered all our questions, and adjusted some vents to improve airflow to two rooms.   Highly recommended.< /review>< pics>

We have never worked with Ray O Cook before, but a neighbor recommended them to us after another heating and AC company came out charged us for a service call and did nothing. WOW what a great experience with Sonny!!! He called before he came, he was on time, very professional and considerate when he entered our home. He asked us what was going on and we explained the issues we were having. Sonny then suited up and crawled under our house (yuck)! He assessed the problems, took videos to show us what was going on and then presented solutions. He was extremely knowledgeable, thorough and very detail oriented. He was able to fix the immediate issues on the spot.  He then proceeded to let us know about a whole array of options for us moving forward. We ended up signing up for the annual service program and will ask for him in the future. If you want a true professional who is honest and a straight shooter, call Ray O Cook and ask for Sonny. 10 stars!!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Sonny was on time and did a great job explaining what the service would entail. The job was completed in the estimated time.  He pointed out an inconsistency in the system perhaps caused by the original installers and rerouted a water line that was causing a backup into my A/C's coil.  I was very satisfied with the work performed.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< name>

As always, the service from Cook's was excellent.  We appreciate the checkup of our new system, which is working very well.  Steven was here on time and did a thorough job of  making sure everything was running properly.  Many thanks.</review>

<text>Sonny did my annual heating check and did an excellent job finding and resolving problems.  Biggest issue was cold air circulating in my home
and a longstanding issue in the MBR.  I have smart vent, so the air circulate year round even after turning it off.   He found the correct red wire to turn the air off and on, so it was decided to do it manually, turning off the air now and back on in the Spring.  He is very knowledgeable and has great personal relations with his customers.   He is a keeper.<//text>< Pictures>

My first contact with Paul McHugh was knowledgeable, thorough & informative.  He explained every step & results  of the inspection of the A/C & Furnace. He took as much time as I needed to explain what would be done.  Especially, the choices in thermostat.  Finances were clearly explained including what discounts I could receive.  The installation was scheduled just two days later, which was great!

The installation crew, headed up by Dave Maxey, arrived promptly at 7a.  Dave was friendly & explained how the installation process would occur.  His crew, Rick, Ryan & Nick were all very polite & friendly.  Ryan, the duct inspector was also friendly & explained what he would be doing.  The entire installation went smoothly & was complete by 4p.  Excellent job!
Dave wrapped up the day explaining the  thermostat, reviewed what maintenance would be done in the future.

Thank you for an excellent job!</Text>

First of all, I liked it that was able to get an appointment the same day that I requested one. Our air conditioning system was leaking into the floor and under the house. My technician  Steve Pegueros was right on time, in fact  he  had even called to see if he could come a few minutes early , which was great.

He worked in a  professional and efficient manner while maintaining a very friendly demeanor. He figured out the problem, which was just a clogged water line, and was able to get the problem remedied quickly. I felt that the service fee was very reasonable.
This was my first time to use the Ray O. Cook company  and I was impressed enough that I will  call them again the next time I have any problem with my heating or air-conditioning</review>

Long time customer. They did my install which was done on time, on budget and to the highest standards. I remain in their twice yearly inspection program. Always good service and I sleep well at night knowing that my heating and air system is in top running condition.< /Review>

Honest opinions about our older AC unit and timely work performed.  Thomas was a professional through and through.  He told me all the flaws with my 14 year old unit and submitted options for replacement.  He did not push any agenda, but instead kept us informed on our system.  Would highly recommend this company.<//review>

The service was comprehensive, thorough, and efficiently performed.  At the conclusion of the service, Sonny provided a very good review of the tests that were performed and the condition of our units.  Well done, Sonny!</Text>

San Saechao, HVAC technician, serviced my heating system on February 26, 2020. He contacted me 30 minutes prior to my scheduled appointment time and arrived on time. He was courteous and professional. He thoroughly checked my system and explained the two step heating process. This company installed my new HVAC system in 2016. I have used their services repeatedly before and after my install. They are a trustworthy legit company with great customer service and a dedicated staff. I recommend them for all your HVAC needs.</text>

<text>Recently bought a home in Roseville, love the home but was not thrilled with the outdated thermostat. Family and I were irritated our system had an auto cycler that cycled cold air throughout the day and we could not turn it off. I reached out to The Ray O Cook Heating and Air company online, I was called within minutes and was able to setup an appointment for the following day. I was given a window of 4&6pm, Sonny called me shortly after 4pm to let me know he'd be arriving within 15-20minutes. Sonny was very thorough with his Inspection and diagnostic, he took photos of my HVAC system and explained in detail what was going on with the thermostat. I was already planning on replacing the thermostat but I was pleasantly surprised when Sonny informed me he had thermostats available for  installation. I did not feel pressured to make a decision right away which was nice. I got my husband on the phone and discussed wether or not we wanted to buy from a hardware store. We decided to go with Sonny's suggestion.  I'm very greatful, it's currently 7pm, Sonny just left and we have 2 new thermostats and NO AUTO AIR CYCLING. I'm very pleased with Sonny and Ray O Cook Air. We will be using them for now on for our HVAC needs.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I had problems with my heating /AC system because my monthly bill had skyrocketed over the last couple of months. The technician was very knowledgeable and quickly found the source of my problem saving me thousands of dollars. I highly recommend using this company if you experience problems with system.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate><userid>115737248344996929876<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<review>Dane was outstanding, courteous, up front, and even laughed at my jokes.  He is a keeper for the company and I hope he is available for my A/C checkup come Spring.  Dane, thanks for such a positive experience.

Patrick has become my favorite technician and I feel he does a great job, is courteous, takes time to explain issues, and seems incredibly qualified and efficient...I will want him back for Spring A/C inspection.</review><user>108365447312398320970< /user>< gmap_id>

Called at 06:45 AM to leave a message that I had a non-operating air conditioner, to my surprise "Lindsey" answered the phone from her car as she was on her way to the office and stated that she would call me back when she arrived at the office. That was a pleasant surprise, "Casey" returned my call and set up my appointment for service between 12:00 / 2:00 PM.  "Joel" the service tech showed up at 1:20 PM as promised and repaired my A/C.  Ray O. Cook performance and customer service is 5 STAR they perform as promised.  I am very satisfied with their service.
Sincerely

Super knowledgeable and prompt service as promised. Appreciated the call to let me know they were on their way as well. Unlike some of the larger heating and air companies we've dealt with, there was zero upsale or pressure to purchase anything.

Came out for our routine service and got amazing service like last time. Love the new feature with the email saying who's coming and a little about them! Keep rocking it!< /text>

Terrific job on the installation.  Bobby and  Dave did an outstanding job as far as my wife and I are concerned.  When they left, it did not look as if anyone had been working inside the home all day.  Thank you, fellows.  But to be fair to all, two members of the family were not impressed - Annie and Leo were confined indoors, and not too happy.  Woof!  Thank you folks!</Review>

They were recommended by our commercial heat & air company.  They installed a new unit in our home and they service our two heat & air units.  They are great.  Responsive & courteous.  They come on time and do a good job.
Continued bi-annual support is great.<//Review>

First time Customer and very pleased with the company! First sonny was on time and courteous, wore his bootees inside even when I told him it didn’t matter, went right to work and did his job! He was very informative about all of the a/c parts that I don’t know anything about! He checked the efficiency of our a/c and cleaned the condenser (showed me how so it I could do a better job) and found a broken wire in the blower compartment(don’t no what it’s called) and even helped me with my thermostat,after all that checked the efficiency again and was considerably better so as far as I’m conserned it was worth every penny and Ray O cook has a customer for life! Thank you sonny and Ray o cook!</Review>

Wish I could have had the experience that others had but it started out with a call from the technician stating he would be to my home at approximately 8:15 am.  I waited and called their office @ 8:45 asking where the technician was, the receptionist transferred me to a manager and he then stated that his technician had been there and no one came to the door. I then asked him did he ring the door bell, no he said he just knocked, well knocking I can't hear upstairs therefore my entire appointment was cancelled. The technician left a note on my door sorry we missed you.  No I was there, knocking when you have a 2 story home doesn't work the door bell does.<//Text>

{'time': 1524871046735, 'text': "Hi there, we are sorry your experience was not up to the standards we strive for. Our technician reached out to you on his way and left a voicemail, and upon arrival he did knock on your door. It is company policy that we knock and do not ring the doorbell as most of our customers prefer that. The technician then waited outside your home, reached out via phone again, then had our office reach out as well, with no luck getting an answer. He did then knock again, without answer. At that point after multiple attempts to contact you and reach you, we were unsuccessful and had to move forward. We didn't know if something may have come up and you had to tend to an emergency, or had forgotten the appointment. Without being able to reach you we were unsure. Once we heard back from you we did offer to come back the same day, later in the afternoon, which did not fit with your schedule. Should you decide to allow us to try again, please let us know and we can get something on the schedule for you at a time that works best for you.\nThank you"}<//response>

Ryan W. is very professional, caring and friendly.  He checked my furnace thoroughly with the checkpoint list and explained in detail what he did and weaknesses that I will need to look out for in the future.  Since my furnace/heating unit is 13 years old and I was quoted @ $12,000 for a new unit, that seems awfully high.  When I need a new unit, I will be honest and check around for a better price of which I hope you will be able to match.  Overall, I have been pleased with Cook's service.  Ryan explained things so well, I told him that he could be a teacher in the public education sector.  Thank you.< /Review>

I would like to take a moment to amend my negative review of Ray O Cook, I just received a call from my mother and Ray O Cook has done right by her!  I would specifically like to thank Jeremy (Service Manager) for your help in resolving this situation; he was wonderful to deal with.  Not many companies these days are customer service oriented; I have to say they took the time to listen and understood the situation.

I MIGHT CALL KURTIS!!!  My mother called Ray O Cook on Monday June 27 as her AC was not working, she was told when she called there would be a $65 diagnostic charge.  They were to be there between 2 and 4 my mom received a call around 3:45 that they were running late the tech showed at 5:10.  He went out looked at the AC unit, came back in and stated it was a blown dual run capacitor and it would be $199 for the service and the parts were under warranty.  She had it repaired and the total bill came to $264 (from start to finish he was there for a total of 20 minutes).   I called Ray O Cook today and told the young lady my AC went out and how much would it be she told me $65 diagnostic charge and the diagnostic fee would be waived if I had the service done.  When I called to complain about my mom's bill the young lady stated she told my mom the diagnostic fee would be waived if the bill was $249 or more.  My mom stated she never said that and I have to believe my mom as they never gave me an amount for the fee to be waived.  SO BEWARE OF THEIR CHARGES.  I am considering calling "Call Kurtis" as I feel they were dishonest in their explanation of fees to be charged.  I truly believe my mom deserves her $65 back.< /text>

My husband and I can't even do him justice in this review. He spent time with us to educate us on the various aspects of our heating and air system and how to run it efficiently. Then he thoroughly tested the system to make sure everything was working properly. We were really impressed that he went the extra mile and made several adjustments that greatly improved our air flow -- he even went to every vent in the house (with our full prior approval) to bend them slightly to direct the air better! He was wonderful!  We hope that he's the one that's sent out for all our future service checks. Thank you!<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>Mike T. Was very professional, arriving on time and explained everything to me as he went along.  He had no problem with me looking over his shoulder as he worked and also provided some excellent money saving tips.

After watching him check and service the heater unit while explaining each components function, it just confirmed to me that being a Cook club member is money well spent.

<text>I needed to replace my 23 year old HVAC unit.  I did the research.  I got other quotes from other companies for a new unit.  Ray O Cook's quote was right in the middle.  But their knowledge and customer service is what pushed them to the top of my list to replace my unit.  I highly recommend this company  to either service your AC and furnace or if you are shopping for a replacement.  I promise you will not be sorry we chose Ray O Cook Company.</text>< Pics>

Steve Brown did a very thorough job servicing the air conditioning system in my home.  He was knowledgeable and friendly and did a great job explaining all of the items that he checked and possible future issues to watch.  He pointed out - nicely - that I had not changed the filters in my house in a year (Yikes) and even wrote down the size I need to purchase.  I feel confident that the air conditioning system in my home will keep me cool for the rest of the summer.<//Review>

< Review>
Called at about 4:00pm on Monday, with a problem re-programming my thermostat and couldn't get the air compressor unit to go on.  I spoke with Maureen.  She was patient and kind  and professional, as I explained the problem to her.  She said if I couldn't resolve the problem with the manual or customer service, to call her back in the  morning and she would see what she could do to get someone out to my home. I called a little after 8:00am Tues. Maureen said she remembered talking to me, put me on hold and said someone could come out between 3-5pm today.  At about 3:15, the Service Technician, Sonny called and said he was 20 minutes away.  He was friendly, efficient, explained everything to me and answered all my questions.  He fixed the problem waited to make sure the compressor was up and running, added some insulation to the pipe where the freon goes, on the unit.  He showed me how my vents could be better positioned, got on a stool and fixed a couple so the cool air would blow in more efficiently in kitchen.  I will be signing up for the two yearly maintenance plan in the fall. I can't say enough how impressed I am with Ray O. Cook and their representatives, and how happy I am to have a go to Heating and Air Conditioning company!<//Review>

<name>Norm Miller< /name><Review>I rely on Ray O Cook Heating and Air for all my furnace and air-conditioning needs. Their employees are reliable, well-trained, respectful and take the time to explain what is going on and answer all my questions. That is especially appreciated. Bryan Ibay is the service technician who completed the most recent inspection of my system. He was scheduled from eight A.M. to ten A.M. He called me just before eight to say he was on the way, then, arrived on time. He did not rush his inspection. Instead, he was thorough and deliberate. He is professional and courteous and presents himself and his company in a most positive manner. I would highly recommend Ray O Cook Heating and Air to anybody seeking a company dedicated to quality heating and air-conditioning service.</Review><Time>1517852114707< /Time><userid>104728061451464081686< /userid></record>

Great and trustworthy company.  Worked with Paul to help replace an entire HVAC unit in our home a few years ago and we continue to have them service both of our units.  Always giving advice on how to run our systems efficiently.  No sales pitches and they stand by their work.  Danny is our newest service tech and he's highly knowledgeable and professional.</text>

Have been a "club member" for two years and could not be happier with this decision. Every staff member from this company has provided excellent service. Robert C. has been to my home the last two times and he has gone above and beyond expectations on both visits. Incredibly polite, professional and informative. Ray O. Cook could not ask for a better representative for the company. I highly recommend this company!<//review>

<review>We had the unfortunate experience of our heater going out this winter.  We called Ray O. Cook Heating & Air.  Their service from start to finish was amazing.  Each and every employee is efficient, courteous and knowledgeable.  Install Tech Willie Daffern and his team came in to replace our heat/AC unit.  Willie thoroughly explained every step of the process so that we understood what was being done and why.  Great care was taken in keeping the job site clean.  The long and the short of it is, if you need any work or replacement done on your heating/AC unit, this is the company to choose.  Thank you Ray O. Cook and team!!!</review>< pics>

They were very polite and informative about heating and air, and about what they were going to do. I've read recently how 70% of all systems were improperly installed. Mine was and this is my third system. None of this has never been explained to me. They told me about all the things that were wrong and they fixed them. Then they had a third party come in and tested all the ducts for leaks. Valley Duct Testing did the testing and they were very informative and polite and explained everything they were doing. Ray O. Cook team were careful about keeping things clean and cleaned up after themselves. I highly recommend them.<//text><time>1462945458233<//time>< GmapID>

Wow!!! Our heater broke, the house was freezing, and we were told by a friend to call Ray O'Cook, and they were out here in a hour. Steve was your tech and he was amazing, supper friendly and obviously knowledgeable. Identified the problem in five minutes and had it fixed in ten. No up sale, no be, just good old fashion customer service. Highly recommend this company!< /text>

Installation was perfect. Our install technician, Willie Daffern, arrived on time and went right to work.
Willie was friendly and explained everything about our installation. He took time to answer any questions we had. He made sure that we were familiar with the thermostat and how to set it. He went over how the zoning system worked, what type of filters were best and how often to change them.
Our whole experience with Ray O Cook was wonderful from the first call to schedule an appointment for an estimate, to the estimate, to installation. Highly recommend Ray O Cook.</Text>

<Review>We were very impressed with the service provided by San Saechao. He was courteous, thorough, and clearly knowledgeable about the work he was doing.  Although our system is old and probably on it's last legs, he did all he could to ensure that we will have heat this winter.  We appreciated his willingness to set up an appointment for a free estimate from a member of the company's sales staff in case replacement is necessary sooner than later. We would highly recommend him and the company he represents to neighbors and friends.<//Review>< Pics>

I appreciated Paul's prompt arrival and efficient use of his time while in our home.
His extensive experience in the business made his  explanation as to why our current system was not working well  and his suggestion of what needed to be done for comfort efficiency were convincing.
Willie and Rick worked two full days removing our old system and installing the new.  They were always
courteous, respectful of our home ,  answered all of our questions, and left our property clean and orderly.
I highly recommend this company.  The workers are a credit to the Ray O. Cook name.< /Text>

Ray O Cook installed a new HVAC system in my home. They won the bid over 2 other companies on the strength of their bid and the presentation by Paul McHugh.
Bobby, Ryan and Brandon were the installers. They did a great job, and completed the entire install in one day. Very professional from start to finish.
Update 13 Feb. 2019 scheduled post-installation service was performed by Dane. He arrived within the scheduled window and spent a good 1/2 hour or so inspecting the unit. He was courteous and professional.<//text>

<Text>This company came to elderly parents house during one of the very bad air days when the Camp Fire was pouring smoke into the air.  The technician looked at my parents' furnace and declared it was putting out too high a level of carbon Monoxide and that the entire furnace needed to be replaced. Yet, none of the house sensors detected any issues IN the house.  So I decided to call two other companies and have them inspect the furnace. One found a capacitor that needed to be replaced and showed me the current readings, but said the rest of the unit was in good working order.  The other company found NO ISSUES with the furnace whatsoever.  We won't use Cook any longer. My opinion is the Cook technician was either not very bright or looking to take advantage of an elderly couple.  Call Bell Brothers before you consider Cook and Co.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Jeremy did just what he promised, he ordered a new fan motor while we were still under warranty and installed it for free.  Who could ask for more!!!  Jeremy and his fellow technician called us to let us know they would arrive within 5 to 10 minutes and then let us know when they arrived.  They went straight to work and finished the job in very sort order.  I was impressed with their professionalism throughout the process.< /Review>< response>

'The requirements we had for a new Heating/Cooling system were met and in some areas exceeded by Ray Cooks proposal. It was also well within the budget we had set aside for this project and more than competitive with other bids. Had several emails and a phone call from Teanna McCallister reminding me of the date and time of installation. The last email had the name and picture of the lead installer, Willie Daffern. Crew was on time, and Willie reviewed  the installation steps in advance. Everyone on the crew knew their roles, and by 9 am, the old system has been removed, with the new outside unit in place. When the new furnace unit was unboxed, a large dent was discovered in the front of the unit. A replacement was delivered within the hour! By lunch time all of the old system had been removed and hauled away.  By 3 pm the new installation  and testing of same by Valley Duct testing was complete. Prior to leaving, Willie Daffern gave us all of the manuals, reviewed the new Smart Thermostat with us, and had us all set up on our Smartphones.  A few days later we received the Roseville city permit application from Teanna with a reminder  to notify them when the city had completed the inspection, so that they could proceed with the rebate request forms for both the new smart thermostat ($100) and the new energy efficient Furnace/AC unit. ($400).  We also received a thank you card and gift from Ray Cook for our business. All of the crew were knowledgeable, professional, courteous, and as my wife said "cleaned up after themselves!"  It's been sometime since we've had a project go this smoothly with all of our expectations met or exceeded. It was truly a pleasure dealing with Ray O. Cook.< /review>

Steve Brown was a great guy! Fantastic customer service, friendly, knowledgeable; just like past Ray O' Cook technicians who have worked on my units in the past.  Steve was honest and forthright, I trusted his advice and thoughts on my aging unit.  Look forward to working with him in the future as  I pay for the Cook Club maintenance.  Thanks Steve!< /Text>

Five Star Experience. Just had a new 4-ton HVAC system installed which included fixing duct work that a previous company had installed wrong/poorly. This all started with a "tune up inspection" that found problems with our 13 year old Lennox.  We asked questions regarding repair of the Lennox unit  which were answered and when asked - were shown the actual problems.  Repairing the old system could have been done. We did some research on parts and repair work and decided that the best bang for our dollar and long tern use was to replace the Unit. We also checked prices on other companies/installers.  We then decided to continue with Ray O. Cook.  During the two day installation our inter-action with the staff was excellent.  They were polite, friendly and professional.  Extra work was done to correct the old duct work installation ensuring proper air flow.  The result - best HVAC system we have had.  Very happy and confident should any problems arise they will fix it.</review>

Very professional, polite, on time and did an excellent job.  Crystal does excellent job in Customer Service, always responds to questions, calls back and is pleasant to deal with at all times.  Thanks to Jeremy for resolving my sudden loss of A/C on a HOT day before the July 4th holiday weekend. Paul's presentation was informative, detailed and I was impressed with all the people involved with this transaction.  Willie and his coworker did their work in a very professional manner.< /Review>

Many companies make tall claims in their mission statements and promises of great service before selling their products. The real test is when something goes wrong after the product is delivered. My new AC stopped working after one of installation due a rare manufacturing defect. Ray Cook stood by their promise, and replaced the AC within 24 hours on a Saturday. These guys have earned my respect and I would most happily buy from them again.

<Text>Sonny came out to our property repair what a previous roofing company failed to do. He was friendly, polite, and professional. He didn't try to sell us anything we didn't need, but provided solutions to our problem. He spent a total of two hours at our place and was working hard the whole time. He filled the holes in our roof where we were having leaks, cleaned our air filters, showed us how to clean them too, and was patient with our questions. We would love to have him again.

Thanks Sonny!

The person assigned to troubleshoot my aircon gave me false diagnotics, and that’s not enough, he gave a overpriced estimate just to get it fixed. Just wow!! This need to stop.

I selected Ray O Cook based on the recommendation of a neighbor who had their HVAC system replaced by Cook.  Willie and his team arrived on schedule and  completed the entire replacement of our system  within the day.  They were real pros, everything went like clockwork and when the job was finished, Willie carefully went over the entire system, explaining all pertinent  equipment operation and all the necessary paperwork.  The work site was cleaner than when they arrived and the system works perfectly.  A big five stars for Ray O Cook and the craftspeople they employ.  This company is the real deal.< /Text>

The sales, service, and installation technicians are well trained, knowledgeable, and professional. The installation was very clean and equipment worked grwat.  The inspector said that the installation was impeccable and is unaware of any Ray O. Cook projects failing final inspections. Great job by the lead technician, Bobby Turlington.</text>

Thank you Ray O Cook and service rep. Armando Nuno for his services yesterday (1/25/2021).  Armando was prompt and did a very thorough job on our semi annual HVAC check up.  I would highly recommend Ray O Cook for any of your HVAC needs.  Ray O Cook installed a brand new HVAC system at our home two years ago and it has performed incredibly well for us.<//review>

The call came from the office of Ray O. Cook H&A reminding me that I had a free inspection on my contract, and would I like to make an appointment.  They also guaranteed a 2 hour window.  I loved not being tied down all day.  They called to remind me and the tech showed up on time, neat, friendly, clearly official and put on his little shoe covers.  After the inspection which he used an entire page of information to fill out; he went over all of the points, measurements and meanings to everything that he had examined.  He thoroughly answered all questions and made recommendations to help save money.  The entire experience was a pleasure from beginning to end.< /Text>

Before he inspected the furnance, he made sure to ask if I had any questions or issues. He answered my questions about filters and the thermostat. After examining my furnace, he showed me photos of the furnace to validate it was in good operating condition. He will order a filter for me and return to install it. He, like the other service technicians who've come to my house, is excellent. Very pleased with the quality of service!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

We bought a new heating and air conditioning system from Ray O. Cook .  Willie and Jose arrived on time each day (it was a two-day job) and worked diligently on all aspects of the job.  They were responsive to our questions, and were courteous and professional.  They cleaned up after themselves, a big job considering all the equipment that had to be installed and the adjustments that had to be made to the size of various vents.  All in all, we were very happy with their work, and would recommend Ray O. Cook to anyone who needed HVAC work done.  Very competent people.<//Text>

<text>Thank you, Sonny!  What a relief!! Our AC went out at the beginning of a heat wave.  We had a couple techs come out before to give a quote.  They said they could do a quick fix but couldn't guarantee the work and recommended a new system.  Sonny came out and confirmed it was a single part that needed replacing and the rest of the system still had some life.  You can trust to get an honest answer with great customer service from Ray O. Cook!! Thank you!!<//text><gmapID>0x809b206d92606c81:0x8094daa431731679< /gmapID><Time>1498315033612</Time><Rating>5</Rating>< user>

Willy, Rick, and Randy did a great job installing our new HVAC system.  They were on time, very polite, and kept us informed the whole time.  Additionally, they even completed the install a little early despite having to take a few extra steps to correctly plumb the gas line to the new heating system in the attic.

I would highly recommend Ray O. Cook for any HVAC work as all of our experiences with the company have been A+.< /Text>

<review>This company rocks, they showed up on time (actually early) very clean dressed, very professional. Was very careful of my home, vacuumed up every day, used drop cloths on floors. They even cleaned up the trash from the attic that was left from the prior company 19 years before..We're very organized in the process. Eric was the lead foreman had EVERYTHING in control. Zander & Brett were just working away all the time. The system worked perfect when started. I feel I made the right decision by using RAY O COOK .....

I have spoken to my service manager and the technician who was on site to see where we could have done better.  From the look of the notes it appears you installed a furnace and coil but could not get it to run.  My technician found a bad primary control board bad with water stains on it. We did provide you an estimate to replace the board but you denied us to do the work because the primary control board was not on our truck.  These control boards are and OEM specific part to that exact furnace so we cannot stock them.  The reason we could not guarantee it would work was because without the control board in place and working we would not know if there was other water damage to other electrical components.  I apologize that my technician was unable to communicate this to you on site.'}</response>< UserId.>

<rating>5</rating><Text>It was the first 100+ day (106) of the season. EVERYONE  turned their AC on and MANY people found that it didn't work!!! So I called Ray O Cook. My HVAC company. Crystal calmly explained their situation and that getting service that day was not going to be possible. But if anything opened up she would call me. We talked several times that day. Working with Crystal was wonderful. She was very professional, friendly and made me feel like I was her main concern and that she really cared about ME. Working with Crystal was wonderful in a bad situation.

DAVID BRAVO
The following day Dave, Service Pro, came to our home to check out the AC. I liked him with the first handshake. Very professional and great to work with.  He diagnosed the problem quickly and got right to work. There was a coolant leak. He  did a quick job of replenishing the lost coolant and finding and repairing the leak in the attic unit thus resolving the problem.
Thanks Dave, I will ask for you if there is ever another need.

Thank you,

At first, he said he would be able to get only one working and asked if I wanted downstairs or upstairs.  I said upstairs since that's where we sleep.  He was persistent to solve the problem and at the end, he figured out how he could get both working without having to come back.  He did an excellent job and I hope he is the one that comes back to do the maintenance check on our units in July.< /review>< pics>

They meet my questions easily and made sure I was comfortable about the process of install.  Paul had explained how my current system had left me with cold pockets in my house and the difference I would notice after the new HVAC system was installed.  I felt the difference immediately when the team did the final test of system. What a relief to have consistent warmth.  Paul was professional, honest and answered my questions.  He was very helpful in making my decision to go with Ray O. Cook for all my HVAC needs.  He did not up-sell me in any way.  I highly recommend this company.  Did I say 10 stars.</Text>< Date>

We had San Saechao, a service technician for Ray O. Cook Company, come today for a service evaluation of our air conditioner. We just moved into our 12-yr-old house late last year and had not yet used the air conditioner. What we saw when San replaced the filters shocked us. They obviously hadn't been replaced in a long time, were filled with crud, and were choking the A/C system. San replaced the filters, fixed a minor leak at the unit, installed a hard-start kit for energy efficiency, and then tested the system for overall performance.  San worked non-stop for almost 3 hours and our final bill was only $380. San explained all of his work, and was very professional.  We are very pleased with the professional HVAC services provided by the Ray O. Cook Company.<//review>

I was referred to Ray O. Cook a number of years ago and have always found them to be responsive and professional.  Steve Brown is no exception.  He was:
- on time,
-  friendly,
-  very competent,
-  spent adequate time to explain what he looked at, what he fixed, and my options going forward
- DIDN't try to oversell or pressure me

I joined the "club" today - it was a no-brainer.  Steve sold me by his actions and competence, not a sales job.

Thank you<//text>

Couldn't be happier with the service provided by Steve B. and the gang at Ray O Cook Heating and Air.  Steve was ontime and professional.  He took the time to go over everything with me so I completely understood what condition my unit was in.  No sales pitch or pressure to buy anything, just some suggestions on areas that might require some attention in the future so I could keep an eye on them.  This was not my first service with Ray O Cook HVAC and it won't be my last.  I have recommended them to several friends and relatives in the area who have also been very pleased with their service.< /review>

The customer service experience with technician San Saechao was great. He is knowledgeable and experienced in HVAC especially for someone his age. Also he didn't leave a big mess to clean up even though he had to go in the attic! His company also took care of the Roseville Electric rebate offer directly online. I didn't have to fill out any paperwork or wait for a reimbursement. Thank you San and Ray O. Cook.< /review>

Our service provider, Mike Tarabochia had excellent customer service skills and more importantly, was extremely thorough in explaining what our Amana system needs and how to make it run more efficiently in our home.  He is the best service provider we have experienced by far!!  We will be requesting him for our next service check up!<//review>

The staff and service people at Ray O. Cook are awesome. They installed a new HVAC last October. Everyone was polite, professional and they CLEANED up (not that they made a mess). They made sure I was happy and understood how to operate the new thermostat. Today San Saechao came to check my systems to be sure everything was running properly. San was thorough and made sure all my questions were answered before he left. I would recommend Ray O. Cook Company to anyone considering a new HVAC system or just need their current systems maintained.<//Review>

< review>
I recently got a house and all the initial inspection has been done through professional. They suggested me to do the tune-up of our heating system. One bad day I got special offer for $59 in my mail box for heating system tune-up from Ray-O-Cook. Although everything was working fine as inspection guy said I thought to go for the tune-up. Then I called Ray O. Cook Heating & Air and made an appointment.

They came and proceeded to do the inspection and I was so surprised he found several things that he said needed attention. I don't know what they did, but sure they gave me estimate of ~$1500 to fix all the things. Before they came system was working perfectly fine, but now my first floor heating is not at all effective. How the system can get worse after their visit until unless they might have done something wrong in their inspection process.

I tell you how their business model works, you will call them for the tune-up in $59 as in their ad. But that's not the way it works, you just pay for their visit and they will not do anything except telling you that your system requires thousands of dollars repair. If you are willing to pay then its good for them otherwise $59 are their with them for making the system worse as in my case.

Actually it was my mistake that I haven't done any research about them, if you see everywhere there are only bad reviews about them. I will not recommend this company to anyone. It's up-to you, want to make your system worse or want to do tune-up. If you really want to do tune up please don't call them.</review>

Yesterday we had an inspection/service done for a house my family is looking to buy.  Nick Scardina came out to do the job. He was very professional and knowledgable. The inspection/service went very well and he explained the process to me which was good. He made a couple of recommendations which I appreciated. The one thing that impressed me the most was the positive way he spoke about the company he worked for. I will continue to use Ray O Cook and hope to the opportunity to work with Nick again.</Review>

After deciding to upgrade our old HVAC to an energy efficient system, we called Ray O Cook. We called them first  because we had a great experience with the service representative who fixed our old unit. Paul the estimator was highly professional and honest about the system we needed. After meeting Paul, were sold with Ray O Cook and did not call any other vendor. The chief installer, Willie, and his crew were amazing. They were highly professional and highly trained to do the job right. This was a very big job (removing old HVAC from the roof and installing an attic based 4 ton system). It was a 4 day job. Willie stayed late every day and walked us through the project to show us the progress. Willie went above and beyond to make sure we had the best installation. He was courteous, professional, and went the extra distance every day to get everything just right. I would recommend Willie, Paul, and Ray O'Cook to anyone who wants to upgrade their system or just have service. They were terrific!</Review>

I did not have a good experience with this air conditioning company. The service guy was over two hours late and never called as they said they would. He seemed to be more of a salesman that a repair guy. I asked for the $59 tune up but got a bill for over $400. Not saying the work didn't need to be done but how would I ever know. My brother told me later that the billed seemed very high for what they did. Will probably use Angie's list next time I need service!< /Text>

The service I recieved from Ray O. Cook was top notch!!! I signed up for a quick tune up of my AC but threw Nick (my assigned technitian) a curve ball when I told him that actually the AC doesn't seem to work.  He quickly found the problem and even took the time to soften the blow of the costly repair, while expanding my relationship with the company.  Great Job!!!< /Review>

<text>Stay away from Ray O. Cook Heating and Air! Not only did they sell us a system that was way to powerful and expensive for our needs, but the system has continuously broken down (this is our 7th time!) . We came home from vacation yesterday (a Saturday) to find overheated pets (one is dying of kidney disease), and yet again, an A/C system that's not working. It's been 100+ degrees most of the week and even when we called their 24/7 Emergency service, the operators were told to not report any calls until Monday! This company is completely without morals or ethics. PLUS, YOU CAN'T LEAVE A POST WITH ZERO STARS!!! YOU HAVE TO LEAVE AT LEAST ONE STAR!! THE NERVE!!!!< /text>< pics>

<Text>I wanted to add to my last review about Danny P that he was so professional and thorough and he was the first one to recommend that I replace my unit.  He found that my dual zoning board was out as well as a capacitor out of specs and also that I needed 3 lbs of coolant.  He said that it's possible that my inside coils could be leaking.  I went ahead and paid for the coolant instead of replacing the unit at the time which now I regret doing since I've had more problems since then.  A month later Steve diagnosed that the main circuit board failed causing the internal fan to not shut off even when the thermostats were turned off and the heater fan was running as well.  Paul was able to get Danny to come out immediately to replace the main circuit board free of charge in order to stay cool until Ray O' Cook could replace the entire unit as recommended.  I know Danny was extremely busy that day and I really appreciated him coming out at the last minute.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>My 5 ton AC was 20+ years RUUD unit was old and the compressor broke. I invited 5 companies to provide with an estimate to replace the current system. Paul from Ray Cook came and measured the airflows and looked at the room sizes and recommended that I might not need a 5 ton unit and 4 Ton unit would be more than adequate to serve the rooms since the current return duct was undersized. He was very knowledgeable and explained the Rheem units technical design data and required airflows etc. to me. He gave me a detailed estimate and explained me the warranty information. Their price was not the lowest but was competitive. The installation team led by Eric came as scheduled at 7am and worked till 5 PM to install the whole unit, required duct work and got it inspected by HERS inspector the same day. The crew was very courteous and professional and completed the job on time in a very clean manner. The new system is working much more effective and much quieter. I will highly recommend them.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><user>101870524342294067457<//user><date>1506618681805< /date><Name>Atul Gupta< /Name></record>

<username>Rod< /username>< Review>
Personally, I have worked as a Hydroplant electrician for a number of years. When it comes to good quality work and HR skills its not hard to give the Ray Cook crew a 5 star rating.  Everyone from the Office staff to the install techs explained everything I needed to know and made clean work out of a messy project.  The estimator Paul McHugh was very professional. He showed exactly what equipment needed to be upgraded and where my bottlenecks were by expanding duct tubing from the intake air receiver and larger Master bedroom duct to balance temperatures evenly.  This increased efficiency allowed my new HVAC system to be reduced from a 4 ton to a 3.5 ton.  Also the Rheem HVAC is quiet compared to the old system. The outside condenser not only looks good but is larger, which should contribute to greater refrigeration action. Thanks again for your service.< /Review>

<username>Iris Ching</username><Time>1487760163283</Time><rating>5</rating><text>Jan . 2017-Recently, Steve B. did an excellent job remodeling our HVAC intake system. He did the job quickly and cleaned the area well afterwards. Steve is highly experienced and has great customer service skills. We definitely recommend Steve B at Ray O Cook company.

We highly recommend Ray O.Cook Heating and Air as your total HVAC company. Even though Mr. Cook has retired, the firm has continued his high standards of superb customer service using the finest products. Our HVAC was installed several years ago and has been maintained by their excellent technicians twice a year since (this keeps your system in great working condition and prevents many issues).

Jeremy E. took excellent care of us until recently getting promoted in this firm. So glad the company rewards and retains their best employees!

Recently, Mike T replaced Jeremy and I didn't have to worry about the level of service because they hired another very experienced and knowledgeable technician. Mike T has excellent customer service and technical skills. We like techs that share and educate customers on their systems to help maintain it. Please consider this company for all your HVAC needs!

This price did include our diagnostic services as well, not just the repair.  The repair was a chemical cleaning of the coil.  So there is a lot more involved than just hosing off the coil with a garden hose.  Also I did confirm on GPS and our technician was there a little over an hour not including travel time.  I am sure some of this confusion is due to that you were not able to meet us at your home and we were only able to meet with your room mate.  I am happy that we were able to get you up and cooling on this 104* day.'}<//Response><username>David Hansen< /username><text>They charged me $315 to use my garden hose and spray down my A/C.
