I have been getting my hair cut at PRESS for almost two years now and still come here after moving back to north Orange County because Vaan and her entire team CARE about how their clients look. It’s hard to find hair dressers that take the time to hear your suggestions out and do their best to implement what you’d like done, but I have found that everyone at PRESS genuinely desires to give an amazing cut tailored to each individual. I would highly recommend coming here!!<//review>

Anyone who can make my thin hair look as good as it does, must be not only a world class hair stylist, but a magician! If you want to look your best, get your head of hair down to Press Men's ASAP.

Its nice to go to a place where you can be sure they are going to take great care of you.. where you can walk out knowing you look good! The hot towel treatment on your face while they massage wash your hair is also very nice. I'll be going here regularly for my hair cuts. They do facial hair grooming also. Very Impressed.<//Review>

Been coming here shortly after it opened.

Love the decor and the stylists are great, but most importantly, the hot towel + scalp massages are to die for.
They are also very quick without sacrificing quality. I usually pop in during my lunch break and make it back to work with time to spare.

I've referred this place to some of my friends and they all loved it too.
If you haven't been to PRESS yet, I highly recommend you do so.
You will not be disappointed.< /review>

Vaan and her crew have been nothing but hospitable, kind, and most especially professional during all of my visits. I've always been very happy with my haircut and overall experience at Press! They keep the place orderly and clean plus have all the nice perks with shampoo service, hot towel, quick scalp massage, and proper rinse. Fantastic small business with even better people.</review>

The management, the receptionist all did a wonderful job on welcoming to Press, after finding them on google, Ciarra not only did a precise haircut but she also styled it on point. Most places in the area are a joke. But press has stylists that know mens hair.< /Review>

I have gone here a number of times for both a facial trim and haircuts. They never disappoint. I have always been very particular about how my hair is cut, wanting a certain look. From the first time I went, I was able to work with the hair stylist to come up with a plan for how I want my hair. Great service and good vibe to the place, but most importantly, I have always liked my haircut and have always been very satisfied.

<text>It's not "clubby" like some other men's salons, and that's just fine for me. I don't feel like I need to pay for flatscreen TV at every chair or mahogany booths. I just want a good haircut from a competent, friendly stylist. You can get that here.</text>< Time>

Ciara is very skilled and explained why certain styles and products work better for my hair length and texture.  I highly recommend her as a stylist.  She's way cool and fun to talk to which is a plus.</Review>

<text>PRESS is the best men's hair salon in OC. If you're looking for a high quality cut look no further than PRESS. I have been a client for over a year and I couldn't be more pleased.

Vaan offers personalized service while being incredibly efficient. She takes the time she needs to make sure you are satisfied with your cut while respecting your time.

I also enjoy the fact PRESS offers online scheduling of appointments. It couldn't be any easier to make an appointment.

I highly recommend PRESS Men's hair salon.<//text><UserId.>111217412825981446534< /UserId.></record>

If you just recently received a fantastic men haircut from a salon, and want to clean it up after 2-3 weeks, then Press Men's Hair is the place to do it at.  I love the haircut I received a month ago in San Francisco's Financial District, three weeks afterward, Press Men Hair was able to help me maintain that same haircut.  Ask for stylist Elysa La Valley< /Review>

Vaan has been cutting my hair for years and now has her own Men's Hair Salon. It's a very stylish salon and is a place a where a guy can feel comfortable, receive a great hair cut along with personalized service. Normally, you would need to go to more of a ladies salon to receive this kind of service and style. Now, we have a place to go to look great, feel comfortable and even catch up on sporting events with several flat screens tuned to ESPN. Nice!< /text>

<review>One word: awful. Either the shears were dull, or the "stylist" Denise is clueless how to cut as my head kept getting pulled around. Could not understand her because she was ditzy and her speech slurred like she was on something. Finally the hair was unevenly cut. It was so obvious but I didn't say anything as I lost all hope at that point. Went home, took a shower and got a repair cut at another better salon. Avoid!< /review>< userid>

<Text>This is a great mens hair styling place. It is easy to make an appointment on line. The place stays on schedule. The physical environment is pleasant. Most importantly, the stylists (Jill has been mine--see her, you will not be disappointed) seem to be very skilled, unrushed, listen to the customer, and cut the hair in such a way that it remains in good shape and easy to care for until the next session. Prices are reasonable. Since my hair cuts have gotten excellent reviews from those around me, I give Press an excellent review!<//Text>< Pictures>

We appreciate new clients such as yourself, however, we do work on a set schedule, often  with clients booked back-to-back. When you are running more than 30 minutes late for your appointment, it interferes with the next guest’s haircut time; therefore we have no choice but to offer you a new booking time. There is a fee applied to clients who do not show up to their scheduled appointment time. However, due to the fact that we have never served you before, we waived that fee.\n\nWe corresponded with you very clearly, professionally and in a timely manner.\n\nPlease contact me immediately if you need further assistance or have any questions regarding our cancellation policy.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nVaan Sheahan\nOwner\nVaanty@gmail.com'}< /response>

< Review>
I decided to try PRESS after moving to Orange County and reading great reviews about the salon.  Vaan did my first cut/style, and I was very impressed!  I have been visiting her every three weeks for the past year.

The most important factor for me is the quality of the cut.  I have never been so confident in a stylist as I am in Vaan.  I am always certain that she will deliver a great haircut exactly how I want it, and that the haircut will look amazing.  That feeling of confidence is priceless.

Other factors also separate PRESS from its competitors.  When you book an appointment, you are booking an entire experience.  The shop is always very clean and looks wonderful.  The staff members are all very friendly and welcoming; they offer you beverages when you are waiting.  The scalp massage is very relaxing.  And you get an entire 45 minutes all to yourself, so you can feel confident knowing that your stylist is giving you their undivided attention.  They use Bumble & Bumble products, too, which is a plus.  Overall, I always look forward to my visits to PRESS, and I cannot imagine going anywhere else.  I would definitely recommend that any guy give this place a chance!</Review>

Creative hair stylist, clean and high quality service, friendly environment, adequate prices, close proximity to my office.
Pretty much what I expect from a hair cut.< /text>

<Review>I was in the Irvine area in desperate need of getting a professional style for work and I stumbled upon Press Mens Hair. Wow, I got lucky! First, I was greeted with a smile and offered a beverage of my choice. Then I sat down and told the hair stylist (Vaan) to work magic and give me a professional look. I have never been as satisfied with a cut in my life. She was extremely enjoyable to talk with and I will return to her time and time again.<//Review>< Date>

Elysa is my stylist here at Press and she does an amazing job! I have been coming to Press for about 7 months and love this place! I used to go to 18/8 Salon and they just went down hill. I am very particular about how I like my hair to be cut and styled and Elysa was able to visualize what I explained to her what it is I want. Elysa is really sweet and always has great conversation while cutting my hair. She loves music and movies so the conversation is endless. This adds to the great experience of coming here to see Elysa at Press.< /text>

<review>Let me start by saying I am very picky when it comes to hair stylists. The reason why I am so picky is that my mom is a hair stylist and she has been cutting my hair for close to 40 years. Since I moved an hour away, I had to search for a hair stylist that is edgy, skillful, patient, down to earth, trend setter and someone I can trust.
After trying out different barber shops and salons, I finally came to PRESS men's hair. Walking into the salon, my first impressions of the place were that the staff was welcoming and customer centric. As I checked in, they offered me a refreshment. I was starting to love this place already.  You can totally tell that this place is made for men. My hair stylist was Vaan the Scissorhand and she immediately greeted me with warmth, and asked a few concise questions to determine exactly what I wanted.  I even showed her a picture and she knew exactly what I wanted. She took me to wash my hair and then gave me a scalp massage. Those spirit fingers were releasing all the tension and stress in my head. To top it off, she put a warm towel over my face and I love every moment of it. She immediately went to work on my hair. As the scissors approaches my hair, I can hear it say "just do me dirty."  We casually conversed throughout, and after 20 minutes, my hair was done.  I'll have to admit out of all the times when I go to barber shops, the stylist rarely gives me the look that I specifically had in mind.  But Vaan gave me a pleasant surprise when she finished with my hair looking nearly identical to what I originally had in mind.  She just works wonder with those scissors and her precision was on point. Let me tell you, this was one of the best decisions I've ever made!
Vaan is now the only person I will allow to put scissors on my hair. I am able to book my appointment online  and receive text reminder confirming my appointment. I usually come here on my lunch break and head back to work. I highly recommend PRESS men hair and this shop will definitely be my hair shop in the future! I am looking forward to my next appointment in a few weeks.</review>< Resp>

<review>I was lucky enough to meet Vaan about 8+ years ago and ever since, it has been 100% hairdresser monogamy.  Vaan provides topnotch style and service without the attitude and pretension of self-described elite/fashion salons.

Press Men's Hair provides a bright, clean, hip yet low key space to get your monthly mane-tenance.  The staff is friendly and professional.  With your haircut service, you can receive a complimentary beverage, a hot towel service, wash and style.

At this location, you know need to jockey for parking or deal with valet or a parking garage.

I don't want to get Vaan to busy where she cannot get me in last minute, but there really is no one else I would recommend so whole-hardheartedly!

Of course, the salon is staffed with lots of other skilled and awesome stylists.

Pro-tip:  book your rez online on their website...easy and hassle-free!<//review>< pics>

Visiting LA and went here with niece. Lady told me couldn’t use massage chair unless I paid $5 more and no hot towel on legs unless another $5. Indicated price was $25 or $30 no where did I see it posted. Also polish on three nails smudged bad after I left. Should have not tipped but I did. Turns out lady working on niece says it was $17 and Niece got to turn on massage chair, I got jilted.</review>

<Review>Timing:
from the moment I entered the salon and signed up as a walk-in and the moment when I left with gel manicure an hour passed.

Pricing:
Average, for my gel manicure I paid $28 plus tip

Quality:
Since we are in Los Angeles, I would say that the quality of work is average for this price, but if I were in Europe, I would rated very low. Although the manicurist was a pleasant and friendly lady, neat.

Would I come back here again ? Most likely yes, I live near ￼by< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb6f123d2f9b:0xb4c05bfbfc9d32e3< /Gmap_id><date>1572742141868</date><rate>4< /rate></record>

I'm a client of B & J Nails for 6 months, but what made me write this review was the cleanliness.  As I arrived early I could see and I think it is important nowadays for what we are living, COVID.  Susan is an excellent professional I only trust her to make my foot that requires attention.</review>

I got acrylics taken off here and had a horrible experience. I don’t often leave reviews online, much less bad ones, but my experience was genuinely awful. They didn’t soak them first, they just pulled them off. It really hurt, and when I expressed my pain to the nail tech, she flat out ignored me. I told her multiple times that it hurt, and she just kept yanking. Two of my nails broke in half, and all of them were badly damaged. It’s months later and my nails still haven’t grown out from the damage. I have naturally really healthy and strong nails, and now they’re constantly breaking.

The nail tech just seemed to be in a rush to get me out and wasn’t friendly aside from damaging my nails.

I hate leaving negative reviews, but I would honestly really avoid going here. My friend who I went with also had a bad experience.<//Text>

On Saturday my girlfriends and I all went in to get our nails done. I opted for a dip powder manicure and I love it! Efficient yet precise. My friends received treatments for gel, pedicures, acrylics, waxing etc and we all were very happy with the end results. We had an appointment but you can walk in and they’ll fit you in quickly!< /Text>

Third time here today and it was a wonderful experience! Tiffany did my gel manicure and she was amazing! Probably the best manicure I've had in quite awhile. She was super sweet and I will definitely be back and will ask for her regularly. I found them off of google and have already referred a friend! Also, I will say that making an appointment is the way to go over walking in.</review>

<Review>I got an acrylic fill and gel color from Ken. He was extremely careful and precise with his work. He also was very communicative about what my needs were. As a result my nails look amazing! He wrapped my hands in a warm towel after which was a nice extra touch. Will definitely be coming back here.<//Review>< pics>

<Name>Jennifer Collins< /Name><Time>1535156380363< /Time><Rating>2</Rating><Text>So I'm not from the area, but I expected what I consider to be a normal pedicure for back home. And home is Alabama. They literally had a foot basin of water that was BARELY warm and definitely cold by the time she was done. I was expecting the massage chair, foot tub with jets, etc. These chairs were in the shop, but not in use, I was definitely confused. Others had their feet in basins as well so I figured it was "normal". The nail tech was friendly and did a great job with polishing (thus why they got 2 stars). I was looking for foot and leg rubs and something more relaxing. This. Was. NOT. I honestly could've just asked for a toe polish because that's basically what it was with a cold water soak. Luckily I was only charged $13. Needless to say, I won't be back.</Text>< pictures>

Very friendly people that did a nice job. My only complaint is the door was open with no air conditioning on, and lots of street noise.<//review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I used to love this place they listened to what you wanted and made sure you were happy with your results. My most recent visit made me change my opinion entirely. They pushed me from seat to seat, pushed extra services before I had even picked a color or said what I wanted, then rushed through my nails did NOT even clean my cuticles, when I mentioned it along with not liking the color she acted like I was inconveniencing her not trying to help resolve the issue.  My nails look nothing like I asked for... and at the end got pushed out of my seat while my nails were still drying so she could start another woman who just walked in the door. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I've been going here for years found out about it via LA natives. People can be polarized about this place but it depends on your expectations and what you're looking for. On the one side it's very no frills. On the other it's a fantastic deal and very quick so I love it. I also started getting my eyebrows done here a few years ago and for $7 I get more compliments on them than the $50+ job I used to get at Anastasia in Beverly Hills<//Review>

<Review>Nail stylist was rude. I had an appointment, showed up half an hour early and was there for almost 2 1/2 hrs. I asked for nail poish on my acrylics.. They persisted that I used the gel which i finally agreed to amd it ended up peeling off my nails within 2 weeks. I would not recommend this place.</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Nothing irritates me more than a bad manicure. B & J  nail salon are inefficient, avoid attention to detail, use their hands instead of tools and instruments and long wait and constantly yelling and talking to one another in a different language which I find it to be rude. They also miss matched my manicure 💅🏻 and pedicure and told me to leave with wet nails which my nails ended up being messed up.</review>

I have came to this nail salon and have had many be respectful or complete attitudes. B has a extremely mafia bossy type attitude on in the phone like she can't handle her business. Christ and Julie are the only great and pleasant people there. I called yeSaturday to make a appointment and B told me to call tomorrow. I call today and another Julie have gave me a attitude on in the phone. I asked what Julie had available she asks me questions back. You don't answer a question with questions.
You females there need to learn to service and not talk about people aka your customers who pay you for services. WE DON'T PAY YOU FOR ATTITUDES OR TO BE TALKED ABOUT. I WILL REPORT TO BOB BBB AND THE COSMETOLOGY BOARD.</Review>

<Text>Waited 20 minutes for a lady to do my eyelashes and hated every minute there inhaling all that nail polish chemicals. The job was done really quickly and my eyelashes looked okay. The price was very cheap , $60, so I left $20 tip and did not hear "that you" for that. I followed all the rules and did not get my lashes wet for 2 days. In next 2 days they all fell out on one side and a few were left on other side. I guess that is why it is so cheap. Will never be back. Very low level place.< /Text>< pics>

This place is no good.  Women are rude.  They burned me during my wax.  Yelled in my ear consistently to others across the room.  Rushed me.  Did a crappy job on both manicure and pedicure. Not worth it.   Avoid this place.</text>

The price here is good, but last time they accidentally chipped my nails. The lady here was super super super nice and apologetic about it, and I don't love writing this review, but I think it's just a good heads-up to spend a few extra $s on a mani when needed.< /Review>

Worst experience I have had in a long time. Long wait, first of all. The woman was sloppy and unfriendly, she completed my mani/pedi in 10 minutes. She barely removed any cuticle or callous, but just focused on the polish - which was sloppy and uneven. My fingernails were filed thin and uneven. When I picked up the nail scissor to try to even them, she yelled at me.

It is a cheap mani/pedi at $18, but I had to redo it all at home. Would not recommend.< /text>

<review>I have been coming to this place for years. As it has been a while since my last visit, I was pleasantly surprised with some of the changes. The nail salon has a fresh paint of coat and management has purchased new Spa chairs !!! Need to know: they are no longer allowing tips on credit cards & they now have a new sign in process.  All walk-ins are asked to sign in with their name & service they are requesting.  My final tip is the prices have changed, mani/pedi (No spa) is now $18. This is still the best bargain in town. If you want an added bonus, ask for Tutu she does an amazing job. Have fun< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2bb6f123d2f9b:0xb4c05bfbfc9d32e3</GmapID></record>

Me and my mother went to get Mani and pedicure.... But the way they treated us felt rude and a little racist. They upset more when one of the four that helped us made a joke saying my mother had to tip them all . I felt cuz we are Hispanic they assumed we didn't tip or something.... We actually value the hard work and,service anyone gives us. So that day Made me feel disappointed in the nail shop because they are very clean. But not just that one was doing my nails really fast while talking on her phone. Not sure if I give it a second chance.😣< /review>

My first time going to B&J nails was a great experience! I decided to try it for a mani/pedi because it's close to my house so an easy walk and had good reviews and prices online.
I called around 10 to make sure they were open because sometimes this isn't the case around here (listed hours online not matching actual hours of operation) and they answered pretty fast to let me know they were open and taking walkins and gave me the prices. I walked in  around 10:15 and they were able to help me right away. The woman who did my toes was a total pro and cut trimmed and buffed my feet and nails without any pain and got rid of a LOT (I'm ashamed to say) gunk! Another woman came to do my fingernails after my pedi was over and she was quick and thorough! I was finished with both mani/pedi and drying by 5 to 11 so I wasn't even there for an hour! Everyone there seems to be experts not only at nails but in customer service!
The only bad review I'd have is of a couple of customers there while I was that were constantly complaining. I don't care to go too deeply into it but both customers were over the top rude and were still treated with respect and patience.
I will definitely be returning here and see if the experience is always so stellar<//text>

It’s a nice accessible hike/walk for beginners. Pavement then terrain. Please don’t leave fruit peels. Just because it is biodegradable doesn’t mean it should be left there. What isn’t grown there should not be thrown there. I picked up some trash but next time I’ll be more prepaid with a trash bag.<//text>

This is one of my favorite hikes in LA.  It's a 5.2 mile hike if you go left at the camp grounds.  It's pretty easy and goes right along the river to a big dam waterfall.  The hike back up is more challenging, but totally doable.  Great place to picnic and stroll along!< /review>

<Text>The camp ground wasn't anything special at all. If I had one word to describe it, it's would be dirty as there is just bits of trash all over the campground, cordage tied to a bunch of trees, old broken tent poles, you name it, it's there. I had read beforehand that homeless people like to stay here and that is absolutely true. I do not have a problem with homeless people, but what I do have a problem with is that that took up 3 out of the 4 major campgrounds, leaving recreational and backpack users with noot as many options. There is a good water source for filtering and plenty of firewood. Although, it does get quite windy sometimes and the campground sits right in the middle of an open canyon. I would come back if I had to, but this wouldn't be my first choice.<//Text>< Pics>

<name>Carl Burdick< /name><Text>Beautiful location ruined by careless campers.

This would be an amazing location for an easy overnight backpacking trip, but unfortunately most people leave food out which attracts animals,  and  the garbage problem here is unbelievable. The warnings about bears placed everywhere are there for a reason and there's clear signs of garbage bags being ripped apart by black bears. if this sort of behavior picks up its only a matter of time before the forest service closes the campground.</Text>< rate>

<Review>We only hiked thru here. The place looks run down (old forest outhouse falling apart and trash all over the ground). It's too bad, I'd like to stay there but that trash will attract rats and other animals.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Once you get down into the hike it's absolutely beautiful. There were 8 or so creek crossings to get to the waterfall. Dogs are allowed on leash, but several owners let theirs off anyway 🤣.
BEWARE: the last Mile or so of this hike is NOT fun. Very steep incline with little to no shade.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Best, most clean, most beautiful, rideable, hikeable, campable, most wonderful little campground gem Southern California has
🙂
🙏
Eternally grateful to Gould for some of our fondest camping and biking memories

I'd work for the campground for free,
I treat it like I do my own home to keep it available to future explorers for years to come</review>

<Text>Proximity and ease of entry make it a great overnight spot. Bike packed in with a buddy, we rolled just hammocks and it was no problem. 5ish fire pits. No water. There are toilets. Great place to shake down your gear and test it out before you head into real wilderness. Note though it is a free and open camp ground and attracts some interesting people, transient types camp here year around so just keep your wits about ya and it'll be fine.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<text>Great trail for mounting biking. If you like a moderate challenge on an 8 mile ride this is your trail. The trail does go further and there's are more trails to enjoy (streams to cross & rocky terrain). Very popular to the locals and people travel from afar to take pleasure on this hiking, mountain biking and horseback trail. Bring the family :-)!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Great backpacking camp. Really nice married couple that are volunteer rangers on the weekend and hand out bottled water to thirsty hikers and bikers. Saw signs of coyote and mountain lion tracks near the creek crossings...use extreme caution hiking at dusk or dawn when these big cats like to hunt. The water is clear and cold but should still be boiled if used. A really awesome wilderness area close to the great city of Los Angeles. I used public transport from downtown ( gold line ) to the 260 bus line along Fair Oaks Blvd. To get within a mile of the trail head. Great people, great park, awesome fun!<//Text>

<Review>While hiking I discovered I was getting heat stroke I stopped at the campsite where you may want to call them homeless people but the campsite where they were camping. They were  there to help me and I was scared too. Mesa is always going to be a special place in my heart the people there very helpful very generous may God bless them</Review>< pictures>

Nice hike when you get to the bottom but the road down to it is a 500-foot decline which makes it tough coming back but plenty of shade at the bottom and plenty of water right now and we didn't see one person<//Text>

One of my favorite hikes in all of Los Angeles. The trail is accessible by the camp site, but also from Switzer Falls and near JPL. It is well shaded and hugs the stream, if there is enough water.

The camp site is down a mile long fire road, so pack accordingly, especially because you'll have to walk back up the steep hill.

For a better back packing excursion, start the Gabrielino Trail near JPL, it is a good hike from there to the campground. If you want to do hard mode, start the gabrielino trail near Switzer. It is a good 9 mile hike along the arroyo secco, through some mountains, valleys, and an old river bed. With camping gear, it will be a great adventure.< /review>

<text>The last time I was there was about 25 years ago. This is a backpacker's campsite; in other words, the public cannot drive to it; you must backpack in or ride a horse in. When I was there, there was a ranger that lived in a trailer. There is a community of rangers that live nearby. This is a great place to hike to; it is an easy walk. The trail roughly parallels the stream. There is opportunity for shade along the trail from (near) JPL. There is a relatively large pool in the stream next to the camp.

If you continue up the trail you can go all the way to Oakwilde Picnic Area which is also a backpacker's campsite. The trail is easy except for the part that goes past a dam. I think that is in the area of the Paul Little Campground.

If you continue up from Oakwilde then the trail becomes relatively steep. It goes up to the Switzer Picnic area.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

As of August 2017 there are reports of not always friendly homeless people living at this campground.  Be careful.<//review>

<Review>I usually never had an issue with A-1. This would be my second time around choosing them for storing my extra stuff. I always love that they are indoor and I never had to think twice of rottens, termites, or bugs accessing my belongings. The only thing I didn't find comforting was the price going up every other month or sometimes every year. Other than that I had a great experience!!<//Review>< rating>

I rented space from A-1 Storage for 13 years.
They have always been clean and well lit inside.
Carts could be added or replaced, but I appreciated
the basic gate security.< /review>

Very nice & clean storage units. Grounds are very pleasant & safe & secure. I’ve rented from other storage companies & had to move out of state & am using another company that is notnnearky as nice as this location. Brian (I believe he is a manager here) is super great & helpful too. Awesome dude! Very pleasant & friendly. He helped me tremendously when I moved out!< /Review>

This is the best place ever to store your personal belongings! I have had a unit here for 3 years now and have been very happy! The manager Brian, has been very helpful and pleasant, each and every time I have spoke with him. The building is so nice and clean, along with being well lit, if you need to be there at night.. It is never overcrowded with a lot of people, and the hours of operation are such a great help, with having access to you unit. This A1 Storage is the total package, very professional and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to feel comfortable, safe, and in a clean (even smells good) environment! Thank you staff, for your hard work and kindness, I am a very satisfied customer!</Text>

<user_id>118333717290635314548</user_id><Time>1459890603302<//Time><text>Great in and out secure access.  Large elevators with great carts available at elevator rather than having to give up driver's license to get one to haul to unit.  Configuration of building interior facilitates easy access in and out of elevators and units.
Manager is friendly, responsive, and knowledgeable.  The kiosk and direct phone are great.
I recommend it highly.
I had the unit for three years, and this past month was able to move my possessions back home after an extensive remodel.   The move out was a great deal of hard work, but with the carts, the labor was cut down considerably...only fourteen loads and a U-Haul, and I was on my way.  The maintenance staff was there at the time, and during their routine, were able to incorporate a sweeping!  Wow! you cannot ask for better than that.  Should I or one of my family or friends need extra space in the future, I will turn to A-1!  Thank you again Brian for all your help and support.

Easy online application. Once application submitted got a call from on site manager. Great customer service. Was very courteous and professional. Showed me how to access the unit and walked me to see it. The only con is that they require a special cylinder lock but you can  purchase one from them for $10. Brand new looking facilities and units. Big elevator for upstairs units. Great place for the price! Make sure to take advantage of their online pricing!

Came back to lower one star due to them raising my rent 2x during the 1 year that i had my unit. They will also charge for insurance if you dont have renters insurance. Other than that great clean units and property.</text>

<review>Everything you want from a Storage facility, and nothing you don't.
Access hours that meet your needs, flatbed carts on site, ventilation (not A/C or climate control), and a helpful and friendly front desk.
And their rates are as good or better than their local competitors.
I've been renting spaces here off and on for almost 20 years.
I don't know why I ever tried that other company with orange doors, but I am here now, for as long as necessary.<//review><GmapID>0x80dd2abbc59707a1:0x80242feebcc792e< /GmapID><Name>DL< /Name><Rate>5<//Rate><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1500488465632, 'text': "Thank you so much, David N.

<text>Excellent... The building is so clean and organized. I was looking for other storage, but nothing compared to this. Must of the storage around the area are dark or wood made; this facility is concrete and steel made. If you care about your personal belongings, this is the right place for you... Brian (manager) is very kind and professional.< /text>< GmapID>

The manager(?) Brian accused us of having a dog there even though we clearly didn't. My daughter ran up to someone else's dog and started petting it. Brian and a woman came around and said nothing to me, but called my husband and threatened us saying is was an evictable offence. The AC on the 3rd floor is also broken. It's technically 'on', but it's always 90 or more degrees in there, which I'm 99% killed all of our electronics which do not work now after storing them there.< /Text>

Have been a sleep apnea patient with Sleep Data for many years. Always through follow up, timely service, expertly provided. Met with Jaim Deines today, RT, and he spent lots of time with me evaluating my CPAP machine, advising on mask, and helping me to get new equipment. Very pleased with monthly text from company asking about needed supplies, etc.  Location a bit hard to find the first time as GPS tells you to turn on “ Monel Street” but no sign by that name, and no sign on Kearny Villa Road indicating Sleep Data at the entrance. The building is in back of two other buildings you can see from the street.</Text>

I have been trying to get an appointment or someone to answer but it seems impossible to get a hold of anyone. I had a doctor referral to Sleep Data for over a month and a half.  I have the insurance company's approval. I get no response from this company. I emailed two weeks ago and someone said they would get back to me and still nothing.<//text>

I was able to schedule an appointment and be seen about a week. The process was organized. I had to confirm my appointment date and time which was conveniently done by my cell phone. The check in was straight forward. Where sleep data shines is the staff from when you first walk in to the RT helping and providing in service for cpap. I appreciate their fun professional attitude. Thank you.<//text>

I was worried when my Apnea appliance got too loose despite trying to fix it by myself and I know because of Covid, Sleep data will not accommodate me. But I was happily surprised when Dorian scheduled me right away despite their tight schedule. Theresa who fix my appliance is amazing. She stopped her lunch and made me feel at home . She quickly fix my appliance and made me another bite )which I kept on losing ). She is very friendly , accommodating and solved my problem right away. This place is highly recommended FIVE STAR!!!</Review>

< Review>
The team at Sleep Data in San Diego county have been truly excellent to work with. They always go the extra step to help you out. During approval process with my insurance for my CPAP, they called me every other week to check in and update me, even if there wasn't any particular news. After I began using my CPAP, they called several times my first two weeks to make sure the adjustment process was going well and I wasn't having any problems or concern. Now, I've unfortunately lost my health insurance midway through the process of it paying off my machine. When I called them to discuss next steps, they had two options off the bat but told me they were going to research more options, so we could figure out which one would best work for me. I really can't recommend them enough.<//Review>

<Text>Ken was very knowledgeable about the Cpap machine and went over the instructions on care and how to use it. He also showed us the video on the machine. He answered all the questions that we had about how to use the machine and clean it. He took the time to make sure that we had all of our questions answered about it. I would highly recommend going to Sleep Data in Oceanside.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Where service has always been very good at this facility, sometimes there’s someone that makes a visit extraordinary.  On that note, yesterday (5-1), I met with Tanya at the Kearny Mesa office. My appointment was with someone else who was not available so she stepped in.  She was filling in to that office from Escondido.  She was very pleasant but had a natural positive attitude which made me feel at ease. She walked me through several choices and gave me helpful information to make my choice a better informed choice.  Having worked in a highly demanding customer service environment, I can easily tell when someone demonstrates a more than a job attitude.  For that experience, thank you Tanya!  I could say good job, but more so, just be yourself.  You’re awesome.</Text><time>1556820900692<//time>< response>

Great knowledgeable staff. Very friendly and helpful. Def recommended! After months of simply trying to pay my bill online, being threatened with collections and paying my entire bill before my insurance paid anything, I have changed my rating. The telemarketing staff there doesn't even know when someone else has called. Constantly trying to sell you more product.</Review>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>I was on time, yet it’s been 40 minutes and I’m still waiting....seems like an excessive wait time. Here to be refitted with a mask that (hopefully) doesn’t irritate the bridge of my nose. People are nice, but I’m underwhelmed at the results. The RT who offered the initial choice of masks did not fully discuss the pro’s and con’s of each mask. It was clear I was being steered toward choosing a specific mask—without being given a useful justification. So yeah, wear the mask for a couple of minutes in a “fitting” then wear it 5 hours while sleeping. Now at 43 minutes back to see another RT.

All good. New mask.< /Review>< gmapID>

<Text>The staff has been amazing from starting to finish. They fit me in at a time which fit my schedule, provided me with a reasonable time frame of how long the appointment would take, the check-in process was a breeze & my consultant was warm, patient & compassionate. I have been putting this process off for years because I don't enjoy doctor appointments, but from my first consultation, the home sleep study, getting fitted, to my first night using my machine, this has been amazing & I wish I got started years ago. They gave me all the information I needed. Even the online app is easy & informative! They do everything for you to help you succeed. I'm absolutely blown away at how wonderful literally everyone has been. Thank you!<//Text>< pics>

New CPac user experienced some difficulty adjusting and operating device.  Went back for remedial instruction, but still faced difficulties.  Called in, invited in and a less complicated mask was provided.  Fully professional staff, easy understandable instructions provided. Very satisfied with services provided.< /review>

I have never met an organization that really cares about my health (that are not my physicians).
Every employee at Sleep Data that I've had the pleasure of working with, has always come thru for me. Be it just a question or changing out my device for one that is better suited to my needs. These people are just AWESOME!<//Text>

<review>Level of care is top notch. FAR better than what I was getting through another provider (Supercare health). The calls I used to get from Supercare were only if I needed to buy more supplies. The calls I’m receiving from Sleep Data are centered around how to make the machine & mask experience better and improve my quality of sleep. Brought me back in for refitting and to try out a different mask solution. Far better.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dbffb069c5b3f1:0x9f2263a60ea3e183</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This is the best medical facility I have went to so far! Everyone is really fantastic and nice! I went here to get fitted for my adjustable mandibular repositioning appliance or "customized mouthpiece for sleep apnea" and Dr. Odom explained everything thoroughly! I have tried everything for my sleep apnea: CPAP's, APAP's, full face masks, etc. If you have sleep apnea or snore loudly, I highly recommend you get a customized mouthpiece. I have tried all the mouth pieces online (PureSleep, ZQuiet, etc.). However, if you do not have the resources for a customized mouthpiece, then I would highly recommend ApneaRx! Good luck with your sleep!< /Review>

A very professional, competent and customer-friendly  organization in a clean, well-equipped facility.  A real improvement over my prior experiences with other CPAP companies over the last decade.

This is based on my 40 yr career in biomedical engineering, as a Medical & Engineering School faculty member, and as an R&D/Business executive in a major medical specialty device Corporation.</review>

The staff at the Escondido are the BEST!!  They have gone out of their way to help my husband adapt to using his CPAP.  There has not been a question to small to answer, a discomfort that has not been taken seriously and resolved, a fitting of a mask that wasn't done with patience. The adjustment to CPAP has not been easy, but I know that we have all help available that we will need.  A BIG thank you to all of them.< /Text>

Feel like I'm back home again after being a patient from Mission Valley several yrs ago. Great new facility with plenty of room, plenty of parking and plenty of seating, vs MV :)
Warm, friendly, welcoming staff. Patient, tolerant of my humor and knowledgeable in answering all of my questions. From the front door off the elevator being greeted and checked in, to being introduced to "Wes". My visit could not have been better. They Rock.
Let's just say Sleep Data Nailed it!!
Simply put
If you're apnea isn't managed by the professionals at Sleep Data, you're most likely dealing with amateurs.<//Review>

I was hired at this place and in a very short notice I lost a family member. They fired me because I didn’t know how to come to terms with losing a very very close family member to me . I tried explaining to them they didn’t seem very genuine.< /review>

I have been to other sleep centers and they were a rip off. Sleep Data is the real deal. They are very professional and helpful. They took my insurance and covered everything.  When something went wrong with my CPAP tubing, they replaced it that day. I wish everyone could have the same experience as I have had.< /Text>

<Review>New Manager Bridgette is a joke. She is rude and tries to degrade people but she doesn't even know anything about DME billing all she does is micro manage us and try to find any little thing to scold us for spends her time making spreadsheets for us to work off of but none of them make any sense. I honestly don't know if she will last long. She gossips and acts unprofessional she rolls her eyes behind her lead Carlas back as she is trying to help people and smiles in her face. There about 6 temps waiting to become permanent she brought in her 3 friends who also know nothing about DME billing and hired them permanent and now she has a meeting and is saying it's too over staffed?  why did you just bring your three friends on permanent then.  So that means all the temps that have been waiting to become permanent for months! will be let go for little reasons but it's really because she is bringing in her friends n needs to get rid of the temps the temps that trained these new people she just hired. if  you don't agree with her she becomes livid and you become the next target to be let go theye no morals when it comes to billing One of many things is illegal dx changing to get paid. The new "LEAD" if you can even consider her that is so unknowledgeable when it comes to AR and medical billing she knows NOTHING! She was a payment poster that worked there for years and since the previous manager i guess quit unexpectedly because of the horrible environment and the ways things were ran and EVERYONE on the AR team were temps besides two ppl who were permanent but only worked there a few months she got promoted out of desperation now she  has the worst attitude ever and tries to tell people they are doing things wrong when in reality they are done correctly but she doesn't know that because she's a payment poster. They have you do things any biller knows we should not do legally! Just to get payment. They will go  down if audited. They are years behind in billing and bill patient for balances from up to 4 years ago smh.  This place has absolutely the worst Moral they treat their billing staff like trash you have to check in and out for your 10 MIN BREAKs you can't drink there coffee you can't take your breaks in their breakroom you can't park in their parking lot it's super micro managed over all a stressful place and I only see it getting worse. In my time being here I have seen more than 10 people get fired for reasons that didn't make sense or they quit. One girl quit after the first day because management was so rude to her.

They are a great company for patients I can say but the billing department needs lots of work as far as being an employee there !!

***Derek is great and so is Bretton but they don't see the billing management/department for what it truly is so they will continue to lose great employees behind it. Until they can see it nothing will change and I cannot say anything will get better any time soon**</Review>< name>

From the phone call for directions to the receptionist to Katherine who assisted me with the CPAP equipment, everyone at Sleep Data was very friendly and happy to help. Katherine was very patient with my many questions. When one thing didn't work it was no problem as she knew what to do to solve the problem. I will be recommendind Sleep Data to family and friends.</Text>

Staff at Sleep Data Chula Vista are friendly and knowledgeable.  The RT throughly explained how to use equipment and how to request additional supplies.

To avoid delays for first time customers, ensure the items you are requesting are authorized by your health insurance before arriving to your appointment.< /review>

Good service and description of CPAP machine. Looking forward to better sleep!

Update, been using CPAP for over a month now, almost 2 months. What an improvement in sleep quality. If you have sleep apnea, you need to see the folks at Sleep Data and change your life!!</review>

10 top C/S in troubleshootingng equipmt and education and the latest in innovation, however receiving supplies from your warehouse would be abt 4. Took a couple weeks and several requests to finally receive two little ultra fine filters in a no 10 mail envelope. Was told repeatedly they had already been sent and should arrive in few business days. I only live less than 10 miles up the road. I had wanted to take some home the day of my appt but was told they were already in the mail. At least 2 weeks later close to 3 they finally arrived. This caused my review minus 1 star.<//Review>

My husband and I were both have sleep apnea. Insurance and doctor changes resulted in us going to Sleep Data in Kearny Mesa. We met with Marvin and were able to experience outstanding customer service ANYWHERE for the first time in YEARS!!  He is very knowledgeable about sleep apnea and the various types of machines. We learned more from Marvin in a few minutes than we ever learned before. I'm so glad we met him. He is great.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I am very impressed by the personal care and interest the people and most especially my therapist Tonya ha e given to me .I have been to 4 different sleep specialist and centers .once I get my machine no one had ever checked to see how I was doing .My apnea progres s ivly has gotten worse. I now ha e Sleep Data to provide my supplies .My old machine from another company broke .I called Sleep Data to let them know .They asked questions such as how old is my machine OLD. When they realized I had a broken machine and could not use they were willing to see me that day .I told them my,car was not working well and getting to,them was going to be hard .They sent Tonya to my home the next day .She brought me a replacement until they could get approval from my insurance for a new machine .She brought several masks for me to try .Also shecexplainrd that they would keep track online in real time .Just of note .I,have had the disc on my old machines and never was it looked at.
They have called me every day .My pressure has changed and this machine corrects for that change .My apnea is changing so I feel much sad we knowing someone is watching what is going on .
I am very happy with this company and am so glad I now have them watching out for me .<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dbffb069c5b3f1:0x9f2263a60ea3e183< /GmapID></record>

My 10 year old CPAP finally died and I needed a CPAP ASAP.  I only had a couple of hours sleep and could not bear a whole weekend without the much needed machine.
They got me in without an appointment and set me up with a loaner until the insurance approves a new one. I left very greatful.<//text>

Great spot. Thai in CA is actually better than home in NY. Their Thai rice with the pineapples is really good. Pot stickers, drunken noodles with chicken and beef mussaman curry are also fantastic.</Review>

Meet was so tuff you could not chew. The soup had zero meat even though I it should have come with chicken and shrimp. Would not order again.< /Text>

Was in the mood for some noodle soup after a successful morning of thrifting, felt like rewarding myself with all the good finds I did today. Stumbled upon this gem literally I stumbled right in front haha but walked in and was instantly hit with an aroma of spices! Took my seat and already knew what I wanted, boat noodles ftw!! It's so homey and full of flavor you can't really go wrong ordering this. Oh and the plus is the price!! Everything is how Thai food should be priced. You'll see none of that overpriced shizz here and me being me I had to get something to go because it's so rare when I'm in the area gotta make it worth the trip! Hits home if you looking for some Thai foods!<//text>

<Text>Quiet Thai place with a fascinating menu. The food is not consistent, unfortunately. We have had some great food at times and mediocre at other times. The elderly lady who sometimes takes orders and manages the place is rude and even scary.
The place certainly has potential, if they get their act together.< /Text><date>1564887256800</date><Name>Aby Mathew</Name><user>104957904335340740473</user><Rate>3< /Rate>< Pictures>

< Review>
Ordered a lunch special item that came with a side of broccoli asked server to exclude broccoli made sure she understood not to include broccoli, I was taking it to go, after driving home a  10min. Drive, I brought container inside and as soon as I lifted the lids container I could smell the broccoli, there was at least  4 trees of broccoli, that I quickly removed although meal had already been contaminated. If I hadn't just hated broccoli, someone would could and should be dead right now. food allergen's beware at this place.<//Review>

I have been to many Thai restaurants and to be honest this is the BEST Thai food I have ever had since I was BORN!!!!!  The salad was plenty,  the sweet n sour chicken is fabulous.   Fast service and excellent waitress. I will come back for the next 99 years again even though I live in the SFV.  If I had a helicopter I would eat here every day for lunch and dinner.<//Review>

Always get delivery and delivery service is very quick. Orders are always accurate. I stick with the basics but the pad thai is always above average. The food is prepared fast and prices are fair.</text>

I've been waiting an hour and a half for my food, after they said it would be less than an hour. Called ten minutes ago and they said it would be five to ten minutes. If you want their food just go to the restaurant because it wont arrive to your house. Still haven't eaten, if the food ever gets here it better be amazing.<//text>

While the food itself is standard, the customer experience was beyond atrocious.  Despite living nearby, deliveries would often take over an hour to come and they even threatened to stop deliveries if we didn’t tip better!

The only reason I’m giving this restaurant two stars instead of a one is because of its okay dine-in experience.</text>

Solid Thai food. The pad prik King is very good. Green curry and Panang also delicious. I noticed a lot of people order Chinese food here. I wouldn't do that, ever at a Thai place. Stick with the classic Thai dishes. Soups are yummy, but I found the larb a bit too tangy. And if you want Chinese food go to a Chinese place. My 2 cents...< /text>

The staff is always helpful and the food is always on point.  It's not life changing, but definitely worth a try.<//Text>

Under new ownership and the food is delicious!  The menudo on Sundays is one of my favorites with giant hand made corn tortillas.< /review>

<review>I was here today for was soppose to be a good sea food.
But the food never came after 1 hr ans 15 min of waiting. The place was not even full. I decided to leave for that reason they still overcharge me $ 3 for a coke.
I will never come back again to this place.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Yeah, sometimes it takes a bit to get your food but--with the volume of cutomers they have...it's worth the wait.  Their recent remodel is gorgeous. It's open and inviting, Plenty of natural light. Thanks Tacos TJ for another great meal and service!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>If i could give 0 stars i would...a year aago was my first visit and was an unpleasent one service is terrible. No one offered to seat us down as we came in we had to find our own table took 10 mins for any one  to notice us. 15min later we had drinks and had our order taken, but we noticed other people that came in way after us had their food one table had fajitas a cocktail an plenty of other time consuming dishes, while we were waiting on 8 simple tacos.after everyone been served but us and almost 40 mins later i had enugh we got up and left. A year later i thought i give it a second chance. It was the same story all over again we waited so long for simple tacos that never came that we just got up and left. Never again. If u want good food and super fast and proper service go to Tijuanas in fresno much much better.<//Text>< pics>

I love this place! Don’t let the reviews from angry Karen’s of the world keep you from trying out CCs Hair Salon. As a butch woman I find it very hard to find a salon that can give me the cut and style I am looking for. Cee Cee has always done a good job of giving me a fresh cut that I have confidence sporting! Glad this place lasted through Covid 😁< /text>

Omg! I absolutely love Cici and her sister! They were both very professional, extremely knowledgeable about their profession, helpful, and definitely know how to deal with curly hair! I also love how they listen to your wants and concerns and try to best accomplish what you are asking to be done to your hair! Cici saved my hair after it being cut horribly by another salon! I am sooo thankful for her and her skill and knowledge! I almoat gave up and thought I'd be walking around with awful hair for a couple months or a year! I highly recommend Cici's as you will be in good hands and will have found a stylist thst you can trust! Excellent customer service! Thank you Cici!!<//Text>

I just have to put it out there that, this is hands down the best hair salon I have been too. I would never let anyone else touch my hair. She is very passionate and hard working. My mother and sister has appointments and she was all booked up and stayed tell 11pm to do my hair. It turn out amazing and I get completes everywhere I go.  She always makes sure to fit me in and stay late if needed.</Review>

She is willing to let you see how the products work before you buy and doesn’t push them on you. She has faith in her products and they show!!! These products are great and so is Cici! I would recommend her to anyone who has any hair needs; cuts, color, treatments, etc. Very satisfied lady right here! 😊</Review>< Date>

I usually dread going in to a salon to sit there uncomfortably hoping the stylist is friendly and knows what they are doing. Cici was a hoot and I loved the atmosphere. Was very nervous about cutting my long hair but cici did an awesome job and I love love love the cut! First place ever where I have decided to definitely come back for all my future cuts and style!<//text>

< Review>
CC is amazing!! I bring my daughter to her for haircuts because she is the only one I trust to do it. My daughter looks forward to going to salon every time. CC goes the extra mile in styling her hair after as well with curls or braids and fun color sprays. I love how confident and trusting my daughter is with her and I know she is in good hands from start to finish.<//Review>

<text>I have been going to CC's for a few years now and I absolutely love it. Both Cece and Elsa are just so welcoming and accommodating, as well as great at what they do. They specialize in color and Cece recently dyed my hair from black to blond and did it in one session with her choice of opting for high quality products, which are a bit pricey, but so definitely worth it in the long run as the results are fantastic. I am absolutely in love with my new hair. I believe Tuesday and Wednesday are appointment only while Th-S they welcome walk-ins and take them as long as they have openings. I have a bad habit of calling last minute as I never know when I want to get my haircut and decide spontaneously, but they ALWAYS take me ASAP whenever I call. I highly recommend them, especially if you're looking for a warm and welcoming place and those great with their craft.< /text>< date>

I have been going to Elsa for my hair needs for years. She has seen me thru blonde, black, brunette, tasteful highlights, some also maybe not so tasteful highlights that were my idea and I have then since learned were not a good idea, and most recently red. My hair used to be pretty unhealthy, but ever since Elsa has been coloring it, it has never been so healthy and gorgeous.  I take a lot of pride in my hair and I have Elsa to thank for that. I consistently get compliments from strangers and that is all thanks to Elsa's fantastic work. Since I am a loyalist I have not had the pleasure of CC doing my hair, but I would in a heartbeat as both these ladies are the utmost professionals and experts in their field. Can't wait til my next appointment.<//text>

I love Cc! My mom, sister, and I have been going to her for years! She makes it a very personal experience and always does exactly what you want. She is very skilled, and nobody can beat her. She actually just saved my life last week! I had gone to Fantastic Sams for a haircut, and it was the worst decision ever! They completely messed up my hair, and CC fixed it! If she reads this, she will know exactly who wrote this because she saved me! I love CC, and I refuse to let anyone else cut my hair. Go to CC! You will not regret it! :)< /text>

I love this salon. Very professional, good color and cut. C.C. It's very knowledgeable and explains how to create for your color and hair. Good selection of quality hair care products. Elisa and C.C. are always fun to be around. Stimulating conversions as well as interesting shows on the television.<//Text>

<Text>Hair is a woman's crown.
When it comes to trusting someone with your hair, it's important to build a strong relationship with your hair stylist.

Cici and Elsa are two fabulous sisters who know how to make a woman or man have fun, feel sexy, and love the do they're in.

I've been going here for more than 7 years.
I take my son to see them, and soon my daughter!

Doesn't matter what you're looking for, they can achieve it.
If they feel it's something that won't go with your hair type, they are knowledgeable enough to explain what the best option would be to help you achieve your hair goals.

The atmosphere is always fun in there.

Make your next hair appointment with these lovely ladies.
You won't regret it!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>A great hair salon! CC and Elsa are extremely knowledgeable and talented, they definitely know their stuff when it comes to hair. The salon has a great vibe, very fun and friendly, and I always have a good time while I’m there. I have never left disappointed and continue to go back.

<Review>Can’t say enough about CC and how great she is in every way.. been going here for a couple years and she’s always done the best job on my hair, and as of last year I started taking my 2 year old there, and he loves being there.
She has the best energy and her place is always clean and welcoming. This is a place everyone needs to check out.

<text>This is where I go when I want my hair cut right. The ladies who work here have amazing skills. I've never had anyone cut my hair the way that they do. I like to give step by step instructions when getting my hair cut, so that it comes out looking exactly how I want it, and they are very patient with me and care about making it look just right. The AC is nice and cold during the summer, and there is always something interesting to watch on TV while waiting to get a haircut. I would recommend this place 10/10!<//text>< pictures>

CC set my curls free!   I am a bit haircut phobic because I've had bad cuts in the past.  I chose Cc because of her online reviews and I'm so glad I did.  Her consultation was great and gave me complete confidence to let her work with my hair to create a style that would work for me.  She gave me lots of great ideas about how to care for my curls while she cut my hair.  And WOW, I never knew how curly I could be.  She is a genius!  She even made sense of my bangs, so they look like they belong with my curls.   My hair was so beautiful when I left her salon!  But the best part is that the next day I washed my hair, used the products she recommended and then let it dry without touching it, just like she said.  After it was dry all I had to do was scrunch it with my hands and Voila!  My hair was amazing!  I've never ever been able to style my own hair as well as when I left the shop until now.  :-)  I'm so thrilled that I found CC.</text>

<Text>The best hair salon ever! I have curly hair and all the other salons I have been to completely mess up my hair. Nobody knows how to deal with curly hair better than these guys.

They are like a family hair salon for us now. And they are so funny and friendly. They have tremendous patience and they know their stuff!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
I wanted to have bangs again and try to have a hairdo since I am growing my hair out from a short style. I decided to go to CC's Hair Salon because I read so many good reviews on Yelp. I made an appointment and when I arrived Heather Leigh was ready for me. We discussed how she was going to cut and style my hair. When she was finished with my hair I loved it! She did an excellent job. I would recommend her to a friend. I will continue going to this Hair Salon in the future!<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Joe did an amazing job with the service. Best plumbing service I’ve ever experienced in my life. I would recommend this company to anyone I know for their plumbing needs. Joe came out, attempted to unclog my kitchen and took additional steps to diagnose my issue. Unfortunately we weren’t prepared at the moment to spend more on the repair but we definitely would recommend the service to family/friends. What a great representative of Elite Rooter Joe was couldn’t ask for a better plumber.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1628172472312, 'text': 'Hi, Al!

Found company on google. Called Saturday and had someone come out today, Monday morning.
Jose showed up. Super nice guy. He put covers over his shoes before walking in then he put down a thick paper where he was walking. He was very polite. He cleared the drain for $79. All went as expected. Will use again.</review>

<text>First of all, this company has a very quick response! They send a repair person instantly! This is so so so so important for us cause sewer and toilet problems cannot wait, otherwise there will more damages.

The repair person is highly professional, very very nice and kind! Seeing him so good at his job really help to ease my anxiety over the broken toilets.

He did full inspection for us, a quick and professional repair and replacement for the toilet, in a very reasonable price!
He also sent us repair clarifications, pictures and future recommendations after he finished his job! And the company stuff are also very happy and patient while assisting the repair person on paperwork.

Overall, this is a very pleasant experience, the best I’ve ever had! I will definitely recommend this company!< /text><response>None< /response>< pics>

Scott, the Regional Manger and Mike, the Manager also came by my home to inspect the sewer drain pipe to diagnose the reasons for my clog.  Their experience and wealth of knowledge was very impressive!  All three are true pros!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Jovany was very professional, clean, polite and was great on communicating all my options on all the repairs that my system needed. He ran all the test showed us all his findings and then fixed the problem! We would definitely use Elite Rooter again in the future should I come across any other plumbing issues and would refer Elite to all my friends and family who might be in need of a plumber! Jovany deserves 10 stars!!!!!< /review>

We had Elite Rooter come out and service our backed up kitchen. Joe was very knowledgeable and fast with his work. He made sure he wore booties inside my home, laid out some protective paper to cover my floors and did an amazing job clearing my drains. I'll make sure to use Elite Rooter for any future plumbing issues.</Review>

About two weeks ago I had a clogged shower.So I called up elite rooter , they sent out Jovany L. He was a very nice gentleman . He called me to introduce himself and gave me his eta of 20 mins. Which is pretty fast from when I called usually plumbers(that I’ve used in the past) take hours to arrive. He came, realized what the problem was, and was able to fix it in less than an hour. I definitely recommend Elite Rooter; they are efficient, honest, and truly care about their customers. Thanks Jovany !!</text>

Arnold showed up in record time to my home to diagnose what I thought was a plumbing issue in my kitchen. Turns out it was a non-plumbing issue. He was courteous and honest in his evaluation of the problem. I will certainly call Elite again for any future plumbing needs!</review>

Julio did a great job of identifying where the clog was located and cleaning it out. He communicated what was going on well. Finally he spent extra time cleaning up under the sink cabinet from the spray from the snake. Overall very satisfied with his work.</Review>

They were fast and they showed up really fast when I said it was a leak, Allan didn't waste any time and found out where the leak was coming from, not only repaired it but found out why and fixed that as well. Otherwise I would be sitting here w another leak. Totally appreciate it,  I am not at my vacation home often so these things are important to me.  Way to go Allan.< /text>

The service from Julio was simply amazing.  He was super nice, fixed the issue and left the bathroom cleaner than he found it.  He noticed that I was missing two gaskets and immediately got them and installed them.  Little things like that often go unnoticed by some but not by Julio.  Seriously great experience.  How often do you get to say that about a plumber?  Elite in Orange is my new go to plumber.<//Text>

Pretty bad clog in my master bathroom. They were unable to get it done without more work than we had hoped for.  Everyone I dealt with were professional, from the office to the field personnel.  Very satisfied with the service we received.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I needed a repair and maintenance service on my tankless water heater. I searched on Yelp for a local business that could provide the necessary service. I sent a message with my needs to multiple companies and Elite Rooter responded  quickly thru Yelp. After a couple of messages back and forth for more details, Jason the local Manager was at my house within 2 hours. Great guy, extremely knowledgeable and all repairs were done quickly and correctly at a very fair price.

I highly recommend Elite Rooter for any and all your plumbing and water heating needs!</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

This was not the 1st company that I reached out to for help. Actually, they were the last!

They were the 1st to contact me though, 3 of the other "top rated" companies still haven't contacted me, and at this very moment I am hitting the 13th hour from the point when I first started trying to get help. All of those places that advertised 24 hour assistance, didn't give 24 hour assistance. Did I read it wrong? Maybe they meant it would be at least 24 hours before they start their assistance process?

It started with a nice call from the person that sets up the appointment slots. The first 2 afternoon slots wouldn't work for me because I work swing shift. She managed to slip me into a 10am to 12pm slot.

I received a call from the Senior Technician at 11:01 am, he said that he would be at my parents place in 20 minutes. I am going to call my parents Senior Technician, R.G.! I don't know if the gentleman wants his name posted, I should have asked, but I was pushing that window of time and it didn't even come to mind. R.G. knows who he is, his employers should know who he is too, hopefully when you ask for R.G., you will get the same Senior Technician that saved the day, the weekend, the month of March, and so on, for my parents!

So R.G. called at 11:01 am, he said he would be here in 20 minutes, he knocked on my parent's front door at 11:15 am. I took him into the bathroom to show him the dilemmas! Normally I can get things flowing again for my parents in 15 to 20 minutes, not this time. None of the regular things an average person does for their messed up toilets worked. Not only could I not help resolve the problem, the problem was getting worse and worse by the hour!

I showed R.G. how the toilet wasn't working, then how it has been messing up the bath tub and shower next to it, and how the shower in the 2nd bathroom has started doing the same nasty thing the bath tub that is next to the messed up toilet is doing. It's All Bad!

R.G. looked everything over, then he started running scenarios for me. I expressed early on that I needed real numbers. An exact amount would be the best case scenario, if that wasn't possible, I would rather be told a high amount, then paying a lower amount at the end, then receive a low amount and have to pay more at the end.
R.G.'s worse case scenario is looking around $325, and possibly having a lot of doo~doo water all over my parent's floors! That will not be a good thing!

R.G. took a few minutes to try and figure something better for my parents. He found what he needed on the roof of the apartment building, he's going to try the main clean out, all he needed from us is electricity.

R.G. was up doing his business in no time flat, unfortunately it was not successful right away. He kept grinding at it, I was hot just standing on the grass watching him, he must have been smoking up on that roof, with the sun beating down on him! He never showed it though, half an hour later, both showers were fully functioning again, and the toilet is as good as it has been in the 5, almost 6 years that I have known about it and seen it work! All Wins!

It got even better though, the specials that are offered, are really real specials! $79, that was it! Some of you that are more experienced and skilled at these sort of things, might not think that is all that great. For a person with my skill set and experience, it couldn't have gotten any better then what I received today! Our Senior Technician, R.G., easily could have taken me for a ride for $150, $200, possibly even the $325 that he gave me when I wanted that high side estimate! I watched him the whole time, the man was working, like for reals working!

Honesty and Integrity! If you are running into people that have these qualities all the time, you are truly blessed! I do not run into these types of business practices all the time, I wish I did! More often then not, I have experienced the opposite of Honesty and Integrity!

On the Real, call these folks if you really need help, they'll hook you up proper! Thank You, R.G.!!!</text>

I would definitely use this company again.  I called for clogged sink.  Upon inspection it turns out it was a simple repositioning of a dishwasher hose.  I really appreciate Lawrence honestly and not trying to offer me services I didn’t need.  I will definitely be recommending this company to family and friends.<//Text>

<text>These guys came out to clear a clogged drain. Spent hours trying to figure out what was causing the clog. They said we had broken pipes.

They left a port open in my garage while running water flooding my garage. They didn't even offer to help clean up. I called out another company for a second opinion and they cleared clogged drain in minutes, and showed me video of clear pipes.

Do not trust these guys!!<//text>< pics>

This company is 5 star all the way. The service and customer service were outstanding... but the best part about these guys, is the actual care. They came to service my bathroom sink during this "much needed times". They were quick to respond and quoted everything up front.
Mr. Rob Sandoval was extremely informative, and placed high priority over our bathroom use.. again during this "much needed time".. the Division Manager Pete Padilla also came to ensure everything was done to get us back up and running.
This company did not "stack" pricing on me or charge me by the hour. Very professional and Very Honest!
During these "much needed times" where households need plumbing, water, gas and electricity.. Elite Rooter is the plumbing company you want to lean on for support!

Thank you Pete, Rob and the entire Elite Team!

Stay safe out there!< /Review>

Julio was very polite and respectful of my property. He unclogged the drain and cleaned up.  I would take issue with the advertised price of $69 to unclog a drain. It had to be rootered, which is the name of the company so that  implies the drain will be rootered, and it cost and additional $56 because it wasn't "just" a Ptrap rooter. This seems misleading.< /text>

<Review>I was so thrilled when Jesus arrived on time, as time is always of the essence.
He was awesome.
He cleared the clog off our kitchen and the charge was as explained online and before he started.
I recommend him for sure.
He was very nice, knew what he was doing and very pleasant to work with.

Robert S came out to unclog our drain today. Very professional and polite and respectful, 3 qualities missing from most businesses. Very impressed with Robert he did a fantastic job and if I could give him 10 stars I would. Recommend the company for having such good employee and Robert S in particular, one in a million. Thank you Robert!! 2brothers< /Review>

<Time>1591464686072< /Time><rating>5</rating><text>My teenage daughters have an enormous amount of hair. Even though I used a zip it tool to remove a handful, the shower wouldn't drain. I yelped for a quote and Elite Rooter immediately responded and set up an appt for the next morning.  Brian arrived on time and was able to remove a kitten sized clump of hair (definitely not as cute as a kitten though) and get the drain flowing again in five minutes. Highly recommend this company!<//text>< Pics>

Having needed plumbing replaced under our home throughout, Rafael and his team were excellent. He was thorough, explained everything wrong and what needed to be replaced and took lots of photos to show me. He also took photos afterwards so I could see what they did under my house. They cleaned up completely after each day’s work and took proper Covid safety measures at this time. We will definitely be your lifetime customers.<//text>

Arnold came over within a day to snake out the clean out in the backyard. He was very professional and offered advice going forward. Despite not being able
to fix the issue, he did not charge me for his time, and provided options for future work.< /review>

<Review>I had two other plumbers come to my house to fix a plumbing issue. They both gave me quotes that I didn’t feel quite comfortable with. I thought it was way too much for the work I needed done. Michael Lanphier from elite router came out and I felt that he was honest he gave me a good price. He gave me different options of different ways I could fix the problem and explained what was involved. I was extremely happy with the work he did. I would recommend elite rooter. He was very professional and completed the work promptly and I feel the problem was fixed right for the right price.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Response>

< Review>
I called Elite Rooter after another plumbing company gave me a ridiculous bid to fix my main sewer line. I called at 9am and they had a technician (Michael Lanphear) out by 10:30am that same morning!  I can’t speak any higher of the Michael. He was quick, efficient and really explained the whole process to me. He came, he cabled and he cleared my sewer line. Will be using these guys again!</Review>

I called for a service a couple days ago and an employee named Michael Lanphear came to my home. I called Elite Rooter on a whim and having been frustrated with previous services from another company, I was reluctant to have someone in my home that I did not know. But Michael was a very pleasant person who displayed a high level of professionalism. After some browsing I found that I was quoted a very fair price and I am more than happy with the service I received.<//text>

<Review>I’d give them a minus 5 if I knew how.
Did not have the best experience with Elite Rooters as I discovered after agreeing to this company’s price that it was twice what other plumbing companies charged for the same repiping job.  Buyer Beware! As senior citizens  it was hard lesson for us.

They did not preform the work but hired another plumbing contractor to complete the contract. That company contracted with another plumber who completed the job.
Found out from another plumber that no permits were obtained, no insulation was installed, and pipes not installed behind the drywall but placed in front of the drywall. Another $600 to repair their mistakes.</Review>< user>

<text>I was having a backed up kitchen drain.  Michael lanphear came out and after multiple attempts at snaking my drain. He informed me that the entire drain was completely destroyed and it had to be replaced. Thank the lord I had michael out that day because if it wasnt for him I would have never known.  13000$ later water was flowing and so were the positive vibes thank you thank you thank you elite rooter for the great service.</text>< userid>

Soro the rooter was very resposible when he learned that there was a leak coming down from the upstair bathroom. He came back right away in the evening and pumped out the water to prevent any more leaking. He and his supervisor returned in the morning using the video camera to resolve the clogging in my sewer.</text>

First time ordering here, I got an order of wings, breadsticks and pepperoni pizza. Food was ok, the crust and breadsticks lacked flavor, dough tasted like cardboard after reheating, 3 stars because of the fast, friendly customer service and their reasonable prices.<//Text>

< Review>
Pizza is good, barbecue chicken is my favorite. The wings are decent. The price is lovely. The front cashier is always cool, no matter who it is.
The only thing is when they're in a rush they sometimes cut the pizza in super uneven slices or super shallow cuts. It's not a big deal though and never stopped me from coming back.< /Review>

Definitely the best pizza in town over all the other name brand places but...... When I order they always say 10-15 minutes and always end up waiting at least 30 even if I go late guys just say 20-30 minutes it would be much better especially for phone orders the whole point of phone orders is so that we won't have to wait!!</Text>

<rate>2< /rate><review>I like this place but last time I was here I was next but there was no employee by the cashier so I took a seat and waited for an employee to take my order and as I was about to make my way to walk up to the cashier someone who had just walked through the door cut in front of me and even though the employee saw that and even though I voiced my fustration that I was here first both the customer and employee ignored me and continued taking the order. Thankfully another employee witnessed and overheard it and quickly opened another register and took my order quickly so I wasn't going to make a scene but I am not a fan of the poor service, that staff guy, he clearly saw me inside before the other guy walked in and saw both of us making our way to the cashier, saw that the other person just ran in front of me and still chose to serve the other person who cut in line and didn't even apologize to me or anything instead the nice lady that took my order apologized for him to me.</review>< Pics>

<review>Same prices as little ceasars, but better quality. They're occasionally little swamped but that's because so many people like their pizza. Longest wait time for ordering in store was about 15-20 minutes and it was just cause they needed to make a new batch of wings.< /review>< GmapID>

<Text>the pizza is great but the employees are not . their debit machine or whatever is always failing on them , they ask you to wait 10+ minutes for it to "reboot" & end up telling you that it still doesn't work . the manager there has no balls to stand up to the employees , it's sad . AWESOME PIZZA BUT BE SURE TO HAVE CASH ON YOU .<//Text>< pics>

Pissed me more off one of cashiers had funny smerk on face and asked  what was going on with my order her response " I didn't take your order". And still left with no time when my order would be ready. I like this pizza especially being a P.T.A mom and getting pizzas from here especially on family lunch day @ my kid's school< /text>< Pictures>

The pizza is great but I'm guessing they are to scared to use the pizza cutter because everytime I buy some they never cut the pizza so I have to go home and cut it........</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Great little 1.5 mi hikes. Take the dogs 🐕 or just the bicycles. Am definitely coming back! The Reinhart Redwood Regional area is a great way to start the trails then goto the Redwood Bowl area and parking is free. Not too much shade at this location though. The Roberts Rodgers trial is so beautiful and so much shade. Some incline and declines but nothing crazy. Bring the kids! Restrooms were pretty clean too.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpA8HdIZy9UEJWAIWE6IUlkgTsesg4KUfPWqeO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBKXZxsoVuIs-Ot10BBS_Z8E6gluWNr-XHgdco=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpBLeQX3EQN-zI-URDhrccFL43jUJPDB_RDdko=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFCk0nGAef2tx9tHvcbjDljyI3zsGA_zLqLk98=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmNVWsKStmvQM7TqmXQy-71_6MOi8zAY_iE7hZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMERLMnedTX0lCzS0tw24ru7m8VLrk0CMI0v83K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt3CWgp4eLLf5a6rSUlKHkaZViq5VGcU_0N7xX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-5nNLgqo9FCz67GFo8OK7k4-_ozli7gQkIaog=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNM5okoTlyci3pbKrayfoRVxUxUM2ep9U9MMNiE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4t__BP1XwiuITx35N5e9dzVpbYqKuAheTIhbg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipON-jqonqcNV3TqVbTjpKDbmFRSkAkyGHLcphCR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJjdR_N46SRrAUpJcn6nQoaRFdDKj43rrl_lHV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwUnhvziAxfxYtIrc91oMxJcQpSQxEyDkpp14V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFVY2BhQYmetItsgLQFxykX5fD8En5SWfkpKmd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsyIarRtrXY9ZHfcztP0gX0N1unt95kk6NwMUq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBnQIUK5dkgOUiXWjUaR-GzY76hblxpfcInldN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRSqyAvqKdj0A3wREYKuvCdj76v-B6ZxqwcgRA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0iHvc9uspMvH4yku6IK2xIGGKdaaps-e_A1C5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPssBuJnIsnk_44JF463U1hr4zRqGv85RqHRaIF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPct2rKfWKmubjzvYyVOvAbtob6iZt0XaGED3nR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0Ha-fMZ607jVKMwGCuzQgjPC7jdBOZY7oWQRj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7_KfQg2iBZNfGvTWqJH_hz6HivR7goGAl_IzI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHdctTtHSIj3xQG9aKgXsF0dC4qu8vjSN8rLmH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQgmK5WF6oes6iZsm-71EOc3u7rLGSSFDNieFn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8fSKKmiT3MlCvBO9LrVDuoY7RlC7FZhYPhuN8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMemfukp8ujgGt-RS93Ktl1QpgBAtxC1Alek-UT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9jfT9LUh99v0O1imryjB9h7BjYD2pbBjApL0F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808f8862d1951541:0xcec649dca80bdc12<//gmap_id></record>

Great park, very popular but lots of parking. Went in the main gate and the fee was FREE (don't know if this is "normal" or not because the sign said $5).  Walked on the main trail down to "Trail's End", which is about 2 miles roundtrip.  Lots of beautiful redwood trees besides a stream.  No cell service in the park, but I felt relatively safe (in case of emergency) because there were lots of families with infants or young children walking, too.  Overall a pleasant and quiet experience.  Lots of picnic tables near the trail in meadows.  Also, several more miles of trails, some of which go up over the hills.</review>

Great spot for bdays. The pool is pretty crowded now so we usually avoid it. $5 parking fee unless you park outside the park.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>First time here and love the park. What a view! Trails are well maintained and clean.

Bring a map if your using your cell phone - download offline maps of the area you are hiking.

Popular park, parking can be full on the weekends. Best to go early, less packed. Bring water and a lunch and enjoy.</Text>< pics>

<Text>Great views of redwoods, it's like a hidden gem in the city. You can easily run the trails or hike with dog on leash and get well over a 1000 vertical and with so many trail options. All trails meet together and there are many options for different parking lots and variations of trails for different levels of hikers.< /Text>< rating>

<text>Love this place, wear mask around other walkers on the main path. Otherwise no mask as comfortable. A place for walkers. Beautiful Redwood trees and forest.
Pets on leashes, family friendly with a large playground area.Bathroom facilities well placed along main path and clean Parking good but crowded on weekends.
Basically a place to really feel the earth, hear the birds, smell the forest, look at the stream to see how it's doing.< /text>< GmapID>

One of my favorite parks in the Bay area. Many hiking trail options, from easy ones to intermediate. Ample parking if you go to the main entrance (fee). You can start the hike from several other staffing area entrances as well.</review>

One of my favorite places to walk. I go here as often as I can, but usually during the week when it is less crowded.  Next to the Girls' Camp, there is a small field of redwoods.  It gives me an opportunity to unwind as I stand in awe of these beautiful giants.
This park is great for exercising,  relaxing,  and connecting with nature. The trails are clearly defined,  and aside from the gnats in summer,  the wildlife watches you from afar.
Fellow hikers are usually courteous and friendly.</Review>

What a little slice of heaven!
It was so nice to stop in here.  My daughter and I went on a hike here around a bit of a windy trail that had great views and lots of trees and dogs!
We were just in town for the day but the fresh air was so nice! After our walk we went down the hill a bit and climbed some stairs.  It was beautiful ! We would definitely come back when we’re in town again!<//Review>

Great views of redwoods, it's like a hidden gem in the city. You can easily run the trails or hike with dog on leash and get well over a 1000 vertical and with so many trail options. All trails meet together and there are many options for different parking lots and variations of trails for different levels of hikers.<//text>

We hiked, explored, and realized how beautiful our hidden gems in Oakland were...and learned how much we need to preserve our environment! Save our environment.... "Take memories, leave foot prints." And please be kind to one another!< /Review>

It was great and our big wheel stroller handled the terrain very nicely. My 9month old enjoyed it very much. There were horse riders out and my daughter loved meeting the horses and their companion riders. The views were spectacular and therapeutic. I look forward to another visit.<//review>

Love this place, wear mask around other walkers on the main path. Otherwise no mask as comfortable. A place for walkers. Beautiful Redwood trees and forest.
Pets on leashes, family friendly with a large playground area.Bathroom facilities well placed along main path and clean Parking good but crowded on weekends.
Basically a place to really feel the earth, hear the birds, smell the forest, look at the stream to see how it's doing.< /review>

Our first time hiking here. Our dog was able to meet a lot of other dogs off the leash, will definitely be back. Only downside is there is a notice at the beginning that during covid they aren't emptying trash cans. So although people are picking up after their dogs, no one wants to carry the baggy all the way back to the parking lot so there was lots of baggies throughout the trail.< /text>

Tres Sendas and Stream Trail

I started this hike from the Waterloo Staging Area. Enter the park on the West Ridge Trail. Make a right on Tres Sendas (three trails). It descends down to the Stream Trail. It is considered a moderate hike because it goes down, down, down. And to get back to where you started, you have to go up, up, up. Most recently, I went after a rain during the week, so there were many people. If you go during a 3 day weekend, you can expect to run into a lot of other folks. There are no bikes allowed, and dogs are allowed on a leash.

I took lots of pictures--one of my favorite things to do, hike and take pictures. I loved that I could hear the sound of water running down the hill--a sweet sound to my ears. Funny, but I heard some owls hooting during the day. There were lots of birds fluttering about.

There many hiking options when you go in from the Waterloo Staging Area. You may want to look at a map and see exactly what you want to do.<//Review>

Great place for a peaceful hike with varying levels of ease or difficulty depending on which trail you choose. Went during the week, hardly anyone one else on the trail, perfect for social distancing.< /review>

<review>This park is a gem in the East Bay. The popular West and East ridge trails (together they form a 10 mile loop) have great views inland and of the bay. There are miles of trails snaking through the redwood forest and along the seasonal stream at the bottom of the park. In November thousands of ladybugs can be found on fallen wood in the lower areas. In the summer, usually in July, you'll see the goats and sheep brought in to eat up the dry grass for fire management. If you're lucky you'll see the heard dogs corralling them and moving them to the next area. The bay laurel trees are very fragrant. Very special place!<//review><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

The park has a lot of trails. The cell connection is on and off through the trails so take a map. You are hiking through beautiful redwoods. The paths are pretty shaded. Be prepared for descent elevation changes (climbs and descents). We definitely got a good workout. For being so close to Oakland, you felt really away from everything. Be prepared for a descent amount of people on the hike. People were respectful of space during Covid 19.< /review>

One is in the valley along a creek and the other 2 are on tops of ridges. Plenty of smaller trails in between so you can make the hike as long and with as much elevation as you like. Dogs are allowed and can be off leash in most the area.</Text>< user_name>

Took the kids and the dog, parked on the street because it seemed like the lot for Redwood was closed or full or maybe every other spot was blocked off (hahah!) We took the Golden Spike Trail for about a mile then cut across back east on west ridge, past toyon and then back onto Golden Spike trail. Lots of elevation climb on this one and steep ascents downhill back towards the park entrance. People need to pick up their garbage and stop partying on these trails 😲😭🤔. Today was cool and breezy, a nice break from the heat these past few days.< /text>

We started from the Canyon Meadow parking location and did a loop along the Westridge trail to the Bay Area Ridge Trail to Golden Spike down toward back down onto Toyon trail back to Bay Area Ridge. You can get a map at the entrance or download it to your phone on the ebparks.org website.

Protip: If parking on the roadway of the park entrance, do not store valuables in your car or keep them out of site. Lots of broken glass along the road indicate car break-ins happen.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOS29qYHCDAbdDExXkEDK5OPDgRod7CpUWXPNlO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4xBV6lPrmR7UvEPAwxpzNZStsGVa3t0UUTlsN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOV0Pc6mKUwR-iAyOQy9VNRXqzvRW4UsqbIXcvj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgB9bwU7shBWJrgGXBnU8Ief16jYRifB6Z7FLi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv_zH2aDE4ZNEWXqEg3haDfvJ-tK5Wopi6UkzF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

<Text>Lovely park with amazing views of the area and plenty of photogenic spots. Had fun exploring the trails and breathing some fresh air.

Word of warning, your cell service is likely to drop to non-existent or in-usable once you get up there. So if you don't have a car and tool a Uber or Lyft, make sure you have a car service number on hand or another way to get a ride back.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtDUJ5G7xBpmgCCW7aUOnSDLlli8IQsKONzMCF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqcnX8-VHopGYzxL1xsjxvxhrhPXWnITz69zPx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7TaK7wmmYOF0wo_rZ13EbyjUmp1a-icJnya0e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCCqq1OybXPYlipJP2Nv-DUqphLFsF-mE64EUk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwaUDu0aULpkEZ6bNu9fib4xxZn5MFqGF9c_A9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Right in Oakland we have a jewel of a redwood park.  It is not hidden, just drive up Redwood Road from Rt. 13.  One can BBQ, picnic, hike and bike.  The park has many segments and day use areas. Many of them can be reserved for a group activity.  The Creekside Trail goes on past the day use and bike riding area becoming a shaded hike through lovely groves that becomes a great hike to the top. Good place when one has put of town visitors.< /Review>

Delightful traill through the Redwoods. Just be prepared with water and there are no restroom facilities at this time due to COVID-19. Pack in and pack out whatever you bring in. Dogs on leashes only allowed.<//text>

This park is a gem in the East Bay. The popular West and East ridge trails (together they form a 10 mile loop) have great views inland and of the bay. There are miles of trails snaking through the redwood forest and along the seasonal stream at the bottom of the park. In November thousands of ladybugs can be found on fallen wood in the lower areas. In the summer, usually in July, you'll see the goats and sheep brought in to eat up the dry grass for fire management. If you're lucky you'll see the heard dogs corralling them and moving them to the next area. The bay laurel trees are very fragrant. Very special place!<//text>

Beautiful walk. There are varying levels of hiking difficulty from trail to trail. Dogs are welcome, so long as they're friendly. It's a popular spot, so you'll see other hikers, but all the ones I pass are super friendly. Altogether an awesome time.</review>

<text>Took the kids and the dog, parked on the street because it seemed like the lot for Redwood was closed or full or maybe every other spot was blocked off (hahah!) We took the Golden Spike Trail for about a mile then cut across back east on west ridge, past toyon and then back onto Golden Spike trail. Lots of elevation climb on this one and steep ascents downhill back towards the park entrance. People need to pick up their garbage and stop partying on these trails 😲😭🤔. Today was cool and breezy, a nice break from the heat these past few days.<//text>< pictures>

Nice place to take the pup.  Very very dog friendly. Beautiful nature trail that's very well groomed. I do wish there were more obvious markers along the way to ensure you are on the correct trail we had to turn around and back track and ask for directions a couple times.  Easy parking.  Nice picnic area with childs play area and bathroom houses. Love that it's so close to Oakland.</text>

Amazing escape, just minutes from downtown Oakland. I have hiked here about 10 times now and have never had a bad experience.< /review>

Loved beautiful redwood trees and wonderful trails. There were more people than I thought,  95%of people we passed had mask on. Most of them had dogs. Our dog enjoyed the hike as well.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>So many trails to choose. The trails are in the shade for the most part so it was nice and cool. The forest had a nice natural scent. Parking gets full quickly, and looks like there is a lot of car break-ins as I saw a lot of window glass on the curb. Beautiful forest with a lot of people walking around. Some trails get steep, so if you are out shape, it might be a struggle.<//text>< Pics>

Perfect place to take a quick hike when you don't have much time. Very easy to get to from downtown Oakland. This is my favorite place to wear out my dog.< /text>

Debut ride dialing in the new bike, also new to the Bay Area. Rode the Dunn trail... done and done. Mixed grade, terrain and sunlight. Plenty of vantage points. Accelerate with caution. Friendly people, just a heads up, lots of families and dogs. Bikers to yield to pedestrians and horseback riders (didn’t see the later on this trip).<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Right in Oakland we have a jewel of a redwood park.  It is not hidden, just drive up Redwood Road from Rt. 13.  One can BBQ, picnic, hike and bike.  The park has many segments and day use areas. Many of them can be reserved for a group activity.  The Creekside Trail goes on past the day use and bike riding area becoming a shaded hike through lovely groves that becomes a great hike to the top. Good place when one has put of town visitors.</text>< pictures>

<text>Great park with lots of different terrains. There is three main trails that go through the long park. One is in the valley along a creek and the other 2 are on tops of ridges. Plenty of smaller trails in between so you can make the hike as long and with as much elevation as you like. Dogs are allowed and can be off leash in most the area.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I have done two trails here, the most recent being West Ridge Trail. It was a bit steeper than I expected, but still very beautiful. The trail has a lot of oaks along the path rather than redwoods. I took Orchard Trail back down to shorten the hike, and that was through the redwoods. Overall a lovely hike on an overcast, chilly day.<//Review><time>1580401074409<//time>< rating>

California redwoods are an extremely unique tree on the planet and known for being the tallest tree. They are nourished by the Bay areas summer fog. So, next time you may not be feeling a foggy summer day in the Bay Area, know that the fog is nourishing our gorgeous, unique, vital redwoods.< /text>

Breathtaking trail. Good weather on the day I went and I wish we could have stayed out there longer! I got my intended nature fix! Also got challenged as the trail inclines were intense but doable!<//Text>

<Review>Absolutely beautiful. You'll be blown away that this place is in oakland. Clean trails, gorgeous redwoods, even a playground for the kids, dog friendly and tons of picnic spots. Right now, free parking during weekdays but $5 on weekends. Parking spots get taken up quick!< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD_DqVQ_MZHEzhDs5gM3ANtB5QMqI7-3YgEoAM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSHIUuJmGLDqR6cX_Li1gJ0YVBJzIt9t51Ij7F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

The park is one of Oakland's lunges, great to go to clear off your mind of the stress in life.
You come here for a walk and take back with you a mind full of peace.
Friends of 4 paws are allowed on leash, plenty of parking (free on weekdays), bathrooms and water drinking fountains.<//Review>

Gorgeous, almost-2000 acre park offering multiple recreation opportunities: hiking, mountain biking, picnicking, camping (groups with reservation), wildlife-watching (in winter ladybugs cover Stream Trail!), equestrian, etc. Accessible by AC transit and several access points have free parking. Toilets and drinking fountains in several spots, especially in the northern half. A fantastic East Bay Regional Park that feels light years away from the city.<//text>

Reinhardt Redwood is such a gem! I hadn't explored this place until recently. Perfect for hiking! This main area also has a paved road which is awesome for family/friends that are in wheelchairs or have strollers.</review>

Great place to visit...Nice trecking place..Good for walking,jogging, riding...Horse riding is also one of the option...No network connection..We will get WiFi connection in the service station near entrance... Adventure trip very nice to find route from one trail to another trail..The place is pet friendly..5$ is parking fee...Their is a good place for archery...we visited chown trail,old church, archery range, redwood peak...The view is good...Better to carry food ....< /Text>

<Review>Great place to go hike, run, or bike! Steam trail is a good shady path that leads through the middle of the park giving great veiws of the Redwoods. Once at one end of Steam trail you can take the west or east ridge trail for more of a challenge and loop back to the other side. Friendly people and great views.. Worth the trip every time!< /Review>< date>

This is a good place to have a walk with your dog or ride on a horse. The trails are multipurpose trails. There are some rules in the park, especially for dogs. Please read them before you enter.

There are mountain lions in this park and be aware.

This park is not wheelchair accessible. There is a very basic restroom.< /Review>

Word of warning, your cell service is likely to drop to non-existent or in-usable once you get up there. So if you don't have a car and tool a Uber or Lyft, make sure you have a car service number on hand or another way to get a ride back.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtDUJ5G7xBpmgCCW7aUOnSDLlli8IQsKONzMCF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqcnX8-VHopGYzxL1xsjxvxhrhPXWnITz69zPx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7TaK7wmmYOF0wo_rZ13EbyjUmp1a-icJnya0e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCCqq1OybXPYlipJP2Nv-DUqphLFsF-mE64EUk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwaUDu0aULpkEZ6bNu9fib4xxZn5MFqGF9c_A9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Beautiful redwood forest with expansive and well-maintained trails. There are sunny, easy trails for biking and dog walking. Or you have the option to go down into the dank depths for mossy, mushroom adventures. Love it and will be a long-time visitor.< /Review>

<text>I don't think I can sum up how amazing my experience to me was cat this place. I only had 2 hours to spend there and it made my  trip! The trees were HUGE! I walked the Stream Trail all the way to the spot with the lady bug mating area. The ladybugs fathered in the bunches like that was very cool to see! Something that I can't explain how cool it was to experience was how AMAZING IT SMELLED my entire hike. The forest gives off this intense smell that smells so good! It literally smelled like someone taped a dryer sheet call mountain forest to my nose. I was taking in huge breaths through my nose because I couldn't believe I was smelling something this fragrant outside. Once you get there you'll understand what I mean. Trust me I'm not crazy! Lol. I also seen a big California Newt walking accros the path. I thought that was cool to see! Whilst walking through the large Redwood trees towering over you I couldn't help but feel how powerful their presence was. It makes you think wow these gave been here so long and seen so much! We're literally so insignificant compared to them. In conclusion this is a awesome place to that would not disappoint you to checkout!<//text>< Pics>

This is a wonderful park that is somewhat of a hidden gem.  While the Redwood groves are not as extensive as Muir Woods, you wouldn't know it while walking the main trails.  This is definitely a great park for a hike, stroll or even just a picnic. - Update 6/6/21, the park is fully open and will cost $5 to park.  Restrooms are being serviced and there is an attendant at the entrance.  All of the lots were nearly full at the time of our visit about 2pm.</text>

East Bay Regional parks is doing an amazing job with their maintenance and updates of their parks!

There are several trails at RRRP. We started from the Canyon Meadow parking location and did a loop along the Westridge trail to the Bay Area Ridge Trail to Golden Spike down toward back down onto Toyon trail back to Bay Area Ridge. You can get a map at the entrance or download it to your phone on the ebparks.org website.

Protip: If parking on the roadway of the park entrance, do not store valuables in your car or keep them out of site. Lots of broken glass along the road indicate car break-ins happen.<//Review>

Another gem to escape from the commotion of the bay area. I love the solidarity of this park.

The trails can be quick for a family picnic or all day for an athletic person like myself. Easy to get lost in peace.

I recommend the French trail!!!<//Review>

<Text>It's one of the few hidden treasures in the East Bay Area. Several Regional and city park connected in the hilly side of the East Bay. There are quite a lot shades and picnic areas open to the public. Lots of trails are very suitable for mountain bikers.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGQqEYDQfw8fVG1lg8u4Q7GscCdmbTTPcj5Vg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML9hTX16RIftUH3AVSdDSOOOwZVe3iFrK4dlg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaQSnLkDpeQs5yxQsavVrOsiDtq2ayyXcC9Sk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMW-oBVjpsfaXj3fCez3HC0V9tCpqBrJfKXG9A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEmx-P1jrr7h8lfCfoK9azaC114tKCjwLGM3Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7O41Qi9PGfkJsqG-rSPyqrot_TkmtCkL_YUY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNISkL-blRxBb0JinIZDqGQXYSxZnu_YnRlveg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Review>Tons of great trails and beautiful redwood views. This park is a great place to go if you want to see beautiful California redwoods but don't want to brave the Muir woods crowd.

The various trails have a mix of shades and sunny areas, and a mix of elevation changes for any hikers that prefer either.

The skyline gate is a great place to start, the earlier the better in order to get parking, there is a lot but you can park on the shoulder right nearby.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQSPvQxGagR_a5NqiaR6jsWEV1aAQJZHDxdemw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQo-TvkVVdc4cRNg5Frze6ySoGgFD94wQ5a5Kq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_CRXI02VZGAA-XIDuKwWhqi4LWYS1SZQcyldO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Tall, majestic redwoods with out the touristy vibe of the big name parks. It was a very doable but engaging hike, with lots of options to make it longer or shorter. We did ~6 miles mid afternoon end of February. Low 70's and a sea breeze, light sweater recommended for the shady parts near the stream.<//review>

Beautiful park with both easy to challenging trails. There are a lot of off leash but friendly dogs here, so please remember that if you bring one of your own. It’s basically dog heaven, and usually everyone is very responsible about their dogs.< /Review>

<Review>Great place for a hike. Lots of trails for every level of hiker. We went with my 2 year old and she had a blast. This particular visit was peak ladybug migration. There were thousands of them!! Gets crowded so get there early for parking, but once your on a trail it pretty peaceful.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNn74v3KAIDQ0-HtmIpCQMly6N0rTn_9xBtMhzz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<text>A great place to visit if you're looking for an easy, relaxing hike. When we went there are thousands of lady bugs all over the place.
The trails are very easy and shaded. The lack of cell phone service makes it hard to meet up if you're trying to go with a group. I would recommend to get all calls done before going down the hill.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Redwoods in Oakland, what more can you ask for! Countless trails meandering through towering redwoods with varying difficulty. You could come here a dozen times and keep finding new trails to explore.</review>

Lots of different trails to take, some allow bikes and dogs on leashes. Beautiful trails along some Redwood trees. There is parking lots and restrooms, few picnic tables near the parking areas, can get crowded on certain trails, wear mask on the narrow trails difficult to 6ft. Distance. Enjoy the beauty< /text>

Had a good time hiking here. Theres plenty of greenery to enjoy and once you get up high enough its a pretty view.
A nice hike to get some exercise in. Some of the trails have a lot of up hill walking.
The bathrooms were clean and the parking was free.</Text>

<Text>Trails are beautiful and well crafted. But don’t park your car here. A whole row of cars were burglarized (including mine) while their owners hiked and convened with nature. A beautiful hike was ruined at the end of my trip when I found out my car window was smashed.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808f8862d1951541:0xcec649dca80bdc12<//gmap_id></record>

Best dog friendly hike I've found in the Bay. Really beautiful trail. Be sure to bring water for yourself and your dog, and be ready to pack out any dog poop. Parking is a bit limited on weekends, but lots of Street parking nearby.</review>

So nice to walk on the trails in the off season, no crowds, just beauteous Redwood forest and the colorful trees changing to fall... Plenty of parking, restrooms and a playground for the kids too!  Dogs on leash due to coyote warnings.< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Great place to see the redwoods without having to go to Muir woods. Weather was amazing and there are multiple different hikes to go to. Make sure you take a photo of the map prior to starting the hike. We did the stream trail to the French trail and went back through the west trail. The restrooms along the stream trail was clean.</Review>< Pics>

<Date>1575872770619</Date><text>It's amazing how you can still be in the city of Oakland and yet barely hear the city sounds while out hiking here. I love the fresh smell of eucalyptus and bay leaves in the area, and down in the valley you will find some beautiful redwoods. The colors are super vivid after a light rain, but watch out for mud.< /text><resp>None<//resp></record>

<Text>It's beautiful!!! Great place to hike, run, camp, barbecue. On weekends it can be hard to find a parking space. There are restrooms around the park and are well maintained. The redwoods are amazing!!!!< /Text><Date>1519436516383< /Date>< GmapID>

<review>The hike was great...the scenery the best and seeing the lady bugs in their winter hibernating mode was a first. Quite intriguing. I thought the trails were way too muddy to walk on...slippery, wet after rain days earlier. Safety...yet didn't realize that until you already in the hike mode.<//review>< userid>

Expected to see redwood trees and didn’t. Very little information, limited parking close to park, and we did t see a single redwood aside from the parking lot. Super disappointing.</Text>

My 2nd time hiking here but first time doing it in the Spring. Completed the full loop of 8.7 miles through the below trails:

- West Ridge Trail (starting at Chabot science center)
- East Ridge Trail
- Canyon Trail
- West Ridge
- Golden Spike Trail
- Montiero Trail
- Baccharis Trail
- West Ridge Trail (ending at Chabot science center)

I've realised Redwood is really good but it's not great, mainly because the views are limited especially if you compare it with other parks like Tilden that offers great trails paired with breathtaking views. But it's still a great spot that's nearby.

1st time we explored:

- Dunnn Trail from Serpentine Prairie
- West Ridge trail
- Bridle trail
- Stream trail
- Fern Trail
-West ridge
-Dunn trail end at serpentine prairie</Review>

<Text>Beautiful but... NO MAPS. Before you say “use your phone, dummy!” There absolutely no cell coverage w/in two miles of the main gate.  There’s very little to assist the new visitor if they’d like to hike spontaneously.  Don’t Uber to it unless you’re prepared to hike an extra couple miles on a road (with traffic) to get a signal.< /Text><userid>113758992214894836513<//userid><time>1532731937177</time>< resp>

It's a must, Grab your picnic baskets, the wife kids some ground blankets for the baby after they ate played ,or bring some hotdogs and buns ,chips ,h20,cookies, whatever makes you happy and enjoy the Redwoods, Who knows you may even run into a Lama, or 2 or 5.<//Review>

This our go-to for hiking locally. Only 20 mins from downtown Oakland and so breathtaking with plenty of redwoods. There's a diverse terrain from easy 3 mile hikes to really hard 8 mile hikes. Also in the winter there's ladybugs everywhere!<//text>

We did the Dunn, Golden Spike, Tate, West Ridge, Orchard, Bridle,  Stream, Tres Senda, Star Flower, Madrone,  Graham trails loop. Which is rated Hard on Alltrails. We parked at the Trudeau Center Parking. We started the hike right about 7am right after we took a few beautiful pictures of the sunrise! The earlier the better to start because it starts to get hot mid morning....although most of the trail is shaded but still quite warm. I would have to rate it moderate, not quite hard but my husband and I hike a lot and we normally hike trails that are rated hard so this didn't seem as hard as the ones that we have done. This is such a beautiful trail. The redwoods are just serene along the trail. We actually finished the hike @ 8.5 miles a little over 3 hrs with all the picture taking we did. Easy peasy in the beginning of the hike but after mile 5 where the picnic area is located (Old Church), your incline starts then there is a series of declines and inclines that follow. As always, don't forget your fluids! We would definitely do this hike again.</Text>

<Text>First time at this beautiful place, we noticed that many parents walk with their children and pets ,it has a few different trails some harder some very easy to walk, don't hope to see any water along the creek, I guess water only runs down during the raining season but not year round, because of the covi the bathrooms were closed and obviously mask where required most of the people there had it, nice pleasant place to visit!</Text><response>None</response><Time>1596813652665< /Time>< Name>

I didn't understand what this was, but when I looked it up, I found it was a smaller park next to Redwood Regional Park, so turns out I did know. Really great ambiance here with the redwoods -- those trees are ambiance queenz</Text>

The hilly trails are very well maintained.there's off leash dog trails and nice campgrounds with lots of space and firepits. The trees provide a nice canopy of cover and the weather, when i went, was amazing. Really don't miss this. It's a greatfamily trail hike or just a great trail run for anyone.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfdmXYr9IsBqwVwXBNCxRFscXhA7IM0PCVCRG7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3XVAs7FdyG-VndmK0Sg1NMHD7Chv-_uCRpzqp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXR_e9o80O1Hf8DvjfA7h08lH-g8FhoV7unFH1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Time>1529177149720</Time></record>

<Review>Great place to see the redwoods without having to go to Muir woods. Weather was amazing and there are multiple different hikes to go to. Make sure you take a photo of the map prior to starting the hike. We did the stream trail to the French trail and went back through the west trail. The restrooms along the stream trail was clean.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

It’s a mini Humboldt with lots of redwoods, ferns, and a creek. A bit muddy in the winter but other than that the trails are fun and challenging.< /Text>

This our go-to for hiking locally. Only 20 mins from downtown Oakland and so breathtaking with plenty of redwoods. There's a diverse terrain from easy 3 mile hikes to really hard 8 mile hikes. Also in the winter there's ladybugs everywhere!< /review>

Great place to escape from the noise of the Bay Area. Beautiful redwoods and plenty of shade (depending on the trail). There were lots of other people on the most popular trails, but otherwise, you just pass someone perhaps every 20 min. Plenty of opportunity for some alone time to find a bit of peace to get away from our overcrowded way of life. I read lots of complaints about parking but maybe i got lucky, parking was easy if you don't mind exploring a bit.< /review>

Tons of redwoods and ferns, very shaded, and much less traffic. I would highly recommend this loop -> Golden Spike, Bridle Trail, French Trail, West Ridge Trail Loop. It is roughly about is a 8.5 miles and is moderately trafficked loop trail located near Leona Heights.  I would rate this loop as moderate to difficult. Be aware that you would have absolutely no network here. The trail offers a number of activity options and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail though at certain points they need to be on leash.</Review>< Pics>

<review>If you enjoy hikes in the shade, with some sunlight filtering through, this is the place for you. A mild to moderate trek through this trail in the midst of tall redwoods, is a heart healthy way to spend your day. Before reaching the trail there are huge areas of lawn for families to have picnics. Also, there is an overflow lot if you arrive on a very busy day. It is free after regular hours if i remember correctly.< /review>< Pictures>

Gorgeous redwood forest, nearby and accessible.  No long lines of tourists like Muir Woods, but the same majestic experience under the redwoods.  Enter at the Redwood Road gate, walk about a mile in on Stream Trail, and you'll be immersed in redwoods, not crowds of tourists.  Rejuvenating, spiritual experience that will open your heart.</text>

Nice Views!

It's a small park, essentially just the top of a hill.  Unfortunately, the day we visited was cloudy and rainy, but we were still able to enjoy some good views.  It's easy to imagine this is breathtaking in clear weather.</review>

< Review>
Easy to get to, lots of trails to choose from, and there's plenty of shade cover which is nice for hot, sunny days.

Parking can be challenging; there's a few different lots from the main entrance but you should be able to find a spot if you're patient. If you're meeting someone there, plan ahead and pick a rendezvous point - don't plan on having cell service while you're in the park.

If you have a dog that's reactive to other dogs, this probably isn't the best place for them. The trails get narrow in some places and people often let their dogs run off leash.< /Review>

Beautiful, peaceful park with a really kind and helpful ranger. Watch where you step when hiking - I sprained my ankle badly rolling off a tree root I didn't see. Parking signs are confusing: the parking garage for the observatory is also for the park, and completely free! I wish we had had more time to enjoy the rest of the park.</Review>

Gem of the east bay. Good playgrounds and picnic spots. Stream trail and French trails are easily the best redwoods for miles. Cross over west ridge to more hilltop tree cathedrals at Roberts and Joaquin Miller for a longer loop and you don’t need to pay for parking at the bottom. Mtn bike loop around the whole ridge is a must!<//text>

<Review>I'm new to the area and was desperate for a sense of nature to reconnect and regroup. It's a beautiful place to do so. Not sure what you're looking for, but if you need a break from the world and its congestion, this is a great place. Plenty of parking, plenty of picnic spots and not crowded. There are plenty of options for difficulty hiking or biking.</Review>< pics>

Lovely park. Redwoods below, beautiful ridge trails above. Redwoods are not as unusually large as the ones in Muir, but the park is also not touristy at all. Cell coverage inside is mostly zero  Warmly recommend!< /Review>

<Review>My favorite redwoods to visit in the San Francisco Bay Area so far. I've been to most of all the well known redwood groves and the trees at Redwoods Regional Park, although significantly smaller and less dense, will not disappoint. I think the idea that metropolitan areas are less than 20 minutes away is amazing and truly emphasize how important and possible it is to conserve the natural beauty around us. You can find wide and level trails as well as those more challenging, truly great for the family! I highly recommend it!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
Part of the great East Bay regional park system. This place has facilities for group picnics and other family activities. There is a small fee to park here so if that’s a problem go to Joaquin Miller park around the corner. The fee goes to park maintenance so it’s put to good use. Be careful about parking on the side of the road to access the east bay parks because car break ins are very common there.</Review>

Loves this park!  Beautiful with all of the redwoods.   My only concern was how many people were BBQing and had campfires while we were on high alert fire restriction.   Wish there were more Rangers so they could keep up with it.  Know they are spread thin.< /Text>

Beautiful park and beautiful weather in July. We dropped in at the Moon Base staging area which is nearby the planetarium. We went on a Sunday but the planetarium appeared to be closed! We hiked the West Ridge Trail for about 3-miles in before deciding to turn around. The hike was easy for my wife and I but there are certainly plenty of steep hills so come prepared and have a map!</text>

Love this park. Went running through it with inside trails a couple of year ago and decided to come hiking with my girlfriend.

This park is rated moderate but you should be prepared for steep climbs if you’re making the loop up to Chabot space center and back. It’s challenging but totally beautiful and worth it

Lots of poison ivy on the main trails so be aware

Looks like an awesome park to have a day picnic with friends.<//Review>

<review>If you enjoy hikes in the shade, with some sunlight filtering through, this is the place for you. A mild to moderate trek through this trail in the midst of tall redwoods, is a heart healthy way to spend your day. Before reaching the trail there are huge areas of lawn for families to have picnics. Also, there is an overflow lot if you arrive on a very busy day. It is free after regular hours if i remember correctly.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Shaded. Some trails aren't marked well. You can loop around making your hike as long as you want. It also butts up to another park so you could even venture there.<//Text>

One of the most revered Redwoods in the area. There's a marker in Robert's Park showing where the tallest tree used to be and used by navigators out in the SF Bay. The only draw back is that it's best during the week because during the weekends, the mountain bikers take over and it's rather unpleasant (especially with dusty trail conditions). The highlight is that there are choices for inclines or flats.< /Review>

Great park with redwoods, good hikes with a lot of hills. Most of the stream trail was closed, which was announced, but they didn't tell we also couldn't cross it to an other trail, so we ended up with a couple of extra miles... nevertheless, great views,  beautiful flowers!<//Review>

This place is great. If you're going to do it in the rain. I would recommend staying on the ridge trail from the Skyline gate. Some of the trails a little lower down the hillside get nasty.<//Text>

<Text>The hikes are a nice pace and some areas are a good incline challenge for working the glutes and thighs. There is a nice picnic area near the archery range and a good stop for watering yourself and your dog(s). Peaceful and friendly hikers. Beautiful views.

A great place for all outdoor activities. Great trails for hiking, running or riding your MTB.
Beautiful Redwoods a few minutes away from Oakland and Berkeley.<//review>

One of the most revered Redwoods in the area. There's a marker in Robert's Park showing where the tallest tree used to be and used by navigators out in the SF Bay. The only draw back is that it's best during the week because during the weekends, the mountain bikers take over and it's rather unpleasant (especially with dusty trail conditions). The highlight is that there are choices for inclines or flats.< /text>

Stream Trail to Redwood Peak and West Ridge Trail is :
-6 miles: hike
-1112 feet: Elevation Gain
lightly trafficked loop trail located near Oakland. The trail offers a number of activity options and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.</Review>

First time being out here in years. Still great trails and beautiful trees. There is some erosion from the rain bit nothing preventing you from hiking or walking. If you have little ones, they can easily walk on the main tral.  It is paved and strollers and bikes are going up and down.< /review>

This is the best off leash area I've found. The whole park isn't off leash but it's huge and many parts are. In particular near the steam is not off leash. There are also many runners and bikers in certain areas. The hiking only tails are the best for dogs.<//review>

There's an area with a more desert theme for those open, hot hikes and an area that's densely wooded for the forest hikes. You can take your dog off the leash on certain trails and let them lose their minds running around. Went on a weekday and rarely ran into anyone else. Perfect for solo contemplation.<//text>

Great place to escape urban living for a while and take in some nature while off leash hiking with the dogs. Many off leash trails but check first to make sure the trail you're on is off leash so you don't get ticketed.<//Text>

Three uphill miles from the Orinda BART station, the park features deep ravines, very tall third-grown redwoods, views of San Francisco Bay and even Marin (with no fog). Many cycling routes. Useful maps at the park entrance. When I was there, mid December? Ladybugs were swarming in some places. Much less crowded, when I was there than Mt Tam.< /Review>

I've trail run a lot in here, taken visitors for basic or more challenging hikes, and also it's a great place to bring dogs. If you go early in the day like before 10am you have the place mostly to yourself and may even see dear or small rabbits.< /Review>< Response>

Great place to get out and hike in Oakland. There are multiple parking areas that get you into the park. It doesn't take long from any trailhead to be in the shade of redwoods. It always is surprising that this forest is just a step away from the urban bussle. Get out there!

The main entrance odd redwood rd has playgrounds for kids if that is more your thing.< /Review>

Fantastic park for many abilities and activities.  Mountain biking, running, hiking, off leash dog walking, bird watching and just taking in the views.   There are many entrances to this large park, but Skyline Gate is one of the main ones with a parking lot and bathrooms at the entrance.  Parking does often often overflow to Skyline Drive on weekends.  Bring a picnic lunch and water and enjoy a place you can unwind and unplug.</review>

<Text>Beats the pants off of Muir Woods.  Avoid the crowds, parking, and the cost.  The best part of Oakland...hands down.  Peace and quiet within the streets of the greatest city on earth.  Skyline Trail is highly recommended, however the moonrise over the entire United States is well worth the planning and timing!< /Text>< Pictures>

Lovely Oakland Regional park with a great variety of trails, wonderful redwood groves and big meadows to play on, including picnic tables. There are several clusters of toilets in the various areas as well as parking spaces . The redwoods, ferns and brooks are beautiful, many trails are shaded. Maps are available at the various entrances to the park.< /Text>

We stayed on the East Ridge Trail, which eventually connects up to West Ridge if you don't want to go down and up through the canyon in the middle. The climb back up is pretty strenuous. East Ridge affords open Vista views of the forests in the canyon, as well as the skyline. Wish people would take their doggie bags rather than leaving them along the trail.<//text>< Pictures>

For anyone who lives in the East Bay the Redwood Regional Park provides an amazing escape to nature. Beautiful redwoods, views, variety of vegetation and lots of opportunities for a picnic. Be mindful of racing bikes on some of the trails that allow bikes, it can be a bit much on the weekends!<//Text>

The trees cancel out the noise of the city, and you can be in cool dark quiet without going to far. We took the Sequoia and Wild Rose trails, and I recommend the experience to all Nature lovers or anyone looking to leave the city behind for just a few moments. A little busier than ideal, and also seemed popular with joggers and trail bikers, though we only saw a handful.< /Text>

Redwoods in the east bay! This park is easy to overlook compared to places like Big Basin, but it's much more convenient to get to, and still some great hiking. It's very dog friendly, people are allowed to unleash their dogs if they are responsive to voice commands and I'm always amazed at how well behaved the dogs are. In the winter there is an area that is literally crawling with ladybugs, look for the signs warning you not to step on the ladybugs, last time we were here there were a dozen or more ladybugs right on the sign! Besides the ladybugs, my favorite part of the hike is stream trail, in the winter it feels like a magical place.</Review>

Lots of trails to hike around here. Trailheads are well marked so you won't get lost. Many sections have plenty of shade as well. Fairly quiet on a weekday, I didn't see anyone for the first few miles. I'll be back to check out other areas.< /Review>

An absolutely beautiful Oasis in the middle of the Bay Area. A true hidden gem. Great place to get away for a couple of hours. especially if you don't have the time, or the resources to go someplace like Yosemite or deep Mountain hiking.<//Text>

Love taking dogs here for off-leash hikes. I stick to the trails that don't allow mountain bikes when I'm with the dogs. They tend to be steep, but well maintained trails.</review>

Easy hiking trails that are well labeled. Trails are shared with hikers, bicyclists, dogs, runners, so it can be busy. Bathrooms and water fountain at the trail head.<//Text>

This is far and away my favorite park in the Bay. It doesn't take long to get to secluded, single-track hiking trails through peaceful redwood groves. The vegetation is lush and the trail maintenance is just right. Go!<//Review>

I love taking out-of-town friends up to Redwood.  Within a few minutes, you can be out of the city and into the forest.  The Stream Trail is accessible and even good for strollers.  You can spend an hour or spend a day.< /Text>

Such a serene park tucked randomly in the middle of the east bay. You wouldn't even know you were right next to such huge metropolitan areas if it weren't for the occasional plane flying high above. Perfect for a relaxing or moderate level hike and you could easily spend a half day here exploring some different trails. Dog friendly too. Will be back here soon.< /review>

<date>1463558315694<//date><review>This place is amazing! The amount of nature you can get is undeniable especially it's so close to the city of Oakland. The place looks big on the map, however the routes are actually pretty short and with 4 hours of hiking, you can probably walk around the entire park. I strongly suggest you come in early in the morning as the traffic gets bad towards noon even during the weekend.</review>< resp>

This is a jewel for the East Bay: huge park with great trails plenty of mileage to keep you coming back.  Would recommend for bringing a dog and trail running. Can be packed on the weekends and holidays.</text>

Love to go there for a run or walk with the dog. One side of skyline is a dog off leash area, the other one isn't (although you'll see dogs off leash on both sides because some owners don't think the rules apply to their dog. It is sufficiently sign posted). Or take an ATB for a ride on the fire trail (again, sufficiently signposted, mind the walkers 🤗)</Review>

From this park on Redwood Rd in Oakland, to Willow Park Golf Course on Redwood Rd in Castro Valley, East Bay Regional Parks District looks after the operations of a lot of our East Bay lands.

Redwood Regional Park has a lot of pretty walking areas. We explored this place with a friend who was visiting from Houston. We paid to park in the lot and were surprised there was only one or two other cars parked near us.

There is a public restroom (and even a pay phone, since cell service is pretty spotty.)  We didn't walk far but found some pretty spots for pictures and enjoyed seeing the pretty trees and trails.</text><response>None< /response></record>

This is a huge park, with many different entrances and trails. The redwood trees are most abundant at creek trail, parking at the canyon meadows staging area. A great free/cheaper alternative to Muir Woods.</Review>

Beautiful. Lots of trails, and easy hikes. Some more challenging ones as well. Great for taking your dog off leash. But caution, lots of poison ivy and Oak along the trail edges.<//text>

Many miles of well-maintained trails, some steep and some more gradual. Deep in the valley there's a stream through the redwoods and it's very peaceful. Only signs if civilization there are an occasional airplane far overhead.</text>

Beautiful park that you should see if you're visiting SFO. It will save you the trip of driving up north. I went to the main entrance on redwood road (had free parking the day I went - Thursday), a lot of parking, restrooms, etc.  You have to go deeper into the forest to see more of the woods as opposed to the one by the stream.</Review>

My favorite hiking destination during the summer. The redwood trees provide the much needed shade during hot summer days. French trail is the most popular trail in the park.</Review>

The parking was easy ($5), and the weather spectacular. We were greeted furst by a gaggle of wild turkeys before being ascended on by an army of leashed and well behaved doggies.  There was a bit more crowd and pavement than i expected but the trails soon become perfect single track set among a gorgeous 2nd and 3rd generation redwood forest.  Lots of benches and picnic tables adorned the park and it appeared that you can even camp here with reservations.  All in all the park made for an enjoyable 5 mile hike.</Text>

Enjoyed this park. Being able to see Redwoods in my backyard is a big plus. It has a number of trails of different lengths and difficulties including a loop that can be done in an hour that takes you over hills, down in redwood shaded creekbeds etc. Also most times I've been it hasn't been super busy. There's a great bench right near the end of the hike that overlooks the hills and sits on a little hilltop in the sun. What a great touch.</Text>

Muir woods too far for you? Never fear for the majestic redwood trees reside here also!!! It's actually decently size too! It's a rather amazing place to go and get away from the city! Now to get there, there are multiple entrances and multiple trails to get here. As you are driving up north, you will see parking lots every couple or so miles.
The redwood forest easily envelops you into a beautiful get away.
There are camp sites here and sometimes the trails can become confusing as they start blending in with the surrounding area.
Bring some water although for most of the trail, you will be in shade so it is not too terrible.

I like this redwood forest and kinda prefer it because you don't really pay anything unlike muir woods where it's about $10 per person.
Be careful for poison ivy/oak!!! Don't get attached to this place too much unless you want to look for pete the dragon< /Text>

My lord this has got to be one of the most well kept parks I have ever been too! Beautiful trails with plenty of picnic areas and bathrooms. There are not many maps on site to keep you updated on your progress, so grab one for the entrance booth or have one on hand! Parking inside the park grounds is $5 per car, but lots of people park just off the major road.<//Review>

<Text>Redwood Regional Park is one of the gems of the East Bay.  It's not as well-known as Tilden Park in Berkeley, but is much better (in my view) for hiking.  It is pretty large (roughly 5 miles by 1 mile at the widest), and has some very nice Redwood groves, a trail along a stream, and trails along the ridges of the East Bay hills -- with more trails interconnecting everything.  Redwood also connects (via trails) to several other parks: Joaquin Miller Park Anthony Chabot Regional Park, and Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><user>112764545072374640877< /user><gmapID>0x808f8862d1951541:0xcec649dca80bdc12</gmapID>< Resp>

Beautiful redwoods, and great range of trails and distances to choose from. Not too crowded, and a better, calmer alternative to Marin or more popular hiking areas.<//Text>

Tons of great hiking. It's best to visit midweek to avoid weekend crowds. Overall, it's a very nice park!</Review>

Second growth redwoods so if you go looking for a stand that rivals the national park, this is not it. However, shady trails and a lack of undergrowth make for great spaces to explore and play.< /Text>

< Review>
Redwood Regional Park is one of the gems of the East Bay.  It's not as well-known as Tilden Park in Berkeley, but is much better (in my view) for hiking.  It is pretty large (roughly 5 miles by 1 mile at the widest), and has some very nice Redwood groves, a trail along a stream, and trails along the ridges of the East Bay hills -- with more trails interconnecting everything.  Redwood also connects (via trails) to several other parks: Joaquin Miller Park Anthony Chabot Regional Park, and Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve.< /Review>

This place is magical, especially when fog is rolling through it. Visit in the rainy season when everything is green, but also bring shoes that can handle mud. Dogs must be on leashes due to the equestrian centers nearby. I've seen people ticketed because dog can get injured or a rider can get hurt.<//review>

Second growth redwoods so if you go looking for a stand that rivals the national park, this is not it. However, shady trails and a lack of undergrowth make for great spaces to explore and play.<//Review>

<Review>Beautiful regional park with lots of hiking/biking trails, redwoods, info about some species native to the canyon, picnic areas, etc. It gets very crowded on weekends (especially during the summer), and there is now a fee to bring your dogs during peak use times.< /Review>< Name>

A beautiful (and surprisingly big) regional park with many trails good for hiking, biking, and horseback riding through challenging terrain populated with native flora. Native fauna also present, apparently including the occasional mountain lion.</review>

Great for moderate/easy hikes. One of the good moderate hikes is to start at stream trail, then go to tres sandes, then french trail, followed by chown trail back to stream trail.< /Review>

Incredible hiking with a bit of everything. Take a trail that crests above the ridge - the views are spectacular.</review>

I was surprised about this place, it has plenty of picnic spots. Trails in the woods are also nice, excep West Ridge trail which is too sandy and  I wouldn't suggest to start from it after Orchad trail.< /text>

(Translated by Google) I really like this meadow, it is green and peaceful. In addition it offers an exotic story to tell about the animals that once inhabited it.
