Amazing as always. This visit has to be the fastest dental visit ever. Less than 30 for X-rays and cleaning!< /Text>

Wonderful. Deante Hygienist was so kind and gentle with my three year old.  She explained to him everything she was doing and the dentist was also really lovely. My son is excited to go back.</review>

< Review>
Dr. Han took me on an emergency basis on a Monday morning, after suffering over the weekend with a really, really, really bad toothache.  Saw me first thing in the a.m. and did a root canal - saved me!  Love, love, love Dr. Han!  Can't say enough good about him - "he's got skills" ;)</Review>

<text>Had to schedule an emergency checkup for my 3 year old and they were very accommodating. They were able to see him the next day whereas everyone else we called didn't have an opening for a few days. Great clean facility,  amazing staff and doctors.

It was an amazing experience. It was my sons first visit and I was nervous how his reaction was going to be like but, everyone was so friendly that my son didn't seem to be scared or nervous around the staff. The layout of the office was so cute, they had like a tree house theme and my son really enjoyed the tv in the procedure room. Dr. Tran was amazing and fast and gave me good information on the things I had concerns. Overall it was a great visit and my son would be happy to go back!.</Text>

I am sooo greatful for Dr. Chun and his assistant! I needed an urgent root canal done in the late evening and he gladly stayed after hours to fix me up. The procedure was so quick and painless i couldn’t believe he was done already! I was shocked. I will definitely be back in the future and I highly recommend this office and staff. So kind and caring!  I am genuinely so thankful for them! Thank you Dr. chun< /review>

If you have to go through a root canal treatment, you have to come here! This clinic has saved me 2x from emergency root canals that were causing me so much pain. Dr. Chun and his technician Stephanie made my visit today so warming and calm. I'm petrified of needles in my mouth and I will say they made the experience tolerable. No other endodontist/team has ever had such amazing bedside manner. Seriously try them out!< /text>

Nothing short of amazing skills and professional abilities. People who are very devoted to knowing and practicing their craft. Of course no one wants to have to be there as patient but if you need to be there, this is top level practice.</review>

Very attentive to my needs. Very good at what they do. Did a root canal...the tooth cracked so it had to be extracted. So they gave me a refund for the root canal. Very fair in their business dealings.< /Review>

I just got a root canal done by Dr. Chun earlier today and I’m so grateful! I had an abscess in my tooth that was pretty bad, they got me right in, the assistant Stephanie was so sweet and made me feel immediately comfortable and and Dr. Chun was so great, I didn’t even feel the shots! He was patient, kind and just made me feel completely comfortable and relaxed, he really did an amazing job! I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else for a root canal!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The receptionists take care of you very well, they help you, the nurses and the doctor very well, I like them because they speak Spanish and I can have more communication with them, mainly with the doctor.

Walked into the store both people working weren't wearing a mask and they were talking about how COVID-19 is a hoax and just like the flu. They also told me they had a heat bulb in stock and after I drove up there they didn't have it. This was a waste of time and and unsafe shopping experience if you are concerned about COVID-19. I would not recommend this store to anyone.<//review>

Customer service is beyond excellent!
Tony is always happy and very helpful.
I love going in to pet the cats and talk to the birds when i need to grab feeder mice.
Going to miss stopping in to chit chat also.

There needs to be more local owners like Tony!</Review>

This is the only place I'll shop locally after I had a bad experience at a different local store. I have never had a bad experience at Tony's, his prices are good and he's one of the sweetest people I know. Danny is pretty cool too. The store is very welcoming to where it feels like they know everyone who goes in there personally and you don't get that anywhere else.< /text>

I love this place. I have two snakes, and this is one of my go to places. I live in Mentone, so sometimes heading to Yucaipa is easier then downtown Redlands. Tony, is so nice and I really enjoy the store.  Danny, also works there, and they are both so helpful. If they don't have snake food, they call me when it comes in. Finding a business that actually has quality customer service, and follow thru is a rarity these days. Thanks Tony!!! See you soon.<//text>

<text>Tony has answered any question I've had about my snake.  Other places might say, "Google It Up", or "I don't know!".  He is very friendly,  honest, and very  knowledgeable!  His store is clean, and prices are quite reasonable.  He loves animals and can give you great advice.  He remembers you and is very nice.< /text>< pics>

I have been shopping here since I was a child picking up supplies with my mother and now I come in every week as an adult to get crickets and mice for my pets. Absolutely love Tonys pets!

The Cockatoo was very pleased with incoming customers.  11/10 recommend.  Also Tony is awesome. I was sick and tired off all the fillers in pet food,  went to Tony's shop who has a 17 and 15 year old shop cats with no liver disease and healthy kidneys. I asked him what food he feeds them and my cat LOVES it. Her coat is shiny and she looks forward to meal times,  she's no longer hunting as much to make up for the vitamins her Pet Co and Pet Smart food didn't have.  He sells the stuff wayyyyy cheaper than Daryel's pet shop in Redlands (Red Barn Naturals and Taste of the wild). Tony also explained that he only sells his food at a 25% markup to make it affordable for customers.  Yucipa is really out of the way for me but I'll drive 30 minutes to buy from his shop any time I need to restock. He also sells flea medication and worm pills by the pill/ cartridge if you can't afford to drop $45 or $30 on a couple months supply.</Text>

The prices are higher than the grocery store and some of the birds are loud but its a good place. Plus on Monday and Tuesday, he sometimes gets a litter of kittens. I have gotten two wonderful cats from his store over the years.</Text>

I came in on their soft opening and ordered their rose lychee drink! It was so refreshing but a little too sweet. I recommend asking for less sugar if you like your drinks not too sweet.  I also got to sample their taro ice cream and it was sooooo good! I highly recommend giving them a try!</text>

One of our favorite places.  Wish they had iced  blended Matcha Green Tea Boba available.  So many ice cream flavors to choose from. Great atmosphere.<//text>

The strawberry flavor was amazing.   So rich and flavorful!

Isabel let us sample as many flavors as we wanted!   So difficult to choose just one!

I would definitely go there again!
They even have ice cakes! Large and small.<//review>

The ice cream and shakes were really good. I've met the owners before and they are very nice. However, we went in as a family today and the guy at the counter gave bad service. He was very slow and rude. I'm sorry but it takes more than a good product to want to return. I'll give them another chance but it won't be anytime soon.<//text>

<Text>Great place if you have a sweet tooth. This place a an amazing selection of desserts. I only got the scoops with toppings but I do want to go back and try the other items. Also, you can get pints to go. I love that idea. Next time I will try the crocream.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>It's artisanal ice cream, and overpriced. Yes, the flavors are good, the ice cream and sorbets are extremely smooth, like a perfectly defrosted tub of ice cream, and the presentation is great. But, you're paying a premium for this ice cream. This wouldn't be so bad, except that the actual serving sizes they provide are disappointingly small. A single scoop of ice cream will cost you as much a tub of premium ice cream from the store. Two scoops is going to cost you nearly $10.

Service was also quite slow despite there being only 4 people total ordering in the store when I visited around 7:30pm. Can't imagine what the wait would be like mid day in the summer.

Otherwise, it's a cool atmosphere. Well designed, lots of sitting room inside and out. It's a decent date location.

TL;DR: Good, tasty ice cream at a high price, in a modern environment. Small portions compared to other ice cream stores. Would recommend going once just to try it.<//review><Time>1530093810928<//Time>< Pictures>

Small shop offering great-tasting ice cream with a modern and contemporary feel. However, it’s overpriced for the portions you’re getting.<//Text>

The ice cream was good. However, I disapprove of the variety. The variety of the flavors is not as diverse as say, Baskin Robins<//text>

Instead of choosing from 30+ cylinders of premade ice cream, you'll see about 20 ice cream makers churning. While I was there, some were not available quite yet so the selection was slightly limited. The friendly employees offered samples as do the traditional ice cream parlors. To me, the product was very creamy yet lacking in flavor. The January evening didn't help to prevent soft ice cream from melting too quickly. I found that I much prefer regular ice cream and probably won't be back to Churned Creamery.<//review>< gmapID>

Great Honey dew, most flavors are great balance and good flavors. Whether you are into the creamy full-fat or sorbet; there's a flavor for you. Also, haven't tried yet, but specialty drinks are on the menu (flavored teas, blended or bobas).</text>

This place is insanely good. I eat a lot of ice cream and this was probably top 3 ever. The taro Icecream was thick, uber creamy and so smooth. I need to know how they make this. Please expand!<//text>

Very good, very expensive ice cream.  Don't bring your kids here, it's too good for them.  Send them to 31 flavors and enjoy this alone.</text>

Dropped in from out of town for a noon workout and my wife and I immediately felt comfortable and welcomed. This box is huge, has all the toys you need for a great variety of exercises, has beautiful bathrooms, and is clean and professional. If you live in the area, join this gym!! If you are looking to drop in, go check this out! Thanks for a great visit!<//Review>

I've been a client 3-4 months now and it's so exciting to have people see my transformation. Not only that but the strength and endurance i've developed since joining HS&C. I adore my trainers and how they listen to what I want to accomplish and help get me there. Thank you coaches:-)</Text>

< Review>
I was in town visiting my family, and I heard that HSC was a fantastic gym.  See, I’m from Los Angeles and workout at Nerdstrong Gym. HSC seemed to offer similar programming with a nerd atmosphere, and I wanted to be there.
I was pleasantly surprised to find that they do indeed have a very happy, welcoming and nerd-tasting atmosphere.  Their equipment is great, their coaching staff extremely knowledgeable, and Austin the owner is just down to earth, funny, and easy to be around. It was easy to see how that attitude carried across to his staff and his membership.
My favorite part? When a new person comes in for a class,  a coach works with them that first day. I signed up for Olympic Weightlifting, and Kolin the Coach helped me work on the Snatch, which is always been tricky for me in general.  It was a pleasure to work with him as he broke down the movements, and he paid attention to my knee, which has been tricky lately. It’s just the kind of experience I get at Nerdstrong, and I was over the moon to get this experience at HSC. I highly recommend them for anyone pursuing fitness on any level.  Can’t wait to see them again the next time I’m in town.</Review>

HSC is awesome and has been a lifesaver during the COVID pandemic. The gym gives me a place to lift heavy weights (I don't have a barbell and plates at home!) and focus on improving my health and fitness. My trainer (Nick) is super knowledgeable, patient, and encouraging, and he's excellent at putting together a weekly program that challenges me at just the right difficulty level and pace.<//Review>

This gym is awesome! All levels are welcome!! The owner and staff welcome you with open arms; so there’s no need to be afraid! Each coach is experienced and very knowledgeable; so you don’t need to worry about getting injured. I know it’s super intimidating sometimes getting back into the workout flow, but everyone is super helpful! There are different classes from conditioning to strength and the coaches will breakdown each and every workout planned. If you’re looking for a gym that feels like a family, this is the place to be!! Highly recommend this gym!< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I've been going here since the beginning of this year and I have to say, this is by far THE best gym I've ever been to. The staff is super friendly and very supportive. The vibe here is amazing and you can really tell that the HSC team is a family.

I went with the one on one option for training and it has been life changing. Before, I was working out, having a good time, and seeing results but then I plateaued and stayed there. Once Anthony finally got me in the gym, it was a done deal! This is easily the most healthy and athletic I've been in my life! I can't wait for what the future has in store for my fitness journey!

Lastly, If you're a nerd like me. This place is for you. I can nerd out with basically everyone here and not be judged for it!<//text></record></dataset><record>

This is such a great facility. They offer body scans that really hone in on things that your standard scale won't tell you. The conditioning classes are challenging, and after a little over a month, I've already noticed an increase in my energy, strength, and stamina. Everyone here is personable and knowledgeable. If you're looking for a supportive environment for your fitness journey, I highly recommend HSC.< /review>

<text>Coach Ivy is one of the most genuine, fun, energetic human beings you'll ever meet. If you want to be trained by someone who will motivate you, give you a personalized experience, and make time for you, look no further. Ivy is booked out for a reason- She gives people a transformative workout that will help you reach whatever goals you may have.

She really takes the time to listen, assess your needs, and make a plan that will work out with your schedule. She has years of knowledge and fitness experience under her belt. Despite only seeing her  a few times a week, I've already made a huge amount of progress on my lifting and my body composition.

It's always intimidating stepping foot into a foreign gym where you don't know the people or how to use the equipment. Ivy makes this process so much easier and less intimidating- I felt so comfortable with her! I highly recommend Ivy if you're looking for trainer who knowledgable and will help you throughout your fitness journey every step of the way.</text>< pictures>

<time>1588875801713< /time><rating>5</rating><Text>Austin and Hyper Strength and Conditioning has really come through for me during these trying COVID-19 times.  As a person who enjoys exercising in a social gym setting, the cancellation of all my in-person classes was a hard pill to swallow. HSC quickly set up a SIP Zoom weekly schedule and got everyone right back into the workout groove.  Austin is powerhouse producing workout-from-home video content, launching challenges, sharing healthy eating resources and creating virtual gatherings, keeping the community active and engaged and welcoming both HSC members and non-members on this quarantine journey.

The best thing that I can do for myself during these times is to have full control over my physical health and HSC is hand in hand helping me with that, helping me set healthy goals and elevating my sanity level.  I cannot thank the team enough for their support during these times and would highly recommend HSC to anyone who wants to up their health and lifestyle game.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I've been training with Coach Austin since 2010 at another gym. A lot has happened in 8 years, he got his own gym, I moved an hour and a half away from SJ. But I will still go to him for a session when I can even though it is really out of the way.

The thing that I love about this place is that Austin knows how to make a community, and make each person that trains with him feel that they can achieve their goals. That's what makes me always come back. I have never known a coach as dedicated, hardworking, and selfless.

The facility is a geeks dream. I love that it's almost like a playground of fun. Their staff are so accommodating and helpful (thanks Micah for always finding the expo markers for me!)

Thanks Austin and staff for everything!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I was a member of Hyper Strength & Conditioning from 2016-2017 back when I was still living in San Jose and I really wish a branch would open up in LA already!

Austin's style of coaching is very versatile and well tailored to each individual's fitness goals. I had a chance to try out the weight lifting class and the conditioning class, which I both enjoyed even as a beginner. Each day there are different circuits to keep classes fun and interesting. In addition, Austin offers modifications for different levels to ensure each member's needs are met. In other words, you won't ever feel intimidated because the exercises are too hard.

It's easy to get hooked on going to this gym because there's a strong team mentality, where members continuously push one another to do better. It's all about improvement and everyone sincerely wants you to succeed. If I ever move back to San Jose, I will be sure to become a member here again.<//text>

I can speak for a lot of people when I say that Austin is hands down one of the most positive and influential persons you'll ever meet. His energy is always at a 10, always upbeat, and his motivational skills are second to none (If you ever hit a PR around him you'll see what I mean). And he's instilled all of that into the environment at HSC!

The facility is clean, organized and intimate, the coaches can see all the members at all times to help with correct form and answer any questions before, during, and after workouts. The equipment is great, clean, and always organized as well! #1 Gym Pet Peeve is when weights get left everywhere scrambled, that won't be the case here.

I suggest whoever is reading this to do the same as I did and let Coach Austin and his team help you become the best version of yourself with their passion for fitness. I can speak for a lot of people one more time when i say, I can't thank him enough!< /Text>

I started coming here last year May 2016 and didn't know what to expect.  I am actually intimidated by gyms once I see all the muscle peeps weight lifting and showing off their workout.  First time I walked inside Austin's gym for a trial membership, everyone was very helpful and welcoming.  There were no pressure or someone calling your phone almost every damn day and bugging you to sign up from Austin's staff which I appreciated very much.  The gym is small in size,  cozy, and introvert friendly which was a plus for me!  You have the option to take conditioning classes or weight lifting programs that are taught by Austin and his staff.   I've been taking the conditioning class due to some nagging beach volleyball related injuries and working my way up to weight lifting in the near future.  I am also taking it for to get in shape.
So far I had lost 20lbs (with the workouts installed by Austin and proper nutrition) and still working on losing more.  Every member here are super cool to work out with and also very helpful.  The classes are always challenging and pushes you to your limits.  You will never feel alone or abandoned.  They will encourage you to push yourself.   I definitely recommend Hyper Strength and Conditioning to all the underdogs out there.  This is the only gym that I joined that makes me feel appreciated for all my hard work.  Come and check it out!</text>

HSC is one of those gyms that you never really leave because it a familiar environment. Talk to anyone there and you will be surprised just how motivated they are. Classes are fun of course, but they are geared to make the best out of the time you are there. Training here is focused and exciting.

The instructors take their time with each individual. They remember your name! Coach Austin listens, observes and promotes your personal growth through encouraging exercise routines that you don't find at your typical aquarium strip mall gyms. If you are looking for gains, you will find them here and you will find individuals who want to excel just as much as you.

You should give HSC an opportunity to help you develop, grow and get buff.< /Text>

I can't say enough about the atmosphere here. Whether you're a newcomer, a veteran, somebody who's skipped in months, or somebody who goes every day, the sense of camaraderie displayed in each of this gym's classes is second to none. Featured in Men's Health, Coach Toloza is one of the best in the business and while he can be training avengers and guardians, he takes the time to teach the basics and more advanced techniques to people around the greater community, young or old. I can't recommend this gym enough!</review>

< Review>
To put into perspective of how much HSC means to me and why it’s worth it: I drive a roundtrip of 60 miles to go to San Jose and spend a small part of my day at HSC not only to physically enrich my body, but the mind as well. When you make meaningful, life-long connections at a place (in this case, HSC), it’s difficult to just come in and use equipment and do your routine and call it a day. No, that’s not the only purpose of HSC. At HSC, you make and build connections just as much as you make and build your PRs and routines. As the name suggests, HSC houses energy like no other (“hyper”). I come in and get drawn by the energy of new people from all walks of life and see familiar faces and smiles. The “hyper” to me signifies an unconditional and unassuming enthusiasm from coaches to inspire their members to give their training the utmost best and mindful care. The “strength and conditioning” just speak for themselves, as proven by all the unique classes they offer to foster functional training, weightlifting, and many more. I mainly do personal training with Coach Kilo and she has gone above and beyond to surpass my ever-changing fitness goals. Creativity and mindfulness come into her workouts. HSC is family. HSC is one of my homes away from home. Just like a family, we have fun gatherings, as a reminder that strength and health are not one-dimensional, but dynamic and holistic. HSC summons fun and grit in the physical core but reveres the importance of the mind and what it means to live a purposeful and meaningful, active lifestyle. Just recently, they’ve helped me achieve a dream of an opportunity by training me to compete on American Ninja Warrior Season 11! It was in this instance of their unwavering support and energy that I felt like I was at home with family on the day of the competition. It was an effort on their part that I will remember for the rest of my life. I can’t thank them enough. I’ve been driving to SJ for HSC (for 2 years now) not just to escape the hustle and bustle of life but to train to endure the so-called “hustle and bustle” of life. As a nurse, it’s important for me to stay physically and mentally strong and to avoid injury that the labor of the profession often is at risk for. When you want to go that extra 60 miles to attain fitness goals (even when people question the worthiness when they realize the length I go to for exercise) then the blood, sweat, and tears (happy!) are nothing but the product of something worthy and of high caliber! I am HSC (hella so confidently, LOL) Proud!< /Review>

<review>I have been going here since February 2019. This gym is simply awesome. This gym is a bit smaller than what you would expect from a large commercial gym, but what you get here is an experience that you simply cannot get anywhere else. What this gym lacks in floor size, machines, and treadmills, it makes up for with its quality equipment, excellent staff, culture, and community. Because it is a smaller gym, you never feel overwhelmed with interrupting typical gymbros who don't want to let you share a machine, bench, equipment, weights, etc. If you are into power or olympic weightlifting, this gym has all the equipment you could ever need. This gym offers a variety of fun classes for its members taught by passionate trainers who truly put in the effort to maximize your potential. Classes range from conditioning, powerlifting, kickboxing, yoga, and olympic weightlifting. If you want to pay extra for personal training, HSC offers some of the best in the business. Also, you can workout by yourself, but I definitely recommend trying a class here. Whatever your fitness goals are, HSC will help you get there. No matter your fitness level, all are truly welcome here.<//review>< Pics>

One of my favorite gyms I joined of all time. It's on my top 3! All the coaches here are supportive, friendly and fun! They can be serious and mean, too, if you want them to. But what I liked about HSC is that they're
so inviting--including the members! Whether you're a beginner and never went to the gym before or a super athlete that wants to train for American Ninja Warrior or Crossfit tournaments--this is the place (also people in between who is looking to workout during the work week). I also love their fun nerdy workout themes. So if superhero movies, anime, video games or sci-fi is your thing, go check them out! Try out a class.< /review>

< Review>
HSC has been my gym and second home for the past year now. I found them through a very nerdy and pointed Facebook ad. I was hesitant at first, but I'm so so glad I overcame my nerves and went in for my consultation. Coach Austin, Jozelle, the whole staff and team of coaches, and the other members have been so wonderful and welcoming to me.

There's such good energy there, and they keep me accountable for keeping up with my fitness goals. I lost about 20lbs since the start of this year, and gained noticeable muscle and energy. They're in the middle of a revamp right now, (new branding, new gear, paint, etc.), so it's only gonna get better, and I'm so excited for them to grow!< /Review>

I've been working out with Austin, the owner, for close to 10 years. So when he finally reached a goal of opening his own gym I became a member and it's been a fun ride ever since HSC opened.
Personally I've dropped close to 30 pounds over the course of a year and a half. Then again I'm here about 20 hours a week. I'm not saying you have to be here that much but it's definitely not boring. Austin and the staff vary the workouts and classes so you don get tired or bored of the same routine.< /text>

I have wanted to get into powerlifting for as long as I can remember but never had the confidence to even try. The first time i stepped foot in HSC, everyone was so nice and welcoming. The coaches were supportive and helped me lesrn the basics. I am now one week out from my 3rd powerlifting meet this year and there's no freakin way I would be where i am now without the team at HSC. From teaching me the basics, to tweaking technique, programming, and recovery. I love this place. Plus, key card access after hours!!</Review>

<Review>Over the past 5 months, HSC has become "my gym". I feel like part of a not-so-little family here where everybody fist bumps you to say hi and people yell out your name excitedly when you walk in the door. My own family doesn't even get that excited to see me.

Comparing my experience here to tons of studios and commercial gyms I've been to, staff + members + events = amazing community.

STAFF
Austin (the owner) teaches some mean cardio and boxing classes to get you in shape where I almost passed out the first time I went. Ivy will kick your butt in a$$ class and then spend time helping you individually to correct your pull-up form. Kim does all things powerlifting and will hold you to the highest standard as she cheers you on when you bench more than you thought you could. Tim does all things Olympic weightlifting and super patiently tells you time and time again how you need to stop holding the barbell like you're about to mic drop. Myra is the in-house physical therapist and does a weekly stretching class that helps your muscles release through a series of challenging movements (no laying around here!). Plus Arthur, Jessie, Kolin, and the rest of the staff who do an amazing job supporting members and making sure HSC is running smoothly.

All of this matters because I've been to studios where I got yelled at for not following/understanding the instructor's direction. (Thankfully, Tim never yells at me for misreading BTN as "below the knee" and not "below the neck".  -_- ) If you're serious about improving in something, a coach will help put together a customized plan for you. There's even a Facebook group where the coaches do weekly check-ins!

MEMBERS
People actually made an effort to introduce themselves and say hi. I progressed in large part to both getting help and tips from other members and being inspired by watching the gains that everyone else was making. Knowing that I'll be seeing the same set of people 3x a week makes me feel accountable in actually showing up to the gym consistently.

EVENTS
There was an Olympic lifting meet in East Bay recently, and it was awesome to see so many members of the gym show up to support other members who had been training for months to compete for the first time. HSC even held a mock powerlifting meet to help beginners feel good about competing! On top of just meets, HSC hosts holiday parties and tons of social events throughout the year.

A friend tried to convince me to join Equinox (hello, Eucalyptus towels!), but when I went, nobody was there to correct my form or made sure I knew what I was doing. Nobody was chatting between sets about random stuff like the best way to tie up long hair. At the end of the day, no amount of Kiehl's products can replace the community here.</Review>< Pictures>

Its not your average crossfit gym nor commercial gym. HSC offers a wide range of conditioning classes including boxing and weightlifting. Private one on one personal training is available as well.

Equipment is in perfect condition; the gym is spot clean and well-kept. HSC has plenty of weightlifting barbells, powerlifting barbells, bumper plates, and free weights. The staff are all incredibly friendly and welcoming. The coaches are knowledgable, clearly passionate about what they teach.

Both gym hours and monthly price are convenient for college students such as myself since my classes usually end by noon. I started going to HSC in September and I’ve already dropped 3% body fat and gained 3 lbs of lean mass. I feel so motivated and welcomed at HSC. I couldn’t imagine lifting anywhere else.

Highly recommend checking this place out if you’re sick of commercial gyms or crossfit cults.< /review>< pictures>

<text>I never power lifted before coming here and now I love it! The atmosphere is awesome and super welcoming. It's also very motivational as people cheer you on after a good lift!

I mainly take the powerlifting classes because I get out of work late. As a beginner, they show you the basics on the three major lifts (squats, bench and deadlift) and how to have proper form, breathing and etc.

I've done the conditioning classes and boy.. they really work you out! It's cool though also because I've learned some very fun exercises from different coaches. It's great to attend the classes especially when you don't really have time to make your own work out.

I've definitely gotten stronger after working out here and I plan to surpass more expectations</text>< resp>

<text>HSC Rocks! I have been working out at HSC for 7 months and it is awesome. I’ve known Coach Austin since High school and I am happy to see he has followed his dream with opening his own gym. Hard work done right!

HSP is a friendly, positive, and inspiring atmosphere & The coaches are knowledgeable and always available when I am confused with a workout move or need some assistance with achieving the next step with my goal.

HSC is always mixing it up with their workouts and events. It is so fun! Some of the fun workouts/events are archery, dance classes, kickball, sword fighting, etc. I always feel motivated when I arrive to the gym and in return, I’ve gained great results and fun memories. I’d recommend HSC - Open for all ages and all goals.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Having met the head coach/gym owner Austin before HSC, I came into the gym when it started, hoping for the best. I had known him to be an amazing conditioning coach and he was the one who fostered my love of powerlifting.

The gym is nearing its second year in a couple months and I can truly say my expectations have been completely blown out of the water. On the powerlifting side, I have had several coaches mentor me at HSC. I've watched my lift totals rise higher and higher. On the conditioning side, I've had coaches teach me to love the intensity of it all. Conditioning classes are never boring and I've always felt challenged.

Classes aside, what I find to be the best quality of this gym is the community. In every class, there's a sense of camaraderie. We cheer each other on through each set or each lap. When I'm tired and want to sleep after a long work day and commute, knowing that I have a group of friends and coaches at the gym helps motivate me to come in.

So if you're looking for a gym full of qualified trainers to help you reach your goals and members to cheer you on and work out alongside you, come check out HSC!!</review>

Although, I was worried about the cost of membership, my fiancé and I joined after experiencing a few classes! We considered this to be a great investment in continuing our healthy lifestyle.

It was not only the classes that got us hooked, but the overall atmosphere. All coaches, staff, and members are very welcoming and there is a huge comradery among everyone. In my short few months there, I have been challenged by trying new sports, exercises and joining gym challenges to enable healthy habits daily. Coach Austin and staff also create creative ways to keep members active and accountable even outside of the gym. They care about your progress/goals and you feel motivated to put in the work as well.

Also, if you are someone who has trouble coming up with your own workout to do at a commercial gym, then this place may be for you. There is already a workout established for you with no thinking required. You put on a good sweat, challenge your body's capabilities and have fun doing it! I say, even if you are a bit curious, come through and check the gym out, take a couple classes and go from there... though, I think you'll agree that you'll want to stay and join the rest of us who love coming here!

So, for all beginning and experienced lifters, non-lifters, and you want to take your next step towards healthy living habits, come by and check it out! In addition, if you are an aspiring powerlifter, or want to learn fundamentals in olympic lifting...I would highly recommend coming here for all the newbies to these sports.< /Text><name>Sheila Angeles (SheSheBeanie)</name>< Gmap_id>

Clean place with pretty good queso pupas freshly made to order. The area isn't the best and it can be tough to find street parking sometimes, but if you're in the area this is a good place to sit down and have a quick bite that isn't junk food.<//text>

<text>Horrible food! Pupusas are not good, and the cabbage (curtido) is a disaster of poorly chopped cabbage swimming in water. Tamales are frozen and fall apart when they steam them. Never again...avoid! btw sour beans and cheap cheese on pupusa.
No comer aqui! Las pupusas son una vergüenza para llamarlas salvadoreñas y el curtido está que da lastima. Horrible ☹️</text></record>

Popusas are in the smaller side ... but they are very good ... curtido might be better with a little less oregano .. that's just me.... Tomales are pretty bland in taste ... lady at counter looks mad but that's just how she is she isn't really mad ;D ...< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is not what they promise the horrible food they serve the dish as if they will give it to you apart they take a long time to serve you and if you ask them the plateaus they get angry and they answer you in a bad way and dearly better I go to Dennis Mr. owner pay attention in his business

Tried calling in an order very rude didn't want to help i ended the call because I didn't feel comfortable due to being worried they would do something to it. We called in to mountain Mike's and it was very pleasant .... Waterloo pizza guys not a good place to order from< /Review>

We've ordered pizza here many times and have nothing but good things to say about it. Really great prices.. free ice cream with orders over $20. They accidentally messed up our order the last time and they made it right no questions asked.. let us keep the extra food plus threw in an extra side sauce for free. Don't let the area fool you.. this place is a gem< /review>

Pizzas was not ready, called several hours in advance.  Had a conference with many hungry people.  Once we got the pizzas they were good.  I wanted to change from the normal pizza place we go to.  Now i know to just stick with eddies pizza down the street.<//Text>

Fast friendly take out pizza!!! So good extremely comparable to to Eddie's Pizza in taste but the sizes are much better for the money...one time I had to stay late at work and the location on Waterloo agreed to wait to make my pizza as close to 10:00 p.m.on a night they closed early so I could serve my kids a hot meal that night. How considerate was that!?!?..NO  one tops that service,,,,,< /review>

One of the best franchise pizza restaurants in Stockton by far. The manager is easy-going and knows how to treat his customers and you can tell by the sales awards displayed in front. I've been coming here for years and the quality of the pizza and other items on the menu never stray from excellent.  It's not in a great neighborhood but there's plenty of parking and your order is always ready on time.<//Text>

< review>
After ordering pizza from this place many times, my online order was canceled due to "being out of delivery area".... same address, same distance from store as all my other orders. I will also mention that this was a "second chance" for them since my previous order was "lost" and not delivered. I had to call them on that one. Customer service strike out !!!!<//review>

Pizza is always greater, my lady needed to go on line and saw they had Did I and asked if she could use it but no one knew the password so the girl said she would turn on her personal hot spot for her to use. That was great. The best thing yet was one of the silvery drivers came back and handed each one of the two girls $5.00. Said he got a $20.00 tip and he gave them part of it saying that it's not possible without them to make everything work. Now that is teamwork! Good workers and coworkers are so hard to find. Keep up the great service pizza guys, I'm truly inpressed!</text>

We ordered from this place because it was the only place we could find that would deliver to our hotel.  The service was friendly enough and fairly fast.  We ordered a Hawaiian pizza which was ok, but the garlic cheesy bread we ordered was really bland.  It didn't taste like it had any garlic on it at all.  If we had the option, we would have definitely ordered from Dominos or Pizza Hut instead.< /Text>

< Review>
Want to give a shout out to the night crew; Rosol, Isabel, Anthony, and Danni!

Matthew helped fix a problem today and said,”quality drinks = happy customers “

Alicia (I may be wrong) was also very helpful and apologetic.

Idk who started the drinks but the first time around they were way off.

Thank you guys for fixing it!</Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Even the idea of Jamba juice makes my mouth water. The problem with that is that actually eating their smoothies isn't always what I want it to be. It's pretty hit or miss but on a hot summer day, a hit feels like a home run. Super delicious. But when you are really craving a Jamba juice and it's a miss, it can be the most disappointing experiences of your life.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1553357472777, 'text': 'Tanner thanks for the feedback!'}< /resp>< GmapID>

Excellent customer service. I love the fact that the staff knows  majority of their customers by name and also knows their orders. The staff are always smiling.  I have visit many different Jamba juice but the customer service that O receive from here  keeps me coming back.< /text>

<Text>I ordered a smoothie and the cashier was really rude, i asked her to type in my phone number because i had forgot my phone in the car and she told me she cant do that but they do it all the time when i dont have my phone on me. Then Omar poured my smoothie and i noticed it wasnt blended properly so i asked him to please blend it correctly and he slammed down my cup and said its good. I asked for his manager and his name. My smoothie of course had to be re made because it wasnt blended at all just like i told him. This location has a bunch of kids who have no work ethic no respect and smart mouths.</Text><rating>1</rating><GmapID>0x808e345a4bbf0fe5:0xecd33ca37939bd2a</GmapID><user>115680183185295460601< /user>< Name>

Staff is nice, service is fast and friendly, and the drinks are good. Only complaint is that the location is improperly aired after the use of cleaning products, which can be off-putting for those with sensitive stomachs.< /text>

My 9 year old daughter and I walk in and ordered. Rap music was very loud on which is, whatever.. but it was NOT family friendly. F this and F this .that . I swear i never hear so many Bi*** and N-words in a song before. I asked them to turn it off and the girl said it wasn't her music
... Took 5 minutes for someone to turn it off. Ridiculous.< /Text>

What a surprising treat. We try and support local businesses as much as we can so we decided to try Ristorante Amoroma. We arrived at 6:15 on Saturday and were immediately seated by a charming host.  The food was delicious and the service fantastic, for a reasonable price.  We paid $76 for 2 cocktails, 1 appetizer and 2 entrees. The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars was not due to the restaurant  but to the couple bringing a screaming toddler to a cozy dining establishment where it was clear couples appeared to be having "date night" or at the least an intimate dinner night out. This place is a must try but not for young children/babies in such close quarters. Lastly, a bonus, they offer a lovely brunch on Sundays.  I am looking forward to trying out their brunch offerings.< /text>

We ordered a salad to share and we each had a pasta dish. I had the fresh fettuccine with seafood. My fettuccine noodles came waaaay undercooked. I asked the server if they could make me a new one because it just didn’t taste well...my server insisted that the noodles were cooked “al dente”, but trust me I know and can tell the difference between al dente and undercooked pasta noodles. She, the server took my plate and I’ve waited for 15-20 minutes (to be exact) for my new seafood pasta. OMG, to my surprise, they didn’t make me a new dish, they literally put my dish in a microwave and just heated it!!!! I could tell that’s exactly what they did because I had half eaten a shrimp and calamari from the old dish I had originally and they’re back on what’s supposedly my newly made pasta fettuccine with seafood!! And what’s worse was that my dish tasted nothing like how it was originally. I seriously felt like eating a chef boyardee straight out of the can food!  I mean look at the photo! I told the server about it all she coulda ay was “I’m so sorry” oh and btw, here’s your check! I don’t think I can ever go back to this place.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm6rSjJuB67NOoKlgb-lVTeJb4SKl5VOxV7MUb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

Love this locally owned restaurant.  It's been a couple years since we have been here.  Nice to see some new items on the menu.
The farfalle was delicious as well as the seafood pasta special.   Need to come here more often!</Text>

It is disheartening to read some reviews that bash the restaurant and servers. I admit that there has been turnover in the service staff and that many of our long-time favorites no longer work there. Despite this we have always found the service to be adequate at worst and the food and ambiance to be excellent. The owner, Hafiz is almost always on site and supervising all aspects of restaurant. I always recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for a lovely dinner in or near Moraga!</Review>< Pictures>

Ameroma is one of the fairly few fine dining options in Moraga. The staff is friendly and the setting is welcoming and usually politely quiet. While the food is fair, the high prices prevent the overall experience from being special.< /text>

Er Pollo a La Diavola
half free range chicken roasted with garlic, rosemary and lemon; zucchini, spinach, and mashed potatoes

Is what I ordered... a boiled chicken thigh with half breast and chicken wing.  Then Pan seared to turn browned on the outside the flavor was in the sauce not the actual chicken. Didn't really smell or see the Rosemary and for $23+ my pallet was not impress.

I guess the the fancy italian menu didn't live up to its expectations.< /review>

We were able to get in for a last minute birthday dinner. Service was very friendly.
Appetizer - calamari and also the polenta with mushrooms were both good and satisfying for a table.
Dinner - Pasta dishes were excellent. Lamb, filet, and veal parmigiana were also very good. Salmon piccata was just okay (needed more sauce/capers and only a few veggies included).
Dessert - Tiramisu was outstanding, but the  chocolate lava cake had a solid center and the flourless chocolate cake was a brick.
A few items requested never arrived (milk for child and coffee came after dessert). Over all would return for a date night, but not a party over 4.< /Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Went to fill up one of my propane tanks and it only needed 2 gallons to fill it. I wanted to make sure it was full so my wife could use the fireplace all night if she wanted. I went to pay and the guy tells me there is a 5 gallon minimum. He said there is a sign outside that states it. I went out to look for the sign and you could barely read the sign. I couldn't believe it. So he charged me $18 for 2 gallons of propane. I will never go back to this place again. I usually go to the 76 station where they have no minimum, I will go back to them.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Equipment has never failed during use. New Equipment is frequently delivered. Equipment delivery is fast and the staff is professional. I've been using them for approximately 8 years now, both personally and for my business. Mom and Pop service with the professionalism to back it.< /Text></record>

As part of my job I have to fly into different cities and load heavy equipment onto trucks. I contacted Simon Rental ahead of time and explained my needs and reserved a forklift. I can't say enough about their helpful and courteous staff as well as the equipment which was in pristine condition. Thanks for making my job go smoother.< /Review>

< response>
{'time': 1615236561367, 'text': 'Good afternoon. Its unfortunate that you might have seen the "owner"\nwithout a mask. However since the start of the pandemic the owner and staff have taken every precaution the CDC has advised to stay safe at our shop. The only time we take our masks off are to eat and drink and that is in the employee break area. We have been diligent throughout the past year to keep our employees and customers safe and we will continue to until the mask mandate is lifted.'}</response>

We recently had a really good experience at Simon rentals. I wasn't expecting much - we just rented a scissor lift for the week. It was delivered on time, worked perfectly all week, was picked up on time, and was reasonably priced to boot. I had checked on renting from some major 'chain' rental companies, and Simon made it so much easier that I had to go with them. Thanks to Jon and Stuart for the help, and especially to Jon for going above and beyond in offering me additional aid when my Hilti concrete nail gun went south on me at the worst possible time. We'll be back in the future.

I live in Belmont, and this location has been my go-to spot before work in the morning. However, I’ve noticed that younger employees have been hired. These individuals, for the last two months, have consistently gotten my order wrong. I also noticed a lot of joking around, flirting, and even horseplay behind the counter. This needs to be investigated immediately as this is unproffessional. We all pay Starbucks prices at this location, but we have definitely not been recieving quality service. Thanks< /Text>

Fantastic little unpretentious diner. Pancakes were tasty and good texture, home fried potatoes awesome with just the right amount of onions and peppers. Staff was really friendly and attentive without hovering. Only downsides are that it is located right before freeway on ramp and no real Maple syrup (would be nice to offer it as a side for an extra charge).<//Text>

<Text>I went to get coffee today around 6:45 PM, and I ask for some room for milk. The barista gave me the cup half way (she charged full price of course). When I asked to fill a little more she said they were running out, and didn't have any more because they were closing in 15 mins.
What kind of service is this????
Is this new from Starbucks????
Really????
Hopefully, this is just one time thing. I get coffee from this store every day because I work very close to.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4LmHfzunkxKtsSYgYuZcDrIO37LblJG6-GlDD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2UYDohPczsf3bqjmsypWTsZBZe77ZBWhlQjPo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f9f66a738f173:0x883f75b5d99930eb< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

As expected, although the social distancing setup is not not ideal... and more than a few patrons seemingly not smart enough (or too entitled?) to follow them.<//Review>

Stopped by this afternoon and ordered two drinks: a hot tea and an iced coffee. The store was not busy, but with only two people working the service was  extremely slow. The iced coffee came immediately, but I waited for the tea for  over 15 minutes. I  had to ask  the whereabouts of my drink because many other customers with more complex drinks were entering, ordering (not online orders), and exiting with their drinks before me. The person making the drinks ignored  me when I asked twice. This person was VERY busy (the only one actually making all the drinks) and I could see how hard they were working, so I asked the person at the register. Their attitude was not welcoming and even seemed annoyed that I asked after patiently waiting. I told this person that they need more people working. I was not trying to be rude- just stating the obvious, but this person's response was full of much attitude and eye rolls. They proceeded to tell me that they were sick with food poisoning from the night before and at least they came into work. I asked if there was a manager I could contact and they would not give me a name. I asked if there was a number I could call to complain and they literally said, "call whoever you want, I don't care".  It's unfortunate that me as a paying customer receives treatment like this. I can see if I was rude to the employee, but I was not rude or disrespectful....I am disappointed with this location, and this is not the first time. This Starbucks is always so understaffed- with waiting times of over 15 minutes for simple drinks. Writing a negative review online is is not a common occurrence for me, but I am repeatedly dissatisfied with the service.

Hopefully management can staff more effectively. It might decrease employee stress on the job.<//text>

Above average Starbucks.  Located in the Carlmont Village Shopping Center.  This is an independent location that is separate from a grocery store.  When I arrived the store was not too busy.  The merchandise and food was well stocked in the afternoon.  Service was friendly, quick, and helpful.  There is lots of seating inside and outside.

They have a Clover machine and Nitro cold brew.  Need to work on cleanliness of condiment bar, tables, walls, and floor.< /Review>

<user_name>Brandie Smith</user_name><Response>None< /Response><text>***update*** A year later and they are just as disorganized as ever. Today I ordered and paid for a Venti drink and a Danish not warmed up. I got a tall drink presented to me with a Danish that was warmed up. I swear they are in a hurry to get it done that they don't stop to listen to the customer. They were so busy that I couldn't tell them what I got was wrong so I just took it and left. The wrong drink is new but they always get my Danish order wrong - every time even though I make it extremely clear not to warm it up.

***Original*** Seems to be a very disorganized compared to much busier locations. Food is often forgot about and orders are often messed up.<//text><date>1562344793401</date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I need to start by saying I've visited Homewood once a year for the past 2 or 3 years and loved it. This time, however, it wasn't the best, although still good. The staff were nice as usual,  although I had rather few interactions. My biggest complaint was the lack of value compared to the other big resorts in the area. The cost is about the same as the other places, but there are not features to match. They even charged to park as well as for the RFID cards they use now for lift tickets. They only have one high speed lift, and it's not the first one you get on. The first one was painfully slow. There is only one restroom up on the mountain even though there is a lot of terrain. So, not my favorite experience this time, but gorgeous views! And, there's a lot of great terrain.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8YR7WChMXaoH1kfwkAfk3_lKSwoYEot2CBqsA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONgjQvgpruGJkVcb3fDpjCnaD6R20CbgDR9VG-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

Although it has been over two decades, since I have skied here, I had a great time doing so!  The vista, the snow, the runs, all where so enjoyable!  The staff (back then) were helpful and had a great attitude about their work.  I had damaged a ski boot and the ski shop refitted my bindings, to accommodate their rental ski boots, so the day wasn't a total "wash out".  Hopefully the staff is still as accommodating and helpful with a positive attitude.  Here's to visiting again soon!!< /text>

I loved it here! There weren't a ton of people, the views were amazing! Lunch and drinks at the Big Blue View Bar was the best! A little flat and slow in certain parts, especially as a snowboarder. Also, free for military, which was really cool!</Text>

<text>At first I was skeptical of Homewood because it’s relatively small. But wow the views were stunning. No crowds. No lines. Much of the snow is untouched because there are so few people. Really enjoyed.</text>< Pictures>

Dylan is a phenomenal instructor and extremely patient! He made us feel so comfortable and adjusted to our learning levels. The resort itself is so gorgeous, awesome staff at every encounter and a wonderful atmosphere! Definitely will recommend and it doesn't matter your skill level.< /text>

Amazingly family-friendly, we taught all our 4 kids to ski here on the bunny slope with the magic carpet. Small resort in a way, but way less crowded and short queues compared to the big ones. Parking was a breeze, the walk from the car to the snow is super short. Lastly this resort is much bigger in terms of hills than you'd expect, and there's something for every skill level. One thing to note is that few of the chair lifts have a safety bar – it didn't bother me a lot, but I imagine some would feel unsafe, especially if bringing kids.</text>

We had a really good experience today, good snow, good weather, very few people, and we loved the runs. There are great green and blue runs with spectacular views from top to bottom. I broke a binding at noon but was able to rent replacement skis within 10 minutes. It really saved our day. Thank you! -Auntie Finch< /text>

<text>My friend and I went this weekend and I had an amazing experience. Thankfully we had an instructor because it was my very first time snowboarding. When I say Dylan was phenomenal!!! He was very patient. He would take videos for us. He went above and beyond. I could barely stand on the snowboard when I started, but by the end Dylan had me doing turns and going comfortably down the medium mountain!! The resort was very clean and everyone was friendly. The bar was great too!! I highly recommend this resort...and ask for Dylan!! :)<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>It's a really good place to start, some lifts are closed and some others are really agresive when it comes to speed to jump into the lift, if you don't mind about that the rest it's really good and the runs are so pretty with the tahoe view.<//Text>< gmapID>

I expected a lot more out of this resort! We got there early and it was clear they hadn’t been groomed the night before. Although they said they had 5 terrain parks, which later changed to 3, only 1 was still up and to call 4 rollers a “park” is a stretch. The easy runs back to the parking lot had large areas on dirt and mud that at times weren’t avoidable (I got as many scratches today as I got in this entire season of riding about 30 days).</review>

This one is my favorite mtn. I have a season pass at boreal because it is the only one that goes from 9a to 8p so I get to ride during golden hours.

But I still purchase a ticket to Homewood every now and then because I love the view and being able to have lunch and a beer up top. It ALWAYS feels like I have all the trails to myself. I hardly ever meet anyone who has been here and it makes me happy because less crowds but also...yall are sleeping on this one its a gem.<//review>

<Text>Omg, I almost posted a fake one star review because I don't want anyone to FIND this place. It has the best possible view of the lake, totally unbelievable. The terrain isn't very extreme, and there's some really mild stuff for beginners. The conditions were really nice today mid-March 2021. They're not very strict with mask enforcement. It was not crowded on a Tuesday, there are probably like 60 people on the mountain...

My family of four went to Homewood three times this season.  Two of three times we were treated rudely by the parking attendant just for asking where to park and falling when getting off the ski lift. We tried it again after the first event but, we will not be returning to Homewood after it happened again.  Ski lift operators should be sensitive to children getting off the ski lift.</text>

Home wood resort is not a beginner friendly ski resort. Main chair lifts are too steep for beginners even with stay on green lines. Worst of all, the two platters for beginners are not always open. My family was here for two days and both platters are off both days. They indicated the lines are open and when we arrive and see the lines are not operating, they would simple change line status. If you’re beginner, be ready to pay ~$100 a day and only be able to use magic carpet. Won’t visit again.< /review>

This resort is a joke and a total scam they completely lied to us and would not refund us. On their website and on their snow report they said that there was 3 active terrain parks with at least 5 features in one them this was a lie there was one active "terrain park" that had one single feature and that was 5 rollers. We went in and asked for refunds for our passes because of this and they would not refund us. IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!< /text>

I don't know much about advanced snowboarding, but it was very begginer friendly. My experienced friends seemed to also have a good time.<//text>

Beautiful mountain!! Some of the nicest staff I've ever met. Excited to be apart of that now! Tree runs, different terrain, a park when there's more snow. Oh don't forget about sledding too!! Absolute wonderland.< /Review>

If I could I would have given zero star. This ski resort is not ready for 21st century. Non refundable and non-reschedulable tickets. Never been to this one but from the comments this ski resorts is not for intermediate to advanced. If you want flexibility other ski resorts Including North Star, heavenly, etc are great!</Text>

< Review>
This place is horrible. They say they have 5 terrain parks, but when we showed up there was zero. It was a huge disappointment. We tried to get a refund, and they said "terrain is subject to change". They did not refund us. Their daily snow report said 3 terrain parks were open. This was a complete lie. This was the worst experience at a ski resort I have ever had. I would not recommend this place to anyone. They are misleading and lie. Their customer service is nonexistent. If I could give zero stars I would.<//Review>

This has become our favorite family skiing destination. Small resort with some nice runs. If you want double black diamonds you will be disappointed. But for runs that work for the family this is the place to be.</Review>

Look, if there's snow at Lake Tahoe, then do yourself a favor and skip the lines at Squaw and go to Homewood Mountain Resort. Bring the family and enjoy the small-time atmosphere. The people are nice, the instructors are patient, the runs are beautiful, and you can't beat the views of Lake Tahoe from the top. West shore, Best shore. I read that on a license plate holder, and at Homewood it appears to be true.< /Review>

<Review>Definitely a good place to skiing. We got lessons for that and instructor was good, funny. A good place to start if you are new to skiing. However, they don’t have any medical support or supplies. They don’t even care what happened to you and don’t even provide a medical attention or help until you’ve doctor’s prescription or something. How someone is supposed to get that on mountains after hurting him/her self? Definitely need to improve on this side.< /Review>< pics>

We hit traffic on the way up. Like a dead stop for 45 mins. We called the resort and they were kind enough to reschedule my toddlers snow play for the next day, however, they didn't refund my daughter's or husband's ski lift tickets, even though they weren't able to go up/down the slopes. That burned and disappointed me. We spent so much money on snowboard lessons, ski lift tickets and rentals. What a waste of money and expensive trip.< /Text>

We've been here twice this year since the season start. My son and I took ski lesson. Kid ski class are separate from the main area  it a little down south in Tahoe bowl there are shittle bus run to both place every 5 minutes. My kid loves his teacher Gretchen has been very kind to him and encourages him to jeep on skiing. The whole day lesson cost $165 including Lunch and snack from 9am to 3:30pm I'd recommend to book them in advance.

Adult ski lesson is $65 if you book in advance plus rental gear 10 am - 12:30 pm I took lessons with Ramsay and Cindy they were both such great teacher.

Overall we enjoy coming to Homewood so much basically base on the price and uncrowded especially in the week.</review>

I have to give Homewood five star ever since I first came to this location I have constantly been coming back every year. It's always a great experience I've been here with friends and family very roomy. Weight for beginners intermediate and experts whether you're snowboarding or skiing you will definitely have a blast. These pictures that I posted were from the last week the resort was open in 2018< /Text>

Great value & good scenery at top of Mountain. Terrain was good. One drawback is limited green trails. Homeward Bound trails has a lengthy flat stretch which is a drag. I would go back to do blue trails</text>

{'time': 1548173337877, 'text': 'Hello and thank you for learning how to ski/ride with us at Homewood. We\'re pleased to hear you found much of your visit pleasant and genuinely hope you had a great experience with us. We hear your comments about the Happy Platter "poma" lift and will be sure to pass them along to our team. Another terrific option for similar terrain is our 2-mile long trail "Rainbow\nRidge". Spanning peak to shore, this is another great way to enjoy the mountain. We hope you visit us again soon for another on-mountain experience.'}<//Response>

Beautiful views. Slopes are decent. Definitely stick to the slopes on the north side as they're longer and more technical. The bunny hill lift is the stupidest lift system I've seen. It's supposedly like riding a horse but then this horse has some ungodly drive to completely grasp your nether regions and legally violate you while you're dragged into the ditch at the side. And then you have to shamefully walk back up while the 4 year old learning to ski laughs at you.
Closes too early.<//text>

<Review>Much cheaper and less busy than other resorts. All the blue hills are on the harder side of blue and there's not much of a transition from green to blue. Good for a good intermediate skiier or better. There's a nice long green Hill that's let's beginners see the beautiful view from the top though.</Review></record>

I really enjoyed my time at home wood. However despite the amazing views I don't think this is the place I would recommend teaching someone new.

Apart from the magic carpet the only other "lift" that was offered on the lesson + lift pass + rebtal was 1 janky T bar that was not well groomed that I sat and watched more than 50% of new skiers and boarders fall off for 15 minutes.

We luckily had a second day booked that was just lift tickets + rental which allowed us to go to the top of the mountain where we had a lot of fun and a good drink at the bar.

I must however give this place 2 stars as I find it highly deceptive to sell a 'lift pass' that does not include any lifts.< /review>
<Response>{'time': 1555021410440, 'text': "Hello Connor, we're glad to hear you enjoyed much of our resort including the views and on-mountain food & beverage offerings. We're sorry to hear that there was confusion relating to our Learn-to-Ride lessons and regular Focus on Four Lessons. To provide the lowest price possible to those who are interested in learning for their first time on skis or snowboard, we offer a $69 Package that includes 1/2 Lesson, full day surface Lift Ticket (Magic Carpets and Poma lifts at the base), as well as rental equipment. This package is structured as such because first-timers are likely going to stick to the magic carpet lifts to learn the basics. It sounds as though you would have best enjoyed a Focus on Four (beginner or intermediate level skier or rider) Lesson from the beginning of your visit. Again, we're sorry to hear about your confusion here, and recommend speaking to a member of our team before your next visit so we can best accommodate your trip. Please feel free to reach out to rmcnamara@skihomewood.com if you decide to visit again."}< /Response><user_name>Connor Walker</user_name><userid>104461256370495704121<//userid>< Gmap_id>

Great place. Staff was super helpful for my friend who was going up for the first time. Views of the lake a terrific. It's definitely got a good little kids' area. The blues we did were fun but the trails kind of ended in ungroomed fields on one side of the mountain. My two friends had a great time hitting up the bar, and I liked my (standardly ski resort overpriced) veggie burger.< /text>

Very nice, smaller ski area with a friendly feel. Seems like the locals frequent it. Lower rates for Seniors, starting at lower age than others in the area. Go to the shop early because it closes shortly after the lifts do. Snow wasn't great when we were there, but another skier said it was a great place when they'd had a little more fresh. Best views of the lake of anyplace we went to with seating and a DJ at Big Blue where we had lunch on the mountain.< /text>

A very nice group of people. Everyone was in a good mood and today was an awesome day on the mountain. I took a lesson and my instructor was great! I spoke with some of the other instructors and they too seemed like a good group of people. The mountain was a lot of fun and it wasn't busy (which always makes me happy).

Buy your ticket online and it's cheaper.</text>

<text>It was okay because there was not any new snow. It was icy and slushy and made it hard to ski on. It is a small Resort but the 4-year-old ski lessons were wonderful! My daughter now wants to learn to ski more. We've been back Sunday and they were making snow but when I turned my ski equipment in the person behind a desk ignored me and I had to get his attention in order to turn it in.< /text>< pics>

They have a great lake view! I wouldnt recommend it for beginning skiers as it only has two green courses, which makes the path icy and crowded. But the view is always gorgeous.</text>

<Time>1595723380765< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I'd say Homewood has the best views of the lake of any resort. And it has cheaper lift tickets than the big resorts. The runs are pretty good too. They also have 5 dollar tall boys. Hard to beat that. So for the value and view it's one of my favorites.< /review>< pictures>

Decent resort that is super convenient. It’s really close to Lake Tahoe. It’s quite small and lots of the runs are short and can get quite crowded. It’s worth a visit for the views.< /review>

<text>Fun place to visit and brilliantly priced for lift tickets, rentals, and lessons. There were plenty of options for any skill level of skier or snowboarder. The park was well maintained and the map was fairly easy to read. If you book online in advance you can get some really great deals.

However, I had some gift cards and wanted to use them to book online  but there is no option to use them in the checkout. I called several times and the phone was never answered.  I called the order helpline and the woman couldn't figure out how to do it either. She also called the resort and got no answer. I did eventually get a call back but it was 10 minutes before they closed and I was at work and couldn't answer.

The lessons were cheap but rather short on time and some seemed better than others. The instructors were very friendly but all seem to work at different paces. One group would advance rather quickly and thoroughly, making sure the students could perform the maneuvers with some accuracy. While others seemed to rush through the steps and pushed forward regardless of whether the students were ready. So I think there needs to be some consistency between the instructors and perhaps a lesson curriculum for the lessons.

Overall it was a great time and I will definitely be visiting Homewood again. I would recommend this place for beginners through advanced skiers and riders and for people of all ages.</text><Date>1546977700590</Date>< Rating>

Our friends who are locals told us it's the best kept secret in Tahoe, and they were right.  The major crowds go to the bigger resorts on the other side and miss out on this little gem that has a gorgeous view of Lake Tahoe as you ski down.  I'm more or less a beginner, and their lessons and teaching area were perfect for me.  I spent the afternoon on the lowest of the bunny slopes learning what the heck I was doing, but even down there the view was spectacular.< /Text>

Great view of Lake, but those Green routes are a bit tough for beginners. We needed to use shuttle to get back after we skied down from Green route.< /Text>

<Review>What a wonderful ski resort. Especially for beginners. Excellent instructors and not very crowded. It is smaller than a lot of the big famous ski resorts but that's what I loved about it. Every staff we met was really good.<//Review><userid>105822035271445102827<//userid>< Rating>

<name>George Tarasenko<//name><text>If your into powder and long trails thru the forest, this is the place ! Homewood has be a favorite for my cousin and I for a couple years now and never disappoints. So many trails to choose from. Jan 26 we went after a fresh coat of powder but even with the recent snow there was some bushes sticking out. But that just made it more challenging and fun! Also great place to go with the family. The staff is always friendly.</text>< userid>

I came here hoping to ride some park features (just one rail would have made me happy) and when I got my ticket the daily conditions report said there park had 4 features but when I got up there no rails or box so i went to costumer service and was told that the daily report was correct and I was wrong so I went up and checked again and there was not 4 features so I went back and they where is it unwilling to do any to try to make their error right so my planned on exciting day was very disappointing and they being in the business of trying to make people’s day happy 😢 the ticket price this particular day was 154$ for one day of skiing ⛷ and also I would say their grooming was less than desirable due to the fact that it seemed they only groomed half of their mountain the night before I wished I had went up the road to alpine 😢😢😢</text>

<Review>This place is sweet! Got good deal on tickets from liftopia and it's a short drive from the bay area. I will definitely be coming back to this place. Only things were the cafeteria food was a rip off and they only had a way to get down on blacks otherwise you had to take a lift or a shuttle. All in all it was good.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The prices are just okay, the drive to get here sucks & the parking lot is small & filled with potholes. The whole building is outdated & cramped. I felt like the bathrooms probably wouldn't even be up to code. Has a great view from the top but it's definitely not for beginners.</Review>

<text>Great skiing, short lines, and all time views. We had a great time, unfortunately Ellis lift was closed for the season due to mechanical issues, but we knew that before hand and they had shuttles running from the south to north areas frequently. We never waited more than 5 minutes for a shuttle.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPu1jtwYHrMS4ltJJbzowZmZ1Hj5d8JQygDxoah=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

A few of my friends and I went up there for Lincoln's bday weekend. There were a lot of people on Saturday but it had cleared up quite a bit by Sunday. Got in a couple of solo runs in the morning. While some parts of Cali were getting record breaking wind speeds, this mountain stayed pretty chill. Good views, good vibes< /text>

Although the terrain offered in this resort is fantastic, the mountain itself is poorly operated. Trails are never properly groomed, chairlifts break often, specially on powder days or when the resort is crowded. I'm a Season pass holder and after they just announced that Ellis Chair will be closed for the season,  I will not be coming back. Oh, also, they refuse to issue refunds to season pass holders even if the main chair that gives access to their best terrain is BROKEN FOR THE SEASON. Never again, Homewood. You could have done much better.<//text>

Better for intermediate to advance skiers/boarders.  Get your discounted tickets online before you get there.  Preferred Heavenly, Squaw Valley or North Star.<//Review>

Not beginner-friendly at all. The only one green trail is too steep. My friend and I finished the track in "only" 3 hours, mostly by walk. Just avoid this place if you are a beginner and have no confidence in you skill.< /Review>

If you are an experienced skiier, you would get bored with the amount of runs. Great for beginners though. They don't have lockers so you have to haul everything back to the car.< /review>

Homewood is a wonderful gem on the West shore. Deep powder, epic tree runs, friendly staff, and top notch views. Also, a great value if you buy your tickets in advance. The staff makes the resort run, and you can tell they enjoy what they do. Big shout out to Ross! He helped us really enjoy ourselves!<//text>

If you want have fun skiing, this is the place you should visit. I'm a beginner skier and I can tell that the staffs at Homewood Ski Resort are professionals and also friendly. Had an AMZING time skiing at Homewood, I would recommend this place 100%. Plus, the view of Lake Tahoe is beautiful.< /Text>

New to the sport and was glad they had two bunny slopes to learn how to ski on, one is about 50' run with a conveyor belt to get up and the other is about 500' with a pole between your legs. Took about three hours to get the confidence to go on the lift.< /review>

<text>There's only parking for like 50 cars, so don't come up and ruin my retreat from big crowds. The views of the lake are like no other, it's about a 170° view. Stop by the summit Cafe for a beer and maybe a snack and enjoy a great view of the lake on their porch.

Some of the best trail riding though the woods, great powder when it's good. Careful though, you can get lost in Backcountry.< /text>< response>

<Text>Great resort for me to get back on skies after almost 10 years. I liked the green slopes and   even some blues. The snow was fabulous and everything was beautiful. It snowed on and off all day. It was perfect. The place was small and everyone was polite. The staff was  good and the food was ok with a variety of choices.

Their website and customer service are inferior to neighboring resorts, like Alpine Meadows.  We tried to book last night for today, and the website stopped responding.  This morning, they cannot find evidence of the website not responding, so they won't honor their own prices.  Ski day canceled.  Nice views on the slopes though.

<Text>Love coming to Homewood. It's not as popular as the other Tahoe resorts but that's what makes it the best. It isn't so crowded and it isn't that expensive. The people and the pow are top notch too. Prepare to shell primo moolah though if you decide to eat here, so I suggest you bring a cooler for lunch.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Been riding at Homewood since 1997, and 2017 should be a record year.  Sadly, it's the worst year ever.  Nothing's open on a powder day, and nothing's groomed on a groomer day. Absolutely falling apart this year. Services cut left and right (no mid-mountain bathrooms or food?! Really?!?) Won't be a passholder in the future. Please JMA, sell this mountain to someone who actually wants to run a ski area.

UPDATE: They vastly improved last year (2017/2018). Seemed like they actually hired a couple of people who knew what they were doing and wanted to work. A lot more like the good old Homewood I used to know, and really, you canNOT beat the view.<//review>< pics>

<text>Great powder day, in a Saturday, and no lines. Mountain was pretty fun to ski on. Would suggest upgrading Ellis lift to an Express, as old Homewood right now is the only Express they have and Ellis chair takes forever to ride, add the terrain there is amazing. Anyway, good alternate around Tahoe from the big expensive ones<//text><Response>None<//Response>< Rating>

Great little resort. Nice runs, not to demanding, perfect for a short weekend. Price is great, $60 for a ski pass book ahead of time online and $32 for rental gear (in Tahoma). Big Blue bar is a great place for break and a beer after a few hours of hard work on the slopes!</Text>

No frills snowboarding. Needed to use shuttle to get back to South side of Mountain. I'm sure it will be better when whole mountain is open. It is inexpensive that's a plus.</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>My family has a house in Tahoe City that has been in the family since the 60’s. My family and I have been frequenting Homewood since I was a child or for the last 35+ years, and I have always loved it.  This year I thought it would be a good time for me to get my 3 little boys to my favorite spot to teach them how to snowboard. I taught for 4 years at Northstar while going through college at UNR. So I paid for lift tickets for me and my three boys online for Monday, December 30th, with nothing on the website telling me that the tiny magic carpet at the bottom of the mountain was going to be the only thing open for them. Both rope tows were down for “routine maintenance”, yet I didn’t see anyone working on them. I was very disappointed and would have been able to get the same or very similar experience at the free public sled hill by our house in Tahoe city. I paid about $450 stayed for about 3 hours and never even had an opportunity to strap my board on fully. The magic carpet is so small there is barely an opportunity to get one turn in before having unlatch get in line again. Very inefficient, ineffective and not a fun way to learn the sport in my opinion.  I tried to bring it up to the manager on duty (unfortunately I didn’t catch his name) but he didn’t seem like my concern was valid and wasn’t interested hearing me out or that he even cared that I was disappointed.  In the short time we were there I can also say that I spoke with 4 or 5 other groups that were very disappointed for the exact same reasons. I provided this input to the resort on two separate occasions and didn’t get any reply whatsoever. I won’t be back, nor will my family and friends who I will be sharing this experience with. Don’t want anyone else wasting their money and ruining an experience for young skiers/boarders like we did.<//review>< Pictures>

<date>1579583544219< /date><Rating>2</Rating><Review>I'm on the fence about Homewood, it's a great resort for beginners and learners in my opinion as it has great greens and blue runs to learn and practice your techniques but for slightly more advanced skier's it is terrible, the lifts are slow and the blacks are either the equivalent of a hard blue or an ungroomed hard blue and they provide little challenge. I also call into question the quality of the maintenance that they perform as the most important chair (Ellis) was shut down for half a day because it couldn't handle the weight of a full load of people riding up to the top, that isn't just maintenance, not being able to complete its only objetive is a design flaw. The safety is also an issue as half of the lifts lack a safety bar and creak as they make their ascent. Additionally, as a result of the lack of safety Ellis and Madden are incredibly slow. Ellis was also stationary with riders on it for over 30 min  before they got let the riders off of the lift while I was there. The other issue I found with the resort was the fact that some runs were marked as blacks on the map but when arriving at the runs, they were marked as blues (ex. Jimmy's Run). That being said, the lake views were amazing and the pictures you see will not due it justice.< /Review>< pictures>

Due to the season, most routes are icy, and I realize that the resort can not control the weather.

However, one thing that can be changed is the organization. Unlike other resorts such as Northstar, Homewood poorly organizes ski lift lines. This resulted in a bunch of delays, plus a lot of minor injuries.

Also, grooming could be improved. I’m no double black skier, but I can tell the difference between good and bad routes. Again, some things you can’t control. Perhaps the crowds ruin it too quickly.

But overall, still worth the visit! Just be aware this isn’t the best of the best< /text>

<Text>When we arrived the power had been out for half an hour. The staff was friendly and offered to give refunds if it didn't come on in another half an hour but luckily it came in within minutes. Amazing views of the lake. The Big Blue View Bar halfway up the mountain is a major plus.< /Text>< Pics>

Snow conditions were poor so not a fair review for skiing. Staff is friendly and helpful. Resort is at first confusing. Lessons are all given by Spanish speaking foreigners. Lessons at Dodge Ridge infinitely better. Given by locals. Shuttle service is great. Traffic is horrendous. Leave by 4 AM to get there and to go home; otherwise, you'll join the slow pilgrimage back to the bay area. Super pretty. Decent lift ticket price. Bring your own food. Convenient parking. Worth a try.< /Text>

I have been skiing since I was 3 and now I am 50. That includes a year in Colorado as a ski bum as well as skiing in Europe.  Homewood has become our default resort when we all go to Lake Tahoe. (we have skied at over 80% of the ski areas here) it is smaller than most but still large by East Coast standards. The staff is so friendly and the prices are reasonable. The views of the lake are unbeatable. It is very family friendly too. You can't go wrong by coming to Homewood.</Text>

Homewood is a no frills place--simple to park and get on the slopes quickly. As an intermediate skiier they have more than enough routes for me, and I appreciate their lower cost lift tickets...highly recommend getting tickets in advance through Sports Basement!< /review>

It used to be the bargain ski resort in the South East shore of lake Tahoe at less than half price for a daily ski lift ticket compared to others in the area. Not any more. Considering there smallish area, limited runs, lower elevation (therefore shorter snow season), the new prices take off the main appeal of Homewood.<//text>

If you're reading these reviews, ignore 99% of the complaints. As a LONG TIME ski resort insider, everything that goes on at Homewood from non-transferable tickets to "the scary meter ledge" in the beginner area is all perfectly normal. I live on the other side of the lake and I've always enjoyed an occasional trip around to hit up Homewood in a good season. If you're a beginner, the easy runs are going to seem a little more intermediate than you might like. If you're an expert, unless Quail is open, you're going to be a little disappointed with the groomers but the trees at Homewood are super fun with adequate coverage. Homewood is a very basic mountain, though they're planning a great deal of upgrades. Homewood has been a long time local-knowledge mountain and even with the planned expansion, it might be safer for totally inexperienced skiers bringing the whole family up to Tahoe from...oh I don't know...let's say San Jose - to go ahead and save their patronage for the I-80 boiler plate resorts. Whether you're local or a vacationer, though, if you're more interested in skiing than shopping and you're looking for a mainly intermediate hill, Homewood's the place. You'll also be hard pressed to find better views of Tahoe at any other resort.

Ignore the negative reviews. They're either from people who have little to no experience skiing or people who are used to being catered to non-stop. Tahoe is not Vail and we never will be. We're here to cater to people who love their respective sports and we do it exceptionally well everywhere in the Tahoe Basin.< /review>

Medium sized ski resort right across the street from Lake Tahoe. The runs go right down to the parking lot so that's nice. The service was very friendly. Lower elevation made the snow a little slushy after midday. Not the best place for snowboarding as there are a number of narrow, flat areas and you have to do some climbing coming off the lifts.<//review>

Some of the best views of Lake Tahoe.  If you're buying tickets online, this place is a great value, especially for a family.  Doesn't have a ton of beginner runs, but a really good place if you're an intermediate.  Yes, the facilities are dated, but everyone is friendly and helpful, and assuming you stick to the express chair, you'll get plenty of runs in an efficient manner.</Text>

Tiny parking lots. We spent 20 minutes convincing employees let us into the parking lots and there is actually spaces. Compare to other ski resort, I might choose bigger one next time.</text>

We'd like to reassure you that our teams were working hard to provide convenient parking to our guests for the day.

<text>We had an awesome good time here! Lots of fun. ALL the staff were extremely warm and friendly, very accommodating and helpful. That goes for the folks in the ticket office, ski rental shop, sporting goods store, ski school, lift operators, kitchen and bar. Special mention for Elizabeth,  Andy Tania, Justin, Jim,  Marty and Stephanie I love that it felt like old school family style skiing, not the impersonal cattle drive you'll find at the big resorts. For a small resort your PEOPLE are the winning combination.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80997fda4762005f:0x73b0c46aa0c1068d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been going to homewood for years. Most people tend to head over to squaw but this spot is right on the lake. The views from up top are incredible. This place has more of a rustic feel than the bigger resorts but the runs are great.</Text>

Loved it. This is where locals come to ski/board. Great variety of trails for all skill levels. Easy and plenty parking. It is usually not crowded here unlike larger resorts. Family friendly. Food court is so-so, but if you want something little more upscale, there is a great restaurant just across the street. Rental place can be crowded in the morning, so come early. We bought tickets online - there is a separate line to pick up tickets which makes it quick. Will come back for more skiing fun!< /Review>

I love Homewood. It's never crowded, the views are amazing, and you don't feel ripped off.

Yes, there are bigger mountains with steeper slopes. But if there's enough snow, Homewood is always my first choice.</Text>

Always opening late it seems. You should be ready to load by 9am. Doesn't seem that hard.

Very simply solution: Start setting up earlier.

Ill increase stars if you start to load on time.

Have some discipline!<//Text>

I searched all over South Lake Tahoe for ski and snow boarding lessons, for my 4 nieces and 4 nephews.  This was their first time in the snow.  I didn't want to spend alot of money on skiing and  snowboarding lessons and equipment.  I would say this was the best deal, for lesson and rental equipment.  An hr into the ski and snow boarding lessons, the kids were already tired.  They took a 30 min break, then they went back to practice.  Bring snaks.. Kids will get hungry.  There is a snack bar, but a bit pricey.  Great instructors! The mountain was perfect for beginners to practice, without spending an arm and a leg.</Text>

Nice smaller resort.

Lift tickets aren't closing in on $200 like Squaw-Apline and the big corporate spots.

Great views of the lake from the lifts and on the mountain. Good variety of terrain.

Small, but fun bar with great staff for apres ski relaxing.<//text>

<text>Like most of the mountains here in Tahoe, It's relatively small. The skiing is still great though, and you won't be waiting in line. The only negative thing I have to say about Homewood is the food is way way overpriced, even compared to Tahoe.< /text><time>1552907816719< /time></record></dataset><record>

<date>1546895384798< /date><Text>The main distinguishable feature of this ski resort is a very nice view to the lake Tahoe and mountains around. Any picture taken there can be a post card. They also have some very wild trains through the forest, I mean labeled trails not just someone decided to ski there at their own will. The main disadvantage was that many trails were ungroomed, pretty much all diamond trails were ungroomed. It could be due to weather and lack of snow also but I would prefer to have more well groomed trails.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>I'm torn on this. The mountain had great terrain, and I had a lot of time in the woods, v there was lots of snow. The infrastructure though is abysmal. There's only one express lift, and in the sides of the mountain you have to take 2 lifts to get to the top. The lounge is tiny and the food is overpriced even by mountain resort standards.</Text><rating>3</rating>< response>

<review>One of my favorite mountains in the Tahoe area, I've been boarding here since I was a kid. There's plenty of back country and you can make your own trails all day long if you like. Staff is always friendly and it's one of the cheaper mountains around. The view of the lake is a spectacular plus.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This 5 star review is based on our ski team experience at Homewood.

For anyone who is looking for a ski team for his/her child, this is the place to be. The coaches Deedee, Josh and Jenefer are positive, engaged and enthused. They are professional and work well with all parents and children.  They take the time to make the team fun and at the same time, teach each child new skills.  They take the time to follow up with parents before and after each session.  They go beyond "oh, we had a good time today" or "your child did well."  They make sure the parents get to know one another. Kids of all ages have become friends with one another.  This has truly become a mini-community. Everyone involved is extremely welcoming.  There are no egos.

We hope Homewood recognizes the coaches' professional expertise and experience.  At times, we do wonder if there is recognition on how much the coaches offer to this program.  With their years of experiences, Deedee, Josh and Jen could probably coach at  a larger resort; we feel so fortunate they are at Homewood.  One can easily tell they love what they do and they are good at what they do.  We hope Homewood recognizes their level of experience and parents' levels of gratitude.</Review>

Caution-exploits location. Poorly marked hazards and a ski patrol staff that seems not to care. Slow lifts that only run half of the time. Very poorly groomed and not a decent park to speak of. Their food is a real crapshoot.< /Review>

<review>I would not recommend Homewood for a beginner due to the lack of terrain that is easily accessible from the lifts.  For an intermediate, the resort is great.  It is less crowded and offers some great opportunities to maximize your ski time.  The biggest downside is that most of their lifts have not been upgraded and are pretty slow, and there aren't that many lifts on the mountain.  The mid-mountain "lodge" is really a very large tent that provides good shelter and packaged food (they grill outside on sunny days). Bathrooms are outside which requires a bit of a hike down an incline and up some stairs.  It's a family resort with reasonable prices and friendly people, so don't expect 5 star accommodations, but what they have in place is adequate if you aren't a snob.<//review>< pics>

<text>Not worth the money. Dissapointed on arrival. Old infrastructure is not reliable and the bunny slope lift is hard for peolle to hang on to and causes delays when beginners and little kids cannot hang on to it. The main trails are more steep than other mountains. The other trails are narrow and have no views. Not coming back here.< /text></record>

We reserved a private lesson for snowboarding in a month ago but resort folks arranged us a ski instructor instead. They didn't treat this issue seriously either, just arranged us to join with group lessons. We informed instructor Steve that what we booked is private lesson, not group lesson, then we wait another 20 minutes for another instructor Brad. Both of them cannot provide the help to my wife, who is the main person needs for instructions. She felt so upset and the only way she could do was giving up this class.
The slope is also not friendly to beginners, no chairs in the beginnings zones.
For the green lines with chairs, they are also narrower than other resorts. I didn't see any fence around the cliff as well. Not recommend for kids and beginners.
The only pros is it comes with good view, but all the others were bad to us.<//text>

As a beginner snowboarder who only goes once a year, Homewood is very easy to access and affordable! You don't have to drive up any windy mountain roads or trek a mile to the ski lift. You can see the mountain from the road. Parking is easy and the ski lift is close to the main cabin.

I would definitely return. Although I would recommend renting equipment elsewhere, since it was quite pricy. I only needed a helmet for a day, and it cost me $29.<//text>

Even if there is a Winter Storm Warning issued  by National Weather service within 24 hours prior to the ski date which basically suggests that all travel to Tahoe is dangerous and it is better to avoid it, the Homewood ski resort will still refuse to reschedule. This basically makes the customer choose between money and his/her risk tolerance. Very unpleasant!

We had scheduled adult ski lessons which consist of lift, equipment rental and lesson itself. I do understand that the lesson might be a bit hard to reschedule, but I think it is pretty easy to at least allow rescheduling of the lift and/or equipment to another day. Instead, if you are not willing to risk travelling, you will automatically lose $139 value per purchased lesson all together. Sad.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Worst customer service I have ever experienced. They are just out for your money. We had morning ski lesson reservation with them but due to a massive snow dump overnight they had a delay opening and did not email or communicate with us how this would impact our lessons. We called their guest services line over 30 times until we finally got in contact with someone to try to reschedule for the afternoon session. Then when we arrived for the afternoon lesson we were turned away because they were at capacity. We tried to explain we had reservation for lesson but they didn't care. So we called to try to get our money back and the manager (Ross) refused to give us our money back saying they do not refund because of weather but the weather wasn't the problem the fact that they turned us away was this issue. He wanted us to rescheduled but we repeatedly told him we were only in town for the weekend and were leaving that evening but he didn't care and clearly just wanted our money. Save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else where they don't try to scam you out of your money.</Review>

Very disappointed with this ski resort. The only star is for its views. Stunning views, but failed tremendously with its ski business. Went here two days ago, on new year 2017, the terrain is full of hail size snow balls . The slopes are not maintained well, it has many tree/shrubs mixed with the "snow". This place has butchered my snowboard. The management has entirely missed the idea of a ski resort.<//text>

<user_name>Deja Kirkwood<//user_name><Time>1343590282889</Time><rate>5</rate><Text>Smaller ski area with about 4 big ski lifts that take you way out of commercial Tahoe, for a more zen happy-to-be-here experience. All the services you'd expect including rental gear, lessons and a small indoor lodge area with beer on tap at the base. Can't give al 3 stars because the facilities at base are limited. My 8 year old sis enjoyed the beginner terrain park. There are usually 3 parks; easy medium and difficult, so its a great place to learn new tricks. The price of admission is fair at much less than the larger resorts. Also I must say Homewood has the best photo opportunities above Lake Tahoe.</Text>< pictures>

After they took our payment of $329 the sales girl at the counter then tells us we have to be here an hour and half early. We decided to cancel right after she told us that but she refused to us to cancel without paying $50 per person because they have a 24hr. cancellation policy. This is highway robbery. If we would have known about their "policy" and would have known about the early arrival we would have thought twice about booking the lessons since we are staying 1.5hrs away. They ended up settling our cancellation but had to charge $50! Unacceptable- not to mention only 2 slopes were open!.< /Text>< Rate>

I went to Homewood with my family for "Homewood Days", a summer festival featuring free paddle board and Mtn. Bike demos, historical presentations, and family appropriate bluegrass music, I thought.  :(. After a day in the sun, and an extremely poor turnout, we looked forward too an evening of relaxation and enjoyment at the concert portion of the event. What a disappointment. When I went to pick up our tickets to the show, I found out they were not going to let us leave the show for 6 hrs! Lock-up with our car 100' away. If we tried to go get our jackets or let the dog out of the camper for a few minutes, we would have to leave. Tahoe gets chilly in the evenings, & I also needed to go out to the car for a little while to ice my foot. (It still swells up and gets stiff & sore after being on it for several hours because of a broken leg I suffered 3 months ago). I complained the event promoter for the resort & he gave the canned, un-sincere apology, & refused to be reasonable. He even lied to me about the reason why they would treat their guests like middle school kids at the Fri. night dance. He said it was a public safety issue. Really!? This so-called family event had a safety issue?! The real reason was because they wanted to "Force Sell" food & liquor to their "guests", a phenomenon all too common in the Entertainment business. What a disappointment for my family. I even showed up with a pocket full of $20 bills, prepared to buy their over-priced food & drink...That is, until I found out there was going to be a greedy squid following me around with his hand in my back pocket. Never again. Not a dime. Shameful dis-trust of your guests. Not a dime!</text>

A smaller and more intimate Mountain than Squaw Valley/Alpine or Northstar, they have some nice to terrain and are very conveniently located if you're staying in North Lake Tahoe.< /review>

<Review>It truly amazes me why people are skiing Northstar or Heavenly and overlooking Tahoe Gems like Homewood. This place is rife with Tahoe Magic. Best views of the lake, PERIOD. Tree runs for daze! Freshies a week after a storm. Along the crest, so they always get big dumps. Quail face is steeper than all of Northstar. A relic of Tahoe's past- back in the day when a family ski vacation was pulling up, throwing skis on the kids, bringing a sac lunch, drinking beer with the staff in the lodge, and cheap lift tickets. Yes, they dont have 5 star accomodations at the base, or a f*ing ice rink, or overpriced drinks at a bourgeois cocktail bar, and thats a good thing. Get back to the soul of skiing, and homewood is where you do it. Tell your friends, cause we need to keep this place in business...< /Review><date>1481503443168<//date>< gmap_id>

The experience was great!

I visited Homewood on 12/30/2015 with my brother and another family friend. After arriving at about 11:00 a.m., we parked at the main parking lot which was conviniently located at the base of the slopes. Parking was short, but additional street parking was offered. Within five minutes, we had bought out lift tickets. Unlike Boreal, the crowd was managed very well - the crowds were same as Boreal but no lines were present.

After ten minutes, we joined the bunny slope line in order to warm up. One bad thing about Homewood is that the bunny slope lifts are simply poles hanging from a cable which you have to hang on to. They are slow, single rider at a time, and difficult to use. We then went to the Madden triple chair, which was unfortunately a Yan lift. These lifts are unimaginably slow, hard to board, and have no safety bar. This lift was slightly faster and much easier to board than other Yan lifts, but the ride to mid-mountain took about 9 minutes.

We skied for hours riding the advanced blue slopes and trying out the terrain park. The view was excellent, and the trails were groomed very well. The resort had an excellent mountain, with a bunny slope coming all the way from the summit to the base. Blues of different levels covered a large portion of the 1200 acres, many of which provided as a transition from green to blue and blue to black. Double black diamonds were also located at Homewood, offering a great view of the lake.

We rode the Old Homewood Express, which was the best express chairlift I had gone on. Within 4.5 minutes, we were at the summit. The blue slopes were perfect, with a right mix of packed powder and loose powder.

The Ore Car trail, which serves as a connection from the mountain to the North Lodge, was narrow, icy, and neglected. The sign pointing to the trail had fallen down, and a long uphill stretch was required in order to reach the slope. If you want to ski from top to base and do not want to ski on a black diamond, take the Lombard Street Slope. Unfortunately, you cannot ski at high speed down a small section of this winding slope, but it is an excellent slope for all levels, as it is wide and groomed very well.

Overall, Homewood was a great resort offering views of the lake, excellent powder, and a large variety of trails. I also liked the ski school and the cafeteria. Homewood is an everyone's resort, with trails ranging from beginner to expert. Visitors and non-skiers can walk all the way up the bunny slope and give instruction to their kids. I think Homewood is the best family resort I have been to. I suggest that if you want to go skiing and are any level below extreme expert, Homewood is the place for you.</text>

Beware of parking signs.. hard to find those signs and if you park along with others on the side of the road.. you will get a parking ticket.< /Text>

Facilities are extremely dated and there are very limited food options here. They ran out of snowboard rentals by 10:30am. The employees are also very unpleasant and unhelpful. Thanks for an awful experience, I'll take my business back to squaw or anywhere else.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I want to return! We arrived in the afternoon and there was no room for classes, so we returned another day after booking online classes and equipment. My children enjoyed it very much. The very professional teachers. In our next vacation in this region, this place will be the first on our list, but we also want to see it in the summer it must be impressive😉
