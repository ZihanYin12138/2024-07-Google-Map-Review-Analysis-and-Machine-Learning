Great service! They were so professional and friendly and took them no time at all to create two new car keys for me. Great prices as I called a few other to compare and they were indeed the best. I had my kids with me and they were so friendly and patient. 10/10 would recommend. :)<//review>

Quick and reliable, came out on short notice on a Saturday for a lockout and couldn’t be happier with the service. Friendly and trustworthy, I’d recommend A+ for all your locksmith needs.<//Text>

Super fast and friendly guys. I went to the Robertson location to copy house keys and got referred to the other Olympic location for my Honda key fob. Both experiences took under 15 minutes! I don’t copy keys often but I’ll definitely go here next time I need it.<//Text>

<Review>Firstly, a person, an actual live human being, answers the phone! *
They were recommended by my daughter and the price seemed reasonable for an Infiniti key fob. *
Got to the shop and they didn’t have the correct blank so I ran another errand and pretty quickly received a call that they had retrieved the part and to head over *
I walked my dog and by the time I got back, the key fob was ready *
The part was a little more than originally quoted but they kept to their word and honored the quote *
That adds up to five stars! *****<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< Review>
We locked the car keys inside our trunk with no spare key! They came out to our house so fast they were extremely polite and a pleasure to talk to. Within 15 minutes they figured out the solution and implemented it in under a half hour. We will definitely be calling them again should anything of this nature arise. Thumbs up all stars!!<//Review>

Not only great customer experience but learned a ton about keys! Most importantly- they are very very responsive. Walked over after hours- got in touch with manager, all handled first thing the next AM. Even was accessible via text WITH follow through— who does this??!</Text>

< Review>
My bike lock jammed and I needed to get my bike off of a fence. I told the owner how much my property manager told me I'd be charged if he called a handyman to remove it. The owner told me he'd match that, and he stuck to that even when the chain turned out to be thicker than he anticipated. He had to bring in a specialized angle grinding kit, but he got it off quickly with no problems. I'm grateful this kind of service is available during the nationwide quarantine.< /Review>

They are so amazing and so professional. They made the car keys with remote like as original one.
Their price is so reasonable. I highly recommend it.</Review>

Got a plain house key copied. Guy was polite, let me have the key for free as a "thank you" because I pointed out that his camera wasn't set up correctly and because he didn't want me using my rare $2 bill to pay when the debit card machine failed to work. Strange interaction but I can't complain.< /Text>

<Review>I lost my car key and the dealer said it was going to be almost $400 to get a new fob/reprogram, etc. I bought a fob with a key off Amazon for $29 and then Nir at A+ reprogrammed and cut  it for less than a 1/3 of what it was going to cost at the dealer. Super fast, super friendly, super easy - in and out in 15 minutes. #ShopSmall.< /Review>< rate>

<review>What an incredibly efficient, Professional Place. Really go out of their way to give Quality Service in a very time sensitive manner. Have a full range of tools for any kind of key, even Advanced Multi-Locks. Did something that would take 24-48 hrs in a matter of 3hrs. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE WHO WANTS THE JOB DONE!!</review><name>Matthew Abikenari<//name>< rating>

The dispatch was able to contact a locksmith (Myles) who arrived at my apartment very quickly (approximately 20 minutes).

I have gone to A+ security for several things.
I have had keys made for cabinets that I had broken the “only” key I had.
I only had one key for my 2017 Kia Optima, and the dealer in Carson was not helpful. Nor, Ben and Josh had the key and worked to get it programmed....quicker and cheaper than the car dealer.
They have Covid-19 protection gear and all kinds of items for personal protection as well.
The owner and his associates are friendly, helpful and very competent , Josh is a really good guy and if he can’t answer a question.... he connects you with the “Big guy” to get you what you need. This is a key shop and more.<//text>

<Review>Our car key had broken in half from our vintage car and they managed to create a new working copy, and continued to help cutting several new copies until it was working properly in the car again. Great to have some honest people willing to help and make sure everything turns out right in the end. Thank you again< /Review>< Resp>

I called the shop and the owner Nir was closed. He told me that he would come and meet me at the shop. He called a little while later and allowed me to meet to get keys made. I was so grateful because I was in a bind ams really needed a key made. Very quick and very helpful and professional. I’m very grateful. Thanks again A+.</Text>

Ben seriously saved the day yesterday. He climbed through my car trunk like a ninja. He gave me honest advice on the best ways to solve my multiple key related problems. Plus, he gave me some extra safety tips that were super helpful. He even picked the pieces of tree branches out of my hair that were the result of me climbing through my apartment window.

Not only did he fix all my key related problems in record time, he was funny and a pleasure to be around. I was kind of freaking out when he arrived and was 1000% calmer when he left. Thanks again, Ben.<//Review>

He’s sweet, funny and pretty good at his job. I can’t thank him enough for helping me out when I got locked out.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Tom was great! He came 10 minutes after I called on a Sunday. He used the pick method, so we didnt need to replace our keys when he's done. His price was much more affordable than the 3 other locksmiths I called.< /review>< pictures>

< review>
I’m glad you guys have a list of great reviews because this is one extremely dissatisfied customer. I called Friday evening due to my trunk being jammed. A worker by the name of Ben Levi came to my house to fix the issue, or so I thought he would. He aggressively tried tried to open my trunk with the key like some kind of mad man and it didn’t work. Then attempted to make several other keys to try to continue to do the same thing. Nothing was fixed. After that, he disassembled my car door to find the coding to my key through that. Which didn’t work either. He told me he was running late for an occasion, so assuming he properly put everything back I just retrieved his contact info and told him I will contact him on Monday. I woke up the next morning to find out my car door was jammed. Good thing I accidentally left one of my back doors unlocked or I would be screwed out of a way to get to work. After I arrived to work, I called this company and their worker repeatedly to get them to come to my job and fix the issue. Ben eventually picked up the phone. He sounded hungover. I told Ben that he improperly reassembled my car door and I need this issue fixed immediately. All groggy he said I will be right there and hung up. I called him back to give him the address to my job and he failed to pick up the phone. Now just to let you in on how disappointed I am, I have never wrote a review on Google in my life whether someone provided good or bad service. I have been pushed over the edge to even consider doing this....

I called you at 9:05 am on 07/21/18

You called back at 12:05 pm trying to correct the situation.

I gave you until 3pm and you were trying to talk to Ben. Forget what Ben is doing, make the situation right and you didn't I had to go to work and you failed so don't try to make out like the victim... Overall poor service.<//review>

<review>Reasonably priced, fast, and honest. I needed a spare key made for my car. Inside of an hour, Nir was able to figure out what kind of key I needed and how to make it. It would've been even faster but he needed to have the right part brought over. He didn't try to upsell me and was stayed focused on what I needed. He was professional, polite, and definitely made me a return customer.<//review>< user_id>

The miscommunication was with the first technician I sent out ( Ofir )and me . He is new with the company and only knows how to open cars, not make keys for them . This is why I sent Ben out the second time . There was no way I would have allowed him to charge you a penny over the $85 discussed . We strive for great service And I am sorry we have let you down .

I am disappointed by the service I received especially after reading so many other favorable reviews of this place.

Recently, my bag with my Prius key was stolen. I had my boyfriend call A+ Security Lock and Key to get a quote (reviews at other dealerships suggest women are charged higher quotes so I had him call to avoid potential issues).

They informed him it would be $85 for a vehicle lockout to open the door to the car. When they sent their servicer over (30 mins later, very punctual) to open the car door, he told me that it would be $240 to open the car door. I asked him why this was nearly 3x the quote given to my boyfriend. He tried to explain to me that it would have been easier to open the car door if the key were inside the car???

After speaking to his supervisor, the service man again told me it would be $240 to OPEN THE CAR and another $300 for the chip key. After some back and forth haggling, the servicer agreed to lower the fee to *open the car* to $150 because of a "Google discount" (lol) - i.e. using Google and not Yelp - complete nonsense. I then spoke to his supervisor  who informed me that my boyfriend had not told him that I needed a new key and that I just needed to get back into my car. I still asked why it would be so expensive to open my car to which I did not get a clear answer. I again asked the service man why it would be easier to open the car door if the key were inside. Can someone explain this to me?

After some haggling (I don't remember all the details) the supervisor informed me that he would put me in contact with a different "ignitioner" to assess the scenario and give me a quote. When I talked to the different ignitioner (Ben, he was perfectly nice and reasonable) I explained how they initially quoted my boyfriend $85 and then saw me and tried to charge me $240 to just open the door - no key!! He said he was very sorry about the situation and would give them a call and I could expect a new quote. The supervisor called back and said that he could get the door open a get me a new smart key for $285 total. I don't know if this is a good price but considering it was half of what they were initially trying to charge I accepted.

After Ben arrived, there were no issues at all - he got the door open in 2 minutes (he did not seem bothered that there was no key inside).  I had a new key in about 20 minutes. Thanks Ben - you're a cool guy.</text>

My favorite place to get keys made, buy accessories and call them when I get locked out of my apartment. They are super friendly and affordable. The employees there are soooo friendly and patient. David is really great, professional and helpful. Ohh and their open 24 hours!!! Thank you A+ security for being my #1 locksmith spot in LA 👍😉< /Text>

<review>Thank you Steven for saving the day!! Been dealing with an insane ex and crazy roomate drama. My house is old school so all of the locks have been extremely hard to change. I have been struggling to find someone willing to give it a try. But Steven was more than up for the challenge! Not only did he change all of the locks, but he also did it in record time with a great attitude. Will definitely be contacting him in the future!< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>My go to place for locks! You are treated respectfully. They are professional, honest, and they make you laugh so any wait time there whilst working on your lock will go by fast!

I had a complicated lock situation--a vintage cylinder lock that needed to be re-keyed. Nir worked dilligently with the complex and partially rusted mechanism replacing the pins and screws and cleaning it until it was resolved.

I have used their mobile services in the past and this time it was their other location on Olympic that I used. They really know their stuff. You can come to these guys with confidence!

** As to pricing...over the phone I was quoted at $39 but this was before Nir ever saw my lock or even was able to ascertain how complex or problematic this lock was. I actually walked away paying only $38 and with 3 keys which we'd never discussed. To calculate the man hours that went into resolving my lock situation I know that I walked away with the better end of the deal!<//Text>< pics>

Locked my keys inside my car and called, I was able to jimmy it open before the locksmith arrived. He was understanding of the situation and said his base price would be the same and offered to make two spare keys. The price was just his standard visit and the keys were worked great. He also gave me a hide a key box.  100% would recommend and will call APlus locksmith if I ever have a problem again.< /Text>

Excellent Service... Was visiting Los Angles and playing on Venice Beach with my family. I lost my keys in the sand. Where are the metal detectors when you need one. Bill from APlus arrived opened my car and used codes to create new keys for my car.   It is frustrating to lose the cars to your car but these guys were prompt, minimum wait till they arrived and very professional.  I highly recommend them to be there when you locked out of your life...  Yes my wife was laughing at me for losing the car keys again...</text>

<text>Excellent Service... Was visiting Los Angles and playing on Venice Beach with my family. I lost my keys in the sand. Where are the metal detectors when you need one. Bill from APlus arrived opened my car and used codes to create new keys for my car.   It is frustrating to lose the cars to your car but these guys were prompt, minimum wait till they arrived and very professional.  I highly recommend them to be there when you locked out of your life...  Yes my wife was laughing at me for losing the car keys again...</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Called for a quote for a routine service for business records in the area and was quoted $500 for a $50 service. Very odd.
Update: the man I spoke with called me back to ask me to remove my review, which I would have done gladly if he was not so incredibly rude. He told me he quoted me the $500 because he did not want to do the service, which he had told me. I had previously asked if he had a referral for someone else in the area. A completely normal business practice. It was not that he didn't want to do the service, that is not a big deal but if he let me get a word in edge wise, the conversation could have been a lot more professional. Making inappropriate noises on a call. I have not had this kind of experience when looking for vendors before.< /text>

What a life changing event! We had  tried for years to serve and went to several different servers who knocked on the door and left! But Robert of Vallejo Process Servers took initiative and waited outside all day until the evader came outside to get in the car and was served! Caught red-handed! Best process server in town in my opinion the others are lazy, but Robert was creative, patient and persistent, and it paid off!< /review>

<Text>I tried calling this place to inquire about their services. I started talking and the guy immediately hung up on me. He called me back and I merged him on my other call. He asked, why do you have me on a conference call? I started to answer and he hung up again. Had he let me talk, I could’ve explained the reason for him being on a conference phone call. I tried calling back again without the other person on the phone only to find out I had been blocked. I’m assuming this guys name is Robert because of all the other reviews. Robert, you are a very rude person. You passed judgement without having any facts. This is horrible customer service.

Edit: This man called me at 7:20 pm tonight 10/11/2020 threatening me to remove my review of my experience with him. Saying he is going to sue me for slander. I rated my experience with your business. You cannot sue me for anything. You should learn how to exhibit  better customer service.<//Text>< Resp>

And yes, I will sue you. Gave you a chance to remove the review, you didn't.

What a life changing event! We had  tried for years to serve and went to several different servers who knocked on the door and left! But Robert of Vallejo Process Servers took initiative and waited outside all day until the evader came outside to get in the car and was served! Caught red-handed! Best process server in town in my opinion the others are lazy, but Robert was creative, patient and persistent, and it paid off!</Text>

I started talking and the guy immediately hung up on me. He called me back and I merged him on my other call. He asked, why do you have me on a conference call? I started to answer and he hung up again. Had he let me talk, I could’ve explained the reason for him being on a conference phone call. I tried calling back again without the other person on the phone only to find out I had been blocked. I’m assuming this guys name is Robert because of all the other reviews. Robert, you are a very rude person. You passed judgement without having any facts. This is horrible customer service.

Edit: This man called me at 7:20 pm tonight 10/11/2020 threatening me to remove my review of my experience with him. Saying he is going to sue me for slander.

Excellent and professional service. Vallejo process servers got my papers served very fast. They open much later than the usual process server's. I live in Las Vegas and all I had to do was email them the documents and in very short time I got back confirmation that my papers where serve. I reccomend these guys 100%.<//Review>

<Text>this place did a great job on my husbands window tint, however we came home and did not drive the vehicle until the next day. when going to pick our friends up from the airport we noticed that his marine corps cover was missing out of the vehicle as well as his Oakley sunglasses. when i called the place the ask if they had misplaced them or know what could of happened to them they denied and laughed at me. his cover was sitting on the dash and his sunglasses were in the passenger seat. very unprofessional business. the $500 we paid is now going towards his new cover and sunglasses.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Had my Tesla Model 3 tinted here. Service was the best.
I've called other shops but they were not able to do my car was I wanted.
Tesla has a huge back glass on rear and I guess that was the most difficult part of the vehicle but they did took in and finished my car like jet.
They also had a tesla charger? so got my car full charged and left with perfect tint.</review><date>1601395688701</date><rating>5<//rating>< user>

< Review>
The review is a little late but I got my daughter a new car and took it in a couple weeks ago to get all the windows tinted for her. I called, brought it in the same day,  thought it was going to be a few hours and it actually took less than expected! The owner did an awesome job on my daughter’s new Corolla, we’re completely satisfied! Will be bringing my cars here in the future, if I need any of them tinted. The cashier, I believe the owner’s wife, was also very sweet and even had a cute little furry helper with her ☺️ Overall, great experience here!!!<//Review>

Friendly owners, priced equal to competitors, no pressure to choose higher grades of window tinting, but I did as they offer lifetime warranty! My Toyota Prius looks great—exactly what I wanted.< /Review>

They did an awesome job for an awesome price. It’s cheaper than places around here and the standard tint comes with a 5 year warranty!!! There store policy is no refunds but they will fix or redo your service till you are satisfied. So thankful I found this place and loved them doing my first tint. Highly recommend this place to anyone!<//text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I had a fantastic experience with these guys. First, I called around Oceanside looking for a window tint price and appointment on a Saturday.  Each place was either priced higher or only taking walk-in’s on a Saturday.  I just so happen to be next door and saw the Tint shop. The owner was able to squeeze me in same day and complete the job in a reasonable time.

They have three different grades of tint (less expensive to more expensive).  I enjoyed that the owner simply shared the benefits of each grade and let me select with zero pressure.  I would higher recommend if your looking to tint your windows go here!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I Called to schedule a window tint appointment. I told the lady On the phone I had an extra car to also take. She said, she would provide a discount for a additional vehicle. So I went to the site appointment, brought the 2 cars, however, when I arrived, the owner - worker advice me there would no DISCOUNT! I told him politely that I was assured by my  previous call to the site lady on the call would provide a discount for 2 cars. He said no sorry and that he doesn’t do that as he had “many” customers.  He basically did not  care for the business and kept arrogantly stating he had many customers and didn’t care for what the lady in the phone said.

So I left, took my business elsewhere.

So beware and always get a quote in writing. Avoid shady greed.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1601396601160, 'text': 'Like always, here is our side. This gentlemen came in. We did offer him a discount, but SOME discount, not -100 or -150. This gentlemen wanted his other car practically for free. We could not fulfill his request had to send him back. We do see that you went to other shop but was not happy there too. Hope you find a shop that will fulfill your request. Have a good rest of the week. Thank you for the review.'}<//Response>< Rating>

Terrible experience. My windows were redone three times and they looked decent with the last attempt. I waited three additional hours and still felt like I wasn’t satisfied with the job done. The place is lifetime warranty but the worker was not really willing to fix the visible damage on the tint. They left dirt in my window tint and noticed a couple of scratches making me think the film they use is not high quality. I would not recommend.< /text>

Very happy with the tint job done here on my 2016 Chevy tahoe.  I went with their upgraded tint I did 5% on rear and 15 on front. I can easily look out at the sun through the rear Windows without damage to eyes. Great for kids sitting in the back seat for sun abatement. Very reasonably priced and nice owners! Did the job under 3 hours</text>

I got my windshield replaced by these fine people - Called them, spoke to Nan - Other places within San Diego were coming up with  $1200 to $1500 price range because of rain sensors - She explained to me that her that here product already comes with that sensor, got it down to a fraction of what other were charging - Extremely professional, customer service and quality is the best - Today I went in and got my BMW windows tinted, couldn't ask for a better service - Steve was awesome -

Thank you all.< /Text>

Two years later, window tinting remains effective with no peeling or bubbling. Excellent work that stands daily California sunshine in our 2008 Mazda.< /Review>

Not only is their prices reasonable but they also did an AMAZING JOB on my vehicle. I drove all the way from TEMECULA, so It’s worth the trip. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tint shop to everyone who wants to get their window tinted. Thank you Jonathan and the owner for their quality of work.</review>< pics>

<review>Top notch service, great product

I tinted my 2019 Subaru Outback with 5% “Limo” in the back and 35% in the front. The car looks terrific. It is much cooler (both looks and inside temperature).

I had a minor issue with small bubbles on one window and a tiny light gap on another and they fixed it right away.

Family business and with excellent service. Just go here. You won’t be disappointed</review></record>

Went in to get my windows tinted today. I had them remove my old tint yesterday and was surprised by how well it looked. I was originally going to have another company tint my windows because they had cheaper prices. However, the other company is farther away from me and could not get me an appointment until next week. I wanted my windows done today, and I decided since they did so good on removing my tint that I would just pay the extra to have it done closer to home and sooner. I was talking to the guy about what I wanted done to my car when my mom (my ride) came over and heard us talking about prices. She noticed it was more expensive than the other place and said I should just wait. I was going to call the other place and ask them one more time if they could get me in today or otherwise I was just going to go with ShieldX. However, before I could even get on the phone the guy very loudly and rudely says "Whatever, I don't even want to work on your car." Then walks away. Just awful customer service and incredibly rude. Jokes on you dude. You just lost $300. I have a lady coming to my house to do my tint on Monday. She seems very nice, and she actually wants to work on my car. Guess I'll be giving my $300 to her instead of you. 🤷‍♀️

Edit: Just had the professional window tinters come over and tell me that they did a horrible job removing glue off my rear window. I thought it was just dirty, nope it's glue. These people again *want* to work on my car and are going to remove the glue for free.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><text>Great tint shop, took my golf in today, when I looked at my tint job it was great but it was missing the windshield strip I asked for, even after hours the guy did it for me which was really cool. Just one thing is I see a noticeable spot on the passenger window, hopefully it will go away but they have lifetime warranty at their shop so if it still stays there I can get it fixed.

I read all the great reviews for this place which is why I decided to take my car there. I had confidence they would do a great job, and yes the tints did turn out great but when I was given my car back I had multiple scratches above my back tire on the drivers side. My car was brand new, I had it for 5 days, and that was my second time driving my car. When I got to their location I checked my car before I even walked in and I had no scratches. After the woman (the owner) drove my car into their garage we BOTH checked my car for scratches and neither of us saw anything. They finished the tints and once my car was given back to me that is when I saw the very noticeable scratches. I mentioned the scratches to them and they immediately said it was not them. We then watched the video footage, it was hard to tell in the footage what caused the scratches, because it honestly could have been anything, but I am more than 100% sure they were done in their garage. The part that upset me the most was that they kept denying it was them, but how could that be possible if there were absolutely no scratches on my car before they started? The woman is my proof, she saw nothing prior to them starting. After going back and forth they agreed to pay for the damages but I had to take it to a place they chose. As I was getting ready to leave, the man (owner) offered to take me to the car wash next door to see if they could buff out the scratches, I told him I was worried it would cause more damage, but he assured me it wouldn't. They buffed too hard, and it burned some of the color off. I took it the next day to the auto shop which was a Saturday but the man there said the rest of their workers had left for the weekend and to bring it back on Monday, my issue was that I was moving out of State and leaving on Tuesday. I then called the Shield X woman and told her my situation. She has horrible customer service, and that is when she started yelling at me over the phone, not letting me speak, telling me to sue her, and then hung up on me. So because of the timing I could not get my scratches fixed. If you plan on going here, I definitely recommend taking pictures of your car prior to them starting, that way if you are given it back with scratches then you'll have those for proof. They won't own up to their faults. I had a horrible experience here, and will not be returning or ever recommending.< /Text>

<Text>Brought both my cars to them, a Nissan Versa and Subaru Outback.  Was able to make an appointment the next morning when I called. It was so easy and was done is great time. Got some shopping done while they worked. The price was amazing and my cars look perfect. The owners where so nice and I got to cuddle with their pup for a bit. If I ever need a car done again I’m definitely coming back. 5 stars in my book and will recommend them to my family and friends. Thanks again 😁</Text>< name>

I brought my wife's car here for window tint about a month and a half ago. They did an amazing job and the timing was perfect so I decided to bring my car in as well.
I needed a new windshield and wanted my windows tinted. For a Ford Explorer I figured the price would be through the roof but it was not. They were more than reasonable.
I scheduled an appointment for 8 am. They estimated I'd be done by 2pm. I received a call at 11am that they were done, 3 hours sooner than anticipated. Jonathan and the staff there went above and beyond to provide me with amazing service.

I highly recommend them!< /review>

Awesome job! I appreciate the time and care he took with removing my tint and putting new tint on my car. I decided to have Shield X do my tint instead of the BMW dealership and I am very glad I made that decision. Thanks again!< /text>

They were really helpful and I thank Jonathan for his excellent work on all five windows. I would definitely recommend Shield-X for getting your windows tinted. I will definitely be doing more business with them in the near future. Thanks Jonathan, Thanks Shield-X.</Text>< gmapID>

I went to shield x to get my window tint redone because after several years it fades, luckily I went to shield x since the beginning and everything was covered under the lifetime warranty they offer with the window tint... the tint looks great!... definitely a good, fast and friendly place.<//text>

I got my car tinted here months ago and they did such a great job I brought my wife's car over to get tinted. When I dropped of my wife's car they were kind enough to give me a ride back to my house so I didn't have to hang out in the shop while the job was being done. This is a great family business, very friendly people, and I would recommend this business to those looking to receive a quality window tint job!</Review>

Shield-X did an AWESOME job on my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The tint looks beautiful. I went with 5% on all rear windows and 25% on the front windows. I am extremely happy with their service, the price was the most reasonable I have seen, and it took them less than 2hrs to complete. Highly recommend!!<//Text>

<review>These guys did a great job on my 2017 FoST. Front/back windows and tail lights. I was there when the shop opened, they immediately took my car in and quoted me 3-4 hrs. Everyone was so efficient and careful with my new car and had it done in 3 hrs flat!! I left super happy and after everything was cured and clean I have had so many people ask me who did my tint and how great it looks. I have one friend already going to get a new windshield and tint from them.

I will also be going back soon for 50% on the windshield and head lights. Can't wait to get it done.</review><pics>None<//pics><Name>Chris Minster< /Name><gmapID>0x80dc714009e12fc9:0x272280d699f4655a</gmapID>< rating>

I have had both of my Mercedes windows tinted by Shield X and I could not be more pleased.  Their customer service is excellent and extremely fast.  If anyone is even remotely considering getting your windows tinted ONLY take your car to Shield X.  They are truly window tinting experts and will take very good care of your car!<//review>< date>

I came in a few days later and they worked on my car and it looked great. Something weird happened with the front windows but they offered to get it redone free of charge. I recommend going here if you want your car to be taken care of. They're knowledgeable and Steve doesn't mind answering a bunch of questions. 5/5 I'll be coming back once I get a new car.< /review>< pictures>

<text>We are very pleased with the results. We did do some comparison shopping before coming here since I was only familiar with one particular mobile franchise. We were treated courteously and didn't have to wait for mobile service. I appreciate the fact that they fit us in quickly, they did the job right the first time, and the price was VERY reasonable compared to the name brand franchise. There is also a comfortable sitting area with a TV, although we didn't have to wait (since we like to walk around the neighborhood.

Best place to get window tinted. I had my SUV  limo tinted and it looked great.
I am very picky but the lines were perfect and did not found any problems yet. :)< /Review>

<Review>I just got my pick-up truck done at Shield-x.  The aftermarket windshield and front-window tint turned out better than expected.  It was a good experience and good price compared to other quotes from nearby places.  If anything goes wrong they fully assured me with their workmanship guaranty.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dc714009e12fc9:0x272280d699f4655a</gmapID></record>

<Text>Got a good deal here on tint for the front windows of my truck a few years back. Well, over the years the tint faded to the point where it was basically clear. Since it came with a lifetime warranty I took it back to the shop. They replaced it, no problem. Truck is back to looking amazing, they said this tint is from a different company so hopefully it holds up a little better. I bought the cheapest stuff, so I can't really hold my expectations too high. But the customer service and application of the tint is excellent, VERY happy with that part.<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1474954778479, 'text': 'Hey Jonathan thank you for your review and hope you liked your new tint ! :)'}< /Resp>< Time>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>When I called Shield-X to ask if they were offering any Veteran's day discounts on any work they were offering for November 11th, a man responded with a curt "no" followed by an "I'm so busy call later okay?"

I would have been happy to potentially have given them my business, even if they were not offering a discount.  I was merely asking a fair question, and unfortunately, a response of that nature followed by his immediate hang up seemed rude.  I may have to just reconsider the location I will be taking my car to other than Shield-X.

I am giving a 3 out of 5 stars because I do not believe I can honestly evaluate the entire business based off of one phone call, and do not think it would be fair of me to rate them lower, due to their history of seemingly good work they've performed.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Business very professional with polite employees. Made an appointment the day before and they started working on my car as soon as I took it in, didn't take more then an hour. This place also had the LOWEST rates around the area, and even compared to San Marcos. Overall very great experience that I'd recommend.<//review>

Very easy to work with - quick service. I had my BMW 228i tinted recently - and I thought the 20% was too dark. After a couple of days I asked to switch it to 35% and they did that for me free of charge. They didn't need to do that - I would have gladly paid. Very nice people, got my wifes' X 1 tinted as well - both cars look great. I would recommend this company highly.< /review>

<review>My fiancee and I brought our vehicles here to get worked on.

So here goes the review.

If you bring your vehicle to this location, make sure that you go on detail as to what is about to take place with the work they will perform.

They REMOVED the window visors for the VW without our knowledge, permission. According to them it is a normal thing to do (no it isn't). My other vehicle has them and never were they removed.

After they were removed (without our knowledge) they forgot to put them on. It wasn't until we noticed that they remembered them and then tried to slip them on. (It doesn't work just like that since removing them breaks the seal)

Maybe because she is a tiny woman when she began to complain about this, but they decided it was funny and laughed at us because we were upset. Yes, this business believes that it is HILARIOUS that you will get upset because they caused damage to your vehicle.

They tinted the tail lights and it seems the work was done by extreme amateurs. In their site it states 10 years of experience. It sure don't seem like it since currently there are bubbles you can squeeze quarters under.

Make sure you notice the sign that says no refunds. We didn't notice it and now we screwed. Told them to remove it, they didn't want to remove it. I said don't work on my truck after we saw what they did to her car, at first they didn't want to give it back to me because they had just started. Yep, your car may become hostage if you let them (while they laugh at you)

The tint is low quality. There's a nice brownish shade now beaming inside the vehicle thanks to this "top of the line film".

They did pay for the window visors by purchasing through the VW dealer, but not without taking the opportunity to attempt to sway the dealer to use them for their business. Good to see this was part of their customer care program.

Honestly, being told that because the employees are Korean is an excuse for them BLATANTLY laughing at us because they damaged the visors and we were angry about it, to me it shows the caliber of their business. We are SOL on the money that was spent and now have to get it fixed by someone else because I wouldn't trust them with a hard boiled egg after this experience.

Your choice, maybe you'll learn from this.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1474956497490, 'text': 'Hello. Thank you for your time and your review.\n\nAs I reviewed your review and your experience with us, I do apologize again with the satisfaction you had with us.\n\n1. Removing the window sun-guard is necessary for our technician to perform his alteration. Order to make a precise film size with the window glass, sun-guard must be removed. Otherwise, we will not be able to measure the corner and cut them perfectly. Also, to fully install the film to your car, we do need to operate your car up to some point. Sorry we did not gave any notice on removing the sun-guard before hand. However, sun-guards are parts that can be taken out and put it back on. Please note that any part we consider needs to be off permanently, we ALWAYS ask our customer and ask for their permission.\n\n2. Sun-guard that were removed from your vehicle were not placed back on. I am terribly sorry for the inconvenience and your time driving back to us.\n\n3. I am not sure at which point you felt that we were laughing at you because she is a tiny person. We first established in Oceanside since 2002. Moved to current location on 2007 from 3 miles away due to business growth. We would not be here if we ever disrespect our costumer and consider their time and decision "funny". Yet, I do apologize that you felt in such a way doing business with us.\n\n4. I know that after we placed your sun-guard back, it was loose. Because it was our fault not placing the sun-guard on time and unsatisfactory, we replaced your 4 sun-guards at the dealership with brand new. However, refund on the window tint was not done because tint were not defected. We removed your previous window tint and installed with brand new.\n\n5. I am not sure why you mention our tint is low quality. We use "SunTek" film which is considered top of the line. There are comparison chart on their website for customers to review. They come with life time warranty on bubbling, piling off and anything that might have caused during the installation. Suntek does pay for the labor and the part, so customer do NOT have to worry about paying anything extra.\n\n6. If you do see anything from the tint, please come back and we will replace you with new. Our technician had been replacing windows and applying window film since 1981 in South Korea. I can guarantee you this as a owner of Shield-X because he is my father.\n\nOverall I am sorry that you had to walk away with 1 star satisfactory. I\'ve been running this business for more then 10 years and could not have done it without customer care. Please note that you are always welcome here if anything wrong with your tint including taillight. I assure you that no experience you will have again from us.\nagain, thank you for your time and review.'}</Response>

OMG ~ Let me start by saying I'm from LA and  work in Oceanside. I was going back up to have my windows tinted in LA. Josephine at work said NO need to there is a "5 STAR" place in Oceanside called "SHIELD-X" off Oceanside Blvd. I had all my windows tinted and they did an AMAZING job. It was WAY LESS then what I would have pay in LA. I recomend EVERY ONE to save your $$$ and go to Shield-X. 👍< /Review>

<text>Just changed to this friendly dental office.  My first appointment today was a wonderful experience.  Everyone in the office was super professional and pleasant!  Dr. John is a serious professional that does not have an ego that dictates his care/restorative roadmap.  I am moving the rest of my family members to this office.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

We are so happy with the care provided by Willow Glen Family Dentistry! For a nervous dental patient like myself, everything and everyone at this office is as calming and welcoming as possible. The decor is clean, simple, and tasteful. Our favorite hygienist, Sheila, always puts my nerves at ease. Dr. John is exceptionally kind. I am so happy to have found this practice for myself and my young family!<//text>

I visited this clinic for the first time and it was a great experience. All the team members, from the front desk to the nurses and doctors, interacted so cordially with me. My waiting time was less than 10 minutes, basically the time to fill out the papers as new patient. They are clean and explain every step during your examination. Great experience and will strongly recommend this dentist.< /text>

I chose Willow Glen Family Dentistry based on the great reviews I read, and I was not disappointed. They get me in quickly and everyone from the front desk staff to the hygienists to the dentists are friendly and a pleasure to work with. I chose to bring my five year old daughter here as well, and everyone did a wonderful job making her feel welcome at her first dentist appointment.< /text>

<review>My 6 year old daughter came in to have a cavity filled. Dr. John and his assistant walked her through everything, the equipment, what they were doing, everything. Was most anxious about the shot but they made it less scary as well as the whole procedure. She is one who is good about following directions but thought this could be a challenging experience. She did great and we couldn't have been happier with our dentist. They are definitely a "family" dentist!</review>< user_id>

< Review>
Been going here for a few years and really love the friendly staff and excellent service. Dr Forester sold the business to Dr John (my dr) and his wife Leah who both practice here, and have done an excellent job keeping up high quality service! They are a young family and is ready to relate to for us. Dr John stands behind all his work. Reception is excellent as well and we followed Dana to here when she switched offices. My hygienist Sheela is fantastic and very friendly. Don't even know what we'd do without this place ☺️< /Review>

<Review>I just learned that I’ve been a patient since I was 12( I am turning 36 in a couple of months)! Although Dr. Forster retired, Dr. Massoud and the staff have continued to provide the same level of excellent service and care. I especially want to applaud  and thank the dental support team (Nancy, Rosa, Leonor) who have made me feel like family over the years.< /Review>< Date>

Great dental office! I use to fear dentist very much to say the least. I have been going over 12 years to this office. I will even drive from out of town to continue having them be my dentist. You should check them out.</Review>

Willow Glen Family Denistry takes care of all your dental needs in a warm, caring environment. Beginning with the front desk staff to your dental care,  you are made to feel welcomed and at ease. My dental hygienist, Sheila, is wonderfully kind and very gentle but thorough at cleaning my teeth. Dr. John always greets me with a smile and a handshake and his exams are gentle as well. And whenever I’ve needed any specific dental work, the dental assistants, Leanore and Rosa, are great not only at assisting, but at helping me relax during my dental procedure, with their generous smiles and engaging conversation!<//text>

<text>The staff was helpful in providing suggestions and were friendly. There's a nice rooftop patio that they host get togethers with free beverages. The beach is just a step outside with many activities around the hotel. However, the place is dated.< /text><Name>TT L</Name><gmap_id>0x80c2bab7f5330695:0xc4f4421be1bfbf3<//gmap_id></record>

Only stayed one night at this really cool place.  Location could not be any better.  Staff was so super friendly and helpful and the room was perfect.  The only reason there are only 4 stars is because the water pressure in the shower was almost nil.  Everything else was perfect.  Beware the elevator . . . this would require an "E" ticket from Disneyland.  Really a trip and quite entertaining.  If you are thinking of this place, I would book it.  We'll be back!<//text>

Nice rooms. We had a perfect "1 bedroom studio" style room with a full kitchen. They also have larger ocean front suites available. Its a nice hotel that's right on the boardwalk in the heart of Venice Beach!<//text>

This little beachfront marvel is definitely a good choice. It's right at the beach and offers a very nice view from the rooftop terrace as well. Very friendly and helpful staff, great location. Little downsides are the bad parking situation and the cold water in the showers. However we enjoyed the visit very much and highly recommend it.< /review>

Love this historic hotel that is central to everything on Venice Beach! Very clean, great firm queen bed (pull out sofa bed should only be for young kids as it is not very sturdy).  Bathroom is small but tub is big, and has a more modern feel, no mold or dirtiness at all.

Water pressure is awesome, fridge works great and all appliances are awesome for a longer stay.

This is a gem with the amazing views, I would only recommend the ocean view it is well worth the slight up charge!

Staff is great, and u have anything u need just outside the doors.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I love this place. It's absolutely charming,. The studio rooms are spacious enough to be comfortable. Lots of hot water to fill the deep claw bathtub, shower pressure is great, kitchenette has everything you need. Bed was comfy. It's steps from the beach, restaurants, shops, food markets, street vendors and entertainment. The rooftop patio is gorgeous. I cancelled a budget Air B&B 5 blocks away for this spot. Sometimes when you pay 2X as much you get 10X the value. I highly recommend this hotel.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2bab7f5330695:0xc4f4421be1bfbf3< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was very happy staying here. The management is super flexible, and if the room is not booked for the next day, they will give you a late check-out with no extra charge. They helped us with everything we asked for. They have all the stuff you need to go to the beach (chairs, umbrellas, balls, toys), so, don't worry. The room is beautiful and comfortable, although the restroom is a little bit small.< /review>< Pics>

<review>The friendliest, most helpful staff ever, beautiful view right in the middle of the Venice beach vitality. Disclaimer, this is not a modern hotel, it has a few updates, but it's an authentic slice of what rooming was like in the early 1900's. So if that's not your cup of tea, maybe move on.  Enjoy the experience and make sure you ride the elevator-it's amazing!<//review><Resp>None</Resp>< name>

DO NOT stay here. When I arrived with my cousin, the furniture was crooked, the window sills and table objects were dusty, lightbulbs were out, there was food behind my night stand and trash from the last guest. The blinds were broken in one of the windows and the bathtub was also dirty. Dust bunnies in EVERY crevice, literally. Not to mention there was no A/C. The windows were also open when we got here and all the sheets were slightly moist. Also, the sheets had multiple mystery stains on them and had some holes. AND there is no parking, you have to go several blocks to park the car and there isn’t a valet service. They say they lock the doors at night so no one can roam up to your room but the doors are left unlocked and random people just wonder through, and no one is here overnight. The office doesn’t even open until 9am.  Really gross, would not wish it upon anyone. Please do not stay here.<//text>

Stayed here in early April. Incredible location, VERY polite staff. We didn't arrive until 4am due to a flight delay and even then they were very accommodating. The nightlife in Venice is very active and fun! I 100% recommend this hotel to anyone searching for a unique place to stay on the beach!

Side Note: Don't buy the $5 sunglasses at all of the vendors no matter how tempting it is =D< /Review>

<text>Housekeeping was terrible. First night, sheets had sand and large quantities of hair in them. Sheets were unclean and stained, along with some towels. Management was happy to help and accommodating, but fourth night sheets were back to being sandy, not tucked in correctly, and visibly dirty. Was generally a good hotel stay otherwise.< /text>< Pics>

Pros: Great location if you want to be close to the beach

Cons: seemed kind of dirty. The sheets, towels, floors, walls had stains on them which made it really hard to be comfortable. In addditin, the elevator was cool but very dusty.

Was in a little situation where me and my boyfriend were stopped and had to show proof that we were staying in the hotel. I guess it’s good that they are being cautions but wounder if it was the way we looked (African Americans). Besides that the other staff seemed friendly. Wouldn’t come back though.</Review>

I used to bring my two little angels here (Kate and Ivy). They always loved the beach round here and they get their skins tanned from soaking in beach the whole day. Oh! Those were the times, they are going to college now and I hope we will be able to stay here in the coming summer. Thanks for being part of our lives.<//Text>

Stayed there 1 night. I took the ocean view room and I was not disappointed. The view is great, the room is comfy, the personnel is nice, and my son was literally 30 seconds away from the skate park. It's a little expensive but it's worth every penny.< /Review>

<text>Really had a great stay here for our brief stopover with wife and 2 young children. Close enough to the airport, incredibly close to Venice Beach and all its colorful characters and while the rooms are a little rough around the edges, it's an old place and they have obviously worked hard to upgrade it. Very friendly and helpful staff who were very accommodating for our early arrival.</text><Response>None< /Response></record>

<Text>Location is great. Many things are within walking distance. The whole area in general is pretty sketchy (lots of homeless people) but that's not the hotel's fault. Walking to the Santa Monica Pier and the shopping area wasn't bad either. Now, if you have no plans to go to the beach, I'd recommened staying in Santa Monica, not here.

The hotel staff is very friendly.

The biggest con was that we had no warm water for shower, and the water pressure for the shower head was terribly pathetic. And we didn't find this out until the frond desk was closed. At this hotel, I think you are pretty much out of luck if you run into issues outside the business hours.

Unless I plan on spending time at the beach, I don't think I will stay here again.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Yes, the rooms are a little dated but a sparkling new room with all todays gadgets would probably more than double the price.
The area can be somewhat uncomfortable for those not accustomed to the kind of people hanging around, but hey, guess what, it is not suburbia....

But, right at the boardwalk, close enough to public transport if you need it and a lot to see and do on foot.

We had a perfect couple relaxing days at the end of our RV trip through (Mid)Western USA.< /Text><time>1393088307996</time></record></dataset><record>

Nice and perfectly located but old and noisy building, you hear your neighbors.
Room furniture are getting outdated but no big deal. No A/C though.
On the other hand you are just in front of the boardwalk and the hotel has balconies freely accessible just up the boardwalk</review>

If you\'ve been to Venice Beach before, it would be reasonable to think that you would understand what the conditions of the Boardwalk are like and that parking is challenging and can be expensive. We do put information about parking on our website; it\'s under "About our Hotel", "FAQ\'s" and "Directions". It\'s clear.

Awful experience. I would avoid this place at all cost. Drove in from central California to stay one night on our way home to CO. We called the hotel repeatedly for an hour straight while driving in circles in Venice trying to find where to park, with no one answering the phone. Finally got through to someone and was immediately put on hold.  This hotel is in the middle of the delirious circus that is Venice beach, and parking/driving is a literal nightmare. I'm not quite sure how this place expects to run a business without answering 1/100 phone calls. If you aren't going to answer questions via phone then maybe try PUTING INFORMATION ABOUT PARKING ON YOUR WEBSITE.

After finally getting info on where to park, we came back to the hotel to find our bags locked in the office, with a 'will return' sign on the door. We had no room keys, no bags, no change of clothes, and had to wait outside the office until the front desk guy got back from his coffee break. After driving in LA traffic all day the last thing I want to do is drive in circles to park, and then sit and wait to get into a room while front desk guy takes a break.

The beds are horrifically uncomfortable, and the noise is unparalleled. The area around the hotel is filthy and dangerous, requiring an almost constant police presence at night. We could literally hear police radios all night while they searched for a suspect. The drone of radios was frequently punctuated with loud rap music and screaming bums at 3:00 AM. The smell of the trash and alley was overwhelming. This hotel has a BED BUG infestation and I have the bite marks on my side to prove it! Worst night's sleep I have ever had. Having not been to Venice Beach for 10 years I almost forgot how disgusting and putrid LA is, but this experience left me with enough memories to never return.< /text>

<review>Ride the elavator at lease once while you are here!!!

Lovely hotel for a quick stay-cation. The staff was friendly and helpful for places to eat and where to park your car. The view from the tip of the building was amazing and they have a beautiful firepit up there. The rooms are cute (we had one with a queen size and a little kitchenette) and very clean. It's more like a small one room apartment but it's great. There is no AC because it's a historical building so the summers might get warm but we went in cooler months. Only thing I would change is the length of our stay! We should have stayed more than one night!!!<//review>< Pics>

<text>Ok during the day, but at night the Venice Beach Suites are located on a particularly dark section of the beach. The room I was in was a lot more compact vs. the rooms I've had at the Venice Suites or Hotel Erwin. There is a nook for a mini kitchen & fridge, but pretty low quality spring mattresses (ouch my back) and the bathroom is uncomfortably small. Recommend staying at the Venice Suites closer to the Venice Ale House or Hotel Erwin just off the beach instead. Almost identical pricing, same availability and amenities (free wifi etc), but much nicer.<//text>< pictures>

We don't have you listed in our past-guest registry. I manage this family-owned and operated hotel and my name is Matthew as well. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

The manager said the police could do nothing. Hard moving luggage through stairs in the rear. Parking is several blocks away and was given the wrong password. Baby pack and play was stained and came unsetup with no sheets. The loudest doors slams in the hallway I've ever experienced. Wouldn't recommend for parents with strollers.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Excellent location and view from the room: directly on the ocean. On the other hand, the structure is old and unfortunately not well maintained: it needs a more thorough cleaning. The terrace on the top floor is very nice. The staff on the other hand is very friendly. The location in the evening is not pleasant: the area becomes very poorly attended.

(Original)
Ottima la posizione e la vista dalla stanza:direttamente sull'oceano. La struttura in compenso è vecchiotta e purtroppo non ben tenuta:necessita di una pulizia più approfondita. Molto bella la terrazza all'ultimo piano. Il personale in compenso è molto cordiale. La posizione la sera non è  piacevole: la zona diventa molto male frequentata.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>(Translated by Google) Location is great! Cleaning can really be better. And the sofa bed really needs to be replaced because it is completely worn out. That should not be allowed in a room of this price. The staff was extremely nice and helpful.

(Translated by Google) Great location right on Venice Beach, very nice reception with lots of good tips and information, on the ground floor a view of the walls of the house, not exactly quiet due to the location and the car not directly at the hotel.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) We had the impression this is a Stundenhotel
My 13 year old daughter and I have made America tour in 2018, which we booked through the agency "Fair Flight". The Venice Beach Suites was recommended by this agency!
When we wanted to check in the morning, we stood once in front of closed doors, until at some point a completely sleepy, very strongly transpiring unkempt woman came, and introduced us as a receptionist. The door handles were very heavily soiled and sticky, the smell of us was disgusting, the furniture was run down and very heavily filthy, the reception was like a garbage dump, on the corridors crept disoriented strongly intoxicated women who optically oriented to the receptionist.
We were asked to wait in front of the hotel until the receptionist found our booking confirmation, which was certainly not easy in this mess. 
Outside the hotel we saw very old men, arm in arm with vulgar dressed young women go to the hotel without luggage, with clear gestures and intent.
We immediately to throw us without looking into the room, chose another hotel.
I recommend this hotel only with a duration of alcohol in blood of 3% !!

(Original)
Wir hatten den Eindruck das ist ein Stundenhotel
Meine 13 jährige Tochter und ich haben 2018 eine Amerika Rundreise gemacht, die wir über die Agentur "Fairflight" gebucht hatten. Das Venice Beach Suites wurde uns von dieser Agentur empfohlen!
Als wir am Vormittag einchecken wollten, standen wir erst einmal vor verschlossenen Türen, bis dann irgendwann eine völlig verschlafene, sehr stark transpirierende ungepflegte Frau kam, und sich uns als Rezeptionistin vorstellte. Die Türgriffe waren sehr stark verschmutzt und klebrig, der Geruch der uns entgegen kam ekelerregend, das Mobiliar war heruntergekommen und sehr stark verdreckt, die Rezeption glich einer Müllhalde, auf den Gängen schlichen desorientierte stark alkoholisierte Frauen, die sich optisch an der Rezeptionistin orientierten.
Wir wurden gebeten vor dem Hotel zu warten bis die Rezeptionistin unsere Buchungsbestätigung gefunden habe, was in diesem Chaos sicherlich nicht einfach war.
Vor dem Hotel sahen wir sehr alte Männer, Arm in Arm mit ordinär gekleideten jungen Frauen ins Hotel gehen, ohne Gepäck, mit eindeutiger Gestik und Absicht.
Wir haben uns sofort, ohne einen Blick in die Zimmer zu werfen, für ein anderes Hotel entschieden.
Ich empfehle dieses Hotel nur mit einer Daueralkoholpromille von 3 % !!< /Review>

Our records showed you stayed with just the past couple of days, the 15th & 16th of June but your review was posted on June 4th, before you even made your reservation on the 6th. Was this a mistake?\n\nIf this wasn't a mistake, I wish you had shared some comments so that we could better understand your concerns or disappointment in our hotel experience."}</resp>

Jimmy's Pub was a great way to end our round of golf. We had a table overlooking the tenth tee with a view of a beautiful oak tree festooned with lanterns. The food and the service were quite spectacular.</review>

< Review>
Impeccable service!!!!!! Ashley was so friendly and sweet and came and served us on the lawn. She was so lovely and really made our dining experience !

We ordered lavender lemonades - not too sweet, just the way I like it! And shrimp cocktail - the avocado mouse was delightful. But really can't go wrong with any of the pub food bites and complimentary potato chips cooked with truffle oil and Parmesan. Yum.

Perfect place to grab a snack and drink between rounds of golf or after a day at the spa!< /Review>

The beer was great! Atmosphere - HIP Parking can be tricky (metered but free after 6pm) I came here just because of the reviews and I tried to get there early since it was said that the wait can be long (We were seated immediately exactly at 6pm) but it quickly filled up was I glad we got there early. A bit noisy but that was part of the experience. The waiter staff was very attentive. two thumbs up!< /Text>< Pictures>

Great experience here. We sat on the patio and our server was wonderful. This place is within the Ojai Valley Inn and the golf course is right across from the patio and live music is playing under a large Oak tree.< /Review>

This place was so good I'm thrilled to be able to write the first review! Our waiter (Bobak) was friendly, polite and a total professional. The food was unfailingly delicious and the location...on the side of a golf course during a CA summer could not be beat. We LOVED it. highly, highly recommended!<//Text>

One if the Best 19th Hole eateries in Ventura. The Pub Burger n fries are abolutely delicious. This popular cafe is worth the trip. Don't forget to get a Jimmy's cookie. Matilda is a great waitress !< /text>

Absolutely beautiful hike with gorgeous views of the surrounding landscape. I went on a cloudy day and made it almost all the way to the top before walking into a cloud.

The first mile is a steep windy forest trail and the last three miles are on an access road that leads up to the communication towers at the top. The views from the access road are spectacular.<//Text>

<review>Late winter is the best time to do this hike for sure, (February/7/2021).
I was started from Valley hiking up to North Peak, South Peak of Mount Saint Helena.(4,343ft).
My hike was between 10 to 11 miles round trip, and about 2,300 ft of the elevation gain.
No entrance fee, but parking is limited, and a couple of small turnouts on the side of the road.
It has several picnic tables at the trailhead.
My beautiful hike started out with pleasantly through forest.
And just under a mile into the trail, I came across a monument Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial marks.
The trail continues with the Bubble Wall, where rock climbers trying to practice their climbing skills.
Following with graded fire road for the rest of my hike  up to the summit of North Peak.
It is steep but butterflies leading me the way, made its so doable.
The 360 degrees views are spectacular, truly breathtaking.
I was spending sometimes at North Peak to enjoyed my lunch, soaked into the phenomenally views, and capturing a lot of pictures...
The magnificent view keeps getting better and better.
From the top of the summit.
I was able to see Mount shasta 200 miles from the  North, Napa and Sonoma Counties with vineyards and rolling hills from the West, and I can see Mount Diablo  peaking its head up through the clouds. The Sierra Crest, glistening in white, and a thin outline of Mount Lassen.
On the way down, I was explored the Silverado Mine. Highly recommended everyone should check it out!
There are some interesting rocks formations at the Mine.
75 percent of my hike was exposed to the sun. ( bring full liter of water and sunscreen, hat if you can keep it on your head).
Wear good hiking boots for support and for traction.
Finally, don’t wait until summer.
It is worthwhile!< /review></record>

<Review>Difficulty: Moderate (due to distance, but elevation gain- easy)
Mileage: ~10 miles
Pets: No dogs
View: Wine country, ocean on a clear day
What to bring: (In winter) At least 1-2 liters, snacks, hat, jacket, gloves
Parking: Highway 29
Fee: free
Time: ~3-5 hours

We came on 12/28. It was so cold. We started the hike at 7:30, the sun was hidden behind rain clouds and the wind was super strong. We summited in 1 hour and 50 minutes and it was so windy at the top. So bad that we literally summited then descended 1 minute later. Couldn’t even chill at the top. We hit some slight snow. It was sprinkling but it was so cold, slight snow came down. We thought it was pollen until more came down and it made my jacket wet. It didn’t stick much but it was pretty horrible. I thought my fingers were going to fall off. The view was still amazing, sort of gloomy but the sun started to come out once we went down. The first .8 miles is thru the woods, probably the hardest part of the 10 mile hike. The rest was super easy up a big well paved fire road. Didn’t run into anyone going up. We finished in 3 hours with slightly jogging on and off down. Definitely recommend this hike. If I lived in area would probably use it to trail run.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>VERY LONG AND DIFFICULT. Online this is rated as difficult, 9.3 miles long and 2,099' elevation gain from the trail head to the top. But this trail is a nice trail through a forest in the beginning then a fire access/utility/logging road to the top. The trail/road is pretty steep and it's really hard to go uphill the whole way and then downhill all the way back. The last mile was torture! There's nice views though and it can get windy but it's nice and refreshing if you're hot. Make sure if you're starting this trail that you have 4+ hours of day light! You don't want to be stumbling around on the rocks in the dark. You can take the access road all the way back to the main road but it's longer and comes out pretty far south of the trailhead I believe. And bring water! No one should be going up there without water. There's also not that much trash up there either, but I guess that's because a difficult trail keeps out those that litter.</text></record>

< Review>
A great place to hike. The Mt. Saint Helena Summit is about a five mile hike and the first mile is single track trail and the remaining four miles is open fire road. Due to the trail being a 10 mile round trip it will take you 3-4 hours to complete and due to recent fires there is very little to no shade on the hike. Bring water and start early to avoid the heat from Spring to Fall.<//Review>

<text>Did not realize how popular this hike was. I don't think I could do it again though. It is definitely worth it though. We went before 8 AM in case the lot was full, but thankfully it wasn't. We parked in the lot in front of the table rock trail and crossed the street to the Mt. St. Helena Trailhead. I would advise being careful going up through the woods before you get to the road. Even with our hiking shoes, my husband and I slipped a few times and I eventually fell pretty hard.

Take lots of water, Gatorades, snacks. You will definitely need it. I wouldn't skimp on any of those items.<//text><date>1592252189582<//date>< UserId.>

Very nice trail and scenic climb up the mountain. Some recent fires left behind some less beautiful landscape and i hope the trees and Bush's will grow back very soon. This has some historical significance and history to explore and the first part of the trail has lots of shade and isn't as exposed as the fire road that takes you to the summit. Definelty bring lots of water!!!< /text>

<user_name>Kelly Kim<//user_name><Time>1587003423028<//Time><Rate>4<//Rate><text>I would have gave it a 5 star rating but I wish they had a sign for the actual summit because when we arrived at a pitchfork..where there was two different paths to go to was confusing. After about 4.2 miles, we turned left at the pitchfork because we saw a summit but when we arrived at that summit, the worker there said that it wasn’t the actual summit..and pointed out the actual summit so finally hiked up there which was BEAUTIFUL.  The hike was moderate and has lots of rocks so wear good hiking boots.  4.2 mi are on fire road. It is about 10 miles roundtrip. Free Parking off the hwy.</text>< Pictures>

<review>The park is open again.  The entrance is off the highway and not well marked.  I had read reviews online saying to be careful about parking your car here.  I parked on a weekday morning and was changing my shoes in my car, when this beat up car pulled up slowly next to mine.  There were 2 guys in that car and when the saw me, they sped off quickly down the highway.  I assumed that they had planned to break in to my car - so I left and unfortunately never did the hike.  Be careful with your car and hide your belongings in it if you park there.< /review>< gmap_id>

Mt. St. Helena is one of the more diverse and well-maintained trail systems in the Bay Area. It's one of my favorite climbing spots, has a lot of secrets and history. Definitely recommend.< /text>

<Review>BRING SUNSCREEN

For mother's day, I took my mom to hike the trail and when we left our home we were in a thick cold fog bank. Freezing cold, and unsure of what lat ahead, we left our warm weather clothes in the car. About 2 1/2 miles up the trail, if you go on a foggy day, you break above the fog bank. We were we damp from fog, but relieved to be in sudden 90° weather. Hiking in sports bras, we enjoyed the rest our day. The following morning we woke to pain and red skin. If you do this hike don't forget to lather in sunscreen because you won't feel it in the moment, but your skin will!< /Review>< pictures>

I think I found my new threading place. First of all, the place is beautiful. I really liked the digital check in and the woman did my eyebrows beautifully. I like how they let you know if you have a wait time and how long it’ll be if you’re a walk-in.  I was very satisfied with my service.<//Review>

<UserId.>116825037788696697128</UserId.><Text>I went here on Wednesday after having been many times before. I received an eyebrow, upper lip, and eyebrow threading. This time was different because the lady not only left my eyebrows uneven, she also cut my lip and left me with acne all around where my treatment was. I didn’t want to leave a negative review so I contacted the store and spoke to someone there where they sent me to call a different number. When I did so the lady was dismissive and offered a free eyebrow threading. Thank you but no thank you. The damage was already done. I’ve never had acne in my life and she tried to blame it on my hormones instead of her own workers being unclean. This was completely unacceptable to me and even though I’ve been going for 5 years to 4 of their locations. I won’t be returning to any of them ever again. Take my advice and don’t go unless you want them to completely mess up your skin as well.< /Text>< date>

This lady is so rough! My skin was so irritated when I left. I ended up getting ingrown hairs, which I've never had at any other place I've gone to.< /review>

I travel for work and frequent a lot of different threading salons. The experience at this salon was the first time I thought about going back to having my eyebrows arched by a barber. Safe to say I won't be returning. The attitude of the technician made it clear that I was not welcome.<//text>

There's a lady who I didn't even bother remembering her name bc she was pathetically rude. She didn't even give me any customer service and she looked like she was annoyed and almost rolling her eyes before I even got to her. When I went to the back to get waxing, I tried to get up on the table but I was having a bit of a hard time getting up especially since I was 4 1/2 months pregnant. I tried getting on the table and I almost fell off. She laughed at me and didn't even bother asking me if I was ok.

When she was done w me, she didn't even let me get up before she was tearing the paper from the table. She didn't even put lotion or cooling gel where I got waxed and just told me to go to the front. Then after I paid, another person (I guess a regular) came in, her whole attitude changed and she actually smiled and had a whole conversation w her.

The other receptionist was fine but that woman. Yikes.< /text>

<Review>Just got my lashes done and they look like I never got them done. I’m very disappointed and the glue was burning my eyes and the lady that did them kept walking away from me to attend other people. One would think she would focus on one customer at a time. So she can actually concentrate on her job and make sure the customer was happy with the service. Mind you she left me 3 times and all the while the chair I was in was the most uncomfortable chair I’ve been in. The lashes she recommended were medium but the should be called tiny since you can’t even notice I have any lashes on. Never again!<//Review>< Time>

<review>So I wanted my eyebrows tented and I asked for brown. She said yes it was brown. She never smiled, was very short; waving her hand and shaking her head. The tent was black!! I only wanted under my brows cleaned up and she still charged me full price. She did smile when she was over charging me for something I didn’t want $28! So I paid and gave her a tip but I will never go again! When I asked about the tent she made up some excuse. It didn’t matter because the damage was done! Never again!!</review>< Pictures>

I went a few weeks ago before my baby shower to get my eyebrows done.  She did a really good job, fast, and I like that they are open until 8pm...<//Review>

Worst eyebrow experience I have ever had! I went to get my eyebrows waxed and the lady didn’t test the temperature of the wax before applying it which led to me getting burned. Also she didn’t even bother tweezing out the hairs that got left behind when I asked politely. My eyebrows look worse especially with the burns, I will not be coming back.<//review>

Ridiculously loud promotion. I was in the shopping center and they had some music on that was obnoxiously loud. Couldn't even talk on the phone in my car with the windows rolled up. I approached them and politely ask them to please turn it down and they laughed at me. I have no problem with trying to promote more business but what they were doing was noise pollution. And they were rude and uncaring</text>

BEWARE!!! Never coming back to this place again. I grew out my eye brows because i wasnt satifistied with the shape. I told the lady to please clean them up and do my natural shape. And she didnt listen. Told her thats not what i wanted and at the end she went higher and thinner on my left brow. I cant even fix it. She tried to blame my eyebrow. Said it was already missing hair. No i told her it was fully grown. They werent even close to being the same shape. I hate this place. If i could give a negative star i would.</Review>

This place sucks really bad. That lady messed my eyebrows up they look so bad I have to wear a head band on my eyebrows so they don't show. I recommend you to never ever go this salon. They don't know how to do eyebrows.< /review>

Half ass job on our eyebrow threading!
My kids and I felt like we were a bother to them. I think they would rather just sit and watch the rain drops.

First time coming here. My husband and I finished work early today and wanted to get massages. I called in advance for a couples full body massage. When we arrived, they took us in right away! The massage itself was amazing!! Even better than some fancy hotel spas I’ve been to. I feel so relaxed even after my massage. We also did hot stones which was a first for me, but very nice. I am thinking of bringing my staff here one day as a nice treat for them. I will definitely be coming back here again, even if it’s just me this time.<//Text>

<review>$70 for 90 minutes with hot stones. I have membership at massage envy and they were booked for a last minute massage, so I tried this place and was pleasantly surprised. I'm a 241lb body builder had shoulder and neck tightness and the therapist here worked them out.<//review>< Pictures>

Time to update my review for Serenity.

Given the great prices, I decided to come back
4 more times since my last review.

While I will maintain that the type of massage (both the pattern and style) continue to be varied rather than cohesive to just "Thai" - the quality has gotten a lot better and more consistent.

Each of the last 4 massages could be described as - Good / Good / Great / and Excellent! The last massage was done by Lucy (forgive me if I got that incorrect).

She was fantastic overall - and made 90minutes feel too short because the massage was so great.

I still struggle with 2 things: turnover - I never know who will be there when I go. And the beds. The beds are comfortable enough but the hole where you place tour head is too rigid and too small - so either your sinus above your brow or your jaw takes a lot of the weight and becomes unbearable over time.

Fix this last issue and 5*s can be yours! Ill be back. Thankfully!< /Review>

I come here every few weeks. They are all great and my muscles feel so good after. Definitely a very positive, relaxing experience. All very nice and professional. The price is such good deals. Less expensive than any other spa I’ve been to and they are the best. It’s my zen place.< /text>

This place has really improved overall. The prices are very reasonable. We did a couples massage for $80 for 60 minutes. The ladies Lele and Dena did an amazing job. They focused on the areas that my husband and I asked for and used the perfect amount of pressure. The rooms are very quiet and created a calm peaceful atmosphere.  When your done they bring a small cup of water and were very polite. It was very easy to call in an book an appointment. We will definitely be coming back.<//Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Worst spa experience ever! The towels laid out were dingy looking and damp! The massage therapist had no clue what she was doing and I had to cut short my 90 mins session to an hour after I couldn't take it anymore. In the middle of the session she started wierdly wiping me down with a cloth that was initially warm, but continued long after the damp cloth was now cold. About an hour after the appointment I started (and I'm still) itching uncontrollably! Go get a massage here at your own risk!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Private rooms.  Fair prices.  Most the staff don't speak much English but if you know what to expect, not an issue.  Best to call for an appointment as you can be turned away if you try to walk in for a massage.  Solid reflexology massage.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dcb58b59f63041:0x585a5f9ee9761dbe< /gmapID><Rate>4<//Rate>< resp>

I would've gave this place 5 stars if they knew what we were saying.. went in with my bf telling them were we needed massaged out and they just nodded and said yes.. our fault we didn't walk out. Felt like they would've been great if they knew what "too hard" ment I said it 4 times even moved her hand once. Oh well.. won't be going back sorry. Also didn't seem sanitary 😷<//Review>

<Review>Its a great price!  Its not a fancy high end custom hotel massage, but it will do the trick to get rid of your stress. I recommend it. Be open minded try something new.  You might like it.  But don't complain when it doesn't compare to the spa at the Ritz...it's $20! 😉<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< date>

Cindy, aka Le Yan, is the most amazing masseuse I've come across at this location. She covers all the aching areas and literally puts me to sleep sometimes.
That's how relaxing her message is.
Thank you Le Yan
See you soon...<//Text>

Today was my first visit and I am with the therapist Jenny doing a 60 minutes Swedish body massage and 30 minutes foot C3. She put exactly the right pressure on spots of my foot, shoulders and head. Jenny is very attentive to my needs and comfort. Come out with my relax like a new person. I'll be back regularly asking for Jenny.
Plus, it is a very clean and quiet place with graceful music. Thanks, Serenity, you made a good job.< /text>

My second auto purchase in 4 years, value and quality is important to me and I found it here at Enterprise. I generally only rent from Enterprise so when I needed a vehicle I looked everywhere and what I found was value for my hard earned money at Enterprise Car Sales.

I recommend Enterprise Car Sales to everyone who talks of a car purchase. I got a Hybrid with less than 4,000 miles, just what I was looking for. What a bargain. Thank You again Enterprise.<//Review>

Everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable! Extremely helpful is an understatement! They go above and beyond, especially Nick! I felt safe inside the building as they had Covid precautionary measures in place for the customers and employees.

Thank you Marcelo and Management.
I truly feel that Enterprise Car Sales Staff @Reseda put the needs of their customers 1st, 2nd, and 3rd priority.
The wonderful staff are fully of real people professionals providing in high fashion a great service for real people.
Enterprise has the HUMAN TOUCH that is needed in business today!
You must experience these unique professionals.
They have raised the Bar!
Thank you again Enterprise!</Review>

This is the worst place I've ever been for a car sale or business in general in my life.  Stay away.  They sold me a car running my  credit 5 times, putting my deposit getting the insurance,  signing contract,  and then telling me the car was not available. They excuse inexperienced worker. Then tried to sell me another car.  I'm getting legal advise. Don't do business.  They gave misinformation and lying about fixing the problem through runaround in New years eve when I'm attending a sick person causing harm to me and the sick one.  BAD BUSINESS .<//review>

<Text>I purchased a 2019Jeep Compass from Enterprise last month and I love it.  Marcelo helped me and he is the best car salesman ever!  Not only did he drive to another city about 50 miles away from his work location in Reseda to pick up the car I chose online, but he also sent pics and video.  Such an incredibly kind gesture!  Reina drove the car to me and I live about 100 miles from the Reseda location.  We set a time and she was there as expected.

Very Pleasant, Professional and awesome to me that is.  Everyone was very concerned in matching me with a car of my choice.   Which was fast and easy, all started by asking one person and the chain reaction began.
Thank you, Rebecca<//text>

The deal went well....I drove down there and traded my car in and drove away with a new used car...the vehicle works well and has had no problems. The people at Enterprise treated me well and the transaction was easy.</text>

<Text>I was told it will take a shorth time to purchase a vehicle, however six hours later I was still waiting for the system to complete the sales transaction, the sales manager was not help at all. The sales person look new and not well train at all. I left the place with out buying the car but two hours later the facility manager called me and asked me to return when I got there the total financing price was not the same as the original price before I left. In short the employees need to have adequate training and hold themselves accountable for their mistakes.</Text><user_id>114191750648816556352< /user_id><response>{'time': 1601559078166, 'text': "Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Gabriel Navarrete.

sold me a car within in two weeks I needed completely new breaks. once they sale you a car they try to dodge you and never return calls.i have to go up to the establishment five different times just to talk to them about defects and mistakes they made. I have several issues with my car since I bought it and every month there is something else wrong with it. this location is negligent and will not help you once you leave the lot. horrible customer service from the bottom up (besides the manager Luis). Everytime I have waited in line not a single employee has greeted me (with exception to a maintenance guy once) they just walk right past me, never once looked me in the eyes, and one associate even ran into me and didnt acknowledge me.do not purchase a car from this location please.< /Text>

< review>
I would have given 5 stars if it wasn’t for the sales rep, Cody Kleemann, at the Reseda location. I bought a 2019 GMC Acadia from him.  Before I actually bought it, he promised to fill up the gas tank, but didn’t. When I asked him about it he said it was a “miscommunication” and they never fill up gas tanks.

I then asked him, in lieu, to help me out with getting me a great rate for a rental car and he said “for sure”.

But again, when it came down to it he back pedaled.

I told him that’s not how you treat clients. Just be upfront about things.  No need to lie just to give the appearance that you’re helping when I’m fact you’re just a liar that’s trying to make a sale.  I have all the text messages to prove the above.< /review>

<review>This is the second car that I have purchased from Enterprise Car Sales.  They have terrific customer service.  They work very hard to find the perfect car for your needs. If not on their lot, they will search the other sites to find and bring to you the perfect car.  I feel very confident with the car service that they put every car thru before selling it.  And every car that we looked at was below Blue Book value. Jack & Akin  were great to work with! very helpful.<//review>< Pics>

We have bought from Enterprise on Reseda Blvd in the past., so it was a no brainer that we would do it again. I recently purchased a Subaru and I’m loving it! The Sales Team is beyond awesome, are super caring and really go the extra mile to truly make the experience a great one. -  Tevis you are unbelievably awesome!
If you are thinking about purchasing a vehicle do it through them! I highly recommend.</text>

<text>I went to Enterprise and test drove a vehicle I really like but wanted one year newer. So I test drove the one I wanted the year I wanted another place and found out that it had been an Enterprise Car Rental, so I called my trustworthy Enterprise Agent Tevis and got the Car Fax and info on that car. What I found was that all of the cars I was looking at were in fact Enterprise cars so again I called Tevis and found out about all of them advertised and it just wasn't good news. So I asked Tevis what she had of that year, and she sent me an email link that had 6 cars that could all be transfered to the Reseda location. She didn't know it but one was the color I was looking for and really wanted. So I called her and she made the call to make sure it was still available, and the next day she asked if I could be there to see it. Not only was I there to see it, I bought it and drove it home that day. She was great. and put up with me wanting to look around, and even helped me look and check out cars at other lots by sending me car fax etc. She really earned my business and I was happy to give her my business. I had the best experience and outcome, and I absolutely love my car.< /text>< Date>

This is the 2nd Enterprise Car Sales office that I've purchased from, and honestly this is the friendliest and most patient group of agents I've ever met. I drove 1 ½ hours to their lot in order to see some cars. It took me quite a while to decide which vehicle to buy, and I never felt pressured or rushed in any way. I'd travel the long distance to work with them again.

The sales lot is not large because it shares space with an Enterprise rental agency; however, like any Enterprise sales office, they can have vehicles brought in from other locations if the vehicle you want isn't on their lot.< /Review>

ENTERPRISE CAR SALES - 5 STARS!

I want to bring to your attention the OUTSTANDING service I received yesterday. February 11, 2020.
I feel Enterprise Car Sales, should know, if they already don’t. how really great the sales team is in Reseda. California. I use the word team, because that is what they were.
Mr. Jory Rucker was the sales representative that helped me. He was friendly, well informed and a pleasure to deal with. He listened and heard what I wanted and found me a great vehicle, a 2018 Ford Focus hatchback. He made me a great offer, which I accepted. The managers and all the other employees were all friendly and all introduced themselves to me. They were like a family.
They made a very long day a lot more bearable.
Thank you Enterprise Car Sales. My very best to you all.

I just purchased a new (used lease car) Toyota Corolla from Enterprise Car sales in Reseda and was very happy with my purchase. My salesman found exactly what I wanted, was very patient with all the paperwork, and was very helpful. The payments were a little higher than I expected, but everyone worked together to try and give me a great buying experience overall. I would recommend them to others-- Happy with my new car...</Review>

This was literally the best experience purchasing a car I have ever had. Everyone in the office was polite and helpful. They really felt like a team. Everything I wanted on my checklist I got. They were so knowledgeable and answered every question I had. I will definitely recommend my family and friends to purchase their car through  Enterprise Car Sales.<//Text>

< Review>
This team is awesome. They got me the exact car I wanted at a fair price, took care of any of the expected used car purchase concerns I had, and really delivered a stellar experience. I was skeptical of purchasing a car through a rental company, but when they explained the process/quality/certification to me, I was sold. I did research online first, told them what I wanted, and they made it happen.

Two procedural things you should know: 1) If you transfer a car in from another location, there may be a fee, and you will be responsible for paying it upfront. For me, it wasn't a big deal, but plan it into your overall budget when looking. 2) If you have any questions pop up after the purchase, no matter how small, they will take very good care of you, so just ask.

Cody, Rayna, Jason, and the whole team there are rock stars! I highly recommend including Enterprise as an option for purchasing a used car.

Thanks, guys!<//Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>The process was easy and the team was great at the reseda branch. I had to have my car transferred from another branch and I was updated regularly on the status which was nice. Everyone who helped me was very kind. The only problem I had was with the website. I did my research online before going in and selected the car I wanted based on the features. But the features listed online aren’t accurate or verified in anyway. For example my car said it was keyless entry and heated seats and it has neither. And looking at the same exact car some at other branches said push to start, but apparently this model doesn’t have push to start. The website should be more accurate, it just doesn’t make sense. What is the point of listing the features online if it’s just made up? Just don’t list any of the features if you don’t know what they are, that way customers won’t be disappointed when they realize the car doesn’t have these things after they’ve already purchased the vehicle. It just isn’t right.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Diego and Rayna from the Reseda Enterprise Car sales were amazing! This was my first big car purchase and with my old car dying out of the blue, I wasn't sure I would be able to get a new one from a dealer. I set up a test drive appointment thinking I would just look at options of cars and payments. Since my old car needed a new motor I never thought they would trade it, let alone give me above what the car was worth, site unseen. But they did! And towed it away from my house at my connivence! Diego listen to my needs for a new car and showed me the perfect option! Rayna helped me secure the best loan rates she could. A few hours later I was driving away in a 2018 AWD Nissan Rouge! I'm absolutely loving this crossover SUV. Took it camping this past weekend and was amazed at how it handled the road. I felt safe and stylish. Thanks to Diego and Rayna for making buying a car such an easy, hassle free experience! You guys are amazing. Between their stellar customer service to their exceptional quality of vehicles, I highly recommend buying your next car from enterprise!<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< username>

<Text>I worked with Jack and he made finding the right car easy and correct. There were two things that I didn't like. One was that I picked out a Blue color  originally. I was given the vin number and everything to get the  car insurance. When I went back two days later to give the money and pick up my car, it was bought by someone else in another town.  I didn't think that was right since I was given vin number and everything.  It felt like bait and switch. The one I picked after that was fewer miles but was more money.  I should have been offered a discount given that my original was not really secured for me.
This isn't Jack's fault but one of company policy, I believe.
The company could still rectify it...
The second thing is I wasn't really taught my car.  I still don't know where the spare tire is and I had to go to Best Buy for them to teach me how to set the radio, etc.<//Text>< time>

Upon renting a car from Enterprise after totalling my previous car in an accident, a representative from Enterprise mentioned to me that there was a specific Enterprise location that sold their own used vehicles.  After being informed of this, I went to that location the next day and spent little time deciding from numerous choices.  Typically when buying a used car, a person often can’t be as picky about certain things like color, and other factory upgrades.  With Enterprise, its almost as if you are buying a “brand new” used car because they have such a beig selection to search from.  I was able to walk out with better than I anticipated before getting into what would be a “new car” for me.

Thanks Enterprise!<//review>

I really appreciated this style of buying a car. It was no pressure, tailored to my needs, fast, and easy. The staff was courteous and helpful in answering my questions. They processed my rental car and I was off in my new car that same evening just a few hours later. I am very pleased with my new car and the whole process. Thank you, Akin and Rayna.</text>

We had recently were in need of a car and after a lot of research we new Enterprise would probably be the best option. We scheduled an appointment and took some cars out on a test drive. Dyanna was the associate who was helping us and she made everything make sense,and we did not feel pressured one bit. We could not decided on a particular vehicle so we went home empty handed. After a lot of deliberation we went back and finally decided on a vehicle. Dyanna was amazing she came to the store on her day off to make sure we were been taken care off. If it was not for her and her amazing customer service our experience would of been different. She is amazing and we our in love with our new vehicle.<//text>

< review>
I had NO IDEA Enterprise did car sales!!! I have nothing but good things to say about this place. The sales person who helped me was Dyanna, and she was very helpful. She walked me and my cohorts through the different options we had based on our price range and wow, we were able to get a 2017 Hyundai Accent off the lot for a little over 12K, taxes included! The paperwork was very easy to finish, and once done, Dyanna insisted I take a picture with my new car, which had a big green enterprise bow on it. Of course I chose a goofy pose. If I could give higher than 5 stars to this place, I would. Great job, ladies and gentlemen.< /review>

Amazing customer service! Employees smiling from the moment you come inside the office. I reserved a car on their website but they said would be too small for me and my friends so they gave us an upgrade in order to accommodate us better. Thank you guys for the amazing rental experience. Fast, accurate and clean!<//text>

I was very pleased with the experience. From pick-up to drop off I felt like a valued customer.
Sergio was very pleasant and made the sign in and car pick-up very easy.
I would definitely use Enterprise again.</Review>

< Review>
Very long wait for everything!! Previously I bought 3 vehicles & the process was quite a bit smoother. The problem as I was told was there were not enough people doing the right job. Apparently the manager is the only one who can do the appraisal for my trade in & she was busy acting as a salesperson. The gentleman who assisted us Akin was very nice, but would disappear for periods of time. He did a very poor job of reviewing the checklist on how to operate the vehicle. It was late & I think he was in a rush to go home.< /Review>

Wish all used car sales were this honest and helpful  and offered a ton of great purchase options. Purchased 5 cars from Enterprise over the years and always got great running cars. They all were mechanically perfect with no engine, trans, electrical, or maintenance issues. Never had to use the warranties (they offer 24 and 36 extended warranties at great prices in addition to the 12 month/12,000 mile included with purchase price) that came with them and simply took them in for standard service work. The "no hassle" price feature is great and I always had a wide selection of makes, models and features to choose from. Purchased these from Ventura, Reseda, and Culver City locations. Highly recommended if you want a  "like new"  vehicle that has been professionally maintained and has all the service records for documentation. Enterprise staff were always friendly, helpful, and great to work with.<//text>

She even got the car from the yard and drove it to the Enterprise sales lot.  My husband also bought his vehicle here at Enterprise 2 years ago, same superior experience!!!< /Text>

I've gone to Enterprise Car Sales for my purchasing needs twice already, one in 1998 in the Gardena location and one here in the Reseda location.  It is definitely a no haggle place, and that is what I like about it and why I decided to return in 2016 for my new car. If you want hassle free buying just tell them what you want and that is it! Highly recommend coming here instead of the large dealerships with all the pressure to buy.</text>

It definitely beats the 6-8 hours you wait in a big car dealership. Their vehicles are priced decently and very well maintained. The financing part was a fast and clear process. I definitely recommend Enterprise if you are looking for a a fairly new, fair priced vehicle.</Review><UserId.>103783938157741432702<//UserId.>< pics>

< Review>
Richie Garcia recently joined Enterprise Car Sales in Reseda as we found out. Nevertheless, he showed a true,  professional demeanor of an honest car sales representative. He knew key features of the vehicles we looked at. This was 3 days after my near fatal accident by a hit and run left me injured and somewhat depressed. Yet, Richie's positiBe attitude gave us the hope we needed to find the right car within our tight budget. I would highly recommend Richie to my family, friends and anyone looking for a used vehicle.</Review>

Josh and Rayna were both able to help me purchase a car when no other place could. I am very happy that I can now drive anywhere I want to. Thank you both and the Enterprise team at Reseda for all your help!</Text>

Diego Bermudez was excellent! He was very patient, we just drove approximately 6 different cars. He knew the specifics about the features of each one and went into detail about them for me. The buying process was worry free and I was delighted that there was no pressure causing it to be a relaxing experience. I started texting my nephew and son for advice about their thoughts about each of the cars and Diego was willing to wait for me to feel comfortable with my decision on the one I did decide to buy. Reina the finance manager was also very nice as well.< /text>

<text>The Enterprise Team was wonderful- especially Malcom and Jason- who guided me through a rapid and comprehensive process, answering all my questions thoroughly, giving reassurance patiently and enabling me to buy my precious Kia Soul- my first 'new' car in 26 years!

Bought a Focus from the Reseda Car sales lot. Great people working there. They got financing and insurance for us. Nestor and his crew were great, gased the vehicle and washed it in the dark before delivery.

Great People...Great experience! My own credit union, where I have had accounts for over 30 years could not respond to our questions or turn loan information around as quickly as Enterprise did. Special thanks to Tevis, Jason and Nestor. If you buy from Enterprise you will never go to a car dealership again.<//Review>

Yes, the cars being sold are "used," but their sole owner - prior to sale - was Enterprise Rent-a-Car, which diligently maintains its fleet of rental cars.  Only the best 10% of its rental fleet are ultimately offered for sale.  Tevis Schwee, my sales consultant, is knowledgable, thorough, and kind.  I now have a car again, and I am enjoying it thoroughly.< /review>

We had a really good experience at Enterprise.  Tevis confirmed the appointment, showed me several cars, which I test drove three of them.  She offered me a beverage as well as my family.  Enterprise got me a better rate on the loan than I had obtained through my credit union.  I never felt pressured or hurried in any way.  The only downside to the process was the length of time it took to get everything squared away, and that could have been partially due to my problematic credit report.  The process took 5 hours, which seemed like a long time.  We had a three hour drive back to Santa Maria, but did enjoy getting dinner at Acapulco in Northridge.  I just recommended Enterprise to someone walking in to work this morning when she complimented me on my car.  I will certainly be a return customer.<//Review>

I've purchased two cars from this dealer before.  Both times with Tevis as the front person.  She's awesome, even if she does call soda 'pop'.

As car buying goes it couldn't really be any simpler or less pressure.  Find the car you want on their website and they will have it waiting at the lot that's nearest to you, or if you don't like the one that they have they'll go and get the one you want.  In my case, the car I wanted looked black on the web page but was dark brown at the lot.  It was exactly what I wanted other than the color, but they never even tried to convince me or my wife to accept it (eg: hey we'll knock X dollars off, or other tactics I've seen elsewhere),  insisting that we should be happy with our selection.

The prices are good compared to anywhere else and the test drive is, not kidding here: Seven days long.  It's a full week long test drive with a no bones policy about bringing the car back at any time for an exchange or just if you change your mind.  The final price for the car is completely explained, and I didn't see any padding type expenses like 'paperwork preparation' or 'detailing fees' or anything like that which I have seen at other locations.  They have options you can select like extended warranties, lojack installation etc that you're welcome to chose or skip, and it's in a take out menu format so you can pick and chose what you prefer rather than selecting from a 'good better best' type list.

As I said the prices and vehicle quality are comparable to elsewhere, so the real reason for choosing this place over another is in the details of the purchasing experience.  On the whole I feel like this is pretty much what the car buying experience should look and feel like.</review>

<Text>My experience with Enterprise Car Sales in Reseda was awesome.  What made it so awesome, is that you can view, test drive, and get CarFax 's on different makes and models all in one place.  If the car you want is not on the lot, go to Enterprise's WebSite and search their inventory.  Make a list of the cars and send to your Salesperson.  They will go and pick up the cars and contact you immediately so you can test drive them.  When you purchase a car at Enterprise Car Sales they give you a week to make up your mind.  During that week if for some reason you are dissatisfied you can return it to Enterprise Car Sales and you can pick another car.

Buying a car is stressful enough! The staff at Enterprise were very informative, patient and considerate.  I told my girlfriend about Enterprise Car Sales and how smooth my purchase went and she purchased a car from them the next week.

Thank you Enterprise Car Sales.

< Review>
I purchased a 2014 Jetta SEL from Enterprise Car Sales in Reseda, California on 11/21/17. On 11/22/17, I noticed a rattling noise in the rear speaker(s). I immediately contact my Enterprise Car Sales Rep, Dayne Lowe and he asked me to bring in the car so he could check it out. I drove right over. He admitted to hearing the rattle but needed to consult with his boss Juaquin. A few days passed before someone else called me named Reyna. She provides me with a name and number of an audio store in Anaheim (I live in the San Fernando Valley). I call her back and tell her I’m not driving to Anaheim and the person I spoke to said their store in the San Fernando Valley is only doing upholstery at the moment. Speakers still rattling. By this time I decided to put everything in writing. I emailed Dayne (my car salesman) and cc’d Joaquin & Reyna (his “bosses”). Through those email correspondence, it was stated that my car would be taken to a Volkswagen dealer to have the speakers inspected and fixed. I then requested documentation of what services were done to my car. I was then asked to bring my car in so they can take it in. I did and picked up a rental. They had my car for 3 days. I called and spoke to Reyna and she said my car had been fixed and was ready to be picked up. I headed over right away. Once I picked it up I drove literally around the corner and noticed the problem wasn’t fixed, the rear speakers were still rattling and there was a handwritten post-it in the cubby under the radio that said Nick, ICC, (address on Vanowen St.) and the words “back alley.” So, this is where they took my car. Some “back alley” audio place that just turned my base down to -1 instead of on 3 where I had it. I turn right around and go back to Enterprise in Reseda. I go inside and get another Salesman by the name of Akeen. I explain the situation to him and he agrees to get in my car and listen to the rattling noise. He too admitted to hearing it. Again, Enterprise wanted me to leave my car with them and take another rental. By this point I was fed up and refused. I told him that I’d take it to Volkswagen myself and send them the bill. That never happened due to family matters and work. On 12/26/16, I receive a text from Dayne (my original salesman) following up to see if I’d gotten the speaker looked at/fixed. I told him that I hadn’t due to family matters and work. He stated that he passed the information on to his General Manager, Jason. I asked Dayne to have Jason call me. He did and basically he told me that as of 12/12/17, Enterprise is no longer allowed to drive customers cars to get them fixed. I explained that, that was quite convenient since this issue dates back to 11/22/17. He then tried to say that I can take my car in to get it fixed and again, I refused. I told him this wasn’t fair to me to now have to deal with this when the issue was never fixed in the first place. He said they took my car to “Nick” their audio guy and he didn’t hear the rattle. I said then he must be def because both Dayne and Akeen heard the rattle. So, after putting $4k down on this car and giving them more than one chance to resolve the issue, still isn’t fixed. I would not suggest anyone purchase a car from them. They are liars and don’t do what they say they are going do. The worst customer service from such a reputable company.< /Review>

These guys are Beyond Great! I can't say enough good things about them. My girlfriend bought 2013 Toyota Prius with such a good experience, that I was in for the exact same car within 4 days! Tammy took care of her car. Tevis (sweetheart) took care of mine. And Nester, well he's the quiet super sharp finance guy who really wants to get you a great deal. They all do! They're all great. They take their time, they're very efficient and they make it a nice painless process. This is NOT at all like buying a car from a certified dealer or lousy used car lot. Buying a pre-owned car from this place is just downright SMART. Fully certified and inspected, added warranties on 17000 parts, added road side assistance with rent a car, GAP insurance, better prices than a dealer. You buy a car from them your SET. Just make sure you get a good name brand car your happy with Toyota, Nissan, etc and no worries. I don't usually write reviews. I'm not getting paid for this. I am a real person. If your looking for a new/used dependable car with thousands taken off the sticker price with added benefits and an friendly awesome team of people to get you there - These guys are IT! Would recommend a friend no problem.<//review>

For the first time, I actually had a really good experience buying a car. Malcolm and Tevis at Enterprise Sales in Reseda had their own checklist to find out what I want and do not want in a car.  Malcolm then took me on various test drives, and really listened to my concerns.  He suggested I try a car I'd never been interested in (a VW) simply because he himself drives one and loves it, and it seemed to him to fit my criteria.  Malcolm was calm and low-key, but attentive.  I never felt pressured (I hate being pressured).  I tried the VW Jetta and surprised myself by loving it.  I ended up buying it.  It's been about 3 weeks, and I can say I truly enjoy driving again.  This car is fun!   Anyway, I big thank-you to Malcolm and the folks at the Enterprise Sales in Reseda.  This is the first time I've had a good experience buying a car, and didn't leave feeling drained and exhausted.</review>

<user_id>110821948490217114671</user_id><text>I went to Enterprise to just look to see what they had to offer. I was greeted warmly and treated nicely  (by Akin) as I looked at their cars.
On the lot they had the 3 different models of cars I was interested in buying.  I test drove all 3 of the different models.  It was a very short test drive.  Literally around the block.  I was able to decide that I wanted  to buy a Nissan Versa Note.
Enterprise has a no haggle policy which I liked.  I knew upfront what the car was going to cost and nothing surprising was going to occur.
The bad news I bought the car on a busy day and it took at least 4 hours to buy the car.  I believe their finance managers position was vacant.  It truly was a disappointment to be sitting there for so long.  I believe that it should have taken a lot less time to buy the car.
Other than the delays the actual buying of the car was easy.  Everything was clearly explained to me.
Everyone was kind and courteous to me especial Tevis Rybin.  She had the job of connecting the blue tooth in my car.  I am far from savvy in that area.  She was very patient and good at what she does.
Two weeks later my blue tooth in the car was acting up.  I went back to Enterprise for assistance.  The women  who greeted me, I don't remember her name had no clue about helping me.  She went back to her manager and was told by the manager to tell me to go to the dealership to have it fixed.  I was quite unhappy about that  response as I knew there was someone on the lot that could fix it.  They all seemed to be in the managers office "busy".  I was able to find Tevis on the lot and she immediately helped me.  The blue tooth had to be reset which took her a few minutes to do.  I really appreciated her time as I thought it ludicrous to go to the dealership for my problem.  The opinion I drew from this experience is you buy a car from them and then  if you have a small issue they absolve themselves and push you to the dealership.  I did not appreciate that attitude.  Especially since I knew there were people on the lot who could've helped me.</text><gmapID>0x80c2997904248729:0x4db694ecc8c20fff<//gmapID><Time>1473886375497< /Time>< resp>

< review>
In April 2011 we purchased a 1 year old 2010 Hyundai Elantra from Enterprise. The purchase experience was sub-par, but I attribute that to the inexperience of the associate helping us. The price was reasonable and on par with what our research showed for a 1 year old car in excellent condition with 30K miles and a clean carfax report.

Unfortunately, as we found out in 2015 when we went to trade it in, instead of the approximately $7000 it should have been worth, it was only worth $3500. The carfax report showed it had been in a serious accident in March 2011. Enterprise, as the owner of this former rental car, knew full well that it had been in an accident and doubtless intentionally dumped it on us at full price knowing that carfax would not have been updated yet to show the accident. They essentially scammed us out of $3500. This is not just a problem with the Reseda location, but rather with the ethics of Enterprise Used Car Sales as a whole, because the car was transferred from a lot in Arizona.

I advise staying away from Enterprise. They are no better than any other shady used car seller.<//review>

<userid>107931665380131422328</userid><Review>Halibut taco appetizer amazing 👏 bread super good raspberry ice tea great now the not so great. Both the wife's main dish and mine were not that great,she had the fettuccine and spinach and I had the tequila chicken with shrimp both were quite bland leaving much to be desired. Cesar salad 🥗 was great I loved the dressing!

Atmosphere: great outdoor seating. I am quite disappointed because I saw some good reviews and all of the pictures online looked amazing<//Review>< Pictures>

The food was great, but it took 15 minutes to get a drink and another 30 to get the check handled. For one of the more expensive places I've been i felt like dennys had better service than this.<//Text>

<review>Fast and friendly service for it being Valentine's day and being busy. The food was actually much better tonight then when we had dinner here with friends right before the second shutdown.

<Review>Great food. The marsala was fantastic. Only problem was I ordered to go, told it would be done in 30 minutes, got there on time, and waiting an hour for my food. There was only 4 people ahead of me, but many of the 15 people behind me were very upset.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
My first time there, not impressed one bit. The prices were fine, the quantity was okay, but the ingredients were lacking. I had the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp and it's made either from a flower or cornstarch gravy, seriously lacking cheese... not to mention the lack of heavy cream and butter. That's no way to make Alfredo sauce. The shrimp, while somewhat adequate in size and quantity, were boiled, not sautéed in butter and garlic. They were most likely purchased frozen and already boiled. And the meal didn't come with any sides - no side salad, no bread, nothing. Just a plate of noodles, shrimp, and gravy - that wasn't very good. And the noodles were overdone. I think the cooks need to understand the term Al dente. The wateress wasn't much better. She didn't offer a side salad, and we sat there for over 20 minutes waiting for her to come over and ask if we wanted dessert, which we did. And no grated cheese was offered.< /Review>

<Name>Michael Doyle<//Name><review>Fugazzis Restaurant is a corner property on the main drag in Visalia. It is an upbeat, slightly upscale, establishment where Audrey and I chose to spend about 90 minutes to enjoy a nice, full meal.  We split a Mediterranean salad, an encrusted salmon fillet and a side of coconut prawns.  She finally settled upon a Ruffino Prosecco (fruit-forward sparkling white wine) while I enjoyed a Corona Extra (on tap) with lime.  Two bread varieties were tabled at the outset with an oil, white balsamic and red pepper dipping sauce.  The wait staff were relaxed, pleasant and professional.  The table setting, location and style were well suited for a trendy, Italian bistro.  The food was fresh, texture and temperature appropriate in every course.  The  presentation was above average, the flavors subtle, yet challenging.   We paid $50.55 + our generous gratuity for a dining experience well done.</review>< time>

I love this place. Great location downtown Visalia is like stepping into main st USA. Small and local, makes you feel like being with old friends. The food is great and the staff is friendly. Love the atmosphere. Since they started opening places everywhere the food and the service has suffered. Not a new story, seen this many times before< /review>

The blackened chicken is really good! I would say this is a “safe” place to eat, your going to get consistently good food but maybe not anything absolutely amazing. They offer bread while you wait and have a really good Brussel Sprout appetizer available as well. As with any restaurant service is all about the waiter / waitress you get and how busy it is at that time.</review>

< Review>
Honeslty the friendly service was slow due to the lack of workers. But without nickpicking, the food and drinks were perfect.
It was my birthday and the cheesecake was totally not expected and made me happy that this place was open.
Kinda magical eating in a parking lot... XD<//Review>

Superior holiday atmosphere, prompt, courteous help staff.  Our waitress forgot the salad, which would have been an excellent Apple and Pecan toss but, the Pear and Walnut salad would have been equally yummy.  There is a broad range of well seasoned, beef and shrimp, pasta based dishes.  No sausage choices.  Sauces are properly seasoned, not too salty(!) The seating is a little uncomfortable for me but my woman likes it just fine.  Great beef appetizers and beef stroganoff.  Yummy dry portabello ravioli with mushroom cream sauce on the side.   Great wine list and full adult beverage selection as well as full bar.  Average desert menu but, the selections are site-prepared, fresh and outstanding.   We go there just for the warm berry cobbler, coffee with Bailey's and primo vanilla bean ice cream!<//Text><username>Michael Doyle<//username><Time>1575226642757</Time></record></dataset><record>

Great food here, the calm chowder was definitely a little bit on the extremely salty side.(Almost like someone added triple the correct t amount)  I would think that a higher end restaurant would have a cook who is taste testing and making sure his ingredients are on point. Which usually they are. Every thing else was good just watch the salt.<//Text>

I'm not terribly inspired by the menu, but it was quite bit better than "just average". It was pretty noisy, as well, needing to speak at a very high level, just to be heard by the other half of a table for eight. But, it's pretty good. I'll go again, in the future.<//Text>< name>

<review>Sat at the bar.  The bartender knew the person I was with.  They exchanged greetings.  I was never acknowledged...well he (without making eye contact) asked if I would be eating or just a drink.  Had one drink and left.  Hopefully next time I will be greeted.  (So that means I will go back)  I hear the food is excellent.< /review></record>

Went there for my birthday on a Thursday,  we sat in the lounge area for 20 minutes asking every waitress and bartender for a waitress to attend us. Finally got our waitress and she was great, the food was good. BECAUSE OF THAT EXPERIENCE I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN.< /Text>

<text>Restaurant was quite busy. Ran the waiter around a bit too much. Not enough staff, food was spectacular, drinks were delicious.  They were also told by State Guvna, Newsom to close down this day which probably effected the low staff issues. If open inside dining, due to Covid be patient. Worth it!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Great service and waitress. However, how is it still acceptable to tell women to settle down in 2019??????

We were told by a male employee ( manager?) to settle down when inquiring as to why we didn’t have the correct amount of seats for a reservation we had made( weeks in advance). We were not raising our voices or yelling. We also agreed to sit at a separate table away from the rest of the party when the seating arrangement could not be made in a timely manner.

Come on women deserve more respect than that. Don’t talk down to us. Do better fugazzi’s.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Fugazzis restaurant is a good place to have a creative really good meal. It’s a little more upscale but you can totally dress casual and feel comfortable. Menu features fresh ingredients, trendy but good food. Portions are generous so you won’t leave hungry like some trendy chic places. They have a full bar and the wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly. A decent wine selection. A good place to celebrate an occasion or just have a weekday dinner.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

For a quick, good lunch try Fugazzis at the Car Wash Cypress and Akers.  Not the ambiance of their restaurants but the same good food.</review>

Went in around 2 for late lunch and a cocktail.. waited 8- 10 minutes to even get acknowledged. Not many people there . Gal at the bar on the phone , at least 8 people standing by door waiting. Offered us a table with stools. We said we'd rather have a table. At least 20 open , clean tables in other room but they wanted us to wait while they cleaned a table. We decided to go to Sequoia brewing across the street. Service was 5 star, homemade root beer and crown Royal cocktail and a hot butter rum something... delicious. Turkey sandwich and Philly cheese steak both tasty<//text>

Our waitress forgot the salad, which would have been an excellent Apple and Pecan toss but, the Pear and Walnut salad would have been equally yummy.  There is a broad range of well seasoned, beef and shrimp, pasta based dishes.  No sausage choices.  Sauces are properly seasoned, not too salty(!) The seating is a little uncomfortable for me but my woman likes it just fine.  Great beef appetizers and beef stroganoff.  Yummy dry portabello ravioli with mushroom cream sauce on the side.   Great wine list and full adult beverage selection as well as full bar.  Average desert menu but, the selections are site-prepared, fresh and outstanding.   We go there just for the warm berry cobbler, coffee with Bailey's and primo vanilla bean ice cream!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGfi8I4i9R9vpTS-okm7xotuCPZ66w7OqYXACV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
A popular place with a good rating normally means good chances for a good dinner. This time we were a bit disappointed. The place is pretty noisy and it is difficult to keep a conversation going across the table. Service was ok but not super good, we had to wait quite a long time for the food (probably because we had ordered pizzas). It tasted good. A minus for the lack of real Vegan options, in practice it was taking cheese off from the pizzas. No specific Vegan dishes.</Review>

Gone downhill in the past year.  Food was fair.  Tails left on the shrimp in my pasta so had to use my hands.  Service was fair.  Too many tables in our waiter's section.  Loud restaurant - hard to have a relaxed conversation<//review>

It is a great place to eat. Good food and the pizzas are awesome. Love the bread and dipping sauce. Only downside is the noise level. It is hard to hear yourself think but at least your conversations are private. The chocolate puddle cake is absolutely amazing! Not a cake fan but I didn't even know I was eating cake because it was so moist and drenched is chocolate sauce.< /Text>

Horrible service. We were sat in the back by the kitchen when there were plenty of other tables available. Our pasta was not even separated. Our waitress didnt even offer us water. She did the bare minimal. Our adult drinks were nasty. I will never go back. $60 for 2 meals could of been spent somewhere we felt welcomed. To say we felt racially profiled puts it lightly.</Review>

The food was a little slow to come out, but not too bad, still managed to dine within my lunch hour.  I ordered a Spicy Shrimp pasta plate, which had AMAZING flavor to the sauce, but I must have missed the spice somewhere, also I only got 3 shrimp!!! =/  my wife's pasta could have used a little salt because it was a bit bland, but overall a very good dining experience and good tasting food.< /text>< Pics>

They did get busy and slow, but the whole place was packed by 7 on a Thursday night. If you have never been, then this will surely become one of your favorite places to eat. I haven't found anything on the menu that I did not like, I have been told that I am a picky eater.

They have amazing food their bread they bring to the table is amazing with the oil you dip them in. The truffle fries are great with their aioli especially the jalapeno one. The sangria is amazing it is very refreshing and fruity.</Text>

The red quinoa and kale salad is super good. My date loved his philly sandwich. The poor point is that it's a little pricey and they should do unlimited bread in the beginning (not just my opinion but many others who've been). The waitress was sweet and helpful and patient.<//Text>

<Review>Super awesome hip new age place to dine. Has one of the coolest chill areas at the bar with sofas...it is like a bar met a niche coffee house atmosphere and creates a great place to gather with friends.

<review>Fugazzi's impressed me the first time. I ordered some Shrimp new Orleans type of dish and it was very good. I also had a lemon drop martini that was also pretty good. I was excited to go back again and the second time, I noticed they actually changed the dish. It was not even close to the same experience. I felt bummed and haven't been back since.

Pasta is really good, recommend the Al Pesto Tortellini.  They have this bread and oil for you to enjoy as you wait.
On Tuesday they have really delicious tacos you can order in the blue room.</review>

<Review>Excellent food. When I was there, the only downfall was the profanity at the bar that I was close to and it was extremely hot, which is why I was near the bar by the door. Loved the brussel sprout appetizer and the angel hair pasta with shrimp. The bread and sauce is excellent as well.<//Review><gmapID>0x80952f6455a675df:0x322c0e2cad8a7838<//gmapID><Rating>4<//Rating>< Pics>

I like the bar and the ambiance but the food is always just ok, nothing has ever impressed me. Portions and on the small the medium size. Bar and ambiance is fabulous though so still a good place to go and they have lunch specials just not my cup of tea.</review>

<text>I'VE EATEN HERE TWICE. THE FOOD IS PRETTY GOOD, BUT VERY EXPENSIVE. I'M A "NEW YORKER," SO IT'S HARD TO PLEASE MY PALATE. I'VE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH THE MENUE, ONLY THE PRICE TAG THAT COMES WITH IT. *THE PIZZA ISN'T THAT GREAT.</text>< Gmap_id>

A prime downtown restuarant that everyone in town knows. Went on a normal Friday evening (Jan 25th)and it was pretty busy. It took me 19mins to get a second drink after asking twice.  The waitress was very nice but not the most put together.  The pricing is alittle more than average restaurant but not by much. You can expect to pay $50 for dinner and a drink. I recommend it just be patient when its busy you may wait a while for your food.<//text>

Great food, lovely atmosphere.  Ordered the spinach dip.  Interesting twist, it's spinach dip meets blackened chicken bruscheta.  It's very good.  👊😀<//text>

I wish I could give Fugazzis management 0 stars. They were extremely difficult to work with for an event that we hosted at their restaurant. I called ahead of time to discuss table arrangements and the day of the event we showed up and literally nothing was done how we had decided. They do not offer linens for their ugly silver tables and when I asked them to send me the number of the tables so I could arrange to bring my own, Gabe, the GM told me “just to guess” because he didn’t have time for that. Also, their food was average at best.  That being said, their waitresses were helpful the day of and I do appreciate their hard work. Due to the lack of respectful management, I would absolutely NEVER recommend hosting an event at Fugazzis and I will not be returning. This was an overall very difficult experience.< /text>

<Text>My favorite place in Downtown Visalia. You always get treated like royalty. Very upscale setting, and amazing ambiance to sit down and have a drink! All staff go far beyond to make you feel welcome and satisfied! The owner Mike and the Manager Gabriel are always super friendly. They always greet you with a smile and make you feel welcome.

My wife and I love this place. This is our favorite local spot in Visalia. Catch it in the evening, and plan to have great drinks, great food, and great service!
Great portions, reasonably priced for a fancy restaurant.
Be sure you dress to impress, because people that go here dress up for the occasion.

Ambiance is great for adults and families, but make sure your kids are well behaved. This is NOT Chuck E. Cheese environment.

This place is a "must stop in" for people visiting looking for a local spot.
The food there is to die for! I've even had the pleasure of eating their food at a wedding, just extraordinary taste!
You have to try the "Al Pesto Tortellini"<//Text>< Response>

Little bit of a late review....

Was invited for a midday drink with my buddy who owns his own shop across the way. Had a new Spiked Apple Cider Beer and it was quite refreshing with a crisp and robust taste. Forget what its called, but I would seriously have it again.

Upon the recommendation of both the bartender who happened to b the manager on duty and my lunch mate we had some fried brussel sprouts for a appetizer. Keep in my mind I have never had them because well growing up as a kid you learn to hate them lol. But these were amazing!

I've been here a few times in my life here growing up and they never seem to disappoint. I will be back again real soon.</Text>

<Review>Worst meal I have ever had. I had the fried halibut fish tacos and the fish was so tough and tasted like it's been under a lamp for hours. I used to get these tacos a long time ago! The quality of food has gone downhill. They use frozen spinach now for example. Just overall downhill and a waste of money.<//Review><Response>None</Response><Rate>1</Rate>< date>

seemed like a great place. they get 1 star for ambience great feel to it. 1 star for presentation it looked good they lost a star for making us wait for almost an hour to get our food. we were done choosing out food and waited for a while for a waiter to take our order, then it took a long time to get the food.

they lost a star for how well it was cooked. i ordered steak medium and what i got was well done and charred. it also said it had mushrooms on it... i literally saw a small sliver of a mushroom.. thats right 1 sliver.

they lost a star on taste, i would give this a half star, and i felt three stars was too good for my experience. the dressing on the salad was good, the flavor of the bbq sauce they put on the meat was good, and the mash potatos were dry, but tasted good. for the price to portion ratio seemed high on the price side, $15 plus tax and tip for maybe 4 oz of steak, salat, a carrot and a small scoop of mashed potatoes... and the meat was burned...

final thought. im not done with this place id try it again. as i understand resturaunts have off days.< /Review><rate>2</rate></record>

This is my second time at Fugazzis, first time at this location.... and can I first say, I've not been disappointed at all, at either location.  The salad is fresh, crisp, as if it were just picked from the garden, the bread and bread fusion sauce is soooo good... the halibut tacos (appetizer ) , for the love- of-tacos, YUM! The magerrita pizza, to die for... the atmosphere,  LOVE IT, modern, relaxing,  light music, not loud at all... I will be back!< /review>

Wait time was an hour and 45 minutes. I realize the staff was super busy, but the host was not welcoming at all. We went down the street to another busy restaurant and were greeted by the most welcoming, pleasant host. It's all about the service.</text>

<text>The service was terrible.  We were seated in the back with a large loud group next to us. And we waited and waited and waited. We finally walked out after 20 minutes.  We walked down the street for a fabulous dinner at Little Italy Restaurant.  Skip this place and go to an authentc Italian restaurant.</text>< Pics>

Chicken Marsella was on the dry side. Lacked much flavor. Spagetti lacked flavor too. Vegetables were best part of the meal. Service was good. This was first time. Could have been off night.< /Review>

Lively atmosphere with modern eclectic decor. Good food choices and a nice bar with a sofa based lounge area that is comfortable for waiting or just to meet for drinks and talk.</Text>

Have gone to this place each time my friend from Georgia comes to visit. The food is good and the decor is nice. have not been here at night so it could get better. Have not had drinks but by the looks of the place i say a drink would be a good idea at night.</Review>

Their meals are creative and insanely delicious. I'm never disappointed. I once had the pleasure of attending a navy ball where fugazzis catered, a few days later they just so happened to cater at my friends wedding. The food was so wonderful that I went into the restaurant with my family for a third fugazzis experience in one week. I mean, $20 for a chicken Chipotle penne pasta dinner and a classy cocktail. You really can't beat that price for the overall quality.  Keep it up :)< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80952f6455a675df:0x322c0e2cad8a7838</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Small town lounge and restaurant with few servers, bad desserts and worse cocktails, looking like it was built in the 80's and never renovated. 🤤<//text>

Alot of money for a tiny tostada but it was authentic enough with mexican cheese.  The Chicken was pretty tasty, and even had white meat.  It had a sprinkling of lettuce and it was 95 cents more for a tiny dollap of Guacamole.  The Chips were burnt tasting....can you pleeeeze change the oil?  Burnt oil is toxic and bad to fry things in, I think it is best used for Bio-diesel.
Doubt i will go back...to many other places to try!< /text>

<text>-1 The service was terrible, the food was cold, the beer was hot from sitting on the bar waiting for the server to actually bring it while they were all grouped in the back just talking to one another, my husband's steak was half right and half burnt, the steak on my salad looked fake and microwaved, we will never go back!<//text><UserId.>101604994377383867559<//UserId.>< Pics>

<text>Gorgeous food display with deliciousness to follow. Kinda loud for a date, or family meal; but overall the atmosphere was great. The waiter didn't check on us much and offend more then not we would have to wave him down. Other then that this place was great and I will be going back again<//text><GmapID>0x80952f6455a675df:0x322c0e2cad8a7838</GmapID></record>
