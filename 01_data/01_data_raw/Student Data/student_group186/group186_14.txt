Dr. Kassardjian was a joy. She was extremely hospitable, capable and efficient; everything you could possibly ask in a skin care physician. She did a great job in preparing the patient by fully explaining the procedure and ensuring the patient does not have any unanswered questions. Most importantly, she displayed skill and efficiency throughout the process. Highly recommended.<//Text>

Dr. Klein and his staff are the best in the business!  From start to finish, the entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable, professional and they answered all my questions.  I was a little nervous about my surgery, but Dr. Klein took the time to patiently walk me through the procedure and calmed my nerves. Dr. Klein’s surgical skills are unmatched! My surgery was flawless, I had no pain and my recovery was smooth. If you want the best, schedule an appointment with HK Dermatology!< /Review>

Love, love my experience with HK Dermatology. I felt safe as they follow CDC guidelines. I feel very confident to refer Dr. Norma Kassardian for expertise. She is genunine and personable. She takes her time to listen to your needs and you don't feel rushed.  I do not feel pressure to have anyone try and upsale anymore services or products . Everyone is knowledgeable and friendly. More importantly again it was a safe place. 5 STAR PLUS!< /Text>

My appointment went very smoothly. I only waited a couple minutes, and first saw Elena Novak, PA-C, who did my skin exam. She was personable, bright and communicative. She gets 5 stars! Then Dr. Klein came in and looked over the places she had identified (two keratoses on my head). Dr. Klein examined the toe he had identified with fungus last year, and for which he gave me two liquids to apply twice daily. Dr. K said it looked as though my toenail was now fungus free. Following this, Elena very capably froze the keratoses, being very sensitive to any pain I might have been experiencing (there was only a light sting during her injection of lidocaine. Over all, this was a superb visit, especially during this COVID time, which usually has doctors swamped. The office staff was also efficient and friendly. I'll be back in a year.</text>

<Text>Love HK dermatology. It had been while since my last visit and the staff is just as friendly as I had remembered. Dr. Norma was fantastic. She really walked me through concerns and questions that I had, I never felt rushed or unheard. Covid protocols are too notch as well! Thank you for making a visit to the doctors office during these crazy times as pain free as possible!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>The wait is a big problem.  Learned to schedule myself first in the day.< /text><Resp>{'time': 1614120941801, 'text': 'Hi Kelley,\nI apologize that there is often a wait when visiting our dermatologists. You have found the best solution - it is very helpful to schedule your appointment early morning (or right after lunch as the practitioners often use the lunch break to catch up after a busy morning). We pride ourselves on being very available to our patients with urgent skin care needs. Since our practitioners are booked out for several weeks, we find that we sometimes end up overly busy if we must squeeze in a patient with an urgent skin condition, or if a patient comes in with a complicated skin condition that takes a great deal of time to diagnose or treat. We appreciate that you are a loyal patient and are happy to offer you those early morning appointments that help you get in and out quickly.\nSincerely,\nMichele Horwich, RN\nPractice Manager'}< /Resp><Pictures>None</Pictures>< time>

I was wondering since i had been waiting in the cold courtyard so long, if i had been forgotten since you kept admitting people before me.  Maybe you should set up a video - next patient will be  - in your patio.  Or come out and like in the old days use a chalk board.  I dont know it was kind of unsettling, especially since my cell ATT ws not getting reception in your area and i had to ask another patient to call in for me.  I cant recall when i have ever been anywhere for 10 years or more when i did not get reception. Even left your reception courtyard and went out into the parking lot.  Still no reception.   Long letter.... but thank you Dr. Klein for your services.< /review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>My daughter and I have been patients of dr. Klein since the mid 1990s. After so long I'm convinced he's one of the very best dermatologists in the nation. As a chronic skin cancer patient he's treated a variety of maladies for me, always well and competently. Just this week the treatment meant a 2.1 inch incision in my cheek and when I studied it afterwards, the sutures looked liked the finest BH plastic surgeon; there'll virtually no scar. He is also a very nice person who radiates both experience and competence, and his office and clinical staff are the same. In closing I'll mention that I'm a Kaiser patient but I continue to go to Dr.Klein and pay cash myself because of my confidence in his skills.< /Review>< Response>

<text>First I found most impressive the manner in which the front office answered the phone by the 2nd ring. They were very pleasant in assisting me with a new patient appointment which was quick and effortless.

When I arrived at the office for the first time, I was happy to have been helped by very courteous front office staff.  Next my appointment with Dr Norma was very comprehensive and informative.  She was very attentive to my questions and did not rush me at all.  She had a very kind disposition.  I felt she genuinely wanted to wanted to help determine the best course of action for my condition.   Dr Norma is everything you would want in a doctor.  She is smart, compassionate and kind with an awesome assistant and front office to boot!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I've been seeing Dr. Norma for many years now.  I have fair skin, and like all teenagers from my teen days I didn't use sunscreen like I should have.  She's super diligent in my annual skin checks and doesn't do any unnecessary biopsy's.  She's great at handling some of the sun damage BEFORE it gets too bad.  I'm really happy with all the services and peace of mind Dr. Norma offers me.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>Dr. Norma is very caring and patient.  There are very few doctors that have the kind of bedside manner and knowledge that she has.   I highly recommend choosing Dr. Norma as your Dermatologist.  The staff at the office is also very kind and helpful.  It is a great office.</Review>< pictures>

Dr. Kassardjian is not only a fantastic doctor, she is also a fantastic person. I really look forward to getting to chat with her during my sessions and although I know I must be taking up her valuable time she never makes me feel like it. Not only is she professional but she will be truly honest with her advice. I think HK Dermatology foster a feeling of community that makes the visit a pleasure.<//Text>

I was seen within minutes of arriving.  Dr Klein spent quality time with me.  He performed a biopsy & burnt off some brown spots & rough patches on my face and body.  There is no other dermatologist I would want to see.  He’s the best‼️‼️< /Review>

<review>Have seen the dermatologist and nurse practitioners here for over 25 years. Have had multiple medical and cosmetic procedures. They are amazing. Kind. Gentle. Conservative. Skilled.

< Review>
Nurse Michelle, who injected the numbing medication prior the procedure, was soooo gentle I didn't feel anything.  She was so soft and calm spoken. it practically calmed me down.
Dr. Klein, is my Angel.  So gentle, didn't hurt me one bit throughout the entire procedure which was a bit lengthy.  After a couple of hours he came with a smile 'all clear' - it made me feel so relieve.
Amy also took care of my wound very gently.
Great office staff.<//Review>

<review>Having found cancer under my eye, I had to have surgery to remove the issue (Which was not fun). Dr. Klein is VERY GOOD at what he does. He explained everything throughout the process and made sure I was comfortable. His office is very clean, and his staff attentive. I can't say enough about him. Very glad I found him, he has earned his 5 star reviews. Thank you Doc.< /review>< Resp>

I drove from Temecula (over the Ortega they are at the end of the Ortega essentially) and was in on time and treated with utter love and respect. It’s a real Doctor’s office; not a factory. They are  that much “more better!”  Love them! Been a patient client since approx 2002<//Text>

Dr. Norma is always so warm and gracious, but her charm doesn't stop there.  She remembers her patients and is genuinely interested in them.  I was in for a routine skin check, but her demeanor isn't dependent on whether the visit is an expensive personal pay or a billed-to-medicare one.  She gives her full attention and care no matter the reason for the exam.< /Text>

< Review>
I give these 5 stars because of Attousa! She's the best and the only one that seems competent. Squeezes me in any time i need a cyst injection. However the office staff, while friendly, is always a challenge. Booking the wrong dates, taking forever to refund (4 phone calls to accomplish this). This is just the recent stuff. For years, the office staff is just a nightmare. i only return because of Attousa< /Review>

<Text>UPDATE: 12/2020 I’ve been coming to Dr Klein’s office for years, but this is the first time I’ve had Dr Klein taking care of me, along with PA Elena. They were both fabulous. Elena is very kind and she prep’d me for some work that Dr Klein was going to do. What a gem she is. And Dr Klein himself, what a nice guy, very personable, and super quick, and really went the extra mile for me. Didn’t hurt at all. Thank you to everyone at Dr Klein’s office!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Dr Norma is the best. She is a kind and caring doctor and she pays attention to detail. Thank you Dr Norma!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Am visiting from Ohio and saw a TV segment on the Pie Hole in Pasadena. I told my son, who lives here, I wanted him to take me there, but then found out they had just opened a location here in Santa Monica inside Gelson’s. We arrived at that location a little before closing and selected a few items to take home to try. We told the cashier our story and found she was actually the Operations Manager. She rang us up and gave us several other goodies to take home to try! We were blown away by her generosity and then blown away by the product! Everything we tried was delicious! I promise you can’t go wrong no matter which uniquely hand-crafted sweet you buy!< /Text>< Name>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>Delivery service was terrible from here. Ordered at 6:45, initial eta for 7:31.  Then 8:06. Delivered cold to the touch at 8:30.

We ordered a few options for dinner and nibbles. Overall experience felt like having someone bring you something from the grocery store carry out case rather than an actual pie bakery.

Portions were tiny for the price with the entree pies the same size as the side order of mac & cheese.

Shepard’s pie was ok if you like mushrooms.
Vegan curry was Trader Joe’s quality.
Pepperoni bites were bland & unsatisfying.
All 4 sweet pie bites had ok flavor but were a little bit like having a stuffed shortbread cookie as compared to a pie pocket
Earl Grey slice was light & balanced. Aside from the trouble crust it was pretty decent.
Mac & cheese was better than expected as a side.
Overall food quality was below pricing but okay if you weren’t expecting a bakery experience. Again felt very much like someone going to Trader Joe’s carry out section quality wise but smaller portion sizes then you’d expect.

——[reply to Pie Hole 4/26/21 ]———
Reached out to DD delivery team and they referred me to you all for help with resolution of this bad experience since with ChowNow the restaurant directly charges the customer. Ultimately this feels like bad customer service on top of an overall bad experience. The fact that your response to me emphasized the low review score over making an effort to address my experience or make things right is disappointing. I chose your restaurant to try to support a local business that was new to us as a family and used ChowNow to try to have more of my check go to the establishment versus the more mainstream food apps (GrubHub, DoorDash, etc.) but your response leaves me reading the other reviews and feeling like I should have gone back to Winston’s Pies since they still use the higher end flaky pie crust and ingredients that we like and feel are more in line with what we pay.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1619389904921, 'text': 'Hi Kevin, thank you for the valuable feedback. We wish we had more control over the DooDash delivery times but unfortunately that was not the case here. It seems like you actually enjoyed most of what you ordered (thanks again for all the feedback) so it seems really harsh to give one star review. We work extremely hard baking fresh daily and ensuring the orders are correct and would really appreciate it if you would re-evaluate your review .'}< /response>< GmapID>

I was so disappointed when the Pie Hole location closed on Lincoln and Rose, so imagine how thrilled I was when I found this new location inside Gelson's only a few block away! If you aren't familiar with Pie Hole, do yourself a favor and try one of their tasty offerings, best pie in Los Angeles in my opinion.<//Review>

We visited The Pie Hole in Venice after a morning class and treated ourselves to a delicious Chicken Cornbread savory pie as well as the Cereal Killer and Brownie sweet pies and were not disappointed.  The space itself was modern and comfortable and the staff were fantastic!  I highly recommend this place for takeout and dine in options and pies are seriously some of the best in the city.</Text>

While this place has a fantastic vibe and cool place to hang out/study/work. I was expecting delicious pies and people highly recommended the Earl grey tea pie and while it was good and easy to tell it was made of high quality ingredients, the taste fell a little short. Staff was amazing and friendly.</text>

Came here to try their pies, with high expectations for the Earl Gray pie, since it was recommended on a YouTube video. Left disappointed. Way too sweet. Not creamy and fluffy enough.
I guess I am spoiled by the cream pie from  StoneMill Match in SF.<//Text>

<review>The pies are amazing! The guys working behind the register were personable and nice to talk to. I went with my fiancee; she got the Earl Grey pie and loved it. I went with my favorite kind of pie, Key Lime, and they did not disappoint! Music was also fun, some hits from Bruno Mars. 10/10, highly recommend, and I'm definitely going back to try other flavors!!< /review>< Pictures>

You like Pie?
I do. I came here and met up with a friend. Great pie. thats it. lol.
Great service too. We sat and sampled a few of their pies. Really nice place to hang out for a bit of dessert.
There were some sketchy people hanging out outside, kinda passed out so we just ate inside.  Fun times.
Really Legit Pie.
Parking was pretty simple</Text>

Came in to taste the tart cherry pie while it's still in season. It didn't disappoint. It was slightly tart and sweet at the same time. It was very delicious, however, I also had the blueberry cobbler and I think that's my current favorite. Pie was slightly sweeter than the tart cherry, but not overly sweet. Pie slices were served chilled and on small aluminum pie plates. There were a few people in the establishment when we got there. About 3-4 tables with customers. The savory pies caught my attention. I hope to taste them on another occasion.</review>

<text>Cute store but the hot pies aren’t very good, especially not for the price, and with no included sides etc. Not sure about the sweet pies but they looked overpriced for the slice you get too. Better off going to the Aussie Pie Shop in Santa Monica for a good hot pie worth the price.< /text><resp>None</resp>< name>

It's good, but it's not mind-blowing good. Especially for how expensive these pies run (a whole apple pie came out to be just above $41) I don't feel that it fully met my expectations. This location is brand new and the people were friendly enough.< /Text>

The cashier was very very sweet and was welcoming. It was my first visit and I asked her for her recommendations for fruity pie she said shes liked the pumpkin or the the custard. I told her to surprise me, I ended up having the custard which was ammmmaziing! Super sweet filling and flakey crust yumm!!

<text>(Translated by Google) Earl Gray is delicious. It's crazy with cream and pork ... enjoy it twice or three times.
I paid $ 42 for the hall size for reference.

(Original)
얼그레이 넘넘 맛있어요. 크림이랑 파이랑 찰떡이에요... 두번 세번 드세요.
참고로 홀사이즈로 42불 줬어요~< /text>< time>

<Text>Charged through the pandemic.

A lot of people were charged and completely screwed over by these people. I highly suggest finding anothepeople to go to.

If you absolutely need somewhere to go, go here, the facility is very clean and the temp is perfect. There's a lot of room here too which makes it wildly unfortunate that they do business like this< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<review>This facility is getting overcrowded day by day and hard to do proper workout as most machines always occupied and very hard to follow a workout regimen. I used to love going here but since they decided to close the Calloway location, most folks switched to this new facility and hence getting overcrowded.</review>< username>

<text>Warning! We requested membership cancellation at the onset of the pandemic (March 2, 2020). Cancellation was processed by Jason. Apparently it did not go through effectively. We haven't thought twice about Body Xchange since-- until yesterday when we received a letter from a collections agency in the amount of $189 for this account. They are stating that we never cancelled, and are now being reported to collections for non-payment from April-November. This is the first we have heard of any attempt to bill or collect payment! The gym was closed due to the pandemic for at least 3 months during this time. We used to have a month to month membership, and we were charged 13.99 a month. We are not able to make contact with anyone who can help us. Check your bills and make sure that you aren't in a scam like we are!</text><GmapID>0x80ea447ba79b74d9:0xd076b28d4cc8611f<//GmapID><resp>None<//resp><Time>1604951167968<//Time>< user>

I cannot recommend avoiding this business strongly enough. They have a predatory sales staff, they have a policy to never refund money, and surprise fees. Really bad people.</Text>

<text>Went as a guest. I am actually please with this BX. If BX a long time ago because they seemed to hire unhappy staff. Who wants to workout where staff is either angry or just in a bad mood. The current morning staff seems a lot better. Not sure if i will stay but we shall see.</text></record>

I LOVE this gym!  I did a lot of research because I wanted a gym that would be good for me and my two toddlers.  My kids love going to the child care; the staff is friendly and they know my girls by name.  Bruce at the front desk always welcomes me, Jeremy is super nice and has been super helpful to my family.  The class schedule works great for me because I like to go mid-morning.  This gym is a GREAT fit for my family.  Affordable, kid-friendly, convenient.</review>

<Text>I've been going to this location since the opening and I've never had one bad experience. It's always clean, the weights are always put back in order, and all staff has always been nice to me. I'm normally there early morning when the crowd is low. You get to meet people that are on the same schedule as you. Highly recommended!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80ea447ba79b74d9:0xd076b28d4cc8611f<//Gmap_id>< rate>

<Text>Visiting from out of town and joined my sister in law in a sculpt class. Brought my son to the daycare.  Everyone treated us great! The gym is clean. The equipment is new. The daycare is awesome and the staff was fantastic.

Coming from running gyms for nearly a decade, I appreciate it when things are done right and the gym is run well.  Thank you Jeremy for your help. You truly understand the value of great customer service and building a community within your gym.

Definitely recommend.<//Text>< pics>

All in all most of the staff is nice. But there’s an employee at the daycare who could be really rude.  I believe her name is Ashlyn, they need to properly train their staff I don’t feel comfortable leaving my baby when she’s working. When I asked if my daughter had a good day? She replied “yes as far as I’m concerned I was also taking care of other kids.” (In front of other parents) It’s not the first time this girl speaks to me in that manner.< /review>

Availability of classes is cool - if you take them. Otherwise it's a hindrance having to plan around when classes are or else you aren't allowed in the studio, even to grab equipment.

Otherwise, staff is friendly and for the most part has everything you'll need equipment wise.< /Review>

Let me preface my comments by saying that the staff is wonderful and courteous at all times. Jeremy the General Manager has always been cordial and professional.

My review is in reference to the recent changes that have been made to this location, specifically the XGT class. I pay my monthly dues, and I find it very inconvenient that members are now limited as to when the aerobics room is available.  I being one of MANY members who are getting increasingly irritated with not being able to utilize the gym facilities as stated in the terms and conditions in our contract. Where does it say that by paying my monthly dues,  it therefore permits my use of the aerobics room on all days EXCEPT Tue, Thur, and Sat due to this “class”? In an effort to cash in on another revenue stream, Body exchange has decided to implement a “gym” within a gym.  A class comprised of a total of 5-6 people at any given time forcing the other members to work around this waste of a class.

First they decided to demolish the ladies spa gym (which I paid EXTRA) in order for my wife and daughters to utilize. Then they justify that extra  cost by telling me it’s to provide me with towel service. Now with this new inconvenience of a class, I can no longer enjoy the gym as desired. At this point after many years of being a Body Exchange member, I can whole heartedly say that it’s time for a change. I’d rather pay extra and drive further to your competitor, than half to deal with this gym’s shortcomings.  I will no longer support this gym’s continuous goal to nickel and dime.< /text>

<name>RMF RMF</name><Time>1512689088553<//Time><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Let me preface my comments by saying that the staff is wonderful and courteous at all times. Jeremy the General Manager has always been cordial and professional.

My review is in reference to the recent changes that have been made to this location, specifically the XGT class. I pay my monthly dues, and I find it very inconvenient that members are now limited as to when the aerobics room is available.  I being one of MANY members who are getting increasingly irritated with not being able to utilize the gym facilities as stated in the terms and conditions in our contract. Where does it say that by paying my monthly dues,  it therefore permits my use of the aerobics room on all days EXCEPT Tue, Thur, and Sat due to this “class”? In an effort to cash in on another revenue stream, Body exchange has decided to implement a “gym” within a gym.  A class comprised of a total of 5-6 people at any given time forcing the other members to work around this waste of a class.

First they decided to demolish the ladies spa gym (which I paid EXTRA) in order for my wife and daughters to utilize. Then they justify that extra  cost by telling me it’s to provide me with towel service. Now with this new inconvenience of a class, I can no longer enjoy the gym as desired. At this point after many years of being a Body Exchange member, I can whole heartedly say that it’s time for a change. I’d rather pay extra and drive further to your competitor, than half to deal with this gym’s shortcomings.  I will no longer support this gym’s continuous goal to nickel and dime.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Date>1521224431015< /Date><rate>2< /rate><Text>Another terrible experience. Whoever designed this place is an idiot. The windows on the west side of the building funnel blinding light into the gym during the evening. They need something to block the sun. The light fixtures are so bright that they burn your eyes when you are laying down trying to lift weights. They could solve this with a diffusing lens on the bottom of the fixture. This was suggested but ignored by the managers. Bad sign when they don't listen to customer complaints. They have tons of cardio machines that no one uses but have only 4 adjustable benches which everyone uses! There are less than 20 people in here now but every single one of those benches is occupied . They combined 2 gyms into one and the weight area now is smaller. If it was more than $10 a month I'd leave.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>When I lived in CA I went here. Staff was rude and unmotivated to work. Never seen staff cleaning the equipment periodically throughout the day and was just overall sick of this place. Then when I tried to cancel my membership they said they couldn't do it that day and I'd have to call back. Then I did and confirmed, yet still got charged the next month and they said they lost my paperwork. Damn scam.<//Text>< Pictures>

It's a brand new gym so the equipmen and location overall is outstanding. The staff is always friendly even though you can tell they are pretending Haha but who in customer service doesn't pretend to like customers? The gym is relatively intimate and few users unless you go during peak hours, of course. That is between 4:30 P.M. and 8ish P.M.<//Review>

Went there two times really bad service I went and waited  20 min for a quesadilla they called the ticket number I ask if it was a quesadilla she totally ignore and repeated the number I ask again is it a quesadilla she said I have various orders with a quesadilla (attitude)and repeated the number again  I told her what I order for her to able to tell me if it was my order, such a bad experience never coming back and the one lady taking orders same bad attitude we ask for suadero tacos and she just moved her head and said no I mean at least say we out of that meat or something she just said no 👎🏼< /Text>

Tacos here are really good. Almost as good as the ones my mom makes. I hate that almost always they run out of chicken super early. The lady that takes your order definitely needs some training in customer service. She never smiles, she's never polite, and if you ask how much longer for your order to be ready, she gives you the nastiest attitude possible them turns to talk bad about you to the guy that makes the food. This spot can easily be a 4.5 stars but because she is so rude they only get 1 star.</text>

<Review>I feel horrible for this review because I don't like to talk mean about small business but it is what it is. The lady is RUDE, personally me I dont go back to a place like this and I'm an all smile second chance  kinda girl but when I spend money somewhere at least great costumes with a smile 😊 and burritos $9 for a small tortilla? And tacos soooo dry and no flavor, salsa was good but I wont go there Nope not again, not ever, not today or tomorrow. Sorry but I hope you apriciate my review and learn from it.< /Review><Date>1548720780889<//Date>< name>

I was very impressed. High quality customer service. I had the MVP which included  a wash and massage. WOW. For first time customers, they discount 50%. Ask for Grace who is very professional, competent, and friendly.< /review>

<text>Took my husband here and he said that his stylist was one of the only ones who took the time to educate him about how his hair grows and the styles/cuts that would best suit him.
Normally he would just go somewhere and request a cut and they would just do it. With this girl, (wish I could remember her name) he talked to her about what he wanted and the problems he would run into with it and she helped educate him and they found a cut and style that suited his growth pattern and was comparable to what he wanted and I've never seen him more confident with a haircut before.</text><pics>None<//pics><time>1551906613461</time><Rate>5< /Rate>< Name>

Best hair Solan I've ever been to, got it for free for first time, workers are polite and like to make conversation, good haircut, washed our hair out after with shampoo, seats comfortable, and TV's to watch while getting your hair cut and while waiting for someone to get their haircut<//text>

< Review>
Came for dinner and we got seated right away.  Service is friendly and quick.  She gave us hot tea to drink when we sat down.   We ordered sea food with meat soup noodles bowl $12.99 and we also ordered black bean seafood noodle on hot skillet $10.99.  Food came quickly and freshly made so it was hot.  It was delicious and the portion size was very large so we took the left over home.  She also brought small side dishes for us to try.   Our bill came out to be around $26 which is very reasonable for seafood dishes.  Overall good food and food experience here.<//Review>

The food here is good and you can get a good bowl of jiajiangmyeon. I haven't tried the jjampong, but it looks quite good.

The dining area is small with about 5 to 6 tables, and can often be full.

I came by on a Thursday evening about 30 to 35 minutes before their listed closing hours and was told that they weren't serving any more customers.

I'm pretty bummed out about this as I don't often eat jiajiangmyeon, and I deliberately went out of my way to get dinner here.

It would be nice if they would update their actual hours on Google and Yelp.< /text>

(Translated by Google) it's delicious. But the Chinese name is Sobo!
If you changed your name, you'd have 10 times in a year.
I'm new to acquaintances.

맛있어요.  근데 중국집 이름이 소보로!

<text>(Translated by Google) I came to see the elf for the first time today.

I ordered Combi B.
Combo b is a set menu with jjajangmyeon + jjamppong + sweet and sour pork. A friendly waitress unnie
Because you can change the jjajang to the iron plate jjajang.
I changed it to teppanyaki jjajangmyeon. The teppanyaki jjajang came out with sizzling sound, smoke and a delicious smell. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It was so delicious to eat with a spoonful. I could eat it hot until I finished eating it. There is seafood king jjambbong. It's perfect to eat with Jjamppong, which is spicy seafood broth.

엘프보고 오늘 처음 왔는데요.

콤비  b   주문해 먹었는데요.
콤보b는 짜장면+짬뽕+탕수육 세트메뉴더라구요.친절한 웨이츄레스언니가
짜장을 철판짜장으로 변경할수있다고해서요.
철판짜장면 으로 바꿔보았는데 .철판짜장이 지글지글 소리와 연기 그리고 맛있는 냄새랑 함께나오는데요.눈을 못 떼겠더라구요.한젓가락 떠서 먹는데 정말 맛있더라구요.다먹을때까지 뜨끈하게 먹을수있었고요.거기에 해물왕짬뽕의 매콤한 해물육수맛의 짬뽕과 함께 먹으니 안성맞춤이네요.나의 맛집으로 정했어요

(Translated by Google) I am sorry to say that this is a great Chinese restaurant for the price. Chadol Champon is feeling a little. Lambs are served in different bowls, so small people can eat together with sweet and sour pork and fried rice.

I feel sorry for you. Beef Jjambbong is a little greasy. Jjamjjamyeon is served in a different bowl. You can order sweet and sour pork or fried rice together and share them.

미안한 마음이 들정도로 가격대비 훌륭한 중국식당입니다. 차돌짬뽕은 좀 느끼합니다. 짬짜면은 각각 다른 그릇에 나와서 양이 작은 사람들은 탕수육이나 볶음밥과 함께 둘이서 먹을수 있습니다.

Food is tasty and fresh. Service and price is reasonable. Only negative is the owner will close the business early and whenever he wants. The business hours depends upon owners descression.</Text>

First time going there and I noticed how clean and organize everything was. The man was very generous to help us pick up the food. Will definitely go there again.< /Text>

<review>It was very busy, small location. It was clean and running smoothly for lunch. Friendly staff and waited in line to order. We ordered street tacos. They were good and for both meals and drinks only $15 so it was a good price also. I recommend this location to try a quick bite to eat.<//review>< pictures>

Very long wait to be considered "street food." Waited 1 hour for 4 naan tacos, gobi manchurian, gajrella and 1 mango lassi. When asked what took them too long, there were no explanations or reasons given. And they didn't even get our order right. We ordered 2 butter chicken tacos, 1 lamb taco and 1 shahi paneer taco. They gave us 2 shahi paneer and 1 butter chicken instead.<//Text>

Food is delicious. We ordered the Thali combination. The person on the phone was so patient with me and I appreciated that as I was all confused on what to put in each plate. Give it a try, it's worth it.</review>

Amazing Food! Great portions, great selection menu, and inexpensive. The only downfall is the limited seating, but other than that 5 stars<//Text>

I'd give it ten stars! Saturday night, the place was pretty packed, but we were still able to sit down. I ordered the Gol Gappe, which was not only tasty, but fun to eat. And also the Chicken Naughty Naan. That was the perfect size and hit the the spot. Despite the masses of people that kept coming in, it felt like a pretty smooth operation. They got our food out quick. The atmosphere is nice. Love the artwork on the walls and the Bollywood films and music playing add a nice touch. Loved the doors for the mens' and womens' restrooms as well. And the prices? Legit. Even for platters. Definitely give this place a go if you're curious.<//review>

<Text>It was our First time here. First and last.
We're new to Indian food so we were asking questions about the menu. We'd been to one other Indian restaurant and the food there was very good so we were looking forward to lunch here. Sadly, they were very upset that we were asking( simple) questions about the menu. We were  told that we should've done research before we came in. We were hungry and pressed for time so we stayed. We ordered two different dishes - they tasted the same but knew that they shouldn't have.
We had been really looking forward to trying a new Indian restaurant but were sorry we every tried them.
It really doesn't matter how the food was because the employees were so rude.< /Text>< GmapID>

This is my second time eating here and I must state that the food was exceptional both times. The taste of the food is exceptional, the service is great and the establishment is clean. Me and my wife ordered the Thali, hers was the vegetarian (Aloo Gobi and Shahi Paneer) option and mine had chicken (Tilka Masala and Butter Chicken). Both plates were very flavorful and to my standards perfectly cooked. I highly recommend Bollywood Indian Street Food, get a taste of something out of the ordinary and be blown away with this great food.</text>

Naan Tacos are a must, best bet for your buck. They're also very delicious, set on a taco tray, so no spilling everywhere. The restaurant was so clean and full of color. The restrooms are also properly kept, and one stall each, so no pileup or lines.<//text>

<Text>Called and they indicated they closed at 7:00 pm so I raced across town to get there with my daughter. Got there at 6:46 and they tell me they are not taking any orders after 6:45 sorry. Absolutely terrible customer service. I do not take the time to usually right reviews but this earned a negative review. Would not recommend coming here and will not recommend to any one else moving forward.<//Text>< name>

Third time bad experience. The order takers does not understand basic Indian dishes and always mess up orders. The younger owner is super arrogant and once complained about, he almost jumps you. None of the dishes are authentic Indian and the quality of food is super cheap. I got sick twice. Im done going to this place.<//text>

I would like to start this by saying that when I walked into the place it smelled wonderful. Like absolutely divine. Well I was so excited to try this place when I seen it online.  I wanted to go there today try a few things and take my family this weekend.   But the girl at the counter was so rude and made me feel so uncomfortable that I let I just left I didn’t know what to do I just left.  I had walked in the door and picked up the menu and was looking it over.  When the customers we’re done at the register and there was nobody up there I walked up. I told the cashier that I had never been here before and I was trying to ask her if she can recommend anything.   Her response was there’s descriptions on the menu .   So then I was trying to tell her that I didn’t know what some of the items in the description were. I was Mid-sentence she literally like turned around and walked away. It was so awkward that I kind of felt embarrassed  and left.  I would still like  go back and try it    But maybe I’ll do some research and read the menu before I go and make sure I know what I want and what everything is.< /text>

The best of two worlds, tacos and Indian food, come together at this place. My husband and I love the Lamb Curry Naan tacos... they are the best! Those pickled onions on top and green chutney make a party in our mouths!</Text>

Fantastic! The perfect lunch spot, with great portions and more than reasonable portions. Friendly service, fun atmosphere. There's really nothing that's left wanting - one of my new favorite Fresno restaurants.

The food itself is worthy of more than a lunch spot. Flavorful and authentic tasting with a very interesting menu. The multiple dishes I've tried have been varied, and all excellent.

This is definitely a restaurant that everyone in Fresno/Clovis needs to try at least once.</Review>

The food is excellent LOVE the flavors, but I had a hard time ordering for many of us who don’t know Indian food it was difficult to know what to order.
The young lady at the register wasn’t very helpful, they really need pictures near the register or a better description of the food or someone who engages with the customer.</review>

The food was ok I was hoping for something spicy but they under delivered on that part. The restaurant is nice and clean as for the food price I would say is on the average side around 10-12 dollars.<//Review>

Bollywood is amazing! I just moved to Fresno from a larger city and was not expecting this gem to be here. This place always has a Bollywood movie playing which is so fun as someone who has never really seen one. They offer Indian tacos & the tacos are delicious! I like the butter chicken and Tikka masala ones best, and the price is on point. The tacos are on reasonably sized naan. I *think* the price is something like 1 for $3, 2 for $5, 3 for $7. We leave there spending under $20 for two people and are totally full. If you're not as excited about Indian tacos as me, they offer more traditional items, but you should still try a taco!!!!!!</review>

<Review>Fantastic Indian food in a casual fast food environment... we had butter chicken, chicken tikka, chilli chicken, naughty paneer naan, garlic naan, papadums... long story short we tried a lot for a 1st visit and none of it disappointed. Great depth of flavors and tender tender chicken... Looking forward to coming back and trying the indian street tacos.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Ok let me tell you  I came from indian so my review will be based on that . I wanted Indian food I went here  go without expecting food like you get in India but it’s ok considering place . Daal was ok nothing special. But sahi paneer is dish to go for it will be heavy to eat but not disappoint  you atleast rest options are decent a bit expensive as compare to other I have heard .

It tasted pretty good but the quantity of filling in tacos was lacking and my husbands order was wrong, we didn't try to get it corrected since we had already waited way too long.  The staff was not very welcoming or apologetic at all due to the wait. Maybe a less busy time would be better but wouldn't rush back.</review>< Rating>

The bowl comes with a kachumber salad but the salad is really a tablespoon. Overall very good and recommended for a quick Indian bite.<//review>< pics>

Great place for lunch or dinner. Enough options not to overwhelm you while making your decision.  Healthy portions, alot of meat compared to other Indian restaurants I've been too. I had the chicken Tikka Masala and Gobi Manchurian both were flavorful and fresh.< /review>

Friendly staff, but the food was absolutely blah.

I ordered lamb curry naan tacos, and I barely got a curry or lamb flavor. Way too much vinegar taste, which drowned out all the other flavors. Occasionally I got a pop of cilantro, but mostly the dish flavor was plain naan with a vinegar wash, almost like they dumped tabasco sauce in it.

Indian food is supposed to be rich and flavorful, especially lamb. This seemed like a watered down "Americanized" version but still keeping the price tag of fine Indian food.

Very disappointing.<//Review>

If you are punjabi or Indian than you will probably not gona like it, but if you are any other race then you will probably like it. The place is good and clean. The food was alright it was not good as I expected.</review>

The food was some of the best Indian food I’ve had and that’s saying something because I’m Indian, I recommend getting the fried fish or the lamb chops<//review>

<review>Got a pickup order from this place to take for a special event. Get to our place didn't realize they didn't put plastic forks in the bag. Ruined our whole special night. McDonald's at least puts a fork in the bag when needed. Lady told me you should have got it yourself by the soda machine.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80945dcc856a4fd1:0x8fb8ca569e75acf</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We arrived for lunch, the open sign was on and flashing. Although on the door it said will be closed from 3-4. Confused we open the door to find the place full of people eating and several people in the process of ordering. Once our turn we try to order and were told they were closed, confirming the sign on the door. We waited an hour to come back at the time they said they'd be open. We open the door once again, to find the place busy with people eating. We asked if they were open, we were told yes, we go up to order after looking at the menu for about 5 minutes and immediatly were told that they were closed again and will open at 5. Please use extreme caution when planning a weekend lunch, be sure to have a plan B.</Review><user>114643919148944095530< /user>< date>

Food was delicious. Very busy so had to be patient. No bartender when we were there so server had to make drinks. Staff was friendly. Steak was very flavorful!</Review>

<Text>Excellent service and fabulous food and drinks. They were very short staffed but did their best. The crew took extremely good care of us and the food always came out the right temp and tasting great. Felt safe in pandemic times. My table will definitely be back!!<//Text>< gmap_id>

<user>112844822838510993857< /user><Review>The other reviews were right about the place being busy and service being slow. We waited for ten minutes at the entrance before anyone would acknowledge us. The reservation we had didn't work,  we got seated outside and left to ponder. We chose to move back in and eat at the bar counter where the lady who served us was very cordial and efficient. Food is not of the quality you see in Biba or Il Fornaio, but not bad. Overall, I appreciate the hard working staff, but don't see myself returning. Again,  not bad,  but nothing compelling.</Review><date>1621109471149<//date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We had a party of 9. The service was top notch. Our group went for the Timpano that they only make once a month. It's unique and a lot to eat. It was a little dry my opinion and could use a more sauce. Because everybody ordered the Timpano I ordered the Italian Fried Chicken big mistake. Way over cooked extremely dry.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNn-FP6h1ST3ZXhrWPy88p8AAwLJHVzeNWLjRUZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmJuSBf942JXuP5Gnj4-aDC9mDaebkemATpQIA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHMEzAfmXTz0mLdKs64g5jGFjaYhqmlIPt3ngA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Covid dinner with appropriate distancing. Service was excellent. Food a solid good. Wine selection is good; the pours are a little scant. I had calamari appetizer and a dinner salad with shrimp Louie which did not taste bad, but not like shrimp Louie. Good experience overall.</Review><response>None< /response><user>101393668188525855904</user><Name>Kamran Sahrakar< /Name>< Rate>

<Text>My girl had the salmon alfredo. The salmon was plentiful and cooked to perfection. The noodles were tasty and tender and the sauce flavorful but not overbearing. I had linguine with clams. The clams were delicious and very plentiful,  the wine based sauce delightful,  and the linguine so tender I suspect it was fresh made in house. We loved it!</Text>< Pics>

Great variety of (street-sized) tacos on the menu that allows you to try several and find your favorites.  Plenty of sink options as well as patio dining options.  Laid back, easy sevice makes for a nice meal out and the relaxed atmosphere adds to your ability to just enjoy the time out alone or with friends.</review>

<Review>Waitress and staff were excellent. The pasta dishes ordered by my party were solid, but my prime rib was old and reheated for service... otherwise it would be a four or five star.

I appreciate the reply, but I eat at the House of Prime Rib in SF and the steak was thrown on a flat top for service and the meat was a dull pink, not overcooked, just sitting out. We came here on a recommendation. We had a reservation, but sat out in the lobby hallway; did not have silverware; and ate while people waited outside the restaurant and watched. As I said, the wait staff was excellent, but ordering a prime rib for Christmas Eve dinner as a special on the menu was underwhelming. We opened a $ 300+ bottle, so yeah I was disappointed and would have returned the steak if it was overcooked. Just being honest. Plates need to be checked before they come out.< /Review>< rating>

I had an ok experience originally picking up the order, but they missed a few items....

I told the customer that I would call and personally come pick up and deliver the missing items after my last stop.

But I was shocked when I called & spoke with I believe a supervisor. I'm not sure if we had a bad connected, a miss understanding or if she was having a bad day, but she made me feel awful! If anything I'm just more confused why I was treated like trash the first time I came in as a Postmates driver and not as a paying customer</review>< Pictures>

<text>This place popped up on my doordash suggestions, the order was prompt and included utensils and napkins and extra sauce.
I'm not sure what is bringing you to a place like this, but let me stress to you that a sandwich is not just a sandwich from their menu.
I have not had that kind of quality in a "chicken sandwich" in Sacramento since my time in the Navy. The veggie toppings, sauce used, meaty flavorful cut of chicken, bacon that was crispy and completely cooked near melting in your mouth. The sauce used was light with no offending outlier and stressed the hint of garlic. The bread choice was really what I'm proud of as it was soft even after warmed up the next day. The steak sandwich, with it's garlic aoli, left it's taste on my mind for a few days.
I had a sort of a picnic planned out, which fell though, which was why I ordered sandwiches from a place like this. I haven't yet tried the other parts to the order but I wanted to stress the uncanny quality and taste from this place. I'm sure I'll be ordering from them again.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

My server Cassandra reviewed the wine list with me and offered samples of two of the pinot noirs by glass: 16 Sean Minor and 15 Saintsbury. I chose the Sean Minor. For a second glass, Cassandra suggested the 16 Atrea Blend. I'd seen the Pavarotti film where he makes spaghetti and decided to try the Spaghetti Bolognese & Meatballs and a Caprese salad. The Spaghetti was disappointing--mostly meat sauce and meatballs. Luciano probably wouldn't like it. Letter grades are as follows:</Text>< Pics>

I have been coming to this restaurant for years, and the food and service are spectacular. The new owners work very hard on ensuring their customers are happy. We came last night and we had never seen this little restaurant soo busy! While the place was full we still had the same great service and wonderful food. The staff was working so hard with smiling faces. This shows that they enjoy their jobs and I believe that is a direct representation of the management. We are happy for their success and will return soon.<//review>

<Text>If you like a long wait and to be ignored after you are seated, come to this place. I finally got a speck of attention when my party was fed up, got up and left. Sadly I also noticed that I was the only woman of color in the establishment. Was it coincidence? I don't know but my children also noticed. Places like this pain me. I am sorry that I ever considered this place for a dinner choice. Good riddance.<//Text><rating>1</rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< Time>

Both of us were craving an easy as well as scrumptious supper. A long journey house led us to calling in a favor from mommy to get us right into Vinoteca. Also with a special Valentine food selection they still made us our routine food selection items of fried poultry and also Picatta tonight it was Veal.<//text>

<Text>FANTASTIC !!!
Great service from start to finish.
The fried chicken is the best I have ever had. Perfection again with the salmon fettuccine
Will be back again soon. My son and I were pleasantly surprised with such a unknown GEM to us. I read a couple of bad reviews ...however they must be ...way over the top needy and pretentious . i< /Text>< pics>

<Review>The Mr and I were trying to hunt for some Italian food and drove by this area. It was an impromptu browse through but we were seated instantly. The service was excellent overall. We purchased:1) Garlic bread (5\/5) - this bread was fresh, and tasted outstanding - soft, with shredded garlic bits paired with a delicious marinara sauce. We also dipped it right into the vinegarette\/oil and also it was laaavelyy! 2) Gnocchi with Gorgonzola lotion (4\/5) - I got it with chicken. It was excellent, yet I've had better ones which is why I took a point off. It was a large section dimension for me. A little bit bland imo.3) Jumbo scallops with risotto (3\/5) - the portion sizing was off on this meal - it's a great deal of risotto, with 4 \"little\" scallops. According to my male, the meal coulda utilized some sauce. Nothing much to write home aboutIt resembles a casual-ish Italian joint, which is why I was surprised just how $$ our overall was considering we really did not get a great deal.< /Review>< username>

<Text>Great service and great food. Dipping sauce for bread was wonderful! The chicken parmesan was really tender and flavorful, over pasta of just the right consistency for me. Insalata italiana could have been a little more robust (it was more oil than vinaigrette), but still good. Comfortable atmosphere. A repeat will be in order.< /Text><username>Nona Strong< /username>< date>

I ordered the fried chicken and my wife got the scallops. For dessert we had the banana cream pie. Everything was bland and linear. It reminded me of my mamma's cooking (not great) lol.

Update: The owner reached out to me to thank me for the honest feedback. This is a sign of great leadership and willingness to learn and grow. For this, I added another 🌟!</text>

Food could be better. Many of their menu items are made in advance and frozen. I don't know why they do this, as their cooks spend a lot of time meandering on the line and joking around.</Review>

Had a delicious lunch here today.  The bread and herbed olive oil/balsamic was amazing!  I had a yummy gazpacho soup and my partner had a tender flavorful steak sandwich.  Service was excellent.  We raved so much about the bread our waitress sent some home with us along with a container of the dipping oil.  Would highly recimmend them.< /review>

We ordered a dish with red sauce and one with cream sauce. The overarching theme was a lack of flavor. The red sauce was so bland. Like they had cracked the can and poured it on. The noodles needed generous amounts of salt and pepper to bring out any flavor. The ceasar dressing was great though. The food is just not worth it sad to say.</Text>

<text>Good service and nice decor but the pizza is really weak. Get something other than the pizza. I had the margarita.  Pink flavorless tomatoes, sauce that was overwhelmed by the taste of dried oregano, and a cracker like crust with no rise to the dough.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

<review>We gave been going to Vinoteca for special occasions for over a decade and have always had excellent meals. But since the ownership and chef have changed, what a difference . No longer the great Italian dining experience. Nothing any of the four of us ordered was even mediocre, .so sad

We’ve been dining here for 20+ years and have enjoyed the gradual transition by the new owners to making the restaurant their own. We’ve enjoyed the favs that have remained on the menu including the potato gnocchi, complimentary focaccia bread & garlicky dipping sauce, and also loved the newer touches like the
new fried asparagus appetizer, minestrone, Italian fried chicken, mahimahi penne pasta with veggies. I like the way that dishes are not over salted; the new waitress Kylie, asked the kitchen about non-dairy options to their creamy sauces. The only change that could make this restaurant even better would be to offer non-dairy options for cappuccino, coffee creamer, and dessert. It’s still a noisy environment with brisk happy hour until 6pm. We will return soon! 4.5 rating< /Text>

Ordered at 6pm, was supposed to arrive by 7 but was almost 45 minutes late via grubhub. Food was cold and very over cooked. For the price I paid I am very dissatisfied.< /Review>

Residents of Arden park don't have to drive downtown for a sophisticated, first-rate meal.  Located in Arden Town Center, Cafe Vinoteca serves some of the loveliest, most exuberant Italian-inspired cuisine in the city.  However, location is the drawback here as it doesn't feel inspired or transformative from the everyday.< /Text>

Always love eating here especially for our birthdays or our anniversay.  Excellent food - they will make just about anything you desire, within reason, if it's not on the menu. Lovely neighborhood restaurant - lots of parking.  Going tonight!!

Went for dinner on a Sunday evening. Had to wait a very long time for service.
Very noisy. Could hardly hear our selves talking. My friend's eyes were watering from smoke from the grill coming into the restaurant. We are vegetarian and we ordered whole wheat pasta with marinara and mixed vegetables. This was not on the menu, but had to be created. We wanted mushrooms and broccoli in the mix. Broccoli was not available and the mushrooms did not come. There were onions, zuchinni and green beans. They charged us $19.00 for this dish!  This was $7.00 more than their cheese tortellini with mushrooms and their corn ravioli! They clearly don't know about vegan options and they are terribly expensive. My friend wanted salmon, but they only had farm raised, not wild salmon. So, I would not recommend this place  if you want vegetarian or vegan options or if you want a comfortable place to talk.</review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I ordered two tuna sandwiches and there was barely any tuna on them. There was cheese on one(I didn't ask for cheese) and olives on the other(didn't ask for that either). I ordered bacon on one, the bacon wasn't even cooked. The worse experience I've ever had with a subway definitely not going back.<//text>< date>

<Review>I usually come in the morning and the employees always greet me. The one that helped me was really sweet and always nice, always asks if there's anything else I need. Great customer service. Clean and well stocked restaurant. There are wait times, but that is supposed to be expected, as it is a popular restaurant. Either way, good customer service.<//Review><Date>1518486185520<//Date><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

<review>One of the girls working there was very rude. She greeted me and asked what I want, and I told her I wasn't ready. My bf ordered, then she asked me in a demanding way again , what u want. I told her I wasn't ready. I got a phone call from my mom and asked her what she wanted, and the girl still demanded me to tell her what I wanted. I said , wait!. So I proceeded after I felt pressured to tell her right away. There was no one else on line, and I needed to be there by the counter to look at the style of subways to make my decision. Over all, I felt like her frustration of being at work shouldn't be put to the customers. I had already been sick that day and I nicely told her that I wasn't ready because I wanted to get something else that wasn't going to hurt my stomach. But, I'm not going back to that Subway, just so I won't have to get treated like that , again.</review>< user>

It's 9:30 at night and it doesn't say they close until 11pm. Guess what? They are closed! Why? There's no reason either, and the workers are standing in there not doing anything about the people who were standing out here.

You just lost business. 😌<//text>

This place was horrible! I cant believe how poor the service was here! From the start the man was giving me an attitude did not even say hello or how can I help you! all he said was which bread did I want being that I wanted 2 sandwiches,and when I had told him which bread for the first sandwich he rudely interrupted  me and said "Just tell me what breads you want for both, its easier that way". Then as he was scooping the meat to make my sandwich, he would shake some off before putting it on the sandwich!! When I had asked him to put a little more meat because I noticed he shook some ff, he said it would cost extra! Never in all my years of going to Subway have i been told to pay an extra charge for a little more meat!! Then if this wasn't horrible enough, the girls who were completing the sandwiches were just standing around talking and when they finally decided to assist me, they were completely rude and started giggling at each other!! In the end the sandwiched were  completely disgusting! They did not make it the way I asked, and had put so much bell pepper and hardly 5 pieces of onion!  This was literally THE WORST customer service experience that I have ever experienced anywhere! I already sent an e-mail to corporate and am currently waiting for a response. I will never go to subway EVER AGAIN! And I will make sure that anyone I know doesn't have to go through a horrible subway experience! Me and my family were very upset!</Text>

< review>
They were about to close in 30mins.So LADY rushed making my sandwich Because she probably could not wait to get HOME.Tomatoes were very stale,no avocado as usuall,sandwich poorly put together and customer service was horrible to say the LEAST.This lady just kept rushing me and was more concerned about getting off work.This is by far the worst Subway I have ever been to.</review>

<Review>Kenneth from Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield provided so much help throughout the whole process of purchasing my newest vehicle! Such an easy process as well. Not to mention they had great customer service! I look forward in purchasing vehicles from them in the near future. Make sure you ask for Kenneth when you want to purchase a vehicle.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Thank you Fernando and Jake for getting my husband in his dream car. He’s still can’t believe it.  My car is amazing too. I have always owned a Lexus since my late 20’s and will continue ‘til I die. Most trusted vehicle with best luxury feel and comfort. Such style, class and beauty. What helps me make decisions is having good people working with me as well. Not every dealership can provide that. You guys did. It’s always nice to have good, honest people to help in that transition. You gave us what we wanted and asked for. THANK YOU! Looking forward to our next purchase with you all. Easy in and out. Btw, Bakersfield Lexus IS a very nice dealership. Updated technology was impressive as well.</Text>

I have been to over a dozen dealerships throughout my life and this is by far the best dealership I stepped foot into. I was greeted the second I got out of my car and was able to test drive within minutes. The salesmen Fernando was incredibly helpful and an amazing guy. Also shout out to Ali the general manager he’s a great man too! Their reviews truly reflect their performances and professionalism.<//Text>

Working with Fernando was AMAZING! 🤩 He worked around my busy work and family schedules. We did everything virtually with a few texts messages between all my appointments and all I had to do was walk in and sign papers.

So EXCITED and THANKFUL to be back with Motor City Lexus!<//Text>

Nader’s customer service is amazing, he treated us with respect and showed real interest in what we were looking for. He facilitated the process and was able to answer all our questions. Must say we were very happy we went there and met him. Would highly recommend Motor City Lexus to everyone looking for a car and don't forget to ask for Nader.< /Review>

I went in a walked out with a new car. The experience was very fast and easy going. Vanessa was so great I’ve never had a woman salesperson and when I say I told her what I could afford she made sure I got what I wanted and everyone I came across was very pleasant. I really recommend Lexus and I’ll be back in the near future!<//Text>

Could not have been happier with this car buying experience! They knew what I wanted even though I didn't. Traded in my old car (which we got from them) and got a 2017 Rav 4. Love this vehicle it was very clean and they filled it up before we drove off. Kenny made the experience very easy. Making us comfortable, bringing waters, and updating us on the loan process. Love this place they even have a coffee station. I definitely recommend going here to get either a new or used vehicle!< /text>

<review>I normally do not purchase my vehicles in Bakersfield because I've not had much success in dealing with sales people that actually wanted to make a sale. However, I decided to try again with Motor City Lexus and what a difference! Fernando Villagomez and the rest of the staff made the experience a pleasant one. He is friendly, professional and clearly wanted our business. I was impressed with the high quality of their inventory even for used vehicles. Thanks so much for turning what is usually a dreadful experience into a much a better one. I highly recommend this dealership and ask for Fernando.</review>< pictures>

Every visit is great. My wife recently leased the Gx460.
Fernando is our guy. He helped us with now two Lexus vehicles. Never had any question left unanswered. Lexus of Bakersfield has been helpful and attentive to our needs in a particular vehicle and what our budget dictates. We love the Lexus family and we’re happy to be a part of the Lexus family! We like to thank Lance our finance guy and we like to thank Mr. Castillo, sales manager, for all the hard work they do.</review>

I went to Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield to test drive a car I subsequently purchased. I was prepared for, ya know, the pesky, intrusive, obnoxious car dealer we all brace ourselves for... SO NOT TRUE HERE!!! Vanessa Bustamante was my salesperson and it was actually a really great experience! She was knowledgeable snd informative.. as opposed to being a ‘know it all’. She was helpful and supportive.. as opposed to pushy and leading. I know, that for any of my future car purchases, I will go there first and I highly recommend a person in the market for a car check them out as well!! WOW.. who would have thought it would actually be a really pleasant experience! I’m so pleased!!  Thank you Vanessa!! I love my new car!!<//Text>

<name>Bernardo Baso</name><review>My son could not find the right color RX450 in the bay area and I found one on this dealer. Since my daughter is buying us one for Christmas and they also have the one I like, I talked to Julio and fixed an appointment to see/buy the cars before 11 am the next day. My son drove almost 200 miles that night to my place for the 11:00 am appointment and around 9 am we are getting ready to drive another hour and a half to this dealer. Julio called to tell us that one of the cars we want was gone! He knew how far these people are driving to buy this car but that did not stop them from selling the car after we talked. Beware of this dealership when they make a promise.< /review></record></dataset><record>

In the hunt for a car, especially a Lexus, you'd rather not have to settle for anything less than what you are looking for; any level of inconvenience should come with a price.

My guy, Julio, was certain that the two cars we were looking for were indeed in stock and ready to go. Being from the Bay Area, we figured it'd be worth the trek if the price was right - which seemed to be the case based on the online pricing.

However, once at our pit stop in a nearby town, we awoke to one of the two cars no longer available! Needless to say, Julio done goofed. So here we are, already 3/4 of the way to the dealer, realizing one of the cars we wanted is no longer there. Numbers were presented by Julio which ultimately didn't equate to what we felt was fair: the price of inconvenience.

Julio didn't attempt to keep us around for very long and almost immediately let us go. Heck of a feeling when you are told that some cars will be held for you, you make the effort to drive all the way down, only to be told "SIKE! Would you care for a silver one? Same price though"<//text>

I purchased a Lexus which had been a lease return from my son. Issa handled every detail.  Since I live 600 miles from the dealership, I relied on Issa for every step.  It was actually easier than any other buying experience I’ve ever had.  And I have purchased many autos.  The SUV was delivered to my home in Oregon as promised and I would not hesitate to do another transaction in the future with Issa and Motor City. 5 stars<//Text>

Very enjoyable professional experience. Motor City came highly recommended so we made the 3 hour one way trip to see for ourselves. Their selection and attention to our needs and wants was second to none. This company has a great culture from speaking to several.employees.<//Review>

Brought my Lexus in for a problem. Was able to speak with lead tech personally as I requested.I was given a courtesy car, I came in from out of town.  My car was fixed very quickly. Great service from start to finish. Motor City Lexus IS my choice for all my Lexus service needs. I don’t mind the 2 hour drive from my home. They are worth the drive.<//Text>

There was nothing more that could have made our buying experience more wonderful than it was! John Reed was absolutely phenomenal! We actually only went to get our oil changed and ended up buying not one, but two vehicles from him! He was honest, upfront, extremely personable and not pushy...which we appreciated!!  John made the buying experience comfortable and actually fun even in this crazy pandemic environment we are currently in. John has us as customers for life and will be recommending him to both friends and family. He has not only became our go to sales guy, but our now our friend! When our lease is up, we will reaching out to John to help us with our next Lexus lease.

I just wanted to share my great experience buying a car from this store. I personally work in the car business myself and I've never witnessed the level of customer service from any car dealer.
FERNANDO VILLAGOMEZ was my salesman and he provided the highest level of service possible.

The car was for my brother in San Jose. None of us step foot in the foot and still in the smoothest transaction.  They gave us a great price upfront and had the car delivered ahead of schedule.  Marcela Torres in finance was as professional as they come. She explained all the options available to protect the vehicle and the paperwork was perfect.

I highly recommend this store and will be referring anyone I know that is looking for a car to
FERNANDO VILLAGOMEZ.  Don't be afraid to shop out of your area for the best service and value. This was truly an unforgettable experience. Thank you MCL.< /review>

<Review>Just bought our second Lexus at Motor City Lexus! The sales people there are amazing. We asked for Jim Ballard since he’s the one who sold us our first car.  He is an excellent sales man. Very friendly & knowledgeable. If you’re ever in the need for a new car, ask for Jim. You will not be disappointed! Everything went smooth, to the test drives & all the way to signing the papers. They were all so nice & made us feel comfortable with the process.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate>< pics>

This review is for the service department of Lexus. All customers should triple check their cars and make sure it matches up with the service report. I can't count how many times I've had my Lexus serviced here and the report says something is done when it actually was never done (tire pressure) (floor mats secured) (fluids, windshield cleaner). I don't know why this is such an issue with the service department or why they can't simply do honest work 🙄 but it doesn't make me trust them with servicing my vehicle, especially with this last visit, we noticed our tire pressure was not checked or corrected properly and come to find out we had a nail in our tire and could have gotten into a serious accident if we hadn't come back to confront the issue. They are fixing the issue now.</text>

I have a non Lexus vehicle that was purchased there with a warranty. They didn't treat me different from any normal Lexus owner. They were prompt and courteous and Curtis was excellent with me. Car was done when promised and washed. Customer lounge is really nice too. Thank you very much for everything.<//Review>

Couldn’t have been happier with the service at Motor City Lexus. Everyone there is as polite as they can be and they go out of the way to take care of your needs.

<Text>Do NOT buy a Lexus from this dealership!! The staff here is dishonest and awful to deal with!  They have good prices because they are selling damaged cars that have hidden problems.  They sold me a car that only has 10k miles on it and is a year old, but has a whole slew of issues that they did not disclose prior to purchasing. It is going to cost over $4000 to have all the problems fixed. Now that I’m trying to get the problems rectified they aren’t returning my calls as promised, and acknowledged they knew the car wasn’t in great shape as previously stated.  This is the worst car buying experience I’ve ever had!!  Take your business elsewhere if you want a car that doesn’t have issues. The Lexus certification at this dealership means nothing. Lexus of Bakersfield will go to any cost to sell a car including being dishonest about the integrity of the L-Lexus certified cars they are selling. Please shop around and know Lexus of Bakersfield is able to offer the best price because you are not getting the same quality of car that you would get at another Lexus dealership.</Text>< Pictures>

Recently bought a car here not even 30 days in and I already have a problem I believe I’m not the first one to say that they sell you a car with hidden damages. Since now that I have this car I have been looking at their ratings and they say the same thing. Don’t ever buy a Lexus here my insurance said they have never seen a problem like this before.< /text>

I had the best experience with this dealership, I went last week not to buy a vehicle but to sell one. I met Julio Velasquez the first day, he was very honest, humble and very PROFESSIONAL Julio gave me the confidence that I was looking for on a vehicle adviser.
I went back yesterday Julio pointed to the right vehicle. He explained to me by detail all my numbers, he did it on a easy way that I was able to understand at the first time.

Then I met the other IMPORTANT PERSON; Marcela Torres (Financing Department), she was so PROFESSIONAL and had an easy way to go thru the financing contract, she has this innovation equipment that its easy to understand those numbers, I really felt like I was dealing with people that really care about me and my needs

I will deferentially recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking for honestly and quality

God Bless you all and Thank you Lexus for Having People like them working for you.....

Sincerely,
Luis Naranjo<//review>

Issa and Ali, took extra time to find a car that matched my specific needs is a commuter. I feel like they looked at not only my safety but also longevity of a vehicle as it applied to me. Me and my family felt very welcome and it was a very comfortable non pressured experience. They have earned our family's future business for sure.<//review>

DEFINITELY speak to ALORA. She is excited about cars, knows her cars, knows the job. She gives fair deals, and is beyond knowledgeable with the legal process because I had particular circumstances (trust me I’ve spent hours on the phone with her). Her customer service is second to none, and did I mention she is fair with the prices? She made this whole process of buying from a dealer SO much more enjoyable. Above and beyond and could not be happier. As much as this sounds like some fake review, it’s not, this was my first dealership experience and she was MORE than fair. And I was HAPPY to do business by the time I walked out of there, keys in hand. I liked her enough to spend time writing this review, which I have never done for another business. Take my advice.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I recently purchased my first Lexus, and was blown-away by the amazing customer service I received and the way I was treated from the moment I stepped onto the lot until I drove away in my new Lexus IS 300 Sport!

All of my questions were answered, I never felt rushed or pressured, and it was obvious that the employees are *genuinely*  concerned with the customer as a person and not just interested in selling a car.

Ali (GM), Marcella (Finance), and Dakotah deserve personal recognition for going above-and-beyond to make my car-buying experience one I will not soon forget!

I'm of course in love with my new car, but also enamored and impressed with the superior service offered at Motor City Lexus!<//Text>< pics>

Service was done, my service advisor angel was great and was out to lunch when I arrived to pick up my car.  I have a question with service work, the service advisor manager didn’t help me, he just sit on his desk, Michael service tech lead come out and explaining things, he was very helpful, explain everything about what was done and why it wasn’t completely mark correctly. What I found out is that service tech work by the car complete the faster you fix it, the more money he makes. There’s no more take your time make sure it’s done right, I have to bring back my car to rotate the tires cause I don’t think it was done</Text>

<Review>Great and consistent Service Representatives, friendly and thorough regarding work to be performed.  As always, my car was washed before being returned, and no smudges or traces that service personnel were in the car. Appreciated the loaner car (a great way to test drive a current year LEXUS RX since it was available) for the duration of the service and unexpected repair.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Good Evening,

This is pertaining to especially Rick Perez, because I had spoke with him months prior, but was not really interested in the Buick car.

However, I always had much respect at his approach to his way of sales. He is stellar, honest, and I waited although continued my search for a automobile, but held out over many variables at other dealerships that in my opinion were unsavory.

Furthermore, I am no expert in the car business at all. I have worked in a very high standard restaurant/hotel on the coast for ten years called The Cliffs Resort. I must say that your people carry themselves with the same dignity and respect. I know that I purchased a great used Jeep for the price. I looked everywhere, and no one has better integrity, morals, values than your dealership.

Moreover, I am thankful and grateful to you. Much appreciated for the time to get my other car home, the inspection, lower financing than my own bank. Your parts department  told me of extra things done too. I hope this covers everything.

Sincerely,
Sherry Richards</text>

<Text>Always a great experience when I’ve come to service my vehicle. They let you use another car for the day so you don’t need to wait or take a shuttle. It’s so convenient. The staff are always friendly and helpful. I also enjoy the complementary coffee and snacks!<//Text>< gmapID>

This is by far the best dealer we’ve dealt with due to their smooth transaction process and professional environment. Customer satisfaction is their priority that they even offered us to bring the car home before buying it. The sales people who took care of us are Jay Singh and John Reed. I’ll definitely come back for my next car purchase.< /text>

He was willing to show us every aspect of the car we were considering, even moving 2 cars from the showroom floor outside so we could see the colors in sunlight.  Jim allowed us to test drive as many vehicles as we asked. I've purchased numerous new vehicles from dealerships, Jim made my purchase go smoother than I have ever experienced and absolutely made my day.!   I left with the exact car I wanted and with a huge smile on my face. Keep up the great work....The dealership is beautiful.<//review><userid>105684068450727404781<//userid>< Date>

<review>Pretty good experience. Not completely happy with their lack of willingness to work lower on the price. But in that respect, all dealerships are the same! Customers are always with out a doudt second, when it comes to the pricing the the car. Anyhow, the process was easy and the people were nice. So far, no problems with he used car I purchased. Hope that continues to stay that way. So in conclusion, had they worked harder to give the price I'd asked for they'd be getting 5stars instead it is 4.< /review><Response>None< /Response>< Name>

I was advised by my service consultant Angel Del Rio that I needed new tires and he ensured I got the best deal and even helped me pick out new tires. I was hesitant spending so much money on my service but I'm so glad I did because my car is running like just like when I first bought it. Thank you Angel, front desk ladies who helped me get a loaner car & provided exceptional customer service, and everyone else at Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield as the service I received was excellent. I will continue to be back as a customer because you all continue to get it right every time! If you own a Lexus and are hesitant about getting service done due to cost understand that is completely normal- but part of owning a luxury car is maintaining it and you will be able to maintain your car condition if you take it to Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield or any Lexus dealership.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Walking into Motor City Lexus for the first time was by far the best experience I have ever had leasing my first vehicle. From the moment being greeted by the receptionist to meeting our car salesman, Rocky. He definitely gave us a peace of mind throughout our whole experience. I was recommended to go to Rocky and he definitely lived up to the expectations. And so now I can say the same when being asked about my Lexus. Thank you so much Motor City Lexus for a wonderful experience. The customer service was outstanding and I'll definitely continue to do business with Motor City Lexus!< /Text>< name>

<text>My salesman was Jeremy Beck, and he was excellent. He was friendly and helpful, answered all my questions completely, and followed me throughout the whole process of leasing my new Envision. I have purchased a number of vehicles at Motor City, and I have always found the people and the process excellent to the highest degree. Both Chris Arias and Johnnie Martinez have helped me in the past and were both excellent. In addition I have found the Buick maintenance people superior to those in other auto dealerships. Overall, Motor City Buick rates more than the five stars I have given.</text><time>1465325838862</time><name>Don Stansbury<//name>< Rate>

I felt intimidated to even think of buying a car here but I felt very welcomed and Jim made me feel comfortable. Because of the great team at Motor City Lexus, I was able to leave the lot with a brand new white 2016 Lexus IS 200t F Sport with red interior! I've only had the car for 5 days and I love it!! I feel so safe in it.

Keep doing what you're doing, guys! You guys are awesome! Now I can't wait to experience the amazing customer service when I get my first maintenance done!</Review>

< review>
We recently went to trade in our Lexus that we bought at Motor City Lexus and found out on Carfax that there was an accident when Motor City owned it. At the time when we were purchasing the car from MCL this accident did not post on the Carfax report considering it was only 11 months old.The accident happened 5 months prior to us purchasing it. Motor City Lexus owned the vehicle and definitely knew about this but never disclosed this to us. As a result, the cars value has taken a drop in regards to resale/trade in value despite the fact that it is excellent condition and low mileage. Worse yet the Carfax reports states that during the accident the airbags failed to deploy.

Bottom line is Motor City Lexus management are completely dishonest people.< /review>

Mo Omar was very professional, courteous and helpful.  He tried to help me get the best deal he could and when he could not do any more he told me so.  I knew it was the lowest price he could offer based on responses from other dealers.  I will give him 5 star.  The staff at Motor City was very helpful also.< /text>

From start to finish, every step was great from our first visit, minimal professional negociations, sales product presentation and our final delivery experience was perfect!  Mark's team Julio and Parker were the best.  Thanks again Motor City Lexus, we will return and will most certainly recommend your Lexus dealership.!</Review>

<Text>Motor City Lexus has the best customer service of any dealership I've ever seen. We bought our Lexus used from Motor City 10 years ago and they had done all the service before we bought it, so we continued to go see them. Our service writer Bruce Weihe has been nothing short of fantastic. Always friendly and professional. He recommends what we need and always tells us what is needed and what is optional but recommended. He always has the answers for our questions honestly. The mechanics are excellent, always doing the job right the first time, never "patching" things together. Will continue to trust Bruce as long as we have a Lexus.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2< /gmap_id></record>

Always Awesome!  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Due to the distance I travel to use Motor City Lexus in Bakersfield I enjoy the loaner vehicles.  It makes it easier to work and still get my car serviced by the best!!</Text>

Exceptional service and professionalism. The experience of going to a dealership could be excruciating but that is not the case at Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield. Ali and Faraz are from this point forward my go to guys when it comes to buying a vehicle- new or used. They made the experience hassle free. Just like my mechanic, my mattress guy, my handyman it's hard to find people you trust- I trust Ali & Faraz. I shopped around, did my research and they came through with the vehicle I wanted at the price that beat the competitors. They were knowledgeable and took the time to answer all my questions. I drove off knowing that I would be back with family members who are looking for the kind of service these two men provide. At the end of the day Ali was referred to me by a co-worker. Turns out his reputation is impeccable. Over 400 deals with our agency! All repeat customers. Thank You for your assistance in purchasing a quality vehicle.<//text>

The only small complaint I have is when I originally called over there the lady who answered didn't know how to answer my question and someone was supposed to call me back.....no one did. I had to call back and that time I got all my questions answered.  The service experience was smooth.</Text>

Service and sales at Motor City Lexus has always been professional, friendly and efficient.  Everyone I have had contact with at the dealership is an outstanding representative of the Lexus brand.  In fact, that is the reason I choose to drive a Lexus and do business with Motor City.  One standout is Angel Del Rio, our Service Consultant for our last few visits.  He has always gone above and beyond the call of duty to help us even when we had an emergency.  Thank You!!<//text>

My experience leasing my new car at Motor City Lexus was by far the most professional and customer focused experience ever – and I’ve leased and purchased cars for many years from many high-end brands. From the greeting to drive off, I experienced professional, knowledgeable and service-centric engagements with all staff. The experience was all about me as it should be, but most often is not; what car and terms that I wanted and how to make it happen. Mo Omar took exceptional care of me throughout the process and his follow-up confirms that the long term relationship with Motor City Lexus is as important as the sale.<//review>

WE had an amazing experience.  After 50 years of buying cars this was the most convenient, non pushy, professional service we have ever received.  Omar as exceptional in his knowledge, attitude and personal attention to our requests and the details.  The entire process from looking at the first truck to the financing, everyone was not only friendly and caring but went out of their way to offer congratulations and well wishes.   A truly incredible experience and we would HIGHLY RECOMMEND  Motor city to everyone interested in a great selection and truck/car buying experience.< /review>

By far the best car buying experience I've ever had. Every single employee at the dealership was nothing but friendly and respectful. James and Franz took excellent care of me by making sure I drove away with exactly what I wanted and went out of their way to make the experience as easy as possible. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend anyone to this team to purchase their next vehicle.</review>

<Text>Mark was an exceptional salesman! We came in with the idea of "weighing our options" about purchasing a new vehicle and Mark went above and beyond, by putting our minds at ease and making us feel comfortable and welcome to just talk.  He provided us with all the information needed to make our final decision and came through for us with the help of Oscar Salazar. It was a great experience and we look forward to purchasing future vehicles with Motor City!<//Text>< pictures>

I brought in a vehicle in that we had purchased from the Lexus used car dealership (and had purchased a Lexus extended warranty for). I was on time for my appointment, which was for a 5,000 mile service and check engine light. By three in the afternoon I hadn't heard anything, so I called and was told it was unlikely that my car would even be looked at today. I picked up my car and will find somewhere else to get the repairs completed. They did not charge me anything, but I felt like that was a lot of time wasted.</review>

<review>The Lexus organization takes care of your needs. Drop to take a look at their best deals on their vehicles. Salesman Issa took care of us and may i say was one of the best experiences i had buying a vehicle. They will work with you and they'll also be reasonable with you. If your indecisive, just be sure to eat something before you go shop. That'll help more with your experience, but if you do not eat, they'll take care of you with some snacks. Get a Lexus.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Name>

I first met Mo on the phone, as I made a cold call looking for a used Hybrid  Lexus. I was impressed with not only his knowledge, but his  warmth and sincerity. We met at the dealership a few days later and I must say the experience far exceeded my expectations. The dealership was all class with first class snacks, coffee, etc. Also, a very cool environment on a very hot day. Mo led us through all of the ins and outs of the whole deal. carefully explaining the parameters of the vehicle itself, while making the buying experience quite painless. I would look forward to dealing with Mo and Motor City Lexus many times in the future.<//review>

Doing our regular service is a pleasure.  Getting into your vehicle to shop around at "oil and Lube" shops around town...hoping you could trust the shop to do what they advertise was a daunting task...not at our Lexus dealer...our service agent Juanita makes everything clear with a list of checked services they complete.  No doubts about the what services are rendered here. ..< /Review>

MCL went above and beyond to give me a great price of a certified pre-owned Lexus. They were incredible. Efficient, courteous, thorough, and over the top friendly. It was an easy and pleasant experience and I feel like I got more than the deal I wanted. They were terrific and have earned themselves a loyal customer!< /Review>

<Text>I appreciate the personalized attention and staying way beyond the closing time to complete my transaction.

I liked that Motor City Lexus would supplement my contract miles with additional 2500 miles at no extra charge.

The only thing missing is free regular services for the life of the lease!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The Lexus experience is fantastic. Our sales associate, Peter De Keles, was extremely knowledgeable and explained everything in detail! There is no "hard sale" pressure like other dealerships. He gave us a great deal with extras - no need for negotiating. Everyone is so nice and they even give you snacks! We went to other high-end dealerships and did not receive nearly the customer service we received at Motor City. We love our car and  being in the Lexus family. I highly recommend you see Peter at Motor City Lexus  if you are thinking of  purchasing or leasing a new car. Be sure to go there first before you go anywhere else. I guarantee when you finish looking at other vehicles, you'll drive away in a Lexus.< /Review><userid>104603054438439367784</userid>< Pics>

As a first time buyer, I felt that Issa gave me a great customer service with much professionalism. It was a really great experience buying my car with him. Not only I was able to find what I was looking for, but I also got a great deal. I loved the service and I will refer him to anyone I know that is interested in buying a car.

I'm very satisfied with the service...  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻<//text>

I have been using this dealership service department for the past 12 years! Why? Well because they are the best, they are organized, clean, and know who I am when I walk through the doors. I’m also given a new car to drive while they work on my car. My car was 11 years old and they still treated me like I bought the car yesterday. Last week I purchased my second car from this dealership, and did so because I know should I have any issues att all the service department will be there to support me and there will be zero hassles.  If you own a car and don’t want drama with repairs this is the service department for you you.<//Text>

<date>1471046268369< /date><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Our shopping experience with Steve Floyd at Motor City was the easiest , less stressful experience my husband and I have ever had . Who would have thought we would lease a vehicle online ?! In our 37 years of married life we have leased one other vehicle and purchased 8 other vehicles brand new . The process ,as I remember it , was very lengthy -- more of an ordeal . We did not experience any of that with Steve Floyd and Motor City . Because of certain circumstances and time constraints , we gave a lot of our info over the phone and using e-mail . And so when we finally sat down , the process took an hour and a half -- versus 5 hours -- or thereabouts ! We totally appreciated that !! --- And the perks with the lease deal that we got is simply amazing  ! The little sticker on our new Terrain's window allows us to receive free ding and window pits, etc. repair -- allows us to be able to store our vehicle onsite , safely , should we be traveling , 2 free car washes per month --- 2 free oil changes . Don't want to brag --- but , we are still so amazed ! Thank you Steve Floyd -- Thank you Motor City !! We are enjoying our vehicle , see you soon !<//Review>< Pictures>

Carlos Arevalo was a great salesman: no pressure, very helpful and knowledgeable.  He was patient with us as caution buyers, answered our questions and never once pressured us into making our final decision.  He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle we were looking at, presented other purchase options available, didn't offer unsolicited advice, and was attentive through the entire process-even the lengthy paperwork process.  We made several trips to the dealership before we made our purchase and Carlos remembered our purchase goals each time he worked with us.  He was definitely a salesman we enjoyed dealing with a would recommend him to others.< /review>

<text>This was our first experience with Motor City Lexus and it was one of  the best experiences we have ever had at a car dealership.  Our salesman Chris Scott was patient, courteous and friendly, never pushy. Once we were sent into the finance department we found that to also be a good experience, again explaining everything to us all the way thru.  We highly recommend Motor City Lexus they go above and beyond.

I am once again a proud owner of another new Lexus ES 350. Rob Pierce has yet again assisted me in another successful lease; a service he has helped me with on five different occasions. The experience was totally satisfying and positive. I would highly recommend him to provide his skills and services to any customer seeking a positive experience.< /Review>

Danny Smart made this buying experience sensational!  We told him exactly what we wanted in a truck and he went to work getting us exactly what we wanted and more!  He was super fun to work with and made the whole deal happen so FAST!  To boot....he delivered our new truck to our work and we didn't have to take time off to go finish business....and he drove our trade in back to GMC!  Awesome customer service!!!!!</Review>

The entire experience of purchasing a new truck was outstanding. The salesperson, Omar, was a pleasure to work with and he was very accommodating and pressure free. Everyone there was very friendly and I know I will enjoy interacting with them in the future!</text>

Our salesman Nick Vallejo was exceptionally helpful in listening to what our requirements were. He took the time to explain what options were available to us and answered all our questions. We both believed Nick was more interested in helping us find the car we require than just making a sale.<//Text>

<text>They were very accommodating when I called in to have my RX do a recall service. Flexible when I wasnt able to return the rental on the same day as long as I return it before 8am which was OK with me. I reccomend to have their Lexus serviced by this location. I’m surely will come back for future services done to my RX.</text><name>Jowell Protasio< /name>< pics>

I had a very positive experience recently while leasing a new vehicle from Motor City (GMC). Kevin and all the staff I worked with were very professional: knowledgeable, patient, and helpful throughout the entire process. They helped me find the best vehicle and finance options to fit my needs. The environment was comfortable and clean. I highly recommend this dealership.< /text>

<Review>I feel like I've experienced the worst of the worse during my entire car-buying experience. I hated looking for a car until I met Ali and Rocky at Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield. I am a female and a first-time buyer, who shopped alone so you could imagine what kind of sharks other salesmen were, but, not Ali and Rocky. They made sure I felt comfortable, answered any questions I had, allowed me to comfortably test drive a car I wanted, and weren't pushy about having to buy then and there. The best part about my experience was that when I was ready to buy, they made sure it was quick and easy. I am definitely recommending them to all of my friends! They are good people who genuinely look out for their clients' best interest. I am so lucky to have met these guys!<//Review>< Pics>

Leaving Las Vegas to San Francisco a little fly seemed to bother my passengers to the point of panic.  The window jammed, but we were able to get it up.  In Bakersfield, my daughter's little toes "accidentally" opened the window and we couldn't get it back up.  Talk about customer service!  Half an hour after the mechanics usually leave, the team (Aris,  Juanita, Janet and Mike) mobilized to get the window up so we could continue our journey safely with 3 children in 110 degree heat.  Thank you Motor City Lexus for your amazingly kind people!<//text>

Our recent purchase of Lexus RX 350 was probably the best car purchase we have had in our lifetime. Demian Castillo was our salesman and we can't say enough good about him. He made our buying experience a true pleasure. We hope he goes far with your company.  Richard was also a great help.  Chad from technical product was also wonderful.
Thanks again for the experience, we are enjoying our car.

Sincerely,
Paul & Indriani Carroll</Review>

Demian Castillo  was incredibly knowledgeable and accommodating. My husband and I asked him to research various color interior/exterior color combinations and he surely did his research.  By the time we made our appointment to buy, he had a fully loaded car washed and prepped for our test drive.  We actually were presented with such a great deal on that car we test drove that we decided to purchase that same day.  Our experience was phenomenal,  we never felt pressured to buy.  We leased our new Lexus IS 350 and couldn't be happier. It handles beautifully and comes fully loaded.  We traded our old vehicle and were given fair market value.

Thank you very much Damian for your efforts in going above and beyond for us and also  extend our deep gratitude to the Lexus Team for making our shopping experience a memorable one.

Truly Grateful,

Elvi Solis and Frank Espinoza<//Text>

Demian provided me with excellent customer service. He was not pushy on the sell. He customized the vehicle choices to fit my financial needs, while still putting me in the vehicle of my choice. He was patient as this was not my first time in browsing, accommodated my desire to continue to browse. When it came to signing he accomplished a smooth transaction. I felt comfortable and excited with this big purchase and commitment. 100% sure I can trust Demian as my representative and I would recommend him to any of my friends and family members. As far a the car, 2016 Lexus IS 200t, that's a no brainier 😍 smooth ride with red leather interior and exterior luxury look.<//Review>

<text>My experience with the Motor City Staff felt personalized and the service provided definitely exceeeded my expectations. Everyone was so polite, friendly, and welcoming.

I drove a great distance to pick-up my new vehicle and Issa waited patiently for me to arrive... Issa even called the next day to ensure that I made it home safely, which was very kind of him....

But, Tim made it all happen. When I arrived, my new vehicle was ready and all I had to do was sign for it!!! Tim answered all of my questions and worked out a good deal for my trade-in.

Also, I was the last customer of the day and I know the team wanted to go home, but it didn’t dimenish the quality of service they extended to me. Natalie in the Finance Department was a pleasure to interact with... Lastly, I was escorted to my vehicle and the young man (forgot his name) took his time to explain the vehicle features. He was very nice, professional, and enthusiastic!!!

I would definitely recommend this dealership to my friends.... The whole experience was topnotch!!!!</text>< Date>

I’ve had a trying week dealing with the Motor City Dealership. I was just about done with the whole place when I called my wonderful sales guy, Faraz Ahmed and he truly made everything better!

I’ve told everyone that would listen (social media “friends” included) about how awesome Motor City is, so I was heartbroken to have been treated poorly by one particular individual.  I felt horribly having to involve Faraz but he’s been so helpful and kept his end of the bargain with my little questions here and there, so naturally he was the only one I felt comfortable dealing with.

Long story short, he did everything in his power to make sure that I was treated fairly and that I walked out of that dealership happy as a clam!
He got me to John Barajas who was just as helpful, and voila💥 it worked!

I will continue to do business with this dealership because anyone who can make me change my mind deserves my loyalty!</text>

<text>I would like to commend Service Advisor Sean for fitting me into his busy schedule on a Monday morning even though I didn't have an appt. He was very professional and freindly and didn't make me feel like an inconvience even though I knew I had to be. The world needs more people like Sean.

This has got to be the best experience I have ever had purchasing a car...new or used. My salesman, Jason, was the ultimate professional - courteous, knowledgeable, and personable. There is no doubt my next car will be another Lexus...and there is no doubt I will be contacting Jason when I do.</text>

I have had several issues with the service department at this dealership over consecutive visits.  There has been miscommunication and wrongly stated information given to me.  The service people have been very friendly to me, but there has been some lack of accuracy here and there.  For instance, during my last visit, I was told by the receptionist that there was no loaner car waiting for me, even though an appointment had previously (three days in advance) been made for a loaner car.  The information that the receptionists gave to me turned out not to be true.  The receptionist had found that there was a car waiting for me but failed, then, to tell me, so I had to Uber home, and then back again to pick up my car.  Secondly, during this same visit, I was told that my RX350 needed one shock absorber in the front replaced, and one in the back replaced.  However, my paperwork said that two rear shocks were replaced.  So I'm left wondering if there was miscommunication between the service advisor and the service tech, or if the service tech simply ended up replacing a wrong rear shock absorber. The pricing of work is also higher than more typical auto-repair places.  Since I concurrently had been having one of my other cars serviced at a different auto-repair shop, I took my completed Lexus paperwork to this well-known auto repair to see what they could have done two of my same repairs for, and they said it would have been $310.00 less had I had them do the work.  It is well-known that dealers charge more for work, but this is a very large difference. I also had a cut in my upholstery repaired on my passenger rear interior door.  All that I can say is that it is repaired, yes, but it doesn’t look great.  It is a bit bubbly/non-smooth.  I would have thought that a Lexus dealership would have supervised a higher quality of repair on it, even knowing that they out-source the work. Lastly, and to me, most significantly, since I had already met with the service manager and the general manager of this dealership explaining some of these problems to both of them in their office, I am disappointed by the fact that once I brought my vehicle home, I tried calling my service advisor on the shock absorber issue at 2:00pm the same day (July 18, 2018), and never received a call back.  I then called the following morniing at 9:00am, reached her, but she said she was busy with clients in her office and would call me back in a few minutes, which did not happen.  I have decided that as of today, with the exception of any future recalls that come out and have to be repaired, I will not take any of my vehicles back to this or any Lexus dealer for any servicing.  There is just something not "clicking" with them over there for me.</Text>

<Text>My first experience at Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield was comparable to the luxurious car I bought. From the first greeting until I drove away, I was given excellent service by Demian Castillo, my salesperson, and everyone else I encountered there. Demian was very personable and easy-going, helping me as though I had been going there for years. I felt I was respected as a person and not just a car buyer. If any of my family or friends are interested in buying a Lexus, I will not hesitate to recommend Motor City Lexus.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2<//gmap_id>< user_id>

<review>The salesman Chris Arnold did a fantastic job. He met my expectations and provided a wealth of knowledge for my consideration for a purchase.  My disappointment was with the finishing department that checks the fluids and details the vehicle for customer delivery. after 1 hour my vehicle had not even been started. They said they were unaware the vehicle had been sold when I saw Chris provide the tag and keys to a vehicle runner who drove it back to the prep site. I had o bring the vehicle back to have it finalized. Unbelievable!!!!!!!!!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I would like to truly thank Rocky Tayeh for an amazing experience when purchasing our car at Motor City Lexus. My husband and I stopped by unannounced, on a super hot Saturday, iand Rocky treated us like family from the start. The entire experience, from beginning to end, of buying a Lexus at Motor City Lexus was undoubtedly the best we have ever had. I will continue to spread the word about how wonderful Rocky was, and how friendly the entire staff was. I am looking forward to many years in my new car, thanks again for everything!< /Text>< user_id>

I just bought a beautiful GMC Canyon from Motor City and I couldn't be happier with my purchase or the experience my wife and I had with Danny Smart. In my opinion Danny is a true professional with years of experience and it really shows when you work with him. He made sure we got every incentive possible and that we were happy with our purchase. I will recommend Danny to all who ask without reservation.  Thanks again Danny and Motor City GMC.</review>

This was my 3/rd new GMC 1500 Sierra 4x4 in 5yrs., all purchased from Motor City. The reason I keep coming back is because of Jorge Espreza, Joe Busby and the excellent, courteous, knowledge, and deals that I have received in the past and present. They have gone beyond my expectations in the professional attitude that they emulate. Also, when it comes to service, they are 5* in my opinion. They are by far the best dealership in California and probably this side of the Ole Miss River.< /review>

I never felt pressure to buy. Faraz is definitely someone that I would highly  recommend if you're in the market to purchase a new Lexus.
I also worked with Richard in the finance department.  He also exceeded my expectations. Richard was so kind and explained everything in a way I could understand.  When signing the final papers I worked with Shelley. She too was very pleasant.
I would highly  recommend Motor City Lexus. They are  knowledgeable people that take their time to make sure you are happy!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I moved to town about a month ago and needed to buy a car sort of quickly. When I told this to Faraz at Motor City, he went above and beyond to help me get into a great car at a great price. He worked closely with me to find out my price range and the kind of things I was looking for. His recommendations were spot on and I couldn't be happier with my Certified Pre-Owned CT200H F Sport. Would highly recommend anyone looking to get a car go to Motor City Lexus and ask for Faraz!< /Review>< user_name>

Motor City Lexus provides great service. And has a waiting area with all the Comforts of home. Unlike other service dealers Lexus schedules their service appointments well, so the waiting area is rarely crowded. For waiting customers they provide free Starbucks coffees, snacks, waster, and soda. The waiting areas are homey comfortable; and provide free Wi-Fi as well as recliners and Tv. You can comfortably work while you weight, or recline and take a nap. Most important the service is timely, and the staff appear to be happy and enjoy their jobs. They are courteous and responsible. They have often saved us money by telling us when repairs we assumed were necessary, were actually not needed. Keep up the good work Team Lexus. We are loyal customers.</Review>

I am enjoying my new-to-me 2012 GMC Acadia.  Thanks to the efforts of Chris and Brett, all issues were quickly resolved and I drove away today a happy camper.  Brett started the process by locating the vehicle and then texting me to set up a test drive.  Since he was off duty when I arrived, he had arranged for Chris to follow up with me.  Chris listened to all of my concerns, spoke with his manager and came up with a wonderful solution.  We signed the paperwork on a Wednesday evening, and both Brett and Chris followed up via text to let me know it was ready on Friday.  I took delivery on Saturday and am very pleased with my new car...thanks gentlemen for a great job, very professional, friendly and respectful.</text>

<Review>starFor the first time ever I bought my Lexus with Motor City Lexus of Bakersfield. We have always bought our cars in the Bay Area. From the very moment we met Joey Buoni from Lexus I knew we would be buying a car from him. He was not your typical car salesman. He was not pushy, listened to all of our needs, knew all about the cars. he was kind and very patient. I decided on what color I wanted, the type etc. Joey searched for me and in just a few days I was back at the dealer buying my new RX. Joey even came in on his day off. During the entire process from meeting the Director of Sales Ali Douglas who really worked with us on the price we wanted to pay, to the Finance Manager Sergio Martinez (my husband shared Army stories with him, oh my) to our Technology specialist Parker Christian everyone was wonderful to work with. We will be back! Thank you to the entire team for making buying a car actually fun and not painful! Colleen Bauer proud owner of a brand new Lexus RX.<//Review>< time>

Easily the best dealership I've ever dealt with in regards to getting a car lease.  I've gotten over 10 leases in the past and dealing with Joey Buoni made life so easy.  From the first phone call in negotiating (if you even call it that) my deal to the day the car was delivered to my doorstep (I live in Las Vegas), every step was so naturally simple.  Just hoping that Joey is around when this lease expires so I can go through Motor City again for my next lease.< /Review>

<Review>It was so easy. I didnt feel pressured and we were able to test drive several cars before we decided. We wanted to make sure we had weighed all our options before making a decision and they were so patient with us. Our sales rep was very easy to work with and she worked up the numbers for several different deal options for us to choose from so we could pick the one that best fit our situation and comfort level with down payment and with monthly payments. Ive bought a lot of cars in my life and this was by far the smoothest and easiest process Ive been through. The entire staff made us feel comfortable and they gave us an extremely fair deal on our trade compared to other offers we had from other dealers. We couldnt be happier with our experience and most importantly our new car.<//Review>< Pictures>

I took it back to motor city lexus Bakersfield they told me it was the top engine needed cleaning so here i go again paid  $900 service technician told me it will take roughly 10,000 miles to make VSC on again I got the car back I was only driving it for 200 miles and VSC was on again! I talked to their service manager he said it needed a total engine cleaning inside he just wanted me to pay a rough estimate $5,788 or could be more.. He also told me to trade-in my car for another lexus  I said no way how can I trust lexus car and service department? I ALWAYS put supreme gas and up to date on change oils so go figure...these people trying to make a lot of money out of me but no work or service is done..

When we left there it was back to the drawing board and that is when I found Demian and motor city Lexus. We have owned over 30+ cars and this was hands down the best experience by far! We live in Orange County and drove out there this morning ( 130 miles away and passed probably 10 other Lexus dealers on the way ) and picked up the car.  Demian and I ironed out all the numbers last night via text and as promised we were in and out in less than 90 minutes this Morning. Everyone there was very appreciative of our business and still very respectful of our time crunch and needing to get back on the road.  He took my request to get done fast seriously and made sure we had time to make it back to oc and pick up grandma on time from the airport. He made sure to put new batteries in both remotes , leather covers on them, key chains and a few Lexus mugs for my wife and I.  He was very thorough and not pushy at all.  This dealership is awesome and Demian is a perfect example of a car sales man who gets it.  I will never buy a Lexus anywhere else ever again.  I only wish they were closer to my house so I could use their service department.  Our deal was so smooth,  super easy and showed me that their are some car dealers that still value their customers.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Great Experience, Carlos Valdes was patient and took care of our needs. We were going back and forth between the GMC Denali Acadia and the Ford Explorer Sport for 6 months and Carlos stuck with us. Even through our drama in picking between the two vehicles, Carlos stuck to his word in getting us the best price he possibly could to meet our budget.< /text>

On  May 28th I call motor city Lexus to schedule a appointment for a  fuel injectors clean with  Ange service advisor.  When  my wife arrived at 8am June 2nd 2018 for the appointment Angel was off and she had to talk to Bruce. Bruce wrote the car for her and told my wife she was getting a loaner that the service would be done in two and a half hours so by 11:00am.
I called Bruce to find out why he had.not call us to pick the car up. His reply was when you take a loaner you get put back until the end of the day which he never explained to my wife . We started arguing and he started to raise his voice at me and that conversation didn’t end well. We had to be in Los Angeles by 4:00pm I told that we would have take the loaner and bring it back on Monday morning. He told I was going to be charged $90dlls per for his mistake Bruce response was well We have no service the car if you want it like that you can come and pick it up that was his resolution to the problem. So drove to the dealer and ask for someone in management Jake came over to assist me nice guy.  I told  Jake about the situation and said take the loaner I will eat the cost off the rental for the inconvenience this was at 1325pm.
I left home It was really strange that the vehicle was not in service while I was there at the dealership but within 45 minutes of me leaving the dealership bruce calls me to tell me that was ready. I question Bruce that it only took 45 minutes to service my car when he said it was two hours and a half I strongly believe that nothing was done to my vehicle. That I paid for something that was rushed or not done at all.
I have left a message for the service manager to give me a call his name is Ray which I had to call him for days later and leave a message reminding him to call me back whe n  Ray call me back  Ray said I thought it was taken care already. I explain to Ray the situation and he said that he wanted my to bring the car back so they can take it apart and show me it was done properly. Any guy that knows about cars knows that the throttle body could have been clean but how can they prove to me they service the injectors.
Mr. John Petri I have already lost 5 hours of work on this past Monday the fourth because I had to go back to the dealership to pick up my car because the work was not done  on Saturday the 2nd.
To anyone that reads this review be careful when you take your car to be serviced at Motor City Lexus they cover for their employees mistakes. I believe I should get refunded for the amount I paid for 45 minute service after I complain.<//Text>

What a fantastic car buying experience! Jaber knew what our needs were, and found a car that fit those needs.    Always optimistic and trustworthy, Jaber made our experience painless, and we are so happy with our purchase.  Nora was fun and accommodating.   The whole team actually made buying a car a positive experience.  Motor City went above and beyond for our family.  Thank you, Jaber and Nora!<//text>

So far I am more then satisfied with my Terrain.

<Review>Demian has been absolutely fantastic! I purchased a 2014 GX460 from him. I live in Denver and this was the 1st time I purchased a car out of state. Demian has walked me through the entire process, he has had excellent communication and provided A+ customer service. I will definitely consider your dealership if I ever need another Lexus. Great job Demian and Team!< /Review>< pictures>

Traveling from Washington, never a good thing when your away from home and buy a car private party and hit freeway and it's shutting off at 60 with our kids in vehicle. Called bakersfield motor city lexus and said we were on freeway 20 mins away. They didn't even question getting us in for a diagnostic. Tony was nothing but a  professional service man. Provided us the most kind service we have seen in a long time. And Juan was an awesome polite service guy. Figured out our problem immediately got us back on road to home stretch. We will definitely always recommend this motor city lexus. Thank you guys again. Kindness and professionalism goes along way.</Text>

<Review>Jorge Oropeza was a great person to work with while purchasing our new LaCrosse.  He provided all of the information needed to make our decision yet allowed us the opportunity to talk and explore the vehicles we were considering without feeling pressured or always at our side.  This allowed us to talk it over frelly while making our decision.  He also allowed us ample opportunity to test drive each vehicle without feeling rushed.  This kind of service and treatment, as well as the fantastic service we get in the service department is why we keep coming back to Motor City to purchase our new vehicles.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I had received the recall notice from Lexus, about the airbag situation with Takata.

I had only bought my used 2011 ES 350, a car I truly loved. Best I had ever owned... on 7/20/16. It was less than a year, I had owned it. My options given to me by corporate,  we're a rental (far cheaper quality) for minimum 6 months, or no one can ride in my passenger seat, until a fix is available. Maybe January of next year.

I went to my Lexus dealer, I bought the car from. I had a wonderful experience the first time. The Service Manager dealt with me personally, he brought the Sales Manager into it. Between them, they offered to make it right, if I wanted to trade the car in. A car, none of us could really do anything with.

That's when Rocky Tayeh, an Assistant Sales Manager entered the picture. He was asked if he could help me pick out something special, and they would try to make things right.

Rocky and I talked for a few minutes, while we walked to the cars. By the time we reached the lot, he knew which car he thought I might like. We end up at the same color, 2015 ES 350, updated model of my car. Obviously, very updated since 2011.

I looked at the price and Rocky noticed me cringe a bit. It was a L-Certified loaner car. Listed at a premium price. Rocky said, not to worry about that, they were gong to take care of me.

We went inside to talk a deal. I asked for a few concessions, he went to talk to the Sales Manager and they came back, with a deal... better than I asked for. They not only gave me full trade-in value for my old car, which they have to sit on, at least 6 months. They even added some to its value. They offered me the car at a price attractively below, what it was listed for. They offered me a finance rate, lower than I could get, if I borrowed the money from myself , through the credit union.

Just a very nice deal, on a great car... with zero haggling! Every question I had, Rocky had an answer, or he got one. He hooked me up with the Finance Manager, who had all the details, and we breezed through the paperwork. He was very clear, and I understood, everything... no behind the back, hidden fees. Heck, they took care of some of the fees I would normally have had to pay.

I saved thousands of dollars on a very nice Lexus. Thanks in large part to Rocky Tayeh. He's easy going, very respectful, and listens to people. I would most certainly buy a car from him again. Some day, I might. I consider Motor City Lexus, my car dealership. I always have a pleasant experience when I go there, with honest, friendly people. Best car dealership I've ever done business with. They always make you feel welcome.<//Text>

Thanks again for helping us get our car and giving us an awesome deal. You were extremely patient and professional, and you didn't make us feel pressured or rushed.

We'll definitely recommend you to our friends and/or family looking to get a new car.

Thanks again,

We knew we wanted a GMC Sierra after looking at other models.  We met Ryan Benak months ago at Motor City GMC.  When the time for our purchase was right, we re-contacted him to assist us with finding the truck of our dreams!  He was able to locate one that fit our specifications and guided us through the process.

We appreciate his personal attention, professionalism, and genuine interest in our business.  Thank you !< /Review>

<review>Everything about this operation tells you that it is well-run.   Employees from salesperson to car-get-ready person are friendly, efficient and informative.

Our salesman, Sami Ayoub was no exception.  He had an astonishing ability to figure out exactly what we needed and to communicate important information about GMC trucks quickly and precisely.  He never pushed us in a direction we did not what go.  His answers to our questions always went straight to the heart of the matter.  Best experience we've had in 50 years of buying cars.  Wow!<//review>< Name>

Our experience purchasing our new Buick Encore 2016 was EXCELLENT !!!!
For the 2nd time buying a new car with them, specially with Jorge Oropeza, the sales specialist, would do whatever you need to make you comfortable during the process of purchasing !!!
Congratulations to Jorge, he is the best 👏👏<//Text>

I come to GMC to trade in my car which I was thinking of getting a truck, however a week before I got my truck I went to Toyota and they told me I could not trade in my car due to my car was upside down. so when I went to Motor City I thought they were going to tell me the same thing. but Motor city really help me make it happen! they did everything and I ended up getting a brand new GMC truck. the person who help me was Jury Jimenez he did everything possible and got the job done of taking my car and getting me into a new truck Thank You!!< /review>

<pics>None<//pics><Rate>5<//Rate><name>Pamela Dobrenen<//name><review>I can say, without reservation, that my recent car leasing experience at Bakersfield's Motor Ciry Lexus was the most comfortable, professional, and stress-free dealership encounter I have ever had. My product specialist, Faraz Ahmed, seemed genuinely concerned that I receive exactly what I desired in my new vehicle. I honestly feel that I could have walked away at any point and not have been pressured or stalked as in other encounters with car salesmen in the past....this is a big factor in why I stayed and continued to pursue a car here. The positive experience continued with the finance dept. The process was paperless with all forms signed on a tabletop touchscreen and, once again, relaxed, cordial, and stress-free. I left with the assurance I would have ongoing support from the dealership throughout the time I have this vehicle, a Lexus NX 200t. As a final note, a former customer of Mr. Ahmed came by while we were discussing some details regarding the car and mentioned that he was looking for a new vehicle and asked Faraz to keep an eye out for him. Repeat customer who was obviously very pleased with the ongoing service he had received from this specialist. Sounds like a good sign to me. Do not hesitate to buy or lease a car from Motor City. They are customer-focused and have a well-conceived marketing strategy that truly fits today's consumer. Thanks for an outstanding experience.</review><Time>1473254299994<//Time><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80ea6a9868f999ff:0x5815f25a041f5ef2</gmapID>< user_id>

I was referred to your dealership, and to Mr. Chris Arnold, one of your sales staff, by a friend.  In addition, my son had purchased a 2014 GMC Sierra truck and he has really enjoyed it.  Wanting to do some preparation prior to my first visit to your  business, I began speaking with owners of GMC trucks everywhere I encountered them, to find out how well they liked their trucks.  I found one gentleman who is on his 4th GMC truck and he raved about it, and that helped me decide that I really wanted a new Sierra.  I was treated very well by Mr. Arnold and he patiently helped me while I decided just what I wanted.  The  whole purchasing experience was low pressure, informative and cordial.< /Review>

I highly recommend GMC Motor City for your next vehicle purchase  I also highly recommend you ask for Sami Ayoub. Sami works extremely hard at finding you the best deal.  In my opinion,  he goes above and beyond any other car salesman that I have ever dealt with.<//Text>

I recently went in to buy a 2016 GMC Canyon diesel 4x4 and I was greeted by Omar and we promptly went on a test drive as usual but during the test drive I realized very quickly that this was going to be alot easier than I had planned (so i pummed my self up in the mirror at home for nothing).  I was told by Omar that we will talk pricing and that there would be no pressure and he was not lying.  The selection was good and everything I wanted was there and redy to roll.  The process was quick and simple and I was in and out in about 1 1/2 with friendly low pressure service in a very clean environment with the truck ive been waiting years for and a price I couldnt beat.
Very happy with this place</review>

My experience with Motor City GMC was nothing short of Excellent !
Seeing that this review will be available to anyone online, I'd like say first that I'm a retired person, up in the years and along with that comes years of experiences. I've bought several cars & trucks throughout the years from many different dealers and salespeople. Motor City GMC has raised the bar of excellent customer service and there's no doubt in my mind, that the reason they've been able to do that, is because of my salesperson Sami Ayoub. Not only is Sami the customers best advocate in getting a great deal on a new vehicle, he quickly and easily helped me  through understanding the operations of the many advanced systems available on GMC trucks today. Great dealership EXCELLENT SALESMAN!< /Review>

Mark Musleh was the sales associate who walked me through the purchase of my beautiful 2016 Buick LaCrosse.  Mark was a pleasure to work with as he was quite patient and knowledgable, and he answered my questions and concerns thoroughly.  All staff I encountered in my experiece at Motor City Buick, GMC, Lexus added to the value this company works to share with their patrons.</Review>

<Review>I had an amazing experience, Hedi help is over the phone and was very sweet and knowledgeable about the different car packages available. This is actually the 4th dealership I called before anyone sounded like they knew What they were taking about. We did find a Suv we were interested in and Analisa was the one who assisted us when we visited the dealership. We did end up buying the car and everyone was very professional and made the experience amazing. There was a Manager named Ali who walked by and introduced him self, and was very kind. This isn't my first time at a dealership and usually managers walk by without even looking at a customer. Analisa made sure we were happy during our stay and went out of her way to get us anything we asked for. I look forward to doing business with this Lexus dealership just because of how nice the staff were. Thank you for my New GX 460.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I have always owned vehicles made by Volvo, BMW and Honda.  In 1998, I bought my first American made vehicle, a GMC 1500 extended cab truck. I bought this from Motor City GMC, then at that time located on Union Avenue.  Since then I have purchased  4 trucks and 4 Suburbans / Yukon XLs.

The transactions have always been similar.  A bottom line price is presented to me and I have always accepted the price, which is for most part much lower than sticker.  Mr. Stricklen has always taken good care of me and certainly look forward to purchasing another vehicle from Motor City GMC in the future.</Review>

I found the Lexus dealership in Bakersfield to be very professional, friendly and relaxed.  I was not approached by a salesperson in an aggressive manner like I have experienced in other car sale situations.  It was definitely a very easy-going manner in which the receptionist first approached me and asked if I would like to speak with someone regarding any of the cars.  I first spoke with Heidi who let me discover all the wonderful aspects of the Lexus GX and LX and answered any questions I had.  When I came on a second day I spoke with Marsella, who was very knowledgeable, honest , and very friendly.  On the third day I visited the dealership, I spoke with Sergio, who was equally as wonderful as the other two sales people that I had met with previously.  I appreciated the fact that if he did not know the answer to a question, he admitted that and found the answer immediately.  He was very professional and kind.   I must mention also that Jashan  also was wonderful and very informative as he helped  me to review and sign the sale contract.  He is a great asset to the team there at Lexus because he has a very kind, assuring, and honest manner about him.<//Text>

< Review>
I've been to a lot of dealerships and I have had some pretty bad experiences, but when we arrived at motor city we had a great deal stress due to car problems and not wanting to have to spend more money to fix a car that wasn't going to last another year, but after one hour at motor city we were able to de-stress , and the staff made it easy on us, we found the car we wanted and that took care of everything, we drove away very happy , I recommend motor city to anyone looking for transportation, Thanks so much folks, and God bless you all.<//Review>
