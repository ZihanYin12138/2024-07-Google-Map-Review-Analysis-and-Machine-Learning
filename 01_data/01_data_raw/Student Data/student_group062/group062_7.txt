Not a gym location I would call home. Was already met with judgemental eyes at customer service desk. The vibe is awful and unwelcoming. Also this place is extremely up tight and I don't appreciate the mask reminders on the pa system while working out. For one thats ahuge liability for gyms to enforce this non unconstitutional law that is in violation of A. D. A Title II of th American Republic Constitution. Now other gyms I've been to don't enforce this as much because its common sense that one can die! Also these businesses are in violation of their contracts to open to the public but discriminate against people with disabilities. That results in a fine of 50,000. Now if I ever go back here and they discriminate against federal law then I will be filing suit. Go to other locations and don't waste your time here. Nothing but rude people.< /text>

<user>104178660489410241723< /user><Text>I'm giving this place two stars because it's affordable and has decent facilities. But the culture and environment, specifically in the evening hours, is absolutely horrendous. There's a clique of patrons that will regularly occupy equipment and hold them hostage for almost hours at a time, using it for one small set then wasting the rest of the time with idle conversation. I've been going here for a little over 3 months and I absolutely hate trying to get in a day with squats during the week because this is the typical story. The place has three platforms and a squat rack, all four were occupied and I had to patiently wait for one to open up. One was hosting a conversation that literally went on for 15 minutes without the barbell even being touched (and at one point they decided to walk off and talk to other people in the gym), another was hosting conversations that lasted 5 minutes at a time. I waited for HALF AN HOUR for one of the four stations to open up simply to stand around twiddling my thumbs. It was then after almost 45 minutes of waiting, that I decided that squats weren't on the regiment for the day. So long story short, if you thinking about joining and your only available time is in the evenings then you're better of spending your money on a membership elsewhere. This story is far to typical with the time I've spent here and I'm very much considering cancelling and finding something else.<//Text>< GmapID>

< Review>
Pretty disappointed with the customer service experience at the front desk. Although I live in Canada, I'm in the process of moving to SD for work and decided to try Crunch while here in San Diego for a few days. I asked if I could have a tour and asked if they provided a day pass to try out the facility while explaining my situation and the girl at the front said without hesitation "if you're not a resident it's $10". I said ok, no problem and paid. The conversation ended there. I had no idea about the gym, their offerings and even had to ask where the locker rooms were. I'm in the gym 5-6 times a week so it's important to me to be in a place I can call home but I won't be returning to a business that made me feel so dismissed. Gym is quite good, good size, good and clean equipment. Do better with people, you guys!< /Review>

Honestly it has been my favorite gym to go to since I've lived in San Diego(for 6 months) . I've been to a couple other gyms (such as LA fit, Chuze, 24hour), but honestly there's something about crunch! Great team members at the front! They're very approachable! The personal trainers are also very knowledgable and really do help the guests with any questions about fitness! There are many positive gym goers as well! Would highly recommend to at least try for one day and see how it is!</review>

<Review>Crunch is a good decent gym, has olympic plates to train. With decent machines and weights, restrooms are clean and so is the gym in general. Staff is friendly, Theres one fit hot girl at the front too. Has tanning for those who care and hydromassage. Also the price is 10dlls a month. Cheapest gym out there.                                                The problems are : one the parking lot! Since its on a mall finding parking is hell, then people tend to hang out on the bench press and squat racks forever!                                                      One time some high school kids (3) were at the bench for over 35 mins, I went on my routine and kept looking and they just hang in there, I ask them how much they had left, one said a couple reps and still waited for another 10 mins. This was every time I did chest,  always waiting on it for 20mins, 25mins , 15 mins since theres only 2 flat benches. Sometimes they use multiple machines and just leave their stuff there. I just switch gyms before I ended  up beating those type of kids<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

WHAT A GREAT PLACE
What I love about them is they will let you know what is important to fix and what can wait. Very professional and updates you with all their findings and the cost.

THANK YOU
YOU ARE AWESOME<//Text>

I recently purchased a car from a private seller and had to do a smog due to the title transfer even though the car reg was renewed through next year... (DMV and their nefarious protocol)... Discovered this little gem from AAA agent who recommended them. Went there hoping for same day service. Received quick, friendly, and quality service. Definitely recommend.<//Text>

<Text>Went in there for the first time for an oil change. While I was in the waiting room I overheard the owner on the phone with a customer. He went over what they found that car needed and explained why AND went over what they found that did NOT need attention and why. I never heard that before, anywhere. When my truck was ready, same conversation about what they found was needed and what was not needed, such as not needed were disc break pads, air filter and tires. The oil change was cheaper than the dealership. I saw the clean, orderly shop area and was very impressed. Going in there I knew I needed a new timing chain. The quote was almost half that of the dealer. I scheduled an appointment for the next week. Great original art on the office walls, done by the owner's father. Those alone are worth the trip in to see them. I WILL be back.<//Text>< UserId.>

When I had a bisiness trip in Escondido, I decided to buy several parts for my Cayenne and go back to Korea because I should wait long time to get the parts if I order in Seoul. Even though I had limited time in Escondido, Mitch made it within 24 hours asking many dealers to get the parts in time.
And what's interesting is that he can speak Chinese very fluently haha< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Mitch, Efren and the rest of the team at 5th Ave Auto Service run a first class operation and deserve every one of the 5 star reviews they have! Since I found them I have not gone to any other mechanic. They service all of my vehicles including my MINI which is highly modified and scares most mechanics into either not working on it or charging me an exurbanite rate to scare me away. 5th Ave Auto Service do anything and everything your car might need and they do it in the cleanest shop I have ever seen. Now fixing cars is one thing but customer service is another and as someone who wants to know exactly what is going on and why, I ask a lot of questions and Mitch and Efren have always taken their time to hear me out and answer all my questions. This type of service is very hard to come by nowadays.</Review>

<review>Initiated through Yelp to get quote. Mitch was the first one to respond. I was very impressed with the reviews.

Mitch was very prompt with my question and even gave me same day 4:30 appointment.
I am here to change my break pads. But Mitch was great and made me feel home and gave a wonderful tour.  I changed two rear pads and I am due for the front wheel pads change.

This place is a blast. This is as all in one garage solution. One suggestion, since he have lot of place, he should rent out this place for individuals who like to work on their car.

Highlights:
Bajaj Chetak, Out door spots for bigger trucks, Server and Nerwork room, Kitchen for Staff, Conference room while you wait, Two level garage, Huge garage, Vintage Cars, Fancy Cars, Wait room with TV and Pet Projects

I will update more during my second visit.<//review>< pics>

<review>I placed a phone order at 5p to be ready by 6p. it wasnt ready when I got there at 6p- didnt get it until 620p. Only positive thing was the manager was kind about my complaint and didnt get frustrated back at me like his employee did. Not very good time management on Fridays.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Long wait times, pizza not cut completely, and bad very bad service !!! I have seen workers in the back dancing while there were customers waiting to be helped including me. Never will i go back to this location i would rather go to the one by food 4 less they know how to attened to their customers and they go to work not to mess around and have you waiting. And some of the females wear thin clothing that shows their underwear.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80940c68f8a59ecf:0x3f1e4465d2a4a925<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>Called in an order before we got into town, had to repeat te order 3 times for 2 large stuffed crust pepperoni pizzas. Estimated time for pickup from 20- 55 minutes. Just... lacking customer service skills, and a sense of time to make a pizza.
But the pizza was good after we got it.</text>< userid>

<Review>It's not 5 star dining I get that. But this is the only place I been to that sells a hot and ready for $6+ when everywhere else sells it for $5. Then I went 30 minutes before closing and they said they weren't gonna make the pizza I wanted because they didn't wanna have to clean the pans again.</Review>< pictures>

Poor employer hygiene,   they don't wear gloves while cooking, they touch there faces, hair, ect, and go back to cooking.  I saw an employee with her shirt backwards, eating around the restaurant and  around the  food. Also saw a roach on the counter.< /Text>

I thought that was supposed to be why they're called hot and Ready's cuz they're ready. Too many little kids working there they need to bring in some adults so things can run  much smoother< /text>< user>

The staff just kinda sucks, but theres also alot of those annoying rude customers at this little ceasars which is why it might be they they have bad customer service but I'm not justifying them. Everything I come here the pizza is hard and stale and the crazy bread is not the same as before. I think the little ceasars on Cleveland is better</review>

The pizza dough was raw, but they made it right by giving me another deep dish pizza no charge and a free order of wings. I love the pizza but this was an inconvenience.<//Review>

<text>It's been an honor to work with Sunburst over the last couple years! Our involvement with their program has brought us more insight and gratitude than we could have imagined.

Taking part in their special events is a powerful experience and we highly recommend getting involved. Whether you become a Cadet or just support their cause -- Sunburst is the Real Deal -- passionate and influential in their approach.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxw95qRlx-b9-HR_JAHHUODUS18ps52_bbQATu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd2efa7739615d:0x3f81cbac6808fd7< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

In my experience: I had all my hopes on this program I really believe in them, but in results is a total disappointment, fist they make it almost impossible with all the requirements in the application and they continue to ask for more as you turn everything, they give you rules of what's going to happen if you son or daughter gets kicked out but they don't apply them to all (favoritism or just fed up with drama of teens) they say that $140 will be use for an emergency to send you child home if no one can pick it up buy yet when that happens they force you to come get your child immediately (I live 2 hours away and they knew it)  and don't want to use the money for it, then the explanation of the reasons why is he or she getting kicked out is your child don't want to comply with discipline. What is this program for then ???? If we're applying for it is for that reason !!!!!(single mom)  Not because I have a good child . But of course they get pay like $25,000 per child that get in so ones is in they just don't want to deal with the challenges ones and keep the easy ones, that's my best conclusions. The program is hands off no meter what, but yet my son gets punched in the face and the kid didn't get suspended wish that's is the most delicate reasons to get suspended, I'm OK with them getting second chances, my son did get chances but then rules are rules and my son didn't punch anyone and does get suspended.</Review>

<Review>It has been seven years since I left the academy. This experience changed my life. I am currently in university maintaining my 4.0 gpa studying architectural engineering. I suggest any person to go to this academy because of the various lessons I have learned not only about myself but how to live a healthy life. I would not be where I am had I not gone to this life changing academy.<//Review><Date>1527882961377</Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rating>

<Text>Worked on a Project adjacent to the Acadamy for several months - the at times' audible residuals were powerful, genuine and left a lasting positive imprint - even for an adult.  The leadership is passionate about instilling dignity, self respect, healthy self esteem - all
bundled into a humbled, prideful, postured, head held held high, better version of where you were before you entered the program.< /Text>< rating>

< Review>
The kind of place we love to drive 17 miles for. Excellent authentic pasta and excellent authentic Roman pizza.  And once you meet Marco you will know why. He possesses a genuine passion for authentic Italian food. If you need pineapple or pepperoni on your pizza this is not the place for you.</Review>

The food at Fatto a Mano is always great, pizza, pasta, cake... everything I've ordered has been incredible, AND Marco and his staff are wonderful. Thanks for roughing it out through the lockdowns guys!</Text>

Delicious fresh pasta and pizza coupled with amazing service. You can’t help but love Marco! His welcoming smile is contagious and his food is to die for. The take home option is pretty awesome as well. Marco packages the fresh pasta and sauce separately and provides instructions on how to put it together. Love this place!!!< /Text>

<review>I’m surprised I didn’t know about this place sooner! I love fresh pasta and it’s so convenient here with good quality ingredients. They even served me an espresso while I was waiting. I was so happy with my meal. I don’t think I’ll go anywhere else for fresh pasta.<//review>< Pics>

Great pizza, great pasta, and great service. Selfishly I wish this place wasn't so popular so I could get my food quicker.<//review>

The only complaint would be that my husband and I both ordered at the same time and his dish came out around 7 min before mine did.

<text>I called ahead to make sure I was able to pick up what I needed. The pasta(spaghetti) was a bit gummy even though I followed their instructions, but i want to be fair and it could have been how I made it? I made pasta aglio e olio for my dad and family on Father's day. They did enjoy it but we all felt the same with the actual pasta. I will definitely try this place again and select a different pasta maybe.</text>< Pictures>

That means the pasta will end up sitting in non-boiling water for a good amount of time, resulting in gummy, clumpy pasta.\n\nChristy I must confess, I thought I read all kinds of review in twenty years in the field, but a 3 stars reviews for something that we have no control on, was missing from my collections on questionable reviews.\n\nTo give you a more specific understanding, knowing that you work for TTA travel agency in Torrance, is just like blaming the travel agency for having forgotten to put one of your personal belonging in your luggage before catching the plane. Silly right?\n\nChristy, thank you for giving us some good laughter in these crazy times, we all can use some of this.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMarco Pacelli - Business Owner"}</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b552b2971c45:0x18fe1368909add80</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>4</rating><Text>Another one on the local food scene. Your search for high quality carbs has another stop. Super friendly service, not too much space to sit, the store smells great. Roman style pizza. San Marzano tomotoes for the sauce, Buffalo mozzarella, basil. The dough proofed for 72 hours. The crunch is spot on but the sauce makes it. Eat right away! Housemade pappardelle pasta with a bolognese sauce. Light texture with just enough sauce to coat.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKBaYeXHp5r4VJmMly3BnHA-apIdY92MNA7xB-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOraO5RtPV2NfGAVNbuaDEP6VvBIiCUY2xW_NH0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

So good! The owner/cook is amazing, he is so welcoming and tells great stories. He wants to make sure that you love your pasta, so if you haven't had it before expect to be encouraged to try it on the spot and provide feedback. The clam sauce is perfect, and the Caeser salad is fantastic. Would definitely recommend to anyone that wants home made perfectly cooked pasta with tasty classic sauces.<//review>

<review>Respectfully, I would like to make a constructive criticism.  The pizza dough is extremely thick, would prefer half the amount used to make the pizza, it is kind of raw and sticky  soggy underneath, the sauce needs some kind of seasoning, it is too plain to the taste, be easy on the sauce, otherwise  the pizza  becomes soggy.  And that is how my pizza was very soggy, and  Please, please be more generous when  adding cheese, hardly found any on my pizza, and when adding arugula, do it sporadically, otherwise its too overpowering.  I would give your food a second chance, I hope I wont  be disappointed next time.  I want to believe that you can make better pizza than the one I got yesterday.  I was sad, because I had high expectations.  I really, really wanted to try your pizza for the longest time, and when  I did, I found myself not pleased.  I do not want to say : ' La tua pizza non e buona'.   Because we all deserve a second chance.</review>< pics>

{'time': 1603788781483, 'text': 'Greetings Wonderful Yirlanny,\n\nThank you for sharing your experience at our Pasta Shop.\n\nWe are sorry to hear that you did not enjoy our Pizza. At our Shop we offer Roman Style Pizza, made with a 72 hours temperature controlled matured dough based on Italian Imported Caputo Flour and an abundance of love!\n\nDuring our follow up phone conversation about your review, you mentioned that you were expecting to have a standard American pizza.\n\nGenerally speaking Roman Style Pizza is very different then standard American pizza and definitely a thick crust type of pizza.\nRoman Style Pizza is very light in the inside and crisp on the outside. As far as our sauce, we use Italian Imported San Marzano Tomatoes, dressed with Italian Imported Cold Pressed Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Salt and Fresh Basil, in line with traditional Italian pizza recipe.\nThe sogginess that you have experienced is actually caused by the pizza not being consumed immediately, in fact pizza become soggy when not consumed right away and with that, flavors can taste altered.\nFor more information about our Pizza, feel free to click on the link below.\n\npizzatoday.com/departmen…\n\nBeautiful Yirlanny while reading your review, I also recalled the interaction you had with our cashier: Checking in at our shop, in attempt to retrieve your order, our cashier had to literally go over every single order because you did not know neither under what name you order was, nor what were the items that your ordered. Preatty silly right?\nBeside finding this circumstance odd, I’m compelled to suggest that before going to any restaurant, you do some research about what you might like and order so that to have an experience that fit your palate and preferences. Needless to say, try to remember your name and what you just ordered. :)\n\nAs far as trying us again, my recommendation for future visits is to give us an opportunity to learn about your expectations, so that we can guide your through our menu options and shower you with love and attentions.\nAs far as this previous experience, I have already addressed your concerns personally and although you did not indicated it on this review you have expressed deep gratitude for our immediate follow up and action taken to make it right to you.\n\nWishing you well,\n\nMarco Pacelli - Business Owner'}< /resp>

They are very warm and welcoming, and are cooking Italian delights, such as the Roman style buffalo margarita pizza, Carbanara pasta, and the assorted cold cut platter. This place is easily one of the best in LA. A hidden gem tucked away in a tiny strip mall in Redondo Beach. Our new regular for great Italian food.

Better than Italy. This is hand made high quality food. Fantastic meals and prices. You won’t go wrong. Marco is awesome and the food is even better. I just spent two weeks in Italy and my best meal might not have been as good as this one. Eat here. You won’t regret it

Also, the place is tiny and better suited for take out. Don’t let that stop you. Hurry home and eat this food ASAP. Reheated on the stove the next day tastes even better. I always order extra so I have plenty of leftovers. This is one of my all time favorite restaurants.</Text>

I finally decided to try this place after driving by it so many times on the way to Redondo Beach.  My girlfriend and I visited the restaurant on Sunday evening a little before 7pm and it was full of patrons.  The owners greeted everyone and made everyone feel right at home.  The gnocchi I ordered was fantastic.  You can tell the owners love what they do, and it shows in the tasty food that they serve.  Make sure you call and order in advance to avoid wait times during the busy lunch and dinner hours.  It could take 30-45 mins for your food to come out.<//text>

O. Ver. Rated. Adequate though. Food was like something you'd whip up at home on a rainy night. Satisfying but lacking thrill factor. It took like 3 months to get one order of pasta. When it comes to service nice but not good.</review>

The pizza was delicious with thick - crispy on the outside chewy on the inside -crust. The flavors are lovely, showcasing quality ingredients. We loved the shrimp  zucchini pasta. The pear spinach salad was good. Pizza slices are a great deal, less than $5 for a huge slice. Our lasagna was delicious but a smallish portion. Will be 5 stars when they work out a few kinks. The Beach Reporter review sent more customers than they could handle adequately. We will be back. The owner and staff were super friendly.</text>

This is literally the best pasta I've ever had in my life. And honestly top 5 meals I've ever had in my life. And it's only $30-40 for 2 people. This place is absolutely insane. I love it.</Review>

Roman pizza to die for, the lasagna was fantastic. This is a fantastic place to go when you want authentic, Italian cooked food.

The dishes are simple, flavorful, delicious and delightful. Friendly staff.

Very very limited seating, food is cooked to order.

The Cacio e Pepe was one of the best pizza slices I've had since I last ate at a backstreet restaurant in Jessolo!< /Review>

I have had a lot of pasta over my lifetime and Fatto a Mano is by my favorite place.  The shops owner makes fresh pasta and sauce resulting in amazing pasta.  The pizza is also great with one of the best pizza dough's I have had.  Highly recommended.</Review>

<Review>I should know better than show up at lunch rush hour, but Marco and his helper did a decent job of attending to all on a timely basis.  This place is getting so popular it is no wonder, since the food is authentic in so many ways.  Marco says it is made with love :-) Thank you.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b552b2971c45:0x18fe1368909add80<//gmap_id>< response>

The Buffalo Margarita pizza was fantastic! The slice is big, hearty, and filling. Ok a dude note, this place is VERY small with minimal sitting space.</text>< user_id>

The guys here were amazing and service was top notch. They even called and asked nicely why I gave a one star, which was totally a typo and my bad. The food was good, loved the pizza but found cacio peppe a little bland for my taste buds, might be more Italian authentic and found the serving size a little small, one entree not enough. But will probably go again just for the pizza and experience.< /Text>

Very good food, and portions. Little bit of a wait and a tight fit, but worth it. Looking forward to trying them again soon. I suggest going early if you want something specific as your pasta of choice may be sold out. We like to order a spice of pizza as an appetizer while we wait.<//review>

{'time': 1571819651081, 'text': 'Greetings K S,\n\nThank you for writing about your experience at our Pasta Shop this past week end.\n\nWe appreciate your kind comment about our concept and our customer service. At our 650 sq Pasta Shop we pride ourselves in being the only Pasta Shop in the South Bay that provides fresh pasta made daily from high quality GMO free ingredients, mainly imported from Italy.\n\nWe are by all means a sophistication free 13 seatings Mom and Pops Shop, just like most places in my home land.\n\nAt our Pasta Shop we make all dishes to order and we proudly take care of one persons at the time. This is because we choose quality over quantity. On this note, whenever a visitor come to our shop we provide an accurate estimate of the time of preparation before accepting the payment, this allow the visitor to decide whether to patiently wait or come back at a different time.\n\nOn the same note, we also suggest to preorder your meal for dine in or take out, we are actually the only restaurant in the south bay that provide this service and most of our visitors seems to appreciate this option. Alternatively you can also pre order on line at www.Pastashoprb.com\n\nAs far as our food, I do agree that food fresh off the pan will alway taste better, however most of our food travel well as long as it is consumed within 20 minutes from being served. Food items that don\'t travel well like Cacio e Pepe Sauce, Carbonara and Mortazza pizza are actually available only for dine in.\n\nAs far as the rest of the items, after 20 minutes in the box, any pasta would get cold and when pasta gets cold, it releases starch, which ultimately result in what you have indicated to be a "pasta ball".\nFrom the description you have made, it sounds like your pasta was consumed past this time, and had we known that, we would have probably recommended our pasta and sauces  to cook at home instead. This is a solution mostly appreciate by visitors who will not consume pasta within the 20 minute time range.\n\nThe same occur with the pizza, although you can resolve this issue by reheating the pizza in any domestic pre-heated oven at 550 degrees for 3 minutes.\n\nIn addition to home made pasta, we are also one of the only five locations in the whole city of Los Angeles to offer Roman Style Pizza. A 72 hours temperature controlled matured pizza dough, that make a thick pizza fluffy and light in the inside and crisp on the outside. Roman Style Pizza is a type of pizza pretty popular in most Italian bakeries in Italy, often consumed as an full meal or simply as a snack. Most of our visitors find our pizza amongst the best in Southern California, however I realize that some people might prefer other types of pizza. At our Shop we offer Roman Style Pizza in six different versions, both by the slice or by the sheet. For more information about Roman Style Pizza, I have also took the liberty to send you a link, in case you would like to learn more about it.\n\nhttps://www.pizzatoday.com/departments/in-the-kitchen/knead-to-know-next-wave-roman-style-pizza/\n\nK S, we realize we might not be your type of restaurant, however should you decide to come back, my recommendation is to let us guide you in what we have offer and let us know what type of food you like, this will allow us to help you choosing food items that best for your palate.\n\nOn the same note, should you decide to buy any food items and learn that you are not happy about anything once you get home, feel free to call us on (310) 316 5111, you\'ll be amazed what we are willing to do to make you happy.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you back and showering you with live and attention.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMarco Pacelli - Business Owner'}<//Resp>

The concept is good - fresh pasta . Sadly the wait was long and the food I think is only good when you eat in . The place is too tiny though so took the food to-go so ended up with a pasta ball and the sauce dried on it . The pizza was my man draw but ur was dry and chewy . Think I just ordered the wrong things . Anyhow , if you are close worth a try if you can eat there. The customer service was good in that they are nice but the wait is taxing< /text>

As a 1st generation Italian American  I can say. This is the best pasta, cooked perfectly. (  It is very easy to over cook frest pasta, but Marco and Luigi have it spot on. ) Just like i would make with my Mom.   Love it<//Text>

<Text>Gotta send some love to Marco and his shop. This is real Italian. No bs pastas with microgreens with hiked up prices. This authentic, delicious, and the real deal. I’d love to see this place expand into a slightly smaller shop with the well trained staff in the back supporting Marco’s wave of real Italian in the South Bay. This is the Italian restaurant the South Bay needs.< /Text><user_id>114578781342723989546< /user_id>< Rate>

Hands down the best pasta in South Bay!   Pastas are made daily with traditional Italian sauces. Not the Americanized versions.

This is a true Pastaria!

Marco is great and as a true Italian I will say

Tried the cacio e pepe spaghetti. The pasta was amazing, perfectly fresh and al dente. The sauce was also spot on.
Friend got the gnocchi and it was delicious but the portion was a little too small for the price. It is LA though after all.
Took about 30 minutes to make the pasta during a reasonably busy time. They were making all of the pasta to order during dinner service.  Reading the other reviews I would call ahead to place my order if I came back.
Real pasta made by real italians, small menu so you know everything is fresh -- you can't really go wrong here!<//Review>

<Text>Not a fan. not the worst pasta I’ve had but not the best . Perhaps an off day . They seemed to be low on certain item because the two people ahead of me had to change their order twice and seemed disappointed . Guess I lucked out they had my desired dish . Place is tiny .

Dining out during Holidays can certainly be an overwhelming option, this is because during these days most restaurants experience high business volume and all consequences that comes with it such us selling out some of the most popular items.\n\nEvery single item featured at our 650sf Pasta Shop (pastas, pizza, cakes and sauces) is handmade and some items like pizza and Bolognese sauce, takes respectively up to 72 hours and 24 hours to be made. For this same reason, whenever we sell out any of these products, rather then "cutting corners" and compromise the integrity of our product, we prefer to temporary discontinue whatever items has been sold out and continue offering what\'s available. When such situations occur, most guests appreciate our integrity and decide to either order something else or come back in the future.\n\nWe are sorry to hear that you did not find our pasta amongst the best you have had, and we would love to learn more about it.\nShould you have the opportunity, we encourage you to update your review and share more details so that we can address your concern and grow with\n\nIf more convenient, we would love to hear from you directly at our shop.

Combined review based on2 separate visits. It went from a 5 to a 1.

In 29 years living in the U.S., I’ve never had a lasagna nearly as good as the one I had tonight (July 4th, 2019). Marco is a phenomenal chef and a great guy. His place is legit!

August 31, 2019:
I promised my son I was going to take him to Fatto a Mano to try the best lasagna. So we went last Saturday at 1120. Met with Marco and he did not recognize me. He was deep in the weeds, extremely busy and working by himself. He told us he ran out of lasagna, so we ordered the fettuccine bolognese and spaghetti carbonara. Marco was working by himself!!!! I felt so bad I was thinking I should get in there and help him out. He had 5 orders ahead of ours and we waited 45 minutes. The bolognese was good, but the carbonara was a huge disappointment, raw pasta, cold sauce, raw pancetta, watery and bland sauce. Right before we left, an employee shows up.

My experience went from a solid 5 stars in July, to a 1 star last week in August.

It’s pretty sad that you had to sacrifice quality like that Marco. And it can’t be healthy for you either. Next time, you should open later when you have the required help you need. You can’t run a kitchen and take orders by yourself and expect to put out a consistent, high quality product.< /review>

{'time': 1569733554974, 'text': "Greetings Luigi,\n\nThank you for writing about your experience with us.\n\nIt was nice meeting you and your lovely wife on July 4th. I remember you guys joined us at our corner table and were super excited about our Lasagna.\n\nI appreciate your kind comments posted shortly after on Google.\n\nLuigi I'm sorry that your next visit was not as exciting as your first.\n\nIt is definitely possible that I did not recognize you. Meeting so many people every day, I do struggle to remember each an every name and face, yet I enjoy treating everyone as a member of my family anyway:)\n\nIt is also possible that we sell out of our Lasagna Bolognese, this typically happen during very busy days.\n\nI appreciate your kind comments about our Bolognese sauce, it is made with San Marzano Sauce, Beef, Pork and Guanciale cooked at 200 degree for 24 hours. This process allow the sauce to absorb all the flavor from the meats and in my personal opinion it makes it a great sauce. The same sauce that we also use for our lasagna Bolognese.\n\nAs far as our carbonara, we make it with guanciale, Italian Imported Pecorino Romano, 36 month aged Italian Imported Parmigiano Reggiano, egg yolk, pepper and our secret ingredient....\n...love!:).\nThe pasta should be al dente, Guanciale slightly crispy and the texture creamy.\n\nLuigi, I'm sorry that we did not manage to keep such standards on your visit, so much so that you felt compelled to bring your rating down to one star. My team and I are keen on providing only quality dishes, at the same time we recognize that we are not perfect and from time to time mistakes happen and what we learn from it is totally up to us.\n\nAs far as my health goes, I appreciate your concerns however I feel in preatty good shape and having the privilege of doing what I love, I don't call it work, rather my hobby and passion. Life is way to short to work just a job.\n\nShould you decide to visit us again, feel free to take advantage of our customer service and let us know about your experience while at the shop, you'll be surprised to see how much pride we put in making our visitors happy.\n\nOn this note, if you decide to come visit us again in the future, feel free to give us call to ensure that our Lasagna Bolognese is available.

Super fresh assortment of pastas and sauces made daily. To top it off you are welcomed by Marco, the friendly Italian from Milan. Can't help but love the guy.

There isn't a lot of room to sit so it's a good place to get delivery - - doordash, Uber eats, etc.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Favoloso! If you like freshly hand-made Italian food, you will love Fatto a Mano! The Margherita pizza is to die for! As for pasta, I tried the hand-made Cacio e Pepe Cheese with Ricotta Ravioli. Delizioso! And for dessert, try a slice of pie 🥧 or cake! Grazie, Marco!< /review>

Great shop, great staff, sometimes a bit of a wait but it's worth it! Order ahead if you don't like waiting. Also, stop adding Parmesan cheese to their prepared pasta. Don't mess with a good thing.<//Review>

< Review>
It has been two years using HOCOA for our seven units in Oceanside that we manage from Palm Spring. They have made it so much easier by introducing us to hard working, honest, and reliable contractors. We use to have an issue in finding contractors that would be willing to work on our rental units and actually show up but since we have started using HOCOA that issue has diminished. Now if we have an issue we just send a quick email or text to HOCOA services and they get on it right away, they even follow up to make sure the contractor has contacted you and you are satisfied with their service. The customer service is definitely their strongest quality. I highly recommend using this service, it is incredibly helpful especially in a time where you need quick service. They have already done the hard part to vet out unqualified and unreliable contractors. All you need to do is call them. Trust me you will not regret it.</Review>

<text>HOCOA is a great place to find house related projects/services in the San Diego area. Sam is very professional. I have used their services in the house a few times now. Once I contacted Sam, he quickly responded and my repair request was taken care of immediately. Also, he did follow up with me to see if I was happy with the service and everything was done as I wanted it to be. Great service! My experience has been pleasant so far with the people/companies who came for the house projects. They were professional and did excellent job and the most important thing (for me) is that they were happy to answer all my questions and provided suggestions if needed.  Will be using HOCOA in future for sure!</text>< pics>

<Review>As a real estate agent and property manager, I am always in need of reliable and trustworthy contractors. Sam & HOCOA go above and beyond to find the right company for any type of project. No job too big or too small. Every time I contact HOCOA they put me in touch with a professional contractor. I don't have to waste my time getting estimates and wondering if those companies will do a good job. HOCOAs contractors offer quality service and unbeatable/competitive prices. Thank you to Sam and his team!< /Review><gmapID>0x80dc721a442311db:0xebda5064b507b34f< /gmapID><userid>111080757229851733811</userid>< Response>

<text>HOCOA is great to work with when you are looking for home improvement. Talk to Sam! He will listen to what you want to get done and find a good match for you. I was tired of getting bath remodeling companies calling me to do my entire bathroom when all I wanted were my countertops! Sam connected me with a great company.

Sam and HOCOA expertly contacted an electrician and handyman for my rental property in Carlsbad.  Both did good work and satisfied my tenants entirely.  Sam was easy to contact by phone and text.  He followed up to make sure that I was happy with his service.  I highly recommend Sam and HOCOA for their professionalism.</Text>

The pros that HOCOA referred were excellent, arrived in a timely manner and when they left, the work was done correctly and there was no mess.  I was told up-front the cost, and that was what it cost, no surprises.  Plus, met some really nice people.  Will definitely use HOCOA when I need professional repair work.< /review>

He was kind enough to gift me a one year membership to the Home Repair Network as a thank you for his business.  The follow up call to the message I left for service was prompt, professional and courteous.  The organization that provided the service I requested the first time I called was exactly the same.  I could not have been happier.   The price was very reasonable as well.  My experience the second time I called to price a different service was not as favorable.  The vendor did promptly follow up and we set a tentative appointment subject to confirmation, but  I was never able to reach him again.  That is why I gave HOCOA only four stars.</Text>< Rating>

This company provides concierge services for homeowners.  All repairs, improvements and maintenance for the home is provided by licensed and vetted trades people with a true wholesale pricing on materials.  HOCOA also follows up to ensure that members are well taken care of.  Sam Goodwin is helpful and is there to make sure whatever service has been ordered is done satisfactorily and in a timely fashion.  I recommend.</review>

When you need a home repair, like I did--leaky pipe in shower next to bed room, you usually don't have a lot of time to screen contractors who provide such services.  Fortunately, I was able to count on HOCOA, who have a network of reliable service professionals they refer to.  The crew they recommended for the job was timely, and professional, and very cooperative with our particular scheduling issues.  The job, which required not only pipe repair, but drywall replacement and other mitigation services, proceeded at an even pace, and was finished within a reasonable time, and looked great.  All the while, HOCOA representatives checked in periodically to make sure things were going along smoothly.

HOCOA is a great resource to have available in your time of need, imho, and I'm glad we have it.< /Text>

<text>What I liked most about HOCOA was the prompt customer service. I called HOCOA to get a fairly large landscaping project done. Sam connected me too three companies that all came out within four days to bid out the project.  Two weeks later we have the backyard of our dreams.  We were so excited about the service HOCOA gave us we are currently having Sam at HOCOA help us to bid out are upcoming kitchen renovation. Fast, prompt, and A+ service. No need to go to anywhere else. Thank You HOCOA!!<//text>< user_id>

HOCOA is a resource you don't want to be without, great for homeowners, business owners, rental properties and more. They are a one stop place for your home repair and maintenance needs. So grateful to have their service when my water heater started leaking.  I knew the plumber coming to my house would be someone I could count on and I was not disappointed. Excellent service, great resource and time saver!</text>

< review>
I interviewed Sam Goodwin at length about Home Repair Network and walked away impressed. Why doesn't every business operate with the same level of integrity and customer interest as HOCOA? Did you know only 20 percent of the businesses he interviews -- and he does the face-to-face interviews with all contractors himself -- meet Sam's standards? Or that business records are searched monthly to ensure establishments have the required insurance and licenses to operate? Or that he follows up customers to ensure they were treated right? This kind of customer advocacy and personal care is almost unheard of today. I've  recommended Home Repair Network to my friends and highly recommend it to everyone else as well.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Having done work for HOCOA as a Licensed CA Contractor, I can talk about the professionalism of the organization firsthand. 1) They screen their contractors well, and in person.  This is not a 'Check-contractors-out-on the-phone-and hire-them' type of organization.
2) They follow up on contractors' performance on the job, this is what I believe is an extra level of care, in addition to being a form of quality assurance. While an individual might not call the company specifically to complain about a contractor, they most certainly will voice their opinion if the company contacts them to see how the job went.
and,
3) I have used them myself as I needed a specialty that I did not, or could not personally perform.  That perhaps is the best testament I have to HOCOA's ability to perform.  Do yourself a favor and employ HOCOA for yourself and you'll understand.<//review>< pics>

<text>So I needed an Elliptical exercise machine for my home.  I shopped and compared.  I found the best price, on sale with Sears.  I knew HOCOA had a relationship with Sears so I asked Sam to see if he could beat the Sears online price.

He submits the request, a Sears rep calls me in a few hours with the price.  HOCOA saves me $200 on the same item.  I took the option of free shipping to my local Sears store for pickup.  Sears calls me when it arrives.  I go to pick it up - It is guaranteed to be presented to me within 5 minutes or I get a $5.00 coupon for my next purchase.  It took 7 minutes and I got a $5.00 coupon.

What a great experience and so simple. Thanks for the savings HOCOA!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

HOCOA has been very helpful and quick to respond with connecting us with maintenance service contractors for our rental property in Oceanside.  We live out of the area so having a local contact has made it easier to manage the property and ensure our tenants receive quick turnaround on any problems they have.<//text>

Giving them the gift of access to HOCOA's services for one year is a great way to set us apart from the rest of the insurance companies in California.  Our clients receive quick responses when a loss happens and that helps to minimize the amount of loss when it is handled quickly and correctly!

Having a baby in the house we needed to have it fixed quickly. After setting an appointment with one of the larger Heating and Air companies (for the following week) I decided to call HOCOA. I explained our situation and Sam said he would have somebody call me immediately.

My phone rang within 5 minutes and it was Josh from All Day Heating and Air. He said he could come out the next day (Friday) between 12 and 2. Next morning I got a call from Josh at about 11 to say could he come early because their last job was complete.

Josh and one of his guys spent almost three hours troubleshooting a blown transformer which turned out to be a short where mice had eaten through the wiring in the wall.  I can't say enough about the level of service and expertise of HOCOA and  All Day Heating and Air. In addition, the pricing was astonishingly affordable and far less than what we had paid for previous repairs which were far simpler.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Dr. Cardall and his staff are by far the best in town! At every visit I am always greeted by the sweetest, welcoming and friendly staffs who are always explanatory and makes me feel comfortable. Dr. Cardall is so nice, gentle and patience. Even with his busy schedule he manages to get the procedure/treatment done with great outcomes. I’ve had braces for quite sometime now and was still insecure about my smile. At my last visit he temporarily lengthened my top four teeth’s. As I was driving home I looked in the rear view mirror and saw the results and instantly cried with tears of joy. I was so pleased, excited and happy on how big of a difference my teeth and smile looked. For the first time in my life ever I was able to smile big and happily showing my teeth. I am so very grateful for Dr.Cardall and his staff and highly recommend his dental office to everyone! Thank you, again team Cardall you guys are the best!< /Text>

Best orthodontics in Bakersfield, been going here over a year. Best team and Dr. Cardall is the best orthodontist in the game, cool, kind, and funny guy. Shows lots of care for your teeth and wants the best. The nurses have great energy and are the best. Wish I could put 10 stars!!! Highly recommend.</text>

<Review>Dr. Cardall and staff are absolutely fabulous!  My bottom teeth were extremely worn down, by at least 2/3 of normal size. Dr Cardall was able to reposition my bite so that my dentist was able to restore my bottom teeth to normal size.  I now have the smile I've wanted for years!  No more closed mouth smiles for pictures 😁  Thank you so much Dr. Cardall and staff.</Review>< pictures>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>After having experience with other orthodontists, Dr. Cardall is definitely the BEST!!!. He and his office stuff are always friendly and accommodating.  During  Covid this past year, Dr. Cardall and his stuff worked until 9 PM just to accommodate their customers after the shut down. Most importantly, If you do break a bracket or have to change your appointment, his office stuff will do their best to get you in within a timely manner. Finally , Dr. Cardall did a great job with my treatment and at a very competitive cost. I highly recommend Dr. Cardall!!!< /review><response>{'time': 1618866336567, 'text': 'Wow thanks so much for the kind review Debbie!!'}</response>< date>

Dr. Cardall and his staff have been AMAZING the last 2.5 years. I could not be happier with another orthodontist! He did exactly as he said and the treatment took the same amount of time he said it would. Everything with them has been top notch and such an easy process!
Thank you Dr. Cardall!</review>

< review>
Love Cardall Orthodontics! I originally came in due to severe ‘TMJ’ jaw pain and was told that by correcting my overbite it would help and I also wanted my teeth as straight as possible and he achieved that and I only had to have my Invisalign on for nine months and I have had zero jaw pain since my overbite has been corrected! He genuinely cares about his patients and goes above and beyond to give you the perfect smile! So happy with my results, my teeth are perfect now! Can’t wait to post my before and after photos! So glad I found this place! I wouldn’t trust anyone else to touch my teeth after my experience with him! He is very professional and takes the time to listen to all of your concerns. I highly recommend this place. And not just for the orthodontist, but also for the dentist here to, Brimhall Dental group. Both my husband and son go here now as well.< /review>

We try to make the best treatment affordable for everyone and are so happy you have enjoyed your time with us!'}<//resp><Text>I’ve been to many dentist and trying to find the right place to do my treatment and this place was the BEST! From the very moment I walked in for my consolation with my niece they were the kindest and generous staff giving her all sorts of treats while the financial advisor helped me with my treatment plan. And even when I thought I couldn’t afford it they helped me even more and made sure the payments would be good for me instead of charging me a boat load. And every appointment after that was amazing they’re a very friendly and helpful staff a great place to come and chat or get your braces done. I loved coming it was a great experience every time. My favorite dentist lady was Aspen, she  always looking out for me and trying to get me in for the best appointments and she worked with my schedule more times than I can count. So if you’re reading this thank you for making my experience better. Have a great new year and get a new smile with Cardall Orthodontics.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Cardall Orthodontics has been amazing! I haven't had any complaints with them. Anytime I needed to reschedule an appointment (which were a couple of times), the office was quick and happy to help. Their office is clean and welcoming, while their treatment is quick and very effective. To much surprise, I was able to get my braces off early! Thank you to Dr. Cardall and his hardworking team, you guys are great!!<//Review>

<review>Cardall has been thorough and efficient with every visit making the whole process of braces easy.  With a busy schedule we’ve been able to get in and out easily which helps a lot. They’ve also been very good in answering questions or walking us through each visit.  Bonus is you can take your kids dipping dots after each visit because they shouldn’t be eating that stuff with braces. So I get something out of it too!</review>< Pictures>

Dr. Cardall and his staff make you feel like you are close neighbors dare I say family! Definitely feels like there is a good southern hospitality theme when you go into the office, but instead of sweet tea or lemonade they give you dippin’ dots every visit! This place is great! I recommend this place to everyone!

I was originally supposed to have my braces for about 12 to 14 months but that changed due to COVID-19. I ended having my braces for 18 months, but despite set back they made it right. Dr. Cardall hit me with the news I was going to need the braces a little longer than expected due to the combination of the pandemic and my stubborn teeth not wanting to shift. Dr. Cardall made sure my teeth were perfect before removing my braces. He has pride in his work!  I am extremely happy with how my teeth are now.</text>< Pics>

I'm reviewing 5 stars because for the past 2 years of being in Cardall Orthodontics, I never had a problem or complaint. To start off, the office itself is modern and stylish. The receptionists are patient and kind. Whenever I needed new rubber bands for my braces, they happily gave me more. Not to mention I got 'Dip N' Dots' at the end of every visit! ( several flavors to choose from) Everyone there is really nice and professional. I'm pleased to say that even though Covid-19 has made everything difficult, that I feel safe with all the regulations that are done there. I'm a bit sad that  I won't be going there anymore, but overall pleased with the outcome of my teeth, now straight. I feel more comfortable smiling, and that's really the most important thing: feeling confident in yourself. Thank you Cardall Orthodontist for everything!<//review>

For so long I've felt very insecure about my smile. I didn't like the way my smile was and didn't like to show my teeth at all. But when I came to Dr. Cardall he changed that for me, and ever since I've been comfortable showing my teeth and being able to smile. I love my smile now and am so thankful to Dr. Cardall and his team.</text>

Dr. Cardall and his team are just fabulous. They are all so kind and welcoming. My daughter just had her braces removed, and we are thrilled with her results. Her teeth/bite were not too bad when we started, but over the last 16 months of treatment, her smile has become nearly perfect. I'm so happy we found this team of professionals. We will definitely be back when it is time for our youngest to get braces.< /Review>

Everyone in the office is always very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing and positive. I especially appreciated their newer equipment as well. They use a digital wand to scan the teeth for both braces and for retainers. This method is so much better than the old way of placing a putty like substance in your mouth to get a mold of your teeth. I definitely recommend Dr. Cardall to all my family and friends!<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1596212375801, 'text': 'Thanks for your review and for referring friends and family!

<Text>Dr. Cardall and his team are absolutely the best, overall very professional. I definitely recommend Dr. Cardall if you want a perfect smile he really cares about the outcome of your teeth. I’ve had my braces for a year now, I am extremely happy and really love how everything is going so far.<//Text><name>Deisy Leyva</name>< Rate>

They have made the process of going back for corrections after 30 years so simple and pleasant.  I was impressed with the state-of-art assessment tools, the friendliness of all the staff, and the overall ease of the process.  Aligners have been my course of action and I am already amazed with the results 3 months in.  I highly recommend Cardnell Orthodontics!< /Review>< user_id>

Great and friendly staff. Had a staff member call me out of the blue, remembering we were needing some more rubber bands, and was able to help us get more because we live out of town.

<Text>When we brought our son Aden into see Dr Cardall his mouth looked like something out of a horror flick!  2 years and 29 days later, he looks just like Brad Pitt!  I’ve never seen a teenager smile so much.  In all seriousness, Dr. Cardall is a master of his trade and has a very professional, and courteous staff.  We have every intention of bringing our younger son to Dr. Cardall so he and his team can work their magic once again.

<Text>I took my son to various orthodontic offices in town. Dr. Cardall was hands down the best! He took time to talk me and my son about the treatment he needed. He was patient with my son and showed genuine interest in what he had to say. Even though Dr. Cardall did not feel it was the right time to start his treatment, my wife and I are assured that we have found our orthodontist. We highly recommend Cardall Orthodontics.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I lost my retainers and my teeth fell back to how they were. When my sister in law said that her kids were seeking treatment, with Dr. Cardall I called and scheduled an appointment. I have loved seeing the progress of a better smile. I was always self aware of it, and it made nervous to smile or laugh. I’m still not done with treatment, but it has raised my confidence in smiling. I love their friendly staff, and understanding in the procedures. Every time I come in, I’m met with a smile!
I recommend Dr. Cardall, if and when my kids need treatment, I will definitely come back to him. If you’re looking for a better smile, come to Dr. Cardall, he is friendly and talks with you at every appointment.<//text><name>Adela Meng<//name>< UserId.>

Cardall orthodontics is the best of the best. I've never had braces before and Dr. Cardall makes it easy and comfortable and you always see him at every visit and he makes sure your braces are perfect for you. The staff is awesome as well they always have a smile when you walk in and they make sure they can get you in if you need something fixed, or whether you have any questions either they or Dr. Cardall will answer them.

Bonus is you get dip n dots after every visit too.
Best Orthodontist office ever!!!</review>

Loved how the doctor explains what they will be doing every visit and how he walks you through your process with detail. So far i have had an amazing experience every time i come and there’s no doubt you will have one too! 👌 Definitely recommend Cardall Orthodontics<//review>

Cardall Orthodontics is a step above. They truly care about the patient and not about their bottom line. My two girls are always so happy to go see Dr Cardall and the lovely assistants. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful! We can already see amazing results and can’t wait for the final product. Thank you Dr Cardall!< /Text>

I went in for an estimite and they were able to fit me in first thing in the morning. They set me up with 7 of the plastic retainers to where my teeth would be straight in about 14 weeks. It was an affordable, and convenient option for me because i didn't have to come into the office more that 3 or 4 times.< /Text>

I had a great experience with Dr. Cardall. He was professional, friendly, and exceeded my expectations. I had Invisalign for 9 short months and was very pleased with the care and results. He was helpful and prompt with any question or concern I had. When I lost my retainer he got me fixed up with a new one no problem. I was able to get appointments booked easily and didn’t have long wait times. You can tell he cares about his patients and loves what he does. It definitely shows in his work!</Text>

Dr. Cardall and his staff are professional and friendly upon arrival making you feel welcome. Dr. Cardall explained the process of my sons braces to myself as well as including my son in the conversation. This made him more at ease and comfortable with the process. His new office is very welcoming and comfortable also.<//text>

I began with him in spring of 2019 to fix a few issues that time and earlier orthodontics never solved.

My wife saw the results I was having and began treatment just a few months later.  Now, the first of my three daughters is beginning her ortho treatment.

Cardall’s office is phenomenal. We switched to them in February and would not have it any other way. They are warm, welcoming and have a genuine concern for their patients. My daughter always looks forward to her next appointment. Highly highly recommend them!< /Review>

Dr. Cardall is amazing! I didn’t get braces until I was 30. He went over all my options with me and answered any questions I had. I had a very gummy smile but couldn’t afford to do surgery. He was able to use a different non-surgery technique to get the results we wanted. I have gotten so many compliments on my smile. He is very knowledgeable and great at what he does! I would recommend him for young and old! It’s never too late to get that perfect smile!< /review>

He is kind, gentle, and makes you feel you’re #1– and that is how he treats all of his patients.  Since all of my kids are finished with braces, I am looking forward to finally getting my turn!  I also love the energetic and fun atmosphere he provides to make it enjoyable for kids of all ages to go..  He’s the BEST!< /text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
After my wisdom teeth came out the made my bottom teeth shift quite a bit but the top as well and I became very self conscious, after visiting different orthodontic offices i finally heard of Cardall and I was starting to think I was waisting my time already checking out different places everyone seemed so pushy or rushed through consultations, I didn’t feel good or confident in any office up until Cardall’s it was quick in the lobby , they were super knowledgeable and I got to see Dr.Cardall for the consultation which I believe is very important to know who’s working on your mouth not just the assistants (but they were amazing as well) every thing was thoroughly explained and you just got a very welcoming feeling from them. I’m no where near where I’m supposed to be according to Dr.Cardall but believe me I see such a significant change in such short time and every time I go in they don’t change who they are they are still very thorough in explaining still very kind and welcoming.  I’m not done with my journey yet but my experience is soooo amazing and I definitely recommend this team to everyone! I am driving three hours for this service and best believe it’s sooooo worth it!<//Review>

<Date>1565381153745</Date><text>We love everything about this office! I came in with my super hesitant 12 year old and walked out an excited mom of a kid with braces! Lindsay is super sweet and comforting, the entire front desk is personable and pleasant to interact with and spend the time to not only make sure all your questions and concerns are taken care of but get to know each patient and their family personally. It's got a family feel when you walk in! Best of all Dr. Cardall is not only knowledgeable but gentle and sweet with my son. I was so nervous for this experience before we walked in, now we can't wait to stop by to see everyone, check on his AMAZING progress and eat some dippin dots!

One of the perks for us financially was that everything is included in our package. We have already had a few brackets fall off (kids!) but they got us right in and fixed them!

I would HIGHLY reccomend Dr. Cardall and their staff! If you're considering an orthodontist start following them on FB. You will see how fun the staff is just through their posts on FB!<//text></record>

< Review>
Took me a moment to figure out where the actual units were lol But once I did, it was marvelous. The unit fit everything from my 1 bedroom apartment appropriately. The most impressive part however was that through the sudden surprise from my move & all of the stress that follows suit - I totally forgot to put a lock onto my unit. The only way that I found out that I had not was that the next morning at the crack of dawn - I received a call from a female & a male named Tom telling me that they had checked for me, noticed that there was no lock, & immediately solved the problem by putting a lock on it for me to protect my valuables until I was able to put a lock on the unit. Very thankful for Tom & the mysterious female! Thanks Extra Space Storage!</Review>

I have been a customer at Extra Space Studio City for many years and Tom has been the manager all that time. This was my first time using the new digital lock system and I also signed up for an additional unit. Tom brilliantly found me a unit next to my current one so it would be easy for me to move my new belongings in while also changing items in my current unit. Tom made everything quick and easy. He also was very attentive to making sure I was comfortable using the new system. I thoroughly appreciate his easy warm manner and the cleanliness and convenience of the facility. Thank you Tom!<//text>

It is fantastic to have the convenience of a storage space so close to home. This space is soooo homey and aesthetically beautiful. Tom, the manager, has an amazing heart and that ripples through the entire place. You are always greeted with joy, and you leave brighter and lighter (both literally and metaphorically speaking) because of it.</Text>

This place is great. I have a lot of stuff and this place holds it all. If I dont feel like carrying my stuff, they have carts that I can use to carry my stuff for me. I’m not a very strong person so these carts are extremely useful for me. 5 stars from this customer. I’ll definitely be coming back. Cause I store all my stuff here.</Review>

The facility and the manager, Tom, are both excellent. The place is clean, secure, and convenient. Tom is so accommodating with finding the best options for our needs, and helping us manage the move in / around the facility. Prices are a little higher than other facilities but it's excellent value for what you get, in my opinion. And you can manage the whole set up online, which is a huge benefit for me as I move around time zones.</Review>

Extra space storage in Studio City was recommended to me by a friend who had a unit there. This was my first storage unit and it has been a great experience all-around.  I’ve had to access my 10x10 unit multiple times a month over the last four years — I’m so glad this was the place my entire life was being stored ! It’s always clean, well-maintained, and very secure.  The manager Tom is honest and kind and always a delight to deal with! And it was an added comfort knowing he lived above the property.  Not climate controlled but it wasn’t necessary; if anything it’s  a little cold in there when the weather is colder. Not a problem at all. Can’t recommend highly enough,  I’d give this place 10 stars if I could.</Text>

Best Storage in LA! We shopped around same day and called many other facilities. This was by far the best deal. First month free and great rates. Very clean, lit, safe, and easy. We had everything set up within 5 minutes and Tom was super sweet and lives on property.<//review>

This is a really wonderful storage facility.  Very well run, bright, clean.  Tom at the front desk helped me get a unit right away, explained everything very clearly, and was very professional-- in a relaxed, easy-going kind of way.  When I came back with my movers, it turned out my shelves wouldn't fit well in the first space I chose, so he immediately helped me find another unit where my stuff fit perfectly.  This is a unique storage place in that it feels very much like part of the neighborhood - friendly locals basically using it as extra closet space, or to deal with moves, etc.  I had previously stored my stuff at Public Storage a few minutes west on Ventura, and I'm finding Extra Space more reasonably priced and nicer all around.  Tom is so organized and polite, he sets the tone for the whole place!  An easy five stars.</Text>

<text>Just rented out a storage unit, was in crunch time to get all my stuff in before 10 pm. Let’s just say the co worker there took great care of me to wait an xtra 10 mins before he locked up the storage so I can finish, that was awesome! Plus the facility is top notch and very clean. Great service and clean units can’t get any better!</text>< Pictures>

Extra Space on Ventura Blvd is superior.  First of all, even though they do not claim it has AC - it is always cool, even though it might be 99 degrees outside, it is a cool 69 inside.  This is very important for companies like me who store tapes that cannot get too hot.  Must be because it is sort of built into the hill.  The guy who runs it is Tom.  He and I have become friends over the years.  He is VERY helpful.  I have stored at three other places in Hollywood over the years.  They often are damp & hot and have street people living in them.  Extra Space is a class act, clean cool & dry.  Attractive design is an added plus.</text>

<Text>I'm a big fan of the facility, the location. -And especially the management. I store some heavy equipment here, so the manager helped me find a unit that was accessible, the right size at a fair price. I've never felt for an instant that my unit was unsafe of not cared for.  They're also pretty understanding, since my paychecks come at odd intervals, and I pay rent on the unit at odd times of the month. Will do business here as long as I need a storage unit.<//Text>< Rating>

Super clean!! On the pricey side but I guess you get what you pay for. This place is immaculate. You get your own security code so they know who goes in/out and when. There's cameras so you feel safe too.< /Review>

I was a bit grumpy about even having to use a storage unit but this place makes it so much more pleasant. Staff member Tom is helpful, efficient and friendly; the space is really clean and well kept; security is excellent; and the location very convenient. Worth the slight premium over the older, more run-down options.</review>

Extra Space-Studio City is a wonderful and safe storage facility. The building manager Tom is very pleasant and knowledgeable to work with for all your moving needs. I have been renting a storage space since this January and  even had my Aussie movers comment on the building design, and how clean and maintained it is when moving my stuff in. When you choose Extra Space Storage you have security with a 24 hour live in manager, flexibility and ease with payments, extended opening and closing times and easy accessibility to carts and the elevator.<//Review>

The air circulation is very good. Tom is a great steward, he and the staff were receptive and helpful and personal.

I have been at the Studio City location for over 10 years. Tom Lasley, the manager, keeps a well kept facility, easy access, clean and he is always there to help with whatever your needs are..with a smile. I just drive right in and offload...easy. I've had other storage units in the past but they don't compare to this one.
A most satisfied customer<//text>

I was expecting nothing less than my experience with Brooklyn's Extra Space location. Tom and the crew are very warm and welcoming, always enough push carts, clean restrooms and extra clean facility. The A.C. is unbeatable with the unpacking. Thank you for helping me stash my artwork you all.

You live long enough, at some point,  your going to have to figure out what with all of your stuff.

When the time came to make space for the new by letting go of the old, there were a few treasures I just couldn't part with: the photos of my grandpapi, my pink converse roller skates, high school memorabilia, evidence of my most awesome trips to P. V.  etc. etc. etc. Rather than tossing  the souvenirs of my life, I found them a new home, Extra Space. Always immaculate, awesome staff, and great hours ( for when I wanna see my Stuff ) .< /Text>

< Review>
It's the little things that matter to me in having a storage space.  At this one the lighting is perfect, for example.  It lasts a long time and if it goes out, you just have to wave your hand in the air.  It's a clean place, the carts are sturdier than those I've seen at other places, the doors to the units are adequately wide, the floors are polished and the freight elevator is big enough to bring a couple of circus horses into.  It's well-tended, has good parking space considering it's in a crowded part of LA, and the management is friendly and helpful.  The only thing I might wish could be improved is the height and location of the keypad to let yourself in.  You can't use it from the driver's seat of your vehicle, but instead have to get out, punch in your code, then hop back into your car or truck while the gate opens. This is a minor hassle, I suppose, in what is in general an ideal storage facility.</Review>

Friendly, helpful staff, the property is always clean, the buildings are always cool, and it is never a problem finding a cart to use. The parking can be a bit annoying- but that's LA for you.<//text>

All in all, I was able to find everything I needed to grill up a nice dinner.  I liked that they encouraged social distancing and the staff was very kind.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Their produce is compatible with the big guys and you can fill your water jugs up here also. There's also a meat department where you can buy carnitas on the weekends and a prepared food department where you can order up a torta or bionico/fruit bowl or an agua. This store is very popular with the locals. Also on the weekends they set up a taco stand in front of the store.</Review>

Prices range from resonable to a bit expensive however produce and meats are fresh, and they have some great tasting snacks that are not found everywhere. They also have a mexican style restaurant (That looks and feels like a mexican restaurant). Definitely worth a visit.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>They always close earlier than 8:30 which is their actual closing time when I called to verify. Google hours are wrong. I got there at 8:25 and the worker just closed the door in my face even though I had called and they said they closed at 8:30. What kind of customer service is that????

You have to come here for the fresh fruit drinks. Watermelon, pineapple, cucumber and lime, cantaloupe, horchata, alphafa and spinach. A large container cost $3.5, this is the  cheapest $ I found for the size. Recommend their Tortas, grilled chicken, carne asada (grilled beef) and al pastor (marinated pork). They have a good selection of Bionicos (Mexican fruit dessert).< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very bad service. There is a very Young Girl who wears Glasses. That he is more pending in attending his text messages on his cell phone. What to serve the customer. And he's kind of ashamed to speak Spanish. If the majority of the clientele that we are there daily are Hispanics. And Ellla tells you everything in English. I do not recommend buying there

(Original)

I came here mid morning on June 6 for a new battery and right away was greeted with an attitude of an employee who seemed like he didn’t want to help anyone. I told him what car I had and he informed me that they had batteries available for my car. When I had asked him to help install it, he instead pointed to their tools and said I could do it myself and bring it in. I explained to him that a different Oreily had switched out my battery a few years ago, no problem and never asked me to do it. He stepped aside to ask his coworker if he can come outside to help me and I heard him say that he could switch it out by that my car is “newer” so there was a good chance that my car still won’t start with a new battery, unless I “reboot the system”. My car isn’t new. I had never been told this about my car before. They were either lying or don’t know anything about cars. They ended up switching my battery. My car still wouldn’t start. He again told me that this was because I need to “reboot the system”. There was corrosion on my clamps from the old battery. They didn’t clean this off nor did they tell me that the corrosion was so bad, that it broke the + end clamp (I later found this out at a Firestone). They didn’t even bother to offer to jumpstart my car. I had to go inside and ask them to do so. They let me drive off the lot with a broken clamp and kept feeding me lies about rebooting. Their service is the worst service I have ever experienced in my life, ANYWHERE. They are not knowledgeable and they lie to their customers. And come to find out, they sold me a battery that’s dated 3/2021. So aside from letting me drive off with my car in the condition that it was in, they also cheated me 3 months of a battery. Their warranty should read, “2 year warranty… give or take a few months”. This place sucks.<//Text>

<Text>My customer service associate, Carlos, was friendly, knowledgeable & helpful in finding my products which saved me valuable time on a busy day.  He was skilled at using the computer parts finder for my 2006 Chrysler 300C 5.7L Hemi.

The store was clean & well organized.

The overall cost of their products are on the expensive side.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>We were visiting from Nebraska and our vehicle battery died, I called and the owner answered, I told him what was going on and he offered to drive to our rental house and jump our vehicle and then have us follow him back to the store to get a new battery, he even installed it for us. He went above and beyond when no other parts store would. We appreciate it greatly, Thank You O’Reillys!!</review></record></dataset><record>

The people that work here are awesome. They go all out to be as helpful as possible. One time I was attempting to get a part that they didn't have in stock and after checking their other local stores only to find that they didn't have one either they called their competitor and got them to hold one for me. Service is always prompt and knowledge of parts is usually pretty good. Unless I have the time to get my part online or locate a Napa parts store, O'REILLY is my first choice!< /Review>

I went to get help with an engine check light. The guy was so rude, he made it looked like he didn’t want to be there and he was in a rush. After he just said “thank you for choosing o’reillys” (in the rudest way) and left when I still had questions. That’s not even the worst part, after he went to the front of the store and started to smoke a cigarette so obviously that tells me he wasn’t even busy! Also in the beginning the manager told me to wait 30 mins and then I saw him get in his car and leave. So I waited even longer. I do not recommend this place because it seems like the employees don’t like doing their job.< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Today June 26 I went to or Reilly auto parts to return the Master cylinder of the brakes that I bought yesterday. I went today in the morning and the guy who treated me treated me like I was a thief who wanted to return that part to grab money and told me I have no money in cash then I told him to put it on my card and I He said that I can not do it and he said come in the afternoon and when he came back he would not take care of me and I sent another guy to tell me to go to another store because they did not have cash there and when I asked which store he told me go where you want that is your problem the truth is sad that your own race you descriminate so I hope the managers of oreilly can read this and give more training to their employees and can treat customers with respect

<review>All sandwiches looked totally different than on the photos. Bacon instead of being crispy was almost raw - the worst made bacon I've ever eaten. Hotdog should supposed to be with no onion - I'm allergic to onion and the red fresh onion was there - i needed to throw the hotdog away due to that. I do not recommend this restaurant.<//review>< Response>

I just had the #7 meal (chicken sandwich) & ordered at the walk-up window. The food was prepared quickly and (even though I waited till I was home) it was very tasty. The fries always seem to be freshly cooked, as well. My only complaint, and it's A BIG ONE: this is the only restaurant available to pedestrians late night (till 3am every night), except Subway down the street, and they randomly close the walk-up but serve the lazy people driving at 2am for fast food. I know that lately it's been due to lack of personnel present for their shift, but you don't close the walkup. The cars can go anywhere easily - people on foot can't.< /Text>

<Review>I always order the boneless wings with a #KoolAid #slushie (my secret happiness in a cup)!
You've got to try this combo, you'll be so satisfied, plus they have 8 flavors to choose from for your wings! Meat is always white and juicy 👌🏾😁😋 @checkersrallys<//Review>< Pics>

It's okay!

The drive thru went into the street, and the wait time was long. About 10 minutes? 10 minutes to order, and then another 10 waiting for my food.

The soda was flat, and they had to check with me at the window what my order was, but at least they're making sure I don't leave without my food, so I greatly appreciate it!

The burger was still hot and delicious! I ordered the Buford, and it was just what I wanted!

The fries were soft, lukewarm, and kind of average tasting. They look really good with all that spice on em, but the crunch isn't satisfying, and the flavor is kind of bland.

I ordered mozzarella sticks, but they were out. I don't blame them, though, cause I came in at 9 pm xD

I also ordered the garlic chicken wings, which were SO good, the sauce actually tastes like it's made with real garlic, but the packaging is leaky. My home is only 10 minutes away, but the bottom of the bag was soaked with greasy sauce from the wings, and now I have this majorly huge, garlic-smelling grease stain on the front passenger seat of my car :/

It's definitely a place I'll revisit, but I don't think it's at the top of my list.< /text>

<Text>Awesome spot, just like the '90's. If you can, or live nearby, then find the coupons. They are more than worth it.

The Rally's now a days is extremely horrible and should be closed down. Needless to say me and my family will never go back. 10/10/19 Someone from corporate contacted me apologizing for my experience and offered me two free meals, that was almost two months ago and I still haven't received what was promised to me.

Went pretty far out of my way because I haven't had their fries since childhood. Once I got their I realized it was just another burger joint.  Tasted fine and the price was $8 for a meal, which is your usual burger joint pricing.  But again, it tasted like any other burger king orJack's, except way farther away.< /Text>

Whats can I say its Rally's in heart of Logan Heights!!  Now you dont have to drive far like to Spring Valley or Imperial Beach. Now you can get what you might call a "Unique So N So Hamburger Taste."
I recommend the fries and sums it up for me. This spot has a benches and the staff is nice only when the order is right. 😏<//review>

The quality of food is excellent! But the wait was a little long. They take care of the drive thru first. And to top it off, they forgot my damn apple pie!!! Tsk!<//review>

REALLY?! Google says you're open until 3am, however I'm not able to order something from drive-thru at 2:30am? Pick-up only?! What does this mean? Wasn't able to call an order in, so, seems kinda counterproductive. What do you have to say for yourselves?< /Text>

I have always loved Rally's restaurants so the difference for me is the service, environment and location.
Service was quick and friendly. Everyone there smiles.
Environment was nice, tables outside and the drive thru was moving along nicely.
Location was a little out of the way on a single lane street, however I have never seen a line of backup. Parking is not a problem.
Enjoy!< /text>

I'm a regular customer to this establishment never failed, until they change those chicken patties to thiner ones,  and last time they completely forgot about the order I place ending up waiting 30 minutes at night, for them to tell me they just forgot while other customer where getting their orders,  if you go avoid their host Kiara,  she completely disapeared after  I place the order and didn't even gave me the ice-cream after telling me to wait on the parking lot for my food, that never I got,  completely dissapointed.< /Text>

I was shockingly disappointed with the burgers because they just didn't taste as good. Maybe a bad first impression. However the fries and especially the mozzarella stick were really good. I'll retry later.</Review>

<review>Ordered a medium size #3 combo and 2 chicken bites boxes. I received a small burger and fries that looked like they were from the dollar menu, combo was like $8 ! Also for the chicken bites boxes they didnt even bother to put ranch in the bag ! Ridiculous. So disappointed. Hopefully they pay attention to detail and fulfill the customers needs and wants, since they are paying for their services. In the pic it shows almost no fries, my kids ate some but they werent even filled to the top as they should</review>< pictures>

They failed again to get my order right, they charge for condiments and I absolutely hate it when fast food places try to tell me they dont have soda water.   Yes you do, it's the water they mix the syrup with .   Avoid this fast food chain.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>It is a rarity that I stop in at a Rally's or Checkers. That very much is true. Another truth is that there are not many of them. That is perfectly fine by me, and it makes each visit worthwhile. I had the baconzilla combo. Bacon and cheese and the beef patty and the bun were very much as I remembered the last time I had it. Very straightforward. All stacked in a choreographed pile of goodness. My burger this time was no different. It had a good amount of bacon which provided the right amount of saltiness to compliment the beef patties and the melted cheese. The bacon had a good amount of crispiness too. The seasoned fries are a step above any other fast food restaurant standard french fries. Of course if you prefer seasoned fries. Which I do, and mine were done perfectly. I also had a strawberry smoothie that was very..... smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. Rally's and Checker's offer soft serve and other dessert items too. So on hot days it is worth checking out. Outside seating is only available. It is a very modern location and parking is available and well lit.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Food was awesome like always except I asked for no cheese or cheese sauce on my Roadhouse bacon burgers.  One had cheese and there other didn't. Drove couple miles to get to this location and on the way there I saw at least seven to eight Police cruisers.  Went to drive through and as I was leaving I didn't check my order because I saw a group of suspicious men very close to drive thru exit.<//Text>

<text>I've been a big fan of Rally's since I was teenager about 26 summers ago, so was glad to hear this Rally's was close to us. Drive Thru is poorly designed. Only 3 cars fit from the ordering speaker to the drive up window. That coupled with very, very (almost dmv'esque) slow and "don't bother me service" , we ended with a 26 minute wait start to finish as car #5 in the drive thru. Probably should give 2 Stars but in all honesty for the price the food was pretty good, an excellent value. This Rally's has alot of potential, with the right manager who can keep the employees happy, motivated and productive. Could really be an asset to helping the local community. Will come back again and maybe order at pick up window and see what happens. Was also very clean and well maintained on the outside at least.</text></record></dataset><record>

Newly open so of course there will be lines and crowds but the serivce was lackluster. The food didn't seem cooked correctly and they gave us rubbery and chewy mozzarella sticks even after bringing them back the second time it was the exact same thing.<//review>

I don't recommend this place if you want fast food.  It's ridiculously fat. Like juicy gross fat. Even the bread is soaked in fat.  Hardly finished my 🍔. Try to find another place across the street.  It's pretty cheap though.<//Text>

This place sucks! They had the Steak Burgers on sale for $1.99. So I ordered one at the drive thru. The girl asked me if I'd like the 2 for $6.00 deal, lol. The burger itself was over cooked and really small (much smaller than the bun) and had funky tasting grilled onions instead of the crispy fried onions that it shows on the poster.  Even at $1.99 it was a disappointment. Also the people could be a little friendlier and quit trying to screw people with the funny math.</Review>

Been trying to give it a chance , but 3 strikes is out! Terrible environment to begin , can't never enjoy your food with family , too much damp flys heading for your food! Annoying foul drug addicts bumbing for money or food , like they will ever change for the better , Careless customers service in the night shift and poor hygiene inside the food prep. erea  Is not hard too notice , just be aware if you care about your food safety and quality.< /Text>

<time>1529798188193</time><Text>Earlier today I stopped by to enjoy the BBq Mushroom Burger I had seen advertised.. it looked Delicious minus the Beef however.. I didnt see that as a problem since every fast food place in America I've visited will allow you to pay or even courtesy swap the Protein. Well.. not this establishment, I am disappointed not only at that but the service I received. When I asked for a manager to answer why this could not be done, the young man that came to the Drive thru window to answer the question in the Managerial position responded with a loosely "Yea" instead of "Hello, How can I help you? We can't do it because of inventory was my response"...I have been in Customer Service over 25 yrs.. not acceptable.. Rallys.. train your associates better and think of a better way to satisfy your customers that do not eat Red meat.
Thank you.</Text>< pics>
