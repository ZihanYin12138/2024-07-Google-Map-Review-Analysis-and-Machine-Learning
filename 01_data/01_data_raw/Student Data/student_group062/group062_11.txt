Two "top shelf Long Islands" for $122 total .. here's the Long Island in question

And I had to wait 15 minutes before I went to get the waiter to take my order.

This was a chill location. Of course due to the pandemic, you sit outside. There aren't many tables out and it can get packed quickly. They also do not write down your name on a list. Its first come first serve. The hookah is very smooth.< /text>

< Review>
First time checking out this place, and I must say it was a pretty terrible experience. Staff were pretty hospitable at first, but once we ordered and got everything, service pretty much went down hill from there. We had an issue with our hookah. After informing the staff several times there was an issue, they didn't really do much to resolve it. All of us ordered tea, which practically tasted like plain water.

All in all the hookah was pretty terrible, service wasn't all that great, and don't order tea there if you're a genuine tea lover. Definitely don't recommend this place at all.< /Review>

Nice chill spot to hang with friends and enjoy an over look of the city. It was one of the first places I went out to after moving to LA. I have yet to go during a pool party, but being here at sunset is amazing. Great music, friendly staff, and an overall great vibe.</Text>

<text>Went here for my 21st birthday, the security saw my ID and offered me a free drink as a celebration... which was awesome. The environment was very comfortable and casual. Everyone was very nice and social. The only downside was the bar-tenders. I waited over 5 minutes for them to finish their conversation to serve my drinks...

This place is so low key, you can't tell it's a hookah lounge from the outside. Inside it's pretty chill and low key as well, dim-lit, good vibes. They play really good music, and the hookahs are really good too. Service is nice. They only have drinks, no food. You can order for delivery from a nearby Mediterranean place but you can't eat on there after 9 or 10. I feel like a lot of the people who come here are regulars of some degree. Overall, it's a good experience.< /Text>

It would be nice if there were a pool table, but the crowd here is definitely classier than a dive bar.  The drinks are well made and a good value for what you pay.  The bartenders are also very friendly. Keep in mind, this establishment is not open on Sundays (unless there is a show), and closes all other days at 1am.</Text>

<review>Not very spacious but a cozy spot to relax and have a good time... the entrance to the bar is amazing... the bartenders dont just mix drinks... there is an art to what they do... the presentation is awesome... small and sometimes there is a wait... but it's worth it...</review>< Pics>

<text>Place was wonderfully decorated. Got a hookah and tea. Price was outrageous for what we got though. And despite the classy atmosphere music was too loud and they were playing some ridiculous reality show on the TVs. Staff was high out of their minds. Good if you wanna get drunk, party and smoke hookah. Not good for anything else.<//text><response>None</response></record>

Glass hookah lounge is my go to intimate hookah spot. There are some SECRETS behind its doors that i rather not divulge in risk of more people showing up, but i swear to all that the slightly higher price in hookah is worth it for the service, menu selections and overall ambiance. Its a great place to spend some time after a hard day of shopping on melrose.</text>

I love this place because of the non tobacco hookah they have, it's like stones with different flavors. It's different than other hookah bars, the service is great. They are always looking for customers if they are doing well and adding coals. Khaled is a great host. He is so nice and he welcomes you with open hands on weekends .<//review>

<text>Came here some time last year, and again about a week ago. It's a nice place, very chill. It's not somewhere you really want to go for a "night out" lol but it's cool.

Service is okay, this review is for management. My uncle was visiting from out of town. We went there, they sat us down in the main area and when we asked about the bar in the back, they acted like it was the Oscar event. RELAX. It's a hookah bar not private lounge in Cannes. The "security" was letting a lot of people go, yet told us and others is full capacity. Only in LA. We're from NYC so we've seen it all but this was just too funny.</review>

<text>The food is excellent. It's a calm and chill place to sit and relax, have a drink and let the smoke breathe in you.
Actually, I've never seen such a dedicated and friendly staff around here, I'd definitely recommend this Hookah Lounge. Just go ! No excuses :)< /text>< pics>

<text>This place is interesting. Love the hookah setup, love the atmosphere but the fact that there is no alcohol on premise, is slightly disheartening. The hookah was pretty basic.  Doing two hoses in a single hookah was not the best idea as well, as there is no function/ valve which prevents the airflow from the other hose or does not require you both to use the hookah at the same time.  The other thing I primarily faced with these types of hookah, one must cover the other hose when it is not in use.  The extra work slightly defeats the purpose of you not using the one you already have at home. I'd go back and give it another try but this time, knowing what I know, I would do a few things differently.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Racism still exist!, my family walked inside to empty tables and asked if it was ok to sit down. The team that worked the night of June 17 2018 informed us that the group(same race as the people working) that walked in 10 mins b4 us wanted the same table we requested and that we can't sit down because they are in the "Speak Easy" located in the back having drinks. We then informed them that it wasn't fair that there is empty tables and we can't sit do to a group that's in the back having an alcoholic beverages in another area of the Hookah Lounge. We also mentioned that we are spending money just as they are and that we deserve the right to be seated if nobody is present. After explaining our story the lady at the desk located near the speak easy had developed a very BAD attitude and  did a horrible job masking it as she asked us to be seated. While waiting for our hookah the group comes from the back as we sat and waited for 15 minutes(still NO hookah) they were seated and their hookah came in less than 5 minutes. My party STILL NO HOOKAH after 20 minutes. We left after explaining to the manager our situation and all he could offer us is a glass of water which is FREE or a soda for the inconvenience...  My Family is African-American,we LOVE EVERYONE we are all HUMANS  at the end of the day this NEEDS TO STOP!

Came by after a nice sunday of 49er glory. Haight festival was poppin and this was the first time  have ever been to this spot. You can get great amazing hookah for 15$ unlimited a person, and they mayor may not charge you for teasall night, and maybe some of that amazing pita bread and spread. omg delish.</review>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>Premium Hookah Lounge????

Really, it falls short on so many levels.

1st: This place is divided into different areas.  They have one area that looks less glamourous for smaller parties with tables and chairs for hookahing, they have an outside area that also has tables and chairs for hookahing and then they have this “lounge” area off to the back with couches and television for guess what even more hookahing. All areas don’t really have a cohesive them. One is really dark and the other has this blue/purple club glow but with a huge kitchen emitting light off to the side. It’s just odd and takes away from the ambiance.

2nd: Besides its odd décor and theme. This place was freezing. It wasn’t so bad since it was sort of hot at night but most members and my party complained of the air constantly blowing. Plus the dimmed blue and purple neon lights gave more of an illusion of just a cold atmosphere.

3rd: The bathrooms are unisex and there is only one bathroom per area, 2 private bathrooms in total. Annoying when  you have a group of ladies who all need to pee at the same time.

4rd: The vibe is REALLY laid back. Like everyone seemed to be on drugs in their own worlds. My friends and I seems like the only ppl talking. It wasn’t really the type of vibe one would care to have after a few drinks on a Saturday night. Was much more expecting a bit more noise, but it was silent.

5th: WE NEVER GOT OUR HOOKAH!!!! Mind you this place wasn’t even that packed but it took like 15 mins to get our order taken and another 20 before I just gave up on this experience altogether. We ordered a round of room temperature water and one glass hookah and neither ever came out. Our server didn’t even come by and assure us that our waters or hookah was coming out shortly. It was just HORRID customer service. Hookah doesn’t take that long to prepare no does a round of room temperature tap water.

Certainly not at all what I expected...< /Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

(Translated by Google) SHAMEFUL! Never set foot in this place. They welcome you, place you, and then ask you to get up for no reason and take you out of their establishment !!!!
To avoid !!!

(Original)
HONTEUX ! Ne mettez jamais les pieds dans cet endroit. Ils vous accueillent, vous placent, et ensuite vous demandent de vous lever sans aucune raison et vous font sortir de leur établissement !!!!
À éviter !!!</review>

<review>We just hired OC jumpers to bring the dual lane water slide for my son's birthday party. The slide was a huge hit and everybody that works for the company is so courteous and professional, we were super impressed. We had a small issue and contacted them and they came right over and fixed it up and then stayed for a long time to make sure everything was working. It's not easy to control mishaps but it's how you handle them and they handled it beautifully. We will definitely be back again.</review>< name>

My sis and I go here from time to time, really only if they have our flavor. Prices are high, $6-8.00 for a MED SIZE, maybe that’s the going rate, which is fine for a once in a while treat, these yogurt places are ok to sit and enjoy in, until a family of 5 or more come in with screaming kids, having no respect for anyone else, the Parents are responsible for the kids. Get it to go and all is well.< /review>

The place itself is good (clean, toppings are fresh, etc.) but when i come in at later hours, the young girl who's at the cashier kind of sucks (aloof/unwelcoming, cant hear what shes saying half the time, doesnt always offer a bag when you have multiple cups, etc.).

also, they don't always have sprinkles out, which is the real crime here.<//Text>

yogurtland is always a great place to go to for a nice dessert that is relatively healthy. I do have to say though that I do miss the graham cracker crust topping that they no longer carry at any of their stores. What's up with that!?< /text>

<review>Oh! This was awesome!  These people interpret what you ask for and then give you what they feel you really want!  Amazing.  I asked two flavors, and instead of those two, I got related but completely different flavors, which I didn’t enjoy, but appreciated the experience! Way to go. (I’m only being slightly ironic.)</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I've always loved Baskin Robbins icecream. Today I had my usual one scoop Jamoca Almond Fudge. It was only $2.89 but the scoop was very small. Last week I had same flavor at Marianne's Icecream in Aptos and it was pretty much $5 for one scoop but you get twice as much icecream! So what's it gonna be??< /review>

Baskin-Robbins, 41st Ave, has been part of my life since the late 70s. Being a chocolate freak BR has been there for me. Mocha almond fudge and Chocolate almond are my favorite flavors. The service is fast and friendly. Thank you.< /text>

The only reason it's getting a 2 star is because the ice cream itself was good, the price was fine, and the workers there were friendly.

<Review>Not to shabby on prices. Simple icecream without all kinds of confusing names. The girl who took my order was so on top of her game she got a 5 dollar tip from me. With all the distractions she didmt miss a beat.< /Review>< pictures>

You're in Santa Cruz go to Marianne's or Penny Creamery. Baskin Robbins is a consistent and predictable experience if that is what you are looking for, but if you have taken the trouble to visit Santa Cruz, experience lical quality.< /Review>

<GmapID>0x808e156bb408805b:0x59478ab7d9f9deb3</GmapID><rating>1</rating><Review>My family and I have loved Baskin-Robins for years. I grew up with BnR as my favorite ice cream store without a problem, so I thought I could take my kids to the local BnR and continue the tradition. Yesterday, when I was taking my youngest on a father/son date, we went to get a cone. The two Mexican female attendants were having lite conversation and a good ole time talking and serving a Mexican customer. Once that customer left, your BnR attendants wouldn't even acknowledge that my son and I were standing there to order. Note: My son and I are not Hispanic. You can take it however you want but this is not the first prejudice we've encountered from HISPANIC/MEXICAN employees when we go to our local venues. Thank you for the memories. It once was good. But after that treatment, I told her we would take our order else where, and we did. And you know what the attendant who didn't take mine and my son's order said? "Have a nice day." No apology, no professional courtesy. Yeah, thanks.</Review>< user>

New in 2020, this dog play area is expansive and generally pretty busy. It's also in a gorgeous setting in the park right near the bison paddock. It's a great jumping off or ending point for a walk in the park, as there is a decent amount of parking available.

It features a sizable area for small dogs as well as a larger area for big dogs. Both areas have a section of artificial turf and a section with sand and eucalyptus logs, with concrete walkways in between. There are park benches for pet owners to watch their pups play and dog+human water fountains.<//review>

This is an amazing renovation of a huge Dog Park inside of Golden Gate Park at 36th avenue. It has lots of amenities including sand, concrete and artificial turf. Even some   natural agility training on some logs.<//review>

< Review>
What a great place among all the majestic trees. It's a clean area with tree logs and sand, but the small dog park had no poop bags. Went around 3 on a Wednesday and there were about 12 little dogs. The big dog park had about 20 dogs running all over.< /Review>

This FENCED fake grass/ sand dog park is amazing, new and clean!
Newly renovated with ample of parking.

I brought my 12 lbs dog here and I feel safe for him to play in the area. Big enough for small and big dogs to run around.

There is an area also just for small dog.
There are dog walkers to bring lots of dogs around 11-12. I would avoid this time if your dog is timid.<//Text>

<review>Great open sand space for dogs! There's a large dog area, as seen in the picture, and a small dog area to the right. Both areas are very large, so if your dog likes to run large distances, this park is perfect! The sand is a bonus if your dog loves the sand, as mine does! Parking is also good, but it can be difficult during peak hours. This is my new #1 choice when I want to tire out my dogs! It's a great place for zooming out - so if your dog is prone to zoomies, come here to help them get it out!< /review>< Rating>

<Review>This place is great now that they have cleaned it up! I have taken my dogs here at least once a week and it's great to see them socialize. Most owners are cognizant and mindful. There's also a small dog are for the little furry friends.<//Review>< pictures>

Both areas have secure fencing, double gate entrances (that's a convenience) and provide varied surfaces of cement, artificial turf and sand. The large parking lot was full when I arrived so I parked along the park road. There are plenty of trails around the fenced areas for walking/strolling and the view of the adjacent Buffalo enclosure adds a nice touch. No human bathrooms, but nearby attractions do have restroom facilities.</review>< Rating>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>There's a small dog section and an all dog section. Both sections have an artificial turf area and area that is all sand with se obstacles to play around on. There are a couple of  double-gate entrances to each section, plus there are a couple of gates that can be passed through that connect the small and all dog section.

Overall it's well maintained and nice. The small dog section is pretty large, and the all dog section is huge. It can get extremely busy, but there is usually enough room to safely social distance. Plus, since there are multiple entrances it cuts down on congestion and having the gates being opened constantly. Definitely coming back.< /text></record>

<review>It's newly remodeled and has a smaller area for little dogs as well as a larger area for bigger dogs, just in case you want to keep them separated. There were at least 70 dogs playing there today. They were all very social and friendly with each other.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808587a3f3b3ae65:0x2d459452e7389b75< /gmap_id></record>

Big, wide space where you see a ton of dogs of all kinds. They also have a separate space for puppies, which is great if you’re isolating them!

Our pup was a bit overwhelmed I think and he didn’t enjoy all that much. But the park itself was pretty great!<//Text>

Amazing playground for dogs! Really amazing to see the city invest in areas dedicated to dogs!  Highly recommend checking this park out!

Do be aware that on weekends it tends to fill up too much... too many dogs end up in big dog fights, some something to watch out for :)< /Review>

Newly updated. Love the designated areas for big and small dogs. So far have only met amazing people and pups there. Parking can be a bit of a struggle, be ok with walking your pup a few extra yards.</text>

Awesome place for dogs to play in a secure enclosed beach-like area. No shaded areas for older dogs and puppies. Is it worth 2.4M and the time it took to renovate, I don't think so.</review>

<Review>Great dog park- tons of room and great vibe. It does not smell and even with many dogs it did not feel crowded. Needs a human bathroom or ports potty.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I take my dog here every day. He is a Siberian husky named Leo and he has so much energy.this is the only way that he can get out most of his energy without needing 3 more walks. Another great thing is that 8 can just sit there while he plays. I love this dogpark and I really recommend it.< /Review>

Great dog park with a variety of dogs and responsible owners. One told me on weekdays there are a lot of dog walkers resulting in crowded and possibly unfriendly environment, usually starting from 9am to afternoon, it dies down a bit after 4 or 5. The rest of time it is occupied mostly by dog owners, early mornings and evenings on weekdays or the entire weekends.

Parking was a bit hard to find. If you are on Fulton, come through 36th Street and go pass the senior center all the way till the end.<//text>

<Text>It is a good place to take your fur baby to burn off energy. But alot of dogs can be there during the workday and maybe busy on the weekends. The surface is sand so watch out for puddles and mud during the rainy season. There are 2 water stations with faucets for both dogs and humans located inside and outside the fenced-in area. It is on the north side of the Bison paddock so you might get lucky and see a Bison or two. The park lot there is small, it holds about 15 cars. There are benches and tables there for us humans or tired pups to relax on. There are plans to separate this into two areas, One for small dogs and one for large dogs.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I finally found a place to bring my dog without worrying about him running off. Fenced in. There are some people who don’t clean up after their dogs so there is an unpleasant smell in the air. But it’s a dog park so what can you do. Most people I’ve met have been nice and friendly. I go after 3:00 when it’s less crowded.<//review>< user>

A nice place- fenced in, plenty of playful dogs. A haven for dog walkers around midday, but later on, between 3-5:30, the locals come out with their dogs. If you come regularly enough, whether with the dog walkers or with the locals, you and your dog can both make some great new friends.</Text>

This park is filthy and disgusting. I really wanted to like it because it is fenced in and it is located in a nice part of Golden Gate Park. However, what I found was a dirt place that has the most horrible pee and poop stench, is overcrowded with dogs - all from dog walkers - that bark non stop and show aggressive behavior. No surprise: vans park, doors open, 5-10 dogs per van exit and the walkers don't take care of them at all. They don't pick up poop - and that's what the area looks like. Awful! It's a shame, this could be such a great place if it was maintained better and if they banned people with more than two dogs. That's why we can't have nice things :(<//Review>

I take my dog here quite often since I live in the area. There's usually quite a few dogs here for my dog to play with (both large and small since there isn't separate park areas for small/large dogs). If you prefer less dogs at the park, show up later in the day.
I do wish there was grass, and there's a bit of a smell on days with no breeze.</Review>

A large dog park. It's all dirt and dust, and mostly larger dogs. There is a water fountain on site.</review>

Lots of parking around 5pm.  Not much shade.  Very very dusty.  Has both a human and dog water fountain.  There is a bathroom, but it is by the lake 500 feet to the east.< /review>

(Translated by Google) A harmonious atmosphere and towering trees. There is a feeling of loving your own garden. The most valuable time is a group of smiling faces. It is a good park for tourists to go sightseeing.

和谐气氛，树木参天。有一种爱自家花园的感觉。最可贵的时有一群笑容欢喜的面容。真是游客去观光的好公园。< /review>

< Review>
Most of the employees give good customer service except  for one at the front counter. He needs to be nicer more patient and less cocky. I would give it 5 starts if it wasn't for him.<//Review>

Avoid this fraudster company at all costs! I wanted to order metal to have delivered to my house so they made me fill out the credit application and send them a picture of my license and credit card. I ended up not wanting the metal as they wouldn't meet their promised delivery date. No goods were ever received from them and they still charged my credit card. Absolute thieves.

Go to Patton's Steel in Burbank. Not only are their prices a lot better than Ramcast, but they also don't charge you for metal that you haven't received.</text>

This place is great. Selection is clean and offer great prices!!!They offer a smaller selection than the larger stores but don’t let that fool you. They have plenty of what you would need. Also help you find the right product with a great attitude. Small or large order they’re willing to help.<//review>

My coworker and I came here with our Vaccine cards in hand, hearing that Staples was laminating them as a courtesy. Coming into the store you can’t help but feel a bit sad. The store, lighting and general feeling is tired, run down and burnt out. Frankly I’m not surprised after this past year I can understand why the employees didn’t seem particularly thrilled with being at work.

We made our way over to the faxing and print services where we were greeted by the lovely Val. Her sunny demeanor helped to brighten the space around us and she happily took our Vaccine cards to make copies of and laminate. We chatted while she worked and discussed our journeys to get an appointment for the Vaccine. Once she was finished we inquired about the custom stamps on display and she recommended we check out the website to see more options and varieties.

After making our way to the register we encountered Miles. Soft spoken and incredibly kind he took the time to help me fill out an application for their rewards card which saved me money on this transaction!

Val and Miles, thank you so much for your excellent customer service. We will be back especially because of you!<//text>

I did catch the employees name who helped me, but she was friendly and helpful. If she some how reads this...printing...up scaling black and white to color...people still need hugs.
It seems most people use COVID as an excuse to make other peoples day go south or to put someone else in a bad mood.
I’m telling you, it’s refreshing to walk into a place and have someone help you who seems like they actually want to help you, and to top it off, be friendly while helping you.
You want to know what that makes me think and want to believe? There is still hope for humanity.<//Text>

Staff are very attentive and helpful. The place is organized well so easy to find any item in store, and online purchase pickup is pretty good as well. Prices are mostly cheaper than office depot or Amazon.< /text>

<Text>My friends and I shopped frequently at this Staples to get materials for a supplies drive. Elizabeth and Brandon were very patient and helpful representatives, and several times they helped us find products in the store that were on sale or that we wanted to buy but could not find. Chris, the manager, was also very helpful to us and on one occasion where the weather was warm even distributed bottles of water to those of us in line.  If you're looking for good service and a wide range of office and school supplies, this is a great store.< /Text>< resp>

<Time>1549871043252<//Time><Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Everything you could need for your office supply (for the most part). The shop itself is not crowded with people which makes it pleasant to find the things you need without a constant crowd avoidance strategy in play. The only problem with that is that i hope they make enough to cover the rent :)
I do wish they would open the parking lot up between themselves and Home Depot as I would find myself going there a little more often if they did (I find myself driving to Home Depot and could do with going to Staples but getting from one shop to the other is a bit of a faff, so i dont.

I stopped at Staples to look for a silver ultra fine line sharpie. One of their staff was able to assisted me and he said it was something they didn't make, drat!
Otherwise parking is easy, store wasn't crowded at 3 PM.</Review>

If your employees were very pleasant they tried to help as much as I could. But you don't offer the product that originally looking for. Avery Business cards. Or have them printed through your card center the way I want them printed. I was able to find the product online and ordered four boxes.< /Review>

I picked up 1000 cards for $20+tax.

I thought Staples was going out of business, but they've become kind of a boutique small business center. At least go to their website, they probably can help you.</Text>< Pics>

I normally would not give 5-stars for a Staples purchase but the sales person (Terri) that sold me my printer (and then some) was exceptional...I had no problem walking out of the store spending twice as much as I thought I was going to spend.< /Text>

Been to many Staples you may think the staff is bad at this place, you have not seen the other places or Staples to know this place is great!  The staff at this place really know how to work and take care of the customer.  Same people long time staff good store to shop at.<//Review>

JAN 2018 updated review: while this store has always had slow cashiers at least they were never rude. That changed today with the cashier that "took care" of me.  I was bringing cartridges in to recycle. There is a limit based on whether you are a regular customer or a premier customer. She did not know which I was from my account information and was unwilling to figure it out. So rather than make two trips to return the cartridges that I had I would need to make four. She insisted so I asked for a manager who confirmed that I was a premier and allowed me to recycle the 20 that I wanted to. This lovely young lady then informed me after the manager left that "It's okay, you got your chirps in.". Yeah, after the manager left she disrespected me straight to my face. I will never again go into this store unless I'm desperate. Rating is changed to a one star from the original 3.   ORIGINAL REVIEW:I only stop in here when I absolutely cannot wait for a delivery.  The staff working the registers is super slow.  I always leave there more than a little frustrated.  Selection isn't so bad but they keep moving things around the store so it can be hard to find whatever it is you're looking for :/<//text>

Called them in advance to check the inventory. Got a confirmation that that yes - they have that one item in stock. Asked them to reserve it under my name.
When I arrived in 30 min - I did not like place at all. It's hard to drive into the parking lot - only one entrance and it's fenced from nearby Home Depot parking lot.
When I walked in - I asked about the product and mentioned that called and reserved it.
Got a "I don't know what are you talking about" face in response.
Then talked to a manager on duty - she confirmed that they have that product in stock and disappeared in the back of the store with one of the CS guys.
About 10 minutes later that guy walked out and said that they don't have that product in stock. - "What????!!!"
When I asked to talk to a Manager - that guy disappeared.
After waiting for another 10 minutes - I called Stapes customer care and filed complaint. Lady on the phone put me on hold and called the store - then that guy walked out and stared to lie to me again that manager is trying to find me a product, blah-blah-blah.
In the end I waited for more than 30 min, but still was not able to talk to a store manager on duty.
Not sure what actually happened to that item I reserved. Whether they have issues with inventory system, or they just sold that product to someone and refused to acknowledge it.

My advice to everyone - don't call that store, don't buy from them - you will get a bad service, even if you will like to complain - you will not be able to talk to a manager, because he/she will hide in the back of the store.< /text>

Very poor customer service. I waited at a register to check out while the associates where standing around talking. One associate saw me finally but then acted like it was a chore for him to ring me up. His name was Eric and he was very unpleasant. He even threw my chane down on the counter rather than handing it to me. I told him to have a good evening and he just rolled his eyes, and said whatever. I immediately returned my purchase, asked for a manager however he never came. I got my money back and left. I will not revisit this location ever again. The Staples in Fremont is more appreciative for my business.< /text>

One of those places that spends all their time dealing with their internal processes and no time with customers. If someone has a return the entire staff seems to get consumed with sorting out the "right" way of handling it. If you're talking to someone and the phone rings get ready to wait - because phone calls are more important than you. Then after all these frustrations when you check out the hard sell on "insurance" kicks in, then the "Rewards Program" pitch.< /review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Let me start out by say I lived a hard knocks life. I never had any one to trust or rely on. I started coming to staples and start up my own construction business. I’m collecting unemployment rite now because I have had a skin condition for 6 years and stress truly can kill someone, I was dying. So I’m trying to focus on my health. Try and use my money and time as wisely as possible. TOO REMINEND YOU ALL , THIS IS A POLITICOLY CORRECT STATE. So every complaint I’m saying I can and will sue staples for. There is a staples suck website for a reason and I’ll explain fully in how and why they do and how I should own staples. I have been coming in and out of the one in Campbell off Hamilton. I came in and went got a coin counting machine. I also plan on getting into the bar and club business, “sorry I like to have fun but not for how much it cost. I like to buy everyone rounds, and talk”. When I got home I plugged the unit in and it did not light up, I read a litlle up on it and pressed a couple of buttons, still nothing so I put maybe ten coins in the unit and it still did nothing I tried taking out the cleaner tray and that would not open I went back to the store a couple of days later and returned it the young white manager that just got out of high school and also has been picked on, I can see he has major insecurities. I’ll explain, he was looking up my receipt because the managers are the only ones that can, 5 minutes later he still could not find it. I already knew how smart the register clerk is and I basically told him that the kid behind him would be better at his job. Well I saw a bunch of smirk and grins so I knew he did not know  how to do his job at all. And that he lives a lie. That the car he drives was on a loan, when we went got the other unit on the shelf. He had that smirk again when I said I’m going to fire him if he don’t start managing it right. I REMEMBER BEING that young, He has his head so far stuck up his ass that he thinks he’s better and smarter then everyone because he knows how to abuse them mentally. And work for nothing to make him look good and also goes with the other white boy managers. I am just calling it as I see it, when it is all going on. They are working together like a pack of dogs. So they can grow together. That I say is racist they don’t know each other, only by color. I AM HALF WHITE AND ASAIN. I HAVE MORE WHITE FRIENDS THEN I DO ASAIN. I asked to plug it in and see if in before I leave again. TIME IS MONEY AND THEY ARE WAISTING MY TIME. I saw that this one also did not have a plastic bag covering it or even in the box. So then he tells me that its fine and good to go. So I said</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I am coming up on two years next month.  Let me first start off by saying that I have no Issues whatsoever with the staff, everyone there is great!  Denise, Lourdes and the Maintenance supervisor George are amazing!  The apartment is nice I have enjoyed living here for the most part.  My issues lie with  a handful of residents.  It is absolutely true that some of the neighbors are loud and obnoxious without regard to their neighbors.  So the people that are saying its quiet must be super  heavy sleepers.  It also depends on the side of the complex you stay on.  They have security that hides in the building where the gym in and barely secures the perimeter.  Where I stay people will come between Building C and D and are often outside playing music , talking loud and fighting at 2 and 3 am .  I NEVER see the security guard come over to that area and you would think if he was actually doing his job he would be on top of it. Sadly that is not the case.  I feel like if the security and the residents were held accountable for their actions then it would be so much better.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Maintenance always does a good job keeping the landscape nice. I love all the trees, plants and grass. Any time a laundry machine breaks they are quick to fix it. The gym and the pool kept clean and go through routine checks. The playground and seasonal activities organized by management are a lot of fun for the kiddos. The one improvement could be in better security, like hiring security guards. Overall a very nice place.</review><Response>{'time': 1589804890744, 'text': "Thank you for leaving your feedback for Mountain Vista Apartments.

Management is terrible they refuse to handle any disputes. They really don’t give any type of care for what goes on to you or altercation you have in a unit. It’s unfair un just and quiet stubborn we live here to be safe and to be at peace and nobody gonna manage to keep that peace I live here and I’m terrified to come out. And the previous resident living where I’m living still has the keys the unit  and at any moment he can come Into my unit and steal Whatever they please. I wish you guys had a better way to handle things like this instead of telling other to go to court this is your guys facility.<//Text>

I had left a 4 star review before. Sadly I have to lower it to 1 star.

This place has become very filthy,  there is trash everywhere,  it smells bad, the laundry room is a disaster now and I've heard from people that someone is braking into cars.

Very disappointing</review>

Hubby and I have been living here for almost two years now and from the first time we came in everything has been great. Staff is great they are always doing their best to help when times get tough if it's within their means. and maintenance is awesome. I have no complaints they are always improving their property and looking for ways to make the residents happy. I would recommend living here!< /Text>

< Review>
Not worth the rent.Bad kids and youth running around late night. Weed smoking and drug selling out of units the office doesn't provide good security. First day I moved in some dude asked if I wanted to buy weed.Only good thing is location to mall and freeway. Junk cars in parking lot on cinder block slabs. Seems that section 8 has taken over.. ghetto people and the guest they have.. doesn't feel much like home folks don't have respect for hard working people.
Super ghetto a mess rude residents the kids are bad and the parent aren't much better and loud music at the pool no peace and quiet. I work to hard and long hours and come home to these ghetto neighbors they dump beds and there whole apartment in the dumpsters sometimes it doesn't seem safe I don't enjoy living here and can't wait to move, this really use to be a peaceful and enjoyable place to live. They set pool rules yet don't enforce them children are out on the playground late night and folks just hang out and smoke weed under the picnic shelter. It's a lawless community. Loud and ghetto is all I can say this is what happens when section 8 moves in not everyone takes  pride in being a good neighbor and treat people good and respecting the community. This place is a zoo and the office doesn't care just as long as you pay your rent they get there money and the Hell with solving any problems or making the complex a happy and safe and enjoyable place to live for everyone.. Guess someone will have to get shot or hurt before they take things seriously some of these people are violent and it shows in how they react and respond to each other night time gets crazy in this human zoo..I wouldn't tell anybody to move here unless you need to be close to the mall or freeway those are about the best things they offer the location is perfect that's about all..😔🤔</Review>

Pretty nice place to live.  We chose it because of the beautiful mature trees and nice looking
grounds.  This is a rarity in the desert so that looking out our window it seems more like living in the mountains rather than the sparse desert.  Management is good. Just wish they would crack down more on noisy neighbors.  But other than that they keep up the grounds well and the maintenance staff are top notch.<//Text>

<Review>ALL these negative reviews are accurate. ALL of management is poorly trained. These apartments are not only unprofessional but very petty. My husband & I were excited for our 1st experience of moving in together but after this, they made our whole experience DISAPPOINTING. We were not only screwed over by them giving the apartment away that we were told would be on hold for us due to the inconvenience of the prev tenant cancelling on our first apt, but they lied to us MULTIPLE times on when we'd get our deposit back.
3x they told us "your money should be back in your account tomorrow". 3 weeks later & nothing. We were more than patient & polite, every time we'd call they never knew what to tell us. They would never reach out to us. Until we got tired of 3 weeks of lies.. My husband had to call corporate only for them to cover up their lies by "we barely sent the check out yesterday" AFTER 2 1/2 weeks?! The apartments are nice, decent. But save yourself the headache & hassle. I would never recommend these ESPECIALLY for first timers.< /Review>< time>

So much negative stuff to say about this place! Section 8 has taken over and people who actually PAY 1,250/Month are being completely overlooked. Why should we have to pay for a place that has literally become free government housing? It's just kind of messed up that we pay that much to deal with CRIME, GANG ACTIVITY, CONSTANT POLICE RAIDS, SECURITY THAT ISN'T ALLOWED TO DO THERE JOB, AND OVERLY NOSEY MANAGERS  IN EVERYONES BUSINESS. I had friends get attacked while getting their mail and one of them was pistol whipped! They were robbed for 1000's of dollars of stuff! Also I've heard of an old lady getting stabbed to death, and shootings, I don't walk outside at night without pepper spray or a taser. ALSO, the newish manager Theresa is a busy body who calls the cops on everyone just for minor things and a coward. She literally hides in the back when I go in the office and won't talk to me! Honestly all the problems seem like they get way worse  when she was hired. PLEASE DON'T MOVE HERE IF YOU HAVE KIDS! NOT SAFE!<//text>

< review>
I lived here for a year. Paid everything I owed. A year after moving out I got a notice from a debt collector that my last payment was still owed. That I had already paid a year ago! Before it was due! So now I have to deal with the false report to a debt collector while trying to get approved for a mortgage. Should have expected it bases on the terrible experience of living there.< /review>

Everyone in the office, Security and Staff are all friendly and professional. My neighbors are quiet and friendly. I don't see any of these other reviews that are negative to be true. Very family oriented. Love how involved the management is. From BBQ's to Kona Ice visits. I highly reccomend this complex.</review>< pics>

<Text>My husband and I lived here for 3 years and were quite happy.  The staff were always helpful and kind.  Any problems in the apartment were dealt with VERY quickly.  While there are always those careless folks who leave trash or make a mess, the grounds were well-maintained and cleaned regularly.  I never felt unsafe but still appreciated increased safety measures, such as the installation of additional bright lighting in the parking lots.  It's not the most amazing place ever, but I have no reservations about recommending this complex.

I look at other reviews and am truly perplexed.  I cannot believe that we are speaking of the same place.<//Text>< username>

Recently seen the Manager stalking someone’s Apartment in her white vehicle as I was sitting in my vehicle in the parking lot. I Quite often hear that the manager can be racist at times with African Americans. They pick on a lot of good individuals. I just suggest that the people that are being picked on be very careful because they will evict you.</Text>

Moved in over 5 years ago. Nice neighborhood, local to much of the city. Staff is always friendly(Holly), and understanding when times are tough. Clientele has taken a turn for the worst in recent years...perhaps better background checks. Facilities are cleaned, though people continue to trash areas(laundry: use liquid soap morons) To previous poster about roaches...maybe your cleanliness was the problem.< /text>

<Text>Again if I could give this place 0 stars I would. I originally left a review under 4Marvelkids but something happened today that prompted me to update my experience so that folks looking to move here can have a real in the moment accounting of what its like to live here. I've tried talking to these people civily and it went nowhere so I will voice my experience here for those who may be looking to move here.

My issue is namely the level of petty the management here will stoop to. After my original complaint of being charged $250 for a mistake my family didnt cause I was informed they would be waiving that fee via email and we scheduled for them to repair my tub. I thought, good, someone is owning the fact that a mistake was made and trying to rectify the issue I was trying to resolve without having to butt heads with folks I felt I could count on at one point.

Today I went to my daughters graduation and then took her to BJ's for brunch. In the meantime I had my 11 year old pick up a package that I had my sister send to me for our business. When i return home from brunch my 11year old informs me the office said we can no longer receive packages if my name isn't on it (because my sister purchased it her name was on it). MIND YOU, we have in the past SEVERAL TIMES, but I guess when you refuse to accept being pushed around by management they try and find other ways to get back at you. The level of petty I'm experienceing right now is ridiculous, but hey, I'm a fighter, so lets go. So glad to be moving once my lease is up in August. I'm literally counting down the days like its Christmas. Although, we'll see what trumped up charges they try to charge me with when we leave. That's how petty these people are. Until then i will continue to update because this is the most ridiculous and unprofessional experience I have ever had with renting an apt. and I want others to be aware of what they are getting themselves into. I'm astounded right now. I'm not even going to waste my breath trying to talk to these poeple because lets be honest, they don't care. I'm just a unit number to them.

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>BEWARE! I've lived there for a while now and my lease is up next month and I honestly cannot wait to be completely moved out! Worst customer service I've ever experienced and the neighborhood is horrible! I've made noise complaints because our neighbors love to blast music at 2 am and also, most of our neighbors smoke pot and the smoke gets into our apartment. Management is aware and won't do anything about it even though I have a toddler in my home. All they care about is their money. They scammed me into paying more than what everyone else pays because they made me believe our apartment was "remodeled". But when we moved in, our counter had cigarette burns. We told the office and they agreed to fix that within a couple days. When we called back after not hearing from them in over a week, they refused to replace the countertop because it was "too expensive to replace". We have been going through so much in our personal life, my husband and I, that it conflicted with our rent being paid on time for 2 months. We explained our situation to the office and they agreed to not charge us a late fee. The second month, they decided to go back on their word and charged us 2 late fees for the past month and the current month.
The pools were filthy and when we moved in, they told us that the water was temperature controlled but turned out: they ARE but they "didn't work" and aren't planning to fix them. My car was vandalized in the parking lot even though they have an "on duty security guard" and when my husband requested a new parking spot because of that incident, they refused. Even though there's more than 30 un assigned parking spots.
It's just so sad that they expect their tenants to be happy and extend their leases when they don't care for them! If you ever see a camera, don't think they work because they don't! It's just for decoration. They admitted that they aren't in use and don't plan on fixing them. They can't sympathize with our situation ( me losing my job and losing my grandfather all in the same month) and it breaks my heart that I call this place HOME but I'm being neglected and lied to living there. BEWARE! They smile in your face but when the going gets tough, they would rather get rid of you than work with you... I'm GRATEFUL I'm out next month!</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Stay away! Especially if you don't know your rights as a tenant and the legal protocal landlords are supposed to follow which this place does not. Wendy (financial administrator) thinks she owns the place and acts like it.

The maintenance staff was nice despite 3 seperate attempts to fix our front door that had a huge gap where weather stripping was supposed to be. Several fellow tenants were especially helpful and friendly, giving us advice for our situation and even assisting with getting our fridge up 2 flights of awkward stairs when we first moved in. Our original rent was roughly 995 month. 6 months later and prices in Victorville, Hesperia and Apple Valley have shot up tremendously... Our apartment is now being charged 1100 a month. This place is a revolving door of tenants and our rental was surrounded by empty ones after only being there 2 months.

The financial administrator refused to work with us when we were late on a month's rent even though we'd presented all of it along with the offer to pay any other late fees in installments. It's actually illegal for the administrator to do this and the office is supposed to provide detailed information about the actual owners of the complex because they are the ones tenants need to meet with to discuss payments. Everyone I've spoken to has said that it's extremely fishy that the owner's contact information isn't provided and that they have no right to charge for so many different things and not allow any negotiating. The financial administrator will be more than happy to tell you to pay up or get out in the middle of your court case as well so don't even bother trying to fight it, just stall so you get more time to move out. And if you happen to forget something in your rush to move out, you'll have to fork over another $700 just to get back in to retrieve it.

There's also been drug activity, assaults, thefts and a child kidnapping just within the past year here. So if the above wasn't convincing enough, maybe this tidbit will do it.

Edit: Aaaaand to add insult to injury, they will withold your proof of residency which other potential landlords need before they can approve you to get into a new residence after escaping this place. Thanks for the extra slap in the face Mountain Vista!

Edit#2: Aaaaand now my family is homeless and unable to get any kind of housing because of the inflexibility of Mountain Vista Apts management and a stigma on all of our names because we had to all sign the damn lease, so no one will even consider us now... all that's left is for us to kill ourselves I guess.</Text>

MUST GO: amazing staff, delicious food, great experience!!
We spontaneously decided to come on a busy weekday and got a table quickly outside. The food was delicious, fresh and came out quickly. The staff was attentive, friendly and ensured we had a great time. There was a small hiccup with the kitchen bringing is the wrong dish though the chef came outside to personally apologize and offer drinks and dessert on the house. Overall probably one of the best customer service experience in San Francisco.
Extra points: our husky was welcome and received special attention and water refills.< /Review>

Excellent choice for getting back to exploring the city.  Spacious rustic main dining room on a corner.  Successful blend of Basque roots and California ingredients.  Some day the cable cars will run again but for now it’s just as charming.< /Review>

This place is renovated on the basis of a traditional Spanish restaurant and turns into a modernized Spanish place. The presentation looks great, size is delicate, taste is superb and the ingredients are absolutely in the high quality. Hurry up to be here before it becomes another Michelin-Starred restaurant. So far, it does not serve tasting menu, but I definitely recommend the chef of the cuisine to develop one in the near future.<//Text>

<text>Such a gem!! We went hear for my birthday dinner and the food was incredible. Every dish amazing in its own right. Lived in Spain for years and this paella was better than any paella I ate in Spain! Also very COVID friendly outdoor seating with ample space and heat lamps. Owner was lovely too! Can’t wait to go back here.</text>< Pictures>

IMPIRTANT: there's a pop-up taqueria serving lunch most days of the week in Abrazo, called Miguelito. It's very good for take away or dining in via their outdoor tables.< /Review>

<Text>Appetizers, entrees and dessert were very tasty.

Atmosphere was nice especially when more people showed. We arrived in the earlier side to see a show later.

Good for couple night or larger groups and celebrations.

Gave it four stars because the service was just ok. I guess I’m used to slower service in Spain but this is SF so was a bit surprised. Service people were nice though.< /Text>< Response>

<review>Zarzuela was warm and inviting and practically impossible to replace. Abrazo means to embrace and this place does not do that- it is cold and uninviting. They should let the wonderful Spanish memories go with Zarzuela and start from scratch. I’m not sure what this place is trying to be. They are charging $5 (!!!) for bread- a staple in any Spanish restaurant. We ordered the Gambas, which were the highlight of the meal, except one of the best parts of Gambas is dipping bread in the sauce, and they don’t serve it with bread, so yup, $5 more for bread. The lightly fried vegetables were basically tempura (why?!). The polpo was okay but served with rock hard potatoes. And the paella... just does a disservice to the name. My boyfriend referred to it as “soupy hard rice”. And it came with 1 shrimp. Just 1. At one point we joked we wanted more bread, and they brought it out and charged us another $5! I hope they take a hard look at what they’re doing here and try a new approach. So sad for this iconic corner.</review><user>114518995515877386070< /user><username>Vicky Brodsky<//username>< Response>

<review>Omg we love this place! Been several times for special occasions: NYE, birthdays, anniversaries, Elton John ;) you name it, if we’re in the city celebrating we’re usually having dinner at Abrazo first. We love the rich flavors of the food, the fabulous wine selection, and the Spanish-style cuisine takes us back to our honeymoon in Spain. We always get the grilled Octopus, meatballs and Paella. Also delicious: the chicken, pork tenderloin and lamb shank.
Abrazo is always our go to to impress people, and it never disappoints- in fact, it has become a go-to for friends we introduced to the restaurant to entertain their friends and family!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5</rating>< date>

So good!  Great food,  great service.  The apps were exceptional and my entree,  Pork Tenderloin, was on point.  We were with a group of 8 and they accommodated us no problem.  The noise level was perfect for casual conversation.  We were unfamiliar with the wines so we asked the waiter for a recommendation, and after a few questions on our tastes we got a great bottle!  Def coming back for a date with the wife.< /Text>

They haven't been doing Sunday brunch very long but do yourself a favor and check it out! Everything was delicious. Some innovative approaches on the menu, along with delicious things like house made chorizo and lamb bacon, but hearty and satisfying too. A really good blend of fresh flavors with a satisfying brunch concept, with the Spanish overall theme weighing in but not dominating. A great bottle of cava for $40. Really enjoyed every bite and sip and set our Sunday up perfectly.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Three of us visited this new restaurant tonight. There were so many interesting things on the menu we couldn’t decide what to try so decided to share. We ordered three small plates, a salad, and paella. Every single thing we tried was exciting and delicious. Though this restaurant is taking over the space of a beloved Spanish restaurant, Abrazo is really California/Mediterranean and should not be compared to Zarzuela. Where Zarzuela was homey and familiar, this is surprising and sophisticated.  We will certainly be back and we are happy about this wonderful addition to the neighborhood.<//review>< pictures>

<text>Fantastic food and great service!  This is my 5th time here ( once for Sunday brunch). Beautiful, cozy room on Russian Hill ( 2000 Hyde St ). For starters we had the meatballs, beet cured salmon, charred octopus and roasted carrots - all excellent and well portioned.
For our main courses we had the Seafood paella, lamb shank (to die for) and roasted chicken ( best in the City ). Although we were stuffed we couldn't resist 2 desserts. We went with the dulce de leche and the churros, topped off a perfect evening. Chef Micheal Pawlik paid our table a visit and could not have been a more gracious host. If you are in Russian Hill and are looking for a great meal Abrazo is a MUST!</text><UserId.>113189058242923568437<//UserId.><username>brian gates< /username></record>

WOW - what a wonderful experience at this new Russian Hill restaurant in the former location  of Zarzuela. We are so impressed with the wonderful food and the amazing service . From the moment we walked in we loved everything, the classy old world wood tables and  wood ceiling beams and Spanish atmosphere .
The dishes were exceptional- the lamb shank dish was bursting with flavor and the meat falling off the bone . The churros and Icecreaam dessert was WOW and French Press coffee style  a great touch . We look forward to many more dinners at this new charming Russian Hill gem .< /review>

The atmosphere and service make this an excellent spot for date night, or to share a fun evening out with a group of friends. You can’t go wrong. The wine list is fun and unique. You must try the meatballs, croquetas, and octopus to start. The lamb shank and “Pollo con Pisto” are exquisite (for all you that remember Chef Mike from his days at Frascati, nobody makes a better chicken in SF).
A true neighborhood gem! Get there...</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Where do I start, I know, the meatballs. Beef and duck meat meatballs. With an amazing onion jam on top of each one!!! The chicken and jamon croquetas are an excellent second option. The slighty fried vegetables had an amazing roasted red pepper sauce served with them. The steak has a great seasoning rub. Saw the lamb shank on the table next to me and I wanted that too. Bring on the moscatel dessert wine with the vanilla bean ice cream!< /Review>

This spot is my favorite. I eat in plenty of restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The crew is very receptive and the food they place on your table is so tasty. I would always prefer to have a decent dinner in this place. I highly recommend this place.<//Text>

Sorry but can’t recommend this place. Takeout was over-cooked and meat had obviously been sitting for a while. Good Thai food is fresh and vibrant, sadly this was anything but. Red chicken curry bland</text>

Delicious food, ordered prawn shrimps (6/7 wrapped shrimp and bacon with wrap and deep fried), calamari, angel wings, red curry, shrimp fried rice, chicken meatballs, garlic noodles, papaya salad, and thai tea.  Very nice service. Lots of seating available at 1pm on a Saturday.</review>

< Review>
AWFUL SERVICE. My fiance went called to order their house chicken fried rice and tried adding beef and pork, and the guy on the phone was like "no. I dont think so. We don't want to. Maybe a different time". And then finally was able to get the order in, he said it would be ready in 15 minutes, and it's been over an hour, and my fiance waited to pay for his food after seeing his order on the table, and the man looked over at him, ignored him, and  then still sat there on his phone, even after prompts from my fiance.<//Review>

The owners and staff are very sweet and the food is actually pretty good. The reason they get two stars is because they do not read orders and always give the wrong dish. They put eggs in when I asked for no eggs, tofu in three separate dishes when I asked for no tofu, and seafood in a vegetarian noodle dish that they promised was actually vegetarian after they messed that last one up. They need to pay attention and READ orders.</text>

<Text>Love the Food. Fresh, hot an very flavorful. A little slow,  but no 5 ☆ cause just too many flies buzzing around. Not squeamish,  just to bothersome. But the food is so delicious,  gets eaten quickly:)<//Text>< pics>

Well, all my family has been here. We come often and this place is the best Thai in town. I want to the Thai pot too but I have to say that the flavor there aren’t as great as here at the sukhothai. The green curry is my favorite and the sweet potato appetizer is amazing. I will recommend it to everyone! The stuff is also sweet and they remember us and greet us with joy every time we come. Totally love it!< /Review>

First time here and very impressed. Very flavorful Thai food with excellent service, located near Safeway in Sebastopol, ca. There are many items on the menu that are not commonly found in mainstream Thai restaurants, which is very refreshing. Nice and clean ambience, fresh flower on each table. Owner is very accommodating to our inquiries. We shall return to try different dishes.
My wish list: I would like to see coconut sticky rice paired up with coconut ice cream instead of vanilla ice cream.<//text>

Authentic leaning Thai. Super awesome addition for Sebastopol. Not quite as good as Tiny Thai in Cotati. But my new local go to for take out. Dining in atmosphere less so. Super solid pad Thai and green curry. Very reasonably priced.< /Review>

I am still here as I type this. It's so good I couldn't wait to tell everyone. The drunken noodle and the Panang curry were so robust in flavor, by far the best I've had in Sonoma County. The Choo Cee salmon sang. In all three dishes the vegetables remained crispy in the amazing sauces.

Lastly our waiter was amazing. We can't wait to go back!</review><GmapID>0x80843a0ae32d8939:0x3ea1800bf73025c6</GmapID><rating>5<//rating>< date>

Great stop for a local feel.  I didn't speak Spanish but they did have a friendly chap that was able to take my order.  Fast and quick and was very delicious.  Salsa was nice and had some heat to it.  Would definitely eat here again.</Text>

Good tasty food the only problem l have is the flour tortillas, either they gotta make'em thinner or cook them all the way through, because of their thickness they have some raw areas that aren't cooked fully through. But other than that the food is good<//review>

Great tasting carne asada! I had the very well served burrito, and my son had four, flour tortilla tacos. Aguas frescas, Jamaica, and Horchata were delicious! My wife had the oatmeal, and she loved it!!! Great little "hole in the wall" place!!!< /text>

<review>First and last time I frequent this so-called restaurant. Service was terrible. The plate we ordered was less than satisfactory to say the least. When I brought it to the attention of the supposed owner,  instead of at least offering a discount totally disregarded me and with a smug smirk said I still needed to pay him. I'm giving this hole in the wall a very generous one-star.</review>< Time>

Not authentic. Disgusting. Seriously considering calling the Health Department.
Customer service; horrible, food has no flavor and "guacamole" came from a bottle. How this place even has a star let alone 4.3 is surprising. I ordered a carne asada burrito and a carne asada taco. Taco barely had any meat and the refried beans from the burrito must have come from a can. Extremely disappointed. Ever since moving from SD finding decent tasting food has been a struggle. Can't even rely on the ratings on most of the places here in Brawley.
Even to pay for the food was difficult. The cook was on his phone the whole time. I had to ask if the transaction was over, he completely ignored me ... Mind you that I was with my wife and baby and never once was rude
It's sad and it's no wonder why we are constantly told to just go Mexicali< /text>

<Text>*Please like and have a nice day!

This is a great place to stop for a quick bite or drink off the 20/101 in Willits, Ca.

The staff are all very easy to communicate with, efficient and friendly.

The restaurant is clean, bathrooms are available and clean.

The parking lot is small but there's always room to park.

We usually stop here for cold drinks and ice or a taco or two. It's always been a pleasant experience each time and I figure we will continue to stop here when in the area.

There's 3 gas stations at each corner so it's easy to eat and fuel up. Safeway is across the street too.< /Text>< user_id>

Employee who took our order was annoyed and short with us and our order was wrong.   Didn't care to get it corrected because i didn't feel like engaging with said employee again.  Another employee came into the location coughing furiously, obviously sick.   She should not have been working or entering the establishment considering the pandemic.</Text>

So I love jack in the box but the employees here need to be worked on because someone bought my boyfriend and I two burgers and we ended up getting two breakfast sandwiches, last night we ordered 2 burgers, 2 curly fries, and a popcorn chicken half regular half spicy. We got it all the way home (we do not live in willits) and the popcorn chicken wasn't even there. Now I know you should always check the bag before leaving but I feel like I shouldn't really have to. PLEASE have a word with your workers, I would love to keep coming to this location but I don't know if I want to after that. Also whatever lady was working last night (April/ 18/ 2021) was so extremely rude, she is scaring the customers.< /review>

<Text>So I guess you're allowed to just not wear masks when you're serving people food during a pandemic, and also serve people raw undercooked egg in their breakfast burrito. Its always something. This place needs to get shut down. Next time im reporting this restaurant to the health department.<//Text>< pictures>

Yum Yum oh Yum Siri so I was driving back turned out to San Francisco in Idaho craving for a milkshake and I like to try all the different milkshakes available and about if I was Jack-in-the-Box Jack-in-the-Box and ordered a handspun milkshake regular tires because the live site has 1000 cal calories for me given me two mediums and ranch and ranch with the curly fries and when the curly fries came out they were very hot him I tried to eat one right away and it was hot and I almost burned my mouth so be careful when you get curly fries the milkshake had a lot of cream on it and you got to be careful with cream because you might accidentally cream yourself which is when you put cream all over yourself accidentally so be careful of that one thing I liked about this Jack-in-the-Box location more than the Jack-in-the-Box I went to for breakfast is that the man on the microphone took my order was very responsive even though the car in front of us had a lot of orders came up pretty fast yeah but I would recommend this Jack-in-the-Box four stars< /Review>

The manager of this place shouldn’t even be a manager, lots of food is wasted when it could be donated to homeless families. The employees are treated poorly and unfairly and are blamed for everything when the manager is the one giving them direction, they just follow it. Get a better manager, stop mistreating employees, and stop wasting food.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Over the last few months every time I place an order things are either forgotten entirely, orders are messed up completely, and worst yet the food is cold, again once in awhile things happen but for every single order to come out so messed up is inexcusable. I'm sorry but I won't be going back for quite some time. Its unfortunate because the crew always puts on a happy demeanor and is nothing but kind and people could really use jobs during this crisis but something needs to change if they want to remain open.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1596814569549, 'text': 'This is definitely not the impression we want to leave, Amber.

(Nightcrew) Have gone 5 different times, 2 of which they were closed well before the times the establishment had posted officially, the other 3 times their milkshake machine was cleaned too early or conveniently out regardless THE LAST TIME we got two sandwiches, cheese not melted and the chicken sandwich was cold to the touch. Seems like they make sandwiches hours before and hand them out. Funny how people are desperate for jobs during covid-19 and there are countless bad reviews about this location. Maybe a complete overhaul needs to be done but I doubt the standards will rise and or the manager will react to a google review</review>

This place is horrible at night. Tried literally 5 different times to get a shake and they either closed early, said they were out, and tonight I asked and they said they had already cleaned  the machine and when i pulled up to the drive through to pay for my food (which was cold and the cheese wasnt even melted) I saw that the shake machine was not in fact clean. Ridiculous. I wont be going back again ever. Really disappointing to see such a low standard at this location.< /review>

The burgers were not fresh. Tasted like they sat around for awhile. The curly fries seemed like they were fried 2x. I love Jack in the Box on occasion. I just won't visit this location again. The staff was super nice and the restaurant was really clean.< /Review>

<Review>We recently tried their Spicy Chicken Tenders and they were really good. Their Spicy chicken sandwich and curl fried were good as usual.
They introduced the app for ordering but it seems like it is available only for few locations. They also need to upgrade their payment methods to start accepting Apple/Google pay. Happened to me a couple of times that I forgot my wallet and because of lack of mobile payments and app ordering not enabled through out locations, I wasn't able to order.</Review><time>1557864297612< /time>< name>

The food itself isn't terrible, but they never have enough people working. The people who are there are expected to do far too much. I don't think the mistakes such as missing food or getting your order wrong is even the fault of the employees, their just short staffed.

Only come here for late-night food, and only because their is no other choice.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1561750817922, 'text': "We're sorry to hear you did not have a great time with us, Matt.

Ordered I simple combo, no sauce on the burger. They realized they messed up the order before I was out of the drive through, they gave me someone's tacos instead of fries. Get home to realize theres bacon mayo in the burger, so I drive back to get a new one. The replacement was missing a bun. Cannot believe they got it wrong 3 times on one order... 2 stars because the staff didnt ask any questions and tried their best to not waste my time.< /Review>

<text>Linda is one of the kindest, most selfless people I have ever met. She's proof angels walk among us. Her presence is a grace to this jack in the box, she should be making 40$ an hour, and if she's not, she deserves a raise! Thank you Linda, your kindness to us in this dark time was a completely unexpected relief. Thank you for getting us home safe. Oh, and she makes awesome tacos too. 💕</text>< rate>

The tomatoes were crunchy and not red. The ground beef Patty was like chewing rubber. The lettuce did not crunch, it was floppy. The onions were irregularly cut and not evenly placed on burger. The pickles had an off flavor to them, very sour...too much sauce made the bread soggy, all ice in the drink, fries too salty and nearly every single french fry had pointy tips and crunchy ends...nah...pass this place up, the service wasn't worth much either...I will not return. The one bite of each that I took , I spit out. Even my dogs turned their noses up at it! Blech!<//review>< Response>

I thought it was really "rude" to leave me waiting in drive thru to order for over 5 minutes.....so, when I got to the window, I asked for the manager. I asked him, "what is going on? There is noone in drive through, you have an employee playing on his phone. Why did we wait so long?" His reply, "he's on break and while you were being "rude", I was helping someone at the front counter.".....what?? I guess it is rude of me to expect them to actually take my order instead of leaving me staring at a board for over 5 minutes. I did not see any other customers there. So sorry to inconvenience you and try to buy something from your establishment. I will not bother you again!< /review>

This was our first visit to a Jack in the Box. We were not impressed so not likely there will be another stop. The service was extremely slow. The problem appeared to be the fry cook area. While we were waiting there were several mistakes with orders. The person in front of us ordered burgers and got chicken sandwiches. Our burgers were average at best. Nothing special about this place. Maybe they were having a bad day. The woman taking our order was friendly.</Review>

This one is in the same place as the Walmart. Ukiah. Very juicy burgers. My friend's at least 2 of them are the very nicest managers.night and day. And if you have a complaint fries cold. Or anything else they will give you a fresh order of the same. No questions.😍. My order was double bacon cheese . Fries and Large Dr pepper.< /review>

Not good meat at all, very bland and under-seasoned. Fries were a bit soggy, but still okay. If I go back, I'll probably try the Ranch Chicken club, or whatever its called.< /review>

There were no cars in the parking lot or in the Drive-Thru as I went through. Yet the drive-thru window cashier made me feel like I interrupted his lunch break or something. The food was hot though and it's always good because it's Jack in the Box< /text>

There were 3 cars ahead of me and it took 25 minutes to reach the window.  It took another 5 minutes to get my rice bowl and drink.  Slowest service ever.  The two stars was because the food was good.< /Text>

Food was decent, though lacking in burger size, with the exception of the kids meal cheese burger - it was practically the size of everyone else's burgers; my 6 yr old couldn't finish it. Service was quick and accurate.</review>

After waiting 15 minutes in drive thru, being parked and forced to wait 10 more minutes in the parking lot, they served my child RAW food! They then had the nerve to be rude and disrespectful when i complained. I will NEVER be back and actively detour anyone i know from ever eating here again. WORST RESTAURANT IN UKIAH! You're better off eating at the gas station next door!</review>

The food it's good but the customer service staff it takes a lot of time to help one customer, the manager, the one person who has to help out the employees, is no where to be found.

Other than that it's a great place to take a quick meal and get going on your trip.</review>

<Review>This is definitely one of the worst Jack in the boxes I've ever had.  I drive back and forth from Fort Bragg and Lakeport late at night. it's the only place open. the tacos are stale sometimes, the fries have been sitting to long. I asked them to take off tomatoes and put lettuce instead, and they charged me. no other JB has ever charged me. And that makes me even more Angry knowing that nothing else is open and I'm super hungry I have to eat there, nothing makes me more angry. and actully after i write this I won't stop there again. I've really had enough.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80819988e4eb8815:0x5d684062eb389f0d< /GmapID></record>

The entire staff had to be newbies, didn't know what the other workers were doing waited in line for 25 minutes, when I got to the window I asked if she would guarantee that it wouldn't be more than five minutes more, she couldn't so we left without purchasing the food we ordered and went to burger king, was in and out in five minutes< /Review>
