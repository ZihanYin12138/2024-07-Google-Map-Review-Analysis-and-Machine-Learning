we were not satisfied with the service they provided, one of the employees suggested to buy a new phone from store. We accepted but before paying we asked about return policy, the lady told that  in 2 weeks we can return the phone,nothing ELSE.
After few days worked with the new phone, we realized that it was not of good quality and also we found unlocked same phone online with less than half price.
Today we went to the store to return the phone and the manager  CARL told us there is $20 restocking fee ☹️we became very surprised .we told it is not right because there wasn't any sign in the store that explain about restocking fee.He told that It is in the recipe and customer can see it AFTER PAY .
It is store’s  responsibility to explain the full return policy not the part of it.
We asked CARL to call district manager and we need to talk with her/him but he didn't. 😧😧😧

I never recommend to go this store, Worst  customer service ever, I believe customers pay money to get service.< /text>< resp>

<text>The person helping me was scared to trade in my phone even though his manager said he could. When all was said and done, I felt incredibly and needlessly uncomfortable with the experience. Easily the worst tmobile instore experience I've ever had after over a decade with them.<//text><Gmap_id>0x808fcd080a45c63d:0x9ffdeb7089fead67</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

1. Bad customer service. I read some comments here, and i just experience the same.
2. Not professional. I told them my sim card is not working properly. I can only make phone call but no data service. They just tell me to replace the sim card without any testing. So they can make money.<//Review>

<review>WORST customer service ever. If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. I ordered a replacement phone for my husband, I called ahead of time to make sure it had arrived and was available for pick up and they told me yes. About an hour later we went in to pick up the phone and they would not release it because of a "system problem" and that they had to cancel my order. I then had to call the 1800 customer service number and place a new order with them. While we were waiting their was a man purchasing a Google pixel that was being advertised for $499, but when they rang him up they were trying to charge him $799, the man then told them that it was advertised at $499 and the person that was ringing him up told him "I don't care, it's $799 do you want it or not
" the man then asked him To speak to the manager and the tmobile employee just said he's busy. This is False Advertising on top off horrible customer service
I would not recommend this store whatsoever. The tmobile employee 's name that was "helping" us is Carl. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GOING TO THIS STORE.</review>< pics>

Spoke with Carl over the phone and he has no phone etiquette, no hi, no bye.  Just a shame because when we went at the store when we switched, we got excellent service by Maverick. I remember Carl as the guy who was walking around  the store with a mad face for the 2 hours we were there.< /Review>

<Review>The store manager (Chris) is the worst!! He needs to be fired. I received a bad costumer service from him, he acted if he was the CEO of the company. TMobile shouldn't have this type of people working. It does ruin the image of the company. It was my first time visiting this store and not going again.<//Review>< rating>

Love my President Trump, the real President</Name>
<Text>The store keeps changing the managers. For the previous managers promises some credits, such as give store's phone credit each month until the phone paid off, the new store manager Alexis denied all the promises and just simply saying she did not give the credit promises and I did not have writing on that promises, even the store's staff can prove that, and previous managers who are working at different location can verify that, but she does not try to help to listen to her staff in that store or to call previous mangers, so that she was very rude and yelling at me saying "I do not know the promises and I will not going you any credit". Beside above, the manager Alexis has very poor knowledge on T-mobile phone/network features. I am wondering how the person with such bad manner and poor knowledge can become a manager. Suggestion to you all, whatever the store saying something, ask them to write on piece of paper.</Text><userid>117589872527894286908<//userid>< Pics>

I called earlier in the day to ask a question about making a payment and also wanted to confirm the time the store would be closing. The lady I spoke with confirmed 9pm. I went in around 630 and stood in line to my dismay for 30 mins to never be acknowledged. I then proceeded to leave deciding maybe I should
come back a little before closing. Upon arrival at 840 pm I realized the doors were locked shutters were being put down. I knocked on the door and was greeted by a man whom identified himself as the store manager. I asked weren't they open til 9 ? He informed me that they were to close an hour early for a system upgrade. He informed me I should try going to their Story and King location. He also told me that he would give me a credit if I came back in the morning. I proceeded to tell him tomorrow would be too late and questioned him as to why they would confirm over the phone closing time was 9 when they ended up shutting down one hour early. He then proceeded to blame it on his boss. And again told me to go to the Story and King store. I went ahead and called the store located at Story and King to see if they were open. They answered and states they were open yet were also having a system update. By this time I asked him what kind of incompetent people do they have working here. What were the requirements for employment for the company?  Obviously it doesnt take much because these imbeciles are employed there.  This was my first and last time walking into this t mobile location no doubt. They should rethink whom is the most important person and keep employees better informed on things of this nature.<//text>

The store manager Curtis was on the register and every time when it was someone's turn and they wanted to pay their bill he would tell them ," you know you can pay online" and they would tell him ,no I like paying cash or in person. And he would responded with "wow okay" in a rude way. When it was my turn to pay I told him I wanted to pay my bill and as soon as I said that he turned to his worker and told him " man that's like the tenth bill pay in a row, it's getting me frustrated." At that point I just wanted to leave but I didn't have time to drive to another T-Mobile. I hope Curtis learns how to talk in front of customer, considering he's a "store manager".< /Text><Rate>1</Rate>< Pics>

This is the worse T Mobile store ever this girl didn't want to accept my note 7 back just because I didnt have the box with me. The manager Curtis was in no help what so ever. He tried to tell me the same thing when customer service didn't told me anything about the box not even the website says anything about it. Called customer service and they told me that I did not have to bring the box and that they should accept the phone.

Worst customer service ever.< /text>

Barely can get any help here. Probably an upper management issue because this store is severely understaffed, even during the middle of the day when there's hardly any customers. Don't feel like waiting an hour to get help.< /Text>

They just say call the phone support for everything. Not at all eager to help.</Review>

Today I signed up to get a haircut for my son with Rosie. The lady to her right told me I was next and I wasn't. Rosie had another client. I asked the lady to her right why she told me I was next and she didnt even apologize. I will never return. I also got my haircut there. She lost two customers and a bad review. Horrible customer service!< /review>

Horrible personal experience. The first and only time I have gone. Te wait was too long and the cut I got was embarrassing. I don't know if it was a first timer or if she just sucked. I had some short hair in places and long in other places. I had to get it fixed somewhere else.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I've been a patient of Dr. Cornehl now for over 10 years. The entire office is very good at what they do. They always have the latest technology and Dr. C is very conservative/thoughtful about his recommendations. They also clean your teeth perfectly! I've been dealing with TMJ for years and never thought there was a solution outside of a mouthguard. Even then, headaches still happen and you just deal with it. Dr. C mentioned botox as a helpful and useful solution. My friend told me about it and I was a bit nervous and scared, but once Dr. Cornehl explained how long it's been around and how effective it can be, I went for it. After a couple weeks of the injections, I noticed a HUGE improvement. Life changing. I no longer felt the tension in my neck or my head or jaw in the morning. I also was more aware of how much I used to clench my teeth and keep stress in my jaw muscles. Overall, would recommend this process to anyone looking for relief. It sounds crazy - botox for TMJ, but it works!<//Review>< pics>

I’ve always tolerated the dentist. This is the first time that  I Love going to see the dentist. The entire staff here is very friendly and thoughtful about the patients and their needs. I was slightly hesitant to see them during Covid, but after my visit, I feel very safe in the dentist chair. They go beyond any of the recommended health guidelines to ensure we are all kept safe. The same level of care by going above and beyond during this pandemic is what you get out of their health services. They really do everything they can to ensure your mouth is at its healthiest. I feel like when they are treating me, they do the same for me as they would do if they were treating a fellow dentist or their own family. If you need a new dentist, you should stop by and see what you’ve been missing</Text>

Dental Studio is the best dentist office I've ever been to and puts a lot of effort and care to ensuring people have a pleasant experience. They're also focused on protecting staff and patients against Covid-19 and I feel very safe every time I'm there.< /text>

If you are like me then you feel much better having the same doctor, dentist, optometrist etc and never want to change. When I moved to SF I had to give up my dentist that I had been seeing since I was a teenager. I am very particular about my teeth and wanted the best new dentist possible.</Review>

Dental Studio: So I just had my first dental experience in decades, and honestly it was great procedure. Dr. Fredrickson is an artist! Angie really kept me comfortable! I appreciate their professionalism and they really care about their patients! As I said it's been a long time. Since I was on thd chair and honestly I had my reservations buy Dental Studio SF truly has me feeling like I have nothing to fear! My recovery was a breeze! I attribute this to their excellent work!! I highly recommend them!< /Review>

Very modern dental office, super friendly dentists, and easy to schedule appointments. A little on the pricey side, but overall, very pleased with several services I've had at WSPD, including routine cleanings and filling replacements.<//Text>

The unprofessional lady at the front desk said It’s policy and she needed to talk to her manager ( ran back to do her sales tactic came back told me $100) I said no and she then attempted twice to charge my account.

I was excited to learn Dental Studio is taking appointments again after being closed for 3 months due to Covid. I wan't sure what to expect in this "new normal" but I felt completely comfortable and safe in the office. They are taking all the necessary precautions while still providing the best patient experience. Thank you for providing your services during this time Dr. Fredrickson!< /text>

Dental Studio is great, especially Dr. Frederickson! The whole staff is friendly, professional, and efficient. I felt super comfortable as they took the time to explain everything they were doing, and the office is super bright and clean. Highly recommend.< /Text>

Visited Dental Studio and had my regular teeth cleaning while I was living in San Francisco. They do a good job with the cleaning but how they operate and run their business is pure greedy and wrong. They would schedule your appointment every three months just to have you come back and said it was covered by insurance but never check with you about the specific and detailed insurance plan. After the three cleaning sessions in a 10month period, they send me a bill of two cleaning sessions that I am responsible for. They care zero for the patient interests rather than their own business revenue. Such place does not deserve to grow and last long with good business. Horrible! Do avoid coming in here and look elsewhere!</text>

<text>I have been coming to this office for around 10 years.  They are super friendly and do a fantastic job.  Both Laura and Flavia are absolutely fantastic.  They are great hygienists who really care about their patients and are just lovely people.  Dr. Cornehl is careful thoughtful and a great dentist who I really respect and trust.  The office space is lovely and a few chairs have views of Union Square.  Highly recommend.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Dr. Peter Fredrickson was a fantastic dentist! I was so nervous for my procedure and he explained everything so clearly and made me feel very calm. It was painless and I was so happy with the results!! The office is beautiful and has state of the art equipment and facilities. They clearly invest in the newest technology and care about their patients. So glad I went here!< /Review>

Awesome dentists and lovely hygienists who are super friendly and great at their job. Absolutely no pain or discomfort during cleaning. The view of the park is nice but the also have Netflix to watch during your appointment. They also use cool new technologies to look at your dental health and identify cavities.< /Review>

<text>This Dental Studio was suggested by a friend of mine. During my first visit, I was treated by Dr. Fredrickson, now Associate, who is a young but experienced professional. He suggested a treatment that I am doing, with excellent results so far.<//text>< user_name>

I have felt very supported and informed every step of the way, with his patient-centered style and individualized attention.  I'm so grateful to Dr. Fredrickson for his patience in taking the time to explain the procedures and give me time to ask questions,  fit me in quickly with a dental emergency, and working closely with my periodontist team. He's a delightful and thorough dentist and I highly recommend him.  Plus the office staff are super nice and organized, so there are never any financial surprises!

Staff is always friendly, happy, and knowledgeable. Atmosphere is relaxed yet professional. Nice little office conveniently located for those who work or live near downtown. I feel comfortable asking questions about dental hygiene and getting clear, helpful responses and explanations. And dental hygienist Laura is hilarious!!<//text>

The best dentist I have ever visited. Dr. Cornehl really goes above and beyond for his patients. Moreover, he has created a comfortable, beautiful dental office that is a pleasure to visit. (I never thought I'd write those words but they're true.) He's the only dentist I will visit now; I trust him very much.< /Text>

<review>Had a dental clean appointment, where Dr Cornehl recommended I get 4 fillings, fair enough. A couple weeks later, receive a difficult to understand insurance cost estimate, before my appointment -- I look through it carefully, determine that my copayment for the fillings will be ~$250.

I arrive at my appointment, and am told that my copayment is actually ~$1,000! Of course, these misunderstandings with insurance do happen, but after I decide not to go ahead with the appointment (wanting to do a little more cost comparison before I elect for this large bill), Dr Cornehl has the nerve to lecture me on the importance of planning ahead for such things. I'm sorry, if a patient who carefully reads a bill can't understand it because it is full of technical jargon and chooses to walk away for a $1000+ bill, is that the patient's fault? Not at all, and lecturing the patient is simply poor service.

Found another high-quality dentist who was willing to do the exact same fillings to fit under my insurance with $0 copay. Do your shopping around before you do any expensive work at this dentist's office.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808580892c23b87f:0x787034c3cb106612<//GmapID></record>

<Review>Professional team from Lisa at Front desk, who handles bookings & billing in thoughtful and professional manner. Maria - Dental Nurse is always smiling and great at her job but also caring & then Dr Cornehl, who always explains everything from treatment through post care and now in my 4th year of care in his hands - excellent. Lastly I need to mention Laura the excellent hygienist.</Review>< Pics>

<pics>None<//pics><text>For over a decade, I’ve experienced painfully tight facial muscles due to bruxism - teeth grinding and clenching. I use a mouth guard at night to protect my teeth, but have not had much relief from the constant discomfort. It feels like I have huge muscle knots in my face and even contributes to headaches and dizziness.
I found out that Dr Cornehl offers therapeutic  Botox injections and made an appointment. He explained the treatment and answered my questions. After the injections, I felt immediate relief and continued to feel better over the next few days. The effect will last 4-6 months. My facial tissue is much softer and my jaw isn’t clicking as often.
I had a recheck appointment today and I had a few small areas where the facial muscles were still feeling tight. Dr Cornehl treated me with trigger point therapy. I felt great after my appointment! I think that I will have an easier time sleeping without the constant pain, and I’ll feel better at work during the day.</text>< user>

Just went through drive through. They had us waiting without any information 💁‍♀️  after about 15 to 20 minutes I finally got to the pick up window. There was no communication or apology about our wait. I was handed my food and I said Thank you and there was no response. I just feel that when I'm getting a service that I'm paying for the least you can do is be polite.< /Text>

<review>Not great, whoever was taking orders on the drive thru, wasn't paying attention to them, this person was chatting with the customer previous me, when I got to place my order, she didn't put it on the screen, nor she told me my total to pay, when I got the pick up window, the person there told me my total was 7 something, I asked, 7 something for 6 tacos? And she asked me, what did you order, and I told her, 6 tacos, right there she just realized her coworker didn't take my order and that's when she barely put them in the system and told them to fry the tacos, I understand it's fast food, but they were not even on that level, they were not focused on their job.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Slow and rude at the counters, I get it's always packed but there's no need to get mad about me coming up to the counter for a burger I'm missing. Waited 45 in the drive thru, 20 minutes standing inside with nobody asking me if I needed anything, although everyone in the kitchen can see me. Took the girl 30 seconds to see the item still in the assembly line and claimed I left before they gave it to me. :// Do the drive thru cameras not show me circling around to the front of the store?? Never had a day like this before and hope to never again.</Review>

Messed up the order.  For my kids order they put jalapeños poppers instead of chicken nuggets. Then for the hamburger asked for no cheese.  They gave me cheese.  The tacos were cold and old.  Then when asked for corrective order.  The girl was real snobby giving dirty looks.  Didn’t even give me a receipt so I can call and complain. This new generation of kids don’t show any respect and very disrespectful.  They need to fire who is working today.  1-3-2021.  At 5:00 pm.<//Review>

So. I was just at jack in the box and they had given me the wrong order. I tried calling them multiple times. No answer. Also I asked for no ice in it and I made sure to ask again to put no ice in it. Also I asked for a southwest cheddar cheeseburger and they gave me a jumbo jack. I was really upset and just gave up. Didnt even want to go back. I really hope they get their staff together and fix this problem.<//text>

There's shake machine is always down they say that it needs to be fixed but I'm came to find out that they don't like to clean it laziness that's why I'm only giving it a two-star.they like to run shakes when it's convenient for them or have someone to clean it they try to say that the shake machine is broke.</text>

Went at about 12:45 am, After waiting about 2 minutes somebody finally responded saying all the employees are on break and we would have to wait 10 minutes, after driving around for about 15 minutes and came back to a line of cars of the drive thru So me and my father thought they were back but then we started to notice that all the cars were starting to drive off without ordering so when we got to the window the Same Employee said their system was down and to come back in 10-15 minutes and by that time we were tired and didn't want to wait anymore so we just went to the one San Juin Grade Road. Would give ZERO if possible.<//Text>

Husband and I decided to stop  at the drive thru we order jalapeños poppers (7) . We drove home to find out we going got 5.  Two of the jalapeños we burnt to a crisp and the  2 others had no cheese.
What a rip off!

And to top it off the girl didn't offer us a receipt.

Next time before driving off. Going to make sure the jalapeños are intact and no burnt jalapeño/chip!!</text>

I was there during my lunch. There was no one up in the front to take orders, I waited for about 8 minutes for someone to take my order. Also, I had to wait another qpcminutes for my food to be served. They were short on staff. Manager was out  chatting were customers eat. She saw me when I got there and did nothing untill I gave her a mad look. Really bad customer service.<//Text>

<Review>How do they manage to always mess up my orders? No clue but it happens. Not only that but most of the employees that are taking the order in Drive through give huge attitude. Especially, and I don't mean to be rude, but the gay big guy that's there in the night shift. Never went back even though its literally a couple blocks away. Wish I could give 0 stars.</Review>< Resp>

<review>Almost all sodas were out in the machine, very slow service and absolutely no napkins in the dispenser and not in my bag at all. Monster tacos had no cheese. An employee even grabbed sis from the machine and showed a look of disappointment but did nothing to rectify the lack of syrups.< /review>< date>

Not the business. I went around 11:00am and the person in the drive thru was extremely unprofessional and sounded like she didn't like her job. I was also charge $2.99 when I asked for some water. Just because I was in a hurry , I chose to continue with my night.<//Review>

Worst experience at this location. They had me and other customer waiting in the front counter while they fooled around in the back... also the food is always bad, they don’t take the time to actually put together a burger. I’ve been her a couple time and it’s always the same story...<//review>

<text>Upon your arrival, the staff always greats you. They are friendly and answer any questions or concerns that you may have. The dentist and dental assistant are kind and always ask if you're doing ok during any of the procedures. Dr. Tavakol reassures you that everything will be fine and if something hurts let her know and she will stop. She's attentive, patient, and kind. My experience has been great! Thank you.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Since the first time I came here I fell in love with this place. The entire staff is so friendly & helpful. It’s never crowded nor do I have to wait a really long time to be helped. I’ve already lost a couple retainers and when I go back to get another one I usually get one very quick. Everything is very clean & I honestly wouldn’t want to go anywhere else.< /review>< user_name>

Rose never fails to nicely greet and welcome us when we arrive and the dentists herself is the sweetest lady! Overall very professional and consistent with their scheduling of six month check-ups. 10/10 would recommend making this your primary dentist office!! They accept many types of insurances too.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Would not go here at all!
I called to get some general information and see if my insurance was excepted and the person that answered was speaking very fast and didn’t really know anything and just put me on hold without letting me know. Then came back to the phone and I asked for clarification on the question and she just put the phone down and next thing I know another fast talking woman picked up, very unhelpful and just cutting me off asking me to come in for a consultation when I’m just trying to first find out if my insurance will be excepted. The way they run this office already let me know how they run their  business and patient care ..UNPROFESSIONAL!!! If you guys want to get peoples money you might want hire more professional, calm, and courteous representatives that answer calls.< /text>

Great dentist, she is caring and knowledgeable. Showed me my x-ray and let me know my best options. Fillings are easy and not painful. Referral for wisdom tooth aching, cleaning was easy and gentle. Highly recommend. :)< /text>

<Text>I have always had a negative association with going to the dentist because of how painful it can be. However, during my visit I felt completely welcomed from the moment I walked in. I liked that the Doctor was patient with me and addressed the issues that I was having. During my cleaning and cavity fill I felt little to no pain and I liked that the doctor and her assistant would ask me how I was doing during the procedure. I thought that my previous dental office was pretty good, however this dental office has set a new standard for me. I can actually say for once in my life that I enjoyed my dentist visit.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

From the moment you walk in you are greeted with smiles . Which now a days isn’t so common in most offices however Northridge Dentalworks is one of the few remaining places that does. Staff, they’re all amazing including the doctor . They’re all sweet, attentive and very knowledgeable. They answer any questions that I may have from dental insurance questions  to my dental health care. Also dental work always makes me nervous but they make me feel like family, so I know I will be well taken care of.< /Text>

<Review>I visited Northridge Dentalworks yesterday for a consultation, dental exam, and x-rays.  I was experiencing pain and inflammation in my upper right molar as a result of a poorly done root canal performed by a former dentist about 14 months ago in Woodland Hills.  After having horrible experiences with the last two dentists that I’ve had the displeasure of being a patient of, I was losing faith in finding an honest and caring dentist who isn’t just focused on upselling unnecessary procedures or overcharging/taking advantage of patients. I WISH I HAD FOUND DR. TAVAKOL AND HER AMAZING STAFF SOONER!

I needed an appointment as soon as possible and was accommodated to be seen for a same day appointment with ease.  There was ample, convenient and free visitor parking available when I arrived. The front office staff was courteous, efficient, and professional. Rocio assisted me with any questions and concerns that I had with a genuinely caring, patient, and professional demeanor.  The waiting room and back offices were very clean and comfortable.

The wait time was reasonable and I was called to the back room for x-rays.  After x-rays were completed, I was promptly taken to another room to be examined by the doctor.  A dental assistant named Patty made sure that I was comfortable and offered me a neck pillow.  Upon being greeted by Dr. Tavakol and explaining the reason for my visit, I knew that I was in good hands as energy speaks louder than words.  She was very attentive, kind and personable. During my exam, Dr. Tavakol was gentle and throughly went over my x-rays with me in detail.  She didn’t become bothered, condescending or frustrated  when I had multiple questions as my last two dentists had.  Her bedside manner is excellent and she put me at ease!  Apparently, my former dentist performed a root canal on my upper right molar (tooth #1) which was completely unnecessary.  The tooth should have been extracted instead in Dr. Tavakol’s professional opinion.  This was very disheartening information to discover, but I am eternally grateful to Dr. Tavakol for her fair assessment and honesty.  It gave me hope that there are still honest dentists out there.  I also learned that I needed two other molars extracted and was given a referral to an oral surgeon and a goody bag.

If you’re looking for an HONEST and professional dentist who will not upsell unnecessary procedures and genuinely cares about the overall long-term oral health of her patients, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dr. Tavakol and her wonderful staff!  I cannot thank you enough Dr. Tavakol, Patty, and Rocio and will be recommending all of my friends and family to your office for their dental care needs with confidence that they’ll be in very good hands!<//Review><rate>5<//rate>< Gmap_id>

We call  this Splinters park, because the structure is made of wood that was build in the 80's or early 90's.  It is so weathered the wood is very course and you can get splinters in an instant( see the photos I posted of my daughter there a year ago) It has happened mulitple times.  And the slides are metal
(photo of that too), so the sun  them (Splinters and Blisters park)< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Small quiet park. You can relax in the shade. Several amusing sculptures have been erected, next to which is a museum with a dozen paintings.

(Original)
Маленький тихий парк. Можно отдохнуть в тени. Установлено несколько забавных скульптур, рядом музей в котором выставлено с десяток картин.</review>

Husband and I love this restaurant. We've tried most of their plates and they are delicious (burrito, soft tacos, tacos dorados, gorditas, menudo and so on). Today we had the famous "costillitas con nopales en salsa de chipotle" (pork ribs with cactus in chipotle sause). Suuuper goooood!! And the best service. You should also try my favorite agua fresca, "agua de alfalfa con limón", it is very refreshing.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYZAfUT4R3sBELm4uDO4xR8aREyDvBII6Jsp_O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

< Review>
For some reason the overall quality and quantity of the meals I've purchased was excellent for over a year now but,
As of the past couple of months it's gotten less and less of a desirability.
With 0 sour cream as to it's previously being included as well as their chicken quesadillas had literally 1-2 pieces on each 1/4 sliced with stail over cooked, crunchy flour tortillas with an overall undisirabiliry eatable experience upon my most recent experience-dining/lunch-meal</Review>

< Review>
This place has been one of my favorites since it opened up. I love the chicken tacos, my favorite though is a double bacon cheeseburger combo for $8.50 can't be that! On top of the price it's fantastic and fresh food!:)
Highly recommended!<//Review>

The food here is excellent. Always fresh and clean tasting. The area around the restaurant isn't great, but it's worth the trek over. Get the chicken taquitos or nachos! Yumm<//text>

<text>The food is always very good and warm. The only reason I give this place a 4 and not a 5 is because it is always so hot in there. In a cold night it's no problemo. But I went in there a week ago and I remember that day being 80-90°F and I could nearly breathe.l inside the dam place. It was no concern to me because I ordered to go, but I truly fear for the staff health! Install A Dam AC!!!!!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is an informal place of Mexican food, with simple dishes but with good flavor, cheap and I also really like the handmade tortillas from this place and my favorite dish is the birria de chivo that is served on Saturdays and Sundays.

Prices are not competitive with other brick and mortar retailers and nowhere near online pricing but if you have to have it now this is the place to go.

The store is huge and has tons of selection. Staff is very helpful.< /review>

There is NOTHING left but overpriced items !!! These so called sales are fake too. The liquidators came in and put stickers over the barcodes /upc and UP the prices. The employees know this too (Ventura too but this one is the worse). A toy that normally sold for $14.99 is now $29.99 with only a mere 20% off, still making it MORE than the normal retail price. Toys R Us to the very end you are STILL ripping off your customers, while leaving a bitter taste of goodbye in memory.  KB TOYS needs to hurry up and come back !!!< /Text>

<review>Very few employees in the store, they are ringing up everyone at the customer service line. The manager was unwilling to accommodate me on the buy 1 get 2 free deal for the Animal crossing amiibo cards. There were only two left. I had been there before the last time this sale happened and the cards hadn't rung up properly and he begrudgingly fixed it for me when I explained that the sale is supposed to include the cards. So here I was, this time the sale was taking the cards properly but sadly there were only 2 card packs left, I was getting some figurines too so I requested the ability to apply a 3 pack amiibo figurine set as the "buy one" so the last two card packs would be mine. he refused... fair enough... the sale did only specify "All Animal crossing amiibo" 7.99 and under... the 3 pack set was 24.99, again, not trying to get that discounted... I simply wanted him to make an exception because there were not enough card packs to apply themselves to the sale. So I asked if he could let me get the card packs as a buy one get one instead, since there was no second one. (this would not change the sale price at all if there had been three card packs) otherwise, since there were only two I would have to pay full price for both... he refused to budge even for this so I walked out with only the three individual figurines. This manager lost out on my 37 dollar potential purchase and I ended up only paying the 7.99 for the three figures. I won't be going back to this particular location anymore. plenty of other stores out there who will price match me. Shame on this location's manager :(< /review>< date>

I was looking for a jumbo teddy bear for my grandson's first birthday. Called the store and they were super helpful over the phone, describing all the bears that they had.

Went in the next day and found exactly what I'd hoped for, as well as a nice selection of FAO Schwarz toys. Again, the sales people were very helpful.

The bear and I then had an organic lunch at Sharkeys just down from Toys "R" Us.

The store is located in the Janss mall, very close to the 101 and Moorpark Road. It looks like a regular shopping center on the outside but the inner section has a cute little play yard for kids, as well as a number of coin-operated rides and a fountain area to play in.< /text>

Decent store, if you're not looking for speedy and efficient customer service (Or at least on the phone). Tens of times they pick up and just hang up right away because they don't want to do the work.< /Review>

Having bought and sold several homes over the years, I've come to just "expect" delays in the mortgage process. Not with Andre!

Andre exceeded our expectations in all ways. He helped us do as much paperwork ahead of time to allow for an extremely fast and efficient close of escrow. He patiently talked us through all of the loan options and made sure we felt comfortable with the loan we ultimately chose. He was available whenever we needed him, and gave us updates along the way. I never once felt concerned that we would close on time, even with a very aggressive timeline.

In short, Andre did a fantastic job and you should feel very confident choosing him for your mortgage needs!</text>

André is simply the best! He helped us a lot during the process. There were a lot up little things making the process difficult to conclude but this and his team made it all super easy for us. I know he worked super hard and with the best ethics to help us purchase our first home. We are extremely thankful to have worked with him and will always appreciate all the gestures and help that he provided. He was constantly communicating with me during the process and always open and available to answer my calls no matter what. You can’t go wrong with him, his team, and his services. He’s one of the best!</review>

We previously refinanced with Andre in 2019, and he made that process extremely easy, so my wife and I had full confidence in moving forward with Andre on a new home purchase. Escrow closed on our home purchase on 2/25/2021. Once again the process was flawless as he is on top of every aspect of the loan. There were no surprises, and Andre was available to answer all questions as needed. Whether you are refinancing or buying, I highly recommend Andre!<//text>

I did my VA refinance with Anchor Funding and the loan office - Andre Enriquez made my experience seamless. During the refinance process, he was always giving me updates and was able to get the lowest rate. I will definitely give him five star rating (on a scale of 1-5). Thank you Andre, you rock👍<//Text>

He is an expert with VA loans, and was able to help me close in just 21 days.

Any questions I had he answered honestly, and as a first time buyer, he was patient with me throughout the process. He was available via phone, text message, and email. He made this transaction seem more personal than working with a big name company and not having someone dedicated to just you. I highly recommend Andre and will definitely be working with him again for future homes.</Text>< gmap_id>

We highly recommend Andre. We just got done doing our second VA Streamline refinance. Andre has lived up to all his promises over the years. He first helped us get the help we needed to fix our credit scores 5-6 years ago and told us he would let us know when we were ready to not only buy a house but be able to sustain it. Well Andre kept his word and we were able to purchase our dream home in 2017. The interest rates where high at the time but it was a risk worth taking. Andre ensured me to look past the interest rates and he would get me the best interest rates as soon as they became available.  Once again I trusted Andre and he delivered. We did our first VA streamline and he got us down significantly. Flash forward to today and we just got done doing our second VA streamline and Andre took us down to a 2.5%. We are extremely thankful and appreciative of all your help Andre. Andre always answers his phone and is very helpful every step of the way. It’s good to have someone on your side with your better interest in mind.<//Text>

<Text>We moved from the Sacramento area. Andre was so easy to work with. He was honest and fair with us from beginning to end. We eventually made three offers. One house that fell from escrow due to the sellers backing out. We went through so many ups and downs. This made a lot of work for Andre, but he ended up reassuring us that everything would eventually work out. He was available, patient, and explained everything. Andre's personal and knowledgeable expertise of the region played a critical role in getting us our dream home!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

I Bought my first Home! so excited and content, all Thanks to Andre Enriques. When I first reached out to Andre he first made me feel comfortable and asked what he can help me with, I told him my wife and I are looking into buying a home soon and would like to know more on how the process works. Andre was more than happy to explain everything to us from the start to end. I served the U.S Military for 10 years, as a combat veteran I wanted to use my VA home loan and with Andre he just explained everything, very knowledgeable in his line of work, he is good at knowing what may cause an issue that will delay the loan and walk you through the whole way so there won’t be any issues. I must say since I started looking for homes it only took my wife and I less than 6 months until we got our house keys in hand, good thing because we are expecting a child in October. I highly! Recommend Andre to anyone who is looking to buy a home or if it’s your first time like me and want someone you can trust Andre! For the VETERANS out there that have their VA home loan benefit from the military and want someone you can trust Andre!. Thank you for helping us buying a home, we will meet again when I refinance my house.

<text>At the last minute and after I put an offer in I decided to try a different lender with the hopes of a better and lower interest rate. I was so concerned but knew better was possibly out there, then I was introduced to Andre. He responded quickly and did what I thought was impossible. Not only did he provide incredibly fast and professional service, he got me the lowest interest rate possible. A freaking 2.875% on my VA Loan. No matter what time of the day I contacted Andre he was available and happy to help. Please do not doubt this man! He has been a blessing to me and my family and he can be a blessing to you and yours. What are you waiting for? Give him a call. You will not be disappointed.

Buying a property is an exciting and important decision. It was also an unknown process for me, however with the guidance and expert advices of Andre Enriquez I was able to purchase my first home.
Andre offered me a great costumer service by always being able to answer all my questions. He also give me several loan options that accommodate to my budget. Dealing with Andre means dealing with someone that cares for you and that he will guide you until the last step of the loan process.
Thank you Mr. Andre for helping me and making this process easy<//review>

<Review>Thank you Andre and your team for getting our tricky refi done. Being a former business owner and a current independent contractor, we had some extra hoops to work through. We are glad it went through and we have a new 15 year loan at a great rate and shaved off 4 years off of our current loan.<//Review>< Pics>

Andre and team are seriously the BEST! We were qualified for a loan within 24 hours, he picked up the phone every time we had a question or concern, and hooked us up with an amazing realtor, Jose Valencia, who went above and beyond to make sure that we were 150% satisfied with our purchase. Such a pleasure to have had them on our team and if you are looking for someone who has integrity, honesty, and genuinely cares about your financial well-being, this is the place to be!< /text>

Finding an excellent mortgage lender company  is a rarity & almost impossible nowadays! Look no further. Andre and his team are amazingly helpful!  Highly recommended. Andre helped me go thru the entire process flawlessly!  And he never stops helping me to this day with all of my questions even after close of escrow. So glad I went thru him!< /review>

We highly recommend Andre. He is very professional, friendly and most of all honest, which is so important in a mortgage broker and not always easy to find. He made the process very easy buy keeping us informed in every step. He was always available to answer all our questions.<//Review>

Andre recently helped us navigate the home-buying process and was amazing! He was in touch with us to check in and to update us on what was happening. He was friendly and approachable and always able to clear up questions, the 1,000 questions we had. We had such a great experience working with Andre.
We had recently purchased our first  home and it was not as stress free as buying our second home and I am certain it was because of Andre and his team. The entire experience was smooth, fast and left us incredibly satisfied.. Highly recommend Andre and his team for active duty military or prior military seeking to use a VA Loan. We’ve been dealing with another Lender for 3 months when they dropped the ball and almost caused us our contract not to mention our money. So with our closing being delayed, I contacted Andre just for advice. Within minutes he called me and arranged for us to meet. He gave us more information than we had received the ENTIRE time we were with the other lender. He educated us. He was so resourceful and informational. His experiences gained him the respect and workmanship with all the key players involved in our process. This made our journey smooth saling from there.
He outlined a plan of action, which I loved because we didn’t have time to waste, contacted our Realtor and explain the new game plan and we are NOW homeowners because of it. He is a beast.</text>

We are so happy to have worked Andre! Our buying situation was a little unorthodox but he saw no challenges, only solutions. From day one answering my 100s of questions simple or not (I always have questions)! He was always in contact with me letting me know what was to come so that I was always prepared. He was super helpful in every aspect of the mortgage process. No question about it. Andre is your man!<//text>

<Text>Working with Andre and First Priority Home Loans was the best call of the year for us! He made our loan process stress free and streamline. Isn’t that what we all want when working through a home loan? Andre’s response time was very quick, he never left us waiting with updates or questions. He built a solid working relationship with our realtor who was also impressed by him. To top it all off we were able to close over a week early! Do yourself a favor and call Andre for your home loan or refinance, you will be happy you did.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>We've worked with Andre before when we purchased our house and he was the first person that came to mind when we thought about refinancing. I know it wasn't easy because of the health crisis we are facing now and the additional safety measures that were set in place for everyone but Andre was with us every step of the way until our loan was funded, answering our every question and letting us know what to expect. The whole process was seamless and it's all thanks to his professionalism ang great customer service. Thank you Andre for making this a stress-free experience during these stressful times.< /review>< username>

Andre is as good as it gets! He's the definition of transparency! There were no surprises, no hidden agenda, everything was exactly as he explained! He was available any time to answer any questions we had and provided a great amount of information regarding the process and choices available to us. We've worked with other lenders in the past but this experience was totally different. There was no pressure, no sales pitch, he does business with integrity and genuinely cares for his clients. I would highly recommend working with Andre!</Text>

Andre did our refi and did an awesome job, kept us current on what needed to be done and where we were at in the process.  Took longer than expected due to Covid as of no fault to him. A smooth transaction all the way around.  I would highly recommend Andre for your refi or mortgage needs.<//Review>

I am very happy and satisfied with the level of professionalism Andre handled my paperwork and how he not only informed me of everything that needed to be done, but was also kind enough to find the best options for me. He is awesome at his job, and he was always available to answer my questions or concerns never leaving aside his great attitude and patience. All throughout my loan paperwork he was clear, specific and detailed with the information. Highly Recommended!< /Review>

Andre certainly delivered with a no fuss, easy to understand re-financing process. He laid out the choices and gave you the plus and minuses of each choice. You need to be organized on your end with the required paperwork, but if you have all of it, the process goes very quick and easy. Any questions I had were answered quickly (faster than 24 hours turn around) and any concerns were address (people always get anxious around the closing time).  I would use him again for sure.<//Text>

Andre provided me with the guidance that I needed to put myself into position for home ownership. Andre and his team walked me through the entire loan process step by step with ease. All of my questions were answered immediately. When it came to securing the loan, they did all the work. As a first time home buyer I expected the process to be long, drawn out and grueling. It was quite the opposite. It was quick and painless. We closed escrow earlier than I expected!!!  I have recommended Andre and his team to my friends and will continue to do so. Andre and his team are absolutely worth 5 stars!!< /text>

< Review>
July 2019:
Amazing experience working with Andre! He 100% helped make the home buying experience for a first-time buyer a simple and easy process. Easily accessible through phone or text during any time of day; something essential for me as I’m a full time night shift employee, a full time student, and a business owner. I don’t typically trust people easily, but had no problem trusting Andre and his team to guide me and remain on my side of the team during the entire mortgage process. When I’m ready to buy my second home, I will be returning to work with Andre without a doubt. Five stars well deserved. Highly Recommend!

May 2021:
Jose and Andre! These two guys are some of the best in their business. I just finished closing on my 2nd property in San Diego and these guys helped make the process an extremely pleasant and easy experience from the beginning. Jose patiently set up times for me to go see at least 6 properties and put offers left and right during this crazy market. Andre also patiently and willingly sent me accurate numbers and figures representing all of the potential properties I was seeing. They are both very knowledgeable in their field and can answer any questions you have every step of the way. I value their suggestions and input regarding my interests when finding the right home for me. These guys are the real estate dream team! 5 stars, highly recommend, will definitely be my point of contact for any future real estate needs!<//Review>

<Text>Awesome, amazing and extremely helpful is the best way to describe Mr. Andre Enriques!   I could not ask for more!

First time home buyer, and Andre was great!  Low fees coupled with a great rate and amazing customer service.  With me being a first time home buyer, I had many questions, and was always timely responded to, and no question was too stupid.  I appreciated the professionalism coupled with support and warmth I received from Andre.  By the time it was all over, I felt like I gained a new family member.

From A-Z everything was seamless.  I'm so grateful for this opportunity to work with him and he will be my go to guy as long as he is around. I highly recommend.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<GmapID>0x80d94515b50c44f7:0x912e09d3bfecc401< /GmapID><Text>I don’t write many reviews, reserving them for exceptionally good, or bad, encounters. However, my recent experience with Andre Enriques while obtaining a mortgage definitely warrants an excellent one.

The search for a lender started with combing through Yelp reviews, looking for mortgage bankers with excellent reviews and experience with VA loans. After narrowing the field to five lenders, I compared their advertised rates on the internet. This resulted in two candidates.

These firms were asked to provide quotes in a loan estimate format.  Neither were happy about giving me this information before I committed to obtaining my loan from them, but did provide it. Andre gave it to me after reassurance that his numbers would not be revealed to another lender. It took three requests from his competition to produce what I asked for, and when I compared their numbers, it became evident why.

The seller had given $10,000 to cover my closing costs. Both lenders would have left me with no out-of-pocket outlays for the loan, but Andre’s numbers left approximately $6,000 that could be used to buy down the interest rate. The competition had eaten up the excess with inflated fees and extra charges.

Andre’s service throughout the process was amazing. The man must eat and sleep with his phone on and a laptop next to him. I don’t recall even one time he didn’t answer the phone, or call me back within a few minutes. Emails were answered almost immediately, no matter what time I sent them. He guided me through every step of the process, from providing a list of documents that I would need to submit, to informing me the loan had funded.

If I ever need another home loan, it will be brokered by Andre Enriques.</Text>< Rating>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Andre Enriques is an extremely competent mortgage broker with integrity that you just don't find everyday. I am a self employed lawyer and my wonderful wife works with me. So our only choice was a "bank statement loan" - what's that? Exactly! It takes a true pro to find one and at an excellent rate and reasonable origination fee. If you are self-employed, Andre is the man. He kept me informed every step of the way and I can be a real pain. Save me a lot of money we need to get out first kid through college. Andre is a family man, and Dianna IS his better half, but he holds his own! He has been a fixture in EastLake for years and is not going anywhere, so call him with confidence, you will be glad you did!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1544061546232, 'text': 'Thanks Dan!

Andre and his team were awesome to work with. From the time we met we felt at ease knowing Andre had our best interest in mind. I am a retired Veteran and don't easily trust just anyone; I would say I'm a pretty good judge of character. I was right about Andre and am 100% happy with the rate and service I received. If you need a VA expert, Andre is your man!< /Review>

We were excited to start house hunting but never imagined we would look at so many houses. I won’t lie it got stressful at times but I am glad that was the only stress we had. We decided to use our VA loan and went to Andre Enriques to begin our quest. We hear many things about purchasing a home that you should be aware of but once we met Andre we knew we were in good hands. Since the beginning Andre was on top of everything. Any question we would have he not only answered but made sure we understood. He has nothing but patience and really makes you feel comfortable. Once he got us pre approved he told us what we qualified for and then asked us what our budget was. Even though we looked at so many houses he not once pressured us into looking for houses that were above our budget. He was part of our team. He wanted us to find the home that would make us happy and  kept us in budget. No matter what we called for and when we called he was always available. If he didn’t answer he would call back right away. Andre was truly with us very step of the way and even now after having purchased our home he still reaches out to make sure we don’t have questions or need anything. Andre thank you and your team for all your help, We are glad we made the decision of going to you. Definitely going with you again in the future if the opportunity presents itself.< /Review>

Andre was great to work with. He was knowledgeable and worked with us to make sure we saved the most money. He looked after our best interest and made sure we didn't get ripped off. Unlike the other company we were looking at, he understood where we were coming from and told us exactly why certain options weren't good for us.</Text>

<Review>For my home loans Andre Enriques.  In 2007 and also 2012 Andre helped me and provided the best loan available at the current market. Andre's professionalism and integrity was reflected in every single decision taken as to what loan was best for me. He found the best loan for me with the best interest. There was never pressure into being put into a loan that didn't fit my financial needs. Andre goes above and beyond. He is not only a loan expert but he is personal and you're just not another client but he makes you feel like family and he is probably giving you the  same loan that he would be getting if purchasing a home. I highly recommend Andre for your future mortgage loan(s).<//Review>< resp>

Andre is a true professional in every sense of the word. My husband and I were very lucky to find him when we purchased our first home, 8 years ago. And once again, he has gone above and beyond for us with the recent purchase of our new home. Andre truly cares about his clients, and we are more than happy to recommend him to anyone in the process of purchasing a home or refinancing. Thank you very much Andre, you are the best!!< /Review>

Dear Andre, it has been a pleasure to work with you, Mario and I are so grateful and we recognize you for your service and your integrity. You are always willing to go the extra mile, looking for the best option for your clients. As an expert, you always knew at all times, how to guide us to be approved to get the loan that we needed so much to buy our first home. No other person could have been our Loan Officer, but you. Count on our referrals!<//Text>

Andre is the man, no really, he is!
He’s super down to earth, knows his stuff, extremely knowledge, knows exactly what the underwriters will need and ask for. He makes sure your files are done accordingly and appropriately to have you search for your dream home immediately. It was a pleasure to have my loan handled by Andre the #1 mortgage loan officer. I’ve talked to a few officers before Andre and they quickly wanted to jump in and collect information to get me approved etc.
Andre took his time to explain features, benefits, savings and how his process works and asked for any additional questions before proceeding.
As a banker that’s what I loved, someone who listened to my needs rather than just hearing me out. From this moment on, Andre will be handling all of my loans and I’ll make sure all of my friends use his services as well.
Thanks Andre for all of your help from beginning to end, a purchase is “supposedly” the most stressing part of anyone’s life, for me it was as simple as 123 and that was thanks to you, I signed my final loan docs while on vacation, 3500miles away from home, who made that possible? Andre.
Gracias Carnal! 🤙🏾🤙🏾< /text>

Our Experience with Andres goes back six years ago when he first helped us to buy a house. When the time came to refinance my house, I didn't hesitate to go back with Andres because he's always available, professional and knowledgeable which are assets that are hard to find in a mortgage banker nowadays. He was authentically interested in helping us and has a strong work ethic. I highly recommend Enriques.< /review>

<text>Totally recommend Andre Enriques! We've tried for years to refinance but we would always get a "no" as an answer. He did everything possible for us to get our Mortgage refinance loan. He never gave up until we got approved. I also want to mention that he was always available for any  questions we had. Any doubts we had, he was always there to explain, step by step. Very trustworthy! He went above and beyond!! Thank you so so much Andre!!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>If there were an option for 100 stars, that's what I would rate Andre and his team. Andre is very thorough and knowledgeable in his field and I would recommend him to anyone in the market to buy a home.  As a Veteran, I was considering going with my credit union but my co-worker referred Andre and spoke very highly of him so, I decided to meet with him. After the initial appointment, I felt comfortable enough to proceed with him and closed on my purchase. He really is a VA Expert! Overall I am very pleased, Andre is the man!<//review><userid>111563043523410745310< /userid><response>{'time': 1537820770587, 'text': 'Thanks Adrian!!! I appreciate the business.

<text>From the first time my husband and I met Andre we had know idea of the process of applying for a loan to purchase a house since we bought ours 38 years ago,  After meeting with Andre on numerous times and many phone calls he assured us that the process would be painless and he was right. He made the transition from Boston to San Diego effortless with all the worries and concerns that we had.  We would like to thank Andre and his team for a job well done!  Anyone that is thinking of purchasing a house and needs a loan we would highly recommend him.  Again thanks for everything.  Mark and Beverly Burack< /text></record>

Definitely my "go to" loan officer.  Andre keeps you well informed throughout the entire loan process and doesn't make any promises he can't deliver on.  I value that a lot especially in the mortgage industry.  He works outside regular business hours to be available and make things happen.  I wouldn't trust my loan to anyone else.  I've dealt with many loan officers that are not responsive and just keep you in the dark to the point where you don't even know if the loan will go through or not.  If you want to deal with someone who's professional, honest, upfront, and available to answer any questions or concerns even on weekends,  then Andre Enriques is your guy.</text>

I highway recommed him along with his whole team, made me feel like part of the family.  He made me feel like my account was his most important account by answering any questions during the day, night and even weekends and all within minutes of asking. I am definitely going to him for our next financial need. Thanks Andre!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Andre is by far the best mortgage lender I've had the privilege to work with. From day one he was very helpful, informative, knowledgeable, and most importantly honest. He completed my loan in less than 30 days and got me a great rate. I will be referring Andre to everyone I know. Thanks Andre!</Review>

My husband and I are extremely satisfied with the service Andre provided us. He was very detailed and guided us thru the entire refinance process. We had a very bad experience in the past and were a bit skeptical about everything but Andre explained everything in detail and made us feel very comfortable throughout the whole process. Andre was always available to answer our questions, even after business hours. We will be coming back to Andre when we are ready for our next mortgage loan.<//Review>

We are first time home buyers with ok to good credit.  We came into his office knowing nothing about buying a home.  Andre educated us and helped us purchase our first home.  He was highly recommended by my cousin and her husband. He worked well with my realtor who also spoke very highly of him.  I have and will also recommend Andre for your home lending needs.</review>

Simply the best!! I highly recommend Andre Enriques and his team to anyone in the market for a refinance. Andre helped my family and I refinance our home to payoff high interest credit cards and to pull cash out for my daughters college tuition. The process was seamless and stress free. Thanks Andre!<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Andre Enriques has proven himself one more time. Today we closed a real estate transaction in 15 days as he promised. His hard work, knowleage and dedication to his craft amazes me. When ever I recomend my clients to Andre, they feel comfortable and in good hands. If you or someone you know wants to purchase a home, Andre and his team will deliver from beginning to end. Glad to call him a trustworthy lender and friend.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Andre absolutely crushed it for us!  Everything Andre did was top notch, from the pre-approval process to the finishing touches on my loan. We even closed ahead of schedule and under our estimates!  Great rates and even better customer service.</review>

<Text>My experience with Andre has been nothing but perfect.  When I bought my first house he was more than helpful explaining things to me and always informing me of what was going on. Having not been through this process before, it was all new to me and he made it very understanding. I would receive phone calls and emails letting me know how far along my mortgage was. On top of being very good at what he does, he is very honest and will get you the best deal out there. I have now gone through the refinance process with him after a few years and again just the best experience when he is helping. I totally recommend using his services if you are looking to buy a house or refinance. I will definitely be going back to him for future home loans and consider him the best mortgage banker in the industry.< /Text><user_id>115699382708984265530<//user_id><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5< /rating>< resp>

<text>Andre was a very kind man who took great pride in helping us make our loan process smooth. He was always very helpful and always answered any questions we had.
He was very patient with us getting him all the info he needed to fund the loan.
I would recommend Andre to my family and friends as he is very honest and loyal.

Have to say it was a pleasure working with Andre as our Mortgage Banker. Since day one he was always ready and more than happy to assist with my one too many questions. Only had to come to the office once or twice for signatures and to hear the breakdown of how our loan was going to work, but for the most part our communication was through phone calls and emails. Really convenient with someone who has three kiddos and not enough time in the day for meeting up. After our meeting, I still had plenty of questions but Andre was always available and answered every phone call and question I had. I can honestly say not only did we get a new home, but we also gained a new friend who is not only knowledgeable in his field but also trustworthy. I would recommend him to everyone that is looking to have a satisfying and easy loan transaction.</text>

<Text>I cannot express how much I am glad I worked with Andre Enriquez to finance my home. The man is incredible humble and awesome to work with.  I must admit that I tried to work with someone else to refinance my home before I decided to work with Andre, and boy was I right to go with him.  He is super affordable, and is always willing to be there for his costumers.
I can honestly say that he is the best to trust with any home loan (he also did my home loan) and refinance.  My advice to anyone: true Andre; he is the best!

Thank you Andre! I look forward in doing business with you again in the near future.

Located in the downtown plaza, this is the locals theatre. Wish it had 3D, but other than there is always enough variety of different movies to choose from and they are very community oriented. Have been to red carpet openings, local church services and fundraisers here. So they are more than just a movie theatre and part of Oceanside< /Text>

Old review but this coming from a street kid from outside the theater. Back then, the movie never stopped outside which was awesome but now it's calmer and more peaceful (read: kinda dull but still awesome)

However, the establishment itself is amazing!! Most theaters are amazing and this one is no exception< /review>

Great theatre, munchies and close to the beach. So after the show you can take a nice romantic stroll on the beach. Or as a family 👪. It's a great place to let the tide come in and take your worries as it goes out. Even if it's just for one evening, it helps us relax. As we see the ocean washing away those feelings, we realize that it could be worse. Go and I hope you have a great night 🌙.< /Text>

Pretty uncrowded, surprisingly few people there and after a certain time which I’m guessing is 10pm they close ticket sales out front and you have to go in and buy from concessions. Seats were comfortable and the theater had decent sound so not much else to review. Staff were friendly</text>

The theatre itself is great. I love that there are a variety of Good choices for lunch or dinner before your show. I only deduct 1 star because the weekend nightlife can get a little rowdy in the area and you typically have to park a couple blocks away.</Text>

The theater and seating are good and pricing is also. They need to make one improvement. Sometimes you need to go inside to the concession stand to buy your tickets.  When that happens, they need to have a separate line for the people who are only buying tickets to the shows. To have to worry about missing the start to a movie because you are waiting for people to get their popcorn, etc., is a big mistake!< /Review>

<text>The Regal Theater in Oceanside is the one that I just mentioned while I was talking about Knockout Pizza. The sheets are very very comfortable the price is not bad guys if you taking your girl out for a date on Friday or Saturday night and you're going to take to the movie theater take her to Regal in Oceanside. Right there in the same area is a place called Knockout Pizza go enjoy some of their Pizza then go to the movie theater and after the theater right next door as you walk out to the right side is Cold Stone ice cream take her for ice cream afterwards you going to score lot of points. People if you looking for a place to go during the daytime on the weekends and during summer or the kids are out of school Regal Theaters pretty good place but that whole area has real neat places to shop and different restaurants to go to. Knockout Pizza is real good for the whole family but you've got several other restaurants up and down that walkway out there you've also got a Tea Cafe a coffee cafe and several other places out there that whole area is real enjoyable just to have fun during the day.< /text>< Pictures>

First off this isn’t the grandest nicest theater you will ever be too, but it’s small and old, which to me has its own draw.  It’s in the center of town and has an old time theater life to it!  I love it because it tends to bring the whole town together and it does it’s job showing great new movies, which since this theater isn’t too busy you can normally see new movies all the time with minimal crowds!  Hope this stays forever!< /text>

< Review>
Ok so I am a long time regal customer & Emma R. from this location is giving me grief about staying on a certain side of the theater while I was scanning posters for the app and looking at the selection of quarter machine options. I asked for her name so that I could make reference to her his situation to cooperate, as I made clarification of what I can and can’t do, while she was very rude interruptive and then wouldn’t share her name when I stated I would contact upper management about this “rule”. IT was actually so outrageous of how rude she was being I started video recording it where she began to walk away as I was asking her to please stop and talk about the policy and who I could talk to about this “rule” she went into a door and slammed it ! I’ve never been treated this way!
I will update this as I seek to file a complaint.<//Review>

I used my pass to buy a ticket to knives out. And half way through the movie. An attendant asked me;Just me if I had a ticket. That people and the manager wanted to know if I had a ticket. (Of course I did) but I did not like being singled out. This has never happened before and i will never ever return to this regal location. As a matter of fact the attendant did his walk and then came back to where I was. If I could give a lower score I would.<//Review>

<Review>We were there today for a showing of Avengers End Game. We were there early and had 10 minutes to spare so we hopped in the concessions line. This dude, ROSS, took almost 30 minutes to serve 3 families and took him 10 minutes to serve us!. I have never seen anyone move so slow in my life. The snails in my garden are faster! We we're 10 minutes early, but ended up almost 30 minutes late to our movie!< /Review><gmapID>0x80dc6e3745b141b7:0xcfb9516acd1a11b3</gmapID><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<Text>Being that this theater is located very near to many restaurants you’d think there would be some kind of leniency with bringing in your take out boxes from a restaurant that is located 10 feet away next door. I fully understand no food allowed in the auditoriums. Could lockers of some sort or a checker be available so that movie goers who have just come from dinner to watch a movie don’t have to throw out their leftovers? Waste of money and a waste of food. Being that the public parking garage is a few blocks away, if you’re showing up to your movie with about 5 minutes to spare then you run the risk of either wasting the money you spent on food, or wasting the money you spent on movie tickets.
Very annoying that there isn’t something in place so that guests can bring and store their belongings or takeout, instead of tossing in the garbage.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

When we got there the picture was not on or sound. Went to ask why it hadn't started, because it was 5 minutes late. When the movie came on, it was not the beginning and there was no sound. We asked for our money back and they did. Very unprofessional<//text>

I went to Regal 16 in Oceanside today to watch the re-release of Avengers: Endgame with my boys. After 3 hours of waiting for the bonus footage, it was not there. We watched the same movie over again. The manager offered our money back or to come back at a later show. Regal customer service initially lied to me and said the only addition was the new spiderman trailer but, in the end I corrected them on that. They gave me 4 tickets but, I don't feel like they have an appreciation for the time and effort of mine that was wasted by them.</text>

This theater was clean from outside all the way to inside the theater. Staff was great and helpful. One thing that online said is that there is valet parking but the box office said there is not. Signs on mission lead to parking lots that either aren't there or a couple of very long blocks away. There's a parking garage but the box office said next door but there isn't one next door. Not sure what people with disabilities do that need to be a little closer. Don't go on Thursday's due to a farmers market going on along street across from theater. Street parking is 2 hours or less so that eliminates movie goers. The theater is great otherwise though. We would love to go back but the parking is an issue. We parked in a lot that was $5 but then that makes it more to see a movie.< /review>

Early movie, Deadpool!! Not crowded at all. Like I said it was early😁 parking could be an issue but they do have a valet service. Pretzels were tasty. Prices are what they are. I suggest an early movie if you are looking for a lower priced showing</review>

<text>Well, you saw me again soon.  You still have that dreadful reserved seat setup -- this in a house of theaters that never sell out.  Only a dozen or so patrons in an auditorium that seats hundreds -- and you send someone around to check to see that everyone is in their assigned seats!  What a waste!  Please listen to your patrons and do away with this terribly bad idea of a policy!  There's no need for it!

Problems experienced this visit: All drinking fountains are still out of order -- after months of being so.  Work lights were left on in the theater even after the show started -- I had to go out and complain to have them turned off.  Do the boys who clean the theater after the show check to see that the work lights have been turned off?  Apparently not.

It's always sad to see a good thing die.  I have many pleasant memories of the glory days of the Regal Oceanside, but those days appear to be over and the theater appears to be dying.  Please bring it back to life, and start by doing away with those confounded reserved seats!<//text>< Resp>

The movie was great but waiting for it to start was 25 horrible, abusive minutes of loud, offensive commercials mixed with an occasional preview of a coming attraction.  I won’t be back to this theater, even though it’s less than 10 minutes from my home.<//Review>

We went here hoping for a great experience. The movie was good! But we complained 2 times during a movie about people talking and being rude. The management did nothing to fix the problem. What a bummer! Not so happy about that. They were having fun putting their hands up on the projector, shining lights, talking so loud, and being so rude when we asked them to be silent. Not one time Did management address this. :(<//Review>

<review>Staff is nice and friendly. This is the type of theater where you don't have to chose your seats before and its first come first serve. A good thing is that the showings are never really packed so its not too hard to find a spot. However the seats count be updated.</review>< Pictures>

Our most recent visit was during opening weekend of the biggest movie in history, by box office earnings, but it was obvious that the theater was understaffed and/or poorly managed.

The concessions stand routinely has very long wait times for basic popcorn and drink orders. It was especially bad during this big weekend, when one would expect extra staff and a streamlined process for filling orders.

There were several problem patrons in the theater who made it impossible to enjoy the film, and when I went to find a manager, he just wanted to know if someone was drunk--as if that were the threshold of a disturbance worthy of acting on a complaint. We considered leaving and demanding a refund, but simply telling one of the obnoxious groups that management was coming made them leave first.

I was vaguely aware about an hour later that he had eventually made his way into our theater to look around.

The bathroom reeked of urine and was strewn with trash.

Two stars because we think the seats are pretty comfortable with enough room that the person next to me texting through the entire movie was something that I was eventually able to block out of my consciousness.</Review>

Not horrible. Not great. But it works and I have had a good experience both times I've gone. It's dirty and old but the screens are good and the sound is decent. Staff is nice. They do check purses but I assume they are checking to make sure you're not bringing in food.<//Review>

I prefer going to this theater for the main reason that you can go to see a movie with out having to buy tickets in advance. You also get to choose ypur own seats. Tuesdays are their discount days so you can get tickets for 6 or 7 bucks and $2 hot dogs and $3 nachos. They also have a small arcade with a good variety of games.< /Review>

<text>The staff is kind and polite but the theater seats smell like mildew and feel nasty old....this locations is badly overdue for a serious remodel! I do not like this location! For Oceanside this is unacceptable in my opinion! Building tons of view restricting apartment complexes but not upgrading the theater by the beach?! Really?< /text>< Pictures>

Where to begin?  Usually dirty, no parking, and the movies never start on time, it usually takes someone finding an unenthusiastic employee to try and start the movie.  It's nice that it is located in downtown Oceanside, but if you can go somewhere else, i would.</Review>

< review>
Takes too long just for popcorn, and last time I was there all of the registers stopped working for debit cards. Even tho I just paid with my card to get my tix.  Asked to speak to a manager he said he couldnt help me with out having cash,I asked if he could ring up my snake order at the ticket window and directed me and my 3yo outside to an atm. No discounts were offered, even when I asked.i spent 20mins in line,before he sent me out side, at 1:15 and my movie started at 1:20 plus everyone un line was upset ay me and my kid thinking we just cut them. Most  them didnt even know the machines were down. I work in customer service, I would have expected more from a manager espically if the customer is trying to drag along a feisty 3yr old kid that is absolutely not going to stand still in line again. I had $8 cash and the snacks were $14 and some change. Just disappointing.</review>

The movie experience was partly ruined by the terrible experience with the staff. Some kid names Ross at the concession stand took 25 minutes to serve 3 different orders, I worked at a movie theater as a teen and I dont remember anyone being this futile and slow while keeping their job. He couldn't take a complete order without walking away from the stand. My family almost missed the beginning of our movie while waiting on food. Theatre room 6 was a bit sticky but its expected for such a big movie season so that's not a major issue.<//text>

My wife and I saw a good film there. I wish since the 2 theaters in San Jacinto and Hemet are owned by the same people couldn't there be a wider selection of films available. Both pretty much show the same pictures. A wider selection would be appreciated.</Text>

Tried to order a beer at concession. Understandably the cashier couldn't ring me out because he was too young. He contacted the manager and flat out was ignored, heard it from the manager "umm, kind of have alot going on right now".
There were multiple employees over the age of 21 that could have assisted.
The manager looked pretty not busy to me, the customer, who was willing to pay almost $10 for a beer.
I'm not sure how the staff is trained here, but it is obviously not with a customer centered approach.
Terrible service, still no beer.
Time was 6:30 pm on Sunday July 28.</Text>

Better theater to watch new releases along with family. Special section for families that give more privacy and comfort. Picture quality and sound effects are superb and that catches the customers again and again. Best choice for those who are planning to enjoy your leisure time with friends.</text>

<Review>Overall it's pretty good. Surprisingly for being in the middle of in town Oceanside it's never usually that packed. Parking is a little further than I would care for but for something in the middle of town I guess it's not bad.

Decent experience at Regal.  Film selection is outstanding, but the theatre itself is a little run down.  Seating is ready for remodel.  Restrooms were strewn with paper towels but facilities were otherwise clean.  Of course, the refreshment prices are outrageous . . . but where aren't they?< /Review>

<text>Went here three times to watch Big Hero 6, Rogue One, and Bumblebee. While watching Big Hero 6 and Rogue One, I find the volume of the theaters okay. But when I watched Bumblebee, I found out that the audio volume was a bit higher than usual, maybe because I was more used to AMC and Cinemark theaters, (I also have autism, and sensitive to loud sounds sometimes) but I was bearable for me. DMed Regal's customer service on Twitter and they replied that they forwarded my comments to the manager and correct things for future visits. Was going to give this place 4 stars because of the loud volume, but instead gave it 5 because Regal's customer care is better than ever!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I've been here plenty of time and the service was just decent never great, but tonight I was denied access to see a rated R movie when I definitely look of age, I had left my ID at home because I was out with friends and joined them in their car.  So I had asked for a manger because I thought maybe the girl was new because I've seen plenty of rated R movies there before and not asked for ID and when I had talked to the manager (Danielle) she was beyond rude, she wasn't listening to me when I explained the situation, rolling her eyes and kept telling me to have a nice day (it was 8:00pm btw) So I was upset as I was leaving I had said "man this sucks"  and the manager Danielle turned to me and said "that makes me want to help you less" and what I said had nothing to do with her it was about my poor situation I was in, so I turned to her and said "wow that was unexpected" and she responded with "now I don't want to help you leave now" so I asked for her name and left and will not be coming back, and will be making sure to let the company know to hire more professional people.< /review>< pics>

There times on google aren't correct. So when we got our tickets for what we thought was the standard 1:30 showing of beauty and the beast it was already started. We went to correct the problem and they weren't helpful. Telling us Fandango was their official times. So they made us purchase the additional $7 for the 1:30 showing in 3D. the 3D it was horrible and something was wrong. I went to talk to the same manager and she blamed in on the film. She refunded us for the 3D and we ended up having to get tickets for the 3:50 standard showing. It was a very frustrating experience.< /Text>

The theater needs updated. The seats are old and has an old smell to them. The staff was nice when I told them the first look wasn't showing anything, only sound. Unfortunately the answer I got was someone checked and it seemed fine. This theater is in desperate need of a face-lift. Worst Regal I have been to.<//review>

Have been comin mg to this theatre since I was a kid. Great place to bring a date or even a nice family outing. Sign up for the regal card it could win you free tickets and popcorn. Great surrounding restaurants and attractions. Would be 5 stars if they upgraded some seats.</review>

<review>My local theater. Its in the heart of downtown so expect lots of kids and boots from base. If you block all of that out the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. I have become a regular where they often ask how my husband and I are doing and discuss our thoughts on the latest films. If you want a quiter affair definitely hit up earlier showings, where the crowd is a bit older.<//review>< userid>

Did not like this place at all. They made us wait outside in the cold, they also argued with me about going to the bathroom. I was 35 weeks pregnant...<//Review>

<text>Staffing is incredibly polite, courteous, and attentive to you as the customer.  The physical facility could use a remodel to clean up the toilets and the actual theaters.

After viewing several movies each theater's seating is dramatically different.  The seats are either good or uncomfortably bad.  Moving to a different row does not help and we would feel guilty utilizing plush vacant seats next to the handicap designations.

The restrooms are tagged and carved throughout from the local juveniles.  If you can look beyond the markings the bathroom is acceptable.

There is a heavyset manager ( female ) who is similar to ursula the sea witch. Didn’t even have the common human decency to let an elderly disabled gentleman charge his electric wheelchair as it was running low and he was not able to make it home. He came into my store and our outlets don’t open, so my coworker suggested he go there because he said they have open outlets and this rude heifer comes out and isn’t even polite, just rude and nasty toward him and i. Plus i understand it’s not their obligation but really? 5 mins of using this establishment’s electricity is really going to rack up the bills? Its really going to bother you THAT much?  Hopefully he got home safely.<//text>

The worst service experience. Waited 40 minutes for popcorn and soda. The lines were long and the wait longer. I was with my 2 boys watching the Avengers End Game and we missed at least 30 minutes of the movie. The employees were rude and management only opened up another line 30 minutes later.  $50 for a bad movie experience due to poor management.  Regal Cinema Oceanside get your act together! 😡 Upset and feel ripped off!< /review>

Reliable in a sense that you can see a variety of movies here and it's not limited to just 5 or 6. Time availability is also good as you can always schedule around lunch or dinner times. A few downsides though: first the seats are a little uncomfortable. I u understand they're not the reclining ones but they can be uncomfy if the movie is longer than 2 hours. The price is not the best and there is another smaller theater in Oceanside that charges less for their "budget day." Discount for students also isn't great as it's just a buck less than regular admission.</text>

Horrible projection / picture. I came to see Contagion, and the picture was horribly blurry, and the 3D lens was left on for this 2D movie. This means that the movie will look 80% darker than it should. The way you can tell this is that there are two beams of light coming out of the projection booth rather than one. I tried twice to ask politely if they could focus the picture, and nothing was done. I finally asked for my money back, and the projectionist and manager came out and told me that this was how the movie was supposed to look. That was a lie. I am a film student and I have been to see hundreds of movies and this is not right. This theater, along with the whole Regal / Edwards chain rips off customers with poorly projected movies. It's $11 for something that will look FAR better watched at home. This is why movie theaters are dying, they simply do not care about the films anymore.<//text>

First time going to this theater. We must have drove around a dozen times looking for parking. We were finally able to valet park. However, the valet told us we needed to be back by 9:30. We almost did we the move due to not knowing if we were going to get our car back.

The theater was not as busy for a Friday as I thought it would be. Which was a good thing.  Concessions are pricey as expected.< /Text>

<text>I didn't really like this theatre much. It has that dirty, dingy look and feel to it. The aisles are so small my husband had to sit sideways. I'm short but the lady in front of me had her chair back a little and my onolee kept hitting the back of her seat. I also feel like the picture quality wasn't as good as other theatre's I've been to. Also the floors are sticky so be careful. It was kind of gross< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dc6e3745b141b7:0xcfb9516acd1a11b3< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

<text>Checking women's purses? For guns?  If you are doing this because you think someone is going to bring a gun in, I won't fight for a parking space anymore and will just watch movies from home.  First, women are not the ones bringing guns to theaters and shooting people- very rare for a woman to do this.  Second, a guy is not going to bring his gun into the theater in a purse.  He will have it tucked down his pants or in a jacket or something.  I've always come downtown when I wanted to see a movie,(even though other theaters are closer and parking easier) because I love supporting downtown Oceanside.  But if theater owners think there is a big enough chance of some guy bringing a gun in to check women's purses, I will stay home until they have a more thorough way of checking for guns.<//text></record>

<review>Pros:
-The place is clean and very accesible by walking from the Oceanside pier.
Cons:
- The seats are not comfortable.
-The quality of the movies is not good. The regular 2D movies looked does not have enough contrast to sufficiently watch dark/night time scenes.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Time>

Went for a special showing. In beginning, we hear the sound but no picture. In theater 1, 3rd row from top, in center, seats smelled like pee... Nowadays, we are so used to comfortable seats (especially reclining), these old chairs were uncomfortable after 1 hour... For $15 show starting 5:30pm, I'd like to expect more.😩<//Review>

Situated about a block away from the Oceanside Peir, Regal Oceanside Stadium 16 usually has a large number of people around it at any given time. Although there is almost always a large number of people at the theatre and in the immediate surroundings, it never feels overcrowded there. The price of movie admission and concessions inside the theatre are comparable to that of any other theatre in the county. I give hogjt ratings to this theatre and I would certainly recommend visiting if you come to Oceanside's beach, pier, or harbor areas.</text>< Pics>

<Review>It was on a warm day this August 2017, and humid.  It felt like they did not have adequate air conditioning during the movie.
Additionally, I had just purchased an iced coffee on the way to the theatre, and I was unable to bring it in to the movie with me.
I was very thirsty, so I had to spend $7.00 on a bottle of water.  I don't drink soda.
I normally spend $3.00 - $4.00 for 36 bottles of water at Costco.  So $7.00 for one bottle of wster is outrageous!
The theatre in Carlsbad allows you to bring drinks in, and has reclining seats with adequate air conditioning.  This theatre did not unfortunately.< /Review><rate>3<//rate></record>

Dated and in need of a retrofit. We saw Rogue One in 3D and there was something wrong with the brightness, the whole film was too dark. Good luck actually finding the theater if this is your first time there.<//review>

Got home and changed my clothes - seat of my pants and back of my shirt smelled like Lysol.  Even the back of my underwear smelled like Lysol.  I'm doing my laundry as I write this.

We completely love going to this movie theater and it deserves more stars than this but last night the man checking the tickets at the door at around 7:00 pm was so unbelievably rude to my wife it made us feel extremely uncomfortable. She was smiley and told him sorry we're taking so long to pull up the tickets on our phones and he literally looked right at her, gave her a look, and didn't acknowledge anything she had said. Then he proceeded to talk to the people behind her. Then after that he told us we had to wait in line so we had to do this again which was fine but after how my wife was treated the fact that he was serving everyone else with mutual respect and smiling but not her was pretty obvious and we even asked another couple about it. Second round may have been worse and made it feel personal. He had no problem being friendly to the other people buying their tickets or being told to wait in the line. Anyway, they let us in and he gives us both a clear cut sign of disrespect when I'm trying to show him the tickets and we basically could have gotten in free this man wanted us out of his sight so bad he goes, "theater nine" and I asked if he wanted to see my other tickets considering I had only showed him 1 and I bought 3. He looks at me with an annoyed expression and just goes "Theater nine!" ok... and my wife was just like why is he being so rude to us. That was truly no way to be treated especially when we did nothing as civil individuals and it felt so targeted just for us because of how everyone else was treated by this 1 man.</Text>

<Review>Went to go see the Purge- a rated R movie and were constantly asked for ID. You only have to be 17 to watch a rated R movie. I'm 21 and my girlfriend 20 were asked multiple times for ID. It was excessive. We weren't buying alcohol and we don't look like 13 years old. It's a movie! The employees were just rude and it was just frustrating to be asked multiple times for ID. Also Regal needs to make it possible for members to give their phone number to be given their rewards points. Since that's why you get the membership in the first place is for the reward points but they claim they are unable to give you your points without the card presently with you. Just an overall bad experience at the movies. Will never go back to this theater in Oceanside.</Review>< pics>

This place was terrible- their lobster dinner was horrendous, and the prime rib absolutely sucked. the creme brûlée was terrible and gave me watery diarrhea for an entire week. And the waitresses were complete jerks. Overall the atmosphere was nice and the food was delicious! highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys fine dining, goats, salt water pools, and witchcraft.</review>

<Text>Meh... Was once the best theater in town, but it has fallen into disrepair, technical inferiority and behind on luxury, when compared to it's competition. Seat leather cracked, grafitti in the bathrooms and a grime that seems like sticky soda that has not been properly cleaned... Not quite the budget theater class, but on it's way without a remodel or maintenance..< /Text>< Pics>

The theater has a good facelift but that is about it. The theater is dirty and old. The seats need to be replace due to the stains and huge rips. It is really sad because the theater is in a nice location.</text>

<review>Would give 0 stars if i could. Went to see the last showing and after it was over my wife accidentally left her wallet in the theatre. We realized only after walking to the car. So we were back in about 3 minutes max but they already had closed. But no big deal because there were only a few of us in the movie and all of us left at the same time so we knew they couldnt have taken it. However we went back the next day before they opened and was the second one in the door and was allowed to look for the wallet. Therefore the only people in the theatre was the staff. However the wallet was not there. And despite the theatre obviously being cleaned up by the ushers, the manager told us they hadnt found a wallet. We also found one of the cards on the ground which indicated someone obviously opened the wallet but there wasnt one turned in by the staff. If the card was on the ground before they cleaned they would have cleaned it up right?< /review>< Response>

< review>
I have only been to this theater one time, but the seats were stained and torn. For a Regal Theater this is disgraceful and disgusting.

I have been in an AMC theater on the Marina in Long Beach for $5.00 all day on Tuesdays with leather recliners. The prices here do NOT fit the atmosphere or condition of this place.

<review>It's ok. It used to seem a lot better until some of the newer theaters started popping up. The seats don't lean back here, whereas at the new theater next to the Westfield mall, you can bring blankets, lean all the way back and kick your feet up on a foot rest and everything.</review>< Pictures>

It was okay, there was nothing all that wrong to be honest, just the seats need to be fixed, food quality, little things like that. Costumer service was excellent. 👍</Text>

In a good experience, even though it doesn't have a bit of the frills other theaters have in terms of reclining chairs or other things. It certainly is made up for by the person's working there. A good experience by the beach, and I will certainly visit again. Worth the hassle of finding parking.<//Review>

Watched The Last Jedi. There is way too much light leaking into the screen from the room. They use red lights to light the exits and stairs, but it's poorly designed, and the movie looks really washed out when there is a dark scene. Not only that, an employee came into the theater twice, to check a box at the front of the room, using, again, red light that washed the screen in red. Very annoying.</Text>

Stinky, ripped seats, small screens, seats don’t recline, felt gross sitting in the chair. Also what the hell kind of a theatre doesn’t have a parking lot...?! Probably will not be returning.</review>

Run down and it's a shame because it has such potential.  More than two seats in this stadium style theatre were broken which made it difficult to sit above them or next to them.  The screen was surprisingly small compared to other regal stadiums.  We were there to see Hunger Games< /review>

The staff is incredibly rude. It's dirty. The screens are tiny and grainy. Don't bother unless you're in it for the 6 dollar Tuesdays or if it's down the street.</Text>
