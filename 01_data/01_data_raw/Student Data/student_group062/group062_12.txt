Great selection of clothes at reasonable prices.  There are even designer labels. Nice shoe and purse selection as well.  Seems like they downsized the home decor and domestics selection. What they have a nice stuff.  Haven't really shopped the men's clothing department, but seem to be well stocked.  Only negative was at checkout where the cashier decided to lecture me on the divinity I was buying for my husband.  She informed me the first ingredient was sugar, to which I answered, yes that's what divinity is made from.  She then asked if I was trying to giveu husband diabetes.  Wow.< /review>

<rating>4< /rating><review>You get what you pay for at Stein Mart. We got over 10 articles of clothing from sweatpants to polos for $250, which is completely unbeatable. With that being said, some of the zippers have already broken and there’s not a ton of brand name stuff to chose from.

The checkout line moves faster than one could imagine, and the people seem incredibly nice.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Excellent products. Love this store! Only problem is with their check out line. They need a different system. Every time I'm there people try to go in line at cashiers while people wait in a long line across the aisleway.<//Text>

Stein Mart, I always shop for my husband's clothes because they carry the best of the best...My husband loved everything I bought him, they have quality. The service was fast getting through the line. I didn't feel any frustration at all.< /text>

<review>Found great interview clothes and then got a job and returned for additional work pants at a decent price. I like they have petite clothing so that my purchase was ready to wear without needing alterations. The only negative thing is that the staff that was working the dressing room area swooped up my top and I was left practically walking out the front door in a bra!!! After spending almost $300 on work clothes that day. You'd think they would have given me a $5 defective shirt at least to make up for it!!! But, no...they didn't and it's been almost 3 months and STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY SHIRT BACK. I ASKED WHEN I SHOPPED THERE LAST AND AGAIN THEY COULD NOT LOCATE IT🤔🤔🤔<//review></record></dataset><record>

My wife will never shop there again

The Company they use for Credit is a Rip off.

They say they never recieve payments.  My wife  has had to pay $30  to stop Payment.

Now they want her to send a second check,

They need better control<//Text>

Everytime​ I am visiting this area I come into this Steinmart. It's always clean, and I can find many items I'd love to wear at affordable prices. The only negative is that you really need to pay attention to the sign verbage on the racks. Often it's not a sales price on the whole section, but just in that one arm of the rack. Now I know better, and I read them carefully. I wish I had a Steinmart in the Modesto area!<//review>

<Review>So I first chose albritten based on their reputation.  I paid over 20k for my system. I'd say the management is ran very good and the install team was absolutely terrible. They damaged my sheetrock in 7 places and the bandaid they tried to fix it was absolutely sub standard. left trash in my attic and in my house. I regret my choice having chosen them. The quality of work was so bad that it makes me doubt parts of the system I can't see. I wouldn't recommend using them<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80945e80b1826101:0xcc2ea5d2ba182373</Gmap_id>< rate>

I didn't want a "Jack-of-All Trades" individual working on my plumbing.I needed a "Professional" to do the job! My water would not shut off on my shower upstairs. So I didn't need any leaks after the fact. John at Allbritten responded quick and early to do the job. Maybe on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for right? The price buys quality work, guarantee's and ease of mind! Will call again!< /review>

<review>Get ready for an up sale!!! Wife called for a basic maint. (system works fine) she got 4 invoices for estimates for every thing from run capps to a membership program!! They said we need 2 run capps, our machine has 1 that starts both the compresser and fan btw to all kinds of other stuff. I replaced the run capp last year myself is how I know it is a dual unit, also replaced the t-stat and a couple other things. I got the parts from the same supplier they use( a/c license ). If you ask why I did not do basic service myself, I also don't change my oil in my car either even tho I am ASE master certified. Now I wonder if they even did the work as said.<//review><user_name>Scott Sebastian< /user_name>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Many KUDOs for the service provided over the past week from Jonathan Garcia.  I had an ageing American Standard toilet that had been problematic the past few years.  I had an on-going intermittent "ghosting" for several years that was infrequent enough that I just ignored it.  More recently, I was getting drips that turned out to be from a loose bolt connecting the tank to the bowl, and a dampness on the floor around the toilet.  After Jonathan's first visit he quickly found the loose bolt and tightened it and replaced the gasket in the tank with one that I provided.  Unfortunately, (and I was warned) it might not work since it wasn't an American Standard gasket.  After a few hours my ghosting was much more severe but Jonathan had showed me what he did so I ordered and replaced the gasket myself.  In the meantime, I had panicked and call Allbritten to have Jonathan return for the next available appointment a few days later.  I was still getting water from someplace that needed to be diagnosed.  When he returned, Jonathan replaced the wax ring and inspected the toilet.  Unfortunately (I just can't catch a break), he found a crack in my bowl.  After some discussion, I ordered a Toto toilet which I hadn't heard of before.  The next day he returned and installed the new Toto.  I have to say that the new Toto is so much better than the American Standard I had.  It flushes more effectively (gets all the sh** in a single flush), more quietly.  And, is quite stylish.  Thank you Jonathan (and Dave for working with me on this).</Text>< pictures>

I had been using Allbritten for years.  My high expection for their high quality service and reasonable value came to an end.

The technician came for the maintenance service.  He found out that the defrost control board needed to be replaced.  He quoted us $352 (discount included!).  I questioned about the necessity of the service, but I agreed with the quote anyway.  He came back to complete the service, and he found another issue with the thermostat.  He quoted me $295 for the replacement.  I felt it would be an unreasonable price, but I agreed anyway.  I found out later that the non-programable thermostat only costs me $35.  How did the $295 service cost justify an add-on service that only costs them $35 for the material and  less than 30 minutes of labor???

I called the following day to talk to the office manager.  She confirmed the service cost of $295.  She gave me $30 refund.  My expense went down to $265.  Does it make me feel like a valued customer? Nope!  I felt like I was robbed.  According to homeadvisor.com, " For a standard, 2,000-square-foot home, the cost of installing or replacing a thermostat averages between $112 and $252, including the price of the unit and professional installation. The national average cost is $173."  Allbritten charged me at least 1.5  to 2 times higher than the national average.  With out the 15% memership discount or $51 discount they offered me, my cost could go up to $346 ($295 + $51)!!!

I still give Allbritten 5 stars for the service.  I only give them 1 star for the value.  Unlike the 5 stars they received from me in the past, they only get 3 stars overall under my evaluation.< /Text>

<Review>I was very impressed from the moment I called in to schedule a service call. The professionalism from Rebecca, Chelsea, to Pool the service technician made me feel very comfortable. They were able to come out the same day and also fix my heater the same day. I was very happy with the communication and how quick they were able to come out. Thank you everyone at Allbritten!<//Review><user_name>latemodelracer28<//user_name><gmap_id>0x80945e80b1826101:0xcc2ea5d2ba182373<//gmap_id></record>

Outstanding service for a reasonable price. (Not cheap, it is plumbing! But not unreasonable at all.) Aaron is very good to recommend what is necessary and prudent and explains everything. And that keeps me coming back.😊</Review>

Ok my cooler was throwing out fan heat they fixed it it came out to be $660 it’s an old unit it’s like 35 years old so I was OK with it and yes I did try to sell you more parts mention $65 fee for A diagnostic which we said OK we knew some parts needed to be replace and did mention AC plan $189 a year for service and they won’t charge you the $65 I didn’t need that for now but they do have good reviews and I’m pretty sure we might go and get a new AC eventually through them unless we hear of someone else that’s better.</review>

However did not explain why they ran didn't run ventilation pipes under the house until 6 years later, when I had other people check, when I asked about it they said that's just how it is with my house. Which I can understand, however not explaining this when the work was done I found to be unprofessional.< /Review><UserId.>116661615577016762922</UserId.></record>

CUSTOMERS BEWARE. They up mark their parts by 300% or more!!! We were told we needed several parts replaced on our AC unit.  Part Model Turbo 200 Allbritten Quoted $300 the part online is $56. Part number 2 Hard Start Kit Part CSRU2 Allbritten $228. Online  $51 This next part is the worst! 30 Amp Single Pole Contactor 24 Volt Coil. Allbritten $176 Online $9!!!! and last but not least Surge Protector ICM part number IM-517 $188. Online $57. I am a business owner myself I understand we are in business to make a profit but I don't price gouge my customers. This is absolutely outrageous! Do not let their nice customer service fool you into getting ripped off and over charged. When I found this out I called their customer service. the agent  answered the phone and when confronted with the mark up, then handed me off to a service manager. When I confronted the service manager and asked her is it customary to up mark parts 300%? All of a sudden she couldn't talk to me because I was the Tenant and not the owner, how convenient!  We are not talking about someones colonoscopy here, we are talking about AC parts. The home Owner and I are very good friends and as a tenant I respect our landlord and do not want her to be overcharged especially on parts. I could understand a 50% mark up even a 100% mark up but these mark ups from Allbritten are very shady. I would never recommend them to any friends or family! In response to the owners message: if you don't share billing info with tenant then someone at your company made a huge mistake by directly emailing me the estimate. Secondly, to assume I don't under a service business model is to insinuate I am ignorant. Hardly the case. As my good friend owns a pool company very similar business model. He understands the need to upmark parts , gas, employees time, etc. However,  not upmarked 200 to 300%. 80 to 100% is more than reasonable.  Lastly,  warranty.. you say the upmark also includes warranty yet 9/10 that warranty is never needed and also 9/10 if the part is dysfunctional the manufacturer generally replaces the part free of charge so no out of pocket for your company.  I hope this review educates more customers and makes them look a little more closely to billing. I would recommend itemizing your billing. So the customer knows exactly what is being charged in labor, parts and warranty as to dismiss any confusion instead of bundling everything into parts. 👌 Update: 11/24/20 recently did a pick up service for one of our business clients overheard the owner speaking to her employee about a company who was trying to charge them for filters they didn't ask for over $5000 it was a commercial building. Then she stated a manager was supposed to Call them back and never did when they called all employees left for the day. I asked the owner it wasn't albritten was it? With a puzzled look on her face she asked how did I know!! Lol these people are absolutely crooks. If I experienced and this company experienced it how many other unsuspecting clients are they ripping off.</review>

{'time': 1599090301421, 'text': "Marc,\nFirst of all, we are so happy to hear that you feel we have nice customer service. This is really important to us, and it's a GREAT thing when people notice! But, I'm not sure you understand how our type of business works. We aren't a parts house, simply reselling a part. We are a service company. We come to your home in our fully-stocked truck, diagnose the issue you are having with our well-trained technicians, replace that part, and then warranty that part AND our workmanship for a year. But, we also give up-front pricing with everything included, not an hourly price, so there are no surprises after work is done. We give the estimate, then the homeowner can accept or decline that pricing BEFORE work is done. If they want to just use our diagnosis at $65, then go purchase the parts and do the repair themselves, or find another company to do it, we totally understand and that's their choice. No harm, no foul. We are sorry, but our policy is that we only speak to homeowners about pricing, and only give estimates and  invoices to homeowners. No offense meant toward you, it's just policy. If the homeowner shared the estimate with you, so you saw the pricing, that's fine. But still, our policy is that we don't speak about pricing with tenants. We would NEVER intend to rip anyone off, price gouge or over-charge. Our technicians are paid hourly, rather than commissioned or on piece work for this exact reason. We hope this helps you understand a bit more where we are coming from.\n\n~Andrea\nallbritten.com\n292-4919"}<//resp>

< Review>
The service technician caused a component to burn out on the control board when he was working on it. The burnt part is clear to see, although the Tech. stated that he inspected it and found no sign of burn. This technician left without checking that the unit was actually working.
Upon having the unit worked on by another company, A simple thermostat wire broken inside it's housing was found. The wire was apparently twisted too tight inside the cap used to hold the wires together. The control board was found to have a part burnt out on the left edge of the board. This was not burnt out when another Allbritten technician worked on the heater I'm sure.  Now who do you think should be responsible for the replacement of the control board?
01052019 This thing has never been fixed because our landlord has refused to fix it ever since this incident. Every time we mention it they try to evict us. This is happening again, and this company needs to come back and replace the circuit board they destroyed.... It costs about $400.00 at your supplier. I checked...< /Review>

<review>Although, one of the representatives at the office made several mistakes, the technician did an amazing job: he was professional, courteous and displayed genuine concern for my issue.  He was great!  Further, their manager was helpful in resolving the errors by the office staff.  He went above and beyond to ensure that the mistake was rectified, as much as possible, so for that I must say, “I will continue to use their services and will be signing up for their maintenance program.”</review><Pics>None</Pics><username>Presentacion Sanchez</username><Gmap_id>0x80945e80b1826101:0xcc2ea5d2ba182373< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>After calling another Repair man and him not being able to diagnose the problem I called Allbritten.

They came on time diagnosed the issue and gave me a price on how much it would be to repair it. Jim was very informative and took pictures of all the issues and of the part that needed to be replaced.

Overall great experience with a great company. I will be calling them for any future needs.</review>< Rating>

We had Joshua help us yesterday and he was fantastic.  We are also business owners and customer service is paramount to what we do and from the initial phone call to your office to the quality of service and the helpfulness of the staff Allbritten was absolutely outstanding.  Joshua bent over backwards explaining the issues with our units and because of his service we decided to sign on to the annual service plan.  We have and will recommend to all needing air and heating service.  Thanks so much, Desiree.< /text>

< Review>
The technician was good, the prices are a bit high, but they do offer after hours, which is super handy. The reason that they are receiving 5 stars is due to an amazing after hours dispatcher named Regina. She was just an absolute SUPERSTAR and even called the next evening to check on how I was doing. I tried to contact her manager in the office the next day, but THAT phone call was never returned, which was a shame. If it wasnt for Regina, they would have received a 3 star rating, but for people like Regina, I wish I could give her alone 10 stars and a HUG!< /Review>

I always thought I was getting good service with previous companies and the. I tried Allbritten and they have blown everyone else out of the water. Joe was friendly and informative and inspected things in our heating and cooling system that no one had ever done. He was honest and gave us great insight into how to better care for our AC.

It turned out to be just a bad cartridge and they quoted me $300 for just replacing a bad cartridge that could've cost me $50 from HomeDepot. Stay away!!!</review>< pictures>

Back on July 19th I called, needing help. I should have noticed, they have a map on their website, but I was outside of their coverage zone. Despite the fact that I wasn't even a potential customer, she called me back, was polite, never once rushed to get rid of me, and apologized, even though it was my fault. I almost never see that level of politeness anymore, when there is no chance of anything to be gained.

I called and was able to get someone out the same day.  I had previously called another plumbing service and they could not come out for 2 days!  I was very pleased with the service.  Aaron was pleasant and professional.  He explained the problem and it was repaired quickly.  We are very satisfied and will not hesitate to call Allbritten again.<//Text>

The tech was very professional and he answered my questions so that it was clear what this maintenance visit was for.  It was very easy to schedule the visit around the time I was available.  Since I live in the foothills of Yosemite and other companies don't tell you they only come into this area 1 day a week and they expect you to be available for them to come out and fix a problem at their convenience.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Good customer service, really affordable (I called other places they were twice the price and trying to charge over time on top of that if they came after 3pm, there over time was 280$ per hour which was ridiculous) All Britten came after 5pm and charged their regular affordable rate. I will definitely stay as their customer! Nick did good at explaining everything he was going to do and was professional too. #fixedmycloggedsink</text>

<Review>Rick M. was wonderful! He even remembered coming to our house a year ago and what he worked on. Rick was professional and arrived during the hours that were provided. He also gave us insight to the new products that will be introduced to help become environmentally friendly and informed us on pricing and didn’t pressure us to change the unit but told us to think it over for future plans. This is our second time working with this company and they’ve been great. Ian was our first service repair man.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Had an emergency leak on a Friday night. After searching through multiple companies that would be able to come out on a weekend I tried out Allbritten, Rosetta is who helped me over the phone and she was very helpful and pleasant, she scheduled me an appointment for that day and within a few hours the technician Pool Yang arrived, he was very near and thorough and explained everything in detail. The office called me within a few hours and scheduled me an appointment with the plumber for Sunday which was great! Nick Kalina came out, advised me of repairs needed and fixed everything in a timely manner so that I could get my ac back up and running. I’m so grateful to them for their prompt service and they will definitely be my new HVAC and Plumbing favorites. I highly recommend this company to others. Very very pleased 😀<//review>

Excellent service!!!! I am very happy with the service they provided. My water heater went out and when PG&E came out they said I needed a plumber so I called Allbritten, they had someone come to check out the issue in a matter of hours! They couldn't fix the issue right away since the water heater required a part and it needed to be ordered, but as soon as they got the part they scheduled me in and problem fixed! I loved the customer service starting from the initial phone call to the very last of the process. I highly recommend their service.< /review>

<review>If you have a leak; STAY AWAY from All Britten. Please. I'm going to make this nightmare long story, into a short one- I reached out to them due to a leak in my home. They came in did a "walk through" said i was going to be charged $2,200 per day but no guarantee that it would be fixed that day.   Then later suggested i should just re-do my entire plumbing because chances were another broken pipe would occur that was $8,800 (mind you they were going to break through the foundation of my home because they were sure, water was coming from underground). They said i needed to act fast or situation would get worse. I was stressed as a homeowner & really though All Britten was here to help me! To make this quick after stressing and talking to my insurance agent, he recommend to stay away from All Britten and referred me to American Leak Detection. Thank GOD! American Leak Detection came out, PIN POINTED the leak, it was coming from inside my walls, not underground, walked my through all his test he did to find the leak and quoted me $450. Like i said, DO NOT call All Britten for a leak. Your Welcome.<//review>< user_name>

Juan showed up early in the appointment window and promptly helped us fix a small leak in our kitchen faucet. He also cleaned out the drain from the dishwasher in just a few minutes. He also went the extra mile to check on getting us a new faucet assembly under warranty, which was a nice surprise! He did a great job and even made sure he was wearing boot protectors any time he was in our home....very impressive. A great experience from beginning to end, thank you Juan and Allbritten!<//Text>

We called for a service tech to investigate a leak in a bath/shower. Great communication and tech arrived on time next day. Issue wound up being pretty simple fix. A little overpriced in my opinion but repair was done quickly and tech was very nice and informative.
I would use Allbritten again.<//review>

Allbritten/ABC heating and cooling is a very dependable, thorough and considerate business.  From notifying us the name of the technician who would be coming, to putting protective booties over his shoes, to the follow up...the whole process was very considerate.  Although there is some idea that they're expensive, I think everyone reliable charges more than we want.  I just appreciate their diligence...plus they came out the same day in the middle of a triple-digit heat spell!< /review>

Lance arrived right on time. He was polite and knowledgeable and took care of our summer checkup. At the end of the service, he reminded us that this was our last visit under our Guardian membership plan and asked if we wanted to renew for another year -- which we did. He also offered a surge protector specifically for our air conditioning unit because it did not have one installed for it yet. We agreed to that as well.</text>

We have used Allbritten for years, from a new A/C-heating unit, maintenance service and so on.  Yesterday our water heater gave out.  I immediately called Allbritten.  Vanessa scheduled Zach M to come out for a consultation.  He was friendly and professional.  He offered various packages for a new water heater/installation.  The unit was ordered and installed early this morning in a timely manner.  I am pleased, as always with the service from Allbritten.  I highly recommend them because they are friendly, dependable and efficient.<//Text>

I wanted to get my AC unit ready for the summer so I called Allbritten to handle that for me. After years of hearing their commercials I figured I'd give them a go. They sent a confirmation text to me letting me know when the technician was on the way and it included a picture of the tech. He showed up pretty quickly after the message, which was nice. He introduced himself and explained everything he was going to do and about how long it should take. And when he came across an issue in the unit, he showed me a picture of it and explained why it needed to be resolved. This was my first time using Allbritten and I would definitely use them again.<//review>

Always a pleasant and thorough service.  This is the first time Julian came to my house and he was professional and kept his workplace neat and tidy.  He informed me of chemicals used to clean the AC coils to keep my pups away until the ground soaked it up for safety!  Always appreciate the hard work Allbritten company and their employees do! A HUMONGOUS THANK YOU (and hug) from a loyal customer.< /review>

My husband and I are getting a new HVAC system. We got an estimate from Allbritten. We told them what we were looking for, exactly what we are looking for. They decided they would absolutely have to board up all our old ducts and cut new ones (rather than testing the old ones and only doing what was needed like we wanted because it’s a couple thousand dollars for all new ducts), decided to give us an estimate for a system not needed for our size house, rather than the proper one for $3000 less, and added (didn’t tell us, we found it on the list later) dampers, which a small single story house doesn’t need. So in short, they tried to sell us thousands of dollars of stuff we don’t need after we told them exactly what we do need. We decided to go with someone who was honest with us instead.</review>

< Review>
I wish I could do a negative star rating. Their guy came out and quoted us around $600 to clean/replace the motor and replace a part he said was bad. We sent him away because we got bad vibes from his proposals and I went to a buddy of mine that owns a  commercial A/C business. Long story short, nothing was wrong with our system besides it needed a quick motor clean. Took about 30 minutes to do it and plug/screw everything back in. The part he told us he needed to replace was a $14 part and they were going to charge us $159 to replace it. Ridiculous! I don't write reviews very often. I only write ones that people deserve (good and bad). People should be warned about this company. Look up YouTube videos. You might get better advice from one of them.< /Review>

I've had Allbritten out a few times for AC and plumbing. Juan came out to fix my leaky kitchen faucet and did a great job. He insisted on wearing boot covers inside the home and gave me a couple options for repair vs. replacement. I had Sal out for the AC maintenance and the AC Quality Care Assessment through PG&E and while he was there he found that I had a bad capacitor and changed that out for me. Then I had Jimi and Juan out to clear the sewer line which has had a lot of root issues. They have all done a great job!</Review>

Jonathan was fantastic! He was quick and so helpful with my problem! As a busy mom, I appreciate how quick they came and helped with my plumbing problem. I love how they call before they come so you know when to expect them. Jonathan was also able to give me a few tips on how to prevent the problem for the future which was great! Definitely will call and use again and again!</review>

This company is phenomenal.  The technician today, Mike S, was kind, friendly but most of all knowledgeable.  He answered questions I had regarding a condensation pan as well as explained all diagnostic tests he performed.  My unit was serviced and I was given a checklist for everything that was covered as well as suggestions to possibly improve my unit.  Mike was informative, pleasant and extremely professional .  Hands down  - the nicest and the most well put together service technicians I've ever encountered.</review>

<Review>I was scheduled for a routine maintenance check on my furnace. However during the service the check-up was not able to be completed due to the pilot valve not sending gas to the igniter. The Service rep is working on getting us a quote on replacing the pilot valve, heat exchanger (due to the condition of that component) and then a full quote on replacing the furnace unit. The unit is from 1980, so it has had a long life. We are thankful that Allbritten is willing to give us this information so that we can make a well informed decision moving forward.< /Review></record>

James did a great job in a short period of time.  He worked very efficiently in unclogging our sewer line.  Thanks to James and Allbritten for handling our call in the same day we called as our "regular" plumber was not available until almost a week away.  I will definitely call Allbritten again should the need arise.  Thanks again<//text>

Allbritten provided an annual checkup for our air conditioning unit.  Phillip did an excellent job.  He was very patient while explaining what we needed to do in an effort to get my aging system through another hot Clovis summer.  Thanks to the entire crew at Allbritten especially Phillip, we should be "cool" !< /Review>

<text>Called for a quick estimate to get work done on my ac unit and was told it would cost me $65.  Zero compromises on the estimate and no hourly rates were given.  It's pretty obvious that they are trying to lock you in on service through them since you've already paid for an estimate. The other company they operate under is ABC cooling & heating.<//text>< time>

{'time': 1557873592722, 'text': "We apologize but we don't compromise on our pricing. It's called an upfront, flat-rate price. The diagnostic fee of $65 is not to 'lock you in with us' but rather to help us partially cover some of our costs of labor, our truck costs to drive out to your home, our training to diagnose the problem, etc. You are never locked in with us. We are more than willing to diagnose the problem, tell you the cost of the repair up-front, and if you don't like the pricing of the repair, you're welcome to take our knowledge of what repair is needed and do business with someone else or repair it yourself! We don't do our pricing with an hourly rate, but rather as a flate-rate price for the repair, which is an advantage to you! You know the price ahead of time, no matter how long it takes us! You don't have to hold your breath, wondering if we are dragging the job out simply to charge more, and not every knowing the cost until AFTER we are done and you're STUCK with paying it. If we run into a snag, have to drive to the supply house, takes us longer than assumed, etc it's the same price to you! We hope this helps to explain. We hope you're able to get the repair done and have a comfortable and cool home again!\n\n~Andrea\nallbritten.com"}</resp>

Service and Technician were both excellent.  I rec'd a phone call 1 hour before the technician arrived and he was very friendly and insured my service was done to my complete satisfaction before leaving. I called one day then received service the next.  I highly recommend Allbritten, and yes, they do wear covers on their shoes so floors are never dirtied.<//review>

< Review>
These guys have just about the most professional service guys I've ever dealt with.  They seem to really like their jobs and know what they're doing.  After 23 years of ignoring my house, it needed a lot of work so I got to know quite a few of them.

James did an excellent job with the water heater and went out of his way to re-arrange some of the plumbing that's been in my way for years.

Manuel J helped us when the heater quit.  I really appreciate the fact that he looked at the system and determined that the A/C was just fine and would be compatible with the new furnace.  No hard sell to replace something that doesn't need replacing.  Caleb, Lino, and Pedro installed the new furnace and did a fine job.  They left the place cleaner than it was when they arrived.

This sort of stuff is expensive so it's really nice to have pleasant people to deal with.  I highly recommend Allbritten.< /Review>

Before considering an expensive solar system, I decided to get an energy audit from a PG&E approved audit form.  Randy Chambers did an excellent and very thorough audit, and Richard Tamayo and Sal were very professional and a pleasure to work with as they sealed numerous air leaks in my attic, added insulation, replaced intake duct work, etc..  We'll replace my 37 year old sub-floor duct work in the cooler Fall, when having the AC off for a couple of days won't be a hardship.  If I eventually do go with solar, I'll need a much smaller system because of their work.</Text>

Zack from Allbritten did a wonderful job of diagnosing the concern I had with a kitchen faucet.  He contacted the manufacturer and learned the part was under warranty.  Part has been ordered and am just waiting for it to be delivered.

Zack was professional and explained what he was doing every step of the way.  I would not hesitate to recommend or have him back for future issues.<//Text>

<response>{'time': 1557873592722, 'text': "We apologize but we don't compromise on our pricing. It's called an upfront, flat-rate price. The diagnostic fee of $65 is not to 'lock you in with us' but rather to help us partially cover some of our costs of labor, our truck costs to drive out to your home, our training to diagnose the problem, etc. You are never locked in with us. We are more than willing to diagnose the problem, tell you the cost of the repair up-front, and if you don't like the pricing of the repair, you're welcome to take our knowledge of what repair is needed and do business with someone else or repair it yourself! We don't do our pricing with an hourly rate, but rather as a flate-rate price for the repair, which is an advantage to you! You know the price ahead of time, no matter how long it takes us! You don't have to hold your breath, wondering if we are dragging the job out simply to charge more, and not every knowing the cost until AFTER we are done and you're STUCK with paying it. If we run into a snag, have to drive to the supply house, takes us longer than assumed, etc it's the same price to you! We hope this helps to explain. We hope you're able to get the repair done and have a comfortable and cool home again!\n\n~Andrea\nallbritten.com"}< /response>< Pics>

Called for a quick estimate to get work done on my ac unit and was told it would cost me $65.  Zero compromises on the estimate and no hourly rates were given.  It's pretty obvious that they are trying to lock you in on service through them since you've already paid for an estimate. The other company they operate under is ABC cooling & heating.< /text>

Customer service is absolutely amazing from start to finish. I called into their office at 10:30 am to report my heater was not coming on, i was greeted by Mindy, who was friendly and understanding. She was able to get a service technician out the same day between 11-1 with a call to confirm when Mike S. was in his way. I got a call at 11 to say he'd be there in 15 minutes. Mike S. arrived with a business card in hand and had already read over the previous repairs before coming in. (Allbritten had been out a couple months prior to repair another situation we had with wiring.) Mike asked pertinent questions as he looked over our thermostat and then went into the basement to get started. He took photos on his phone to show me the problem and explained in in a matter I could understand. Mike then gave me the options to repair. I decided to go with his recommendation. He came inside, made some changes on my thermostat, because it wasn’t installed properly the first time, and then tested the AC and heater. Mike stated he tries to make sure customers are treated and taken care of the way he would want his wife taken care of. Nothing pushed or sold to her that wasn’t needed, to fix things in the cheapest, best way possible. I truly appreciated Mike S. as I am completely ignorant when it comes to these things. I trusted he was not going to take advantage of the situation and push things I didn’t need. He was very friendly and made me feel at ease. From Mindy to Mike S., It has been a pleasure to work with Allbritten!<//Review>

Richard was awesome!!! He thoroughly explained what was wrong with our unit, informed us of our options, and once we came up with a plan, got it taken care of quickly and efficiently, despite the heat!! He also answered some other questions that we had in general. Appreciate the quick service, and thank you for getting our unit back up and running!!</Text>

Nice folks, and I'm glad they were open on the weekend, but their quote for a new unit + labor was overpriced. Called someone else for another quote and he got the unit working after an hour! The fellow that came out from Allbritten sure didn't manage that. Still need to either replace a part or go for new, but we're not hot while we decide.<//Text>

It was easy to get an appointment, the technician was nice and he did a good job but they are VERY EXPENSIVE. It costed over $300. The same parts on Amazon were $30 and it was about 30 min of work. You pay $60 for the assessment and this is deducted from the repair cost if you decide to proceed. Next time I would probably try somebody else because of the high cost.<//Review>

Pool Yang came to replace our furnace humidifier pad as part of our semi-annual maintenance agreement with Allbritten. He arrived a few minutes early for the appointment window and replaced the pad in a very short time. He was very courteous upon arrival making sure he introduced himself and giving us his card. His work was very professional and done very cleanly. Over the years our experience with Allbritten/ABC Cooling has been very professional, courteous and satisfying and is the reason we have their semi-annual maintenance agreement for our HVAC PM.< /text>

< Review>
We had James out today for a clogged drain causing the kitchen sink and laundry to back up into each other and overflow.  What should have been a routine snaking turned out to be a bit more complicated to to some funky plumbing inside the wall.  James was very professional and prideful in his work and went above and beyond to make sure he handled our clog. He could have tried to sell us on a costly re-piping or plumbing modification but he took the extra time to get the issue resolved  with out any major plumbing work or major cost.  i would highly recommend James and will definitely being using him for any future needs.</Review>

I had Allbritten in the past for my heating and air conditioning needs and they have always been very reliable.  I am having their  yearly maintenance service again because they kept my unit in great shape in the past. Thank you Allbritten, Chad was great and I will look forward to seeing him again in the future!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>We've had numerous situations at our home where we've relied on Allbritten for their experience and expertise.  It all started back in 2013 when our old A/C unit bit the dust.  Since then we've purchased a new unit - sized to the proper needs - and added insulation to the attic to keep monthly energy costs to a minimum.  I must say that we are completely satisfied with the professionalism that we've been shown whenever a tech has visited our home.  We also purchased a new hot water heater last year and had a recirculating pump added to bring hot water to the kitchen sink and the back-of-the-house shower more effectively.  Hot water comes quicker now and there is less of a water waste.  The most recent visit by an Allbritten employee was by Isaac Flores last week.  He serviced the heating component of the A/C unit.  Very personable, professional and knowledgeable.  (As are all the Allbritten employees we have been in contact with.)

Thank you.  Richard Hardwick< /Review>< time>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Miguel and his crew were great. It was a very large job and we were told Wednesday- Friday but by the end of the second day Miguel came and asked if them finishing Saturday was an option. I stated it wasn't ideal since my husband gets up at 1am everyday and was really looking to sleep in on his one day off. Allbriten worked it out for us and sent 2 extra guys to finish the job. We have had solar added and a pool put in the last few years and Allbriten was by far the most customer friendly company. No one wants to replace their A/C, but giving my $ to such a great company made it suck less. Thanks for keeping your employees happy so they can pass it on to your customers!</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1557872530081, 'text': "Awesome! Thanks for the review.

Travis came out on our second call because somehow the the first duo that came out disabled our heating system. The initial call was for a winter servicing and our heating/cooling system was working fine but not after the first crew got done with it. The first crew left us in the lurch and I called the office back and they sent Travis out. Travis did a great job! He was personable and concerned about the situation. He said that he would get the system working and he did. After considerable troubleshooting, Travis determined that the white thermostat wire connected to the unit on the roof was broken inside the wire coating. Travis, cut the wiring back and reconnected the wiring and that was the fix to a problem that we didn't have before the first crew came out. I appreciate Travis's diligence and professionalism especially after the first crew created the problem and couldn't figure out what was going on. I believe the first crews assumption was that there was a problem with the thermostat when they had in fact broken the wire to the unit on the roof somehow. I will have Allbrittens's come back out in the future but It will be Travis and not anyone else.</text>

<Review>I have been using Allbritten since 2012.  Customer service is on point with this  company and their staff, not to mention their pride in their quality of work.  Miguel and Dennis proved that when they came out to put in my new ac unit and air ducts. My ac unit went out during the triple digit heat wave and they made sure my family and I were cool and comfortable during the installation.   Both were very polite, friendly and trustworthy.  I appreciated the fact that Miguel would explain to me what was being done and why during the course of the installment.   Definitely would recommend  to everyone.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>Allbritten is a company I will never do buisness with again. Rick M basically did nothing but try to sell me a new AC unit. He couldn't tell me what was wrong with my unit, he said it could be the compressor then he said my circuit boards where not working. After his "diagnosis" he said I needed a brand new unit. Any how I got Lee's Air to come out and they fixed my AC unit in 1 hour. Everything is well and running I didn't need a new AC unit. I will never do business with this company again. If anyone who needs their ac service call Lee's Air they are the real deal. Rick M and Allbritten will try to sell you a new unit.</Review><GmapID>0x80945e80b1826101:0xcc2ea5d2ba182373< /GmapID><resp>None< /resp></record>

I am very impressed with the company.  They called me right before the technician was on their way.  They were on time and courteous.   Daniel Fernandez was the technician who helped.  He was honest with the assessment and to the point.  He gave great recommendations and other services the company provides. He would answer any question I had, without having to think about it.  He knew his stuff.   I will contact this company again.  5 stars!!!!!< /Text>

<review>Chad is positive, knowledgeable, efficient, and kind to name a few qualities. I signed up for the heating and air conditioning inspection. Chad worked through an inspection list, informed me of the discontinuation of air coolent for my unit in 2020. He adjusted my gas flow which was too high and kept me apprised of all work completed. This inspection gives me piece of mind. My dad recommended Allbritten. I can see why. I am also pleased to have a service agent in case things come up. I service my cars and now I feel safer knowing my major home heating and coolent units are inspected on a regular basis. An added bonus is they do plumbing too!<//review><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

I wholeheartedly give Allbritten five stars for many reasons. The most important reason is the quality of the technician that came out (Ernesto M.) - a true professional. He was very personable as I stayed with him for the 2 to 3 hours he was here to service two air conditioners. He explained every test he did and showed me why something (like a capacitor) might be ready to expire. He was never pushy and left it up to me to decide what to do and whether to spend the money to do it.

I think Allbritten is a great service-based company that understands what the word service means. I also felt that their prices were honest and reasonable and I wouldn't hesitate to use them in the future. I don't think that there is another company in Fresno that can top them.<//review>

<Text>I'm giving 5 stars because of the time and care they put into taking care of our AC unit each time they come out. Our AC is buggy and yearly when it gets super hot or super cold it needs love and attention. Allbritten come out and provide that each and every time. The only sassy response I have is that I called at 6/7pm and they couldn't come out till the next afternoon. So, obviously, not a deal breaker at all, lol. They're great and we signed up for the protection/service deal they do. It's worth it's weight in gold. Keeps our finicky AC happy.</Text>< Name>

<Review>I had an AC issue in the dead heat of the summer. From start to finish, the professionalism, enthusiasm and prompt communications were outstanding. I turned to Allbritten in a frustrating moment with another air conditioning repair company and was surprised with the availability of a repair technician. The service tech Ian was on time and was prompt and thorough in his diagnostic tests. I had an interaction with John afterwards, which was informative and thorough as well, all with no pressure and transparency.

Over all, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of a repair or installation of an HVAC system.< /Review>< Pictures>

We just had a toilet replaced and a sewer line flushed out.  Ebert was great at recommending a make/model and did a nice clean installation of the unit.  Competent and fairly priced.  My go-to plumber.  Didn't try to sell me a higher-end unit than needed, like another plumber has done in the past. I highly recommend.  FYI, plumbers are not cheap...for a reason.  If YOU are, do it yourself.  If you have the knowledge, more power to you.  I don't, so I call a pro, except for replacing faucet washers, etc.< /review>

<text>Allbritten Plumbing has consistently met my expectations and provided excellent and courteous service. A year and a half ago Juan provided excellent and timely service installing a new hot water heater. Most recently, Ebert re-plumbed my main water supply, installed a new ball valve for the main and a new ball valve when he installed new sprinkler valves. He is a very friendly and courteous person, fully explained the job at hand, and demonstrated obvious pride in his workmanship.< /text>< name>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Our A/C went out and we called to get service.  We were happy that they said they could come out the next day.  To our surprise, a couple hours later they asked if it would be okay if they came out today and that there was a rep in our area and that he could be here in 20 minutes.  Happily we were only out of our A/C for a few hours.  Richard B was very helpful and seemed to really enjoy his job.  We thanked him for taking this late call (about 6 pm) and he said no problem at all.  He was asked if he wanted to take the call (because it was the end of the shift) and he said no problem.
Thank you Allbritten.  Great service.</Review>< Pics>

This started out to be a really good experience. I had an issue with my water spigot outside of my kitchen. It was leaking and needed repair. The price was a little high at $380.00 for replacing it, but since they were out here on a Saturday, I went with it. Let me say, this has absolutely nothing to do with the service technician (James Sabourin). He did an excellent job, was fast and courteous, and did a good job. However, he noticed the yard hose spigot (on the same repair) was leaking and suggested changing it. I asked him if he had the part, he did, so I said "sure, change it." This is an $8.00 hose spigot every person reading this is familiar with when they water their yard with a hose. He was still in the middle of completing the other repair so it was no additional service call. Literally took him two minutes to put on. When it came time to pay, I got a bill for $510.00. I was flabbergasted. I asked him, "you mean to tell me that an $8.00 spigot that took you two minutes to put was $130.00?" I could understand if I had them return on another call, or he was finished and ready to leave and had to come back with his tools, but he was literally finishing what he was doing and added the spigot. I can purchase and change this myself (and will) in a manner of minutes. You talk about terrible customer service. James almost had me ready to order the yearly air conditioning service as well. Not anymore. Instead of having a repeat customer for plumbing and a future customer for air conditioning, I will never use their service again. I will also let my family and friends know to avoid them. Unbelievably disappointing.< /review>

<Text>I’m so happy I found Allbritten!
We had great service with our AC  past July.
Unfortunately I had difficulty putting in a review for that technician. He opened our eyes and your doors to your company. We appreciate your workers.
So since we had great experience with your AC SERVICE we decided to call on you for our plumbing problems.
Aaron K came to our home today, introduced himself and made me feel comfortable to let a stranger into our home. He was very professional and down to earth.
He consulted me with all my multi plumbing issues.
He explained everything, his findings, options and plans.
He fixed my master bedroom shower immediately. It hasn’t been used for over a year because I didn’t know who to call or trust. I am so happy.
He fixed my tub shower and replaced the kitchen faucet. It’s all working perfectly now.
He is going to return and do more work for us.
Aaron is very informative, I learned a thing or two. He was respectful and considerate of my home.
To top that off...he cleaned up after he was done!!! Not a trace that there was plumbing work done!!!
I am so refreshingly pleased.
THANK YOU AARON!!!

<text>While reviewing several of the reviews on the internet I was somewhat apprehensive about using Allbritten, but when the air conditioner is not pumping out any cool air, you cannot wait.  I was disappointed that I could not get the $9.95 diagnostic that was advertise on many of the sport talk shows, but again no cool air.  Chad and Aaron came out to the house actually earlier that appointed time and did a terrific job, extremely courteous while explaining what they had found and what they were going do.

<text>I look at reviews for every thing.  I look at the bad ones and compare those first.  I  have to say when I called I was treated with respect and they were friendly, I  asked about the coupon and they said they would apply to service call and they did. I received an email with an explanation. Fortunately our central and cooling system was not not broken  but does need to be replaced soon it is a very old system. I appreciated the fact that they did not try to find something to fix so they could  charge me for. I would call them again</text>< Pics>

Always impressed with Allbritten's work.  The servicemen will always give their honest recommendation and then ask if that is how you would like them to proceed or if you had something else in mind.  I also find that they tirelessly listen to your questions and never make you feel foolish.  Work is professional and done with careful consideration to quality. I always recommend them to my friends and co-workers when the question arises and have never heard anything back but good experiences. Highly recommend.</text>

<text>I called Albritten on Friday and got a return call the same day. A technician appt. was set up for Sunday.A technician showed  up near the estimated time. His name is Daniel Benson. He had a pleasant manner about him as he asked about my situation. he listened with respect and told me would check out my A C unit and got right down to the.job at hand. In about 25 minutes he informed me the problem had been corrected and explained what he found. In a very short period of time i felt the coolness starting and was was thankful.

Rip off!! We had them quote us on replacing our unit and it is on average 3-4 times more than other companies. When we asked if that was the absolute lowest they could go, he said yup. We feel they just didn't want to do it. We were snubbed off by this company big time.</review>

He was right to say that we can't do the job for less- we have book pricing, and if companies can so easily just lower their pricing when someone asks, they were probably overpricing it in the first place. Why wouldn't someone give you their best price off the bat? It definitely wasn't a matter of us not wanting to do the job! We would love to help make every home comfortable that we possibly can!

< Review>
This was the second time Aaron has been dispatched to our home to fix different items, and I can attest to his punctuality, knowledge to get the job done right the first time, and he's always pleasant and has fixed items above and beyond what he was called for because he noticed that a problem could quickly develop.  Though the extra items were small and he did not charge us, they could have developed into something significant.  It's rare when you get that level of service and he's a major reason Allbritten will handle all of our plumbing and HVAC needs in the future.  Thanks Aaron!!!!</Review>

<review>So we had an AC unit that wouldn't get below 80 degrees. After a pleasant talk with Mindy P., when I called in, she was able to schedule a Technition the same day. Joe P. Came out and not only addressed the current issues with our unit, but pointed out what the previous Technition, from a different company, did that had me concerned. Joe was obviously very knowledgeable and was amazing! Even though we have to use our Home Warranty for the repair, Joe was happy provide his advice one what they should do. And if that wasn't already great service, Joe P. Also informed me on what I can do year round to help maintain a working system. Thanks Allbritten! And Joe!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Date>1531502578451< /Date><rate>5</rate><Text>Had one of the rooftop units stop working one evening after work on a house I just bought, Allbritten phone lines were open until 7pm, later than most companies.  Scheduled me a diagnosis appt next day, and on top of that they were early!  Met technician Daniel, and after troubleshooting he said that the blower motor was bad.  After my home warranty company could not get a contractor, we called Allbritten back and Daniel was out the very next day with the part I needed and was back up running about an hour after he got there and my house is cool again!  Can't say enough about Daniel and Mindy at Allbritten, and how friendly and accommodating they were, and that they got our house cool again for us our 16 month old daughter!  We will be calling them soon to service our units, and anytime we need A/C and plumbing needs in the future. Great experience.  Nice to feel like a company actually cares about the customer.

We would never want to make anyone feel disrespected, and always try to be as kind, patient and professional as possible! Unfortunately, we aren't sure what you mean about a contract and trying to get out of it. You were in no contract with us, and not a Guardian Maintenance Club member. We went out and added freon to your unit last year in August. Jackie thought the conversation was very cordial until she told you our availability to come repair your a/c wouldn't be for a few days but we could put you on our cancellation list, and it appeared you hung up on her. She did call back and leave a message apologizing that the phone must have gotten disconnected and asking if you were interested in scheduling an appointment for our next available date. We would love to find out how we can handle the situation better, but we just can't get to every home immediately when we are getting hundreds of calls per day with this heat. Thanks so much, and again our apologies. We are trying to get to homes with no cooling as soon as we can!\n\n~Andrea\nAllbritten Plbg, Htg and Air\n292-4919\nallbritten.com"}</Response>< Rate>

<text>Allbritten answering staff are very rude, and unprofessional. Especially  ( Jackie) I refuse to call back.after being disrespected,just because I called them out on the contract.and trying to get out of it..she doesn't own it so y great people like that. I will tell all my friends and family about my constant mistreatment. And terrible professional and terrible costumer experience. Please run the other way.

<review>Temperatures over 100 degrees for some time now and just recently moved into our house.  A/C unit went down, called ALBRITTEN and they had some one our in 12hrs. Previous company just added refrigerant, without testing, and now we are back to the beginning again.

ALBRITTEN inspected and tested our system to verify the A/C problems, Jerrod came out and offered some options..........Bottom line is: We are doing the work this week.  Technician, KEAL, was on time, professional and did the inspection and testing and let us know the results.

Highly recommend - On time, professional and friendly and they do not take short cuts.  Thanks Bill & Lynne</review><response>{'time': 1533161551720, 'text': 'Yay! So great to hear.

My a/c fan and motor went out and we needed service.  We have a home warranty, but when we called them the first contractor they assigned to us, Martinez Mechanical, never bothered to contact us for the appointment (they're supposed to contact us within 24 hrs).  I tried to contact them and kept getting the "the mailbox you've reached is full....so I texted them, and they responded "who is this"? I explained that my home warranty referred me to them and never a response.  The next place assigned to me, Indoor Quality Services, contacted me right away, but could not schedule someone to come out until the following Tuesday (this was Thursday, in California heat of 97+ temp, with no a/c).  I decided to call Allbritten instead.  Although I had to pay much more than I would have had I gotten to use my home warranty, it was worth not having to smolder in the California heat for another week.  The gentleman who came out, Justin Fiocchini, was polite, professional, knowledgeable, and got the job done quickly.  He also offered the home maintenance program which I opted for and it took 15% off my bill, plus they come out twice a year to do 23 point inspection, change the air filter every three months, get 15% off any repairs needed during the year (a/c and plumbing), and give my calls priority over non customer calls, even on weekends.  They are available 24/7, which is nice since something always seems to happen after hours.  Great job Allbritten!<//text>

We are very happy with the plumbing work done for us by Allbritten.  We had a problem with our sewer lateral.  The symptoms had been getting worse with time.  The Allbritten plumbers found and fixed the problem in a timely fashion.  They were very helpful in explaining the nature of the problem.  (It turns out that the problem originated with shoddy work thirty years ago during the original installation of the sewer lateral.)  In the future, we will call Allbritten to solve our plumbing problems.< /Text>

First of all: Albritten showed up on time, was professional and courteous, and repaired my AC unit. Thank you for that.
The down side:
This is the 3rd time i have used allbritten for AC repairs, twice on a rental home and this time on my residence. Our AC stopped cooling on Saturday and I called and chose to wait for them to come at their earliest appointment on Monday, preferring to use a company I have history with. On Monday, i had scheduled a $59 diagnostic appointment, and 2 servicemen showed up and in under 10minutes diagnosed my capacitor was dead. They stated they had the part on the truck and could replace it for about $275 plus the diagnostic fee. It was 107 yesterday and I had friends coming for dinner and in my own ignorance I said do it. Another 10-15 minutes later I have a working AC unit and a bill that I happily pay for a total of $333.00.
That night talking to several people who came over, 2 of them said they had had similar problems with their AC and the repair was significantly cheaper, so the next day I chose to call around to some of the local competitors, and received a average quote of around $150 for the repair including the parts.
I am at fault for not price checking and becoming to comfortable with a company. But I also will no longer be using Allbritten due to their hyper inflated pricing. I understand the $59 diagnostic fee, but to find out I was charged nearly double the going rate for a job that took 15min and replacing a part that costs $45 on amazon I feel taken advantage of. It's to bad, their servicepeople have all been very happy and professional, but at 2x the going rate for their work who wouldn't have a huge smile on their face all of the time?</Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1499879239496, 'text': "So wonderful to hear your experience with our technician, Chad went so well. Happy to hear he was courteous, able to properly diagnose the system SO quickly and had the part stocked on his truck, so he could do the repair and have the a/c running for your friends coming over that evening!  We spend so much time weekly training our techs to be able to accurately diagnose non-working units. Remember, we diagnose the system, then tell you exactly what's wrong, how we will fix it and give you a flat-rate price to repair before we start doing any repairs. We do not charge an hourly rate, but rather a flat rate. The fact that we were able to repair it quickly should be a positive, not a negative, or a frustration. At the time that we give you the price, please remember that you can always accept or decline BEFORE we start the repair. We hope you realize you can always choose to just pay the $59 to have us diagnose the problem, then do the repair yourself of call someone else, if you aren't happy with the price we give upfront. There is no arm-twisting and you aren't 'stuck' with us because we diagnose it. We do offer full warranty on all our work and a stocked truck with a trained technician, and we answer the phone anytime you need anything 24/7. We would love for you to give us another chance and are sorry you felt taken advantage of. This was NEVER our intention.\n\n~Andrea\nallbritten.com\n292-4919"}</Resp>< GmapID>

I called all the local AC contractors and was told they had a 4 week or longer wait list.  Because I had heard of Allbritton on PowerTalk Radio 97.6, I called them.  They were able to respond by the next afternoon and repair my AC Unit. Kudo’s for being able to respond to fast.
The technicians were very professional and experienced. The only negative I had was the price of the Restart capacitor.  I had checked out the Restart Cap myself Wednesday morning and determined it was bad and checked on Amazon for a replacement. The replacement was listed at $24 + shipping and tax so around $35.  Albritton charged me $236.00 for an upgraded Restart Cap that I could buy online at $85.  I could see charging up to 2x the cost, but this was a bit over the top. However, the two guys worked about 2.5 hours to repair the AC unit, put in a new fan motor, replaced the contacts and cleaned and service the unit and I wasn’t charged any extra labor fee except the travel cost and diagnostic fee, so it probably came out at about a wash.  I did sign up for the Guardian Maintenance Club.  But hats off to Allbritten for responding within 24 hours in 100 degrees heat when all the local businesses weren’t able to help😊<//review>< pics>

Called 3 other plumbing companies. They either couldn't/wouldn't fix the problem or were going to charge me an astronomical amount of money. Called Allbritton & Ebert came out and FIXED IT! Plus, it didn't cost me an arm and a leg to have it repaired. Calling them today for another issue. I'm sure ill get the same customer service.<//Review>

< review>
Our home was recently invaded by a family of rats looking to create their own watering hole in the attic by chewing through the Aquapex water line. With Fresno in a 4-year drought these creatures were looking for water in any place that they could find it. The leak they created made its way through the ceiling in the kitchen and caused us to seek an immediate repair.

Our insurance company recommended Allbritten, The Barefoot Plumber, so I we called to schedule an appointment. Meagan, in their Customer Service Department could not have been more efficient in ensuring that we had the earliest available time for their  specialist to make the the call. When Aaron arrived the next morning we were greeted by a friendly, knowledgable, and efficient plumbing repair person. Aaron went right to work to locate the leak, cut and replace the chewed section of Aquapex and make a leak test to further ensure that the job was properly completed. He then went out of his way to give us some background on rat behavior so that we could relay it to our pest control service and hopefully avoid a repeat performance.

Would we recommend Allbritten to another person in need of a plumbing problem? Absolutely, and with the knowledge that the job would be done right, completed on time, and reasonably priced. Their customer service staff and repair service personnel made a good outcome out of a bad situation. Way to go Allbritten!<//review>

Not happy with this company at all. My water heater sprang a leak on Thursday.  Called Allbritten on Friday , the 9th.  Jonathan came over and told me I needed a new tank but that they couldn't install it until Tuesday, the 13th.  I wasn't happy that I would be without hot water for four days but i told him OK go ahead.  He said that the total cost of the Bradford White tank would be $4,919.  I asked if they had financing without interest.  He said that I would have to ask Natalie at the office.  I called Natalie and she said that Jonathan could answer that question for me.  What, one hand doesn't know what the other is doing?  Jonathan finally gave me the answer about financing.  That night I called my son-in-law and he called his friend at Art Douglas Plumbing.   Someone from Douglas called me to inform me that Josh, the technician, would be there at 9AM next morning. Of course, I cancelled my order at Allbritten right away. Josh, came over at 9AM on Saturday as promised and I had a new BW water heater installed by 7PM that night. I didn't have to wait four days like I would have with Allbritten.  And, you know what?  I got it for $1200. less and a courtesy service of A/C and furnace for one year.  I'm sticking with Art Douglas Plumbing from now on because they know how to treat a customer.<//Text>

I work in Anaheim for one of the largest HVAC mechanical contractor in CA. I came to Clovis  this Memorial Weekend to visit an elderly lady whom I love and respect. She had Allbrittin to come and service her A\C unit. After signing a paper to allow the technician to tune up/check the AC.  The "service technician" who came to "tune up" the air conditioner was more interested in selling a complete new system than actually doing a honest job. After a song and dance of why she needed a new system because it would be better than fixing the unit, she got the getting $15,000 quote!!  She told him she would think about it, she was then told by "John" she only had two days to cancel. She asked him what did she have 2 days to cancel? He responded - for the credit approval of the $15,000 system. She did not approve or even ask for a credit check for a new ac system. She had to go to Allbritten's shop to cancel the job/credit request that she did not even authorize. This weekend I looked at the Lenox A/C unit and it is less than 14 years old. It is cooling the house fine. It is going to need fan motor replaced because the bearings are starting to go out on the motor and making noise. Replacing a $150 fan motor would of been the honest recommendation, but a lot of less money to be made. A replacement unit was pushed onto my loved one instead of a quote to fix the fan motor.  I am not sure of the lack of intergerity is just coming from the worker. I just want any older/elderly people to make sure you get at least 2 or 3 quotes before buying a new system.<//Text>

It WAS a technician that came out, and he did give her details and pricing of the option of repair, along with the option of replacing the unit. She decided to look into a new system. When our comfort advisor came out to the home to discuss the option of a new system, she informed him that her husband had passed and a family member was helping with financial affairs. John repeatedly asked if we could include this family member and repeatedly she refused and said she was capable of deciding herself. They discussed payment options and she decided on financing. They got her approval right there at her dining table, over the phone with the financing company. She filled out all the financing paperwork and signed it herself. John let her know that if she changed her mind, she had two days to cancel the job, as the terms and conditions explained on the paperwork she signed. She was fine with that. As he walked out the front door, he again asked if he could involve the family member helping with her finances and again she refused. She came in to our office on her own, and let us know when she arrived that she wanted to cancel the job. We gladly got her info and cancelled with no further questions asked. If she had called us to let us know she wanted to cancel, we would have gladly done it over the phone. Coming in was not a requirement at all. Our intention is NEVER to take advantage of, or push anyone into doing something they are uncomfortable with.  We went through all the proper steps and she understood everything. We are sorry to hear you feel this way, but our integrity is of utmost importance to us, and we would never want to do anything to go against that."}<//Resp><Date>1496035331282<//Date><UserId.>117641801722503325087</UserId.></record>

Allbritten is great. We needed to repipe our house. Our galvanized pipes were deteriorating and we had lead in some of our water. I interviewed four companies for the job. Repiping a house is a big job. I wanted to make sure we had it done right. Of the four companies interviewed, I chose Allbritten. I chose them because they had the best insights into repiping our house. I also chose them because they are a large company and I knew that, if anything should go wrong, they would take care of it. I also chose them because the plumber who came to talk to me about the job, Jimmy, was very professional, polite, and personable. We had a good rapport. He listened to my concerns and discussed solutions with me. I felt like he heard me and took my concerns seriously. He was knowledgeable about different technical details of plumbing which, I had found, other plumbers weren't aware. For instance, as I have learned, one should never join copper and galvanized directly together as the metals react and contribute to the deterioration of galvanized. Also, for instance, Jimmy pointed out that building standards are to use 95/5 solder when joining copper pipes and that there is *still* lead in 95/5 solder (5% of it is lead). His knowledge, and concern for my concerns, were great. When it came to doing the job, Allbritten's work was also great. Jimmy and his partner Dustin worked hard and intelligently. They cleaned up every day, leaving our house as undisturbed as possible. They were very polite. They were courteous. They did great work. All in all, our job proved to be much more involved than it appeared from the outset. Jimmy and Dustin had to put in several extra days of work, but Allbritten kept their word on their bid and didn't even bring up the issue or try to renegotiate. It is without hesitation that I recommend Allbritten. And if Jimmy is available, I recommend you request him. ONE LAST THING TO KNOW: the secretary at the company suggested I sign up for the "Guardianship Protection Program" which would cost about $250 and would (1) include the servicing of our air conditioners twice a year and (2) save us 15% on this very big job. Woohoo! Thank you, Allbritten, Jimmy, and Dustin!< /review>

You're right- it was a big job! Haha. But that's the great thing about our upfront flat rate pricing- the price that we give you for the work we  agree to is the price. Jimi is an experienced, knowledgeable plumber who loves what he does and it shows in his attitude, workmanship and how he treats our customers. We are fortunate to have him on our team.

Our techs and dispatchers are working long hours- evenings, weekends and holidays, as the radio ads state, but we couldn't possibly promise how quickly we can get there with this heat and all the calls we are getting."}</response><userid>112724290136233023896</userid><date>1503790057742<//date>< text>
I called because I needed an emergency repair and they just said that the soonest they can b here to check it is Tuesday.and today is Saturday.do they expect for my kids to suffer in the heat till they are ready to come and check it out smh false advertisements on the radio i do not recommend them</text>

We had only one phone number on file and called to tell you we were coming to your home, but when we got no response and left a message, we didn't send them out of town (Sanger), as is our policy. We are glad we were able to get you back on schedule and fit you in today, as we know the urgency with this heat! Looking forward to coming out there in a bit and helping you out with a second opinion on your a/c and hopefully get it cooling quickly! Thanks for still giving us an opportunity to serve you.

<text>I reached out to Scott's office I needed home insurance immediately. The receptionist was incredibly friendly and welcoming. I was then transferred to Sam Sinn.  We used an online video interface where he was able to share his screen so that I could see directly the different insurance options available. He was incredibly kind, patient and competent. Sam knows his products well and listened attentively to my needs. There was no pressure whatsoever in steering my choices. He educated me, clarified any questions that I had and spent the time to allow me to choose what felt right. I have never had such a warm, helpful and genuine interaction like this with any large company. I highly recommend this agency and asking for Sam to help you with your insurance needs.< /text><rate>5< /rate><name>Aiko Michot<//name><UserId.>102183419987244492337<//UserId.>< response>

I reached out to Sam Sinn to look into both professional insurance and renters insurance for my small business here in Eureka and first off I want to say that he has been the most responsive and helpful insurance agent I have ever dealt with! He laid everything out for me in a way that was digestible and  easy to understand. Something that otherwise was seemingly complicated, he made it simple. He responded so quickly and is also pretty witty and fun to chat with. I appreciate things made simpler in life. Thank you Sam and Scott Hammond at State Farm. I highly recommend.</text>

<text>When I was in need of insurance I reached out to the Scott Hammond firm because of positive reviews and others who mentioned their excellent service. I was put into contact with Sam Sinn who has gone above and beyond to help. Sam has provided the best customer service I could ask for and is the reason I ask if he is in when I call. However, every member I have spoke to when calling Scott Hammond has been friendly, professional, and reliable. I have not had a single frustrating call or poor experience with their staff. I have motorcycle and car insurance through this firm and could not be more thankful for the service I receive.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1621376162786, 'text': 'Thanks Aaron for the amazing insurance review for Scott Hammond State Farm in Eureka.

<text>The entire office is very welcoming.  I was greeted immediately upon entering by Jake (that was his name if I remember correctly), and every staff member made a point to greet me as well.  Jake was very attentive as I explained what I was looking for and that I was new to the area.  He was very knowledgeable and gave me any answers I needed, then connected me with Traci Day to help get a quote for a 4 plex in Eureka.  Traci was just as kind and knowledgeable as Jake was.  She couldn't get the quote drafted that day, but she immediately went to work getting all the information needed and had the quote ready for me the next day.  She was kind enough to email it to me since I couldn't come in right away, and made a point to follow up and welcomed me to come by the office to talk about the policy in person.  She's been a pleasure to work with, as has the entire office.  I highly recommend this office.</text>< pics>

<review>Where to being ..... I have had State Farm Insurance for over 10 years .... I started out with my original agent who set my standards very High with how I should be treated and how my agent acts ... well he decided to retire we went through 2 other agents who didn't work out.... well when it was time for me to renew and change my policy around so instead of fallowing up with me or helping me out she just assumed I would stay with her as my agent, she was about as helpful as a pot hole to a blind person ... I met Scott through work and told him about my state farm experience and how I was slacking about renewing my policy and getting one set right for me. THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT SCOTT he brought me back to the experience that I once had with my old agent, he would call and check in and see how everything was and if everything was going OK. basically I could actually believe again that if I did the like a good neighbor state farm is there ....I know Scott would show up and I would not be left in the dust waiting or hanging in limbo. every where I see Scott its a hey how are you and a great laugh. If you are looking for a state farm agent then go to Scott<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

While working with Scott back in '01- '03 he instilled in me that success could really only be achieved by treating your clients/customers with respect, integrity, honesty, and diligence - A formula that has worked well for me over the years and will work for anyone who has him for their Insurance Agent -< /review>

Knowing Scott for many years, I write this review based more on him and his team then State Farm per se, because you can get State Farm Insurance coverage online, in every town in the county or another brand of Insurance all together!

But? With Scott Hammond Insurance, you get Scott and his lovely team of dedicated professionals at your finger tips. Having Scott handle your needs, is like a butler on steroids... he is Thorough, thoughtful, resourceful and in my humble opinion? I honestly think he cares!

When considering your insurance needs, or reviewing your existing coverages, consider at least looking into Scott Hammond Insurance services... because let’s say he can’t beat your rate? Maybe your coverages aren’t very good, lack certain areas of coverage and when you need your insurance? It’s just not there like you thought it would be.</Review><gmap_id>0x54d155631aec29d1:0xb9f02fa0745156fe<//gmap_id><response>{'time': 1528557108620, 'text': 'Thank you Joe.

< Review>
No one likes to deal with insurance, it is sort of like going to the dentist. However, I must say dealing with these find fellows at Scot Hammond ins. and Daryl,  made it easy for my wife and I.
Scott has some find agents working for him. Daryl took the time to evaluate my insurance plans that were spread out with other careers, and saved me a bunch of money. You won't be sorry working with them. They are top notch.<//Review>

I've known Scott Hammond for years, both personally and professionally!  And he gets it!  He knows that integrity is #1; if people can't trust you, you're out of business.  And he knows service; what's in it for you, the client, is the only thing that keeps businesses open.  Call Scott.  You can trust him, and he'll give you all he's got!< /review>

Really nice mom and pop bakery. Great selection of cakes and cookies and Armenian pastries. We bought the coconut cream cake which was super light and fresh. The gentleman gave us a sample of the chocolate-dipped dried apricots which were seriously delicious. Will be sure to try some of their amazing looking Turkish Delight selection next time.< /Review>

Cannot sing high enough praises about this bakery!! The desserts were beyond delicious, she has completely mastered the art of savory treats with the soul cupcakes, and her whole family really contributes to the warm welcoming feeling you get when you step foot inside! We got a good mix of everything as you can see in the pictures! Cannot wait to go back. Everything was delicious and not a crumb was spared. Bree has absolutely knocked it out of the park with her first storefront. Cannot wait to see all the things the future holds for her!</Review>

< Review>
I ordered a cake for my 3 year old and I gotta say my expectation was no very high at first. I figure it was just another bakery place like many others. But oh boy do they have skills to blow your mind with most beautiful cakes ever.. It felt wrong cutting through the work of art they came up with for my boys birthday cake.. it was beautiful inside and out. Moist, sweet and flavorful.. i gotta say they are a bit pricey but it sure is worth it.. they have the skills to come up with the most original cakes and will blow your mind with the work of art their cakes are... visit them and if you have a cake request do it in a timely manner. They are popular and always busy. Their reputation speaks for themselves. Family own with professionalism to deliver a quality product..<//Review>

Great bake shop, everything tastes so good! Also great if you have a peanut allergy like myself, since they do not use peanuts in their products. Very happy.< /Review>

<Review>Bree made my wedding cake and around 300 cupcakes for our guests and everyone ranted and raved about how good they were. She’s also done a dessert table for my baby shower and all of the treats were delectable and so unique! She puts passion, deep care, hard work, and lots of her own personal touch in her work and it always comes out FABULOUS. You can’t go wrong with Bree’s Cakes!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Love, love, love this bakery! Such cute interior design! Staff is nice, friendly and helpful! Cupcakes had around six options, plus multiple cookie, cake pops and brownie flavors! And Brees specialties like Soul Cupcakes!! (Highly recommend but only there on Saturdays and sundays) plus her refreshing banana pudding! I’d recommend trying the strawberry shortcake cupcakes and the chocolate peanut butter! Will definitely be back, and know where to come for custom cakes!</review><gmapID>0x80c2997927889179:0x2983ddf4df9ea425</gmapID><response>None< /response>< pictures>

Finally made it! Soul cakes!! Bree,with baby Marley in arms, was so sweet! Mel was patient with me and my boyfriend while we couldn't decide what to get. Lol if you don't see the soul cakes, ask! I'm happy I mentioned to bree I was sad I missed them, she said they had them in the back!<//review>

<review>I was really bummed that I didn't get to try the famous "Soul Cupcakes" because I got there too early, but I got a six-pack of cupcakes and they were absolutely delicious! The cupcakes are made from a more mealy, cornbread-y type of cake, not your standard spongy Safeway Bakery cakes. All the buttercream flavors that Bree comes up with are so creative and always delicious (my personal favorite was the cinnamon buttercream on the churro cupcake!). I'm moving to LA in 11 months, and I'm not saying that I'm moving there just so I can come to Bree's Cakes more frequently, but I'm also not not moving there just so I can come to Bree's Cakes more frequently.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2997927889179:0x2983ddf4df9ea425<//Gmap_id></record>

Got to meet Bree at Lacookiecon she is amazing inside and out! Her desserts are on fire. My family devoured everything we purchased that same night. In her products it shows how much love and passion she has! #bestbaker I would give a million stars if I could!!! Can't wait for the storefront location😊<//Text>

Service was quick, and Jonathan got me out of there with what I wanted within minutes. He also did a great job at helping me keep my monthly bill the same which was my goal from the start.

Let me start by saying I am beyond impressed with the service I received from Marlo at the Eastvale location.  I was transferring over six lines from my previous provider of 14 years, and Marlo walked me through the entire process and found the best plan that worked for my family. In contrast to the way I felt whenever I made any changes with my previous provider I left feeling great about my purchase.  I needed to make changes to the account the following day and Marlo was there to take care of my families needs with a smile. He spent 5 hours with us due to a huge issue with my previous provider, he kept his smile, was patient and made sure we walked out with all of our needs met.  Thank you again Marlo!!< /text>

Got a Moto Z3 with an extra battery pack and a screen protector that I had to purchase and just pay the tax on the phone I believe in order for me to get the cell phone with no monthly payments I went with the unlimited plan on auto pay in order to pay $5 less a month which is going to be $75 from what I was told.. I also got the JBL speaker phone mod which was $80 and I only got it cuz of the great deal I got for my phone plus I was just billed for it which was added bonus to me. Thank you Verizon team.</text>

It was a great experience did everything I needed to get done for a short speedy visit. I told Erik I had a gym class and I needed to leave asap, he definitely understood and help me get in and get out. I gave him my word the next 2 or 3 devices I am eyeing to buy I will make sure to ask for his help upon my return.  Been with Verizon for 15 yrs now and I still am very happy with their service. I should ask to be on their next commercial lol 🤗. Will ask Erik to help ke put in a request 😆< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I have been a few Verizon stores and retailers before, and this is the best store by far.  The phone selections and service offerings wouldn't be different from other Verizon stores, the difference came from the staff.  The sales personnel helped me was Christian.  He was professional, friendly, and went extra miles to bring the phone cases out from the storage area to show me though he knew I wouldn't really purchase those.  His explanation of pro and cons of the programs were clear and straightforward, it didn't take long for me and my wife to make the decision.  The store management also texted me to follow up,  it was a good gesture of customer support as well.  Many thanks to Christian and the management team!< /Review>< pictures>

<time>1512092161668< /time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Went in after talking to Verizon on the phone and customer service told me I had to go to the store to deactivate a phone and transfer the contract to an open line with no contract on my account. When I went in the sales guy was very rude and said it was not possible. I asked him to call Verizon because notes were left. He said no I’m not calling because it’s not possible. So I asked for the Manager. He also didn’t call for me I had to call and Instead of trying to help he was trying to make a sale.  He also said it was impossible and the guy I called said no notes were taken and it couldn’t be done. Well I called the loyalty number and the first guy I talked to said sure no problem. 15 minuets later it was done and I got a $75 credit. Now I’m going to the corona Verizon to buy a new phone. Lost my business, too bad, it’s next to my house. All they had to do was make an effort and not be rude. Not much to ask for when their business weighs heavy on customer service.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Called Verizon to discuss upgrade. They said before you chose galaxy note 9 go to your local Verizon and hold the phone(small hands) see what it does and if you like it, then you can decide. So I get off the phone with Verizon and go to the local branch.
You can't even hold the phones,  theyre locked down from top to bottom left to right. An I asked am i able to hold a phone. They said no sorry ma'am..
We'll what's the heck did i just drive down there for. At&t is in the same parking lot so I went there and was able to check out the phone. Thanks for wasting my time verizon< /review>< response>

This was our experience at this store.
We have been Verizon's customers for many years at this location on Eastvale.
On 9/23/18 we went into the store at 6:40pm with the intention of upgrading two of our 10 lines. (We were never told when we came in, that the store closes at 7pm). At 6:55pm, this one guy name ALFRED comes out and with a very rude tone and attitude asked us, "are you guys going to buy something because we don't have anymore time for looky looky. We have to close the store". He said it to us, but loud enough for the other customers to hear.
I had the option to answer back to him in the same tone he used, which I'm pretty sure it would have scalated to a chain of very unfortunate events, so I decided to confront this issue in a more civilized manner.
We have being a satisfied customer for many years, and that's why we have over 10 lines. The problem is not the company itself but this kind of people working in the service industry, without the capacity or will to treat people with respect.
Our monthly bill with Verizon is $600+, equal or greater then this guy's weekly pay, who, based on his way to deal with the authority verizon has giving him shows he has no greater education than high school or a GED, the most.
We expect a response and solution from from Verizon to which we are pretty sure is not an isolated case.< /Text>

<Review>About 6 employees in the room that could've reminded future customers and current paying-members that it's the only day of the week they don't close at 8, but 7pm.

It's about a couple minutes till 7pm now and we're seconds away from our new Samsung s9+ but before we could ask for a sales agent, Alfred, man in charge apparently, comes up to us and says that the store is closing and there's no more time for "looky looky" 😂😂
Zero respect towards me and my father. As if we couldn't have been reminded in a different manner??
I told the guy, Alfred, who was apparently desperate to clock out, that we'll just upgrade another day. Assuming he's not too busy next time /:

<review>The male Employee completely disregarded my phone exchange within the first two minutes of me walking in to a completely empty store because I bought the phone online. He said it couldn’t be exchanged. I called Verizon (611) and even gave the phone to the 2nd female Employee and the store Employee told the Verizon representative her system would not allow the exchange without even checking her system. The Verizon representative disagreed with her on the phone and even questioned her. I left the store and Verizon phone support directed me to the Ontario store where my phone was exchanged without any issues or problems. Read the other reviews...customer service here is horrible. I’ll never return to this store again. Ontario Verizon is the place to go if you need help!<//review>< pics>

<Text>The only reason I'm giving 2 stars and not 1 is because Claudia is the best person I've ever interacted with. Everyone else at this store is blunt, rude, and won't help you. They claim that there's "policies" that don't allow them to do ANYTHING. I'm sure it's just the manager here because everywhere else does not treat you this badly! Whatever.

<Text>RUDE RUDE RUDE! It amazes me how some people in customer service do not even know the definition of customer service. This store is definitely "those" people. Do yourself the favor and drive to the Magnolia store in Riverside and give commissions to helpful people who actually deserve it. That is were I had to go for help. If you decide that customer service isn't important to you and you end up dealing with the store Managers Jesus or Jorge Corona at the store, pray that you will receive any sort of help because just like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz, they lack heart! Never again will I go here EVER!< /Text>< Pics>

I told him tons of times that i dont want to do the edge plan and he insisted and then lied about it. i was there for over an hour and a half and now i have to go back and fix what they lied about. i wish we could give negative stars!!!!</Review>

<Text>Don't ever buy ANYTHING from this store especially the Parrot Drone 2.0. It's defective and extremely overpriced. Employees don't know how to perform their job and provide proper customer service and give inaccurate information.  You can't return anything defective or damage,whether it be a phone/accessories/,or this Drone. Store manager Jorge G. Corona and manager Jesus are the most rude people I've encountered,yelling at us in store calling us liars,taking employees word over ours. VERY VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.</Text>< GmapID>

Went in to trade in my phone. I know these guys work off commission but the rep I had was very pushy. I just wanted to go in and out but we stood there for like 5 minutes straight going over every promo possible to which I replied no to all of them.

When it came down to buying my phone I realized I did not have enough funds on me and when the rep who was working with me heard this his attitude changed to visibly frustrated that he was about to lose a sale. This was my mistake regarding funds but cmon man you’re making the client feel uncomfortable.

I was able to obtain the funds to finish the sale but I felt awkward afterward because the rep didn’t do a good job at hiding his frustration and then tried to turn that into small talk.

The place got remodeled but there’s limited seating area, reps fighting for space to tend to their clients.

I just had an unpleasant experience, which I can’t say has always been the case for me at Verizon, generally they’re good, but I felt uncomfortable this time around.</text>

Thank you for being open 24 hours, I work till 2 or 3am... So going home to sleep and waking up to do laundry just isn't going to work out for me... (For me)... This place is nice and clean, the outside is well lit... I didn't feel like anything crazy was going to happen specially in the middle of the night...
Once again thank you for being open 24hrs...< /review>

Washing machines don't work that well,
Lost Money 3 times already. try calling owner
All you hear is a bunch of static on the phone.
No place to wash your hands. dryers work excellent it's coin operated bring lots of   ones
Because some of the washers eat up your Money and no way getting a refund. Nobody around to help you.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I appreciate a twenty-four hour laundry facility. I don't have your normal nine to five job. Great place to do your laundry in the early morning like 1am. Thank you to the owners of Riverside Coin Laundry. The washers were clean and the area inside was also well maintained. Thank you again. I recommend Riverside Coin Laundry to anyone living in the Riverside area that needs to do their laundry in the early morning.</text>< Name>

Bugs everywhere! Dollar/ Quarter machine is old and doesn’t want to take bills. The Dryer machine didn’t work and the out of order sign for it was a tiny piece of cardboard that was on the floor! I was in desperate need of washing a load, but this will be my last time coming. Only positive thing is that it’s open 24/7. Location is sketchy- there are homeless on the corner getting naked and smells like urine. (Dont recommend to come late at night)</review>

This is a very small laundromat with a tiny number of washers and very little space to fold your laundry. There are only four carts to move your laundry. There is a large dog tied to the end of the laundromat (you can't use the sink if you are scared of dogs). Some of my clothes came out stained from the washer and I had to take them somewhere else to clean them. On the pro side, washers are not expensive ($1.25) and there is a TV on to pass time. Please be aware that the area is not very safe.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I went to wash on a Saturday at 11 p.m. and the place is clean, quiet, many washing machines seem new, everything is fine, the only reason I give only 4 stars is that there was no softener in the machine 😐

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I hope this review saves you time and money. I  wanted to sell some old jewelry and obviously wanted the most for it.  I drove to the 5  different shops around me. Secured Jewelry and loan was the one that offered me the highest. They were very professional and made the experience very pleasant.
At the end I even bought a TV for a my kids at a great price.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>Bought an item here through Offerup. Got a good deal and it was easy to find. The place was clean and the sales people were good.

I brought it back for an exchange because I misplaced my receipt. They refused to exchange it stating, it didn't work when I brought it in. I explained it still has your sticker on it. They said anyone could put a sticker on it. Horrible customer service, they'll insult you and their power tools don't work.</review><pics>None< /pics></record>

<Text>If I could give them no stars I would. WORST PLACE EVER. Don't do bussiness with this place. They will tell you lies just to get a sale and won't give you your money back for something that don't work but yet they guaranteed it would. They insult you and laugh in your face. Very rude and disrespectful people who work here and have the worst customer service ever.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<review>This location is very clean and well maintained. Bathrrom is even clean and everything works. I feel that my belongings are safe and well looked after and the customer service is excellent. Josie has really gone above and beyond to make sure that my needs are met, she is such a sweet and very genuine lady. I am very satisfied with my experience at this public storage so far.<//review></record>

Josie is always so kind and upbeat every time we visit the facility.  She always greets everyone to see how they are doing and asks if there is anything we need at all times. She provided excellent customer service at all times. The facility is always kept up which is great. Please consider changing the hours to  open earlier and stay open later.</review>

Cathy was a great help on Sunday.  Due to COVID-19 I could not see the actual unit but they had a virtual image on the table.  I realized what I reserved was going to be too tight for my items so I decided to upgrade to the next size.< /review>

I have rented here several times as I live near by and my business requires me to need storage space often. John has been super helpful, accommodating  and understanding to our business and personal needs. The units are always cleaned and ready for entry. I also appreciate the safety, security and location. I will definitely continue to rent from here.</Review>

I've also had questions/concerns that were not only addressed but taken care of before I got the chance to approach the management, meaning John was paying attention to the property and took the initiative to rectify the issue BEFORE I said a word. That was extremely comforting to my family and myself. My family, and I, have occupied a space for 10 years; this location is the one I've recommend to my friends and neighbors! Good Job!

<review>Very clean and safe feeling property managed very well also friendly staff. Great prices on units and options for different sizes. The process to reserve the unit was very easy and the manager took the time to work with me on coming to see the unit and finalizing paperwork. After arriving we did a tour of the site while he explained everything which was very simple and reasonable. The unit was cleaned very well for me and finalizing everything was quick and easy. I would definitely recommend public storage for any storage needs thanks chelsea<//review><userid>112398807915141442272</userid><user_name>Norman Thompson</user_name>< Rate>

I always have a good experience when I'm using the facilities here. John is always on top of things and he's always a friendly face to see there to make things better and safer. It's a good deal regardless - however, John is a huge reason that I stay very pleased with dealing with Public Storage.... Thumbs up and all stars 😀< /text>

from the moment I drove up I was already happy. Clean and safe with very helpful staff. Chelsea was sure to explain everything I needed to know in a very efficient pace since I was on my way to work. It was quick but I felt that I was very well informed and I made it to work on time thanks to Her. Great amazing place. Prices are great, staff is great, and the facility is beautiful. Highly recommend.</text>

Fairly satisfied with the storage manager, John, he has a super awesome personality! He provides excellent customer service skills, and I would definitely recommend this place to others due their ability to accommodate your needs that would best suit you.< /Text>

<Text>Great place to do business with, prices always changing sometimes more, most of the time lower than other storage places. Had a unit for 3 years until I finally bought a house and when I did I wasn't trying to pay storage an extra month so they helped close account before the first. Thanks to the whole team there for my storage needs!</Text></record></dataset><record>

When it appeared that i had forgotten to secure my storage space he used his lock to make sure that the contents would be safe.  I would definately return to PS and this location for any storage needs.  I look forward to talking to  John again.<//Review>< gmapID>

I just want to say that Susan is the absolute best !
She is so kind and Positive and made my experience very pleasant !!!
Susan Miller is a go getter and kind soul
She has personality and flare
You rarely get great service these days and it’s refreshing to be able to have a real conversation and be treated with respect.
So thank you very much for such a great experience Susan.<//review>

Both my husband and I had great customer service provided by Nicole! She was super nice and even took time out of her lunch break to help us. She also made it a fun experience and was really informative on all the details. I would definitely recommend this location. Everything looks clean and easy to access your stuff. Location is very convenient also.</Review>

My dad has been renting a storage unit here for a couple years now! The staff is great Nicole and Destiny are very helpful. We have been late on our payment a couple of times but didn’t even realize that auto pay was an option, the last time we came in they let us know about auto pay and since then we haven’t had any late payments!! If you need to rent a storage this is a good location to visit with great customer service!< /review>

<text>Came here to buy boxes for moving out of my apartment of 7 years. You dont realize how much stuff you have until you need to move. Sarah in the office was very helpful and extremely nice. The storage pack was very useful. Lots of boxes and I used the big one for my kids stuffed animals. Could fit lots of stuffed animals in that one box. Very happy.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Outstanding service, hands down.

I had the pleasure of Jen helping me out.

I was on a time constraint and she was very eager/flexible to assist and make things easier.

Customer service was amazing, she was very easy to talk to and understood everything.

Absolutely the best service I've come across!

Thank you Jen! :)< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Have been a long term customer. Have never had any issues. Nicole had always been super helpful. Just met Jennifer and she is really nice. These ladies are great to deal with and talk to, they always keep me informed and when they call to remind me they are not rude. Will always come back love these girls.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808515e3f54af947:0xa14a83b78e8abb19</Gmap_id></record>

We have had this Public Storage since 2012 and just vacated 2018 . I want  to say that I have received very good service with Nicole.  She has always been very helpful, especially when my lock would not work; she is friendly and easy to talk to and work with. Thank you! Nicole made my stay pleasant!< /review>

Had a great experience opening my unit at this public storage have had many public storage's in the past this one by far has the friendliest customer service and easily the most persuasive and skilled sales staff regarding materials locks Etc they gave me the actual size of stores that I would need based on my request and didn't over sell me I just had a great experience I highly recommend Tessa and Public Storage on Western.</text>

<Text>I guarantee to finally take the time to share what I happened when I came into seek about storage. Jen was definitely a sweetheart in spirit. She has a great personality and knows how to assure customers they are at the right place. She knows her job and was very professional with a great sense of humor. I am humbled by my experience and in would recommend this storage to others.<//Text>< Pictures>

My experience with public storage has been excellent. The manager Nicole has been a life saver. She does her job very well. She goes that extra mile for her customers with customer service out of this world. Makes me feel so welcome everytime I come by. And the feeling of safe with my valuables stored there. She needs a raise.< /Text>

Out of all storage facilities I've done business with this facility is by far the best in CUSTOMER SERVICE throughout Fairfield. Trust Me I've had the worst of the worst of customer service. I've been a CSS for many years and have extensive knowledge in this area and I'm always alert to great customer service. The customer service I've received other facilities is really unbelievable.
I want to thank the chelsa here at public storage for treating me good and for the excellent job in their takeover and tell them ""AWESOME JOB"" IN CLEANING THIS FACILITY UP, MAKING THINGS MORE SECURE AND FOR BEING AT THE TOP OF ALL OTHER FACILITIES AROUND THIS AREA!!!<//Text>

Just wanted to thank Nicole and Jennifer. Came in to see if there was a size available for my move. Unfortunately at the time they were all taken, however, customer service was great. Unit and property were clean, all my questions answered professionally, and best of all Nicole and Jennifer were very pleasant to meet.

Will definitely be coming back to store.< /text>

<text>Nicole was very informative and helpful. The exterior of the buildings were well maintained and the units themselves looked secure. Knowing she is onsite also made me feel at ease. This Public Storage was also $40/month cheaper than the one on Beck AND has $1 for the first month!! Looking forward to my furniture's stay :)<//text><user_name>Danette Burch<//user_name><Gmap_id>0x808515e3f54af947:0xa14a83b78e8abb19< /Gmap_id>< date>

<Text>I had my life's treasures in storage for almost three years. From day one Nicole was helpful in the transition.  I never felt uneasy about getting into my storage unit, very secure.  As I transition again both Jen and Nicole have been very helpful.

Hands down the greatest Public Storage experience of my life, and believe you me, I have had many. The employees were easily the most courteous people I have ever encountered, and probably the sexiest Public Storage professionals I have ever laid eyes on. Not to mention they knew the answers to pretty much all of my questions. Except when my Son asked which Pokemon Xatu evolved into. They didn't know that one.

I had a bunch of stuff to store, and I got it all done. THANKS PUBLIC STORAGE</review>

Very friendly staff at both Beck Ave and Western St. these ladies helped me knowing I was in a tight place financially and even though I didn't end up using the unit due to a miracle for my family if I had to get a unit somewhere I would use public storage in Fairfield!! Thanks Ladies!!<//Review>

Byron at Fairway Mortgage has been a pleasure to work with in the purchase of our home in Shasta County.  He is very professional and easy to communicate with, always taking time to return calls and emails and explain everything in the escrow process in easy to understand language.  I would go as far as to say he is the best mortgage agent in Shasta County.   Also need to mention his assistant Peggy who gets five stars - coordinating everything!  I highly recommend this team for your mortgage needs - professional, highly competent and friendly.  - Rick< /Review>

Byron has been with us since the beginning. Our credit was not in the range to buy a home. He walked me through the steps and gave me sound advice on what to do to get ready to purchase.  It took almost one year but we just closed escrow today. Very friendly, knowledgeable and makes the buying process easy.</review>

<review>During these trying times of Covid 19, Byron helped me get my first time home buyer mortgage. He answered every phone call and every question I had following the call. He made the complicated process of getting a home mortgage the most simple it could get as he knows the processes like the back of his hand. I would personally recommend him to prepare anyone who is interested in buying a home’s mortgage.<//review><pics>None</pics></record>

We recently refinanced our home and would like to thank Byron for the incredible job he did and the effort he put out.  Whether you’re buying or refinancing your home, it is important to shop around for your lender.  With that being said, Byron should be your first call.

I contacted seven different lenders during this process.  No one was able to come close to the value or level or service that Byron provides.  He was the only lender willing to make phone calls to tell me what rates were at, what the market was currently doing,  Or what to expect in the process.  I sincerely wish I had his phone number when we purchased the house, but I’m grateful we found him for our refinance and I encourage anyone who reads this to contact him.  If you’re new to the process, he his by far the most helpful lender you will find.

In terms of value, he led the pack with the lowest fees.  When I contacted him and told him we were shopping around, he was willing to lower his fees right out the gate to stay competitive.  He said from the beginning that if we could show him a lower rate, he would do whatever he could to beat it.  True to his word, he stayed competitive to the very end.  When we closed, we got the rate that we wanted for about $900 cheaper than his competitors.

Byron by far was the most professional, responsive, and competitive lender I contacted.  His customer service was absolutely phenomenal and if you’re new to this process, he is absolutely the person to call.  Byron, thank you so much for all your help and for helping us to lower our monthly payment!<//Review>

Exactly what you want in a Lender. Present when you needed help and happy to make the magic happen in the background without making life more complicated for you. Couldn't be happier with the interaction and transaction. Thanks Byron.</Review>

<review>My husband and I were in escrow on a home that fell through over a year ago and we recently closed on our dream home! Byron had remained in contact with us over the last year with market updates, so when it came time to find a lender we knew exactly who we'd call! He's good at his job and always on top of things. If you call him on Saturday night he'll answer, shows a lot about his work ethic. I'd highly recommend Byron, not only is he knowledgeable but generally a nice and personable guy!<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Byron did an excellent job helping us on our journey to home ownership. We looked in several cities at different types of homes. In each circumstance he advised us issues we could run into and provided pre-qual letters with each deal. Finally we found our home. He stayed ahead of all the requirements and we closed the transaction without any delays or issues. He is very knowledgeable and I highly recommend him and his team. Thank you!</text>

We can’t recommend Byron highly enough! We felt like our home buying process was in great hands as he is incredibly thorough and trustworthy. Escrow  was very sticky and tricky, he advocated for us with the underwriters and with the buyer! We were on the phone a lot with him, and every time we were greeted with warmth, honesty, and wonderful communication. He was so patient with us as we were on a learning curve of the whole lending process - kind to us with all of our questions and concerns. Byron is fabulous and we recommend him wholeheartedly!<//review>

Byron was our mortgage broker when we first bought our house a few years ago. After we had signed everything, he told us he’d let us know if he could ever save us some money if rates went down. True to his word, he gave us a call a couple months ago and when everything was said and done, he helped us save almost $600/month by refinancing! Byron is great to work with, easy to reach, friendly & enthusiastic. It’s obvious he loves what he does and he’s good at it! We highly recommend him - thank you Byron!< /text>

We are so glad our realtor recommended Byron to us as a Loan Officer! We went to him when we needed to purchase our home when we had to suddenly relocate our family for work. We had him help us refinance for a lower interest rate 6 months later.
We believe the stress of buying our new home at a new area, along with relocating our family,  would’ve been more stressful if we didn’t go to a reliable and knowledgeable Loan Officer. Don’t hesitate to give him a call if you are looking to purchase a new home or refinancing your house.</Review>

<Review>This guy rocks!! He will do everything you need and then some. We highly recommend. even after all the crazy unforseen hoops we had to jump through, (going through three different loans, long story) he never gave up until we found the right one. He was fast and efficient. 10 stars if it were possible. Thanks Byron!!!!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

So thankful to have a guy like Byron help us with the purchase of our first home! We had no idea what we were doing and he gave us all the instructions. Always there every step of the way and answered every question we had.
Thank you for everything Byron!

Thank you so much!

We have worked with Byron for the past 4 years now! We have bought and refinanced two houses with him and he makes the process a breeze. He is extremely knowledgeable and experienced. He was there to answer any and all questions we had and always responded quickly to either call or text!  Thank you Byron!< /text>

<Review>This was my 2nd time using byron as my mortgage lender. I don't plan on buying or selling a house again but, if I did I would use him again without thinking twice. He kept me well informed throughout the whole process and was very easy to get ahold of. I highly recommend Byron!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

A friendly, healthy Korean "rice bowl" style counter service restaurant. Servings are generous, suprisingly good and cooked to order. The delicious vegan bowl contains charbroiled tofu, crisp veggies, brown rice, and is lightly topped with teriyaki sauce. The bowl is also available with Kobe beef or skinless chicken breast meat. Fresh chives and avocado may be added. All proteins are charbroiled. Brown rice or polished (white) rice are interchangeable. Two hot sauces and a Teriyaki sweet sauce are offered. Wheelchair accessible including a gender neutral bathroom requiring a security code, which is printed on your cash register receipt. Easy, free wheelchair accessible parking in two lots. A short tunnel connects.< /review>

<rate>5</rate><review>Been going here nearly every weekday in the afternoon since late March 2019 due to strictly monitoring my caloric intake. Food is good and consistent; staff is nice, courteous, and professional. Water is filtered and cold, even without ice. Patrons here can sometimes be messy (like most places), but staff keeps things clean. I've been served by the owner a few times, who is kind and jovial.

As to what I order, I religiously order 1 chicken & veggie bowl with brown rice and no green onions. I top it with hot sauce, triple hot sauce, jalapenos, and black pepper. (Yes, I like it hot, even as tears start coming out out.) Staff knows me by sight now and knows what I'll be ordering.

I hate avocado, but they serve it here and people order it frequently enough so I guess it's good. I've also had the beef bowl, the half & half, and plate-size portions before. All are good; the orange slice and salad on the plate are simple but surprisingly refreshing, which is kinda' Flame Broiler in a nutshell.

This place is my peaceful little lunch getaway from work and generally the highlight of my work day. Parking in the plaza is pretty bad but I walk here for lunch anyway!

Protip: The restroom code is printed out on your receipt, but I'm assuming no one notices that. Staff will readily give the code to customers when asked anyway.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Cashiers r amazing!the magic sauce does the trick!!... The person that cooks decides if throw away food or save it and still serve it the next day (owner orders keep it and serve it nextday)This happens most of the time with rice, meats and vegetables. Found bugs inside vegetables. Make sure u ask for fresh cooked food.< /review>

Ok food, down side is the hispanic lady cashier has a big mouth  and bad attitud making bad comments about me with the cook in the kitchen,  after i place my order,  i asked her why i got overcharge for broccoli, when i asked her to substitute the rice for more broccoli,  she was telling the cook that should go get and shut my mouth and just pay and stop been dramatic and if i didn't like it i should go somewhere else , i guess this ignorant low IQ with the ridiculous name of "MILAGRITO" she doesn't care about people's business, what an idiot, instead of talking bad behind customers back she should get to work and clean the tables because they were all dirty, i won't return to this location or recomend at all<//review>

Visit this place since my friend suggest it. I like the interior design! Have a really good combination of eastern style and modern style.
Food: dumpling is good! I like it, but the rest of the food is ok, not very outstanding, look not authentic Chinese food, too oily, plain flavor
Service: 4/5 not good not bad
The restroom is really disgusting!! Not one keep it clean, which I worried about the safety and hygiene of the kitchen.< /Text>

My favorite restaurant of all time. Hands down. Food is never too overwhelming with sauces or spices. Everything is right for my taste buds. Recently, I went there and they had a special menu for supporting the LGBT youth community. I ordered from them many times and nothing had ever gone wrong. They also do a lot of themes and charity events, which are great!</Text>

<Review>Not a place I would recommend for authentic Chinese food. The food is Chinese fusion. I think many people go to the restaurant because of Martin Yan's name.

The interior decor of the restaurant is unique. My favorite is the big antique bell at the bar. The seating, however, is very uncomfortable. The tables are placed too close to each other, with little room for people to walk through. The dishes look & sound creative, but the taste is really unimpressive.

For the price it charges, the customer service of this restaurant is disappointing! Most staff are courteous, but they don't know how to serve. When serving the soup, the usual Chinese etiquette is to pour the soup for all the guests at the table. But the server just put the soup and utensils on the table and left. Moreover, the Latino looking woman literally dropped the bowl of sauce in the middle of the table, and didn't even apologize for her rudeness.

Overall, the service and the food don't live up to M.Y. China's name.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808580860ca8f4fb:0x170fd44206b9ead1<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

< review>
Awesome spot!!! It is truly hard to go wrong with restaurants here in San Francisco. There are so many options to choose from, especially in this area and in the mall. Very pleased with the decision to follow the Chinese craving! This is a more upscale Chinese restaurant with a variety of rice, noodle, soup, meat dishes to choose from. We made the decision to eat here simply because of how good the food looked while walking by. Presentation of the dishes was very nice and the flavors were even better!! Service was average but the food made up for it. They have some of the best chicken wings I've ever had. Noodles were also delicious! If you are looking for a good meal while at the mall, I definitely recommend checking M.Y. China out!!</review>

Tasty, but fairly overpriced. The Peking roast duck and wild boar noodles were the standouts. Wonton soup was pretty bland. Ambiance is a bit strange too, given that it’s crammed in a mall. If you feel like having upscale grub next to a bunch of consumer mall zombies this is your place.< /Review>

China is more suited for people with a heavy taste, hence why many dishes at this restaurant are spicy. Service was a bit slow but servers were quite friendly. They do have quite a verity of tea unlike most Chinese restaurants where they only serve you one kind of tea. The deserts were quite good. Although the green tea tiramisu did not have much of a green tea flavor to it. Overall, this is an okay place. Great for people who love spicy food though.</text>< Pics>

The dining area definitely started to get more packed while we were eating.
1) tea smoked pork belly sliders: good but there is no hint of tea flavor. The bao is soft and well steamed, but the pork belly is ordinary if not slightly bland.
2) Wild Boar Scissor Cut Noodles: the wild boar is diced into small indistinguishable pieces that it almost seemed like an afterthought in the dish. The noodles and sauce were unexpectedly commonplace in texture and flavor.
3) Dan Dan noodles: thin noodles are served cold in a peanut sauce. A lot of restaurants serve this differently, and this one is of the less notable versions.
4) Mushroom with spicy sesame sauce: the mushrooms have a great meaty texture, but one could not taste any sesame. The sauce instead bordered on the glossy sweet side.
5) eggplant and tofu clay pot: would definitely recommend for the soft tofu dredged in cornstarch and gently fried. The eggplant in the dish is cooked well
6) Yang zhou fried rice: delicious but very ordinary. Easily found and replicated by many restaurants.
7) Peking roast duck: the skin is crisp and well done. Also recommended.

M.Y. China is one of the better mall restaurants but certainly sits average among the category of americanized Cantonese food. While I will probably not return due to the conventional menu and flavors, I can definitely see it as a good alternative to the less exciting options at the mall.<//review><gmap_id>0x808580860ca8f4fb:0x170fd44206b9ead1< /gmap_id>< response>

Pleasantly surprised by this place! My friend and I were starving and decided to just walk into this place. Wasn't sure what to expect but turned out to be pretty good! Walnut shrimp and eggplant hot pot is definitely worth trying!< /Review>

Located in SFO downtown inside the mall this Restaurant has good ambiance, nice design, open kitchen and serving delicious and tasty food. Food is not oily and no strong taste which is really good. Good vegetarian options are available. Spicy chicken wings were my favourite.< /Review>

Top dishes: pork juicy dumplings were incredible, the salt egg yolk crab was to die for, the basic sautéed bok choy and eggplant done to perfection.

The garlic lobster was a bit overrated and definitely not worth the price - definitely go for one of the crab dishes instead.

All in all, I’ll be back here many times again.<//Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Inside Westfield on 4 floor.
Came for dinner on a Tuesday night but wasn't to busy (was told due to coronva virus) still was busier than any other resturant.
Food was quite decent using fresh ingredients.
It's not a typical Chinese restaurant with most dishes having a spin on traditional dishes.
Overall it's worth a spot worth visiting.< /text>< Pics>

Beef noodle soup is amazing, the rest is just okay. Juicy dumplings have cucumber at the bottom which kinda sucks.</Text>

<Review>Food is so great here. Service is great too. The server guy offered me some hot sauce and my god that tasted really good. I love their spicy chicken wings and the juicy dumpling. Honey glazed walnut shrimp is something that you should give a try to. Also their matcha tiramisu and custard egg lava bun is amazing. Though new to chinese food, they totally took me offguard with their brilliant taste. It deserves more than 5 stars. Amazing.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvwq8f3ga-YQfWK_xdQ_otffWLWHuXmwT35VKy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNq-qhf6sf6HOZWCNuvM2af9szYnHZTict9RCvE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1Soaceyq5Okxc-OfkK88uv7-OfnYrN9QeCK1z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz_kT-_6ZtslCQ_KzLomT8KI_O3G3IFUx6qAVt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuFLhi1iFkzH3D1QmsIOG6-51uhuC8YtI_o0Ub=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxmhrWMlnztqF5-lsaa9OiZ4L-W-dL8pYcxWJT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808580860ca8f4fb:0x170fd44206b9ead1</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

It was pretty empty both times I’ve went. If you’re in the mall and want a sit down restaurant for Chinese food that isn’t fast food like the ones in the mall dining hall, this is the spot to go to.

Food isn’t too greasy and I can easily see a repeat visit in the future for a quick bite.</Review>

I cant say enough about how much I love this place. Everything is made fresh, including (and especially) the noodles. The soups are flavorful and delicious, the entrees are elegant. But one of my favorite things here is the spicy crispy tofu...I could eat that all day long! My China is on the 4th floor of the Westfield mall, so if you're having a hard time finding it, take the elevator to the 4th floor (under the dome). There is sometimes a wait, but it's usually only 10-20 mins and it's worth it!</review>

I always forget MY China when I choose where to eat in SF. But with the horrible air quality, we decided to stay inside Westfield Mall after getting off of BART. And I'm glad we did. Sadly we missed Happy Hour (Monday-Friday 3-6PM, mostly discounted alcoholic drinks).

I highly recommend the Da Dao "Big Knife" Seafood Noodle - stir-fried noodle with generous portion of seafood (scallop, squid, shrimp), shiitake mushroom (my fav), baby oyster mushroom, pea sprouts and stringy egg. Such good work flavor! It was good to eat with other saltier dish as it was a bit bland, so I asked for some chili sauce and that definitely elevated the dish. Must-try! Eggplant tofu clay pot had pieces of soft, lightly fried tofu with chunks of eggplant. It was a soy sauce-based dish, and had some basil for flavoring; a little oily though.

Overall, great American Chinese food! But of course it was more expensive than your usual Chinese restaurant. Also they make interesting cocktaiIs. If you are a drinker, try to make it to Happy Hour.</Review>

<text>Underwhelming, but not bad food. The price point seems to be okay for “elevated” dim sum, definitely cheaper than Yank Sing. We ordered pot stickers, XLB, a cold noodle dish, crispy pork buns, and lava egg buns. Would probably only order XLB again but what is unusual about them, they serve them in spoons with a cucumber under the dumpling. It was a bit strange to me.<//text>< Time>

I wouldn't go back.

First , service was super slow and did-engaged.  We sat and waited a lot and had to ask for help.  Took 20 minutes after we were seated to get our water and first drink.  And that was after asking for it twice.

Food is hit or miss.  But sweet and sour pork was super chewy.  My beef noodle soup, the beef was excellent, but the broth was meh'

Seating can be really really tight.  We pretty much had dinner with the people next to us.

< review>
Shopping in Westfield mall and ran across MY China, tantalizing aromas wafted through the air and drew us in for a quick bite. Lots of seating both inside and out. Ordered the hot and sour soup and pork dumplings. Prompt service and very tasty food.< /review>

<time>1574393557861< /time><review>Actually wasn't planning on eating in the mall. Too busy, too touristy. We remembered we hadn't been to this spot and decided to come to M.Y. China. Sat at the bar and ordered Bang Bang Chicken Wings and Da Dao Noodles, amazing! We also had a Trio Juicy Dumplings, yes please!! To drink we had several, but I would recommend the Sunset at Eight for something sweet and the Moon on Bloom if you want something "spirit forward". Must go!!< /review>< gmapID>

Went here for lunch after a recommendation from a friend, and it was pretty decent. I had the Wonton Soup and Wild Boar Lettuce Cups. Both items were nice, but not that filling. Guess it was my fault for picking something small, but I was also trying to eat healthy, and everything on the menu seemed so high in calories!
One of my friends had the Kung Pao Chicken and the other had a vegetarian item, and both said their food was amazing, and filling too.<//Text>

<review>Best happy hour downtown as far as I’m concerned. It’s 3-6 during the week, drinks $7 and small plates $6. The choices are limited but what you get is amazing. Bang bang chicken wings are the bomb and I don’t even like chicken wings. Ditto for the spring rolls. Go!!!</review>< Date>

<user_name>Alice Kelsey</user_name><Review>Hiding in a shopping mall, M.. China was an amazing find.  As you as you get there, you know you've made a great decision as it smells fantastic.  It is very clean and contemporary.  The menu offers classics and riffs on classic,  if you want to try something new, for example taco appetizers where the flavors were all Chinese but the delivery a surprise. Most amazing mall food I've ever had.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

<Text>Located in the shopping mall. The jasmine Collins was quite good, although personally I would add more of jasmine instead of citrus notes. The dumpling wrappers were delicate and thin with generous amount of fillings. The egg custard lava Bao was absolutely the star of the show: gooey, warm, sweet, silky smooth egg custard paired perfectly with the dough. The Bao dough is very good: fluffy, soft, like a cloud.
For de desserts. Tea infused crème brûlée was okay, not very strong tea flavor. Vietnamese coffee ice cream was neither strong or creamy. It was watery, sugary sweet with not that much of coffee flavor.

Overall, good place but a bit overpriced for Chinese food.< /Text><name>Quynh Tra My Nguyen</name>< Pics>

This restaurant is owned by chef Martin Yan who brings regional tastes of China.  I have dinned here several times. I find the food to good quality and tasty. They offer hand made noodles.

Offer plenty of unique flavor and dishes that can't be find outside around the SF Bay area. For me, the night I went their offer a special selection of different flavors to cook the crabs. The flavors and ingredients are originated from different provinces of China.< /review>

<Text>I went there since the first day they opened. The twin scallops fried rice always my favorite. And cocktail East Meets West that a tea based cocktail taste fresh and great. It actually changed. When I order those sea food dishes were always got more than now at the same price. But still worth it since they use the fresh food materials.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I eat here a lot since I work in the area. I like how their service is always good and they keep the place well organized regularly. Prices are convenient and they serve sizeable portions.< /Text>

We have eaten here many times over the years, and the quality is always excellent.  We eat here at least once every time we visit SF (We don't have quality Chinese food where we live).  Our favorite dishes?  Chairman Mao's Chicken, Scissor cut noodles, the Pork juicy dumplings and the Sichuan Green beans are some of our favorites.  We tried the Honey Walnut shrimp this time and it was excellent as well.  We will return!!!< /text>

<user>107411364563910266990<//user>< Review>
At the suggestion of a concierge, we ordered from MY CHINA. First, they delivered only part of the order. They ran out of one of the dishes and never called to ask us if we wanted another option. So, they delivered Szechuan green beans which were quite spicy. They also delivered General Mao’s chicken which was described in their menu as “crispy with Sweet and Sour sauce. In fact, it was so spicy that it was inedible. So disappointed. We’ll tell the concierge not to recommend this spot again<//Review>

Mysterious vibes in the restaurant, the lighting is dark. Good for parties, friends meet ups. The  waiters were decent friendly. Noted here, the dandan noodles are served cold with sliced carrots on top which is different from originals and its not so meaty, but still worth a try. The crab dumpling was placed over a pice of veggie, server with a kind of red sweet/sour liquidish sauce, the dumplings were juicy as you would expected but fairy decent taste. Would recommend it if you wanna have dumplings once a while. Also connivence location, its located on the top floor of westfield. Right next to the elevator, easy to found. Different from the open fast restaurants on the F1, it is actually a well-decorated American Chinese restaurant.< /Text>

Our first encounter was the maitre'd who rudely told us WE WERE LATE. What a greeting and welcome to the restaurant. Not appropriate for any restaurant to tell it's customers. She needed lessons in hospitality. Food and waiter service was excellent. Thank you for that.</Text>

<review>Good food and good service.  We scored a photo with Martin Yan.  Food was served quickly.  We had the seafood iron pot and Rockfish.

Our waitress, Chelsea, was unpretentious but attentive; neither my wife nor I like waiters and waitresses hovering over us and checking in.<//review>< Pics>

<review>This is from a regular or used to be a regular MY customer. Went back last night after several months and sat at the bar as usual; same crew but they don’t remember us.

We ordered the regular (menu had not changed), food volume has shrank tremendously together with our regular martini. Although the martini glass is the same, how pathetic since martini can always be watered down.

This will definitely help cover the rent but losing regular customers like us at the same time.  Cheers.<//review>< pics>

<text>Mr Yan greeted us at the bar last night and took time to chat about the food, the giant bell and how he got it from a rural temple in China, his amazing energy levels and great blood pressure numbers!

His enthusiasm about the food is infectious and the food self was very good as always. There is a great variety and a great amount of creativity in the offerings and we always have a wonderful meal there.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Delicious food - tried various types of noodles from different regions - the closest I could get to Chongqing noodles was Dan Dan noodles served cold. They came not very spicy so I added in chili oil. Martin Yang came by our table and talked with us and ok it the different regions and encouraged my boy friend to try the chili oil. Overall good restaurant, food and drinks! Very cool to meet the Martin Yang!<//Text><Response>None</Response>< rating>

Salted egg is a amazing ingredient. It can promote the taste of other ingredients. The noodle is not slender one，it is short and wide. The taste is not bad. But I cannot tell the difference of the wild pork. It is just like the normal pork. Depends on that，it is a little pricey.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Great restaurant. Had dinner with a group of co-workers and this was a very nice place. We got a number different dishes and all shared which was nice. We also had a couple of native Chinese people and they confirm the food was good. I highly recommend the squid ink pasta and the steamed dumplings. Well worth checking out.</review>

This is a hidden gem for me. I found this place by chance last fall while attending a conference at the Moscone Center and had to come back while at this years conference.
The staff is friendly and helpful, the food is pretty good for 'mall food'. They have a pretty big menu and the atmosphere is great.
I highly recommend trying it at least once. You won't be disappointed.< /Review>

Really good, authentic Chinese food representing various types of local cuisine. Drinks there are great too. A little pricey for a Chinese restaurant but it's a high end white table cloth place so prices are totally in line.<//review>

Great as always!! Food / drinks / appetizers and SERVICE. Sorry I was not able to get the name of our "happy hour" waiter. First time I saw him. He's good / gladly attends "with a smile" to the customers' needs -- a real asset to MY China.</review>

<review>Came here from a high recommendation to show my family the art of pulling noodles. The chef was done pulling for the day, but fulfilled my request and made my daughter and very happy girl. It was nothing short of an incredible show. We sat at the noodle bar and watched them create many beautiful dishes. Our food was nothing short of spectacular. My 10 year old trying wild boar, pork belly and many incredible dishes. I ordered a number of small dishes to try and not one disappointed. And the Service? INCREDIBLE! A must visit destination.</review>< Pics>

The food here was very tasty and the service very friendly. We were here on a Saturday evening and it was super busy.  Yet they found a place for us so that we could eat. The flavors are perfect and the food is well finished. Highly recommended if you are in San Francisco and like to eat Asian food.<//review>

This is a Chinese restaurant inside the Westfield mall under the iconic windowed dome over the former Emporium Capwell department store.  Service was good.  Portions were good.  The food was delicious.<//review>

< review>
I've been here a couple of times and in general I like the food a lot. It's in a fun location, which might make it feel a bit commercial, but I enjoy coming here to eat.

The food itself is generally pretty good. Can't go wrong with the dumplings, my favorites being the pork juicy dumplings or the BBQ pork bao. You can always do yourself a favor and get the Dim Sum collection which gives you a sample of the dumplings.

The beef noodle soup is also a treat. The one item I had that I wasn't terribly impressed with was the honey walnut shrimp, which came out a bit cold. Either way, looking forward to my next visit already.</review>

Also their ribs had a great kick and fell right off the bone. Our server was very knowledgeable. Everything was priced well and the drinks were also delicious! We will continue to come back!</review>< pictures>

<Text>Good Chinese food. It’s located inside the mall and it’s a bit confusing to find. It’s on the 4th floor. We found our way by going through Bloomingdale’s and then walking into the common mall area. Lots of choices. We had the steamed dumplings. Quite tasty. We also had the boar lettuce wraps / tacos. Tasty as well. I ordered the roasted duck. They did a great job. Normally duck is quite greasy and messy. This duck was hands down one of the best I have had in a Chinese place. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice meal. Pricing was on par for the quality.< /Text><user_id>106622244094338220775< /user_id>< resp>

I'm sorry it's in a mall and not down a picturesque alley in Chinatown, but it's simply better than almost any Chinese place in town. If you like fresh, high end, not too adventurous, but thorough tasty Chinese food. I say this not because the food is better than any number of places I could name, but because the overall experience makes this a civilized, clean experience, with a great bar, big pretty well appointed room, and a solid go-to place. (And p.s., my favorite Chinese place---well one of them is a Szechuan place out Clement Street, and it's absolutely filthy. Same with the other place I could name on Kearny in Chinatown, a gross disgusting mess with a waitress who always has on the same unlaundered seat shirt each time I go. Food is divine at both places, but honestly, I don't want to have to deal with those places most of the time.)</review>

Loved everything about this place from the super friendly family orientated atmosphere to the scrumptious and flavorful cuisine. The female host was SO sweet that she taught my niece mandarin and made sure we were well taken care of. Also this place is very vegetarian friendly. This will now be our go-to Chinese restaurant!< /text>

Some of the best Chinese food I've eaten. Very high quality ingredients and slightly elevated without messing with the major components of the traditional recipes. I could eat here a few days a week and not get bored.< /text>

The chef should be Chinese. He knows our tradition that eat carbs in fall. In addition, this restaurant make great Guangdong dishes. The seasonal special make me feel the rich guangdong style. This is a good example of high end Chinese restaurant. They insist on making traditional Chinese dishes and carefully choose best one that suit for the taste of both Chinese and all other people in US. This is a place not only make Chinese feel like home, but also a window make others to know the how delicious and subtle Chinese dishs can be.<//Text>

I’ve been there twice as it is across the street from my hotel. The positive stuff first. If you are a fan of Peking duck, they do it very well and it’s reasonably priced. One half portion is plenty for two people ($24). I’ve also had the house fried rice which was good but not that special for $13 (a small portion) and any decent Chinese restaurant can do it the same and even better. Now the negative. Two extremely disappointing items were the dumpling sampler ($15 for 6) and the salt and pepper calamari. The dumplings were bland and absolutely tasteless - all 3 flavors were blech. The calamari was like eating a breaded car tire, thick breading and tough/chewy. They were equally wretched ... and I don’t get to use that word often. We were planning to order one of the Market priced lobster dishes, but at $60+ it wasn’t worth the risk when two very simple dishes were disappointments. As this seems to be a mid to higher end priced restaurant, I expected better quality for the price. I will say the wait staff is nice and somewhat attentive, but overall it was a thumbs down for us and I gave it two chances. Venture down Geary St for much better quality, variety AND value. Peking Duck and service makes it 3 stars for me.<//Text>

I love this place. Its located on the 4th floor of Westfield Mall. The best way to get there is to enter on Mission and take the elevators to teh 4th floor. Just walk through Bloomingdale. There is parking across the street at the Fifth and Mission Garage. Location wise its stunning, right under the dome. They have a variety of really fancy dishes that are almost magical.< /text>

As always, I hit up Hunan Homes when I came back to the city. AMAZING! I had to use a fork this time because the chop sticks didn't let me shovel it in my mouth.</review>

I was excited to try M.Y. China as it was a cold and rainy day in the city and I was really looking forward to some excellent Chinese cuisine. That said, I was really disappointed in M.Y. China. I was excited to see that many dishes could be made gluten-free and after learning that the Beef Noodle Soup could not be made gluten-free, the waiter suggested the Venison Chow Mein which I enthusiastically said yes to, having never tasted Venison. Unfortunately when the dish arrived, it came with about 5 pieces of Venison and a large amount of uninspiring noodles and bean sprouts. The Venison was good, but the rest of the dish was lackluster. I will say that the service was good; the house manager came over to make sure I had been greeted and given a menu and I was able to cool my heels there for over an hour without feeling pressured to leave. I just wish the food had been more exciting.<//text>

<Text>Very pleasant experience enjoying drinks and food at the bar. We ordered soup dumplings, fried tofu, lettuce cups, and beef rolls.  All well prepared, served at just the right temperature.  Service was very friendly but a bit sleepy.  This is a safe bet for a decent dining experience.< /Text>< Date>

This restaurant is located in the mall and it's a good option for an upscale meal. I went with my coworkers and we really enjoyed it. We started with some dumplings and liked the pork and crab and the pork and truffle. The knife cut noodles were tasty and had a great chewy consistency. Another favorite was the 5 spice pork ribs. They meat was tender and flavorful and the ribs were lightly fried.</Text>

<Text>Made reservations for 15 for my sister moving away to New York.  My brother had made the reservations in advance several days earlier.  However, when one of our sisters arrived first, the tables were not grouped together, and the wait staff refused to move them together.

As a result, our party was broken into three parts, alienating one group to a round table away from everyone.

Food was okay with small portions with large prices [though the Black Ink Noodle did was the only outstanding dish, but at a high price].  It was a challenge to order more dishes as the waiter, though good, was stretched thin as he was the only one authorized to submit an order.  This took awhile since he did not make regular visits as he had four other tables to cover, and the other support staff were useless as they told us to order through him, which took as long as 20 minutes just to order!

This was even more frustrating since the dining room was half empty.

Probably better to head to Chinatown and get real Chinese food at real prices.< /Text><rate>3<//rate><Resp>None</Resp>< name>

I think that me and my family just found our favorite Chinese restaurant!
Very friendly greeter and server made the experience pleasant.
You can see into the kitchen and watch the cooks working(always a good sign)
The food was really tasty. I have not come across a Chinese restaurant that has a taste that you can savor.
The food is noticeably fresh and high quality unlike many restaurants (Chinese or otherwise).
I always enjoyed watching Martin Yan on TV and think that he has a passion for Chinese food and cooking and you can tell that this pride and friendly demeanor translates into his restaurant. Good Job Martin! I highly recommend this restaurant.< /Text>

Surprisingly good experience here. There can be a wait, so I recommend just reserving through OpenTable since they put priority on those with reservations (they allow same day).

If you are craving legitimate Chinese food after some shopping but are too lazy to make it to the Richmond or Chinatown, just go here!

We got the string beans, Peking duck (half), and beef noodle soup. The beef noodle soup was very good, I actually don't know where else to get this dish since sf is so lacking of authentic Taiwanese food. The Peking duck was great as well, though I wish they provided the thin pancake slices to eat with instead of the steamed buns. The string beans were pretty standard and nothing special.

The service was also really great - despite us having a seat more towards the outdoor area, our waitress Jessica was super attentive.

We are glad to have a good Peking duck option in sf, without having to trek to Berkeley.  I wouldn't mind coming back again.< /review>

Pretty mediocre food. The whole wheat dumplings were good. But nothing to write home about. The crispy Hong Kong style chicken was dry and flavorless. The powdery stuff on the side didn't do much for it. The chili oil helped make it palatable.  $2 for brown rice is pricey<//review>

The food is awesome here. Cooked well and to order with great flavor.

There are a few changes that I would love to see. First, the servers are so busy that you don't really get good customer service, it's almost like fast food service.

Also, When checking out this place, the website said that they teach you about how to prepare the food, but they don't. which is really wack.< /Text>

Good quality, clean Chinese food. The bok choy with cured fish and knife cut noodles with wild boar are delicious. Prices are higher than your average Chinese restaurant, but it's worth the ambience and quality. Good place to take folks to dinner.</text>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>Refined Chinese cuisine. I would never expect a mall restaurant would serve foods this elegant. A surprising and delightful experience that changed my view after my first visit to Martin Yan's M.Y. China. It's not P.F. Chang's. When there is only one, but not thousands of franchise location, you know they will not go midway, since M.Y. China doesn't need to. They serve dishes that heavy with the authenticity but elevated with originality.</Text><response>None</response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

MUST SIT AND WATCH THEM HAND PULL NOODLES!!  The kitchen is certainly a show kitchen. You can see what Chef has recently carved out of Veggies and watch them cook the amazing food!!  The variety of hand pulled noodles are incredible.  They taste amazing as well!  Don't forget the sugar puffs for dessert!  Chef will even walk the restaurant pulling noodles so all can see!</review>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>Essentially a fancier PF Chang’s that’s a bit more on the authentic side.

Pros: nice environment, good service, a big variety of Americanized as well as classic Chinese dishes

Con: very overpriced and the portions were small. Americanized dishes were just fancy Panda Express/P.F. Chang’s, the authentic dishes were ok or worse (some were flavorless, others were dry, etc) and can be found made better in real Chinese restaurants.

Consider going to Fang as an alternative if you haven’t tried it yet< /Review></record>

The whole experience was just awesome.  The location at Westfield Shopping Center is super easy to get to.  We started with whole wheat pot stickers with their spicy sauce was great.  We had Dan Dan Noodles, Wok Seared Beef, Beef Hand Pulled Noodles.  For desert we had the Egg Puffs and Ginger Mousse Chocolate Cake.  This was just a great meal with great service.  Would recommend to everyone.</Review>

China was one of the restaurants I've walked by so many times when walking around Westfield. It never really caught my eye until I ate here. I hear the counter is the best place to sit so you can watch them prepare your food and toss the noodles around, but we usually sit outside the restaurant and watch others walk around the mall. The service is usually on-point and timely. I appreciate their tea selection. The food is also really tasty. It can be a little expensive due to it's location, but I usually find it's worth it. Don't make the mistake like I did, stop in next time you're in Westfield.<//review><date>1460052911624< /date>< rating>

Mu Shu Pork Tacos are the best I’ve ever had. I teared up when eating them because they are out of this world. I could eat them every day of my life for breakie, lunch and dinner and be utterly blown away by every bite. The noodles are a must!! The chef received an award for his noodles recently - they are magnificent. Beijing Knife Cut Noodles are so flavorful with the mushroom combination, a little kick of spice and delicious pork. Bring groups of friends, family or business here for a taste of China that  is unlike anything in San Francisco.</Text>

<Text>The food and service was pleasantly good, I ordered Brasied Tofu garnished with Jalapeño, along with Jasmine Rice, Vegetable Spring Rolls and Spinach noodles soup with 5 types of mushrooms.
The food taste was the closest I have experienced since visiting Mainland China, the quality of the ingredients stood out the most. The Tofu was Crisp and a delight to eat, Spring rolls were extra hot and I loved them as they were not drenched in oil, the soup was a 8 out of 10 just because it was a veggie so it was missing the taste pork would typically add, understandably I had ordered a Vegan Soup!
The price was the real surprise the whole thing was $43.00 which included $11.00 in beverages alone. The service super quick and pleasant, really I’d like to give them 6 Stars. Highly Recommend this place.< /Text>< Pictures>

We visited this restaurant twice in one week.  On a weekday, the service was OK, but absolutely terrible on a Saturday night.  At first, we were told it was a 20 minute wait for a table, after 30 minutes of waiting we were told it would be another 15 minutes!  Then all of a sudden, we were able to be seated straight away. Once we were sat down it took about 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order and another 15 for us to actually get our drinks.  Food is great though and worth the wait.< /Review>

<Text>Not as bad as many other Americanized Chinese food but far from authentic this mall restaurant is a favorite of my 4 year old daughter's.  The spicy dumpling, Peking duck, beef, knife cut noodles and sweet/sour chicken are some of our favorites. The décor is nice and its great for entertaining and families (our kids love running around the mall which we can see from the restaurant).</Text>< pictures>

Gotta start off by saying that we were served by perhaps the best waitress I have ever experienced. She was spot on with timing, suggestions, encouragement, and just the right amount of humor. Type of server I imagine at a much more expensive place that this. Food was really good. We picked out a few items and then our server filled in the blanks to get an awesome family-style meal. Pork tacos and the king pao chicken really stuck out as did the walnut shrimp. Decor wasn't really inviting, but the food and service was so good, I barely noticed.</Review>

M.Y. China is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area.  It specializes in upscale Cantonese (Southern Chinese) cuisine.  The location at the top of the mall manages to feel a little removed from the hubbub below.  Note that it is pricier than most Chinese restaurants.</Text>

Craig Berold, the GM is is a pleasure to work with and he, with Chef Wu, created a perfect banquet menu. Consider this venue for a special occasion or just to drop in if you're in San Francisco.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Date>1499651645133</Date>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
This place is pricey but many of the quality of the food and the ambiance make it worth it for the most part. I went for lunch on a Friday. The shiu mai was delicious, but at $8 overpriced in my opinion. The Hong Kong crispy noodles were came with generous portions of chicken and bok choy. The noodles were crisp and the accompanying sauce was gooey but not overpowering. The wok seared beef had tender and delicious beef chunks, although the sauce was a bit too salty for my liking.</Review>

< review>
One waitress cheated on the tip! My bill was $30.65, the printed tip of 20% on the bill was $10.86 which was actually more than 35%.  I am always generous on tips so I just blindly paid that number.  I just realized this cheating trick after I was back home but I didn't keep my bill.
Double check all the numbers on the bill before you pay it and keep the bill.</review>

<Review>Whole wheat potstickers are not to miss. The wild board dumplings were intriguing but a little bland though fresh. Great attention to design in restaurant. The pear salad was super flavorful. The service was friendly and attentive but they mixed up our orders, forgot a dish, and did the same for the table next to us. That being said, a host came by and served us for a bit and was very gregarious and one of the chefs came out and did a little dough twirling. The food was great and we will definitely be coming back< /Review>< Pictures>

Fantastic setting, quiet place where you can enjoy delicious chinese food. The salad with crispy chicken shall not be missed! Recommended to anyone, those who want to enjoy a meal in peace and those who are in a hurry. The kitchen is visible to anyone and clients can appreciate the way the meals are prepared.< /review>

<Text>The food was the savior for this place. The service was slow. It took the two of us over 25 minutes to just get water and we had to remind the waitress. We also had a green onion allergy and told them before hand and they still put green onions on the food. Pork was a tad chewy but the flavors were on point with all of our dishes. The dan dan noodles are what is pictured and was very flavorful.</Text>< Pics>

Four stars for happy hour.  Good shrimp dumplings (ha gow) and pork dumplings (siu mai) for $5 a dish. Tea house prices but in the evening and with alcohol! Two of my favorite things combined. Calamari and potstickers also  tasty. Would skip the riblets the next time bc they are too hard to eat.

Food pretty good overall but non-happy hour is too expensive (although the nicer atmosphere can be nice sometimes).< /review>

(We later ordered another and it was slightly doughy, but not as bad as most other versions of this dish.) Other hits: Spicy Seafood Dumplings, Black Sesame Ice Cream, Tea Infused Creme Brulee. The Tea Smoked Pork Belly Sliders were merely good.

We also liked the cocktails, including the Monkey Prince and one whose name I can't remember that had Baijiu and vanilla bitters.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Nice ambiance.
Complimentary sparking or still water.
Overly priced dim sum or dishes with veggies that are presented Chinatown style.
Expect to eat small portions but pay $$$ for it.
Overall, you are paying for their rent by having small portion of food.<//Review>< pics>

Wonderfully delicious dinner!  I ate here with a group of about 15 friends last night, sharing many dishes, and was surprised and delighted that I loved *everything*!  Great flavors, texture, meat quality, etc.  And very attentive service!  Our water glasses were refilled frequently, the table was wiped and cleared several times, and so on.

Also, the owner, Martin Yan, came by our table to say hi, sporting a big friendly grin.  You can tell he's truly in love with making people happy with food :).

My only quibble was that the seating was a bit uncomfortable (I was pretty squished up against the guy sitting at the table next to me) and a couple of us kept getting dripped on by a condensed pipe above our heads :\.  But this situation might have been due to us trying to squeeze way too many people into a single long table and likely doesn't reflect the normal seating situation.

I look forward to returning and trying more from the super-tasty and well-executed menu!< /text>

Took about 40 minutes to bring our food, the food was terrible, dry, sticky, and no flavor. Love Chinese food but this was not the best at all. The service is poor. Never coming back plus the food is extremely expensive.</Review>

You can never go wrong with anythinng on this menu.  The truffle Dim Sum is to die for and the chefs come out and put on quite a show with their hand-tossed noodle making.  I highly recommend!< /Text>

My parents have been watching Martin Yan's cooking shows all the time. And in August 2013, when I heard that this restaurant is coming,  I checked on YouTube for info. I can't wait to try the scissor cut noodles!<//Text>

This is a wonderful place to go for fine dim sum dining and fresh, well-prepared noodles.  I'll definitely be back to try beef hand pulled noodles next time.< /Text>< pictures>

IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!

TLDR: of the 2 dishes I ordered, they screwed up 4 times and would have given me a severe allergic reaction!

I went to My China on Wed evening with my CEO and several of his friends. I explained my food allergies of peppers, cayenne, chili powder and anything "spicy" to the waitress and was advised I could eat the fried chicken appetizer, rice and sweet and sour chicken.

The waitress brought the fried chicken wings and it was immediately obvious that it was covered in cayenne or chili powder with peppers on top of it. All of which I am very allergic to. The waitress apologized and promised that she would make sure it didn't happen again.

She brought out the order and promised it was fine as she had personally talked to the head chef and he was extra careful. I almost took a bite when my dining companions told me to stop because it had a ton of straight cayenne on it.

I waited for 5 minutes and went to find a manager, I spoke with another waitress who said she was on break and would come see me shortly and took the wings for a second time.

Our waitress came back apologizing again, and I reiterated my food allergies and that this was serious. She promised to make sure there was no more problems. She delivered the wings shortly after and the 3rd time, no spice, just incredibly over cooked. I assume the chef wasn't happy.

I hadn't received my main dish at this point while the others had been out for awhile. When it came, it was covered in peppers and appeared to have chili flake as well. The table tried it and reported it was spicy. At this point people were finishing up their meals and I was very embarrassed.  The group insisted on waiting until I had my dinner and ended up sitting there for 30 minutes until my food came and I finished it as fast as I could.

This whole experience was very embarrassing and is simply inexcusable.

P.S. The manager never came to talk to me.<//text>

<review>Nothing to complain here. Roast duck is a must. Yang Zhou fried rice too. If you're 21+, try their cocktail, I think it's like Monkey Prince or something.
Their garlic baby bok choy is really good as well.

Those are the menus that I always go for. Their tea is pretty good too, for Jasmine one. Although the milk oolong isn't as great though, it's not "milky" enough. I mentioned this mainly because I have tried a really good milk oolong, so I guess I'm just comparing it with this.

One thing that I'm missing is that I used to make a reservation through OpenTable, and now they are no longer offer it from there. Have to reserve from Yelp instead.< /review>< pics>

Being a S.F. Native, great Chinese food is normal to me. Then there was PF Chang's, call style Chinese ....I worked there for a year, its good. Then I ate at this new spot at a casino near by. OMG  the wild boar noodles and steam dumplings "BEST FOOD EVER"
I am reviewing my parents night out I picked them up after. MAKE IT A MUST  If you are visiting The City . Uber or BART/MUNI is easiest way to restaurant. If you have to drive 5th street garage on Mission and 5th street, safest and easy parking location.< /Text>

<text>Really not bad. Service was pretty decent. While it doesn't taste exactly like how I know it would taste, it comes quite close to the sweet and light cantonese fare I love. Pricing isn't too bad, only thing I don't recommend is the xiaolongbao. It isn't worth it though the flavor is decent. It was a pain to get out of the spoons and wasn't done the way it should be. Make the trip to din tai fung if you can.</text><Time>1522109024720</Time>< resp>

After hearing Martin Yan had opened a restaurant and since I had just moved to SF, it was perfect timing. I loved watching Yan Can Cook as a child and I was excited to have the opportunity to see what his restaurant had to offer.

The wild boar scissor cut noodles are a must try. They are so flavorful and have that nice "wok" flavor to them. It can be a bit salty to some palates but it goes well with the entrees. The Beijing knife cut noodles are also worth trying. They are cooked well and are a nice vegetarian option. The beef hand pulled noodles are also good. The presentation is very neat and the broth is quite tasty. But I would recommend trying the dry noodles to the noodle soups are you can taste more of the "wok" flavor and it's much easier to share. Also, the chefs sometimes put on a show as they pull the noodles right in front of your table.

My favorite entree has to be the five spice pork ribs. Don't let the word ribs deceive you into the dish being messy and hard to eat because it's quite the opposite. The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone. The pork ribs I presume is slow cooked and then fried a bit on the outside to give it that crispy golden color and taste. It's so delicious that you must try for yourself. The lamb chops are also on the top of my list. It's seasoned with cumin and chili powder and tastes so flavorful and juicy. Also, you can give the Peking duck a try. It's not the best Peking duck but it is still good and satisfies the craving.

From the small eats, the tea smoked pork belly sliders are wonderful. They are tender and goes nicely with the bun. But I have to say I've had better as the pork belly wasn't melt in your mouth.

I've made three visits here already and have loved the food and experience here each time. It's situated right under the dome at the Westfield and it's a perfect place to grab dinner and a movie. I love this place and of course I'm planning future visits.< /Text>

<review>We had a good dinner here, but considering the price and general atmosphere something made me expect a little more than good. We had the pork dumplings which were fairly flavorful, but nothing special (and hard to eat). The tempeh sliders had a nice steamed bun and a good sauce, but a piece of romaine lettuce seemed unnecessary and there wasn’t enough sauce. The hand cut noodles with wild boar were very tasty and I liked the noodle texture, definitely a little different. Flavorful, although not particularly unique flavor and it could have been any meat really since it was small pieces. I would have like more mushroom too. The green tea tiramisu was fantastic though, I really liked the texture and there was a strong tea flavor that I really liked. Im not sure I’d go back, but good service and really an overall good meal means it’s worth a stop and certainly you’re likely to have a good meal, just don’t expect something incredibly new or different.</review>< Pics>

<review>It is in the Westfield San Francisco Central Mall. A friend highly recommended the restaurant. The environment is nice and the waiters are so kind. We ordered Da Dao "big knife" fish noodles, Sichuan Green beans, wok(beef, tofu and eggplant). Really delicious. You should have a try.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>Surprisingly good restaurant for a shopping mall. I really like the wild boar scissor cut noodles, the spicy seafood dumplings and the Kung Pao chicken. They make good cocktails as well; I like the Nixon Visit (vodka, allspice, cucumber & agave).< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Non-traditional Chinese food.  Dim sum is okay and costs about double the usual costs of dim sum.  It's more fusion of American and Chinese food.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808580860ca8f4fb:0x170fd44206b9ead1</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>While the service is very friendly and attentive, my pick on dim-sum was terrible.
The ravioli are not subtle at all, the dough is much too thick. The xialongbaos they boast about are a catastrophe; they taste like failed pot-stickers. They do however stick to the spoon they cook them in!<//Review>< Pics>

It's a really nice spot for a mall. Now we have three options at the Westfiled Center for a good meal and ambience. I really like the way the new-asian influence is reflected throughout the decor, with a great open bar, awesome staff and tasty cocktails. Try the MaiTai, it was really well done. We ordered appetizers and they all were super good, perfect setting for happy hour or even a quick meal before going to the movies. Great selection of drinks, food and overall a nice experience. Would come back again.<//Text>

Came here for the Fried chicken. One of the best fried chicken's i've ever had. Fried up crispy and tender juicy chicken inside. It's about the crispyness and the sauce. Tooked up great and the noodles were not too mushy as they sometimes get when overcooked. Waits for a table can be long though<//review>

Surprisingly genuine fare and the service was impossible to complain about. We can recommend the Kung Pao chicken, the wild boar with scissor cut noodles and the non-alcoholic cocktail menu. The prices were a little too steep considering the venue and the food, but that's just a side note. Our visit was still completely satisfying.< /review>

<Text>Yes, it's in the mall but despite that, M.Y. China serves up some pretty tasty Chinese food. They've got the standard kung pao and honey walnut shrimp that are now cornerstones in most American Chinese restaurants but things like their pork dumplings (xiao long bao) and lots of their noodles are definitely on point and delicious. Very extensive menu, nice airy interior. I'd say it's a little bit more upscale too, some of the fish and seafood entrees are pushing $40 but a good meal can definitely be had for less than that.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>At this elegant establishment, Chinese cuisine is elevated to a previously unimaginable level. How? It's Martin Yan's place. 'Nuff said. MUST try: wild boar lettuce cups, whole wheat potstickers, slow cooked beef & hand pulled noodles, pork & black truffle dumplings. Make reservations in advance, or risk getting buried in the throng of people waiting for a seat. This addictive restaurant can get hectic and the wait long. Great for groups or dates, though the noise level can become a hinderance to private conversations. Try to get seated at a booth if you can.</review>< pictures>

I glanced in the kitchen as we were being seated and swore I saw one guy skipping rope while another was snipping a softball with scissors. The things these restaurants do these days to be different.... Turns out this is how they make the noodles. Lots of twirling in the air and snipping noodles from a ball of dough.

We ordered:
crispy springrolls - nothing special here
stir fly baby bok choy - garlic and anchovies brought it alive
honey glazed bbq pork - good but the same thing you'd get in any Chinese place
scissor-cut noodles - I liked the lumpy cut noodles
squid ink snap noodles - my favorite--delicious doughy noodles with scallops and jumbo shrimp mixed in

Plenty of food with one IPA = $67 + tip

With Chinatown a few blocks up, I'm not sure we'll be returning to the mall the next time we have a hankering for some Chinese food. But worth checking out.</text>

<Review>I wasn't impressed. I got kung pao chicken and one of the fried rice dishes with pork and shrimp. The pork was really fatty. The kung pao chicken didn't have much flavor. For the price, disappointing.< /Review>< Time>

Decided to check this place out after watching a Martin Yan episode on TV and heading to SF the following week. While excellent, I have to say the main course was the most disappointing. I started off with the drink of Tsingtao and a shot of a strong Chinese alcohol (like a Chinese sake or something) which I highly enjoyed. We grabbed dumplings and bao for appetizers which were incredible. For the main course I had Milk Oolong Tea and crispy noodles in XO sauce. While tasty, the sauce was overly sweet (I'd say Americanized) and I was hoping for something a little more authentic. Again, it wasn't bad, but I would order something else next time. For dessert I had the Lychee Penna Cotta which was very unique and much less sweet than the main dish. Overall a very good place.< /text>

Its one of the restaurants "Under the Dome". Though it is located in a mall, this place has great ambiance (perfect for date night) and the food here is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! We ordered the crispy tofu, scissor cut noodles with tofu and Kung Pao Tofu! Yes, it is a lot of tofu but we became a fan with the first bit we took of crispy tofu. This was the best tofu my wife and I have had every period. It melts in your mouth yet doesn't break that easily. The crispy tofu was perfectly crisp and nicely spiced. We will be coming here again to try out other dishes, specially the long noodles which are famous here.

Tip: if you like lychee, try the lychee panna cota dessert here, you will regret not trying it!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808580860ca8f4fb:0x170fd44206b9ead1</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Owned by Martin Yan, the menu gives you an incredible selection of dishes celebrating the many flavors of asian cuisine. That sounds very travel-brochure-speak but the experience is one not to miss. They have a soup with short-rib that was a favorite and delicious steamed buns as well. They have a special off menu siu mai that can be ordered off the Westfield mobile app only for a limited time.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I'm not convinced that this establishment lived up to it's hype.

It is also quite expensive. Not so much by the general local prices I suppose, but still, I think it could be better spent.< /Review><user>113890448504292032069< /user>< gmapID>

I don't know how so many people like this place so much! My girlfriend and I came here and while we really enjoyed the Fried Chicken wings, the noodles were subpar. The quality of food does not justify the price, but perhaps the kitchen staff were having an off night<//review>

Speaking of Chinese, the impression is large for a large number of people.
However, I felt that the taste was moderate.
It doesn't mean it's not delicious, but it didn't suit me who was used to Japanese Chinese food.

(Translated by Google) San Francisco's rare high Chinese restaurant. In the mall upstairs, it is very easy to find, the meal is full of people. The decoration is very Nice, the details are very good, and the service is not very warm. The taste of the store is incomparable to that of the domestic ones. Better than domestic is not too oily or too salty. Sichuan cuisine is not very spicy and is suitable for non-authentic Sichuan food lovers. It is recommended Chinese food in Sancha!

(Original)
三藩Downtown 难得的高大上中餐店。在商场楼上，很好找，饭点儿人满为患。装修做的很Nice，细节都很好，服务也非常不热情到位。店内的口味和国内没法儿比，就三藩水平来看属于中上等。比国内好的是不会太油或太咸。川菜类不是很辣适合不正宗的川菜爱好者。在三藩算是推荐中餐了！</text>
