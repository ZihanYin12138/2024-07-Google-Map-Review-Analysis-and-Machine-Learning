<review>Beautiful complex with so many trees! The property has so much open space, which is unheard of for an apartment complex in Sacramento. They recently built a dog park, which my two dogs LOVE (and I'm pretty happy about, too)! Management is very responsive, and regularly updates everyone via a resident app about events happening around the property. They've even managed to have resident events during these trying times: weekly food trucks!
They're going through a lot of construction right now, but the changes that come out of it only help to raise this already amazing complex even higher.< /review>< pictures>

<text>I can not speak highly enough for Ivan in maintenance. Our fridge needed to be replaced, as well as a few beakers from our fuse box. Not only was his service professional and fast, but he was also very knowledgeable sharing information on what the problem was and why it needed to be replaced or fixed. I always felt informed and involved, and he went above and beyond providing easy to understand explanations, and was more than happy to answer any of my questions and concerns. There are a lot of units at this property, and not a day goes by that I don’t see him rushing from job to job.
It’s not easy to find someone with experience. And besides having the right tools, can actually take care of something with such confidence and genuinely care.

The grounds are always maintained and kept clean and neat, and I am glad there are so many trees and places to BBQ

Keep up the good work!

<text>Unfortunately they do nothing about all the theft that goes on around here. Blows my mind why I stayed knowing that my Saturn was stolen and recovered once. My Honda Civic from my uncle stolen never to be recovered and my catalytic converter has been stolen 2 times. I know it’s not their fault but lower the rent it’s not a good place to be at all. So much theft that I am constantly stressing. Finally lease is over and I will be moving.</text><userid>116747045833859366238</userid>< Rate>

<text>Old units with lots of issues and poor maintenance staff. Took almost 8 months to get our HVAC unit operational again. Still having issues with our kitchen sink backing up with nasty water and waste. Very little security as well. Had both cars broken into and property stolen off of our balcony that is about 6-8 feet from ground level. At this point I dont know what to do.

Edit June 2021: found black mold under our sink and have hundreds of flies coming from all drains in the house. Have placed 2 work orders for it and still haven't had anyone come fix the issue. DO NOT CONSIDER THESE APARTMENTS! PLEASE!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< rate>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Not impressed with the new manager Stephanie at all. She also manages Sierra Regency which almost never has a manager in the office and they continually change office hours to hide that there's usually not a manager on site. They started charging a $39 fee for hot water without basing it on apartment size, number of tenants, or whether or not you have a washer and dryer. That means the units without a washer and dryer are paying the same as those that have one which is ridiculous</review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I wouldn't recommend American River Commons anymore. When we moved there in 2013, the management and maintenance staff were excellent, as well as the location. Sadly, in the past few years, the staff has changed many times, and the treatment of the tenants is very disappointing. We recently moved out, and only received half of our security deposit back. We left the place cleaner than when we moved in. They broke California tenants law by not returning our full refund. It's not worth it to live here!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Text>I went to visit a friend and stayed a little late and my car was broken into!! I go and find out by my friend that many cars were broken into! Upon asking my friend if American River Commons will be doing something, they mention the apartment complex will not be taking matters into hands! Where is the security? Management needs to stop sleeping and get things done as it will lose many tenants. They should start a petition or sue America River Commons of failing to keep the area safe!<//Text><resp>None</resp><user_id>111261020162411618955</user_id><GmapID>0x809adaf95e020fa5:0x76bbe7c011361834</GmapID>< Time>

If you have a vehicle and you want to keep it, or not have it broke into continuously, this is not the place for you. Have had vehicle broken into several times and have had vehicle stolen. ARC refuses to put up cameras or invest in secure/gated parking.< /review>

Haven’t had any help. I don’t like how they’ve been treating me as well. Rude and disrespectful. It’s been 98 , 97 , 96 , 90 in my apartment. Plus they come into my apartment with out my permission and I’ve felt so upset. Putting an Ac portable that was not put together.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>I've really liked it here so far and I think it's a fairly good, safe place to live.  The staff and maintenance crew have been very helpful and courteous, and the grounds are always looked after and visually appealing.  It's a very quiet apartment complex and I really appreciate that about any place that I move into.<//review><Time>1491265616955< /Time><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I loved here in the space for two years. The first year things went well and no issues arose. During my second year I experience a litany of things going wrong with my apartment unit including:

1) Our heater going out for over 5 separate nights during winter in which temperatures would get into the 30s. When talking to the maintenance supervisor i learned that the person assigned to work on our unit had incorrectly completed it despite being told what to do by his lead.

2) During our heat-less nights the apartment unit did not have enough heaters to provide to my or my roommate causing us to stay with friends during the month.

3) No compensation or reimbursement for the issue.

4)  During a work order maintenance placing plastic objects into our stove and than not returning them to their correct spots which resulted in ruined pan ware.

5) Long delays in response from the front including times in which the office was closed despite being advertised as open.

and once we moved out, they did not provide our deposit or itemized note for billing more than 31 days after moving out (despite talking to admin staff).</Review>

I will never recommend American River Commons.It is cold in winter and hot in summer though heating and cooling system working. Just wasting the money on energy bill. (huge bill) for a single guy. Lot of drug activities and once almost got mugged in the garage, watch your back. Students are very loud parting late night. Strangers using swimming pool in the day and night. Structure of apartments are not insulated properly, all single pane window. Regardless you clean the place the third party cleaner will scam you and get your deposit. Always you see resident moving out regularly. Management never bother to fix the elevator. Prepare to climb all the way to third floor with your furniture.</review>

<Review>If you like mold, and being ignored about it in hopes that you just go away, then this is the place for you. 25+ units leaking with mold so I am not their priority, and still nothing  being done! Management sounds like it often changes and no one wants to be responsible. Renters BEWARE!< /Review>< userid>

Great family fun at the demolition derby during the Sonoma county fair! We were in the grandstands which I recommend,  the bleachers are on either side (cheaper) and the box seats(most expensive) were closer but could not see the whole arena as well. Nice snack bar with regular snack bar food and also beer.</review>

Saw some monster trucks here, your most likely watching a band, some sort of motorized vehicle or a rodeo here. Bleachers, beers, and food pretty much all you need, bring a hat your in direct sun< /review>

I celebrated my birthday this evening in this gorgeous place. I am glad to say that it was a terrific evening and the venue was surely the reason for this successful evening. The team  collaborated in a sweet style, the cooking was tasty and my guests were extremely  delighted. We shall absolutely return for more events. Thank you very much.<//review>

We are visitors/passerbys from Washington. We were actually looking for Domino's Pizza but found this place in instead.

What a luck!!!!!
We were impressed the minute we stepped inside. Very clean place. Huge and very nice setup. We ordered a medium size pizza...half Veggie and half Special...Hmmm, very delicious pizza. Now have to look for Pizza Factory when we go back home.</review>

Not sure why or how we ended up here other than the kids said they were hungry for pizza. The signs in the window said "hand tossed" and the reviews were pretty high on Yelp (4.5 out of 5) so we decided to give it a try. Not only was there no "hand tossed" of the pizza, the calzone was full of canned ingredients (according to the boy) and our bill came to nearly $100 for lunch for a family of four. Can't understand how this gets such glowing reviews elsewhere.< /review>

Pizza is delicious!! Good service!!
Update 3weeks later... It's 10:30 (not even open yet) and they answered my call to place my order to have it ready by the time they open.... HOW AMAZING!! Had my phone number & info already on file... The girl who took my order was very knowledgeable & helpful placing my pick up order... Definitely earned a 5 star rating from me!! Appreciate the owners response to my original review hoping to earn top 5 star rating!!< /text>

Last week was our first time in this restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We enjoyed the evening very much with the generous service, with the great  food and booze and with the modest pay. We will surely visit there in a short time.<//Review>

<Text>Yikes, I really wanted to love this pizza, especially after reading all the reviews. The restaurant itself is very nice, clean and with a pleasant atmosphere. The employees are very sweet. My one star is for the pizza itself. The crust was so gummy, it was hard to chew, almost seemed re-heated. The seafood pizza was ridiculous, shrimp the size of a pinky fingernail and maybe about a handful with random chunks of crab meat under the cheese. The fiesta pizza had wilted brown lettuce, also, it was 90% jalapeños and tomato. I’m so disappointed! We spent $63 and had such high expectations, it was truly disappointing. Unfortunately we won’t return, such a shame the pizza is incredibly mediocre/bad, it’s beautiful inside.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1579562434693, 'text': "Hi Bren- Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback though I hate to see you didn't love your pizza.

That was our first and last visit last weekend (party of 8)  Food was mediocre (I did not expect many shrimps on my seafood pizza, but more than 7 of the tiny kind. The huge chunks of surimi didn't make it better either)
Ordered bone in Wings, received boneless. Someone wanted no ham, received ham on pizza. Salad was not great and when called on mistakes the reaction was very unprofessionell. Staff needs training in professionalism , customer service and friendliness! Only one lady seemed to like her job. Rather  bring my money elsewhere.<//Text>

This place is large enough to host large parties. Hands down the Best pizza in Gilroy. The garlic cheese bread is a must try, didn’t get the name of it but it comes round like a pizza. The same person owns the one in San Juan Bautista, that pizza factory is awesome too.</review>

< review>
...as with many of those in Gilroy, was waiting for the opening of this Pizza Restaurant. Tried Sampling from the menu...was surprised to find MORE pizzas available that were not on the menu. Pizza has great flavors and meat portions. The All-You-Can Eat salad bar is a great plus, for any Pizza restaurant.
Restaurant was busy on their 2nd weekend ( 7pm Saturday night ) and clean. Only the Spaghetti and Meatballs needed the noodles to be 'al dente' and more flavor to the Meatballs and to the sauce.
The Menu has "Salads and Soups" , but no listings of any Soups...maybe a Minestrone or a 7-Bean ??
Looking to come back to try the Wings.< /review>

These guys are truly the best. I’ve been coming here since 2015. Works with every budget. I recommend them to everyone I know and will continue to do so. I had them do an engine swap with an engine I purchased from JDM San Diego last year. Results are amazing and they helped me pass smog by addressing issues reported from my smog center. If you have any issues, I highly recommend asking for Daniel and/or Jose.</text>

I've had several tire needs lately.  So glad I came here! Excellent and fast service.  Daniel is very polite and professional. Last time I went I had a flat tire. Daniel was quick to ensure I was in driving condition asap since it was the weekend and needed my car for the Monday work commute, thank you!
I feel confident to have this be my go to for any tire needs.< /Text>

Definitely the best and most fair priced mechanics around. Jose is helpful and reasonable with with the prices, and he seems honest not like he's trying to make extra dollars with imaginary problems with your vehicle. Definitely recommend this place.<//Review>

Got me in & out within 20 minutes. I was quoted $54 elsewhere, but got it done here for $60 including rotation. It hasn't solved my issue, but the used tire is up to par & their service is good.< /text>

<review>these guys are something else, absolutely trustworthy. I came into their place w/ a leaking tire, they saw it had a bubble. they said take it back to where I bought it so I can have the place replace the tire. they could have just charged me and replaced the tire themselves. instead, they saved me money and DID THE RIGHT THING !!!!! I recommend them to everyone !!!< /review><UserId.>101799795440689746805< /UserId.><GmapID>0x80d94df723c2069f:0x1ba7846017cbde04<//GmapID><time>1465005775138< /time>< resp>

< review>
Enjoyed visiting this Sports Bar with some local Whittier gangstas , shout-out to Olivia Benedicto who showed us around the pool tables and didn't pressure me and my friend with a drink. She made it a point to grab myself a chilled water and instroduced us to some local names. The only reason for the 4 star rating is we love foosball and they only offered pool as far as bar games go. Will certainly be down to update our rating to 5 stars when we return and have to opportunity to play more games and enjoy the full bar experience. Thank you Slam Dunk for the good night and we promise to be loyal when we can enjoy the back wing with all it's games and space for fun times. Much love. -S3<//review>

Chill, cozy and quaint little bar.  They have one little old TV but I hear TV screens to come.  The outdoor area is nice to sit at, but not fun once the smokers come out.  Otherwise this place has a very comfortable vibe. No pretense here.<//Review>

This was my sisters spot. She loved it here. She brought me here a couple of times and we had a great time playing pool. Having drinks listening to the bands and socializing. I really enjoyed it. My sister Marilyn passed away this month but I will always remember Slam Dunk when I think of her because it was her favorite spot. Thank you for making her feel like family when she was here.< /Text>

Service was helpful and friendly.  We were there to play pool, and the table was not in good repair.  The top played well, but the balls kept getting stuck underneath.  The manager had to keep coming over to help us.  He was good about it, but it was still a bit of a bother.  Parking was ample, but it was a Thursday night.  I don't know about weekend or Karaoke Wed's.< /Text>

I was a designated driver and asked for a cup of water and he refused saying that it would be one dollar. I told him I just wanted tap water and he refused and told me to go drink water at home.

I stop by for a beer on a Sunday night the manager or owner was yelling at hes co-workers with profanity and making jokes pretending to be funny. Also this older woman was drunk sitting by the bar talking on the phone out loud, and the manager shouts across the room, and tells her to take her business outside instead of walking up to the drunken woman and tell her peacefully. This is not the way to treat customers!! Even thou if there drunk. If something would of happen to that drunk woman its the owners responsibility to act with appropriate manner. This manager or has no business or no idea to run a bar. It's a shame!<//text>< pics>

Tried this place out, the only thing good was the drinks.  Except short waitress had a bad attitude. It was kind of dirty with popcorn on the floor.  The guy sitting at the tables was drunk he rolled on the floor and played there for a bit.  I look figuring they would stop serving him. Even the young girl sitting next to me was so waisted she couldn't even talk right.  It was pretty dead about 7 people on Cinco De Mayo at 7pm that's pretty bad. Was ok I guess just for the drinks but not planning on visiting there again.  It's a pretty ghetto bar.< /review>

Very welcoming place to have a drink with some friends as well as sing some songs on kariokue night. The four pool tables were definitely an added bonus but word on the street is, is that there are more bar games in the back eing which is a fun thought.

The group of people coming to watch the band was 40ish+ but good looking. ShoNicely dressed and respectful for a bar crowd. The band sounded very good. Radio hits of classic rock well done. Shock Top were $6.50 on a Saturday night.</Review>

Impressive!!!!  The service was great, the price for the drinks were normal, and the crowd was a great mix. Major point for us girls, is that the bathrooms are clean!!!!!  The band was loud, but awesome (Lickitty Splitt). I especially liked the hospitality of the owners. I will be coming back.<//text>

Slam Dunks is your all around simple, great, sports bar. They have all the games on. Cold, decent priced drinks. Pool tables at your will... and KARAOKE in the back bar area. Come with a group and have fun. But be weary that the crowd can sometimes be a bit rowdy. Steer clear of bumping into strangers or spilling your drink on anyone.< /Text>

If there is any confusion regarding your ticket or the prices of an item, please let one of our staff know. Sometimes when there are a lot of people on a tab the person paying isn't aware of what everyone orders. We always provide an itemized receipt for each customer.  We do however make mistakes from time to time and I want to assure you we are all about making friends, and repeat customers   Please let us know what you ordered, the time and day you were in and in and I will personally look up the transactions in the computer and make it right if we did get your tab mixed up with someone else by mistake.   I am looking forward to resolving this.   Cheers.  -Nathan Nelson, Manager"}</resp>

<Text>Clean store, nice selection at their deli to get ready to eat meat and other entries /main dishes and fresh salads- they have the best macaroni salad in 99 cent single serving cups or larger containers. Good selection to get freshly sliced deli sandwich meats and cheeses. Sales are good, a bit high priced for non- sale groceries. Very nice cashiers and clerks.

My husband and I had Purchased a chicken dinner meal and the food was awful chicken was Soggy fresh out of the fryer and the macaroni and cheese had no flavor just coloring
also purchased some other items like a $6 box of crackers, when I open the box the product was completely smashed all crumbs .
I called to let store know of my visit and my product quality, I told the young lady who answered it was my first time in the store, when I first spoke with the young lady she was very short and kind of rude she kept asking if I had my receipt silly question (and I'm being sarcastic) cuz I told her I had  just been shopping there.. it was almost as though she didn't believe me... rude just plain rude<//review>

Vons is a friendly, family grocery store.  A great selection of reasonably priced meats, vegetables & grocery products is elevated with a tasty fresh deli & bakery.  A Vons card makes everything less expensive while earning the repeat shopper useful rewards.  Each Vons location is stocked to please local shoppers.</text>

I have actually gone out of my way to avoid shopping at this Von's!  When I do have to go there I try to think positive and hope there won't be a line. There's usually only one checkstand open, but occasionally they'll open the not so "Express" Lane, which doesn't always help.  The prices are higher than average in the area and the staff never seem to be happy or customer service oriented.  I used to like this store, but it's gone to the ghetto.</review>

This is a standard Vons: it's often hard to find help unless you go to the front or the deli, the place isn't particularly clean or dirty, sometimes some of the green produce is dead, there are friendly people and some that are short with you, and the lines very from only a few people to backed up into the aisles. At least in my experience, this Vons has short lines and wider aisles than the larger Vons by the Costco, so I come here more than there. It does seem to have a smaller selection of things, but you'll find pretty standard grocery variety.<//Text>

Usually quick to get in and out they don't offer a lot of random items such as a garlic sauce or dinner packages such as hamburger helper, employees are generally alright not overly friendly but never had a problem with them either.</Review>

Too expensive!!!  I paid over $70.00 for 3 bags of groceries.  I think it"s partly due to the convenience of the store too.  I only live about 2 blocks away.  Oh well say la vee!  At least they have a wide variety of expensive groceries to choose from!  😂😂😂< /text>

Good small grocery store. Decent prices but lines can be a 5-10 minute wait every now and then.<//Review>

These guys might take a few seconds longer but they go out of their way with customer service....best liquor prices you'll find anywhere...insanely awesome wine sale ....on holidays they are more festive and inventive than anybody.Steak. is cheaper than anywhere and you can actually talk to a butcher....love these guys....treat yourself to an experience like no other major market....Frank McDermott< /review>

Very helpful employees, sometimes crowded on Sundays after church or lunch hours. Shelves are well stocked. But there's a difference between this location which is smaller than the one in Santee< /Text>

<review>This was the dirtiest Von's/Safeway I've ever been into. There were flies in several sections that were alive but also kinda dead, it was weird. It's cramped and the people that shop here are like zombies. It's definitely a strange store.</review>< time>

< Review>
i really dislike this Vons. however, it is much closer to home than the nice one in santee....so i shop here when i don't have the time or desire to drive farther.
it's small, very run-down, bad layout, poor selection of....anything.
ALWAYS has homeless people, tweakers, and random weirdos just hanging out around the parking lot.
there are much better places to shop in el cajon.
EDIT: drove by the other day, it was all closed up...permanently. Can't say I'm very surprised.</Review>

With the exception of two older blonde ladies I've been treated with blatant disrespect. Today a wider white gentlemen in his 50s from the looks of it rung me up and he barely even acknowledged me.

<text>It's going to be the last time coming here! I waited it on the deli/bakery department, no one helped nicely. Waited it at least 15 minutes for the help. Too pricey as well. Only one person was nice and it was one of the cashier lady. It's a crime to shop here.<//text>< Pictures>

It is a little small and definitely one of the older Vons, but considering there aren't really any other grocery stores around after Albertsons and Vons sold out to Haggens (who then closed all stores), it works. If you go at night, expect a long line, usually only have one or two registers open.<//Review><user_id>113860712590782656427<//user_id></record>

The staff is friendly, gives a small town vibe. I'm usually disappointed by the produce, but there is a decent selection of groceries and the bakery products are good.< /Text>

Horribly overpriced and always super crowded. I always hate myself for shopping here when I'm in a pinch and regret not going the extra mile to Food for Less in Santee where it's clean and cheap! But that's what happens when cashiers unionize... We all eat the cost. No pun intended.< /Text>

It's a Vons. Sometimes there aren't enough cashiers but they have most of everything you need.

Edit: Used to be one of my go to grocery stores. Sad that they closed.<//review>

I rarely come here if i can help it. No matter what time I come here there is always a line at the check stands. They could really benefit  from a couple self checkout stands. There's also always a wait at the deli.</Review>

<text>Nothing too remarkable about this place, just a convenient location as you're entering Willits or departing to Fort Bragg. The gas is usually cheaper across the street at Safeway and the convenience store is superior at Chevron on the opposite corner of that same intersection.</text>< Pics>

<review>The staff is mostly young people but they are very friendly and helpful. I appreciated the level of respect they offer and are very attentive to the customer's need. I was able to find the shoes I wanted and needed. Best thing was no long lines and no long waiting period.</review>< username>

< review>
Really nice name brand shoes. Great dealson the sale items. The Jordan & Nike's  are expensive but the shoes are beautiful.  They do not carry women that wear a size 10 shoes I went to 4 different stores looking for a  size 10 in women  very disappointed  I end up getting a men shoe instead. They do carry smaller shoes for women up to size 9.</review>

<Review>What an awesome experience!!! Went to exchange some shoes that my son purchased at the shoe palace in the galleria mall but this one is closer and they were extremely helpful. Austin was the one helping us, he was super friendly and patient with us.</Review><Time>1529975070695<//Time><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

This is literally the worst shoe palace. They have the absolute worst customer service. They tell lies on Jordan release days for example the Unc obsidian Jordan 1.  I called all week they told me they was doing first come first serve to only find out that they did wristbands not to mention nobody ever said anything about wristbands And I called probably three times the whole week including the day before the drop date release day..</Text>

<Review>I really liked how at the front door a employee was quick to ask what we needed. Also whats great at the store is that they have specials everyday. I had no problems but if I do i'll update my review.<//Review>< response>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>they are not very helpful at all. The 1st time i went in no one offered to help me, so i left. The 2nd time i went in to ask about kid shoelaces. first if they had them for a specific shoe. which he told me they did not. Second to know the size i would have to look for. the shoe is in the store, instead of helping me find out, he jus said he dont know and went about his business.  This store has super poor customer service.< /Text><resp>{'time': 1542048200788, 'text': 'Thanks for your feedback and review.

< Review>
Literally standing here right now and no one has asked if I needed help with something, which I do. One staff just looks at me and continues to walk on by. THE WORST SERVICE EVER! My first and last time shopping here and I advise whoever else wants sneakers please go elsewhere. That's why nobody supports predominantly black and Hispanic communities because of they're lack and/or disregard of customer service. It's literally non existent. If I could give it less than 1 star I would but unfortunately that's not an option.<//Review>

Customer service was great but two weeks later when the shoe fell apart they didn't honor it or  Exchange the shoe didn't want my money back just wanted another shoe because I paid $95 for some Rihanna slides and they should've lasted longer than two weeks</text>

They got what you need in most categories and the items you can't get in most places.   Like olive oil and various other sundries.  They also have quite a good variety of liquor, beer and wine at very affordable prices.<//review>

Had the steak and eggs. The steak was ok. I ordered it medium but it came well done. I don't think it was a quality cut, a little tough. Definitely not worth the $25. I also ordered an ice cappuccino but was told the cappuccino machine was broken. Kinda glad it was because on the way out I saw it and it was literally a machine that dispenses already prepackaged cappuccino. I would of thought they made the espresso fresh. Our server was good an attentive.<//Review>

Also ask for eggs as simple as they can be with a cheap probably farmer johns bacon again not much flavor and nothing special for the price. Also ask for toast on the side which never received and was placed on the bill. Besides the fact that we had to ask for utensils three times before getting them. Coffee I think that am/pm has better coffee, Only reason why I gave two stars was place is clean and a very nice establishment the food really needs to be upgraded. Oh the muffin that my wife had was very good . I would not recommend this place to eat breakfast.<//text><Date>1621201647366< /Date>< Rating>

I have been here twice since the pandemic and although it's a convenient place to have lunch both food quality and service has diminished. Both times food was salty and putting in our order has taken longer than it should have. Not sure why that is, maybe they are not fully staffed. I will continue coming here as it is convenient, however, I'm sure there are better options out there.< /text>

Mimi’s is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a meal. If nothing else is open. Ranks right up there with refrigerated sandwich’s from your local gas station. Good breakfast muffins and clean urinals. Waitresses are constantly above average surprisingly.< /review>

<Review>ZERO STARS!! Horrible service!! We've been wanting to come here for a while and when we finally did we were treated very poorly.  My family and I waited more than ten minutes for a menu. No one came back to ask if we wanted anything to drink or ask if we've been helped. We were completely ignored from the moment we walked in. The restaurant was not busy and when we walked in they were just looking at us, we were just standing  there waiting to be seated. This place made me feel extremely discriminated.  I don't know who runs or owns this place but they're doing a HORRIBLE JOB! After a few minutes of sitting there waiting I started a timer to see how long we were waiting and ten minutes had gone by. We walked out very unhappy and feeling discriminated.  These people are lazy or they only serve people who look pleasing to them.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! WORST RESTAURANT I'VE EVER BEEN 👎👎👎👎👎👎<//Review>< Pics>

Nowadays it's hard on everyone and when someone corrects or makes wrongs right , it showed great customer service. Our waitress was extremely nice and attentive as well as all the  other waiters on shift this afternoon. Kindness , empathy is what the world truly lacks, so I want to say Thank you Freddy , food was very good and great customer service. I will definitely visit again!!!</review></record>

Great atmosphere and food was great. French dips sandwich tasted a little strange but the French toast, scrambled eggs and bacon was great. Some of the best I’ve tasted anywhere. Staff was very nice and polite. Executed their duties as a server quickly and accurately.<//text>

They messed up my ice tea 2 times and once they finally gave me the right ice tea it tasted like African water!! The waiter looks brain dead and the food is straight boof!! Plus after I finished eating I was on the toilet for like 2 hours pooping my onion soup. Even in the onion soup they gave me a fat piece of onion.< /Text>

First timer.. I travel all over North America and I'll have to say the Eggs Benedict at Pat's Cafe are the best I've ever had. Home fries are perfect and what you expect! (Not frozen) with a nice watermelon slice on the side. Great coffee and friendly staff. I'll be back.< /Text>

Not really impressed with this place. Server got one of our orders wrong, fixed but tried to charge us double. The menu said that toast or muffin comes with an omelette, but server insisted it qas extra. Ordered bacon on the side and one of the slices was barely a slice of bacon.

This place must train their people to be cheap and rip off the customer.

I do not recommend this place. Find some place else for breakfast. The service alone isn't worth it for mediocre food at best.< /Text>

I do understand were not in normal times, but getting poached eggs Benedict hard and not runny. Second, hard muffins. They were days old. Went back to exchange them for fresh ones. They were the same. Sorry, but I will never eat there again.< /Text>< pictures>

I really enjoyed this spot. Nice people and good food. We didn't wait at all since we got there before it got busy. Very tight so expect to be a bit uncomfortable. Didn't like the sausage but that's just me. I would definitely come back and explore the menu.< /text>

Can’t believe this place is Still open.  Against my better judgment or just  there being a lack of options open at 9 am we came to mimis it took 27 minutes to take our drink order. Asked for fresh squeezed she said they  definitely had it , she ended up giving me a warm  cup of oj i saw her pour from a bottle< /Text>

New favorite restaurant in town. Everything in the menu were PERFECT. genuine french baguette and butter itself was enough to impress me, but this place takes you straight to France, in some ways feels more France than France. what an amazing gastronomic experience for such virtuous price. we need sixth star for this one.< /Text>

New favorite restaurant in town. Everything in the menu were PERFECT. genuine french baguette and butter itself was enough to impress me, but this place takes you straight to France, in some ways feels more France than France. what an amazing gastronomic experience for such virtuous price. we need sixth star for this one.< /Text>

5 star for the manager(?) being proactive on checking the guests' to improve their services. Food are on the expensive side though. I did get, as well as my companions, got a refills for hot water (my tea), and my companions's coffee and softdrink (soda/pop). On the same location as retail shops for electronics and other stuffs.</text>

The tables were space properly and all rules were followed to the letter. I must congratulate Mimi's chef for the best prepared eggs benedict and corned beef hash that I've ever had anywhere. Eggs benedict brilliantly done. Impeccably prepared with no detail left out. I challenge any chef to come close. As I feel I've eaten my share of eggs benedict every weekend for the last 30 years. I would say I've had my share these are by far the best.. the muffin was crispy at the bottom outer layer, yet very tender and soft center. The egg is perfectly done, the yolk center flowed slightly not hard. The corned beef was served hot with a light crispy layer. The Hollandaise was very light but the flavor was defined as decadent. A small sprinkle of green flavored spice. The meal however slightly suffered because the coffee was lukewarm. However they decided to make a fresh pot which gives them high praise. Please try this dish hopefully something this good, and well prepared cannot be an accident. bon appetit!<//Text><resp>None<//resp><Pics>None<//Pics><name>FRED MENDOZA<//name>< Rating>

First of all I want to say our waitress Keana was great absolutely no problem with her she's a sweetheart and provided great service in spite of the problem with the kitchen.  just a heads up this is probably on par with Denny's except they know what they are and won't serve food that is too complicated for them. expect half the menu to be frozen including the calamari, chicken, fish n chips, and fries.  so the food took forever the fries were cold when they got there. calamari was frozen and Soggy,  the kids chicken tenders were dry, presentation of the plates were subpar, fish and chips was way below average all in all a bad experience definitely not coming back. There's really no reason to the food isn't good, just straight up... the food also took a while saw other customers also asking where their food was.<//Text>

Over the years, the food is gone from excellent to just good. The service is good have the staff tries, but the corporate parent seems to have cut back on little things that have unfortunately made a big difference. There once great Bread Basket which was a variety of carrot bread and baguettes have now just become a simple sliced baguette with some butter. The little extra things that made it special are gone. It is still worth of visit but the enthusiasm of that the place once had seems to have been tamped down considerably.<//review>

Service was excellent and the food was good.  However, the place was almost empty at 8 PM on a Wednesday, and looked pretty run down, like they're just not making enough money to keep the place ship shape.  We remember going to Mimi's for family celebrations a while back, and it used to be nicer.  Soup/salad, two mains and a drink apiece came to $70 with tax and tip.  Parking was easy.< /Text>

It was cold outside, and the heat lamp went out and they didn't have a replacement. The food was mostly good, but they gave you a tiny slice of pie and charged like $8 for it. Should've been $4 tops.< /Text>

We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was still pink in the inside. We also ordered a grilled chicken and mushroom pasta and the chicken was still not cooked right. The waitress took forever to bring us bread. We asked multiple times. She did bring us another sandwich but I gave up on my food. Was expecting better.

<Text>American French style food. Good variety for the family to choose from. The service is good and the food is tasty. They have a fun menu to keep the kids distracted. We went during the week so the place wasn't full.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Went there for Thanksgiving, Waitress was rude. She couldn’t get the orders right, seem like she didn’t wanna be bothered. Will never go there again nor will I recommend it. The food was gross! The turkey Was like one of those TV dinners, salty and processed. The pie was over sweetened with sugar and frozen. Very boring, couldn’t choose anything else. Horrible!! Waste of money!<//Review>< userid>

Good solid wine bar.

The cheese plate is delicious! One of the better ones I've had.

The music is a little too loud for my taste. It made it hard to talk to my boy friends and hear them.</Text>

Can't describe just how good the food is. I've had their spinach and egg breakfast crepes, their omelets, the corned beef brisket hash, and muffins so far. My children have tried things across the menu. It's all been fabulous. Great staff, lovely atmosphere. And the mimosas are HEAVEN. Try them, u won't regret it.<//Review>

This iui s an okay place to go for breakfast and lunch.  The service lacks at times. Especially when busy.  The food is decent, good portion.

Parking can be a problem, as there is only one entrance to the lot and it's in a shopping center that includes Best Buy and Costco.  Always busy.<//Review>

<text>The service was average. On Thanksgiving day they only serve turkey, only one menu, nothing else, which we didn't know, and we were not told at all before waiting to be seated. The meal tasted like a school lunch cafeteria for the price of $19.99 a little pricey. The portions were really small.</text>< pics>

I've been eating at Mimi's for over 20 years (various locations). They have gone through a couple downturns from some menu changes but they have fixed that and their food is as good as it ever was. I had their NY steak (aged 28 days) tonight and it was very tender and tasty!<//text>

Love Mimi’s. Just don’t get to eat there often. Recently, I had a birthday coupon for buy one, get one meal. I didn’t notice the coupon stated we needed to purchase two drinks as well. And the server didn’t bother to tell us that until we were ready to leave. 🤔 We didn’t really want to purchase drinks to go. Server needs better training.</Review>

Mimis Cafe, it is the place where I will keep going for ever, and have been a customer for years.  It doesnt matter what you are in the mood for, they have it.  Great place to hold office events, or just hanging out with friend to catch up.  They keep their season menu very active. I have done thanks giving dinners  with them for many years.  You will not be disapointed on any dish that you decide on,  Service is superb. Place is always clean and their bathrooms very upkeep. Tip for the weekend!  Since is a very good place , allow a  sufficient time for waiting, specially between 10 and 2pm</text>

<Review>Quiant homey old town feels here. Amazed at the decors and art curio scattered and hanged on its walls that had us busy while ordering our food. Satisfied with my order of grilled chicken which was tender as it was juicy. My companion had shrimps smothered in tomato sauce and it was good too. Lots of senior citizens here so be still.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The Service: So-so.... not very attentive. Took the order, served the food.... and gave us the bill.

The Parking: Parking lot right around the restaurant. Since it is located at the end of the plaza so they kind of having their own parking lot. Easy to find parking spot.</Review>

“Cute, quaint, and quick service once seated.”
We've been dying to come here as a family. The decor is so cute--French cafe style. We did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated because this place was packed!!! Thankfully there is lots of seating in the two waiting areas. When we were seated the waitress came quickly and from then on she worked her tail off...< /text>

I came in for breakfast and ordered the turkey, brie and mushroom crepes along with an almond croissant.

The crepes looked very somber hinting at a below average taste and after trying them I, unfortunately, cannot recommend them. But I would definitely try another breakfast entree coming back. The almond croissant was delicious (small with a very delectable and sweet nutty filling).< /text><date>1479925025856</date><Rating>3<//Rating>< pics>

If you go here you have to try the corn soup, one of my favorite sides for dinner and it doubles as a great entrée on lunch! The host was a little bit slow getting me seated but that’s okay because our server was awesome. He clearly knew the menu inside and out and was happy to answer any questions we had and give us his recommendations! Oh, and they have delicious muffins!</review>

I loved this place. It was my first time here and what a difference. I usually go to IHOP or Denny's but let me tell you the difference in food is immediately noticeable. Mimi's food is fresh and hot compare to what you get lately at the other restaurants it seems like they are overwhelmed so you get your food warm or cold. The service at Mimi's is great and the atmosphere is awesome. I highly recommend this place.<//Review>

Our waitress Sandy ignored us and didn't even apologized for not bringing our drinks and complete order when we received our check she said it's ok we can remove that from there... the two stars is for the young man name Jonathan not our server that came to ask if we have been served got our order and was really friendly to us.. we tip him. We celebrate our last dinner to end the year at Mimi's as a tradition and this is the worst thanks to her service...< /text>

Smoked Salmon Benedict was good. Very good service. Roasted potatoes were overdone. Server offered a dessert that we could split which was great..the mud pie. Look for their 20% off coupons on social media. Love their French Onion Soup!</Text>

Food is not very tasty. Service was just ok. This place has declined over the years. It was great years ago but has fallen down over the last few years. I had the croissant breakfast sandwich...bleah. Dry and tasteless.<//review>

If you go here you have to try the corn soup, one of my favorite sides for dinner and it doubles as a great entrée on lunch! The host was a little bit slow getting me seated but that’s okay because our server was awesome. He clearly knew the menu inside and out and was happy to answer any questions we had and give us his recommendations! Oh, and they have delicious muffins!< /text>

Ambience was good. Nice and cozy.

Food was ok. The Calamari was nice and soft. But the BBQ Porkloin was a bit dry.

Service was too slow. But I commend the Manager for being hands-on and helping out with bringing in the food.

I'll still come back, if only for the Calamari.<//review>

First, my salad and meal arrived simultaneously, an arrival which was inconvenient  for me.  The mashed potatoes  were cold; the server, however, was accommodating, bringing me warmed potatoes  immediately.

I ordered meatloaf.  I just couldn't  determine its quality as I ultimately  decided to eat just half of the order.  For the first time--diuring an almost five-year patronage  of Mimis--I was disappointed with my experience.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

We had made a reservation the Monday before hand and had warned them of the size of our group.

Once we were seated the service was good; however, the food was extremely below standards. Everything was cold and the portions were incredibly small.</review></record></dataset><record>

I love Mimi's, but I'm not impressed with this particular location. While I have enjoyed the food at other Mimi's, it seems like the cooks at this location don't know what they're doing. At my visit today, my husband's steak and eggs were not cooked to order (runny undercooked eggs when he asked for over-medium, and rare bloody steak when he asked for med-well). We even sent his dish back and it was still not correct 🙁 My Pork Chop was dry and bland and nothing like I've had at other locations. On the plus side, the waitress was cordial and attentive, and the manager was nice enough to adjust our bill for my husband's meal.<//review>

I came in alone, but I didn't have to wait long even during the lunch rush.    Before I was seated the host asked if the seating was satisfactory, a nice change from showing someone to a table and walking away.  The server was prompt and courteous with just the right amount of friendliness.  (I find it disconcerting to be called "hon" or "mama" by a server.)  She checked back often and the service was the best I've received in a long time.
I came back today and the food and service were just as good.  I don't usually write reviews but this restaurant definitely exceeded expectations and deserves 5 stars.<//review>

A rising star - finally seeing the menu getting a face-lift and much stronger recipes are in the house. The traditional spinach dip has given way to kale-based, the mussels are in what I'd consider almost a chowder base, and the chicken pot pie gained actual flavor.
What was always a challenge here was that the menu was adventurous, but the recipes never quite fit the bill. For example, during the last 10 years of supposed to be French Creole, the jambalaya had literally no heat or spices..  Blackened fish looked black, but had never touched cayenne in the pan.  Very strange menu engineering.
The menu is vastly simplified, keeping the perennial salad and sandwich favorites (almost...) and the bakery is still turning out muffin and bread varieties (but fewer than before, hopefully to lessen non-selling inventory.)
Service has been kicked up a notch, but is still sort of at an in-training level, really. You can tell there's some kind of re-organization going on, and it's probably a good thing if this particular chain will survive another 10 years. Things are changing daily, so sink-or-swim, I hope management stays the course, because there's a gold-mine if they can get the formula on-target here.
The on-table $20 french wines ($5/glass) are undersold, and under marketed (private label imported cellar.)  Probably happening because the staff isn't either comp'd on the sales, nor trained in what to describe about them.  This is a work-in-further-progress at the present.</review>

<Review>The corn cheddar soup at this place is amazing. I recommend this soup along with any other meal that you will order. The place is nice and very cozy. The food is delicious specially the burgers. They have one of the nicest waiters and waitresses. They serve nice brownies also that taste as good as their cheddar soups. This place is a two thumbs up. Highly recommended.< /Review>< Pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>The waitress kept ignoring us to the point she would get one of my family members orders wrong. This is by far the worst experience I have ever had. She served our coffe cold and we asked for a new batch it was ice cold. Even one of my family members sparkling water was just straight gas. THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD.THIS PLACE HAS CHANGED A LOT FROM THE PREVIOUS TIMES I HAVE CAME WITH MY FAMILY. I WARN YOU NOT TO COME TO MIMIS.😡</text>< Pictures>

<text>My second time, wanted to give it a second change, my first dined experience was not impressed with the food. Ordered Egg Benedict, eggs was cooked like hard boiled egg and salmon Does not taste like smoked. Orange juice taste more like pineapple with water added to it.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Really cool diner kind of restaurant. Decent menu, great food, very nice and pleasant employees. Upon leaving, the hostess went to open the door for us. That almost never happens at most other restaurants. Left stuffed and with pleasant feelings.<//text>

Food is good but it took almost at the end of my breakfast to refill my coffee. Even when the waitress finally showed up it took about 15 min to come back.
Manager was so kind to take an expired coupon.< /Review>

< Review>
Very disappointing, poor customer service and poor quality food. Not one thing they served was what I ordered.
I wanted a spinach quiche and instead got one with soggy tomatoes that tasted like it had been defrosted in the microwave ! And the fruit side dish wasn’t that fresh either.
I then exchanged it for a veggie mushroom burger on sourdough - but I got regular bread instead, minus the fries illustrated in the menu.
And the tea I ordered was Earl Grey instead of English Breakfast and also tepid.
This Place has really gone downhill since I was here last month and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.< /Review>

The food was served hot and it was great. I enjoyed all the deserts and food. Our server on the other hand is the reason for a lowered rating. She wasn't pleasant, often felt forgotten and her emotions made it awkward. Her other staff members were on top of everything and made up for it.< /Text>

This restaurant offers solid good food.  I find to be good quality and taste for a chain restaurant.  It also has pleasurable atmosphere.  Service is generally friendly and can be good at times and at other times it is too slow.< /Text>

<text>First of all, I was forced to give one star !
Second time here, I enjoyed it the first time, tonight I paid $16.95 for a burger fries and soda to go and what did I get ?

It was packed in a plastic salad container and not a stryofoam one which I know they have because I got them the last time at Mimi's Cafe leading to the cold soggy mess I opened 15 minutes later at my office, undercooked cold fries, my almost warm medium well burger was well burnt and becoming charcoal, the BBQ sauce tasted like straight vinegar and was soaking through the bun, my ketchup packets we're all stuck together with ketchup and the walk from the front door back to my van shouldn't have been enough time for my watered down diet Coke to go flat except maybe if you add in the fact that the dispenser must be off because it was a cup of soda water without enough syurp.

First time here was dinning in with my Boss Lady, awesome food and impecable service that time, worth the $47 for two and a $10 tip, this time and to go and Mimi's Cafe might want to take a trip to Mc Donald's and ask a 16 year old how its done right for $3.99, because for $16.95 tonight I hate to say it Mimi's Cafe but you sucked, and you sucked really bad, over half of the meal you had the nerve to just toss in a sack and take my hard earned money for went in the trash !

And to think I passed Carl's Jr to come to your place tonight, lesson learned !

Your restaurant was only at about 40% capacity and you guys couldn't get a damn burger and fries right ? Really ?

My check number is 110028, the date was 10/09/2018 at 7:10 pm and my server was Octavio who I tossed a $3 tip on a to go order to and I would gladly appreciate a your response here in this form, so, what do you have to say for yourselves ?

Cause like I said, my hard earned money, and I don't like having to work on an empty stomach.

PS, and now that I've scrolled through YOUR reviews, I'd say it's definitely time for some new and properly trained management and wait staff retraining, because Mimi's Cafe, your obviously sinking fast, and get your damn drains cleaned properly, because your men's room is beginning to smell like raw sewage !

<text>My mom ordered wild rice and got fries, we got our meal way before getting our bread. We had to flag down someone that wasn't our waiter for cream for my coffee that wasn't even placed in front of me, but at an empty seat at our table.  None of these are really a big deal, but when we saved money just to come here to eat, it was very disappointing to experience this level of service.< /text><username>Yvonne Segovia<//username><Time>1515448582712</Time>< Pictures>

<Text>I recently went to Mimi's Cafe in Fountain Valley by Brookhurst and Ellis for my birthday. The service was absolutely great! But I got depressed when I learned that Mimi's changed their wonderful French and carrot bread for bread rolls that seemed to be from schools or nursing homes. It is incredible that a French restaurant made these types of changes and even more Incredible that a French restaurant does not serve crepes anymore. I went there looking forward for my chicken crepes to celebrate my birthday and I found out they don't serve it anymore. That was a trerrible experience. And I'm extremely disappointed in the decisions to replace the original authentic menu to a more americanized "cuisine".  Luckily they at least still have the French Pot Roast.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c0e8737155ab:0x91f27b85190bded3<//gmapID></record>

Service was poor. Dirty dishes continually ignored, even though I had pushed them to edge of the table to be taken away.  At the end of my meal I was surrounded by dirty dishes!  Was given another party's check. Got out as fast as I could after getting the right check. It was a slow night so I have no idea for sloppy service. Was not told about the days specials either.  Menu has very few original items. I miss the apricot chicken and the turkey salad sandwich on raisin bread.< /review>

I have gone here for years and today was the first time that I have been absolutely disgusted by one waiter and the kitchen manager. First off, my brother clearly saw the kitchen manager not wash his hands after using the restroom. After bringing this up to our waiter's concern, he went and told the kitchen manager our complaint and told him who we were. The kitchen manager then came to our table and sat down next to my mom, way to close for comfort and began to argue with my mom on how he did wash his hands. He gave a bs story and my mom repeatedly told him that she was just trying to make sure that her food was being handled with cleanliness. He kept on arguing with my mom in front of my younger siblings in an unprofessional and un discreet manner. The main manager, Tom, was helpful and understood the situation and disagreed with the way his staff members dealt with the situation. Overall I'm disappointed in how the staff dealt with the issue and I can say that I will not be coming here again.</Review>

This place sucks...I should of read the reviews before going.  The food is nasty, service is worst.  Our waiter was very slow and our food took forever to get to our table.  We decided to take our dessert home and asked for the Triple Chocolate Brownie Sundae
Served warm with vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate and caramel sauces.  The waiter came back with a to go box.  When we opened the box it looked like somebody just threw the brownie in the box because the brownie was broken into smaller pieces.  No ice cream and no chocolate fudge. I would never go back there even if the food was FREE!< /text>

Its been here for years and finally got the time to come here. The staff here is very nice and welcoming. The atmosphere feels like a cozy house which I liked. But the food is alright 4/10  but I think it is way to much in price to ask for. I got the chicken parmesan one of the hostess recommended it to me and said its good. It turns it wasnt delicious at all. The chickens seasoning was to overwhelm it was to strong and every bite you would take it would just be a taste of  seasoning than the  chicken breast itself. And it was cold including its pasta that came with it. Overall nice place but I wouldnt come back its disappointing on how expensive there food is here and the lack of cooking experience the chiefs have here.</Review><Name>Kara patino< /Name>< date>

The food is relatively inexpensive and the waitress was very easy going.  I like the chicken chop salad and the pie was tasty.</Review>

<user_name>Darryl Rich<//user_name><review>good casual chain, but not franchaised restaurant that serves comfort food in a new orleans atmosphere.  they are best for their breakfast, which tend to be less greasy than most. breakfast includes huge muffins that make the meal a hit.  the red potatoes are above average for most.  for lunch and dinner the salads reign supreme. even the petite salads can serve two.  the portions are large, but they will willingly split a meal for two people. always expect to wait - no reservations.</review><date>1268006400000</date><gmap_id>0x80c2c0e8737155ab:0x91f27b85190bded3< /gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures><UserId.>114847036622302269873</UserId.></record>

<Review>The food was ok but the server "Lupe" (short, chubby lady w/ glasses) never came back to check on us. Did not even asked if we want water. When I asked her if she forgot about us, she was defensive and said "oh no,no,no!" Manager "mohawk" Richard was not friendly at all. Just walks around pretending to be busy. Very unprofessional. Corporate management, you should seriously check this location, that's if you care.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Wow. Did this place ever take a dive. What was once one of our favorite places for breakfast and lunch has sadly taken a turn for the worse. New ownership has slashed the menu to pretty much nothing and replaced it with, well pretty much nothing. $40 for three on breakfast - Omelette runny, my son couldn't recognize his potatoes, they would not alter the menu for us... boooo! Bright side? My wife seemed to enjoy her $11 burger.
Goobye, Mimi's... Gotta take ya off the list. Ouch, didn't wanna do that.</Text>

We had to wait a long time to be served. The steak was not hot and the salmon was bland. Later on, our waiter told us they had only ONE cook for 3 large groups (2, including us, coming from funeral services at Forest Lawn.) Disappointing, because we go there quite often. Service has declined.< /Text>

This used to be a favorite place for a tasty, well prepared meal either for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The service used to be efficient, and friendly.  After my last few dining experiences, the quality has diminished; slow, unfriendly, inattentive wait-staff promotes an uncaring atmosphere. The creative menu is not supported by preparers who care for detail; cold, colorless, and tasteless food.< /review>

Slow customer services. Took 30 minutes for our meals, they will keep forgetting to give us rest of our orders. $60 for nothing basically.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Never in a restaurant had happened to me that they will take me the bill before the meal! Apparently the waiter had to change his shift and after taking the order he took the bill. My friend was given the wrong food. Very bad service. The food ok.

(Original)
Jamas en un restaurante me habia pasado que me llevarán la cuenta antes de la comida! Al parecer el mesero tenía que cambiar de turno y después de tomarnos la orden nos llevó la cuenta. A mi amiga le llevaron la comida equivocada. Servicio muy malo. La comida ok.<//text>
