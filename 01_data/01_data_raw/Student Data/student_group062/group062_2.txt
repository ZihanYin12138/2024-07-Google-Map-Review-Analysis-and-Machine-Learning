This Robeks is a chill spot. There are a couple of tables and a decent amount of hard chairs. There are usually samples available for customers. In my experience, their customer service is on point. Depending on the direction one is coming from, the store is not simple to access (or see) due to its location. There's not much parking directly in front of the store though a lot of parking within walking distance of the store.

I've come to learn if Robeks (at least this location) has the ingredients to make a recipe that is not (visually) on the menu, they will make it upon request. The Almond Delight is really really tasty. If it's not visible on the menu, ask if the ingredients are available. It's worth learning the recipe to make it myself tasty. Also, registering to be a Robeks member (free) comes with decent perks.< /review>

<Text>I've been to  several Robeks within 30 miles and I've never had slower(lifeless) and worse customer service. The guy (Andy or anthony) didn't say hello or ask what I'd like. Drugg his feet around aimlessly. Took >5 minutes to make a shake I've seen take less than 2. He looked down and ignored my existence. Then when he was ready, just pointed at me to indicate he was ready to take my order. Not coming back. Not to mention, the price for the same shake is at least a dollar more than other locations. (800lb gorilla).</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I ordered the Nutty Açaí Bowl - I meant to take a photo of it before I ate it, but it looked so good and tasted amazing. I was surprised by how big the bowls are for a small. The whole atmosphere was calming and a cute little set up with some tables and stools. I also saw they have these wellness shots so I took a pamphlet to see what they are about.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU21_0NYQ1B3pGbOBoxTwOGhNUDWSf6h8p_j7b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmqhZbaLdwKsn4Des0Qq3_B_zv6uctSAMsqH3z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

A little pineapple juice here, some matcha tea there, it was delicious.  Start off with the small size and work your way up per visit.  You never know how hungry you are, but for sure these smoothies will fill you up!!!!!  No doubt what's so ever.</review>< pictures>

{'time': 1570218189852, 'text': 'Hi Rosemarie, Natural juices separate due to the fact that fruits and vegetables consist of water and nutrients (all the parts which aren’t water). For example, Kale is consists of 84% water. So when these fruits and vegetables are juiced, a lot of that nutrient-dense water comes out too. If left to sit, the water is lighter than the vitamins, minerals and all the goodness, which then sinks to the bottom.\nIf the juice has separated then you can be confident that there are no additives. Most store bought drinks don’t separate because they have chemical stabilizers added to the juice so that it looks perfect in the bottle to the consumer’s eye.  At Robeks, we only use fresh produce so separation is natural!  Hope this answers your feedback.  If you have any further feedback or questions about our juices, please feel free to leave your feedback at http://robeks.com/connect/contact-us.html where we can actually have someone directly get in touch to explain ingredients!

<Review>I love the acai bowls. When I feel like I'm coming down with something this is the best thing to get something good and yummy.  But when I order the staff never seems happy more like I'm bothering them. There are not a lot of places that make acai bowls so I just deal with it.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1548376645703, 'text': "Nancy Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review and we're happy to hear that you enjoy our acai bowls.

<date>1490542949698</date><Text>Tried to use a birthday reward and the cashier told me I could use it on a bowl. Then she said the system wasn't allowing it because it was for a free smoothie. So I picked a smoothie and she said the reward was for any size so I asked for a large. Then she was charging me like $2.50 and I asked why, she said the reward was only worth $4.29... so then I had to pick a small regular smoothie, which is fine cause it was a free reward for my birthday, but it would have saved me so much time had she said that in the first place.... she looked annoyed too.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dd3195a37977a7:0xf21b9321c10e7c02</GmapID></record>

I want sure about this place at first, but I went there had a bowl of frozen yogurt and it was the best I've ever had, my boyfriend had an organic drink with carrots and celery and that was actually real good too. The staff here was pretty friendly. Would highly suggest you try this place.< /text>

<Review>I was sent, without any notification, a Cingular Flip IV 4G phone to replace my existing 3G phone. Took to local store to have the SIMM moved from my existing phone to the new phone. Technician had some difficulty and then gave me the phone back with no discussion after installing the SIMM. None of my data was transferred and I am no longer able to group text.

First line support and ATT advanced tech support was unable to fix the group text issue and then determined  the 3G SIMM from the original phone wouldn't work in the new 4G phone. (I know these Simms are interchangeable, but by this time I'm fed up.) They shipped a "4G" SIMM that the local store refused to install, and had to reissue a SIMM from their store.

SIMM was installed and I have lost all data, contacts, etc. And still can't group text.

Total lack of Customer Service at all levels, unaware of the products they are responsible for servicing, no follow up to ensure the customers needs were met.  I have never been more dissatisfied with the service ATT attempted to provide.

<Review>Isaiah Navarro was so immensely helpful during my experience with getting  my phone replaced by their inept and ridiculously cumbersome insurance company ( asurion)... Isaiah and his two colleagues alexia and raneem held my hand throughout the horrific multitude of road blocks assertion threw at me.  Had it not been for the team at the att store, I never could have navigated the arduous process to get a replacement phone from the idiotic asurion insurance company.  Thank you thank you thank you, these guys are worth their weight in gold.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808e4030e6d8a5cf:0x96522db180d78066<//Gmap_id></record>

I was ready to leave AT&T as I was so upset with the service received on the phone with the account representative once my technician showed up to my appointment to fix the WiFi for my business I was very impressed and with his excellent service and able to repair my Wi-Fi right away. I need the WiFi services to run my business his name is Andy and I would highly recommend him for his repair work he was very helpful he was very friendly and he was on time which is a big thing when you run a business. He was definitely a perfect he is a professional and he did his job perfect he knows his work. I just had to leave this review is there a lot of negative reviews about AT&T but this is an excellent review thank you Andy Nelson! He changed my mind about my Wi-Fi provider but I will stay with AT&T for now thank you again!< /review>

Awesome customer service here!!! Ill save you time... don't even try to go to the 41st location! if you're not buying anything the 41st employees will not help you. At the Santa Cruz location they will go far and beyond your requests to make you make! Specifically, addy helped me transfer my Icloud info after I bought my phone through apple and had some difficulty transferring some information. I love the can do attitude they have at Santa Cruz</review>

<review>This store is happy to sneak whatever they can into any purchase you make. They tried to have me sign a paper that would add a tablet and data plan to my account first telling me it was part of my phone purchase and then telling me I had to accept it to get the stated price for my phone. Both of these were lies.

Do not trust them. You're better off going somewhere else.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had already gotten service at this store before you posted the form( which just asked what request I had). The service at this store was bad, however. I had to come to the store 3 different times just to get an SD card for my new phone. I am a student at UCSC, so I had to take the bus to get to the AT&T store. It took about 2 hours to get to the AT&T roundtrip. If I had known the service would be so terrible( and on top of that, the time I wasted for transportation), I would have just ordered the SD card online and gotten it faster (and  probably for cheaper too).
The first time I arrived at the store the staff was busy, so I stood waiting for about 5-10 minutes, before they told me to sign in. By then, a couple of other people had arrived after me. And they managed to get the sign in sheet before I did. So I had to wait for at least  half an hour longer than I should have.  And the staff didn't even care. I waited for about one and a half hours before a staff member assisted me. When I finally got assistance, they told me they were out of the type of SD card that I needed. And that a new delivery of SD cards would arrive in 3 days. I came 3 days later and the SD card still hadn't arrived. So now I wasted even more time on the bus and in line at the AT&T store.
I finally came a third time after my friend convinced me to go, and  she offered to drop me off there. I showed up and got my SD card. But they kicked me out because they were closing the store, even though there was about 10 minutes before the store closed. It would have only taken 5 minutes for the store to activate the SD card.  I couldn't even activate my SD card until later. I had no cell phone service (since my new phone didn't have the SD card and my old phone was broken), so I had to ask my friend for her phone to activate the SD card.
I've been to other AT&T stores and the service there is far better than the service at this AT&T store. First of all, the wait time at this store was ridiculous. Somehow other stores have a wait time of about 10-15 minutes even at busy hours, while this store has a wait time of over an hour.  Also, kicking out a customer (when the customer still has a question or quick service they need) is terrible customer service. I will never come back to this store, for as long as I can avoid it. There is absolutely no  decent customer service or professionalism here.  But at least now I know which AT&T stores I will be going to from now on(eg. 8225 Mira Mesa Blvd, San Diego, CA 92126).< /review>< pics>

< review>
After being an AT&T customer for nearly 20 years I received horrible service at this (River Street) location. When I went into the store to purchase an international plan, initially they were quite nice. However, when I received my bill, and saw that they had drastically overcharged me (way beyond what I had agreed to) their attitude became quite different.
After looking at my bill, the salesperson agreed that it had been their “mistake.” However she claimed not to have the ability to take the charges off. So, naturally I (politely) asked to speak with the store manager. As it turned out, he happened to be the same person who messed up my policy in the first place, by charging me three times what I had agreed to. Then, the manager (ALEX) was absolutely horrible to me.
I have worked in customer service, and even in management, and I have never encountered a situation as appalling the interaction was with this individual. Nor would I ever dream of treating a customer so badly.
Alex’s attitude was atrocious! He rolled his eyes, didn’t even glance at my bill, and rudely refused to help me. He told me that if I wanted his help, I would have to come back 5 days later. Meanwhile, my bill was due. I couldn’t wait.
Then shrugged his shoulders, turned his back on me, and began to walk out of the store. I was shocked. He grabbed his things and started to walk out saying that he wouldn’t help me (not “couldn’t” but “wouldn’t”). So, then I politely asked for the name of his regional manager, since Alex wasn’t any help.
Alex snickered, rolled his eyes again and flat out said “No.” He spoke in an incredibly condescending tone, and talked down to me- I asked again, ore sternly this time. He gave me a nasty look and repeated that No, I could not have the name of his district manager. This was by far the very worst customer experience I have ever seen. Also, at the time there were 7 other customers in the store, and 3 other employees, all of these people witnessed his horrible behavior.
Meanwhile, since then I have spent multiple hours on the phone with AT&T, trying to reverse Alex’s “mistake.” But, so far the charges are STILL on my bill.
Because of Alex this location has lost the business of myself, many of my friends and family, and hopefully YOU too dear reader. I sincerely hope that you will head my warning and stay away too. Lesson learned, make the trip down to the corporate store in Capitola!!< /review>

<review>Not at all what I was looking for in an AT&T experience. Went in to upgrade my phone, and as all of the three associates were busy, decided to wait quietly in the back until someone freed up. It took a solid ten minutes before anyone even acknowledged I was there, and this acknowledgement was rudely shouted across the store to the point where every customer and associate was then staring at me as I then had to shout my business back. Incredibly unprofessional. I immediately left and will take my business elsewhere.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Slow and unhelpful
Employee was scolding customers for not signing in when there was no pen available. Wasted an hour waiting when they didn't have a clue how to resolve my very basic issue. Their solution was to get a new phone and why not because I'm due for an upgrade right? Oh, but I'm going to have to call AT&T and jump through some hoops first... later<//Review>

great phone place great phones love it
i really think people should take at&t as their
new phone place
it is a little on the pricy side and that is one of the
things not so great about it. but aside from that it is really
good works all the time and most of the people with at&t
love it like i do.
i think it is a one four in a half because of the price but the
place itself is really great.</text>

The staff (especially Amber) was kind, friendly and stuck with me throughout the service. They weren't pushy and were extremely helpful and insightful.</Review>

Bought my phone and plan here originally.

Went to buy iPhone case was ignored by staff, left and bought it at Office Max.

Dear Staff, I'm sorry you're job sucks but the workers at Office Max probably are in a similar situation except they were nice and very helpful so you really have no excuse.<//Text>

the worst service I have ever encountered.  Every time I have gone here I have waited 2 hours.  Was lied to about my contract when I signed up and will never go back to this store, they gave me a used Note and tried to pawn it off as brand new....may in fact switch service providers as they make ATT look awful.  Go to another ATT provider.</text>

<Review>Went there today to switch phones, had an issue, and tried calling them once I got home. They said they were busy and they'd get back to me. They never got back to me.

I am a little miffed. I'm sure they are busy and have their reasons, but honestly, I need my phone to work, and the people here are blowing me off...</Review>< Pictures>

The store has no plan for volumes of customers. There are no lines for service just people standing around. Customers actually fight over who is next. It's anarchy.< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I had an incredible experience at Temecula Auto Care. Scott is very caring and knowledgeable. I dropped my car off right before 10am and it was finished just a little after noon. So fast and so professional! I appreciate that the people at Accurate Auto Care perform a full inspection and update you on the car's maintenance needs in a hassle-free way. There was no obligation to add on additional services or fixes, and I got to choose what I wanted them to work on for today. I was able to get an oil change, inspection, new battery, cabin & air filters, back brakes, and fluids for an INCREDIBLE price. I am very satisfied and I will be returning in the future for my car service needs. Thank you again!!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I have to give the biggest shout out to Chris @Temecula Accurate Auto! Scott did an amazing job getting me in right away,  fixing and finding issues in my 2004 baby and making her all good again!! I cannot thank him enough for his excellent service, caring attitude and willingness to explain and go the extra mile to ensure I had great service. There is a reason I have been coming back for years and will continue to do so. :)
You guys are the best and I cannot thank Chris enough for his honesty and time today!!  A+ service!!!< /Text>

Knowledgeable,  Efficient and Transparent in the way they do business.
Have had the brakes in for routine maintenance twice in two years due to normal wear..  Service was completed in a professional and timely manner, while all of my questions and concerns were acknowledged and addressed beyond that of typical shops I have worked with in the past.< /Review>

First visit and will definitely be back! Scott was so awesome to work with and explaining what repairs need to be done on our older 2001 car. His customer service was more then I ever expected and kept me up to date as they worked on our car. The price was extremely reasonable, but for reliability and the honesty it is truly priceless!</review>

<Review>After Temecula auto repair & radiator closed and sold their building to Tesla it took me six months to make the decision to find another shop. Based on their reviews I decided to try Scott out. What a pleasure it has been to deal with this shop. I don't know exactly what things should cost but I know enough to know when I'm being ripped off. Scott charges a fair price and sticks to his quote, the same way I run my business. I like that, I hate surprises.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1615051316349, 'text': 'Happy to help Jon!

I was a mess with broken down car being towed into his shop. Scott quickly calmed me down arranged the best rental with his amazing discount and I do mean discount best rental ever 🤗 then he quoted one price but since he didn’t have to do all the steps this honest man lowered my bill ! That’s never happened to me 🤗 my car is running perfect and I’m not taking my car anywhere but here for the rest of my little cars life 😝 I cannot recommend this guy enough ! If you want honest , Clean ( very covid friendly ) very knowledgeable and great service! This is my recommendation Scott is the best .<//Review>< pictures>

I’ve had an issue with my 2000 4Runner forever that no one was able to fix and finally after my mobile mechanic gave up and ghosted me, Scott and his crew were able to properly diagnose the issue and fix it right away! It hasn’t run this good in years! I can’t recommend Temecula Accurate Auto Care enough. Either go there or get sub par work elsewhere.

I have always taken all my vehicles to Temecula Accurate Auto Care for diagnosis and repair.  I have complete trust and confidence in Scott and Chris, they have always effectively addressed my auto issues and are timely (quick turnaround) in repairs and fair and reasonable regarding repair estimates and actual costs.   They are AAA approved for auto care which is a big plus.< /Text>

When looking for honesty and integrity,  and fair pricing,  Temecula Accurate Auto should be the place you take your vehicles to. Ive been going here for years along with my kids as well. More mechanics need to follow their way of business!<//Review>

<Text>Thanks so much to Chris for helping me with my Civic. I took it in when he was already busy with other vehicles and he did some quick checks to give me an idea of what I was looking at. He kept in touch with updates while he had the car because he knew I was in a time crunch to get it back. Solved the problem without a lot of fuss and I’ve had no issues since.

<text>Professional and honest. Support this family-owned business in Temecula. If you are looking for an auto repair shop look no further. They can tackle the small and large size mechanical issues as well as maintenance.  Don't pay dealership prices with robotic noncaring staff. A+ A+ A+!<//text>< user>

Impeccable attention to detail. Their professionalism, honesty, and prices are over the top. Scott and Chris have been working on my cars for over five years now. As long as I'm living in Temecula, Temecula Accurate Auto Care will be working on my car. Thank you so much Scott and Chris!</review>

I took my audi there a few months ago for a suspension maintenance repair, and he quoted me about half the price that audi did.

I had the pleasure of having Scott work on my car. From the very beginning he was very kind, professional, and ready to put in any work necessary to help me out.

He offered amazing customer service and went above and beyond what anyone could rightfully expect him to do. I was extremely pleased with his work ethic and the quick manner by which he handled things.

If you need any work done wether a quick oil change or something like your transmission or engine, Scott is definitely your go to guy.

Thank you so much!</text>

Originally went in because I had a dead rat in my car and no place could squeeze me in 20 min til 5:00 and Scott got me in even tho he was busy, and he got the rat out super quick and then took care of all the problems the rat did to my car. Super awesome guy! So thankful! I would have had To have a dead Rat in my car over a 3 day holiday weekend.. but he saved the day for me</Review>

<review>They said the work was so minor they did it for free.  AND they told me I should check with the dealer before doing a different repair because of a possible factory recall.  When I asked questions they answered them.  Good work, no double talk, no exploitation.  Really pleasant experience.

This Auto Repair Shop basically hidden in Temecula offers the most honest and reasonable auto repairs within at least a 50 mile radius. Chris and Scott are two brothers who own and operate this Oasis of Auto Repair.

They are honest and reliable. Price quotes for services are a fraction of the quotes you get by taking your vehicle to the dealership.

If you are having a problem with your vehicle go to Temecula Accurate Auto Care first!! Your won't be sorry.< /Review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>Going with a tentative rating for now. They seemed to know their stuff. They were straightforward. They didn't fix what didn't need fixing and fixed what did. Prices seemed a little high for some things. They put on new belts and now the belts squeak when taking off from a stop. In all, not bad but not great. I will probably look around at other places, but I wouldn't feel bad about having them work on my car either. Update: after posting this review, that called me about the squeaky belt and had me come in to adjust it for free. I will give then another star for that.</text><user_id>112761404444063644573<//user_id>< Name>

We had a rental from another state that started leaking a brown fluid. We thought it was transmission fluid. These guys took our car back, lifted it up, was under it with flashlights, and let us know it was just dirty AC water. They could have price gouged us because we THOUGHT it was transmission fluid and clearly didn't know any better. So grateful for this business. Saved our honeymoon!</review>

I needed to service my air conditioner and Temecula Accurate Auto Care was recommended to me. And I see why. The Customer service was above and beyond; after inspecting my a/c they made clear what my options were before going ahead with any work. After having a clear understanding of my options they went ahead and made my repairs for the reasonable price that was quoted. I put a lot of trust into them and they gave me the respect a customer deserves. A+</Review>

Got my honda odyssey timing belt and serpentine belt replaced at Temecula Accurate Auto care. I ask Scott to quote me the Honda parts and the quote was about 750 to 800, after job done I double check his work, so disappointed, the parts he installed was after market, the coolant reservoir was totally empty power steering fluid spills on the side of the engine. I went there because of the good reviews but I was wrong!<//Text>

I also informed you that we can give you a 3 year warranty using our parts, instead of Honda's 1 year warranty, which you liked.\nYou approved the $798.00 knowing we were using aftermarket parts, so you could save money.  As far as the coolant being empty and power steering fluid being spilled, I will give you the benefit of the doubt, but, an ASE certified Master Tech that has been fixing cars for over 20 years who has a knack for keeping cars clean, and full of fluids performed the work on your Odyssey.  I highly doubt he let the car leave the shop in that condition. - I'm sorry for any misunderstanding that occurred, and will do what I can to remedy your concerns."}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Brought my car in to get a new catalytic converter since I didn't pass smog. Normally when I take my car into any shop, I have to prepare to be either lectured on what's wrong with my car, or told I need to spend hundreds more to fix more issues that I know I have but can't fix all at once. Not a word from Scott, because as he said "you want to replace the catalytic converter, that's all I'm here to do today". And he did exactly that. Passed the smog retest today, so he's clearly using quality parts. Price was more than fair, was done same day. If I can't fix something on my car, with or without help, I'll gladly bring my car back with the knowledge that I'm going to have the work done right. Thank you!<//Review>

Chris and Scott are great. They do outstanding automotive work at competitive rates.  Several weeks ago, I took my Jeep Liberty in, DCH Auto Group quoted me about $6000 worth of repairs. Chris looked at the car and identified that half the DCH "recommended services" were completely unnecessary and the rest could be done at about half the cost. These guys take the time to explain everything - very friendly. Nice location - their waiting room is comfortable and well stocked with Keurig coffee. I trust these guys and will gladly refer my friends to these gentlemen.< /review>

Lots of typical hardware stuff, decent prices, super helpful staff that helped me locate a bunch of different size nuts and bolts. When some didn't work out they were real cool about my returns. Best of all, parking is really easy. I'll definitely go back.</review>

Great store where you can find pretty much everything.  Staff is very knowledgeable and is a huge help. Terek(might spell the name wrong) helped me with the process of remodeling and what I would need for it while staying on the budget. Definitely would recommend!<//Review>

This is an outstanding local store. I came in with a broken key and the staff went out of their way to cut a new key for me so that I didn’t have to replace my lock. I’m also amazed with how much selection is available in this store. They are the only store in the area that carries replacement parts for my toilet, including the big box stores.</text>

< Review>

Went today to have something mala with one other person.  We ordered the cucumber salad, intestine dry pot, Kangxi noodles (grandmas spicy noodles?), and rice.

Their portions are huge, and the prices are very fair for what you get.  The Kangxi noodles were numbing spicy, with salty bits of pork and savory peanuts. The intestine dry pot had soft tender potatoes, chewy and sometimes soft intestines (wished there was more tender pieces, but some parts of the intestines are just chewier) , and cauliflower carrying a lot of the flavors from the sauce.  The cucumber salad was cool and refreshing, and great to have in between bites.

We couldn’t finish any of the dishes in one sitting, the leftovers are going to last for at least another day’s worth of meals. Will definitely come back to try other things on the menu, I’m a fan.

________________________________
Some of the lowest scoring reviews are a little crazy:
the food is going to have lots of oil that is spicy, it wouldn’t be authentic otherwise.
I don’t understand why I would care about masks being held up by double sided tape if the food from the kitchen was some of the best offered in the area.
If someone’s going to ban you from their restaurant, it’s probably just not because you called their cake dry.

UTA is United Taiwanese Association.  It’s maybe a club from UCSD?< /text>

We decided to try this Chinese restaurant for the first time. I guess that it had a different restaurant name before a change of ownership
We had a nice experience here and the food was nicely prepared. The service was nice and our server, although a little quiet, was still friendly, helpful, and informative about the menu. The restaurant is spacious and has a nice decor.

We decided to order four dishes. The dry fried string beans were great and had a great flavor. We have had the same dish in other restaurants but this one was really good. The second dish we ordered was a spicy squid with peppers. It was delicious and did not have a fishy smell. Our main dish my partner and I ordered soup dishes. I will say the portion if soup you get is quite large and very filling. I ordered the Beef Noodles Soup. The broth was great and had lots of noodles and beef. The beef itself was tender. My partner had the Kangxi Spicy Noodle. It was great and yes quite spicy.

Overall we had a nice experience and would return to try some dishes from Northern China. Our service was nice and so was the food.< /review>

I don't really like spicy food, but the food here was amazing! Especially the spicy cauliflower! It helps to come here with many people to eat family style so you can slow down the spiciness with non-spicy food.

If you have a big enough party you can get a private room, and it's very nice for big groups! I'd love to come back again with my friends!< /review>

Good food, tasty dishes. The menu is a combo of Dongbei (Northeastern China) food, Sichuan, and Hunan food. The latter two offer spicy dishes, Dongbei food is not spicy, with more meaty and hearty dishes.

Friendly services, fast and attentive. A good Chinese food selection on Convoy.< /Review>

came here with friends on a Sunday night. This place serves very authentic Chinese/Szechuan cuisine. On top of their delicious spicy food  there's also a variety of non-spicy dishes to choose from. The price is super reasonable given the huge portion, plus the restaurant is pretty spacious so it seems like a good hang-out spot for large groups. Had a great time and enjoyed the food here. Will come back again!<//Text>

The restaurant is big and clean. The dishes are really good and authentic. Recommend the fish fillet in chili broth and crispy fried pork, good to  match several bowls of rice. The only thing to be aware is that their dishes are a little bit greasy and spicy, may induce diarrhea.< /text>

<Text>OK experience. Food is not bad. However there is a lack of overall effort in the restaurant quality. The place is kinda dirty; floors are very sticky and plates mismatching. The decorative masks on the wall were simply taped to the wall with clear tape.<//Text>< pics>

<user_name>Liyan L< /user_name><Review>This is an honest, true to earth Chinese restaurant. Since its opening in San Diego, it has become my absolute favorite place to go and bring friends. The flavors are truly authentic, as the place is apparently family owned by a couple from Szechuan, and they do their own cooking. This isn't your average "chinese takeout"-ingredients are super fresh, portions are huge, and everything is cooked to the perfect level. Food is very flavorful, and they even serve a variety of beer and wine. Staff and owners are extremely friendly, and its definitely a place to try out! You won't regret it!< /Review>< Pics>

This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurant in San Diego. I went there with UTA (the taiwanese org) in the very first time, and in love with it. They served Sichuan cuisine which is known for their spiciness. and all their dishes we ordered were on point. We ordered Spicy grilled whole fish and sliced pork with green pepper which are both their signatures. you could tell that the fish is fresh, the pork is not overcooked, even their sauce is perfect. all their dishes were all in quite big portion, so it's good that we can take away some of it and save the money for the next meal! The place is quite big, clean and the service was good and very attentive. This is defitnitely my go-to Asian restaurant. I recommend to all of you.<//text>

Excellent Hunan cuisine and great service! Hunan food has the reputation for being extremely spicy which puts a lot of people off. However, there are definitely milder more accessible dishes available in this cuisine for those like me who can't take extreme heat. On my visit yesterday I had three dishes. The first was the northern crispy pork, crispy fried slices of pork with a crisp batter and glazed with a tangy sweet and sour sauce. Very tasty! Next a stir fry of tender beef with white and green onions, very well prepared. The high point was the braised whole fish served in a nicely seasoned sauce and topped with tofu, baby bok choy, and cilantro. This was absolutely delicious!

The staff is very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this place! I'll definitely be back soon.<//review>

I went to Kangxi Is Coming as part of UTA's thanksgiving dinner last week. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for good Chinese food. They have both spicy and nonspicy food, so it can accommodate for all kinds of preference in Chinese food.< /Review>

I haven't eaten such awkward pork loin. The soy-flavored potato silk is only salty and fungus (although there are only seven fungus)....
Forget it...
In sd, I shouldn’t expect any delicious Chinese food....

那些给五星好评的人是故意的吗……
没吃过这么腥的猪腰姜味那么重的土豆丝只有咸味的什么木耳（尽管里面只有七片木耳）....

I was a customer here for years, and had referred friends to the office. Stamper made an insurance billing error and tried to bill me for their mistake. If you get insurance authorizations from them, make sure to get it in writing, so you don't run into the same frustration I did!

I'm out the free $180 for the year from my 2019 insurance, because Stamper staff "didn't think it was a big deal". It's incredibly frustrating because I had confirmed with Stamper staff, and both 2019 and 2020 insurance companies, that I was able to take advantage of the contact stipend from both insurances.

TLDR: Steer clear and take your business elsewhere!</review>

<review>Overall I've had the best experience so far in town for prescription glasses. Selection of frames is good, larger than in many other fancier shops; sales assistants are competent, professional, and patient; visits with the optometrists satisfactory and accurate, with detailed and careful explanations; front desk service is corteous and attentive, albeit not the fastest at times because of the high volume of clients. They are also very good at reminding of your appointment. The only reason I'm not giving the full 5 stars is that glasses bought at this, as at any other independent eyeware shop, are always overpriced compared with the "real" value you might get online or at big vix stores. Therefore, 4 stars is as far as you can go with this kind of retail business.</review>< GmapID>

Honestly wanted to like this place but I haven't had good experiences with them. Long waits, the glasses seemed overpriced, and they ordered the wrong contact lenses for me. I didn't notice till I got home and opened them, so now have to buy another 3 months of contact lenses.</review>

Stay away from this terrible, horrible place! Their staff is rude, ghetto and dismissive, unless you buy expensive glasses. They promised a 2-week turnaround for lenses replacement and it has been a month and they're still not ready. They jack up the prices of eyeglasses and sunglasses so high they are so ridiculous! These people are greedy monsters! Let me repeat, stay away from Stamper Optometry!<//text>

The staff at Stamper are knowledgable and incredibly friendly. The Optometrist who examined my daughter (14 years old) was good with her and me, and was able to get the right prescription for her unusual vision. She found the glasses she wanted quickly, too. Great selection. Take the bus because parking isn't easy in the Mission...but Stamper is well worth it!<//Text>

I have been getting my eye exams with Dr. Stamper's office for many years and have received the most comprehensive eye exam using the latest equipment.  The optometrists have a caring attitude and are experienced, competent professionals.  I feel I'm in good hands when I get my eyes examined at this office because I know they will be thorough.  Dr. Stamper discovered that I had cataracts in my left eye and gave me an excellent referral to a doctor who performed the surgery with excellent results.  Thank you to all the staff who are courteous, patient, and very helpful in every way!< /text>

Getting glasses has always been a stressful time for me but when I came in for new prescriptions, I was at ease from the friendly staff despite there being a lot of customers. Everyone was very helpful in explaining my insurance options and suggesting frames that fit my style and budget! There's lots of frame options and brands carried at this store. They're also quick to help with any glasses fitting issues!</text>

It was time for an eye exam and since my usual place had gone out of business I was searching for a good, reputable place, preferably in Stamper Optometry that wasn't going to charge me an arm and a leg for an exam.My co-workers immediately told me about Stamper Optometry and how pleased they were with their overall experience.Sometimes word of mouth referrals can be a toss up, but I have got to say that my experience here was a great one! I've received professionalism form the staff from the follow up phone call that I received until the minute I left.The Dr. was very nice, explained to me all the questions and concerns that I had regarding my eyes and I felt very comfortable throughout the entire process. Definitely a wonderful place, I can see why my co-workers praised Stamper Optometry so much and I plan on definitely doing the same thing.</review>

< review>
Dr. Hansen was fantastic, and really listened to my work lifestyle to help me decide on glasses to help with my far distance, but also a set of glasses that help reduce the strain on my eyes for long computer work for everyday. However, I had the worst experience with the newer staff member Jessica. At first, things seemed fine and she was helpful in deciding the frames. However, when they arrived, the order was completely wrong. Somehow, the blue light filter, which is only used for reducing blue light from electronics, was put on my distance lenses and in the wrong, cheap frame (since I was not wearing distance glasses every day, I chose a cheaper frame). When I told her this didn't make sense, the blue light would obviously be for close-up glasses for the computer, she proceeded to tell me for 30 minutes how she only writes down what the customer wants, and it was most definitely my fault and NOT her fault at all. Not to mention she didn't mention (or likely even notice) my two frames were two different sizes, and was obviously large on my face. That too was apparently my fault because I picked them out because I liked the design. This is my first set of glasses, so how am I supposed to know how they fit?! Isn't that her job? She NEVER admitted any fault, and told me it was my fault every chance she got. She was very rude and clearly upset at me for the mistake, but never got a manager involved to make sure I was satisfied with how to proceed, and just told me she would send them back (and wouldn't even rush the order. took 2 weeks to get them back). To top it off, they made me pay the $5 difference for clearly their mistake. Someone should have caught that error to begin with if they knew what they were doing (blue light always means electronics and NO ONE is looking at electronics at a long distance). Horrible experience and will never be back. It was a shame too because the doctor, and the staff that helped me afterward (Paul and Jose), were fantastic. If Jessica wasn't sure about the order, she could have asked my freaking DOCTOR, who prescribed the lens and filter, to easily clarify for her.</review>

I never imagined that the first Google review I ever wrote would be for an Optometry office, but I had such a wonderful experience, I had to post! The office was very clean, the staff were friendly, and my contacts were estimated to take a week to arrive, but they arrived in a single day! My optometrist was very forthcoming with my prescription (in the past, my old optometrist made it hard for me to attain, I assume to drive more sales through their own frames), so now I can go to other retailers for stylish frames! Now that I write this, I regret not looking at the frames they had in the office...

If you're looking for a new optometrist, you can stop looking, and just choose Stamper. I'm doubtful you'll find a better place!<//Review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Had a great experience there. I came in with glasses i bought off the internet, and they helped me adjust the frame to my needs. Also answered a lot of my questions and didn't charge a penny for everything. From the outside it looks a bit dull, but inside you'll find a very competent and helpful team!< /review>

<Text>Friendly staff and sales people, though beware they will immediately throw the most expensive frames at you first if you're buying.  Dr. Stamper was informative and friendly.  Prices for exams I think are a little cheaper than elsewhere I looked.  I don't think they have any really cheap frames.  As you can probably tell, money is an issue for me, so spending on new frames/glasses gives me a heart attack.  They did need 2 attempts to get my lenses correctly fabricated, so the nearly month long delay was a bummer,  but that is not something they do on site and they were courteous and prompt about rectifying it.  And I will also say they are willing to be fair when it comes to billing issues, but I'll spare you the details of that.< /Text>< Pictures>

I have been going for the last 12 years and they are the best!  I used to be prone to eye infections and they found dailies that are strong enough for me.  They are always up to date with the newest and latest technology but still get to know your lifestyle to help you make the right decisions. Certain contacts are not good if you stay up late or forget them for a day.  The staff is great too and Jose will fix your glasses if you drop in.   I highly recommend them!   The optimap system is also great so you don't have to spend hours with the dark sunglasses to dilate your eyes.

Also they were the only ones who were able to help me pick out a frame for glasses where I didn't look completely silly!  10 stars for that.< /Text>

<text>Hi!,

Given my age, as well as my bad luck, I've had, and currently have, some health problems, but considering my personal situation, I honestly think that I'd prefer to die rather than going blind. Some three years ago, a bit of plaque was found in the inside of one of my eyes. Fortunately,  subsequent examinations revealed that the plaque had just been "deleted." I was always made to feel welcome at Dr. Stamper's; the lovely and knowledgeable crew are all incredible --hey, I don't cook the best "tapa" in the world for just anybody! Perhaps even more important, I always felt fully confident that Dr. Stamper's concern, dedication, and professional know-how would ensure that I'd continue using my eyesight, and avoid above horrible plight.

I honestly give STAMPER OPTOMETRY five stars in every respect, would recommend it without any qualification, and I give them all my heartfelt thanks.

<Review>This office is very disorganized - (i) they forgot to ask me to take out my contacts for the pre-test so the pre-test results were useless (ii) they said I could walk-in at 9AM, then they called me to tell me they arranged a 915 appointment, but in the end, no one saw me until 940AM. (iii) the doctor tried to fist bump me upon leaving which I found to be patronizing and unprofessional.</Review>< user_name>

I have long been of fan of Stamper Family Optometry and now more than ever. I'm so happy I found Dr. David of the Stamper Clan. ( Three generations of eye docs in this office since 1913. ) After wearing hard contact lenses since age twelve other doctors told me I'd never be able to wear soft lenses. Dr. David, as opposed to his Uncle, Dr. Bruce (called by their first names to avoid the confusion of having two Doctor Stampers in the same office, ) suggested I take a lens holiday. After six months of only wearing glasses I returned and Dr. David was surprised but excited that my corneas looked nearly normal. Decades of polymer plastic lenses do tend to reshape the eye. Mine bounced back like memory foam! Next we discussed my options. Bi-focal glasses? No. Contacts and reading glasses?  No. What about monocular vision? I dunno. He explained and said it wasn't for everyone but I said I was willing to give it a try.

First he determined my dominate eye. This is the eye you use when looking through the viewfinder on a camera or a rifle for that matter. It usually corresponds to your dexterity. He then fitted my dominant left eye for distance vision. Then my right eye was fitted for close-up. He said some people know within an hour if they can do it or not. I was required to stay on the premises for an hour in the event I was one of those people who get nauseous or dizzy. I must say at first the concept alone almost made me cross-eyed but now I think of it as the Poor Man's Lasik Surgery. I could read the clock on a building a block away, I could read the tiny print in a text message and was relieved I didn't have to fumble about for my "reading glasses" to wear over my contacts like I had been doing for way too long.

I was hooked in the first fifteen minutes. No integration issues for my brain!  I don't miss seeing things in stereo, in fact my sight seems to be the best it's ever been and the contacts feel like a dream compared to the old school blind child hard lenses I endured for decades. Dr. David s a great find, he specializes in the "hard to fit" eye. The multi-lingual staff is another big plus. Jhosy got me up to speed on soft lens insertion and removal including a special tip for us "long-nailed" girls. Sweet Esmerelda gave me the visual  test; while Jose was busy tightening my sunglasses that were slipping down my nose but took it a step further and replaced the screw! Sixteen employees, some there ten to twenty years, multi-tasking with the synchronicity of a Swiss watch in their daily routine. The customer service and commitment to the patient's satisfaction is outstanding!</Text>

<text>The food is so, so good. And the service is friendly and competent.
But did I say, the food?  It's traditional Mexican to the point of being the best of Mexican. Everything is so fresh, and flavorful. We have fish tacos so plain and simple, and so good. Then the Chile Verde. It was not the tradition thick sauce, but thinner, fresher, and tastier. And the pork was marvelous. We will be going back to try many more things.
The ingredients and top notch and the preparation simply wonderful in its flavors. Give it a try, it's worth it.
Oh, and the prices are great as well.< /text>< time>

<text>Great find! I've been here 3 times now and always really enjoyed it, there is something for everyone here. I've tried burritos, fish, soups, all delicious. Amazingly, so far my favorite is the vegan burrito, so rarely is something vegan so close to the normal version - bursting with vegetables, spicy and it even feels cheesy.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Excellent service and extremely good food. Ordered the parihuela peruana... Seafood soup.  I asked for it to be not spicy for my toddler, and it came a little bit spicy the first time. When my server (Oskar) checked on me and saw that we were not eating it he proactively changed it for me to a non spicy one, and it was delicious! The mussels were really good and the fish in there and shrimp were also good. Only thing is octopus in there was chewy. Side of garlic bread was finger licking good. My toddler ate it all up super fast (minus the octopus). And she's a foodie. So when she eats it I know the food is very high quality. Also ordered a side of vegetables which came as cauliflower, broccoli and carrots cut very tiny, sauteed with salt and butter. Delicious as well. Especially when I put it in the soup to eat together. Overall great experience. Would definitely come back and try the other dishes!

Second time here and continue to be impressed. Ordered the:
*Red snapper... Wow. Perfectly cooked. Will order again
*Churrasco.. good. Prefer the fish.
*Our favorite side veggie.. still awesome!
Even had some live music tonight!  Single guitar player.</Review>

I went there while on Jury duty.  Ordered "chicken nachos,"  which really isn't a hard order.  OK.  Stale, bagged chipped.  Compensate with good cheese nope.  Mix of "nacho" (melted) cheese, and grated cheese.  Not much of either, and neither was good.  Back to the stale bagged, sell in bulk chips.

Beans were ok.  But this was supposed to be "chicken" nachos.  There wasn't any chicken on my order at all.

I won't be back.<//review>

< Review>
Dr. Neda Khodai, is one of the best dentists in Orange County.
She is highly skilled and cares about her patients and so does her staff.
My family and I, had been visiting Dr. Neda Khodai’s clinic for over 10 years and we are extremely pleased with the dental care we received.
We are grateful for the dental care we receive and I strongly recommend Dr. Khodai to you for all your dental care.

Barranca Dental office is extremely clean and spacious. Ms. Veronica is an excellent hygienist with high attention to detail.  Dr. Khodai is very knowledgeable and extremely energetic.  Her work is top notch. I have had two crowns done by her in the past three years and I am very satisfied with my painless experiences. I highly recommend Barranca Dental.<//Text>

Barranca Dental is hands down the best! Dr. Khodai is very skilled and the staff is always very nice and accommodating. The office is absolutely gorgeous with televisions in every room! It literally borders between a dental office and a Day spa ;) With leading edge technology and exceptional dental care Barranca Dental provides the type of quality that is worth smiling about : )<//Review>

My husband and I have been coming here for almost 7 years. I completely trust Dr Khodai. I have several
older fillings and appreciate her judgment/conservative approach. We’ve both been very happy with the quality of work and treatments we have received over the years. The other professionals are great and the new building is beautiful!<//Text>

<review>First visit, I found them on Google with good reviews so I thought why not. Everyone was really friendly and knowledgeable. The doctor and her assistant made sure I understood what I needed done and made me feel comfortable. I will continue my treatment with them. I highly recommend this dental office.
Third visit in and I feel extremely comfortable and satisfied with the care I've received. Dr. Khodai and her lovely staff are wonderful. I highly recommend this dental office.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have a hard time staying awake in the Chair.

My recent visit was the install of a Dental Implant.  I am glad Dr. Khodai is so quick and efficient with her procedures.
There was absolutely no pain during the procedure.  I have had multiple implants so this was not a new procedure for me.  If this visit had gone past the hour, I would have had problems staying awake.
I was so comfortable that I started to get drowsy.
I am so happy that I have Dr. Khodai for my Dental work.  I just have to drink more caffeine so I don't fall to sleep during her procedures.</review>< Name>

I have been going to Dr Khodai for over 5 years and find her highly skilled, personable and adept  at utilizing the latest technology. She recently moved a few blocks into a spacious new office where I was happy to see the same efficient and  friendly office staff along with her excellent dental hygienist assistants (my favorite is named Veronica).  I highly recommend  Dr Khodai to my friends and family and feel grateful to have a such a competent dentist who I truly feel I can trust.< /review>

A couple years ago Dr. Khodai noticed my wisdom teeth caused my gum pockets to get deeper and immediately sent me to the oral surgeon. They discovered a benign growth in my jaw. So they removed my wisdom teeth and did a bone graft. If she didn't send me to the oral surgeon my left jaw would eventually fracture due to bone loss and i'd have to have reconstructive surgery. So thankful!</text>< pictures>

I have been to see Dr. Khodai, multiple times over the last several years. Poor genes and my own sugar habit have really caused me to have multiple issues, from teeth needing to be pulled, to root canals, to fillings. She even noticed a tongue ulcer and immediately recommended I see an Oral Surgeon specialist. Through it all she is there for me. She and her staff make a point to get to know you and your situation and they always make me feel like part of the family. Regardless of the work she is doing or the cleanings her staff is helping to complete, she always goes the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable and clearly understand all of your options. She will show you the xrays and where the problem is, she will explain why she is holding your mouth open in the way she is. As many questions as you have she will answer. I cannot say enough good things, and yes I recommend her to all my friends and family.</review>

<Review>The whole group are wonderful to visit. Everyone is excellent and make me feel comfortable and important.

Dr. Khodia is at the top of her game. Starting with the care she gives her patients to the business she is building. Giving her team a great work environment and most importantly her patients a better experience.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dcdc2424b0cc19:0xdd531b77667860c1< /gmap_id></record>

Dr Khodaie is professional with EXCELLENT work ethics, her office staff are sufficient and helpful.
Last year I start going to Dr Khodaie after years of not so good experience with other dentists.

I have done implants, crowns and wisdom tooth pulled with no pain and or complications!! I amazed with her excellent job!! She is kind, caring, fast, gentle and best of all excellent dental work. I can’t thank you enough Dr. Khodaie

This is coming from a patients with days of pain, infections and redoing wrong job with implants, crowns, root canals, and more  with other dentists.
THANK YOU</review>

The warm energy of the office makes this office, is ideal for any consumer to feel welcome. The staff is very professional, they made my shy 11 year old son laugh and enjoy his appointment. (It was almost unbelievable)

The level of service at this office is beyond 5 stars, I found our new dentist.

I had an amazing experience, I put my trust in Dr. Khodai and got nothing less than excellent work done on my teeth. We’re not finished just yet and I’m actually excited to go in to finish up the job. She will walk you through everything and she really knows what she’s doing! 100% value. I would recommend to everyone I know.<//Text>

<Time>1598463724879<//Time><review>Love it there  and I am one that hates the dentist normally  I just had an implant done in one day  and on day 2 , I am out and about .the only thing that is tender is where the shots were given and not the actual procedure and no pain meds needed  after .all I had was 2 Tylenol before bedtime . the only meds I had before surgery  was Just one Valium and that’s it .did not need to be put under . So yes I would recommend every one to come here. The stall is all great too</review>< user>

Dr. Khodai and her team are wonderful! I’ve had some traumatic experiences in the past that have left me terrified of coming back to see a dentist but Dr. Khodai makes me feel at ease. I can honestly say I enjoy coming to the dentist now! I highly recommend her!</Text>

I just finished up my first surgical procedure for my first implant. Dr. Khodai and her team are by far the best in the industry. I was scared. They gave me every comfort I needed. Assurance, orange juice and personal stories that made me truly understand they know what we go through. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. ❤️  If I didn’t hug all of you, consider yourself hugged.<//review>

Dr. Khodai and her staff are by far the best dentistry practice I have ever been to. I've had multiple procedures here and have never felt any pain throughout, which I was very nervous about. Everyone there is very good at explaining to me what the situation is with my teeth and the science behind it. Her hygienists are amazingly friendly, and I love coming in just to see them and have a chat. The most pleasant dental experience you will ever have!< /Text>

I have been going to Dr. Khodai for years and she is amazing! She really cares about your well being and is not just in for the money (like a lot of dentist I’ve been to). Her staff is so friendly and she is always evolving. I have recommended her to all my friends and family. Hands down the best dentist I’ve been to!! Thank you!< /review>

A very professional staff, and a very clean and nice dental office. Dr. Khodai is an experienced dentist who is also very caring. I have been going to this dental office for the last 15 years. And I would not go anywhere else.</review>

<Text>Having just moved to the area, I needed to find a new dentist.  Dr. Khodai was close to my new home, received good reviews, offered Saturday appointments and was part of my dental plan so I scheduled an appointment. All of the staff I met during my visit were extremely nice, engaged and answered all of my questions.  Dr. Khodai spent a lot of time with me and offered great suggestions on how to take care of some of the dental issues I had been having.  I had a great experience and will be a long and loyal customer!<//Text>< rating>

<Review>I've been going to Dr. Khodai for several years now.  She is a great doctor, very knowledgeable and has the best bedside manners.  I came to her by recommendation after my crown work was completely botched by another doctor and the tooth underneath kept hurting despite of several adjustments. Dr. Khodai was able to find the problem and fixed it for me, no more pain or discomfort.  Her office is clean and inviting and all the staff members are pleasant.</Review><user_id>113916741756251668648< /user_id>< Date>

Dr. Khodai is the absolute best! I had so many bad experiences with dentists before I met her. She helped me overcome my fear and frustration with dental visits. Every single time I visit, whether it's for a cleaning, filling, or anything else, I am always treated with professionalism by the entire staff and I'm always well taken care of there. Their service is impeccable! I'm always treated with respect and honesty. I never have to worry about being lied to or deceived. I would recommend her to anyone who is looking for a reliable, friendly, trustworthy dentist. She is definitely my dentist for life and I will continue coming to her even if I end up moving far away!<//text>

Our family has been going here for years. I highly recommend Dr Khodai and her team. They are usually right on time.  The only negative feedback, from my child, is that the toothpaste they used on her latest cleaning was raspberry flavored which she did not like.< /Text>

I recently experienced a toothache and needed to find a nearby dentist. I found Barranca Dental online and saw many good reviews so I decided to call to see if they had any available appointments. Dr. Khodai and her team were helpful and I was able to come in for an appointment the next day. The service was great and Dr. Khodai and her team were very professional, nice, and made me feel welcomed. I was treated efficiently and painlessly, and now I no longer have a toothache. I think I found my new dentist, and will most likely be returning in the future. If you are looking for a new dentist, I highly recommend Dr. Khodai and her team!<//text>

I’ve been seeing Dr. Khodai for the past two years and I can say that she totally changed my perspective on going to a dentist. The energy she put in the clinic along with her experience and skillful hands make all the difference.

In all my visits I received the same excellent treatment. Sandra always goes out of her way to educate me and does her best to accommodate my needs as well as explaining my options. Dr. Khodai always makes sure I get the best treatment. The staff is so friendly and the clinic is always neat and welcoming.</review>

Unfortunately, she is now super busy. Last time, I called wanting to talk pricing on putting in an implant. Front desk girls kept putting me hold and I never got to talk to anyone. After calling several times, I finally told the front desk gal-hey-you guys keep on putting me on hold. She says-"WE ARE VERY BUSY, YOU KNOW". Did not apologize-nothing. I said-Well then and hung up. They lost a patient. I don't care how good a dentist is-your font desk need to learn manners<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I was recommended to Dr. Khodai via a friend, he raved about her work, so I decided to go and take my son too. The staff is very professional and nice. Waiting area and entire office is clean, they have a small fridge with waters for patients. We both got our x-rays done and our 6-month cleaning, I must say I felt the difference of what was done to me with my past dentist and how Dr. Kohdai staff works. Definitely will come back for dental work and I highly recommend her.</Text>< Response>

<text>Dr Khodai is amazing! She answered my call herself the day after Christmas, even though her office was closed, and called in an emergency script for my issue! Her staff immediately followed up the next day, and worked me in the rotation even though no openings were available and I couldn't give a specific time of when I could be there. They are all amazing, but Dr Khodai has been my dentist door almost ten years. I can't imagine seeing someone else!!</text></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Neda Khodai is an excellent dentist.
She is very knowledgeable and updated with all the latest in her dentistry profession.
Her beautiful smile,  kind personality and her gentle touch makes you feel great. I've been her patient for many years and she has always been there for me even during the challenging times and been very successful every time.
She caters to Cowards!
Every member of her staff has been specially trained to be friendly, approachable, gentle, kind and caring.
I highly recommend Dr Khodai at Barranca Dental Excellence.❤️<//Text>

<text>I love Dr Khodai . She explains everything she is doing and her injections are painfree. I find her

very knowledgeable.
Everyone is very friendly. It is the  first time I have ever felt relaxed in a dentist’s office. I gave
4 stars instead of 5 as I was kept waiting 25 mins for my appt.< /text><time>1553738487232</time><Rating>4<//Rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Dr. Khodai is a wonderful doctor and so are her staff!  I have been going to her for over 11 years, even when I lived in LA for about 8 years.  I moved back to Irvine, and so glad that I did because I'm now close to her again.  I completely recommend everyone to go see her. Her work and care are impeccable!

She has taken great care of me and my teeth and smile.  Just recently this week, one of my molars chipped.  Thankfully I wasn't in pain but also thankfully Dr. Khodai was able to see me within 2 days.  She fixed my tooth pain free.

Thank you Dr. Khodai and to all of the wonderful staff, especially Jackie!  You are all the best!<//Review>

I've been with Dr. Khodai and her awesome, competent, friendly staff for many years now and highly recommend Dr. Khodai for her great service to anyone in need of dental care. Her office is state of the art and the care she and her office staff provides are exceptional! Her minimal pain approach keeps me coming back year after year. I appreciate Dr. Khodai and her wonderful staff and you will too if you give her a try.</review>

I  had to return office without seeing the doctor after waiting long 40 min. The front desk did  mkt care that my appointment time at 2 wa passing by long 40 min. She was busy in the phone. I interrupted her. She gave me the message  that there will be additional  delay. I returned to the office

I wish they could have informed me about this delay. I  visited this place first time and I won't go again.<//Review>

Dr. Khodai was informative as she was diligently working on my tooth, she provided me with excellent care all with a kind demeanour and pleasnat hand. I told her and her team how scared of needles I was and they provided me iwth extra care to ease my tension. I can not recommend Dr. Khodai and her team enough.

< review>
Best dental practice I have been to in my global life. Friendly, kind, and understanding of the people who are apprehensive of dentists. Flawless billing and explanation of dental billing challenges.

To be completely honest; I am probably one of the most difficult patients to deal with. I ask way too many questions; probably more than are necessary. I am ALWAYS apprehensive about any work that needs to be done and it takes me at least 3 months to do thorough research and make any sort of important decision in my life. Lastly, as I have been told by others and am figuring out myself; I have come to expect unrealistic results—Perfection!  But in all fairness, I have had my crown redone three different times and all three times I have been extremely disappointed in the lack of knowledge of the dentists and the results received.

Now…I just have to say that Dr. Khodai is the exception. It is emphatically apparent that Dr. Khodai cares about her craft and knows it better than any dentist I have EVER experienced. Seeing how passionate Dr. Khodai is only makes the whole experience of getting work done that much more exciting and fun. I can say with confidence that Dr. Khodai really cares about every single patient that walks into her practice and does everything in her power to provide them with the best dentistry possible.

I am absolutely over the moon happy with my new crown and so appreciative of all the hand holding Dr. Khodai did to ensure we did everything we could to receive such perfect results. Her prices are extremely competitive (I honestly thing she has the best prices around). You can never pay anyone enough to care, and Dr. Khodai and her team CARE!!< /review>

Excellent value.  Specialties are their baked goods which are extraordinarily good.  Location is a bit out of the way but still close enough.  Plenty of parking.  Only open for breakfast and lunch.  Wish they had better tables and chairs.< /Review>

Pretty average place to eat.  The most anyone part of the breakfast was the waitresses.  One came to get my drink order (water) and didn't bring it.  Someone else asked me and brought it maybe 10 minutes later.  When the rest of our party came in, we ordered their drinks and again she forgot.  And she even got the drink order wrong (one iced tea, one water extra lemon and a Coke with a water).  Not terribly difficult.  When she did refill the drinks there was no ice so all the water was warm.  We even had to repeat the dessert order when standing right in front of her and it was only 2 tiny cupcakes.  They weren't even busy there was only two other tables occupied.  The food was very average, nothing terribly good not bad.  I've been to both locations and I would say Gilroy is definitely better.</text>

This place was not very good at all. My mushroom omelette was soggy & had no flavor. They forgot to give me an item that I ordered. And the waitress was a little rude & unfriendly. She didn't make eye contact or smile even once. It was also overpriced. My daughter and I will not be returning.</text>

The food here is very soggy and bland. I ordered a panini, and the bread was completely soggy--not toasty and crunchy. The menu said the onions were supposed to be caramelized, which was why I ordered it, but they were white and crunchy, almost completely fresh. The staff seems uncomfortable and inexperienced, because we waited a while before anyone ever took our order. And the coffee was so weak it looked like iced tea. Not wasting my money here again.<//review>

We ordered the scrambled eggs, panini, jalapeno scone, and a side of jalapeno jelly. The jalapeno jelly made everything taste 10x better. It was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. We will definitely be coming back here in the future when we go fruit picking. The price was super affordable for such high quality.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Rating>

<review>I was there this last weekend for lunch, here is my review
-  The service was ok at best, excuses excuses for the tardiness. I had lip stick on cup. I made the waitress aware of and she joked about it asking me if it wasn't my shade... i just look at her, really? it was disgusting!
- The food took longer than it should and was mediocre. My son's sandwich was soggy looked like they used a stick of butter, my daughters skirt steak sandwich wasn't trimmed, full of fat chunks and looked like it was just thrown together. My au jus for my french dip had no taste, just water with food coloring. The lemonade had a metallic taste, seemed like they didn't know how much Country Time lemonade powder to use. My wife's sandwich was the only thing that was fine. We left most of the food... just wasn't good

We wanted to like this place, but we'll pass on this restaurant next time.<//review><gmapID>0x808e26d543055961:0xfa08989c6a03dc00</gmapID>< date>

We've been coming here since we moved to MH on Feb of this year--- it's practically across the street from our house. One thing I can say though, very friendly. The place is named after their grandma Josephine. The menu is very light and has not changed in a while. Their baked goods are delicious, perfect for small parties but you can order caked and cupcakes however you wish. Everything is baked on site and you can tell they're made from scratch. Family friendly and the decor is always cheerful.</text>

While looking for a new local place to eat lunch we found Josephines. My friend and were treated like friends. This is a very nice family owned lunch spot. Great for a quick sandwich or baked goodies.< /Text>

<Text>This location is closing witch was a surprise, but discounted price was good.
Only issue is that the young girl cashier scanned the bar code on the item I wanted to purchase, and it came up $5 more than the tagged price, she told me that she had to sell it for the price the that came up on the screen. I mentioned that it had to be sold for price on the item. She finally called a manager and got the price corrected.
She is young and still learning. But all good now.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>I absolutely love Pier 1, so clearance Pier 1 is a dream. We had such a great experience here. All employees were super friendly and helpful and the store is kept well cleaned and organized. I love that everytime I come, something is even cheaper than I thought it was, so the total at checkout is always a pleasant surprise. Not sure if this is on purpose or a lazy pricing employee, but I don't care. Hope it stays this way. I tell everyone about the Pier 1 Clearance store.</review>< pics>

Always find great deals on pieces that are usually 50% off of regular price. Usually like new. Great deal on candle selection too.<//Review>

Only downfall is the price tags were inconsistent, but they are transitioning to a clearance pier one store. Beautiful pieces at great price.

<text>I'm always disappointed to be assailed as I come through the front door by what PI must think will be seen as Cheerful and helpful. Instead it is labored and off-putting. Just how hard can it be to look round a store, that I need guidance on where things are and what is on sale. This is furniture and clutter to put on shelves and coffee tables. I'll ask if I need help.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I waited outside for 40 mins for the store to open. It was not just me, but all the employees too. No explanation, other than the person with keys wasn't there. I complained to their 800# via text and what they do? Responded at 6:00 am on Sunday morning with a text, sayings "thanks for your text." I never made it back. #Ranting<//review>

Kamryn, helped us and she was ok but she seemed to be under the influence of something. Kamryn(our cashier) dropped the ladies candle in front of us and her speech was VERY SLURRED! As she began to ring us up she had a hard time finding the correct keys to press. Never asked how we were or did we find everything ok. After she found the correct keys she rang us up and bagged our items and then SLURRED thank you.< /Text>

They don't want to take orders. Are very slow. They want you to use kiosks only. There was a nice super spreader line of people waiting for food. I counted 10. Lucky we are in orange so no more corona. Lol this place sucks at ordering food.< /text>

I give the McDonald's located at 1451 Coleman Ave, Santa Clara, CA 95050 FIVE STARS. A kind staff that keeps its location clean. 5️⃣ 🌟's I've been to McDonald's throughout the entire us and not every McDonald's makes a good coffee in the morning, but this one sure does. The same applies for the McFries. 😷< /text>

< Review>
Now that they have those self ordering machines they no longer have anyone up front. I was there for 10 mins and didn't get even a, "We will be right with you." It wasn't even busy. I used to work at a McDonald's that had those machines and we were taught to still look at the front every minute. I feel that they could have done a better job there.

Came back to try and see if I can get better service. I ordered a large meal and they gave me a medium drink but charged me for a large. Now waiting for a sandwich that doesn't take long to make and might even make me late for work.<//Review>

Not very happy with the service here. For one they never fill my large drink to top of cup. I ask for no ice and looks like they only fill 3/4 full. Every time ! Even with ice . They still come way short !< /review>

McDonald's if you have never been there is a fast food restaurant that specializes in hamburgers, French fries and drinks. In fact they offer meal deals that come complete with entrée, side and beverage. Usually I only go here if I need a quick bite. Often times after eating here my stomach hurts for some reason. Really, McDonald's is not for everyday consumption because it is kinda unhealthy. There are more healthy items on the menu like salads and such, but usually I go for the burgers. Another highlight is the selection of milkshakes which are quite tasty and easy to drink through a straw.<//Text>

Drive-thru here is awful, they can barely hear you through the intercom and you have to repeat yourself several times.  Sometimes the people manning the drive-thru can't really multitask so they are prone to messing up your order, like they did today.  Could use a little improvement.</text>

Food as expected...
Consistently served hot, quickly and accurately.  The restaurant is generally staffed sufficiently to allow prompt service without staff being rushed.
Solid staffing may make operating costs higher, but make customer experience better.  Fewer mistakes and more polite & relaxed employees.</text>

Pretty sure I got sick here eating a chicken sandwich and fries.  The place wasn’t super clean inside and I should have known.  I thought, how can I get sick at McDonalds but I did.  This is the last time I will end up going here for food.  If I need quick good, I’ll try to swing over to the costco instead.  If you are over here for a snack before the airport, stay away</review>

<Text>OK so everything is relative, right? I mean McD's can't be judged on the same five star scale as a Ruth Chris', can it? This was a five star McDonald's experience. The food was hot and fresh (again relative). It took about two minutes longer than usual but that's because I got fries straight out of the fryer. The best part was the sweet lady that helped me. I wish I got her name but we can call her grandma. She was so nice and worried about me getting my food, it was nice to have that level of attention at a fast food place.< /Text><Name>Adam Kaplan< /Name>< Rate>

Every time we go to the drive thru they tell you to drive around to the otherside and park and everytime our order was in correct. So now you have to get out of your car and go inside. Defeats the purpose of a DRIVE THRU!</text>

Its McDonalds so you pretty much know what to expect foodwise. Service was friendly and quick. Restaurant and restrooms are clean. It's located next to the costco on coleman ave. Has a drive thru available. The only problem can be the long lines getting in and out of the parking during due to the large amount of Costco customers and only 2 entrance/exits to the entire shopping area.</text>

It's as good as any other McDonald's, but that isn't a very high standard. Use the drive through. If you go inside, it takes forever.< /Text>

Loss of a star due to no outlets to charge cell phone/tablet/laptop while dining.

Wi-Fi is here is one of the stronger ones compared to some other locations but could still be stronger for our extra power hungry apps such as Receipt Pal.

Great and friendly service.</Text>
