I signed up for this course through the American Red Cross. The convenience of doing the online portion, followed by in-person practical skills was great! Giovanni was an excellent instructor. He’s clearly skilled and experienced at what he does and I left the training session feeling prepared and confident to handle a variety of emergencies. It’s a great course!< /Review>

Giovanni was an incredible instructor. He not only provided a safe and effective environment to learn all the fundamentals of CPR through these challenging Covid-19 times, He took the time to answer and questions and concerns throughout the lessons. I gained immense knowledge and confidence. He is thorough and his manner of instruction is clear, thought provoking and respectful. He validates what you understand and challenges you to think one step ahead. He is passionate about CPR and First-Aid training and has decades of experience and professionalism  to add to his teaching. I am deeply appreciate that I had the opportunity to learn from him and have recommended this course to everyone that inquires about quality and high standard training. Thank you!<//Review>

I took the First Response CPR/AED class with Edgar A. as our instructor. The class was very informative and fun. I wasn’t sure what to expect and I’m glad I took it. We had real world examples and explanations which made me more comfortable with performing CPR and first aid. I seriously recommend this class and location as it was easy to locate and had a very intimate setting.</text>

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I took the classes online, and the skills exam for BLS for healthcare providers in-class.  The location is safe and easy to get to (no traffic!).  Giovanni was extremely knowledgeable, professional and clear, and safety during COVID precautions was highly respected.  Even though it was just a skills exam, I still ended up learning important practical tips because he's such a pro!  One of the best classes I've ever taken and streamlined with the blended online/classroom formats.</Review>

The class was a great workout for my arms (with all the compression we do on the model haha). Engage in the class and you will pass! Oh, warning: there are dad jokes, but I actually like them, it shows how great Giovanni personality is. I would definitely recommend the class!

He answered all my questions even when it didn’t pertain to the subject we were on. He’s very knowledgeable & I will definitely use these skills I’ve learned & apply them in real life events for sure! 👌🏻 Took this class because I’m a mother of two and always with my children- some cases happened where I wasn’t able to do the bare minimum to help my child (I felt awful) instead I rushed to ER. Wish class was longer. Thanks again!< /Text><Name>Emery Gonzalez</Name><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I love the fact that we each had a mannequin and we all had the same amount of time to practice on each technique.The instructor is very lively and knowledgeable. I will definitely take my future classes here.😄< /Review><Date>1608086971312< /Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures><UserId.>102006479815515877829</UserId.><username>toni 777</username>< Resp>

What a great educational experience. I’ve done multiple classes throughout the years, but this one tops them all. Giovanni was great at answering all questions and providing rationales.Even during the pandemic, did AHA course online and the skills here. Equipment clean, hand sanitizer and gloves provided.</Review>

<review>Just renewed my BLS and had the best experience.  The class was fun and the instructor is extremely knowledgeable.  The instructor Giovanni makes it a safe environment by strictly following COVID safety guidelines.  Masks are worn during class, hand sanitizers are available at each desk and upon entering class, also air purifiers on at all times, room is spacious enough to sit 6feet apart and all equipment is cleaned. If you are looking to learn in a fun and safe environment, I highly recommended this class.<//review><userid>116508114377227383975</userid>< Date>

I walked in full of doubt, questioning the knowledge that was already inside of me and too timid to act on things that I already knew. I walked out of this class feeling like superwoman. My instructor was thorough, relatable, patient and explain scenarios  in ways that I could directly put myself into the settings of the situation.

Walked in, sanitized, took my temperature & started the course! No games. You will definitely learn exactly what you need to learn to become the vital High-Performed CPR healthcare worker that you need to be in the chance of an emergency.

I needed to renew my BLS card and was honestly kind of nervous getting it done during this pandemic, but I was amazed at the level of safety precautions taken to ensure the safety of the students and the instructor. I will definitely be back once I need to renew my BLS card again and will be recommending it to all of my friends. Giovanni was the best and I can not say enough great things!</Review>

<text>Just renewed my CPR First Aid and AED certification and the training was phenomenal. Gio did a great job with instruction and answering questions. Definitely will be coming here more often and will send friends and staff needing training to this center.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x80dd35e5434899e3:0x65f2481434ef3cf5<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have been a client a few times here at the Paul Mitchell School and I am seriously getting more impressed with my visits.  The supervisor Jacob, of which I cannot even begin to come up with the right words to express my most sincere graditute for this gentleman. He went far and beyond to make sure I was informed about everything and gave me the rest assurance I was in good hands, and I was .  I came walking out feeling like a supermodel.  All the students who worked on me were so eager to learn  and made me feel so comfortable.  Money and time well spent. And I will most definitely be back.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Cosmetology school that provides salon services @ much reduced fair by PM students learning this field. Practicing on those enquiring services; teaching instructors monitor guiding over them. I like coming in & getting my hair: cut, colored, treated, toned, conditioned, corrected & styled  every now and again.<//Review>

First of all, I completely understand that this is a school and a space for learning. So, it is at no fault of the students (more an issue with organization of the institution as a whole).

I am not going to write an entire sob story, but I would not recommend going here for any color (can't speak to the other services) unless you know the student that you trust. Unfortunately the lack of mentorship throughout the entire process led for me to leave the institute after sitting in a chair for 8 hours, paying over $120 and going to get it fixed the next day (today) at a salon for an additional $500 because it was so damaged.

Anyway, I know I walked in accepting the risk of working with students, but truly... I did not know it would be this shockingly bad.< /text>< Pictures>

Great place to have haircut, color, and shampoo plus style. Great products to choose from, especially anti-hair loss products. The student hairdresser, Jen, is very patient and friendly. Most of all, she's time efficient @ her services and she's very eager to learn from the instructors about the critiques and latest tips. Will go back for services while I'm @ gym in Galleria.</text>

The school is no longer like it was prior to covid. It's turned into one of the worst beauty schools with minimal professionalism,  value, quality or reliability.  While the customers are used as helpless Guinea pigs,  no one bothers to guide the students or give them any real help. The kids running the place, were pretty intimidating and aggressive.  The old paul Mitchell school is not the same</Review>

I will often go for a blow out.  The hairstylists are always friendly and the price is unbeatable.  Give yourself between 1- 1 1/2 hours though, as they are all students and my hair is long and curly and it takes much longer than the professionals at Dry Bar... but as Dry Bar costs $49, Paul Mitchell is $12.  Plus.. the ones at Paul Mitchell also give a great hair wash!<//review>

ALI did an amazing job.  I can’t believe they are just students !.  My hair looks shiny and much much younger feeling. She is amazing and very professional. I highly recommend. Just is good to know that every services takes longer than regular hair salon because they still learning  !!!  Beautiful job 👏</Review>

I came her with my mom and my sister for a haircut 💇🏻‍♀️ They told us that we had lice and that they could not complete the haircut until we had the live removed. We all freaked out and immediately headed to hair wizards where they told us we did not have lice. . . we had dandruff 🤦🏻‍♀️ It was the instructor who thought we had lice, which made it even worse; we were so furious that we went to Western Beauty Institute instead where, thank goodness, we had a much better experience.

In short, don’t waste your time here.<//Text>

< Review>
I have been here coming for years with mixed success. Today I rushed here from work for a pre set appointment only to be told that there is no record of the appointment and my request can't be accommodated. I understand that this is a school but basically telling me that there's no accountability for  people who fail to properly book an appointment and refusing to give me an option to confirm an appointment is unacceptable. Nothing but attitude from the instructor who clearly felt the conversation was a waste of his time. Part of this training should be customer service, something he doesn't seem to know much about.</Review>

<text>So for the last couple months I have been coming to the Paul Mitchell Beauty School. Overall I’ve had a pretty good experience, I think many people forget that these men and women are students and still developing their practices and aren’t always going to know what to do. So patience and kindness is key. With that being said, I’ve been seeing an old friend’s sister here and she is amazing, unfortunately I haven’t had the best experiences with the instructors. They are often rude and difficult for my friend to pin down, there have been times when she has looked for just someone to help her and there hasn’t been anyone for a while and I myself haven’t seen them on the floor either. I am in the process of going platinum and unfortunately the Instructor who assisted last time asked the girls who were doing my hair not to use foils when lightening. Unfortunately I was wearing my late grandfather’s sweatshirt, and it’s been bleached for the lightening product as well as the top that was underneath it, I didn’t think that anything would happen to my clothes, had I, I would’ve worn something different so obviously it wasn’t expected, but it was certainly a let down because I would’ve expected someone to catch that. Things ran late that day, my friend had to go to work after the school closed, so the Sarah, the instructor, finished my hair. We finally got my hair to an 8-9, ready to get to a level 10 for the following session and my friend gave her instructions saying that she wanted a certain toner in my hair. Sarah ended up putting grey in and only told me it was grey while it was going in. I left with my hair just as dark as before, looking greenish (despite it being a grey toner, it looked green), and it was a patchy job. I’m not one to complain about something like this, but I’ve spent hundreds of dollars since September/October on my hair and now I’m questioning if I should continue with you guys, if I’m only going to have a fairly mediocre experience next time. :(< /text><Name>Elise Jonke</Name><user_id>105157843985561402844<//user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><Time>1545267263223<//Time>< Rating>

If you are someone who is incredibly meticulous about your haircut, come here. If you’re someone like me, who just does a mandatory cut once a year, don’t go here. I was sat for about 2 1/2 hours for a cut that looks no different than when I could’ve done myself.  Everyone was kind and patient, customer service was great, I just wish the person cutting my hair knew how to move at a reasonable pace and cut more than five strands of hair at once< /text>

This was my 4th and probably last time going to this place. The first two times I had the same hairstylist, and she was great. Third time she wasn’t the best, but I understood she was a student. But yesterday I left there in tears. The person cutting my hair did not know what she was doing. She even pulled up her iPad to look how how to part my hair for the haircut. I ended up changing my hairstyle because I could see she had zero clue about what she was doing and I was getting super nervous. When she pulled out her iPad to check how to do layers, I was like ok just leave it as is.  I said forget the layers. But the worst part was when she tried to style my hair and blow it dry. It turned super puffy. The teachers were nowhere to be found. At 8 pm the teacher came and said they were closing, but I could could come back tomorrow and she might fix it! She refused to even put any product in it to make it better. I understand that these are students that are learning, but they won’t be doing it on my hair. Too bad because I had such a great experience with the first stylist, but I can see that was probably just luck.</Text>

I've been having my hair done here for about three years.   I take a day and pamper myself and let them do their thing.  I have never been disappointed.  It's a slow process..........give yourself a break and sit back and enjoy it.  If you are want a rush job...........this is not the place for you.  Understand that from the beginning and you should be fine.  I personally, love this place.  (Trish)< /Review>

<time>1462324509184</time><rate>2</rate><Review>So I have been to the one in Sherman Oaks many times but honestly it is a hit or miss. I've had good experiences and less than desirable experiences. And unfortunately I think I'm just over the guessing game. This last time I went in for a cut and color, as I usually do, and it typically seems like the students don't have the stamina to do a long session like that. But because of this, I always keep my entire day open.
Unfortunately my hair was sacrificed this last visit.
I asked for the same color all over, no highlights, and she missed spots! Underneath and on the side of my head. Now when I put my hair in a pony tail you can see the missing spots (an ugly Orange color on my dark hair); I'm so embarrassed by it. And the hair cut was fine but not what I asked for! I asked to keep the same shape and instead they took too much off and it has really hard edges. And of course this was the time it had to cost more then usual. I paid a lot of money for a botched job and now I'm going to have to go pay even more money somewhere else to have this all fixed. I finally learned my lesson and don't think I'll be coming back. If you don't mind not knowing what will happen to your hair and just looking to pay less, go for it! But this last experience has ruined it for me.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Honestly reading all of these reviews right now and they are all so funny. If you people want to get a good haircut, color or whatever THEN GO TO A PROFESSIONAL. You guys are all complaining about STUDENTS messing up your hair. Well news flash THEY ARE ALL LEARNING. You get what you pay for and you should all not blame PEOPLE IN TRAINING. Cut the bs. And pay extra to someone with experience instead of saying the school is horrible. You all sound ridiculous.<//Review>< pics>

1st off-The school needs someone to manage the front desk (figure out iPad mobile ck in or sonthing). We had appts for 5pm however the front desk bottle neck with 20 ppl in line did not allow us to ck in until 530. The senior hair stylists were doing their best to manage those of us concerned with our ck in issues. Paul Mitchell school HIRE A REAL front of shop manager.
2nd-Arrive WAY WAY early. The location is in a weird "Galleria" with like a few restaurants, movie theater, dsw, and 2 odd clothing stores. Many many vacant store fronts. Strange vibe.
Lastly, my stylist Taylor was supposed to be  level "2" and she was not and I am so satisfied that I am returning Thursday for some color.

My daughter got a level 2 stylist named Bailey.  She was very insecure, left color on her scalp and left lines of demarcation along hair line. She needs to learn to fake it and get some confidence. Poor thing. She was so nice, but my daughter will see Taylor moving fwd.

Renee was a fabulous instructor to Taylor while she was trimming my hair. Loved him. He is well respected by the students and other instructors. He is what's up.

Thanks!</Review>< rate>

< Review>
I used to be a weekly client for a shampoo and blow out but stopped going for a variety of reasons. Emails of, "We miss you!!!!"  started arriving. Yesterday (January 29, 2014) I had an appointment at 11AM for a shampoo and blow out. I arrived at 10:55am and filled out the appropriate paperwork. I was told to "have a seat" on the couch and that someone would be with me "shortly."  This appointment to do my hair was in preparartion for a 1:30PM business luncheon in a restaurant very near by. At 11:10AM I began doing the crossword puzzle in the back of a PEOPLE magazine. At 11:20AM I finished this third grade challenge and looked to the desk to see if anyone remembered that I was sitting there. It appeared not. At 11:25AM with a knot in my gut I decided to leave. At 11:26AM a very nice student with auburn hair and a beautiful smile came to me and said that she was ready to do my hair. Too late.  I have electric rollers..........The MAIN PURPOSE of this review is to laud the elegant African American gentleman from New Jersey who answered the telephone when I called shortly after leaving to complain to the manager about my latest experience at this place. He validated my complaint and we both agreed that, "11AM means 'before 11:10AM' " and apologized for my less than stellar experience. He assured me that my next visit would make up for this one and to please not be discouraged again from returning. This man is a MAJOR ASSET to your company!!!  He should conduct a customer service workshop!!!  Will I chance another disappointing visit?? Maybe but I have electric rollers so......maybe not!!!! Either way, I am very grateful to this gentleman who knew what to say, how to say it and had a smile in his voice. Ideally, The Paul Mitchell School in Sherman Oaks treats him better than they treat random clients!!!! Thank you!!!!</Review>

I went last Thursday and was initially a little skeptical because I am bi-racial and my hair is curly, but I was paired with Else Reyes  (#2924) and she was amazing! She did such a beautiful job and was very gentle. I will request her from now on.<//review>

I had a coloring which turned out amazing!  I also loved my blow out.

Great job all around for a fantastic price :)<//Text>

<text>Receptionists ARE MORONS! I used to get my hair done there in Sherman Oaks back in 2012, 2013. It was great, everyone was nice. Anytime, NOW and last year that I have called, the phone WORKERS are rude, hateful of their little 9.00 jobs and disrespectful. I went once and hated them up front so much I left..did not stay to get my hair done.
When i call, after a year or more, seeing if things have changed...they keep hanging up the phone.., many times it.s immediate you call back they put you on hold and AGAIN, keep hanging up. They.re so stupid they don.t even know how to work their phones.
They are also nasty with awful dispositions. I will be contacting the corporate office.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Student #2313 is professional, takes her time to make sure she is getting it right and is concerned that she is doing what you want. The teachers are pleasant and take their time with the student to make sure you're getting the style you want. Remember, this is a school, and the time it takes to get your hair done will vary and at times take long, but for the price and quality of service you get, it's worth it.</review>< user_name>

Make sure you ask for phase 2! Its a bit more expensive, but waaaay better that having a risk of potentially having your hair ruined!  Good thing I learned that early on, after I has a student who was simply afraid to cut my hair, and was just standing there....... been coming here for years. These people are STUDENTS,  so you are coming on your own risk. Always make sure to communicate to the teacher if you are having problems. And, make an appointment with Phase 2 as I already mentioned.  Those people are near their graduation, so they know what they are doing. Otherwise, unfortunately a lot of times it seems as no one cares there...like other reviews mentioned, front desk barely responds to the phones, or all the stuff is just too busy chatting with each other.</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Poor customer service. I showed up 30 mins early and one of the receptionists asked me to come back at the time of my appointment so I went to dsw to kill time. I came back and saw one was chatting with a friend and the other on the phone so I sat down, 25 mins later I asked the guy if I was going up any time soon and he said “you never checked in” then said he wondered why no one had called me. I had an uneven haircut but I wasn’t upset because I understand these are students and they are learning however a basic haircut took well over two hours. I didn’t have time to make sure it was even. After combing it out at home (1 hr later) I realized one side was longer than the other. I called and said it was ok but if they can just straighten it out for me but received horrible customer service once again. I feel like they don’t really know what to say even when your’re making things simple (said I would pay AGAIN for someone to even it out)  I’m considering just going to a hair salon and paying twice the price but less of a headache. Sorry but I can’t recommend this place to anyone. Somehow it comes out more expensive in the end.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Awesome school, great staff teaching the latest and greatest techniques! !! We wouldn't send our daughter any place else!

To: Kyle Sheehan and all who read the her post. 1) yes, it is pricey, but I know for a fact and we were specifically told this before enrollment that if you are driven, motivated, looking to advance they will be right by your side, however if you're there simply to get your license, then that's where they'll "meet" you. So that's up to the student to decide. Also, what are your goals? There are many advantages by attending this school, including some amazing assistance with job placement,  such as at studios, actors, and very nice salons. They also DO IN FACT supply you with all of their professional supplies and products in a traveling case on your very 1st day, that includes, hair products ie, blow dryer, flat iron, curling iron, sprays, etc,  as well as all the spa supplies, makeup,  etc. The tuition also includes all of the doll heads, and the 2 books that you will need, 1 for color the other is for towards the end when they teach you all about how to pay taxes. There are no other books required because on the 1st day they give you a brand new iPad to keep with all the apps and software u will need, and this too is included in your tuition. We did plenty of research, we had 3 meetings before commiting, with all that said, Paul Mitchell is a great school. Oh and as far as the location, it's wonderful that's it's right off the freeway,  who wants to drive all through the valley if you don't have to. That's my 2 cents!< /text>

My dad was there for over a month before he was transferred to a Rehab facility.  The care, treatment, nurses and doctors were great and our family is very grateful.

Thanks again Barlow and a big hug to all of your nurses, Doctors, and staff.</review>

I took the COVID-19 Test in the noon， the COVID TEST site is next to the Hospital， but I cannot post review the test site on Google Map， so I post here. my appoint time is 12:30PM-2PM, but there is a very long line, hundreds of cars lining up on the street, eventually I waited two and half hours to take the test.

This place gets you on track to recovery quickly. From the professionalism of the staff to the facilities I was treated with the best care and respect. Once I was released from the hospital and transferred to Barlow, my rehab was expeditious. Thanks, Barlow!</Review>

<Text>My father had been bouncing around various levels of care for almost a year due to set backs after severe aspiration pneumonia. Working with the team at Barlow, my dad was able to finally start making meaningful and consistent progress, from ventilator through the process of weaning off the trach entirely. The staff were extremely helpful and as easy to get a hold of as you would hope. Barlow kept my dad and I informed of the week to week game plan for him and how various therapies would work with him. I would definitely recommend Barlow should the needs of yourself or a loved one require it< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

All I can say is that the staff went beyond to help my husband. From both his case managers Bethany and Yvette to his nurses on the Barlow flow: Manny, Kevin (go Eagles!) Kevin the respiratory therapist to G, Sue, Chanterelle, Maria at night and all the others. Both Ron and Naomi the charge nurses!!! His pt therapist and speech therapist who were great!!! Thank you for everything you all did for him!!!< /review>

<review>I had a relative at Barlow for about a month. We couldn't visit because of Covid-19 protocol but the staff did an amazing job keeping us in the loop. I can only imagine how difficult and stressful their jobs were in the middle of the pandemic but the nurses were always so friendly even though you could tell they were slammed. Dr. Conti and Dr. Shi were incredibly kind, calling with daily updates, answering any questions, extremely compassionate. Julia in the office was also fantastic!

With such a great team of people who are able to be so gracious even under such extraordinary circumstances, I'd recommend Barlow to anyone.< /review>< user_id>

My disabled son  Matthew was at Barlow for a second time. this time for 3 weeks.  What I love about Barlow and their staff is they treat Matt like  their own son. The care, love, and attention he receives is most welcomed by Matt's family. I highly recommend Barlow for any person who has respiratory issues<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>should you or a relative want a breathing health center, Barlow is the best place for treatment.  My husband changed into in the ICU of a nearby clinical center and required a ventilator to respire.  He wished enhance care to assist regain use of his lungs and i wanted to make certain he became dealt with at a facility which had the fine feasible effects.  After an awful lot studies, I did my darndest to make certain he might be transferred to Barlow and i've now not had one 2d of regret.

My husband turned into a "hot mess" when he changed into admitted to Barlow respiration hospital, including bacterial infections and a previously untreated wound, all of which needed to be addressed earlier than his lungs may want to start their journey again to health.  In brief order the infectious disorder specialist and wound expert took care of these setbacks and the breathing therapists have been waiting to begin their paintings.  The workforce at Barlow will now not surrender on a affected person - my husband is a quadriplegic (which provides any other fly to the ointment) and had multiple starts offevolved and stops in his ventilator "weaning". whenever, the breathing therapy personnel restarted the technique and nowadays he is strong enough to breathe 12+ hours according to day with out the ventilator and increasing each day!!!

further to the docs and breathing staff, I have to ship a large shout out to the nursing workforce.  They offer extraordinary care to my husband and we are very impressed with their skills and commitment to affected person care. conversation in the age of COVID-19 is difficult. I cannot be on the medical institution asking questions, however the nurses are superb. once I, or my daughter, name for an replace, commonly we are in a position to talk with a nurse immediately.  in the rare times whilst my husband's nurse for the day is unavailable at that moment, we always receive a name returned in a well timed manner.  constantly.  moreover, we are able to speak with my husband at some stage in the day and evening through FaceTime  (or WhatsApp for non Apple customers). We in no way sense as though we're interrupting and every body is courteous, helpful and honestly nice to cope with.  i am sorry that I do now not mention staff by way of call but I don't want to leave anyone out as all were extra special!!!

My husband also gets occupational and physical therapy.  As I referred to, he's a quadriplegic.  someday ultimate week I acquired an sudden FaceTIme from his p/t. My husband was able to lift his legs a bit (first time on his very own!) and the p/t concept my husband would possibly need to FaceTime me to rejoice. first-class call ever!

eventually, i would be remiss if I did not send kudos to Bethany, the Social worker with whom I deal often on the whole lot from disability office work to my husband's emotions.  She is very handy and on top of the needs of each the affected person and own family individuals. while Bethany sensed i used to be overwhelmed via my husband's troubles, she installation a zoom meeting for my daughter and me so that we ought to "meet" the group of workers treating my husband and ask any questions about his reputation and remedy plan.  when I had extra questions following the assembly, Bethany observed up with an appropriate workforce contributors.  She cares and goes "above and past"!

I made the right choice - Barlow respiratory medical institution is the excellent!< /text>< Pics>

I recommend Barlow Respiratory Hospital to anyone who has a family member on the ventilator. In March of this year my son was transferred to Barlow Respiratory Hospital, they weaned him off the ventilator, did speech therapy, had him on the speaking valve, he did 35 steps with assistance. This facility helped my son so much. Every since he has been discharged from Barlow, he has not gotten the help he needs. In July of this year he was sent out to for another procedure at a different hospital n ended back on the ventilator and in ICU. He is not in ICU anymore but he is still on the ventilator. I know if my son could back to Barlow, he can n will be weaned off the ventilator just like they did before. The case manager, nurses, speech n physical therapists really helped my son.< /text>

<Text>My brother was transferred to Barlow after being in ICU for 6 weeks at UCLA. Being severely ill with Covid and Covid Pneumonia, he was a miracle. Still had a lot of care needed and Barlow certainly continued his care. I was very hesitant about this hospital, simply because my brother is a UCLA patient and he is all UCLA affiliates. I was not pleased to learn he would be out of the UCLA system. Or so I thought. Barlow has the best attending UCLA Physicians..yes UCLA physicians. Not only that, from the start the staff was very welcoming and informative. They gave me peace of mind and answered all my questions. My brother has so many underlying conditions. Going into Barlow with a tracheotomy was not easy to accept for any of us. But Barlow was the right place for him! Barlow weened my brother off the ventilator, they provided wound care, they gave him speech therapy, and RNA therapy. The nurses were very kind to him. Nurse Ana from second floor, THANK you for always keeping me updating and staying on top of my brothers healthcare! Thank you to Ariel, Anastacia, Dr. Eng, Dr, Ramirez, Dr. Way, Hector (RNA therapist), Rafael, Dr. Brailey, Dr. Nelson AND the entire staff for doing such a wonderful job! My brother has now been transferred over to a sub acute in Santa Monica and where his care is being continued. They will continue to provide his therapies and we will soon be able to bring him home with or no trach. These last almost 4 months have felt an eternity but God is with us and we are so thankful to the Barlow staff! -The Martinez Family< /Text>< Resp>

My husband is one of the COVID “miracle” patients, whose system shut down in the ICU. Had to be vented, renal failure, struggled to come out of sedation. Relearning to eat, walk, etc. Complicated case that required so much care and patience during sedation delirium. Because my husband represents one of the worst Covid cases, I assume his doctors must be among the best, because it’s hard to just wing a case of Covid-induced multi-organ failure. I was told by friends that Barlow could work miracles, and now my husband is in acute rehab, which exceeded all initial expectations. He also claims that Barlow has, by far, the best hospital food. Like Whole Foods quality, only his was pureed due to the circumstances. Anyway. He is thrilled with his experience, and felt the nurses and therapists went above and beyond at Barlow, so five stars.<//Text>

My husband, Scott, was cared for by the staff at Barlow Respiratory Hospital in Los Angeles.  From the time he arrived, he was cared for with love and compassion.  The doctors and nursing staff, respiratory care and support services were very attentive to his medical condition and quick to respond when necessary.
Barlow was the right place for my husband to receive the medical care he required. Having a loved one in the hospital is a very difficult and stressful experience, however, I found it very peaceful to walk around the hospital grounds and to relax on the covered front patio, feel the warm breeze and listen to the birds. We were blessed to be at Barlow. I will never forget their kindness.<//Text>

Came here cuz a family member is being treated and cared for here, so I came to visit. Parking is free in the lot or street. Just be aware during baseball seasons, driving in the area is difficult with lots of traffic. Several small buildings. The hospital is the north side of the lot. Visitors must sign in and wear badge. Nice small garden and a water fountain. Staff is helpful.
There is a nice park nearby to get out for walking around.<//Review>

<Review>Should you or a relative need a respiratory hospital, Barlow is the best place for treatment.  My husband was in the ICU of a local medical center and required a ventilator to breathe.  He needed advance care to help regain use of his lungs and I wanted to be sure he was treated at a facility which had the best possible outcomes.  After much research, I did my darndest to make sure he would be transferred to Barlow and I have not had one second of regret.

My husband was a "hot mess" when he was admitted to Barlow Respiratory Hospital, including bacterial infections and a previously untreated wound, all of which needed to be addressed before his lungs could start their journey back to health.  In short order the infectious disease specialist and wound specialist took care of these setbacks and the respiratory therapists were waiting to start their work.  The staff at Barlow will not give up on a patient - my husband is a quadriplegic (which adds another fly to the ointment) and had a couple of starts and stops in his ventilator "weaning". Each time, the respiratory therapy staff restarted the process and today he is strong enough to breathe 12+ hours per day without the ventilator and increasing every day!!!

In addition to the doctors and respiratory staff, I must send a huge shout out to the nursing staff.  They provide wonderful care to my husband and we are very impressed with their skills and commitment to patient care. Communication in the age of COVID-19 is difficult. I can't be at the hospital asking questions, but the nurses are terrific. When I, or my daughter, call for an update, usually we are able to speak with a nurse immediately.  In the rare instances when my husband's nurse for the day is unavailable at that moment, we always receive a call back in a timely manner.  Always.  Additionally, we are able to speak with my husband during the day and evening via FaceTime  (or WhatsApp for non Apple users). We never feel as if we are interrupting and everyone is courteous, helpful and genuinely pleasant to deal with.  I'm sorry that I do not mention staff by name but I don't want to leave anyone out as all have been phenomenal!!!

My husband also receives occupational and physical therapy.  As I mentioned, he is a quadriplegic.  One day last week I received an unexpected FaceTIme from his p/t. My husband was able to lift his legs a bit (first time on his own!) and the p/t thought my husband might want to FaceTime me to celebrate. Best call ever!

Finally, I would be remiss if I did not send kudos to Bethany, the Social Worker with whom I deal regularly on everything from disability paperwork to my husband's emotions.  She is very accessible and on top of the needs of both the patient and family members. When Bethany sensed I was overwhelmed by my husband's issues, she set up a zoom meeting for my daughter and me so that we could "meet" the staff treating my husband and ask any questions on his status and treatment plan.  When I had additional questions following the meeting, Bethany followed up with the appropriate staff members.  She cares and goes "above and beyond"!

I made the right choice - Barlow Respiratory Hospital is the best!</Review>< Pictures>

My Mom, Gloria, had the good fortune of being at Barlow Hospital not only once but twice!  Both times we were fortunate that she was taken care of by Dr. Nelson and his excellent team.  During her first stay Dr. Nelson made the prudent decision to give her time to wean from the ventilator, and a tracheotomy was avoided.  After another critical illness almost four years later, my Mom was again at Barlow and received the care that she needed to get back on her feet.  Not only was the physical care good but the staff was warm and reassuring.  Dr. Nelson arrived every morning to check on her progress and even combed her hair.  The nurses and aides responded promptly, and there were some that even sang!  The therapists were great too, and many of the staff remembered her from the last time she was there.  A former sanatorium from the days of tuberculosis, the historic buildings are nestled in a lovely valley with gardens, a koi pond and even flocks of parrots flying through.  In an age when large, impersonal hospitals are becoming the norm, Barlow offers high quality medical care in a unique setting, with personal attention and kindness!</Review>

My husband received outstanding care at Barlow he only had a couple of issues with
One assistant that was a little rude and ruff
In the beginning the therapy team went above and beyond wish I could remember everyone's name from me to everyone (Nurses, asst. Nurses, Doctors, cooks security guards,case workers, the whole Barlow staff) I give each person a 5 star review GOD BLESS YOU ALL</Text>< time>

My friend's son is cared for at the Barlow Hospital in Van Nuys. The nurses, doctors, therapist, social worker and the case manager, are all very professional and caring.  The boy is recovering very well.  Very impressive.</review>

< review>
I had to request to transfer my mom to the Van Nuys location, my mom was not well taken care of at the LA location. She developed bed sores from not being turned every 2 hours like she was supposed to. Every day that I came to see her (which was every other day) she was crying saying she was left for too long with no one checking on her for 2-3 hours. My mom is currently paralyzed from the shoulders down, she has no vocals due to her spinal injury from a car accident so she's not able to call out for help when she needed it. I complained every day, they finally moved her room closer to the nurses station. My mom also had roommate who wasn't treated very nicely and we witnessed her being neglected as well until we finally physically called a nurse in to see about her. I would not recommend this location they are way to under staffed or their staff is extremely slow. I wanted to give them a high rating but it is what it is. The one positive thing I can say is that majority of the staff is friendly.</review>

Eventhough this hospital is really small. I love the therapist there. I think they were the best attending my son. The therapists really stand out to me more than nurses. RT Lorena man she was awesome, taking her time to explain about my son's oxygen use. RT Ping Ping- she great, does Xtra, she don't mind & the other team that helped my son walk (feel bad cuz I forgot there names) they do it with love & care. Awesome staff of therapist are the BEST!!!< /review>

<user_name>Sandra Holmbom</user_name><Review>My husband was at Barlow recently and I was very pleased with the Nursing Staff especially the Nursing Assistants. The social worker and our case manager were exceptional. I wasn’t 100 percent pleased with physical therapy, but we weren’t there for PT. The Respiratory Department is efficient and professional. They were always available to us, but I never needed to summon them they were frequently making rounds. I would definitely encourage others needing Respiratory Therapy to go to Barlow.

Thank you to all the staff who provided excellent  service to my husband!

<Text>one of the things i liked about here was the physical therapy they where very attentive with my mom and help her as much as possible she was coming there from a head surgery and she was very much aware and wanted to do things on her own but they would not permited they did not have the time to help her overcome her situation instead she was heavely drug with medicine giving to drug addicts instead of assesing her and seeing what was better for her since she was in recovery mode not icu,  if u have a loved one here check on them everyday mke sure theyvre being chnge , and ask to see whatvtype of drugs are being givinf to them most patients cant speak  so they are not able to say once they are poop or pee and they take for ever to help u when u ask for help or anything .</Text><Rating>1<//Rating>< resp>

That hospital is garbage , I’ve been there visiting my mom and they left her alone for a long time and she had feces on the bed when I arrived , and they never came to check on her and other people I spoke to about there family members they said they do what they want because the patients are so sick they can’t complain but it’s ok because they have family members too and them their self will have to face serious neglect one day ,karma.<//text>

Some of the staff here are genuinely abusive to the patients.  I have 3 witnesses to this behavior.  They are dangerously understaffed, and unsanitary.  They use wash clothes as diapers, and then wash the soiled cloths and use them to wash a patient's face.  I will be reporting them to the state.  I was won over by their glowing reviews.  They hide the bad reviews and they drug their patients with multiple psychoactive drugs in order to keep them from complaining.  It is really a very sad situation.  Many of their patients can't talk because they are on a ventilator.  A nurse told me a lot of the patients are out of it, but now that I see that they handle complaints by drugging their patients I imagine some of them weren't admitted in that state.  The family has no idea what's going on in many cases because the doctors do not communicate medication changes.  I had an outside doctor review my loved one's medication list and they found that the amount of psychoactive drugs being given (especially since there was never any history of needing it prior) was excessive and could cause cognitive damage.  Please spare your loved one this abuse and avoid Barlow at all costs.  If your loved one isn't an easy case they won't see them through the weaning process even though they advertise that they do.  It's all smoke and mirrors.  Not to mention they have a caseworker named Clare who is the most unpleasant, vile human being you've ever met.  She is incredibly rude, and it is all a front for the fact that she does not do her job and if you question her she will insult and degrade you.  She yelled at me for no reason.  Then tried to tell me the three lawyers I spoke with were wrong because she was right.  She provided no other basis or fact other than she is right.  Clare is apparently omnipotent.  The advertising does not match the service nor care you will receive at this facility.  They act as though they care about the family and the struggles of having an ill loved one.  However the behavior of their staff says the opposite.  Especially when dealing with Clare, who I am filing a formal complaint about.  I'll give them 2 stars only because the doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists are actually skilled and kind.<//review>

<review>There is no way I could recommend this place. I ordered the Classic Country Club sandwich and I normally don’t take my food apart, but it was a little thick with ham. When I remove the meat to thin it out a little the cheese had MOLD on it. There was no mistaking that it was mold! How can anyone serve that? If I wouldn’t have removed the meat I would have eaten it. I was so disappointed I didn’t want the same cook to make me another one. Not sure how fresh there food is!</review><Gmap_id>0x80d9535a5c704ea7:0xf375853dc0f09cc4<//Gmap_id><userid>102710295834547467723<//userid>< response>

This restaurant is one of the few open early in the morning with oatmeal.  I stopped by early in the morning after my run and was treated to a poorly cooked bowl of oatmeal and horrible tasting fruit.  In addition, I had a cup of coffee that never seemed to get refilled.  At 6:40 in the morning, I don't think they cared very much.  Overall, 24 dollars was a rip off.  The egg place up the street is also open early and is a much better restaurant in regards to service and oatmeal quality.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Service was ok but the food was not great. Eggs Benedict sauce has strange metallic flavor and there were egg shells in my sauce (not very pleasant). The only syrup they have available is Ms. Butterworth which is not maple syrup (tastes gross). Food is WAY overpriced for the quality.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1617555130740, 'text': 'Thanks for the feedback! See you next time!'}<//resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
We've been coming here for about 7 years now. It's been going down hill especially in the last few years. The hash browns used to be magical! Now they just aren't even good anymore. Came in today for breakfast as we do every time we are in the area and now there's no more breakfast menu! Only a very small brunch menu. Was told by the waitress they only have a brunch menu on weekends. This must be a new thing as we've only ever been here on weekends and have always had the full breakfast menu. At least the Benedict was pretty good. I don't think we'll be coming here again, it just isn't what it used to be. I'm kinda bummed about that.< /review>

We visited this place during spring break. We tried to go to another breakfast spot but was crowded so this is wasn't as busy. The food and service was great. We were staying at the Omni so it was a 5 minute walk there. This is located inside the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel. Highly recommended.</review>

I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel for 5 days and had breakfast at Maryjane's for 3 days out my 5 day stay. The breakfast was great (especially their potatoes and bacon)...however, after eating breakfast there on day 4, I left the restaurant to later return a hour later to drink coffee and do a little computer work, only to be told I could not be seated without ordering food due to the "expected" lunch crowd. I explained that I ate breakfast there a couple of hours earlier and just wanted to sit, drink coffee and work on my laptop for a couple of hours. Being that they have a separated bar area in the resturant and the restaurant and bar were not full in addition to my eatting there earlier, I assumed it would not be a problem. However, the hostess denied me the opportunity to be seated but after I wasn't easily turned away and continued with questions, the hostess decided to ask the manager to speak with me.  The manager, Lily Jones, came over and preceded to give a similar explanation, which was starting to sound a lot like discrimination, being that they could not give me a solid justifiable reason as to why they could not seat me, even if only for an purchased cup of coffee or tea. After going back and forth about the issue with the manager, Lily, she finally decided that it would be ok for me to sit at the bar and work and order coffee. Although, the bartender who attended to me, was extremely kind, attentive and provided amazing customer service, the previous interaction with the hostess and manager made my experience after being seated uncomfortable to the point to where I left shortly after I was seated. With thst being said, I will not return to Maryjane's.</Text>

I have been visiting Maryjane's since they opened.  It has been about a year since my last visit, although pricey the food has always been prepared well, good quality / portions and the staff is great.  I am giving them 3 stars for quality over variety.  Was sad today to find out that many of my favorites are no longer on the menus.  They explained that they pared down their menu for plates that can be prepared quickly for the convention crowds.  I can understand limiting options when large conventions are open but all the time?

Ordered 2 omelettes (with biscuit and potatoes), 1 coffee.  $43.00 before tip.< /Text>

I started off upset because there would be a Hard Rock restaurant in the Hard Rock Hotel but no I found Maryjane's.  They completely made up for my preconceived notions.  They made a great western burger with some great service.<//text>

I really enjoyed the food and the service. However, the biggest thing was there was a huge confusion of some items and the manager took it upon herself to talk to us face to face and resolve it very quickly. Nicole did a great job as the manager to make sure our service was top notch and all confusion was set aside. I would definitely recommend this place because of Nicole's commitment to quality service.<//Review>

I didn't like this place at all. The food is way overpriced for the selection and quality of food they have. I wouldn't go again or recommend to anyone. The only good thing is that is within the hard rock hotel in case you're staying there and don't have any other place to go. I highly recommend walking 10 minutes to Richard Walkers Pancakes for a great breakfast though (it's even cheaper).</Text>

So I gave them 4 stars because they didn't drop the ball like nearly everyone else at the hotel I have dealt with. Overall my experience STAYING at the Hard Rock has been awful! But in this little cafe' I had a pleasant experience - so thank you Maryjane for picking up the slack for the rest of your team members in the hotel.<//text><user>102074929187755317468<//user><response>None<//response><user_name>Jacquelyn Burns</user_name></record></dataset><record>

The food here is ridiculously expensive. Honestly $13 for pancakes is absurd. However... the food is really good for a little diner type place in a hotel. I also had a hamburger and fries. $16 for that. Shockingly expensive. BUT! Really good and more food than I could eat in two sittings. Also, it's not a crowded spot like every other place on the block. I was able to enjoy my food in a laid back atmosphere and then kick back and people watch all the traffic going around the Gaslamp. I enjoyed Maryjane's a lot. I will probably stop back in for another round of ridiculously expensive $13 pancakes the next time I'm in San Diego.<//Text>

I will recommend it because good customer service and knowledgeable employees are hard to find in many businesses nowadays.  If you ask for Breanne you'll get someone who knows her drinks, and customer service. Please give her a raise. Thanks. I'll be back soon.</review>

Was unable to order standard breakfast items off the menu while I was in town because there was a convention. Only had a small menu available and said they couldn't offer the menu listed online.
If you can't handle the flow of business with your typical menu, either shrink it completely and post that one online... Or, maybe don't take up restraunt space you're not equipped to properly serve with consistency.
My order that could not be completed was buscuits and gravy.< /review>

When I explained this was not what I ordered as I have a food aversion to bbq sauce the waitress argued with me insisting i did. She took the plate back wiped some of the bbq sauce off and dumped buffilio sauce on top, as if I would not be aware. The manager noticed the look on my face and finally after an hour of my friend eating alone i was brought a third plate which was finally what i ordered. This was a shameful and embarrassing place to eat. They have no respect for you as a customer and I spend all night wondering why.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< user_id>

<Text>Had not been there before, was downtown for ComicCon and had lunch here. Maybe it was because of ComicCon crowds but prices were very high. $20 for a plain burger with homemade chips! Wanted some BBQ sauce and they wanted $2! Food was okay, but I won't be back.< /Text>< Pics>

Prices were a little high, though we expected that in Hard Rock during Comic-Con. Thankfully the wait was never terrible, 30 minutes at worst, and food was beyond excellent. Best shake i'd had in a long time. Burger was to die for, and breakfast was super filling and well made. I eat here 2/3 times every time I come to SD.<//Text>

Don't assume this is own by HardRock, it is not. Food is expensive and worse burger and Fish n Chips. How do you get the basic food so wrong!
Fish was over fried, dark brown. 2 small strips of 3" long with salty fries for $16.00. Classic Burger has no flavor in the meat, the center of the meat was still COLD, uncooked; while the outside is burned. I had to refer a group of 15 to go down to Burger Lounge, instead.</text>

There taste was really lacking. I'm disappointed in the dry salmon, the bland quinoa omelet breakfast and the terrible fish and chips. Although I gave tips in all the occasions the servers never bothered to explain what they have served they just dumped it and left. I'm sorry but you only get 3 stars for the looks of the food. I'm not even talking price now. From Hard Rock hotel I was supposed to get 20% off and only got 10% in one occasion, how strange is that even when I got the servers. So to sum it up,  it's actually 1 star too much to be honest.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Food is good but overpriced. There are plenty of other great options around that area given you are downtown. Hard Rock guests get free coffee in the morning so might be worth checking out that place.<//text>

<Text>While taking lunch from working at Comic-Con we crossed the street to eat at the themed SyFy Cafe. Open tables were everywhere, yet we were forced to wait 10 minutes of out of our lunch time to get a table out on the patio with no shade.

It took another 10 minutes for the waitress (Abbott the Rabbit)  to come acknowledge us, so we informed her we were in a hurry and ordered food with our drinks.

When the food came it was pretty much correct, I had ordered well done and it was medium-well, but I can deal with that. we were sharing the $19 bacon cheeseburger. We asked for BBQ sauce for the burger and some ranch for the fries. We were in a hurry to get back to work and know the mess crossing the street so we started eating... we saw our waitress casually attending to other tables for several minutes and we were almost finished when another server finally brought out the BBQ and Ranch. I never even had the opportunity to try the BBQ on my burger before finishing it...

When the bill came the charges were...

$19 Cardioburger
$2   Split Plate
$1   BBQ Sauce
$.50 Ranch
$1.97 Tax

Total $24.47 for a burger and fries.... so grand total with tax and tip... $24.47 as I didn't have time to argue with the waitress over these charges I simply let her pay for them with her deserved gratuity.

Easily the most expensive yet mediocre burger I have ever had.< /Text>< pics>

Average food, good service. It's attached to the Hard Rock property. Simple breakfast options, a bit over priced.</Text>

Service was terrible, food was ok, prices were ridiculous. They all seem to think that since they work at the "Hard Rock" they are all cool. Good grief, mello out and provide some service. I will not be back. Don't waste your time or money.< /review>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Worst food I've ever had, I got the tacos and it tasted like water. They gave my friend some one else's food that they already took a bite out of and then tried to charge her for it. My other friend ordered a sandwich and all they gave her was bacon on bread. The steak that was ordered was cooked on the sun which is why it came out so well done and late. There were pieces of eggs in the Mac and cheese burger. You have to sell your organs/ soul on the black market to afford a soda. When problems were brought to the managers attention, the manager fixed the mistake on the bills but there was no apology given.

BUT, 10/10 would recommend the guac and chips.< /review>< Time>

< review>
The moment I walked in I was greeted by a friendly younger woman with dark hair, dark makeup and tattoos -- think the friendliest goth kid from high school. I took a seat the bar and she gave me a menu. So far, so good.

Then, the waiting. I asked twice for coffee (first to the hostess, and then to the bartender) and it took an excruciating 5? 10? minutes for me to get a cup of joe. My hope, and frankly, my expectation is that coffee at the bar in a breakfast place should be reflexive. Not the case here.

Then, the food. God, the food was terrible. I got the cake and eggs: pancakes from batter in a box, cheapest sausage links I've had since summer camp (and cold), and worst of all -- WORST OF ALL -- Mrs. Butterworth's. Are you f****** kidding me? This is not even maple syrup, this is just "syrup." Chris Rock can tell you what that's for, and isn't pancakes.

So, the staff was lovely and saved whatever semblance of a breakfast experience this was going to be. The food was offensive and I'll never be back.< /review>

I just walked in this morning for breakfast and waited about 10 minutes before leaving. The young lady at the bar didnt once acknowledge our existence. After a couple of minutes a couple walked in and sat next to us. She approached them and walked passed us twice, to get and bring them there drink order. She than went to the gentlemen who where before us on the opposite side and finised taking their order. Lastly a couple walked in behind us and she greeted them with a warm welcome. Im just confused as to why we wernt ever acknowledged and looked over SO MANY times. Needless to say, we walked out after that and i would hope it wasnt because we were black.< /Review>

Good, no... Great food and a fun atmosphere, but feels a little like a tourist trap and it's priced accordingly.< /Text>

Ordered the short rib grilled cheese and it was almost inedible - the bread was soggy and the au jus they served with it was like a flavorless gravy instead of au jus. The meat was pretty flavorless, too and I couldn't taste the cheese at all. Our server was the manager and he was far more interested in his basketball bracket than he was anything else.</Review>

(Translated by Google) We arrived on Thanksgiving an hour before closing time.
It took a long time before we could order as we were forgotten in their eagerness to get ready for the next day.
The food was mediocre and not fantastic. My medium steak in the user was stone hard.
However, the place is airy and the food arrived in reasonable time after we arrived. Not a place I will come again.
However, the 3 stars are given in the understanding that it was a special day

(Original)
Vi kom på thanksgiven en time før lukketid.
Det tog lang tid før vi kunne bestille da vi blev glemt i deres iver på at gøre klar til næste dag.
Maden var middelmådig og ikke fantastisk. Min medium bøf i brugeren var sten hård.
Stedet er dog luftigt og maden kom i rimelig tid efter vi ankom. Ikke et sted jeg kommer igen.
De 3 stjerner er dog givet i forståelse for at det var en særlig dag<//text>

The designers/decorators/bakers at Frosted Cakery are outstanding!
I am in the Chicago area and wanted to send a festive "tacky Hawaiian" themed birthday cake to family who live in Fresno. Not having a perfect idea of how I wanted the cake to look, I emailed several ideas to the designers. They blended my ideas into a perfect creation! It not only looked FANTASTIC but tasted incredible too. I HIGHLY recommend this bakery and will be using them again myself should I never need another themed cake in the Fresno area .</Text>

<Text>I’ve had a birthday cake from here along with cupcakes and cookies on several occasions. I’ve given it many opportunities but the cakes and cupcakes are just not that good. Visually, they look cute but they’re usually very dry and way too sweet. On the last couple of occasions I’ve visited this store, the people helping me at the front have been so rude as well. They’re always rushing me and staring me down as if they want me to hurry up and leave. It’s such an ugly feeling. I’ve given up and I won’t be back.</Text>< pics>

I ordered cake yesterday at the last minute for my wife’s (harman) birthday. And they promised to make it fresh and deliver on time. And they as promised. Cake was so beautiful and fresh and tasted so delicious. And it was delivered on time. Thank you so much for your help. Will order more.< /review>

< review>
Real Compassion & understanding are vital during this pandemic.  There are no words to describe the pain one suffers after losing a family member and being unable to be with those suffering most.  I'm in Florida and my daughter & son-in-law are in Fresno. They just lost their unborn daughter of 7 months. My husband & I both fall into vulnerable categories and are unable to travel and be there to bring personal comfort to them or even attend the funeral.  To say that this is traumatic is an understatement.

After hearing my situation, Frosted Cakery was extremely compassionate and very much  "in tune" when I called in my order.  I wanted a to send a nice care package of baked goodies to hopefully brighten their day a little. Frosted Cakery tailored my order exactly (by sending me pics for approval, choices,  etc.,)   Thank you for "being there" when we couldn't be and also for "personally" delivering the order. Beautiful treats and they loved them!</review>

<Review>I worked with Frosted Cakery as they were recommended to me by local friends and family.  I got a custom two tired cake designed all via email, which as a very pleasant experience.  Someone always followed up with me and responded to any questions or concerns I had.  The staff is amazing.

I was so excited to pic up my cake on the day of my Grandpa's 100th Birthday and I'm not going to lie, when I saw the cake, I was kind of disappointed.

The writing on the cake was in chinese and they made it out of fondant and painted it gold, but they make it with multiple pieces and put it together rather than stenciled out one whole piece, so when they painted it in gold, you could see the cracks of where they put it together.  When I pointed it out at pick up, she told me what she did to make it and I completely understand that, but she was basically like, well that's all we can do.

The cake was over $300 and I was just disappointed.  So while it was very nice working with them to design the cake, the execution wasn't exactly what I expected.< /Review>< user>

I ordered a cake for my son’s first birthday and I can not even begin to describe how delicious the cake was. The fondant was delicious!!! That’s all we kept talking about because I have never been able to say that fondant was delicious. The cake was so perfectly designed and just beautiful. Many conpliments. Thank you for helping us make his first birthday special.< /review>

< review>
I threw a surprise party for my Mom`s 50th birthday and decided to have a cake made. After visiting a couple other cake places in town, I decided on Frosted Cakery. I had some photos I found online and they drew up a sketch for the cake. Flavors? Keylime cake with raspberry filling. The cake was a hit at the party and my mom loved it. Photo is poor, but cake looked beautiful and tasted like summer.< /review>

Went to a consultation for my wedding cake. We ordered a medium, three tiered wedding cake that’s supposed to feed 40 people and 4 dozen cupcakes for $670, including $50 delivery service and non-optional cupcake towers. My husband and I felt awkward and unwanted as the owner ranted to my mom about “our generation”. She never once gave my husband the option to speak about his thoughts on the cake and dismissed whatever he said by directing the conversation back to me.  According to the layout and design of the cake, it was supposed to have what looks like a molten gold river made out of gold leaf, barley frosted, with fake succulents on the middle tier. Instead we got a small, poorly put together cake that barley fed 25. The gold leaf looked like it had been slapped on at the last minute with thicker frosting than needed. The cake and cupcakes tasted very dry and overly sweet, definitely not worth what it cost. 2/5 wouldn’t recommend.</Text>

< review>
This was my first time ordering with Frosted  Cakery, I’ve had their cupcakes before when my friend ordered them for an event I had.. My daughter was turning 5 and I decided to order her cupcakes the Sundae Cupcake.. I’m a teacher and had 4 zoom meetings and wasn’t able to leave my house, so I ordered on Door  Dash.. The delivery person delivered to the wrong house and then brought them to me after, I told her “wrong house” she blamed her GPS.  My son Received the order and quickly hid them from my daughter. After my zoom meetings my son said mom the box looks dirty, I look at the box and there is frosting fingerprints all over 2 cupcakes missing and another 2 cupcakes had what looked like a finger gouged them.. I called Door Dash who wanted to credit me $9.00.. that was the cost of the 2 cupcakes. That didn’t even cover the $8.00 dollar tip or service fee.. I called Frosted Cakery to warn them about my dasher delivery..and Suggest taping the boxes so we can tell if it’s been tampered with .. Emily answered and was amazing she talked to her boss and both were very apologetic and did everything to save the day.. Replaced my order and even delivered it to me.. I can’t Thank You guys enough..I Truly appreciate it.<//review>

The shop is small, a bit sterile, and it isn't located in the best of districts but they did have some really pretty cakes sitting out as decorations. The actual cupcake selection was pretty good and I ordered 5 all together. Out of the 5, only 2 really stood out as being good and the others were just okay. Now, to be fair, the ones that were good were very very good (honey butter and lemon) but overall I just wasn't super impressed. Maybe I will give them another try sometime but I'm in no rush... which is saying a lot because I love cupcakes. Ha< /text>< Time>

Service, however, was pretty amazing. While I don't think I will be back, I believe that some people might find this place quite interesting. For all you who really like sugary sweets, check it out!<//review>< Time>

<Text>I truly cannot say enough good things about Beverly and her staff at Frosted Cakery! From our initial meeting all the way through our wedding day, everything flowed smoothly and I never had to worry about a thing. We chose a small 6" cake (for us to cut) and an assortment of cupcakes for our guests (Salted Caramel, Red Velvet, Vanilla Bean Raspberry) and everything was pretty much perfect.
On the day of our wedding, our cake and cupcakes were delivered and set up right on time, they matched the coral color I was wanting perfectly on our cake and the cupcakes were definitely one of the big hits of the evening. Thank you Beverly and everyone at Frosted for making our wedding so sweet! We will definitely be using Frosted for our next big celebration!</Text>< pictures>

We at Frosted do like to pile high the frosting, we are all about the frosting over here ;) We see you tried our Sundae cupcake, which is definitely for those who love the extra buttercream because that one has a higher ratio of buttercream to cake, so you better love a lot of frosting if you choose that flavor. We do offer buttercreams that are less sweet as well as some flavors that have very little. With all that to say, we hope we will be seeing you again soon and would love to direct you towards the cupcakes that may better fit your taste buds and preferences!

Absolutely loved the cupcakes , cooks and rice crispy pops. They decorated them according to pictures I sent them. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the perfection in their work, and when I took a bite, it was as if time stood still; seriously. They have a new customer for life.<//Review>

<Review>The best tasting and most artistic 'cake' art ever; cupcakes, wedding cakes and custom cakes.  Whatever you're looking for, they were very helpful designing a custom cake for our event.  My daughters used them for their wedding cakes as well and they were not only amazing pieces of artwork, they tasted fantastic too. Best bakery around - try it out.< /Review><date>1495131741170< /date>< pictures>

I work with Frosted Cakery very often through my job, so naturally I used them to create the wedding cake for my wedding. Not only did the sketch up the thoughts in my head to perfection, but their execution was above and beyond what I could have dreamed for our trio of cakes. I even enjoyed the Red Velvet cake which is my least favorite and my husbands choice. Just proof that anything from Frosted is not only pretty but tastes heavenly!<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_name>

Read a lot of good review about this place so I wanted to give it a try so I place an order online and they reply back. So I had to call in and ask what is the status of the order 2 times just to find out they are book that day. Should of order my cake at a more reliable place.<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Planning a wedding?! FORGET IT!!!! They cancelled on our consultation on the day of the appointment twice! it cause us 2 vacation days already without even meeting them! and have the nerve to laugh at us after they said "we'll we couldn't control a persons health"  and the guy that i spoke to didn't even apologize for their fault. Think twice before hiring them for your big day! they might cancel on the day of your wedding too!!!!

I gave them 1 star because there's no ZERO STAR option!!!!
THEY ARE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!< /Text>< Name>

Best wedding cakes and custom cakes on the planet! Cupcakes, strawberry pizzas, single pies, French macaroons they are all the best in the area by far.  Definitely a place to check out - 1 block South of the Tower Theater in Tower District.< /Review>

< Review>
My only complaint is that my days off are their closed days! Their cupcakes are my favorite in town—and I've tried a lot of different shops throughout Clovis and Fresno. The buttercream is top notch, and I'm super picky when it comes to the perfect tasting icing. Cake shakes are great, too! Customer service is friendly.<//Review>

Horrible availability schedule for consultations. Tuesday's and Wednesday ONLY- don't bother asking for a special day or time because they WILL NOT accommodate you. Save your time & money, call any place but them. Their cakes and cupcakes are mediocre as well, nothing that your neighbor or talented & creative fried can't whip up with some notice.

If there was a way to rate this company with 0 stars I would have!<//review>

<Text>Just canceled my "custom" order with this bakery. My initial consultation seemed great, until I researched comparison of their "signature cakes" and realized I was being charged significantly more, for something less elaborate than the signature cakes. After sitting down with the head baker, I was dissatisfied with the actual service. She had a very entitled attitude and projected an extremely condescending tone towards me. I was more than corporative and she chose to use her preconceived notion  to lead in our consultation. I will never do business with this company as the climate of this situation seems to be echoed throughout this bakery. Also, she did not seem particularly satisfied to assist based on my variant of culture.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The cookies and cream cupcake had cream cheese filling and it's probably the best cupcake I've ever had. And the cinnamon sugar buttercream frosting on the snickerdoodle one was magical.

Orderd 1 dozen of coustome made beauty beast cookies paid $54 very disappointed their pictures are nice on fb but when I picked up the cookies very poor  And not what I described i wanted I feel for the price I paid they would be a little cute Don't recommend and won't order from this shop again I feel if you get a picture from a coustomer you should do exactly what is on the pic just saying ladies if your going to order cookies just order from someone who specialize in just cookies<//Review>

Well, they never showed up so one of their assistant bakers did their best to take my order.  The caked decorators were supposed to call me but instead had another assistant bake call me to relay a message about the price for he cake I wanted.  To make a long story short, I tried several times to get in touch with the main person who was going to be making my cake but all I got was the run around and messages from middle men.  In the end, I canceled my cake order and used the $100 down payment I had already given them to order cake pops which were awful.  Starbucks has better cake pops and cheaper.  I feel like if you're not one of their customers ordering an $1000 plus, cake, they aren't going to give you the time of day.< /review>

It came out fab, plus since it was a 2 tier it had to flavors. I'm not a big fan of caramel but man the salted caramel is delicious. Lots of options.  The lady we met was super nice & we where able to try lots of flavors. If u have a budget they draw a draft to show what you like & around how much it wouls cost. Wish i remember her name. Wish the prices where a little less. But overall awsome place- so recommended:)< /text>< Gmap_id>

HORRIBLE AND PREJUDICE!!!. I go in for a wedding cake consultation. I ask for a particular design from an image to be done on a cake. She asked for my budget i said i really didn't have one, she said its going to be really really  expensive and that she cant give me a price for me to know thats that cake will be really really expensive. I asked about 7 times in 2 minutes about how much. She would even give me a ball park price what is the point of a consultation!!!!so we just walked out i have never felt so judged before in my life. I felt like she thought i couldnt afford a nice expensive cake. Im a 25yr old mexican and make 80k+ a yr. Just because i dont dress like i have money doesnt mean that i dont. I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!<//text>

<time>1604445519580</time><Resp>None< /Resp><review>This was the worse haircut that we had to pay $40 for!! I usually cut my husband’s hair and it’s 💯 better than what she did.
She saw a picture and didn’t even bother to match, she just cut the sides like it’s something we need a specialist to do!! Didn’t even bother to use scissors to match the hair length as you can see in the picture, then made a big hole on the right side that we don’t know how we can hide it.
After 6 month waiting she spent only 10 minutes to ruin the wait. DON’T waste your money for bad hair cut you can get it for free at home</review></record></dataset><record>

Best hair cut I have ever had. My stylist Casey was very professional and took good care of me. She captured the look I was going for perfectly. Topped off with a shampoo and a neck shave she left me feeling like a trillion dollar bill. I will be going back for her great service. Good to get a cut from somewhere other than supercuts and leave feeling special. Ask for Casey shes awesome.< /review>

I gave them a shot because I couldn’t get in to see my normal girl and I had an event that I had to go to. Nice enough place but $40+ for a quick clippers cut wasn’t what I expected, she didn’t even touch the scissors. I understand my hair type is unusual in the suburbs (course curly hair) but there wasn’t too much attention paid to evening it out. The razor on the back of the neck is a nice touch but she stretched out my shirt to where it’s unwearable any longer. Again nice enough people and I’m glad they got me in but I won’t be going back.</Text>

<Review>After using competitor’s services for some time and being happy with it, I decided to give this place a try. As my first time, I was not disappointed. I was welcomed warmly with an offering of a drink until the stylist was ready. I went in for a haircut and a beard trim and loved the knowledge and proactiveness of Kseniya as to what I wanted and her ability to relate. Very pleased with how it all turned out and ended up buying some beard care products from them as well! I will go again the next time.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Asked for line up and she made it a big deal. Like we don't do lines ups here. Well your not a barber then.

Update: I came back to this barbershop giving it a second chance as it's really close to my work and right before Valentine's day. I asked the stylist if she has her barbers license she nodded. When I asked to get a lineup she said she couldn't because she's not a barber. I had to jump to a second chair with a different stylist to line me up. Also the first stylist dint know the different between a tapper and a fade. And did not know how to round out my side burns

Friendly staff, easy to schedule a same day appointment and very nice storefront.  Price for basic hair cut was pretty high. Not sure I'll go back when there are so many other options in the area.< /Text>

Have been getting my haircut with Roosters for 3 years now, and it’s a great cut every time. Sean has been cutting mine since March and does an amazing job, and an all around great dude to kick it with while I’m there. Definitely recommend Sean if you’re looking for a new barber.

Shoutout to my boy Kyle who cut my hair for like 2 years and has since gone on to make big moves for his family.</Text>

Roosters is 100% the Place to Go!!! I came here after a stressful day and I had an INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE. I had seen many great reviews on the place and on the Barber / Stylist named MATT. So I decided to check it out and book MATT for an appointment. Everything that the reviews said were absolutely true! He did an AMAZING job cutting my hair, listening to every aspect of what I wanted for my hair. It was really nice to come to Roosters and be TREATED SO GREATLY! Even though I booked MATT, I inspected the other Barbers / Stylists and all the other many guest that came in. Every single one left with an ABSOLUTELY GREAT hair cut.! I will be back in a month, book MATT again and tell so many about him and Roosters. I 100% recommend you going to Roosters!!!</Text>

Nice relaxing atmosphere. Price is a bit higher than a "Sport clips", but you get what you pay for. The extra attention and quality is nice and worth it. They have a devoted following and so they book up quickly which leaves little opportunity for walk ins. It takes a bit of planning ahead.< /Review>

<response>None</response><text>As mentioned in another review, cut it with the "we are a 5 star restaurant and we are too good for first timers" act. This is a business and it seems to be running higher than everyone else. All businesses should be welcoming to potential future clients.(i.e. "How does booking an appointment for tomorrow or another day sound" if no appointments are a available) I'm looking for a new biweekly barbershop (old one closed down) so I decided to come in here and it was the most unwelcoming business I've been in. Very much did not seem like they wanted new business. Will not be giving business to Roosters. I'll keep looking for a barber shop..<//text>< user_name>

This place is basically an overpriced Great Clips with nice decor. When you're charged $33 for your son's haircut (instead of $23), don't expect anyone there to be able to help you. Apparently the manager is the only one who can fix that, but when he's not in, you're out of luck. This is robbery.</review>

A little expensive but Whitney is amazing, and very talented. If you want a real MAN's haircut and not just a hack job like you get a Supercuts or Great Clips, then you must try them out. Sharp single razor neck line trim that will last three times longer then a normal electric trimmer, along with warm shave cream and hot face towel....to top it off they also give you a great head massage while shampooing your hair!< /text>

I wanted a nice hair cut. I thought the old adage was true...you get what you pay for. Not true here! They charge for a Cadillac hair cut and you walk out with a Paul Blanco bad credit Hyundai. I had to go home and fix it after having the lady try twice to fade it correctly. If I have to pull out my clippers after, you won't be seeing me or get my referrals ever.< /text>

My son Milan was scheduled for 5:30 appointment with stylist Alison on Oct 5, 2016, however as we walked in, we were eventually informed that Alison waited for us and left and that Rooster's policy is to wait 5-7 min for a customer. We were only 4 minutes late, not even 5 or 7!
Another gentleman came in, who was very late at this point, but he was prompted to the chair by a receptionist/stylist that happen to be there waiting for a very late customer, but our stylist decided not to wait only 4 minutes.
I'm very disappointed how the business was run.< /text>

Pretty good for the area. They give you a little more than you expect but not close to the male salons of LA or NYC, this is NOT the old school barber experience but many steps up from Supercuts, Great Clips and the rest of the 20 dollar fare. The staff is nice and know what they are doing but they do have a few stylists that need a bit more training. Had many cuts here and been great for the most part which is why I continue to come here. It's taken me a minute to figure who is best here but this knowledge guarantees a great cut. One last thing, this placed is always booked, especially on weekends so get to app or call to book an appt or you will not get in. I gave it 4 stars for the lesser skilled stylists and because the experience could still step it up (A full time receptionist, coffee/mocha options, etc) but it's been the most consistent in the Roseville area and still a better value than other salons in the area.</Review>

Gave me a great deal I think they know how hard it is to part with an instrument sometime and they were nice and not like guitar center reps. They invited to come back and play it.  Made a really hard thing a lot easier.</review>

<Review>Good shop, visitors need to ask for knowledgeable help and wait for it.  Not in same league as Sylvan for vintage/collectable, but got a GREAT deal on a blond 2006 ES175D OHSC case queen.  Shop setup was spot on, threw in strings and strap. Bring cash and dont blink.<//Review><date>1607886979915<//date>< user_name>

Great used and new items. They buy instruments that are in reasonable condition. They do not do trade ins but if they buy something from you, you can use the cash towards something else. Very nice staff and a great environment.< /Text>

<Review>Great music store in santa Cruz. The staff are usually very helpful and glad to answer questions. They have a large selection of electric, acoustic, and bass guitars. They also have ukuleles, amps, and other electrics. I think they even have drum stuff. Either way, it's worth a visit if your in the market or need a part for your musical instrument. The prices seem pretty good.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1571688540192, 'text': 'Thanks Lance!'}</response><gmapID>0x808e403b9e8d7b8d:0xf0daee7f72154793< /gmapID></record>

<review>With a wide range of experience each employee brings their own taste and opinions which are great for learning more about the products they have and also how to be a better musician. I miss the old location that seemed larger and had more unusual and odd stuff, but the service is excellent and when I am in a bind they always seem to be able to get me out of it.<//review><GmapID>0x808e403b9e8d7b8d:0xf0daee7f72154793</GmapID>< Response>

My friend brought his guitar in for new strings, and because he has poor eyesight, he asked for assistance in restringing. Though there were quite a few customers needing assistance, my friend was told they'd have it done within about 40 minutes. We browsed a few other stores and came back in 30 minutes, delighted to discover his guitar was ready -- for about $30.</text>

Been coming here since I was a kid and they were on ocean street, bought and sold several instruments through them, and it's always been a positive experience. The employees are more than willing to help you find what you need and are very encouraging to beginners. Plus there's always funky instruments in there that are fun to mess around with. This store just has a great vibe.</Review>

Great selection of musical instruments from their mainstay used guitars to school band instruments.  They'll order stuff they don't have, but they have the best selection in cheap but good used guitars and other modern musical instruments.  We've bought and sold guitars, amps, pedals, mics, cables, and rack equipment.  It's always fun to tool around and see what's in stock or read the wall covered with upcoming gig posters.  They were great on Ocean, now they're down on Pacific, the heart of town, so parking is limited unless you're willing to pay.  And that's okay!<//Text>

<text>Mostly my friend liked it and they seem to have a big collection of guitars and amplifiers of all kinds, some I have not seen before.
Also an isolated room where you can sit and play the guitars you found.

They do have a weird bag policy where you can't go around with a bag in the shop so they request that you leave the bag behind the counter. Just put cameras in the shop to avoid this...< /text>< Pictures>

<text>This is the greatest music store. Although most guitars are lower end,they also have the Lowest prices for a few high end guitars.There are real pearls to be found by a buyer who knows their Gibson,Fender ,and Taylor guitars.There won't be many of them,but I got lucky with each one of those names.The staff couldn't be more helpful. What a fun place to visit ,if you enjoy playing guitar music.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808e403b9e8d7b8d:0xf0daee7f72154793<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Not so starving anymore. Welcome to Guitar Center II, complete with attitude and disdain. Wonder what the owner is starving from? Sales people who want to be there,and not looking at the clock wishing for you,it , and a late sale to all go away.

Good selection, good prices, the only catch--and you might like this kind of thing--is that there were so many people in there trying out instruments that you could hardly hear.<//review>

I am the Pastor of our church in Freedom, we had a couple of issues having to buy electric guitar cords over and over. I talked to Stretch (who by the way is the man!) and he recommended a cord that has a lifetime warranty. We have been using them ever since and havnt had any problems. Any microphones, drum heads, piano's, drum sticks, ........ect. We will be going to Starving Musician for all our future needs. BTW, all the employees were great as well.</Review>

Never again, Santa Cruz .
Since the new location attitude is all you get.
They knew clearly my purchase history and would not do business.

There are some good deals on used gear to found here. But NEVER give them anything to fix, as you might not see it again for half a year.</text>

Honestly, if you're a starving artist, you are not welcome here. The staff makes it very clear that they don't care about the artists at all. I wouldn't recommended this place to my worst enemy.</Text>

<user>109011699302249023791< /user><review>Little by Little is a true hidden gem at the Warm Springs district in Fremont, CA, close to where T4 is. They are tucked away in the corner of the shopping center and this place serves really delicious food! They currently only do to go orders only and all the staff members do their very best to maintain covid safety procedures. They do fusions of every cuisines and serve from pastas, sandwiches, rice plates, and sides. I really enjoyed their food so much that I 100% truly recommend the most! I got to try their vegetarian options which were the roasted garlic cauliflower truffle Mac and cheese, the rainbow salad, and mushroom coconut pesto curry.

I will review the roasted garlic cauliflower truffle Mac and cheese first! It was absolutely my favorite dish on the menu! The presentation of the Mac and cheese was beautiful with the breadcrumbs on top and the chives to give it a nice color. Literally I haven’t had Mac and cheese in so long and this brings back many memories but I liked this version MUCH BETTER! I love the addition of the truffle oil because I think it gave a nice fattiness to the dish but it wasn’t drenched in oil which that’s a good thing. The breadcrumbs gave the Mac and cheese great texture and I love the dish having some garlic as well. I actually do wish that the Mac and cheese was cheesier because Mac and cheese is supposed to be a cheesy dish and for me, I personally wanted more cheese not only to make a viral tik tok video but taste wise, I would have liked and tasted more cheese. I also didn’t see a lot of cauliflower unless it was cut up small which I appreciate so you don’t get huge chunks but I didn’t  taste cauliflower. Overall, my favorite dish on the menu hands down, I really recommend the Mac and cheese!

The rainbow salad is basically kale, baby spinach, red quinoa, cherry tomatoes, red cabbage, roasted white corn, crispy quinoa, with yuzu aioli, and gribiche sauce on the side. This was truly a rainbow salad! I saw a lot of color and the presentation of the salad was beautifully done! You get the freshness of the kale, spinach and love all the vegetables and fruits in the salad as well! The nuttiness of the quinoa was delicious which added a nice flavor aspect to the salad. On the dressing, I’m questioning why I got two dressings because normally  we would only see one dressing so the dressings don’t clash. I wish I only got one dressing instead of two different dressings but both of them tasted about the same in terms of flavor. If I were to choose, I feel like the yuzu aioli was better in terms of flavor and thickness. I thought the gribiche sauce was too thick for me but the yuzu aioli felt lighter; still a but thick but tasted better in my opinion.

The mushroom coconut pesto curry has button mushrooms, red quinoas, cauliflower, corn, and garlic rice. I loved the flavor of the coconut curry. I thought it was creamy, smooth, light, and it was mild. I also love the addition to the quinoa because that added flavor and texture. The mushrooms, I love too and that is like a substitute for meat so the seasoning was on point and definitely was fulling to eat. With the cauliflower, again I didn’t get a lot of cauliflower. I wish there was more and I wish the rice had more garlic because I didn’t get a lot of garlic. Overall, I’m super satisfied with this curry and loved all the elements of the curry!

Overall, Little by Little in Fremont is a true hidden gem in Fremont! I really recommend it and please support this business! They have put a lot of heart and soul to the food and the chef was great in putting everything together to make the dish perfect!<//review><user_name>Jupiter Devours- Maelynn Le< /user_name><date>1614538664391<//date>< resp>

What a hidden gem in Warm Springs. I have passed by this place for so many times without notice it.

We decided to give it a try on a beautiful weekend. Small restaurant but completely filled up on Saturday noon.

The food here is so delicious and the drinks are cute too.

Order:
Roast Bone Marrow: Personally I love the bone marrow a lot, and the sauce on the side is phenomenal.
Seared Scallops: the seared scallops are spot on, and love the creative side of shrimp chili oil.
Confit duck leg: Love the harmony of crispy duck skin and the tender duck meat!

Drinks:
Rose lemonade is delicious!

Thanks for the complimentary spiced popcorn and definitely come back next time to explore more options.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>2nd visit here. Tasty foods with good presentation. You can feel that each dish placed on the table is the result of a thoughtful process. They make their own pasta. It's delicious. Icecream cone on cold brewed coffee is hidden gem. The table next to us soon ordered it, too.< /text>< Pictures>

Great flavors and menu variety. Really appreciate that our teenagers and all adults we're satisfied with the offerings. Tad disappointed that there wasn't a full bar as advertised on their website. If you have more than two people I'd recommend making a reservation. Place has a good vibe, fun music and great service. Waiter was attentive and accomodations made for food allergies with confidence. HIGHLY recommend checking this place out!< /text></record>

Great spot to grab a bite. Particularly loved the steak. Duck confit was almost fall off the bone! Tacos could use more sauce. Also noticed it's the same sauce for a couple dishes. Scallops were delicious. Would have preferred diff sauce for diff dishes... otherwise everything was really good!< /text>

<text>First time in and ordered the house salad, bolognese pasta, pork belly tacos and steak. Everything was delicious and my only critique was the bitter green peppers were used all dishes but the pasta. Their bitterness was not balanced well and were a bit overpowering for my taste. I tossed the flour tortillas from the tacos, and ate the contents over a bed of their side of rice. The rice was fluffy and cooked to perfection.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

Super weird location but pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. All of the farm to table dishes were fantastic. This place has a great chef - that's for sure. The surprising dish was the chuck steak. By the looks of it, one would guess it was overcooked and dry - but really is tender and full of flavor. The pasta for the pappadelle taste like they hand made it; very fresh. Only complaint would be lighting was a tad bit on the bright side - I feel like they could do okay with being 30% less lumen.< /review>

<text>Great  little restaurant just off Mission Blvd at Warm Springs. The chef owner puts a lot of thought and care into his menu and food. Fresh ingredients, excellent flavors,  great specialty cocktails, and good selection of tasty wine and beers. Short ribs are to die for, even the burger was tasty. Bone marrow, nachos and salad starters were also hits. Try it!< /text><UserId.>117575509631638037172</UserId.><Time>1536861870802<//Time></record>

PROS:
- Tasty food.

CONS:
- Super small portions.
- Pricey.

NOTES:
Maybe you're supposed to order multiple portions at this place? I went for lunch and was still hungry after one plate. For the price though, I'm not ordering more than one plate. I ended up visiting another restaurant after. LOL!</text>

<text>Really good food here. The little neck clams along with the short ribs were my favorite dishes of the night. Nice decor and the service was good. It's a little hard to find at first. As you come into the plaza go to the left and make like you are going to go to the back of the marina plaza. It's the last one in that row.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>This is really a fusion tapas kind of place. Food is almost there, but maybe when I went it was chefs night off. The menu is inspiring, it is clean and reasonable, but the food was just not up to expectations. However, still worth a visit if you are looking  for somewhere in Fremont to dine..<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808fc65b8df00001:0xc5005cf459a6b782< /Gmap_id><Name>Nigel Holehouse< /Name><Rating>3< /Rating>< time>

It's about time Fremont gains a new restaurant with class.

The core cuisine is American & French tapas. The menu is subject to change and it's been suggested that foie gras might be served in the future.

The most notable items I had here was the bone marrow, short rib, and uni pasta.

The bone marrow is served with some bread and it's basically a pate. Very rich and flavorful, would be a great choice if you're looking for brunch.

The short rib's presentation is lovely, like a meadow encircled by a dark forest. The meat just falls apart with a slight push of the fork. The garnish adds a complexity to the meat's succulent texture and a small bite of the salad followed by the meat helps balance the flavors. It is by far my favorite dish as it is both a feast for the eyes and the mouth.

The uni pasta here is sure to convince anyone apprehensive of trying uni. The uni itself turns the dish practically into macaroni and cheese, but it doesn't have the smell or heaviness of cheese. The uni is light and custardy and goes great with the roe on top of the pasta. It almost tastes like a comfort food, but has the flavors of the sea incorporated into it. Definitely recommended.

Will come back soon to see how the menu evolves.</Text>

<review>I came here for date night on a Friday evening without a reservation. I've learned that I should make a reservation next time in order to secure one of the few tables.

I ended up sitting by the bar which is not bad in any way as you get a good view on the kitchen and can see how everything is being prepared. I observed how the chef takes great pride in finishing off every dish before he sends it out and is focused on quality and a consistent experience.

Having that said, the dishes do look pretty and very presentable. I tried 4 dishes, plus desert and every dish was worth a photo. The first one I had was the Octopus dish. It's supposed to be a shareable dish, but the portion is still rather small and you only get a few bites of Octopus. All of that is fine in general, the issue is the prize. You pay over $20 for that dish and if you want to feed two people well, you need to order at least three more dishes - if not even four more. This means you will end up paying between $100-170 including drinks. I am ok to pay this kind of money for a nice dinner, but I expect the right service and taste then. Let me elaborate on this.

All dishes I had tasted solid, but there was nothing that really blew me away. Some dishes, like the Risotto are a great idea, but the flavor is not yet there where it needs to be. It felt too salty to me and too soft. I think it's a matter of time and the chef will turn this into a great dish.

Similar with the bone marrow. It's something that you don't eat every day and it was certainly well cooked. But it was missing that certain something that makes me want to end up spending so much money on it. For example, it comes with basic toast which feels just very boring.

The short ribs were solid as well, but not tender and juicy enough for the prize.

Again, there's nothing wrong with the food, but I think the chef just needs some time to refine and work on the recipes to justify the high charge.

The service was so-so. I've ordered a glass of the Cabernet from Passo Robles. One of my favorite wine regions and the red did not disappoint. But: they charge $12 a glass which is somewhat standard in the Bay area, but I never got poured less wine in a glass than here. It almost felt I get more wine when I go to a wine tasting. When I tried to bring this up with the waiter in a friendly and funny way and told him that I love this wine, he just mentioned he would let the chef know. I also asked if the Yelp check-in for 50% off cocktails would apply to wine, because I would take another glass if it would - he said no. I had two sips of the wine and the glass was empty. When I paid and was ready to leave, the waiter offered me another glass on the house - very wrong timing.

Overall the service was very friendly though and I ended up leaving a nice tip.

The place itself feels upscale, modern and cool. It could almost be in L.A. I feel it has huge potential but requires some serious work on the food, the prizes and the wine.</review><user_id>107651363527543844794<//user_id>< Name>

This establishment has been here for close to 9 years, and I have been here several times and every time I come here I am in and out. They are very professional and do quality work but most of all they are the most reasonable in price. Furthermore Dave really makes everyone feel right at home, he welcomes you with such courtesy and professionalism. Hopefully everyone that is in need of an honest smog check, then you need to visit SMOG BUSTERS.</review>

< review>
My truck failed the first time they said it hadn't cycled so he told me what I needed to do and I did it. I brought it back and it failed again. Now he tells me to take it to a mechanic even though there is not "check engine Light" no indicators of any problem with emissions. Went to mechanic and he reset whatever and then I drove it for 300 miles which is about 100 miles more than needed to get the system to cycle. Brought it back to mechanic he said after checking that I was good to go for smog. When I went in to get check the same guy in the front office treated me like 2nd rate person like he was being put out. This was my experience from the beginning. Then on top of his attitude he wanted to charge me again. I decided to take my business elsewhere to a person that appreciates the customer. I will never go back to Smog Buster nor will I refer anyone to them.
One last thing, I reviewed the paperwork he gave me and there was no mentioning of a another charge for a retest.<//review>

<text>Dave is a great guy and runs a tight ship. I come back year after year because they are professional, and they get my car smogged quickly. They are a great price compared to others in the area and they are the one smog shop I refer my friends and family to because I trust them. When your appointment is at 10 , they get you in at 10, not 10:30.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>The guy who runs this place is great, very nice and accommodating.  I stopped in before their normal hours, he was there, so he just let me in and did my smog check.  Good price and fast service.  They only test and do t do repairs, so you don't get sold repairs you don't need.  Can't ask for more than that.</Text>< Pictures>

I arrived 15 minutes before they opened.  I was the first person to speak with the man who opened up.  I told him I have a 2013 Ford van to get a smog test done on so I can sell it.  He told me that it takes too long and he couldn't do it today. He elaborated that the van had a hood inside the drivers compartment and that takes too long to remove.  I have never removed it so I returned to my vehicle, flipped 4 latches and removed it.  I then put it back on.  Total time 3 minutes.  Lazy    .<//review>

<Review>These people are great real friendly fast service, NOTE guys if you see the Groupon coupon call them before you buy it they will match most likely this is important because they are a small business and if you use Groupon they have to pay half of what they charge to Groupon. So support small businesses and call them first to price match, do this with any small business that offer Groupon. Again great place to go.< /Review>< pics>

<text>They booked our appointment friday. Apparently the computer went down so understandably the guys in the building today didn't have our appointment on file, however the man there said "we would take you, but we're just too busy right now" which given there were no cars, cpu was down so they had no appts to expect, means "I can do it right now but I dont want to" because the shop was empty and they were stuck talking about stuff unrelated to work.
If you're that lazy before you touch my car your work is going to be poor.< /text><Rating>1< /Rating><gmap_id>0x809b1fd745da168b:0xd8ca40fdec26069b</gmap_id><UserId.>102954870294651606660< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

They are the best! I call first to see when I can get in and they are always honest with me. Been going to them for years. Sorry, I haven't posted before this.

Smog Busters is an EXCELLENT option for smog certification. I called on a Friday and was able to get an IMMEDIATE appointment. Third time was a charm for me~2 other shops had issues processing my smog certification. BUT...Smog Busters had me IN-N-OUT within 30 minutes & gave me a FREE CAR WASH to top it off!!!  I received PROFESSIONAL service in a FRIENDLY environment. The price was REASONABLE and I will be back as a REPEAT CUSTOMER.
~THANK YOU~ SMOG BUSTERS~< /Review>

Fast and cheap with friendly service and a comfortable waiting area - not that you'll be there long enough to enjoy it.  I was in and out in under 15 minutes without calling ahead.  Crazy fast.  Smog Busters is definitely my new service center!  Grab their online coupon for extra savings.< /Text>

Needed a smog test for my 2016 honda. The service was fast, took about 10-14 minutes to get the work done but there wasn't a lot of customer when I got there. Here are the details about pricing, so you people know the exact price before going there. I called in the day before and quoted $40 total price (out of the door price). Their website have coupon for $20 discount that you can either print or save it on your phone,  but $40 is the price after $20 discount, that means the regular price is $60. When I called the day before I made a mistake by not clarifying about the discount and the person who gave me the price didn't say anything about coupons or anything. So I just assumed, because normally when someone quoted you a price, they will give you the regular price and then the total price after discount, if any. Usually when someone quoted you a price, they will mention if it is already a discounted price or not. When I showed up at the location today I was quoted for $42 and I mentioned that I have called yesterday and was quoted for $40. Then the lady said $40 is ok (coupon price/ total price). At the end she didn't ask for the coupon though even it says on the website that you have either print or save it on your phone.</text>

<rating>1</rating><text>CUSTOMERS BEWARE. I went in for a smog check December of 2016 and the so called "tech guy" triggered a U1000 communications error code. He is cranking and cranking the ignition switch and the car won't start because the keyless remote was not used properly to unlock the car.  I go there for a smog check and now I have a check engine light failure that I do not have any idea what to do about. I did some research and disconnected the battery for ten minutes to reset the car's computer. Drove the car for some 80 miles then went to a different smog check and passed without any problems. I will never take any of my cars to this place. Save your time and money and go to a reputable business.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

This place is a joke... The owner is lazy.
I took my vehicle in for a smog and he told me he couldn't smog it, it was too old....I let him know he tested this exact vehicle 6 months ago...It was very obvious he didnt want to work. I will let DMV know this is not a reputable Smog only shop.<//review>

These guys are a joke, their " equipment is always down " you call and make an appointment with them they say yes come in and you go there and all of a sudden their dyno is down, but there smogging someone on their dyno, yes sir I know what a dyno is, and my wife knows what a dyno is. Very rude too, I heard them talking bad about a customer after they left before they called me up.  Will never get my smog done there again, I used to bring my tundra there, with no problem because it is an easy paycheck fore them, the second they have to put in some work, their machines are down. Well your in the wrong business then,  you are there to perform a service to your customers. AAA recommended you to us, and I will tell AAA about this consistent issue. I have recommended this company to many friends and family members before they started doing this to me. 50% or more have turned away. Bad business practices. Good luck I hope you decide to change your practices.< /text>

<text>I never expected that visiting a smog shop could put me in a better mood than I was before, but my experience at Smog Busters was just so unexpectedly pleasant, it couldn't help but lighten my mood.

I happened to be in the Roseville area and Google'd smog shops to see what I could find on my way home.  Smog Busters was the first one I called.  I asked how much a smog check would be and the price I was quoted was a little lower than I expected.  This was my first time smogging our all wheel drive Dodge Charger and I knew that it couldn't be put on the dyno like shops usually do during a smog check, so I asked how much MORE that would cost me.  Even though it was clear that I expected it to cost more because of this, the gentleman who answered the phone (one of the owners) then informed me that he would actually take another $5 off the price because those were a little easier for him to do! It was a PERFECT opportunity for him to make some extra money on my smog check; not only did he NOT take advantage of me, he further discounted his, already low, prices!

So, I dropped by Smog Busters shortly after our phone call.  The facility was nice and clean and staff (owners) were friendly.  I was out of there in a matter of minutes.

My only complaint with this place is that it is way across town from my house, because I WILL be brining all my vehicles here from now on!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x809b1fd745da168b:0xd8ca40fdec26069b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>The staff were very rude and didn't care about any complaints you gave to them. They are very ignorant. I did not feel comfortable with my roommate and asked to switch rooms. They let me sleep in the lounge but never changed my roommate. I still felt uncomfortable and asked again if I could switch roommates. They said they couldn't, and their excuse was that I was "only switching rooms because I wanted to be roommates with one of my friends.'' So I had to sleep with the girl I felt uncomfortable with and had to wait for the next day to ask the new staff that came in if I could switch roommates. The groups were okay, but all we do is hang out with the other girls in the lounge all day. I didn't feel as if  I learned much with my time there. But, Carly, Louie, and my doctor Leonardo were the only ones who listened to me and my complaints. Other than that it was okay and the food was good for hospital food.</text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I was recently a patient there and when I first got into my room it was dirty. There was crumbs on my bed and on the floor and there was sticky stuff on the dresser me and my roommate told of the nurses and they said someone would come and clean it but they never did the nurses didn’t seem to care only Ms alyssia and Dom and Ms Tanya. But the patients there were so nice.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I was recently a patient at Canyon Ridge would've been absolutely horrible if the patients were not there. The doctors weren't helpful and most staff nurses did not handle problems or complaints. I was very happy with Miss Alicia, and three other nurses whom I can't recall their names.  The hospital wasn't sanitary or clean at all considering the pandemic going on. I do really love the pations there (with boundaries). I personally had a fun experience. Id like to go back :)</review>

I am an adolescent and Canyon Crest was my first mental hospital. It beat my very low expectations (still pretty good though). Group therapy, group activities, and Dr. Alkhouri helped me recover from a suicide attempt along with everyone else I met. Floor staff were awesome and really kind to me (Dom, Jackie, Cassie, Vanessa (the taller one), Daisy, and Ms. Tonya). The RN's are great too. Only complaint would be that the wall right beside the head of my bed smelt of pee. The rules within the ward are sensible.< /review>

Her 1st day there she had a situation and need change of clothes which I brought right away. However the next day when I talked to her she was still asking about her clothes that I had brought the day before that had not been given to her a full 24 hours later. She had not been able to shower or change clothes for her 1st 2 days while in they're care. Also since day one I have been asking to speak to her doctor whom never seems to be available and never return calls because My child hold  Expire in 1 hour and 15 minutes, still no one can tell me anything. They can't even tell me if she is going to be released or if they plan on extending her.

Only some rooms had hot showers. Most were only cold and the rooms were freezing too. Doctors kept you there longer than you need to. No useful groups (the schedule is a lie). No one checks on you - you don't got a nurse assigned to you and stuff like most hospitals. But the staff were chill though SHOUT OUT TO: Ms. Tonya, Ms. Alicia, Rocky, Ms. Victoria.

<rate>1<//rate><text>Horrible experience with them throughout to be honest. If you're looking for any kind of one on one professional care, do not go here. I stayed for 3 days volunterily and wasn't given the opportunity to speak to anyone about what was going on with me. I spoke to the doctor for ten minutes twice the whole time I was there. Nobody checks on you, the staff are rude when you ask questions, you basically hang out with the other patients the entire time. They let patients with more severe symptoms stay in units they don't need to be in due to "space issues". I actually woke up in the middle of the night to a man in my room walking towards me and security kicked him out but let him continue to walk the hallways. That same man chased me down the hallway the next day. Other patients tend to get touchy with the female patients and staff doesn't do anything about it. They promise outpatient care but I was set up with a clinic that doesn't even accept my insurance. Overall, most of the people I dealt with were lazy and unprofessional. And they make you stay longer than needed. Don't waste your money here.</text>< time>

<Review>My granddaughter has been here sadly several times. Worst of the worst mental health facility around town. Terrible doctors and case mangers. They lie to parents and clients and poor communication. Granddaughter went in due to serious med side effects and had a meltdown.  Dr. Lee changed her medications to Latuda. Upon discharge we learned he gave her no extra meds to cover 1 or 2 days until the prescription was filled. We ran into a brick wall in just trying to get her new medication. And the prescription was not officially approved. Latuda is so new that most insurances will not pay for it. My granddaughter was in a major crisis. Why in the hell would a doctor prescribe a medication that can’t be approved and further insulting we can’t pay $1600. for one medication. Dr. Lee is an unethical doctor who does not have your child or my grandchild well-being or best interest. Now we are in a difficult place with her being without meds and a high risk for another mental health crisis situation, because the Dr.Lee failed in making sure the child had her necessary meds. This is a killer hospital. They don’t care about the children and the doctor’s run around like they are servicing cows or animals instead of human beings...sad situation.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Horrible customer service. A friend of mine who is not a minor was sent against her will and called me a few times but I missed the call. I felt terrible and tried calling back for 30 minutes with absolutely no help. A woman picked up a few times and I told her my situation, she didn’t really seem to care and just carelessly put me in another line. Very frustrating. When my friend left a message for me she could barely even talk. I have no idea what they do to their patients there but I hope me or you reading this never have to find out.</Review>

<review>I was there during construction, so it was noisy and the windows were taped off. We couldn’t leave the main room we were in or anything. Weekend staff is always good in psych wards like these though so that was nice. Overall just an average hospital, nothing too special. Had to wait a long time to see my psychiatrist though</review>< Pictures>

<text>I have been to several behavioral hospitals in the past and I must say this was THE BEST in all ways!
The staff was amazing and always positive!  There was always activities going on all day!  We watched movies, listened to music,  did exercise, had group therapy 2x a day, had fresh air breaks, trips to the cafeteria for lunch and dinner, had Kareoke and live music entertainment.  I actually did not want to leave! :)  If a patient missed any meal the staff would make they got a tray, no matter what!  Also they had regular snack times throughout the day.
I have come home after 10 days feeling like I got the right treatment and will always have great memories of meeting some really nice people and learning alot about myself too.
Thank to Carlos, Susan, Jose, Frank, and many more there I cannot recall their names now.  May God bless all there at Canyon Ridge Hospital.  Fernando was an extremely great worker also,  all from Unit 5.</text></record></dataset><record>

This place is a big scam. The whole place is freezing, the showers are freezing, the blankets are so thin and the beds are so hard it gave me intense hip pain. The doctor did NOTHING to help me with my issues. In fact nobody did. The staff did nothing to break up fights. After ripping me off ten THOUSAND dollars, I’d think they would at least make this place decent. Do NOT go here unless you enjoy feeling like a neglected animal.<//Review>

This place is horrendously dirty. The staff can be very nice but can also be extremely rude depending on who you get. The food is nasty, they barely clean, and your stuff is not taken care of. My stuff was not returned and was lost by the staff. The only good part was my friends and some staff- would not recommend. This was rewritten by a youth that attended lol.<//Review>

I literally hate this place I just wanna cry thinking about this we didn’t get conditioner or even a brush, the staff were rude and would wait to let you go to the bathroom no one cares about the patients and the only good thing was the other patients and the food was ok, but it was a scam. The doctor tried to get me to stay and Tried To sell it off as if it was involuntary so they could keep me, also they told my parents I did stuff that never happened</text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>One of my employee's is being treated at Canyon Ridge Hospital, whatever they're doing there is a miracle. Before my employee got into this facility, he was very loud argumentative, and wanted to fight people. Currently he now has new friends, he says the staff talks to him and makes them feel comfortable.
When I visited this place yesterday to check up on him, the staff was very friendly on the phone giving me instructions on how to get there, and very friendly when I met them in person at both the lobby and at the unit my employee is housed at.

I strongly recommend this facility for anyone who has concerns about their mental hills, they definitely will feel a difference while being at this facility.</Text>< user_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I am posting to allow myself the benefit and give back to the Hospital. I've seen some bad posts and would like to say that I, myself, would like to continue going to program at this IOP. The staff and therapy is very nice and the groups, as intuitive as they are, could be very fun. I went thru a hard time in my life and was admitted in the hospital quite a lot of times and I think sometimes we have to play the hands we are dealt with good reason and strong virtue at the same time there is hardship and a misunderstanding as to why we are in the Hospital. Changing gears, the therapy could demand a lot of input. So people who don't talk should return, right? The answer is "No". They don't allow some people to return because of fighting. Tensions will grow, yet we need to see eye to eye on our goals that the Program lets us pursue. And other than the input, there really isn't anything you can say about what they want you to do. That's not necessarily a bad thing because the stuff they teach is really cool. It's just that! Ha! But as being admitted in the Hospital, not the IOP, is hard, I think the better part of security and safety casts the doubt that the staff can't really talk to you about because one would take advantage of Protocol and things like that. Maybe one doesn't need, but another might.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1595009961735, 'text': 'Hi, Reginald. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

<text>Doctor Jones is the very last thing a vulnerable person needs. Not at all compassionate. Does not listen to you. Attacks you for not having your complete health history due to lack of family. Expects you to diagnose yourself. The worst part of my life long mental health journey so far. Do not leave your loved ones in his care if you expect them to get appropriate treatment. Staff was extremely rude and verbally abusive. Inaccurate information on patients regarding everything from meds to allergies/dietary restrictions, to weight. Any normal/expected emotional behavior was met with overreaction (don’t cry in here or ask questions). Therapy was not offered or available. No direction given to newcomers by staff (other patients had to explain things to me because questions got you barked at). Did not turn on heat for days while staff wore coats. Nursing staff makes fun of patients. Did not see anyone leave who felt they received remotely acceptable care. I would not believe a place like this existed without first hand experience. Extremely frightening situation for anyone desperate for help. If you have a choice consider transferring your loved one into a different program/hospital if they end up here as they likely will lack the resources to advocate for themselves. Worse off than when I came.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This place is terrible.  No one provides details to family. Not even how long your loved one will be there. There is no one to answer phones.  If you get the receptionist-which is not often- you are sent through a phone tree where you are left listening to ringing. You are hung up on. They drug up the patients until they can barely talk.<//review>

<review>The facility and bathrooms(especially!) and bedrooms were dirty, and there was a lack of staff there and not responsive or there to help you. I was going through a lot of health issues there too and barely got assistance with that and going through severe benzodiazepine withdrawals and was given no medication to taper that and only offered medications from the doctor over the phone that I could not take because of my prior reactions and experiences with it and my physical state was very poor there. Main room is uncomfortable. There was also a very psychotic and hostile patient and a lack of rooms so I was forced to go into seclusion rooms which were being trashed by the patient who was around me) and unsanitary for a period of time and when I was being checked in and doing the processes with that which was quite upsetting and no nurses were monitoring.  it was gross and depressing. the people at the front desk were mean and uncommunicative. I didn’t see my doctor until the day I discharged and by the time I did I threw up afterwards in another room with running water. I also had no clothes except the gowns provided or real soap for several days or no one seemed to know about my dietary allergies. I was wrongfully put on a hold after a situation and had no opportunity to speak and didn’t get the help I needed. they don't give you a chance to be involved in your treatment or to explain to anyone your given circumstances. i felt unwelcomed and given rude stares by the staff there.< /review>< pics>

<user_id>115977247502469651081</user_id><Text>I signed in my grandaughter and we were asured that I can bring up her favorite snacks/food.  For the first 2 days, I had absolutely no problem.  Another mom was bringing her daughter food as well.  We met up in the foyer and had conversations as we wait to deliver the food.  On the third day, I show up, I encountered a receptionist named "Elsa". She came out from behind her desk walked right up to me pointed her finger at me and said "No food allowed". Her behavior was very aggressive, argumentative and unwarranted.I am a grandmother and she yelled at me as tho i was an errant child continually pointing her finger at me.  Up until then, I had no issue with anyone bringing snacks.  I was shocked by her demeanor.  I told her not to speak to me in that tone.  I then asked for her supervisor.  She told me that he was busy.  I told her that ill wait for him.  I stood in that lobby for approx. 30 minutes. Every staff was polite.  I asked several of them, can I bring in snacks?  They all smiled and said yes!!! Absolutely!!!  I even called my grandaughters unit while i was waiting and spoke to nurse Minh, he told me that I could bring in snacks for my grandaughter anytime.   Ella, was loudly telling everyone (nursing staff)  who passed coming and going, what had transpired and that I was breaking the rules and she was not going to allow that.  So when they passed by me, they would whisper that she is like that.  Just ignore her etc.  Did i mention I am black, ella is white, and the lady that i met two days in a row was white. After waiting a while, A large white gentleman named Eduardo  Longsworth spoke to Ella, I could hear the conversation thru the glass doors and Ella was telling him what had happened and she made sure to tell him several times that I was breaking the rules.  He approached me and we had a discussion, when I expressed to him the way I was yelled at and that she was pointing her finger at me, he just dismissed it as tho it was not an issue.  Needless to say, he supported Ella and I was not allowed to bring in snacks. Along with the snacks, i had clothes for my grandaughter because all she had were the clothes on her back.  Eduardo looked in the bag after i removed all the snacks, took my grandaughters clothes which included underwear, jeans and tops.  As of yesterday, My grandaughter said she never received her clothes.  I feel that this in retaliation and I would like someone to look into this matter.  Ive never been treated so horribly.  I would like to file a complaint because i cant get ahold of Eduardos supervisor with the number he provided for me.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< rating>

Not professional at all. Horrible inhumane treatment. Bad verbal language when taking medications. If you are lucky you see the Dr. once for three minutes and he will try to scare you off. Staff doesn’t let you sleep at all at night! They talk loudly in front of door. No privacy. The staff will look in the bathroom while you are in there if you take too long. I had a Christian cross necklace and they pulled it off my neck and broke it. The staff left scars on my left hand. They will restrain you from eating if they think you did something wrong. Very racist treatment and doesn’t let you pray in private. Uses male force upon women. The male holds woman down and straps them to bed. They are careless and won’t listen to what medication is better for you. Dirty place with floods in carpet and nasty beds. I had a thyroid problem and they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and placed me around drug addicts and put me with old males suffering from post war traumas. Do not go! I would definitely sue this “health” facility.</Text>

Okay so It was an okay experience for me, this place does not help with depression or sadness. I’m talking for the teenagers, not the adults, literally you are locked in a very small crowed place... food was actually really good but they seriously need to separate the kids with birth conditions with the ones with life occurring problems. Cleaning was okay but they could better. Don’t recommend this hospital for anything type of depression cure. Look for anther, this is just my opinion though. If it’s the closet to you then do it but good luck< /Text>

<Text>The staff were very kind, patient and considerate.  The groups were fun, thoughtful and engaging.  Food was surprisingly tasty.  Best of all, not once did I feel stigmatized by a single staff person.  All of my concerns were addressed promptly and I never felt like I was bothering anyone.  Also, unlike College, St. Joe's, and royale, I was able to speak to my doctor every day.  Communication was great and I knew what was going on with my treatment.  Facility is clean and orderly.  best care I've received in an inpatient setting.< /Text><Response>None< /Response><Time>1540798853317< /Time>< user_name>

I cannot emphasize how incredibly unethical this hospital is doing business.  My son was admitted under a 3 day hold.  It is now 5 days and the only reason they are not releasing him (they claim) is that he has not seen his psychiatrist.  He has seen a psychiatrist every single day.  There is no excuse for this other than they are bilking the insurance company.  THIS is why we pay unbelievable amounts of money for healthcare!

Do not go to this hospital and do not let anyone take you or your loved ones there.  You will be held captive!!  Criminals!!!< /Text>

Their case management and patient advocate departments are full of incompetent individuals I wouldn't trust to put two Legos together with instruction and video help. It is appalling that they are allowed to care for anyone.

I was there for 20 days and had the most wonderful experience ever! I was in the adolescent unit, unit 3, and it was really fun. I met so many new people there, including my ex. The food was bomb and the workers were nice and really funny. I got along with so many people there and the rooms were nice. They were big and had mirrors, unlike Collage Hospital. I give this place a 5/5 rating.</Text>

<review>Went here in october of 2018. This place was truly disgusting. my bed was not cleaned since the last person who used it and i knew this because they shoved a brush and deodorant under the pillow. (i came in with nothing) it’s DIRTY. I never saw them clean and i was in there for 5 days. The “nurses” had no compassion and were so incredibly rude. Honestly the worst place i have ever been. so unprofessional and honestly terrifying. If your loved one is sent here please please please try and get them out ASAP. This place needs to be shut down.< /review>< Pics>

< review>
What’s funny is that I’m reading all these comments after I came back from being a patient here and I’m seeing like so many negative comments which I don’t understand. It seems like everyone is just having their own complaints because I don’t really see one that’s the same. Which is weird in my opinion. I don’t know if they just expected “royalty” and treated specially or something but come on. Your at a hospital. Not just any hospital, a mental hospital. Everyone just gets treated differently because they don’t know how each person is. I’m not a doctor but it seems like it to me. Everyone is different, with there own personalities, with their own issues, and how they handling them.

I’m going to tell you my experience here. When I first got there, I will admit, it seemed scary as heck because I’ve heard about mental hospitals and ever since I’ve been depressed, I was always scared of going into one for many reasons. That’s besides the point.

The staff were really nice, welcomed me with open arms, and didn’t have any problems. They were very accommodating with my visual impairment too, which I thought they wouldn’t be understanding of considering where I was, but they were and that was surprising and amazing. They were easy to talk to as well, I didn’t talk much, but when I did, it wasn’t awkward or I didn’t feel scared or nervous. I ended up having a good conversation with one of them. They weren’t like super helpful, they did what they could.

The only thing that I WILL ADMIT was an issue was the doctors. They were not very helpful. They were kind of rude. THAT’S IT! Otherwise then that, everything else was great. I feel I gained more here then before. The girls were super friendly and nice, I talked to everyone there which is crazy because I’m not a talkative person. They were all very accepting and welcoming. I’m usually super shy and to myself.  I almost didn’t want to leave because it was better then what I currently lived with. That’s all I gotta say so hope everyone enjoyed!<//review>

Do NOT allow anyone you know to be admitted to this hospital. Absolutely disgusting treatment. My friend was misdiagnosed, given improper medication, dehydrated to critical levels, and was having constant seizures until moving to a new hospital after which everything immediately improved and he was fine. They didn't have a doctor on staff most of the day, refused to listen to serious and relevant medical concerns, and weren't educated in the matter that resulted in him being admitted in the first place.

If you're reading this and had a similar experience, please know your rights and look into medical malpractice claims. No one deserves to be treated like they are here.</Text>

Was there alot n 8 years been alot of places. Must say they're the best foods good they're concerned for u and they are there if u need them only downside is if ur on a bunch of benzos they discharge u with no prescription which is cruel cuz then ur left detoxing when u get out. If ur on 4 diff benzos for a month n come out with none let me tell u from experience it's worse than withdrawaling from heroin. Need to give u a small script for something to help ween u off. But it's cool I'm going today to check back in. And plus u can smoke which is a plus</Review>

< Review>
This place is a sham.  My daughter was sent here.  Worst place ever.  They lie to you to try to get you to stay longer.  I am just glad we caught them in a lie or she would have still been there.  If you are thinking about this place.  Keep looking.  They don't care about anyone in this place.  The only good thing about this place was the group talks.  Everything else the staff just does not care.  I seen it myself.  The Doctors spend max 5 minutes with them a day.  No back in forth.  Just one sided.  Please research to find a better place.  She has told me story's what has gone on in there.  So I started looking on the internet and everything she had said someone already posted.  All bad.  We are looking into trying to get this place shut down.  They straight up held her against her own well.  We caught them in a lie.  This is the only reason she was discharged.  The Night Director supervisor straight up lied to me and daughter.  When she called them out on this they said she could leave.

SO NEVER SEND YOUR LOVE ONES HERE.  it is all true what is said  about this place.< /Review>

<text>My Son is being there couple times , but 1/2 /2020 my Son was transported from UCLA hosp to C.R around 2:30 pm I call ucla they say your Son is being transferred, I call C.R the same day say give more time bcz is not in , so I call the next day they say hes not being there it all. I try to leave messages finally I speak to a Nurse she admitted my Son was there but being released on Friday 1/3/20, I ask her were my Son was released bcz they know im hes Mother and they have record of all my information phone # address bcz my Son is on the  Out patient Program with them Monday thru Friday . I left a message for the Director staff of the hosp She never returned my calls , she was aware i want to know we're they took my Son. Now on Friday I call her voicemail say she's coming back until 1/14/20 . I'm worried about my Son well being bcz he has Mental illness was the reason he went to Ucla on 1/1/20 at 2:00 pm was taking by LB Met team me being present.
My point to post my This is bcz I feel this hosp are irresponsible and need to be investigated, knowing this patient's are not stable why they don't call a family member the is on the Medical  records already.!!</text><Name>Mary Ulloa<//Name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Date>1578824062546<//Date><gmapID>0x80c333287ae06061:0xd88d80f39b5aafe5<//gmapID><response>{'time': 1579029626527, 'text': 'Hi, Mary.

<Text>I was recently taken here during one of the lowest points of my life. I did not want to live and so I was sent here for observation. I thought I would be able to talk to some therapists one on one, but that is not what this place is. Canyon Ridge basically holds people there so that they will not hurt themselves, and that is all. I kept asking for a therapist to talk to, and the nurse would say they would get someone, but no one ever came. I suffer with social anxiety, so when they told me to join the groups, I couldn't think of anything worse. Why would I want to divulge the most humiliating and devastating thing that ever happened to me to a group of strangers? You only get to talk to the psychiatrist for a couple of minutes because they have so many patients to go through. He put me on anti-depressants and told me to join the groups. The third day I was there I decided to sit in one of the groups and I was glad that I did. Eventually I started joining as many of the groups that pertained to me and I found people to talk to and have fun with. That part was very healing as opposed to isolating myself to my room. Some parts of the hospital are very clean, but they do need to update their bathrooms. The bathrooms are filthy. My shower curtain had black mold on it, and the shower would not drain. Also, fruit flies came flying out when I would move the curtain aside. It is difficult to sleep because people are coming into your room every ten minutes or so to check on you, and basically shine a flashlight in your face, which I find really disrespectful. I had one of the workers sitting outside my room all night coughing, rustling papers, or clicking her pen. Let people sleep!! Other than that, the cafeteria food was pretty decent, which was surprising. If you are going to go here, I suggest joining the groups and making sure to eat regularly. It can be a healing place if you let it.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

If you do not want to read all the review at least know that I took the time to write this review to prevent others from being taken advantage of at Least take this advice PLEASE IF YOU HAVE A LOVED ONE THAT IS GOING TO GO HERE DO NOT ALLOW IT AT ALL COSTS!!! PLEASE BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE FOR A REASON SO MANY PEOPLE CAN NOT BE WRONG. My daughter was here early July 2019 in the adolescent unit. When my daughter was taken here from the emergency department I read all the reviews and was willing to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I came to find they were nurses that were kind to my daughter to name them Carlos, Tonya, and Calary they are the reason why I gave them one star. My daughter told me that the group therapies were no help and they would allow her to get upset instead of calming her down (except the nurses above) to medicate her through injection. When she was taken there by an ambulance the hospital did not allow me to go with her. She was originally in for a 3 day hold because she was having suicidal thoughts and hearing voices. The psychiatrist told me that she would be coming home after the 3 days since she was being calm I received a call from the psychiatrist only the first morning and the other two days that they said he saw her he didn't call it was very difficult to get a hold of him and the social worker ever since my daughter was admitted. Then after the 3 days that morning the psychiatrist stated she had said she wanted to kill herself and he was putting her on a 14 day hold (even after I told him she was extremely far from home I had to drive 2 hours to there and back to visit my daughter for one hour) then he stated she had to have 24 hours of not having those thoughts or hearing voices. Within the next 24 hours my daughter was no longer hearing voices or having suicidal thoughts the psychiatrist called saying that due to her tantrums she had to stay longer and that the judge had seen her the day prior and had determined she had to stay. I told him the social worker had told me there were no more appointments for Tuesday and she was scheduled for her hearing on Friday in the morning (ACCORDING TO THE SOCIAL WORKER THE HEARINGS ARE ONLY TUESDAYS AND FRIDAYS)  I told him he was a liar and that I would be reporting them for unethical practice because my daughter was no longer at risk and she was having tantrums NOT A PSYCHOSIS AND THEY WERE USING MEDICATION AS A PUNISHMENT PROCEDURE TO MAKE HER SLEEP. In addition I told him she was a minor and they could not have a hearing without me as her parent representing her and after saying he was not going to release her and being caught in a lie he released my daughter the same day. This place is like a prison does very little to give a better life after hospitalization only focuses on medicating their patients when for mental health you need medication and positive therapeutic environment that involves the entire family unit. They are hard to communicate with and LIARS. They take advantage of patients medical to get more money! They allowed fast food but not homemade food didn't make sense to  me at all.
WHAT IS BELOW VERY DIFFERENT THAN THIS PRISON!
She went back end of July to a different hospital they are more friendly have created a plan for life after the hospital have group, individual, and family therapies that we can attend. Her younger siblings are allowed to visit her. The place does not search you or treat you or the patients like they are in a prison. They calm my daughter down rather than let her escalate to medicate her. They have a point system that the patients can earn to use different things rather than giving it to them. They estimate her stay being 3-5 days and they have a family contract to integrate the patients to their life after the hospital.  At this hospital does not allow any outside food to be brought which makes more sense. This other hospital the psychiatrist and social workers reach out to me on a daily basis to update me on how she is doing and respond to me the same day within a few hours.< /Text>

i wouldn't know what a 5 star mental hospital would be like so im gonna say this can all improve. to CRH you asked so here factual with no bias, i professionally determine failures in retail and hospitality businesses so from start to finish unit 1.

Although walk way into main entrance is easily seen... the 50 ft drive into is not well lit. theres a medium of grass last night i saw two vehicles miss and jump the curb especially when it rains this is a potential hazard.

front door needs clear signage for any new person specifically steps to get past first 2 doors.

get rid of the one key to rest room i understand safety concerns and privacy but taking a standard accessible lock just because it was easier to install then buying a dedicated lock for the bathrooms makes me think that its a fleet lock that key may work on more then one door. and once one person uses the key they either make the other restroom inaccessible or have to leave the key removing the privacy aspect of the lock... get a lock that can be opened with out a key cant be accidentally left locked and if need be force entry.

train staff on procedures. and professionalism each one does visitation differently and isnt consistent.

Drama I see alot of petty bickering among staff some have little inner office power trips others wanna smile and say how they just want to be helpful but really they feel somehow superior they let slip disdain each time they want to hover over another employee and get ignored when they start talking about how they would do something. sprcifically one lady was new she acted new did everything the new kid does. i asked for an item out of a patients things. she couldnt find the binder to confirm the patient or item existed. didnt know where to go or who to ask and told me to wait in the lobby after an hour and a half she finally said i could come back in the morning. at all those steps it wasnt untill i asked another person in front if her to help her gind the binder. the page. where does she go and who does she talk to. basically she didnt know what she was doing and refused to ask others for help that shows me a failure in her to communicate or the entire staff to not step in and help or making her think she was on her own.

when a code grey happens first the front office person must not freak out and people who are to stop the code grey should attend but doesnt mean everyone else in staff needs to stop doing what they are doing. especially the administrative side should be able to function in an emergency situation but a guy running in the hall shouldn't completely disrupt the work.

rearange lobby seating instead of facing the restroom and seeing and hearing each conversation the person in line has turning our necks to see the entrance and exit door... have us facing the great wall of photos that way privacy goes up no more neck pain and anyone runs out we all saw it happen< /Review>

I watched a girl I met in here get into a physical altercation with a nurse and the worst part was that instead of following his training and restraining her, the dude threw hands back. I'm jus here to let y'all know that this place has a lot of issues but there was quite a few good meals and some good staff members. Specifically Tonya and Brittney. Having open process group was also super helpful and getting to color and listen to the radio during activity groups was fun as hell. My main issue is the lack of cleanliness. My bed smelled like vinegar and stuff came out of the shower drain when I turned on the shower.</text>

My son lost his 2 front teeth, he was taken to the nearest hospital which is in Chino. Upon arriving to the E.R. I see my son's mouth full of blood his lips busted. This was my worst nightmare. No explanation was given to us.
I would be very concerned about having a loved one sent here.</Text>

That's really too bad this place has so many horrible reviews, that was not our experience here. A loved one was placed in this hospital a while back and he was well taken care of and is back to living life. I had some trouble getting communications from the case manager but I can only imagine how much they have to deal with each day. As someone that's worked in the mental health industry I can understand some of the difficulties of this job, but they seemed to do a great job, for us at least. I think some of the issues I’m reading in other reviews are regarding communication, and I hope everyone realizes that like all medical facilities, Canyon Ridge is forced to uphold HIPAA laws. Without consent (which most patients here are probably incapable of giving in the beginning) they cannot even confirm or deny your loved ones presence. That being said, I was on consent and did experience some issues getting through to my loved one’s case manager, but like I said, they can only do so much. Everything important was communicated to me. Thank you Canyon Ridge.<//review>

<Review>An associate of mine was admitted here. They  discharge patients that aren't ready to be discharged because they can't pay. She happened to have good insurance and had her hold extended repeatededly without any sort of clear reasoning given. The doctors wouldn't see her for more than a few minutes and the only treatment administered was hours and hours of mandatory group therapy. 0/10 would not recommend.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c333287ae06061:0xd88d80f39b5aafe5<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>I honestly hate to give this place a one star review.
A bit over 1 year ago.

I had reached a breaking point in my life. A lot of people do. I had a Psychological break down.

I was taken from the emergency room to Canyon Ridge. The employees were not cruel or malicious however they did not seem to enjoy their job most of the time. Fair enough, you are working in a Psych Ward, I referred to it as an Adult Daycare because that is entirely how it felt. I was checked on every 5-10 minutes, even while sleeping which was difficult because it would wake me up often in the middle of the night.
Loved ones begged me to listen to the Psychiatrist and try the medication he provided. The medication failed miserably. When the nurse who checked on me noticed, she did nothing to assist me, understand why I was on the floor shaking, or even report it.

Throughout my stay there under the 51/50, they constantly would send their largest male nurse to confront me about refusing to get in the medication line and I had to repeatedly tell the nurses about the experience the medication caused and they continued to not record it and pressured me to shut up and take the damn pill. I had to learn to "No." to doctors and nurses whom clearly don't know better and don't care.

Which is one reason why the experience was god awful but I wouldn't change that because it forced me to become stronger, however, most people don't function with that mentality so it is a horrible situation to be in and need to learn to grow up and stand for yourself.

The other patients were actually far more supportive and kind as opposed to talking with the Psychiatrist which had no time to talk. Out right said "If you aren't here to find a drug to help you fix yourself, then there is nothing more we can do for you." They do not have the staff to support therapist talks, they entirely rely on the other patients to help the other patients. That was made very clear to me.

However, as the few days went by, people got released and the new set of individuals whom were brought in flooded the facility and we started to have people with clear and alarming mental derangement, some of which would hiss or attempt to attack staff or other patients.

I was in the suicide and drug addiction ward, that's not a normal type of person in that ward. That is someone who requires full time staff attention and should not be in any general public.

Some of the nurses were actually kind and saw me as just another human, they understood that it was just one really bad day and one really bad judgement call I made that landed me there, but not all the nurses were like that.

So the reason for one star is largely I feel that there are unquestionable better locations that are not over populated, understaffed, underpaid. It is a dice roll for your loved one if they get sent there under a 51/50 or even bring themselves there.

I don't hold the employees in contempt, but I am going to do my damnedest to never be sent back to any place like a Psych Ward ever again because of the over all experience.

For the people such as David, Gina, Maizy, Axle, Robert, gosh I can barely remember the other names of all the people whom I talked with in the group talks and 1 on 1. They were the people that helped me find myself again and right myself. The location however leaves so much to be desired.

I don't give it 1 star with joy, but because I know if it wasn't for the other patients I interacted with, it would have been a horrible experience. Their food is okay, they have a soda machine which is awesome, but if I want free soda and a wild emotional swing in my life, I'll just go to a god damn casino.

For any nurse that might actually for some weird reason remember my name, or the group therapist leader, I can't remember her name to save my life. You were not the problem, however, you and I both know there are not enough like you employed at that location to be a successful solution. Nor is there enough money to make that the case.</review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

<Review>Incredibly rude and condescending staff. Hung up on me several times and would instantly transfer me to lines that never picked up because they didn’t want to answer any questions I had. Also had the WRONG NAME of the patient listed. How are these people not trained better to have any sort of tact or amount of professionalism? Not to mention proper safety conduct? They don’t even allow pens or pencils for journals. Incredibly dehumanizing and childish treatment for adults who need genuine care and understanding. The lack of caution or care given to basic safety protocols is appalling.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c333287ae06061:0xd88d80f39b5aafe5</Gmap_id></record>

All of the staff in Outpatient treatment are very supportive in walking me through the process of addressing my issues.  After a hard process session, they stayed with me to allow me a little extra time.  They back up their efforts with scientific facts and share new findings.

They are aware of the stigma of mental illness and help us move forward as a productive member of society regardless of those stigmas.

The only regret I have is that I didn't come to them earlier.< /text>

The worst experience of my life was in this place!!! I was forced to go into this place due to a statement I made to a  Dr. that was misinterpreted. I was feeling depressed and this place made me more depressed than I ever was. This place was supposed to help but after being locked up I just went to my room and cried. I was in a crazy hospital with a staff that apparently had no education or training. The other patients were all crazy and I was hit three or more times while there. I experienced other patients coming into my room and getting into my bed in the middle of the night. I couldn't eat the food and finally took crackers and cartons of milk into my room to eat. I intend to do something after going through hell. They are sucking money from medicare and other insurances that do no good. This place is dirty and smelled of urine. I have nothing good to say about this awful place from hell.</Text>

Profoundly unhelpful. Phones aren't answered. Calls aren't made. Patients are treated with contempt. Food tastes terrible (no surprise there). I thought mental hospitals would be more helpful, but I was more successful in my own efforts, making my own calls and personally sending info, than their entire professional network.

Dennis, the addiction counselor, was great. He alone made this review more than one star.

No one wants to be in a mental hospital, but a staff with a bad attitude makes i so much worse. If you have any other option, it's likely a better one than this hospital.</text>

<Review>I had a loved one referred to this facility.

This place is the worst run facility I have ever seen. Staff is unprofessional and has what can only be described as an "I don't give a %#*$"/"When can I get out of here" attitude. Most of the time they were asking the person I knew what meds were to be given, not because they were checking to see if the patient was aware of what they were supposed to receive, but because they didn't know. The person I speak of didn't even have an identification bracelet or a medicine chart for the first two or more days.

The care and caregivers are probably the worst I have ever seen. It is literally like a prison, not somewhere one would get help, so, if you or someone you know or love is being sent here, don't expect help or healing. I'd say to expect things to be worse after they are released due to the emotional and mental trauma they will experience at this facility.

My first hand experience insists I warn you to stay away from here at all costs. At. All. Costs.< /Review></record>

<text>It is 8:24 pm, 8/18/2016. Receptionist and another person chatting upfront. I asked for my sister due to was allowed to see her for a few minutes to bring clothes after flying 3500 miles and 6 hour car ride. Receptionist wanted me to call the unit and pointed to some numbers to find which one she was in. Am I the receptionist? Hello? I am a Occupational Therapist. Been an OTR for almost 10 years and this is how you treat someone in a facility just coming for the first time.   I waited in the lobby and heard them talking about me and being rude. I will continue to update my journey on this after I am allowed to see her.

Update:
So receptionist told me to take my phone back to the car. No cell phones allowed. That is a reasonable request.  So I took my phone back and came right back on. She locked the door as I tried to open it. It was just open 2 minutes ago when I was in there! She and the other women laughing and finally let me in. You could see on my face I was upset. And the women said "oh lord". I was nice... After a long flight and drive I just wanted to get my loved one her clothes and things and make sure she was doing fine.

Now 9:02 pm. My sister wanted to go smoke so at 9pm they go out with the nurse. I left and the other person who was standing with the initial receptionist was not there. The nurses in the back were professional and nice. And we're attentive to patient needs as requested. The nurse Denise the RN was very nice. When I told her I wanted the name of the receptionist she said ok but never did give it. I didn't press the issue either as I know by the time stamp I am giving they will figure it out. I will be calling and discussing with management tomorrow when I come back during the day. Will update again tomorrow.</text>< user>

I was trying to call a patient here and these rude employees that answered the phone (1 time) just hungup on me.(45 min worth of calls) I go for a visit and these “registered nurses” lied on medical documents saying my loved one saw a psychiatrist but she never did. They tried lying to my face then the nurse cy or whatever his name is cowarded away and left while other nurses trued shushing me because they are attempting to lie on legal documents. This isn’t just an awful place for mental rehab, it is a place that doesn’t deserve to be called a hospital.<//Review>

<Text>Canyon Ridge my son,dealing with Anger, Rage Depression! Me not knowing the next steps that were going to happen, walking in not knowing what was going to happen to my son that just tried to take his life.  Not knowing,mental hospital laws are completely different from a regular hospital I was terrified. Could talk to,a doctor right wanted my son medicated not knowing how he was going to come home. I met a Medical Mike he went the extra step to help me calm fown , give me the information and,numbers I,needed to see what was going to,happen,next, with out Mike I,would,of made it.... No,doctors communication was horrible especially because my son was a minor. But mental doctors obligations are completely different that a regular doctor they dont have to report to f family regularly unless needed. Thank Mike for being there with out wouldnt of got thru

<text>This place helped me save my life at its lowest moment. We were encouraged to spend our days outside of our rooms and into common areas inside and outside. It is of benefit to communicate with the other patients (we avoided anything grim or gritty) and learned how people from so many different walks of life had ended up there.
There were group activities every hour for 6 hours during the day including physical activity in a separate gym area. A TV room, an outside (small grasses area) patio. Three meals a day in a separate fairly large buffet style cafeteria and snacks an additional 2-3 times a day. These snacks depended on your individual nutritional needs. There was laundry on site. Two-bed rooms with private shower. You were allowed a couple of 10 minute phone calls a day to check in with family or whomever.
On the medical side, there were group counseling sessions, an individual case manager, a nutritionist, psych techs who passed meds and collected daily vitals, and of course the (rarely seen) doctor. At night they did walkthroughs every 15 minutes. I felt safe and supported and stayed 2 extra days until I felt sure I was okay. I trusted them with my life and I’m here because they jump started my now current treatment. Thank you. April 2016<//text>< Pictures>

Very bad communication at this place.  It seemed to me like the patients were running the place.  The adolescents were able to make phone calls at all hours and to whom ever they want.  This was never disclosed to us as parents.  Our adolescent was there to be "helped" and I don't see how letting her call whomever she chooses without notifying us is ok.  We never received a list of rules/guidelines from the facility.  Our adolescent called us with a list of items to bring her (clothing and hygiene) but the facility never notified us of any restrictions on the items.  This was our first time in this sort of situation, a little guidance/communication would have gone a long way.  Many times I called to the facility and no one would answer.  Yet I learned that my daughter was receiving many incoming phone calls from her "friends"... ridiculous!  I tried to call and speak with the psychiatrist because he wanted to give our adolescent some meds, but got no answer...  tried several times to no avail.  We went in for a family meeting with our adolescent and all the adolescents got together to flip us off and cuss us out as we left the meeting... they were literally shouting and hurling expletives, completely out of control.  I don't see how this facility was of any help to our adolescent.  She came home worse.  I would never recommend this facility to anyone.  The only way to post this is if I give it at least 1 star...  but it really deserves 0.</Text>

< Review>
From Broken to Hope
I arrived with a broken soul
Somehow this place,
-	staff and others like myself changed the tears to laughter
Not just a smile on the surface of my face But a smile on my heart.
Broken soul
-	No longer so broken but instead full of hope and strength.
Fear of tomorrow is there but so is the light
-	and the strength  that people here planted within my heart.
I realize we all have different experiences of people and places-
But as of for me nothing but love for the staff of this unit.
And as for the patients that I was so lucky to have met- nothing but love
Understanding and unity.
6 days- from broken to hope.
The review of my stay at Canyon Ridge Hospital

Reason of stay:  Depression/ Nervous breakdown</Review>

Except for maybe 4-5 the entire staff treats you like a crazy person regardless of how kind and "rule abiding" you are. I did more than I was asked and was exceptionally kind. I was kept and extra day, talked down to, and placed In a room with a roommate who urinated on the floor and told me about the voices and screams he was hearing.

I was discriminated for being transgender like I had a disease and would infect people.

<Review>Overall good hospital but it is a prison like hospital, no tweezers, no shoes (too tall? . . .)  Staff was really good except the doctors who want to over medicate you and keep you for the good insurance money. That will get them a licensing complaint. Dr. Baclos is a terrible physician and can't even verify license!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Date>

This place is horrid! I was placed here involuntarily after having a crisis (severe depression) Instead of leaving feeling like I got help I left feeling worse! You get treated like trash. The overall vibe of this place is like a prison. Everything is locked down and the nurses ignore you. You could be standing in front of 3 nurses at the nurses station waiting to ask them a question and they will stand there and ignore you even continue a 20 minute long conversation. Once they do come around to ask you what you want they all have this pissed off look on their face like "don't ask me for anything else." You really don't get psychological help here. All they do is ask you how you're feeling and they write everything down. These sessions with a therapist are so brief you don't get anything out of them. There was group meetings where they INSIST you share something and they flat out tell you the more group meetings and the more you share the better chances you have of leaving sooner. So even when I didn't feel like sharing I did just to get the hell out of there! Oh yeah they also make sure to prescribe just about everyone an anti psychotic/depression med... It's just not a good place to get someone help. I look back at my experience at this place and it was more traumatic than my actual crisis I was having. If anyone is looking to place a family member here please don't do it. They are better off in some outpatient therapy with a REAL therapist who can provide feedback and coping skills. People here are treated like a herd of cows...

The whole time I was there, there was only 1 Philipino nurse with long hair who took the time to talk to me like I was a normal human being when I'd sit alone...and I don't remember his name but I remember he looked like John Lennon and he knew a lot of Beatles songs. The night I was waiting to be discharged I was sitting in the waiting room and he came in and sang Beatles songs to me before I left. I'll never forget that.
This facility needs to hire more people like him.<//review>

< Review>
aight lemme spill the tea on yall. i got dishcarged 3 days ago and i hated it here so much like the staff was very petty and rude like  held open the door for a guy and the nurse gave me a dirty look like i just committed a crime. but i wanna give a shout out to Tonya,Alicia,Anna, and Jessie. Call time should be anytime of the day and visiting hours are like so short! the food was decent but the lobby where i stayed was very dirty and the floors were disgusting! I wish we had more time outside or had time to GO outside for once and more talking, like the group talking session didn't do anything. Like sure this place has helped for some people but it surely hasn't for me. It was hell there and there were writings on the wall, rude staff members, a pentagram on my closet/cubby. I felt like an human experiment there. They dont help<//Review>

**DO NOT GO HERE for treatment,  Patient on patient violence constant.  Staff helps out but no reports are made and no repercussions for bad behavior.
You really just get pills thrown at you and you get 2 visits from the Dr a week . and no real counseling other than group counseling.  Boring and unpreductive place to do time.< /text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>Ok I got admitted here recently for depression and stuff and they put me on pink rounds?? (Btw pink rounds is high suicidal risk) If you know me in real life, I'm actually quite outgoing and happy. I don't mind getting admitted for depression but pink rounds? There were girls literally cutting themselves and bleeding with pencils and sticks? Now that's high suicidal risk, not me? Like why? And the doctors are almost NEVER there. I was supposed to be discharged on a Sunday as I was told by my school district, but because the doctor wasn't there on Sunday, I got discharged on a Tuesday. I missed many important things which I would have been able to go to, if my doctor was actually there. Most of the other patients were pretty nice, a couple outbursts but nothing too drastic. They never really take time to talk individually to each one of the patients, mostly group sessions which most believe isn't much help at all. And some of the nurses were very rude. A couple choice nurses were nice, but wow we're the other ones rude. I was about to take my vitals and one of the nurses grabbed me really hard to a point where it was painful and had a horrible attitude. And plus while I was there, a certain very innapropiate situation between a nurse and a younger patient occurred. I met a couple friends, friends whom I still talk to this very day, which is nice. But, I assure you my visit at this facility was not a pleasant one.</review>< user_name>

< review>
I was a patient after I argued with a cop, and he couldn't legally throw me in jail, they denied my civil right to due process, and only let me out after I filed a complaint.

By the way, the easiest way to get out of one of these places is to file a complaint. I got thrown into psychiatric hospitals by white cops, and all of them HAD TO release me after I complained about civil rights abuses. Like denying showers to patients as a form of punishment, and starvation like me, or physical abuse to black people, I saw three black people attacked by staff for no reason. This place needs to be shut down.< /review>

<review>Was admitted here for a 51/50 72 hour hold. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Head warnings... I am no suicidal, I have a life. I pertained work injury from unloading the trucks and received cuts or gashes on my arms. I was pulled over by a cop and the cop submitted me 51/50. The nurses here had me waiting for a room that was suppose to be ready for me. The room smelled of urine and the bed wasn't made or washed.  I self induced myself into a lucid dream to sleep faster. Everyone is on seroquel, an untraceable drug for anti psychotic. Mostly used on bipolar and schizophrenia.  I'm a pysch major. I managed to play best behavior and trick the two psychiatrics and 4 RNs who wanted to evaluate me and keep me for 2 months. They also messed up my items and almost didn't give me back my shoes. My roommate I shared a room with had a seizure and stroke all at the same time the first night I spent. He wasn't receiving treatment let alone support the next day by the nurses or doctor's.  Do not come here at all. I notice myself zoning out dad by day remembering this traumatizing event and I'm losing hair from the stress from this place.<//review>< user_name>

<username>Ace G<//username><date>1512508191104< /date><Pics>None< /Pics><text>Hi I just wanted to give my say on the place myself just to give people an idea what is going on inside.
First a bit about myself. I was there due to a psych evaluation at an ER because I had a concussion (from a car crash) and also had suicidal thoughts(I hadn't taken action yet to kill myself I just had the thoughts). I spent 12 some hours in the ER and they said my 72 hour hold started When I got there.
I should have gotten a red flag when I was told my doctor was present as I was taken in and he didn't end up seeing me. (I also had gotten there at 10 pm. Why is a doctor seeing his patients at night?) But I was too tired to think about it.
Honestly the next day was fine. I got up at 5am for bloodwork and vitals. Breakfeast and group. Saw my doctor and here is where the other red flag should have shown. He only spent 3.minutes. Talking to me. And my case worker spent maybe 5 minutes.
I'm not on any medication nor have I been for years and so when my doctor wanted to prescribe me Lexipro (a sleeping pill) I asked if I could read about it first. I had never gotten a packet on the drug or anything.
I ended up not taking it (which I guess if you dont show up in line for your meds they dont come after you which was another bad sign).
Come my last day, I was aware I would have to wait till 10 pm for the whole 72 hour hold to be up. I wasnt feeling suicidal anymore and I had plans for when I was to leave. I thought I would at least see my doctor that day so the following day I could be released. Staff told me my doctor (Dr. Alakhan for those wondering) was to come in at 11 pm. I thought it was weird that he came in so late but I decided to be patient and wait.
He never showed up and I ended up passing out at 2 am ish (we don't get clocks in our room so it was hard to say).
I asked the staff in the morning when he would come in next. They said 5:30-7pm maybe. Ok. Ill wait a bit more maybe there was an emergency. I can be patient.
Come that time still hadnt showed and when I asked yet again they told me 10:30pm at latest.  At this point I thought it was ridiculous but there was nothing I could do but wait. Finally at 11:35-ish he comes to see me. I went in with him and he looked at my discharge paper for a second then signed it. Nothing was said. I hadnt even began to talk about plans/feelings/meds nothing. He just signed me off.
At that point I was more relieved because I had my ride waiting for about a day now and I just wanted to go home to get my life back together.

My step son, who's still a minor, was transferred here from the hospital so we had no choice at the time. After a week being there we NEVER received a phone call from any of the doctors with a diagnosis or any communication ever!! My husband specifically called and said he wanted to speak with the doctor BEFORE they went in and spoke with my step son. NOT ONCE did they do this. How freaking hard is it to call and be in constant communication with a parent when you're dealing with a minor. Today they told us if we took him out we wouldn't get a prescription WTH!!! They are trying to hold us hostage to do what they want with absolutely no communication.  Going to be looking into
An ethics/ medical violations and what ever we can to get acknowledgement that this is wrong! Parents need to be involved every step!!!</Text>

I had a relative stay here for treatment-during a visit a young women (adult) was discharged with just a bus pass. She wandered the parking lot for a couple of hours, then a few of us (visitors) gave her some money and food.  I wonder if that patient is still alive?   She was a meth addict and prostitute (who looked about 14) and no concept of reality who had latched on to a very ill young man at the facility.  No outside resources, no way to get her readmitted. Just bu-bye! Needless to say my relative wanted to and was able to get the hell out of that place the next day.  The sad thing is if you really need mental health help, beds are hard to find even if you have money, good treatment is sketchy, it all feels like a big impersonal machine of loss and death.<//Text>

<Review>Canyon Ridge neglected my needs for my women's health, my mental health, my right to refuse medication, and my plans for discharge. I arrived at Canyon Ridge late at night from being transferred from another hospital. These are my complaints:

1) Upon arrival, I was waiting on a stretcher as a (receptionist?) came up to me, pulled out a camera, and took my picture without telling me what she was doing. This came across as really rude and made me feel very uneasy. This was the first red flag.

--How to fix this: before taking a PT's picture, please be more polite and state WHY you're taking the picture. This is supposed to be a place to help you, to make you feel safe -- not to make you feel like a prisoner or some type of "experiment."

2) While in the ambulance, I started menstruating extremely heavily. When I arrived to the hospital, I asked immediately for disposable underwear or some type of pad. It took me a while to receive these and I was given a bit of attitude. Almost "disgust" from some of the nurses that were admitting me. This made me feel dehumanized as well as degraded. Almost like my women's rights were getting stripped because I was a PT at a Mental Hospital. Is menstruation an uncomfortable subject in a hospital or are mentally ill people less of people because of the mental health stigma?

--How to fix this: provide more options for women's reproductive health. For a whole day I had to wait to get a new and clean pair of underwear while I was waiting in my bloody underwear and a pad on top of the dried blood. I would suggest supplying underwear, sanitary wipes, and overall: a better attitude when a woman comes into the hospital with her period when she has nothing available on her first day.

3) When I was admitted, all the rooms were full. Another PT that got admitted at the same time as me got put in a different unit--one where he shouldn't have been which made him feel uncomfortable and unsafe with the other PT's. On my behalf, I was put in a seclusion room for the night. The seclusion room made me feel uncomfortable and really anxious. I think anyone would feel this way upon their arrival. I asked if I could just stay in front of the nurse's station for a little bit, but I got shoo'd away back to the seclusion room.

How to fix: I would suggest that if you do put PT's in the seclusion room due to the lack of rooms, and they're uncomfortable with the seclusion room, just let them stay in the PT's lobby until they're comfortable to go back in the seclusion room. You're there to help the patients feel safe and less-anxious. I did not feel safe at all my first night there. Plus, the patients are still on surveillance in the lobby -- so I don't see a problem with letting them stay there to calm down.

4) The activities felt belittling. Made a lot of patients and myself feel like we're little children. The activities did not teach me any coping skills, it just taught/reminded me that coloring in coloring pages with dull crayons are honestly the most annoying thing ever. However, the karaoke was fun so keep that.

How to fix: Crayons aren't that expensive and I imagine if that is the only writing utensil that patients can write with, you should provide them with non-dull and broken crayons. A coping skill/crisis safety goal is to journal. How can patients journal with broken and dull crayons? You can barely read your own journal entries let alone take your mental health healing seriously when it looks like you're a child writing how you feel and coloring in coloring pages.

Because there's a character limit, I have to keep this short. I have so many more complaints that I can't even comprehend. Like unsanitary bathrooms, abusive doctors, some inconsiderate floor staff, and just everything that made my experience feel like Canyon Ridge is the definition of Malpractice. The staff, doctors, and caseworkers will honestly make you feel dehumanized and belittled. However, the only thing you can truly depend on are other patients. That is your support group, therapy, and sanity. Not anything else.</Review>< user_name>

<review>This place actually discharged one of our clients in a still-psychotic state. ...completely unethical, unprofessional (and amoral). If I could give a negative one star, on this system, I would. The U.S. "sickcare" system is all about the almighty dollar.</review><Date>1503442746644< /Date>< pictures>

I was a patient here for OD on my antidepressant pills. Happened twice and twice I was put into this hospital. First day there I thought it was decent. Staff seemed okay and the food was decent. Then when I came to my senses the next day I realized how terrible this place was. It really did feel like a prison. They don't let you wash your clothes and everyone has to put their name on a list to do their laundry. So everyone basically had to wear dirty clothes for a day or so before they could coax a nurse to open up the laundry room for you. Staff was extremly rude besides the filipino nurse who gave medicine and took the blood pressure thing. She was the best. Everyone else had an attitude like they wanted to leave and didn't want to deal with the patients. I remember overhearing some nurses talking crap about their job. I thought they were supposed to help patients get better. One girl, a roomate of mine and also bulimic, threw up and the nurse who was watching her literally said " thats disgusting. why do you do that. whats the POINT OF EATING." I won't say the nurses name but that alone could be triggering to someone with and eating disorder. I also remember trying to ask the nurses a question so I walked up to their desk where a couple nurses were talking and they completely ignored me. When I finally caught the attention of one he gave me such a petty attitude. I hate it when people act that way especially when their job is to help people recover. The group therapies didn't help but I had to attend them all to get out as soon as possible. It seemed they didn't care unless family was around. But even then they still had a terrible attitude.<//Review>

<text>Terrible in Patient Experience.  It actually felt like torture.  Never slept the whole time I was there, which was 2 weeks.  After they maxed out the insurance, they dumped me at a halfway house in Banning that was an even worse experience.  I would not recommend this place to anyone seeking treatment.  They forced me to take medication I did not want to take.< /text><date>1496075714802</date>< Pics>

<response>None</response><text>I am a minor who has been to this hospital two times because of suicidal thoughts and actions. This place did not help at all, I constantly felt alone and when we were in group to talk about things I was constantly yelled at for not trying, when I had social anxiety in the first place and it was hard  for me to talk to people, I even wrote that down on the paperwork that they told me to fill out when I first got there and they didn't even  acknowledge it.  The second time I went in the first day I was there. The first thing they did was diagnosed me with head lice I was sent to seclusion, with no one to talk to no access to the phone because they were afraid my head lice would get on the phone, and the only interaction I got with doctors was three times a day so I was left alone to sleep in a place that was ment for when someone had an anxiety attack or was triggered and needed to be alone.  I wasn't Let out of that room for days, it was like I was punished for doing nothing, and when I was finally able to talk to a med doctor, she said that I didn't even have lice, just a dry scalp.  Also during my second stay there was one unstable patient who snuck in blades and passed them out for people to use to hurt themselves. Multiple girls were feeling triggered and upset at the site of the blades. It was hard for us to tell the doctors that the girl brought them because we wanted to use them ourselves. Eventually we found out that the girl who was there had hert other people and we were afraid for her to have the blades because she we didn't want any of the other patients getting hurt. We were very disappointed in the staff for not properly checking her, and it scares me knowing that other people can repeat what happened during my stay. They obviously did not properly make sure she didn't have any  contraband.  And the setting at this place is just very depressing, they don't let you do anything you want it's pretty much like a joke it doesn't help at all in group, it is just a bunch of volunteers to come in or nurses who arnt really doctors that help. And sometimes the doctors  won't even show up, one of the girls I was with in the hospital was there for a month and her doctor hadn't showed up for three weeks there was a different doctor she had to talk to you and he wasn't allowed to release her so she was there for even longer just because he wasn't showing up. I would not recommend this place to anyone who is mentally ill and I have been told multiple times by other friends who have been to this hospital and Loma Linda that Loma Linda Hospital is a better program. I would recommend probably going there instead if you are planning to go in for treatment.  Also one more thing, I'm a vegetarian and I told him that multiple times but they kept on disregarding that. They let you bring in outside food orders but my mom was in able to bring me an outside food, so I was stuck just eating bread and water basically for a while sometimes vegetables but not really anything with protein.< /text><user_id>101742489336611669137< /user_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< Time>

i was here on a 72 hour hold in the adolescent ward after an OD and im mad about the "service" i was provided. Some staff were supportive, and some blatantly ignored me.i would go up to the nurses station to ask for something while two nurses were talking, and even though i would be evidently wanting to talk to one of them, they would keep talking, for up to seven minutes!! what kind of respect is that? The staff obviously musnt've checked the patients bags thoroughly enough because people had sharp pieces of plastic and pencils for self harm use. it was very triggering when they did that, and they did it in the public lounge. and i was on prozac when i was there and they completely took me off it without even talking to me about it. in the middle of my stay i tried to slit my wrists, and i was caught doing it, so they put me in seclusion for the rest of my stay, which was the most awful thing. a dark room with a tiny window and n air circulation. i wasnt allowed to talk to anyone. it made me so panicked, and when i asked politely if i could just sit out in front of the nurses station, so i could breathe, i was yelled at for sticking my head out of the door. i only had one consultation with my doctor and one with my therapist, and each was about 5 minutes long. THIS PLACE SUCKS DONT LET YOUR KIDS GO HERE< /review>

<review>It's not that bad but then it's not that good... I was forced into this hospital against my own will because of my stupid ass school. But anyways, most of the nurses were pretty freaking chill and #TEAMTATIANNA AiiGHT lol. I kinda learned about how the mental hospital of this place (well at least in Unit 1) works. The mental health workers have it easy, but more physical work since they have to run rounds and do stuff to sometimes accommodate the patients' needs such as toiletries and such. They were basically the eyes, nose, mouths, and bodies for the nurses while the charge nurses, LVNs, RNs, and Med nurses were the brains of the unit I actually bonded and formed really strong bonds with some of the mental health workers! They inspired me to become a part time mental health worker to some job in that field one day if becoming an optometrist fails lol. I really miss some of the staff and friends there. However, I hate that there were some rotten apples within the staff and how they're in a way more strict, yet not that strict because so many girls be going into rooms that aint theres andddd how boys and girls are separated. Some of the nursing staff especially CHELSEA AND THE HUMPTY DUMPTY GIRL THAT WORKS GRAVEYARD SHIFT OMMGAWWWD THEY KINDA MEAN AND RUDE. I felt like whenever i wanted to get soemtihng they were just like UGHHHH we gotta deal with this. I felt like i was unimportant since there were only so few mental healthh workers while there was like 50 girls and 8 boys. So it was kind of overwhelming for the nurses, therefore they'd get agitated really easily. I'd suggest that they have at least 2 extra mental health workers working so that it can be a little stressless. Oyeah! and it was so easy for EVERYONE to sneak food or whatever into their rooms... What i really hated was the special probation ( special program) and how little they let us go outside and get soem fresh air because being in this hospital only stressed me out more. And the reason i was sent here was because i was feeling frustrated one day so i wanted to see a psychiatrist but instead they sent me here and to this very moment of my discharged day, I still have not been able to talk to anyone.. ANYWAYS some nurses and mental health workers were so rad, while others were so fREAKING SASSY AND MEAN. But on a positive note, food was bomb SOMETIMES. AND THEY HAVE A KARAOKE, GYM, ANNNNND AUTOMATIC FLUSHING TOILET OMGOD!!! I was sad there aint no toilet seat covers... i clogged the toilet once because i used towels as my seat LOL. I even dropped a whole roll of toilet paper down the toilet HAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHAHA. kay anyways this hospital is not that bad. It's soemwhat better than College Hospital in Cerritos since the janitors clean it every day and its more spacious and has a better atmosphere while at cerritos the atmosphere was kinda bleak and cold. Over here it felt warm especially when everyone was happy(: I really hope i can work here one day as a mental health worker!!!!(: #kaylana #somewheeeeerovatherainb0w #pilipinopamilyporeber #TEAMTATIANNA #pansitislype AYYYYY</review><GmapID>0x80c333287ae06061:0xd88d80f39b5aafe5< /GmapID><Date>1425188016138<//Date>< Pictures>

<Review>I came here as a patient because of my pride, I studied the occult gnostic lies & practiced many sins I had a reprobate mind I was seeing everything I wanted to see and I felt I was Jesus they would not provide me the KJV my roommate in room 111 was speaking in tongues & the devil tried to tempt me I was stuck there until I repented was there for 7 days but it felt like 3 months the lord was working with me spiritually and mentally call on the name of Jesus Christ and repent and ye shall be saved, just as in the days of noah so shall when the son of God returns</Review>< Pictures>

<text>This place sucks everything you read about this place on them just putting holds on children to keep them there is true. Dr's never call you back and then a dr that is only there on the weekend and only sees your child one time has the right to all of a sudden put your child on a 14 day hold with out even knowing any circumstances or even knowing your child. I really think this place needs to be under investigation. Or shut down</text><GmapID>0x80c333287ae06061:0xd88d80f39b5aafe5<//GmapID>< user>

<review>The staff was rude, besides a select few. With almost 30 adolescent girls staying in the hospital together, group therapies were of no help. They say that they have a wide spectrum of services for mental illnesses, but in reality, they just prescribe you medicine, with barely any thought or question. Do not stay here, unless you want your illness to get worse</review>< pictures>

When ypu call all the do is transfer you to the unit that never picks up. My Son has been there a week and we have pleaded the one time we talked to someone that we need to provide his job with a letter and nobody has helped us. They don't care if he loses his job
. Im currently looking for a lawyer to see what we can do. Do not take your love one here or you will not be able to get information. I am also gonna put complaints everywhere I can.</review>< pics>

I go here on Tuesdays for their BOGO on the bone-in wings!
Can't beat that deal.
They also have potato wedges and fried pickle chips!
80 TV's to watch your favorite sport team.   It does get
loud and lively!<//review>

My daughter and I are traveling around northern California and stopped for lunch, a fair price range for both hefty and light eaters.  The service was pleasant. Our waitress was helpful.  They have wings down...it was good.< /text>

Our server was attentive and everything was correct and tasty.. our only complaint was the appetizer came out the same time as our entree's which for obvious reasons was a little frustrating.</review>

<Name>Bory Than</Name><Text>I was there on Saturday and there was only one waitress serving the bar area and she was also the bartender. But the real issue was waiting for our food it took little over an 1 hour... it was ridiculous!!!. It was not like we have a big order or a big group. Just me and my BF, So overall WORST experience for dining in.<//Text></record>

Took my nephew for his birthday and the staff refused to seat us for 54 minutes because they were favoring those already seated during the NBA Draft.

Asked for a take home order instead and they said 15 minutes but took 3 orders out to tye SAME people who had been seated for over an hour.<//Text>

Ordered online and they forgot some of my my food, I was upset because it was food the kids had ordered! I always check my food, but this time I was in a hurry and I was tired from a longs day work, so I didn't realize we didn't have all of our order, but when I called in and explained to them what had happened, I had no problem with them offering a refund to my card, which was awesome.<//Text>

This is a great place to bring your family. It is a little pricey. For 3 people...mac and cheese,all American burger, and the grilled chicken wrap with the medium order of traditional wings and a snack size wings to go; $75. The service was good, and so was the food. Next time happy hour might be fun.<//Text>

<text>Don't really eat wings but this place was awesome. Drinks were nice and the wings were delicious. We went on a Tuesday so there was an hour long wait for food, but it was also buy 1 get 1 free night. So that was understandable. Lots of flavors to choose from.<//text>< resp>

Heck they didn't even mind when we realized that we just wanted some drinks and decided to go home and cook something there instead. Not too many places are so cordial feeling anymore and it's that utterly relaxed vibe there that I love.

The service was good, restaurant itself and the bathrooms were clean. The food was very average. The wings were over cooked and very dry. Allot of drummettes had barely any meat on them. The sauce was also not distributed properly, with some wings almost naked. My kids had the hand breaded chicken tenders, which were very good. The food wasn't terrible, just wasn't great.<//Text>

Been coming here for awhile now because I love their mango habanero flavor on the wings. I feel like applying here just to flip the way their workers perform. Wish management would take time to train or even emphasize the importance of customer service.</text>

We placed our order we received our food we had three side dishes the wing for cold I had to get my own water and and napkins also we had to ask where was the salad and it look like it was left over.
When I asked the waitress do you serve them cold she should know I'm sorry for that walked off.
I thought I was going to enjoy myself there to see the game we finished our drinks paid our bill and and lift can even finish watching the game I was so upset...</review>

Had to pick up an order (door dash) with multiple beverages. BWW does not provide drink holders. The one star is for the nice employee who helped me to my car with them.  Thank you.< /Text>

The best service you'll get is sitting at the bar but literally every time I am there I ask for extra sauce on my wing and they come out super dry like they are running out of sauce. Get it together BWW<//Review>

This is a good spot if you like watching sports. Restaurant is surrounded with big screen tvs.Food is very good too, likely there specialty is chicken wings, but you have lots of other choices. They  also open late< /Text>

<text>You can never go wrong with wings. They have an array of flavors. With bone-in and boneless options. Their food too Is great. Good kids menu. What goes best with wings is beer! Ice cold brews in tap. Good variety to choose from. Decent selection of mixed drinks too. Friendly staff and environment. I recommend this place for sure.</text>< Pictures>

Delicious food friendly service. Took a bit too long for my food though.. overall pretty good. Very clean inside and out... Other than the  Parking lot, had broken glass scattered  with trash maybe someone should be keeping it clean? To end on a good note, if you like the sauces they serve on the food they have it bottled so you can buy it and take some home! Genius!</Review>

Been coming here for the past 9 years. 9 years its indeed a lot of time. It has its good times to ckme and bad times. Bad times its mostly because of all of the costumers coming in at the same time and they take longer to get the food out. But at times when theres barely anyone and theres no games on tv, service is fast and not rushed.<//review>

Got there and the new girl messed up my order (i get it shes still learning) and I brought it back and the manager had a fresh meal made for me and included all the things they hadnt given me before at no extra charge. They probably have a high turnover rate so it doesnt surprise me that employees make mistakes but the managers are extremely well trained at this BDubs.< /Text>

The bathroom stalls are very nice. Definitely a place I would go to hide from my enstranged uncle as he drunkenly stumbles through the building in an attempt to find me and force feed me their hottest hot sauce at our family reunion.< /Review>

This is a good spot if you like watching sports. Restaurant is surrounded with big screen tvs.Food is very good too, likely there specialty is chicken wings, but you have lots of other choices. They  also open late</Text>

The service is so horrible to the point of waiting is beyond unreasonable I don't understand why they take so long this is my second time coming and every time it seems the cooks take forever to get our food. Buffalo wild wings is beyond. I'm so dissatisfied!!!! Then when I got my food my wings were extremely cold not even hot. I had to complain to the manager before and after im so furious I will never come here again. This store needs HELP and more proper training.</text>

I wish I could rate 0. One of most dirty places I have ate in the US. My wife and I went for dinner. They kept us waiting for about 50 minutes, then they said they lost the list of names. Then waiter dropped sauce on me. Quesadilla was really bad with rotten lattuce and what not. I am fan of Buffalo Wild Wings, but I think the reputation of Buffalo Wild Wings is harmed by its Stockton branch. I will definitely avoid this next time.< /Text>

<review>Food was good. However I called in my order then still had to wait well over a half hour past my pick up time for my food.  The poor guy at the register was working his butt off while other servers and a manager either played with their cell phones or stood and watched the room.  If it was a busy night I would understand but it wasn't.  No reason for it to take over an hour for a small wing and onion rings</review>< pics>

<review>When  first went there it was pretty good. Decided to make it a regular visit. After awhile it just started going downhill. This last time I decided we will not return. The place was noisy so we went outside where it was still noisy though not painfully so. We got there at 1:30 we were promptly served alcohol and then waited we could not talk it was still too loud. We got the food at 3:00. The wings were still pretty good but my wife received a salad that was closer to compost than fresh and was swimming in a puss like substance. She did not eat it. I think it might be a fine place if you want to drink and watch the game. Eat before you go and plan on doing little visiting.< /review>< Pics>

Service was fine. Seating was good with lots of use of big screens. Food was okay but menu was lame. I wanted coffee but they had no creamer. Grocery store is right across the parking lot. Lame. Wanted soup. Soup is listed on the menu but not carried at that restaurant. It is carried at other restaurants so that's why it's on the menu. Lame. Out of Philly cheese steak because there's no more meat. What, no other meat you can use? Lame. And they weren't even busy.</Review>

Horrible service. Very slow staff. Waited over 30 minutes just to order and another 30 to get our food, but the food was cold and the carrots were warm. Never coming back again.< /review>

Kind of a let down, was excited about having wings, a beer and enjoying the game...two out of three ain't bad but really disappointed with the wings. The wings were dry and luke warm, even the celery and carrots looked like they'd been prepared a day ago. Waitress was great, very understanding but clearly there are quality issues here...<//text>

The lack of service is what killed this Buffalo Wild Wings for myself and several work friends.

We ( 8 people in total) arrived at 10 PM to a slightly packed house for a Tuesday night. After getting seating in the Bar Area we sat and conversed as we waited for menus and a server to come by for drink orders.

After 5 minutes of sitting and waiting we grabbed a menu and decided on which foods to order to help when the server came up to get drink orders. We figured help the server and the kitchen along at the same time instead of the time delay waiting for the drinks and ordering.

After a few more minutes, a friend decided to set a timer and see how long it would take for someone to come over and acknowledge us.

After 10 minutes on the timer ( at this point 17 or so minutes had passed) a server came up with menus and told us he would back to take our orders.

5 minutes later ( roughly 23 minutes since we had sat) and no server came by. We got up and left as a server came rushing up to "check on us".

Sorry BWW if this is the service to be expected, then sadly you will not see us here again.

Please be mindful people and call ahead to ensure it is not too busy otherwise what happened to us may happen to you< /review>

*Reccomended = Its a Gamble*
08/24/19 1:30pm

Service: Good: Was greeted at the door and sat down pretty fast in a clean booth. Waitress, was sufficient in her work, helped us decide on what we wanted to order and was constant on visiting our table.

Food:
Wings: Delicious and fresh, could use a little work on distributing the big wings and small wings evenly.
Salad: Bad, if I wanted 5 day old salad I'd go to walmart pick up a salad and wait 5 days to eat it. Could use some work on dating your food and making sure it is all ServSafe Compliant.

Cleanliness: While being seated there were quiet a few tables that have not been busted. If it were busy I would understand, but it was a slow with 2 maybe 3 tables with 2 - 4 people each.
Floor: Semi dirty I asked the waitress if it were busy she said it was a semi slow day. Could use some work on making sure the tables and floors are cleaned and ready to be used when a rush does come.

Environment: Great, I had a great time hanging with my mother.

Having over 12 years of Customer/Food/Restaurant/Managerial experience & with a Manager Food Safe Certificate. The thing I'm most concerned about was the salad, if the salad doesnt look safe to eat what other foods do you guys have that is not servsafe compliant?< /review>

The wait was a bit long. Our server Savannah was gracious and always had a smile on her face when I requested for a slice of lemon.  We ordered a large and medium order of traditional wings, plus a bleu cheese burger with sodas and an ice tea.  Was a bit surprised with the bill of $71.88.  I now know why I dont go often to BWW. -- quite pricey.< /text>

<text>Wings , wings , wings ... you pick the amount and the flavor .
They have a full bar and bar area .
sports on the Many TVs that hung around the walls . Not that you’ll hear any of them cause the music they ply is quite loud , I been there several times and it is always very loud .
They are open late so it’s a good place to get some late night food not only wings they have other selections if you don’t want just wings . The staff was friendly.<//text>< Rate>

We sat here tonight for 13mins until someone said "I'll be right with you" we were sitting at out table for 34minutes until we got our first drink. Took about 20mins after ordering to get any beer. Just overall bad service and slow employees. Just for reference we were in the bar area there were only 6 tables including us with people and she said "sorry there's only 2 of us" 1 person with 6 tables shouldn't even be difficult.</review><Rate>1</Rate><time>1562047247923< /time><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<review>I came here with a couple of coworkers late at night and the place is cool and hip. The food was really good, I personally tried the avocado cheese burger and it was wonderful. However, not the best service. Everything was going fine I mean we were stared down a bit at the entrance but nothing peculiar or out of the ordinary.  They took a little while to take drinks but we weren't inpatient. They brought the order out wrong, rootbeers instead of coke, dr pepper instead of sprite. We were all so tired we just ended up swapping drinks. Three of us got burgers and we all got it all mixed up as well, regular onions instead of grilled, onions insted of no onions. Once again we were all so hungry and tired that we ended up just eating it like that, it was still pretty good. As we finished we were just talking and hanging out and the waiter kept coming along almost pressuring us to leave till finally she told us we had to pay because she needed to leave as her shift was ending.  We stood up to leave and pay. I understand that she needed to leave but it was a bit embarrassing and she did tell us we could still go sit down after paying but it was kinda humiliating to do so. Anyways the food was still pretty good so I'd still come back for that.<//review><Date>1554694324626</Date><user>114265393130606863679<//user></record></dataset><record>

<text>It was my first time trying this place on saturday, went here with a female friend we ordered a plate of wings and some sides. The hot wings were so dry they looked old for sure. The other 2 flavors were fine. But id rather go to wingstop where the wings are made to order and its cheaper. Buffalo wild wings charges more for old wings. No thanks, the waitress was nice tho< /text>< response>

My family and I go at least twice a month on Tuesdays. The staff always greet us with a smile and try their best to seat us on our favorite table. The staff remembered my kids order and call it in before we even have a seat at the table. We love the staff and the food.</review>

<review>Always have issues with being seated. One time, we were the only people in there and took us 20 minutes for them to seat us. The last time it took 45 minutes. People that were waiting to be sat walked out, others were getting upset. At one point we counted 10 tables that sat dirty and other that was wiped down 5 times by 5 different employees including the manager. Food is always good, but service is horrible.</review></record></dataset><record>

Nasty n way 2 pricey for some chicken i could make better at home. And never order a drink it took as long as the chicken for me 2 get a long island ice tea. And our waitress sucked. I will never ever ever go back again and i suggest you save your money. You will be better off going to Popeye's 😆 but frfr< /text>

Fantastic place to eat for any occasion, unfortunately I must give 4 stars because of the HORRIBLE menu redesign that makes finding any item a chore, great place but I might go a little less just to avoid that menu.</review>

Waited for a very long time to be seated and parties coming in after me were seated before... waited at the booth for over 20 minutes and were not even offered our drinks. Requested to call the manager on my way out and he was not courtious, did not offer a new service or an apology. Horrible service!!!<//review>

I'm definitely going to spend some Sundays at Buffalo Wild Wings. Love the atmosphere. If your a sports fan and need a place to catch the games, it is definitely the place to go.</Text><userid>104867953070081378615<//userid>< resp>

It's ok. It's wings and beers. It's nice for after work or with the friends, possibly to pregame with food, but ultimately it's a sports bar. It's loud and it takes forever to get your ticket to leave. The staff are super friendly though. Also, try the street tacos.<//Review>

<Review>Great food. But on a weeknight we chose main dining area instead of the noisy bar (very loud pumped music) and the service was very slow. We were ready to order when the server first came to our table, but it took 45 minutes to get food.< /Review></record>

They tend to take long even when they arent busy...also dont recomend their shakes or cheescake bites. But the wings are good! (Edited) just came back another day to see if the service would be the same.....my server literally sat at a table with people she knew. I looked at all the other tables she was serving and like mine once our cups got low they weren't refilled. Very disappointed that not even the manager saw his employee not doing their job. Wont be coming back to this one!!! All in all the food is good but the coustomer service is very poor!<//Review>

The epitome of chain restaurant hell. Why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we continuously fall victim to the same boring, monotonous routine. Are we not creative enough to venture out and explore different options? If you visit here, you deserve to be bored by mediocre quality food, watered down drinks, and talentless staff.< /Text>

The "manager" Jim and server named Jennifer are extremely rude and unprofessional. Jennifer lost my debit card and was frantically looking for it all over the place and tried to accuse me of never handing it to her in there first place. They must have  been drinking  or doing drugs on the job who knows? After looking throughout the restaurant myself, my son found it on the floor completely in the opposite direction  from where we we're seating! When I  complained to the "manager" Jim he was unapologetic and even   allowed Jennifer to laugh in my face. When asked what was funny and why they were laughing. They were both extremely sarcastic with a smerk on their face and basically told me I was lieing and that she had never lost my card and that I never handed it to her.I was completely baffeled and lost for words  so therefore just walked out and decided I would call in and complain the next morning.  It's now been over  a week and I am still waiting from a call back from the General Manager.
I will never be going there again and will make sure everyone knows about my horrible experience</review>

<Text>I don't know what it is, but I've ordered my food twice through Doordash.  Both times the delivery person is waiting longer than usual for my food to be prepared.   It seems BWW doesn't cook the food until wayyyy after the driver arrives to the restaurant.  Also, I only received 8 wings - for $12!  Too expensive for too little.  And my drink wasn't even filled to the top.  If I order a large,  32oz drink, that's exactly what I should've received.  I will not be doing service with BWW anymore.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

They take very long to get service to you. From asking if you want water to getting food from take out... be sure it will take you 40 mins guaranteed for some service regardless.< /Text>

< Review>
Called in a takeout order for one of their salads and requested that extra lettuce be added.  I have made such requests in the past without incident.  However, when I arrive to pick up my order, the cashier informs me that she "asked the manager" and my request could not be honored.  The salads here are flavorful, but very small, so I was extremely unhappy.  When I called to ask to speak with the manager, he had to call me back.  Once he did, he asserted that he never informed his staff that a request for extra lettuce could not be honored.  I don't know who to believe, but I do know that I will be taking my business elsewhere.< /Review>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>They tend to take long even when they arent busy...also dont recomend their shakes or cheescake bites. But the wings are good! (Edited) just came back another day to see if the service would be the same.....my server literally sat at a table with people she knew. I looked at all the other tables she was serving and like mine once our cups got low they weren't refilled. Very disappointed that not even the manager saw his employee not doing their job. Wont be coming back to this one!!! All in all the food is good but the coustomer service is very poor!< /Review>< Time>

The cooks need to add more sauce to the wings.

The last time I came here for a to go order. I was second in line and my food was cold. I called a manager and he only credited 20 dollars on a 90 dollar meal. I think his name was Darren.</Review>

Me and my friend went on a late sunday to buffalo in march ln and  it was not busy we seat on the bar area and the serves dont come at all to out seats and they ignore us... I ask the server name “Alex” he has green eyes and its tall. We been seating here for 10 minutes and then he says everyone else is, and he say there is a wait and he walks away. If he is a server he should be more attentive and nice and at least get the menus and not ignore us too. He was rude! He ruined the night!! If he is not happy in the workplace then he needs to apply to other jobs.</review>

Good food and atmosphere, but it's usually a long wait for food and they always forget to bring my appetizer before my food. I usually have to ask for a drink refill too. But, I continue to revisit BDubs time & time again. I just have to set my expectations before I go.</Text>

<review>I love the food over here! The only issue I do have is the service itself. I've waited nearly an hour after being seated on multiple occasions before my order was taken, which ends up being an extreme inconvenience. If it wasn't for the fact that I really do like the food, I probably wouldn't frequent this place often.<//review><Date>1469115635461< /Date>< rating>

Buffalo wild wings has been the same at every location I've visited. I feel like they are all the same which is nice. I suggest the Asian zing sauce on your wings. Sort of sweet sort of zippy. Big daddy Jack burger is massive if you're hungry. It has pulled pork on top of the pattie. They do Pepsi products so coke drinkers be warned. They can get pretty busy depending on the season but there is always some sort of sport playing on the tv's. UFC, NFL, NBA, WNBA, NHL, MLB, and all the other ABC's< /text>

When I came here, the place was over crowded, I was seated on a bad seat at the full bar (I think it was a kids seat), and had to wait too long for everything.

Also, being from out of the country, when I showed a passport as an ID that made a mini scene which I found to be rude, not a tourist friendly place.

the food is not great, and the prices are not cheap, I wouldn't come here again.<//text>

Some times theyre great, other times the wings are  very dry with a bit of watery sauce at the bottom. The last 2 times ive ordered extra sauce, the first time I though they actually listen but I think I just got lucky, because agian, even after asking for extra sauce, my wings are dry.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rate>

We waited for 10 minutes and did not get our menu until we had to ask for it. We then waited another 40 minutes and still were not served. This was probably due to sitting outside. In addition, there were other people that were served next to us and the waitress ignored us when we asked if we can order. Probably will not come here again. Very bad experience.< /text>

<text>I'm 32, came in with my family and they wouldn't serve me a beer cause my I'd was expired. I asked if someone who was 70 came in with an expired I'd would they serve them, no we wouldn't sir. Lol anyways thank you for be the only restaurant or bar that has refused to give me a beer in the last 2 months, use common sense.</text>< rating>

Super super super poor service. Got there around 9:30 p.m. and no one greet's us until five minutes after and bad waiter an waitress took too long just to get the drinks took about 15 minutes just to get a french fries appetizer took about 5 minute just for a refIl on drink took about 20 minutes just for a burger an some wings. Really poor service well not be going there no more because it hapen to me 3 to 4 times already  I advise people don't go there< /Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>Kitchen staff (the ones that brought us our food) was very friendly and pleasant, but the waiter/waitressing staff was horrible and need to be replaced.  Service was slow, we almost had to tackle them to get our drinks refilled and they didn't get our order correct.  Not to mention they left a ranch spill smothered all over the floor for the entire time we were there watching our game  It takes a lot for me to leave a bad tip but they didn't even deserve the 5% tip I left.  Will never be going there again.  Worse BWW I have ever been to.<//Text>< Rating>

Very bad service didn't get anybody to get us drinks or anything we sat for a while before someone finally came. Ranch spilled all over my husband and waitress did not even say anything and walked of winking at other customers to not say anything it was so wrong and humiliating and they are treating us like we did something. And she didn't apologize or anything. Manager acted like it was not a big deal at all. It was the worst service I ever had and they are so inconsiderate<//Review>

<text>I took Russell and Ruby into Buffalo Wild Wings, my FAVORITE place, so that they could experience it for the FIRST TIME!  They are now Wildlings, like me lol! Can't wait to go back again. Clean, and full of fun, friendly staff and they all seem to love working there. The only thing that happened, was a young woman running her mouth, saying mean races stuff, trying to start a fight. In front of a lot of little children! ! Thankfully, everyone was so busy eating AWESOME food and having too much fun, to take the girls bait lol! Keep up with the great work guys, and Thank you BWW!<//text>< Pictures>

The lack of service here was absolutely ridiculous. I waited 1 hour they brought everybody's food and forgot mine . Then I had to wait another 30 minutes and my burger was cold when it got there. 90 minutes ?!?! That's unheard of< /text>

<Review>This review is written in regards to the customer service that is provided at this location, speficially. First and foremost, the is little to no controll over how guest are managed, seated, and attended. Hence, the chaos at the enterance of the store. I cannot seem to comprehend why there were so many open tables and booths, yet at least twenty people were standing at the door waiting to be seated: keep in mind the booths/tables open were able to fit large groups or arranged to fit a large group. The waitress seem to have little to no respect among each other, and a few are not friendly. One for example seemed to be irrated by my party, and acted as a complete a** hole. The manager of the store was spoken to, and I hope this location improves as their food is good: not great, but good. I would no recommend this location to anyone as it is unfriendly, unorganized, and dirty (to an extent).< /Review>< userid>

Gave 3 stars because they had us waiting when there were a bunch of empty tables. We stayed and had our food and had to tell the waitresses to remove the empty plates
From the table. It wasn't busy and thought the sevice could have been better.<//Text>

We got lost in the busyness of playoff game 7 Cabs vs Warriors.  Order not cooked for 1.5 hours. And customer service was low also. Their staff was watching game instead of serving< /text>

Last visit had poor service again.  Waited 15 minutes after being sat at table before server came by.  Management stood in the doorway watching people smoke near the outside doors and did nothing.  Also frequently very loud.< /review>

The buffalo wing lemon pepper tasted good to the Japanese tongue.
Mango Habanero is extremely spicy.
