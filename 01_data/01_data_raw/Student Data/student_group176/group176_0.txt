I drove around all day trying to get tires and couldn't find them in the size I needed came here and they gave me a great price on new ones for almost the same as used. Gentleman in the front is so nice and friendly sometimes that's all you need to be is nice and you can get a sale.</Text>

I got a flat yesterday and gave these guys a call they said to come on down. Went in and it couldn’t have been easier. They got me 2 real nice tires at a very good price and it took only about 20 minutes. Highly recommended these guys for y’all’s tire trouble.</text>

Definitely don't buy tires from these guys I bought four tires for my trailer they told me that these were great tires and I had a 3-year warranty. Two years I've had the tires on here and the side walls were bubbling out. That's usually due to the make of the tire/or a bad batch for that year. I took the tire in and they told me that they couldn't get their money back from the manufacture so wanted to charge me cost to replace the one tire. So I was trying to keep business good I bought the one tire put it back on the trailer got it to my destination and the other tire started bubbling out and separating from the rim.When I told him about it he said it's not my problem oh well I can't get my money back from the manufacturer on those tires. As I walked around the trailer I noticed the other tires are starting to do the same thing really just a big disappointment cuz I was trying to be cool with it little shop here. So I will now adventure down to American tire and get four new tires. My recommendation is do not buy from tire zone at all customer service blows. And they do not know how to stand behind their tires or warranties.< /Text>

< Review>
Initially I was happy with my experience here. I spent over one thousand dollars on 6 tires for my dually truck. Come to find out, they did not mount the tires correctly. They put the unfinished side of my wheels facing inwards, leaving the unfinished dull side of the wheels facing out. The reason that they did this - the finished side of my wheel was damaged upon mounting the wheel on the tire with the machine. I did not realize this until weeks later. When I brought my truck back with the problem, the manager that works on Saturday, told me that they did not cause the damage to my wheel, and that I had to wait 2 hours to even address the issue. This is not true, because nobody has touched my tires or wheels since, and the damaged part of my wheel was faced inward, eliminating possible damage. This was on a Saturday, the owner was not at the tire shop at the time. The manager told me to leave and go do something and come back in 2 hours. I am now leaving and will pay someone I trust to fix the issue. I will not continue to come here unless contacted by the owner. Hope my review helps you in choosing a place to purchase tires. I would recommend Americas Tire in Glendora as an alternative.</Review>

Its the last place serving in town before only 24/7 flyers. So, for my late night needs, its a last minute score on whatever i need to get through till next day. Its clean, Its quick, Employee friendly, Has more merchandise than most gas stations. It is convenient to find toys and other gadgets, or auto and house supplies, Food and drink, Snacks abd alcohol, and most importantly Cigarettes and Gas.< /text>

Open pretty late, decent quality gas, average fuel cost, and has a taco truck outside now. sometimes, when paying for gas inside, you have to wait because of only one register usually being open.< /Text>

We were in a walk with our two dogs and decided we wanted something to drink so we stopped at patriot. I waited out side with my two dogs that were not even making sounds walkin a lil and sittin down. My husband went in and they waited until AFTER we bought our stuff. Our dogs harness needed fixed before we left and literally right as my husband walks up to us we were told we have to leave we can be there.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80838bc799ddf919:0x99919b8109e21d9e<//GmapID></record>

<review>Ok, my husband and I were really excited about trying out this Dutch Bros Coffee.  We have traveled quite a bit and had seen Dutch Bros before, up North.  The cups with the little blue windmills are cute and so are the little shops. However, we ordered 3 separate drinks so we could try a variety.  One was supposed to be just a cup of coffee with breve (cream), one was a mocha grasshopper with creme de mint, and the third was a sugar-free, vanilla cold brew made with almond milk. Sounds good, right?  Well, my reason for 3 stars, right here, all 3 drinks were so watered down we could barely taste ANY coffee at all!  They were precisely like flavored water!  In other words, I'm sorry, but they were terrible!  Now, if this were just one drink, I would chalk it up as a mistake, but this was 3 drinks!  As for all the people that say this is better than Starbucks or anyone that enjoys coffee, this incredibly weak is most likely not a true coffee drinker and most likely loads their regular coffee with tons of sugar. Yes, Starbucks is not the world's best coffee. It's not even my favorite.  I order coffee from places like Seattle and Jamaica, to name a few. Still, if you've ever been to Europe or other places globally and had coffee, it's basically straight espresso, and you wouldn't be crying about how strong Starbucks was anymore. For us, we would rather stick to drinking actual real coffee instead of water with a bit of coffee flavoring.  I think most younger people would instead drink sugary laden drinks rather than a real cup of coffee, so this will be a good place for them, and for that, I would highly recommend it for all of the unique special drinks Dutch Bros has to offer.  I will say it's probably best not to compare it to a regular coffee shop because they are two different things.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZz7h_ZHW26B-deghxLi9yYZE4utZpNYtjnZuJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM68wYGRF-XyhL4UMfciC6II05vrRL26wX4so_5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOyURh21ptB5Ob9Zq6kg-3fQ-LMwtQkIlJF1Pe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyNRvImpHvuf3Kodn7FHI4DC3vIcLR68rwDvQn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOP7C3AXYGd6Qg3XSCOBIjQzcA77RD_O7aj_B7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>New in town so I was excited to check it out.   (I remember the yummy flavored freezes from the Dutch Bros up north.)   I ordered the Annihilator with an extra shot of espresso and it was pretty strong!  But the Palm Beach tea was really good and my coworkers L❤VED the freeze. I downloaded the app and already earned a free drink so I'll definitely go back and try new things.   Worth trying a few times!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaHn18ampRD0XSCcsACcCZQHF9REn3-6_dzZU4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTRnX5aFlTWPgf8Xt5HgmlcVhQ74hgCbeM6BqX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtqhr7uIJOLuS3J4w10U5KHqeV7SFl3nqZHXol=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFcuqJdRi_m0xPi4wKW1PVtfQDp5H3T5HI9exu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>{'time': 1623006613709, 'text': 'Hi there!

I was so happy to visit this coffee shop. I’ve never been to a Dutch Bros before so this was my first experience. The drive through line was very long so we did walk up- glad we did because we were helped right away and the guy who took our order was friendly.

I ordered the Dutch classic caramelizer which was yummy- but not amazing. I ordered a small because their medium size is 24 Oz. My partner ordered a frozen caramel latte because he doesn’t like mocha - he ended up actually liking my drink more even though the caramelizer has mocha.

In the future I would like try one of their ‘energy drinks’. The woman in front of us ordered a ‘shark attack’ drink and it looked delicious.< /text>

<text>I ordered a cake batter frost and all I got was milk in a cup. No sprinkle, no caramel..just soup. A frost is supposed to be thick not runny.</text>< Pictures>

First time there with my family and the service was great. Gave recommendations for those who didn’t know what to get and was quick with the drinks. Plus amazing drinks, everybody was happy and would come back again< /Review>

While waiting in line I seen 9 people get out of their cars to move cones to leave the line. The workers are not friendly. They don't greet you they are so rude, when we went to the window you see employees drinking drinks and they look so miserable and they give dirty looks and it seams like they do t know what they are doing. They messed Up 4 drinks out of 6, and the 2 that was fine was kids drinks.. I really hope they can get the owner to fix this problem..< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1627595410631, 'text': "Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.

<Text>Always like Dutch Bros coffee over other drive thru coffee chains in the high desert. They are friendlier, faster and have more sugar free choices that flat out taste better.  Their just black coffee has a better flavor and smell than their competitor next door.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>The drinks were delicious but I'm really not a fan of how the employees were forced to stand outside in over 100° heat to take orders. With other restaurants that do this, they provide shade, fans, and water for their workers. It was really upsetting to see and I hope that this changes because it seems very exploitative and dangerous for people to be outside in such heat for extended periods of time.< /review><Response>{'time': 1624386136908, 'text': 'Thanks for leaving a review!

Coffee is flavorful and you can actually taste the coffee in your drink not like other places where all you taste is the syrups. Good location as well.</text>

Went there earlier today and I must say it’s still way better than Starbucks. The service and energy of the employees is very refreshing and welcoming. I got the caramelizer? w/ a soft top and it was sooooo good!! Definitely going there to get my coffee. Oh also! The line was so long it wrapped around the building and down to the end of the parking lot but the staff cleared everybody in like 15 mins. It was amazing!< /Review>

The restaurant was refereed to me from a friend and I was excited to try their food for the first time.  I placed my order on their kiosk, which has a overly simplistic layout. I requested “no coleslaw” because I do not like mayonnaise.  My order came out with a mayo sauce on everything and I brought it to the staff’s attention.  The lady told me that I needed to look at the picture on their display board to understand that there’s a secret sauce on my order.  I told her that the sauce should be listed on the menu and I asked if they were able to replace the order.  I only ordered 2 items.  The lady refused my request because they just made the order.  The only option offered to me was to issue a refund and that was that. It was literally a waste of time to even go here.  Their staff should be more accommodating, especially over a request so small. Please go somewhere else.<//Review>

Spicy as heck 😂 and I like spicy, but I think I’m better off with the original spicy. Took one bite and my tongue was instantly on fire. Fries are deliciously seasoned. I also love the fact that you can get AN ENTIRE PICKLE! 👏🏼<//text>

Apparently you have to pay but there no sign saying to pay for parking and he will come up to you in a rude manner while your eating and demand you pay for parking. But he is not part of the food place.< /review>< Rating>

Overall rating 4 out of 5. Had ordered milk chicken sandwich and the sandwich was 5 out of 5. So delicious and amazing flavors from chicken and cabbage. The fries in the other hand was 3 out of 5 too much seasoning. Overpowering the meal overall. But would for sure recommend this location just order with light seasoning on the fries. Would post a pic but once tasted the chicken I devoured it.<//text>

Fast service, decent seating area, parking is limited. Very flavorful food. Good portion. Canned soda and bottled waters. No fountain drinks, spicy enough without ordering spicy or hot. Fried are good. Chicken is moist and crispy!< /Review>

They are scrumptiously delicious. Chicken burger is crispy and spicy, but good spicy.  Cannot go wrong with the Honey Orange choice, on anything.
Fries are rich and tasty.
This is a MUST try place in Ktown.< /Review>

The tenders are juicy and flavorful with the spices they rub them with and just how meaty they are they do not dissapoint the fries especially were a great addition this place knows how to cook but I suggest being patient and taking your time here cause the wait is worth it<//Text>

<Review>Delicious fried chicken wings, sandwich, or nuggies. The spiciness is only matched by the well crafted seasoning. I also like the peach iced tea but always wish I had more to drink.</Review>< user>

<Review>I love spicy and their 'Hot' is just the right sting for me. When the food comes out it feels like you're getting fresh pair of sneakers. Their packaging is amazing. Great fried chicken hands down and I thought I'd never say this but their fries are actually worth it! Freshly made!</Review>< Date>

A must-try for chicken in Ktown! A great alternative to Dave’s. Definitely try The special sauce they have, it’s game changing 🔥</Review>

Currently, you order via touchscreen and wait until your food is ready. Get the sandwich combo with steak fries and treat yourself to a mostly sugar peach tea. You will not regret it. They also make great hot chicken tacos because why wouldn't they?

With current events, it's also nice that they have a small patio in the back and a little seating in the front. If you get there and it's quiet, up to three small parties can enjoy an outdoor meal. And bring your hand sanitizer just in case their dispenser's out of order.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<pics>None< /pics><Rate>3< /Rate><Text>This is my 4th time here. First two times were excellent, burgers and portion of fries were huge, totally worth the price. The first time My son and I got the original burgers (which is not spicy), and my husband and daughter got the hot ones. The second time, me and my son got chicken tenders and husband and daughter the burgers. That time when we got the tenders, they came with a side of pickled radish for the same price of the tenders. The third time, they didn't have chicken tenders but instead they had tacos. Well, that third time wax ver disappointed for my husband and I because the portions were way smaller than previous visits. Before, the burger and fries would barely fit in the cute box they had. That time, nope. We agreed not to come again. But today we were in the area and the kids were hungry and all they wanted was Michindak. Well, here we are. My daughter and I got chicken tenders, they don't give you the pickled radish with the tenders but they sell it separately for $2 extra. My son ordered the burger and it still comes with fries but the burger is tiny (like a McDonald's jr burger) and the portion of fries is like 1/4 of what it used to be. My husband ordered the whole fried chicken, which looks very differently from the picture, but well, nothing impressive for a  $15.99 plus taxes fried chicken. I'm sorry, I loved this place but  every visit is getting worse than the last. Today we told the kids that most likely were never coming back. Worth mentioning that customer service is good, staff is very helpful and nice, that's always gonna be a 5 star but the food is inconsistent in size every time.<//Text>< resp>

<text>Not original Korean fried chicken, too sad to say. Stopped by and waited 45 mins for  whole fried chicken;original style but outside breading was too thick and too greasy. Korean style fried chicken is known for non greasy yet crispy and light. Usually there is no breading...  Von's fried chicken was better. So so so disappointed< /text>< GmapID>

Came all the way from Compton to try it and even made a 20 min wait time line just to order but I gotta say it was worth it. The size is moderate when you see the menu 1 slider 1 tender dont let that fool you ! You might not even finish it ! I didn't ! Defiantly will come back< /Review>

Chicken is pretty damn good. It was crunchy and had a good kick. I also think the portions are quite large for the price. I would pass on the fries & calamari.</Review>

I used to think that the best chicken sandwich you can get fast was chic fil a, but this is an entirely different league. Not once have they messed up an order or overcooked and I eat here as much as possible (which is a lot considering it's 3 blocks away). If you like spicy get the sauce on the side because even the medium has a kick.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<date>1563572448239<//date><rate>5</rate><Review>A friend of mine lives nearby here, and recommended this place while I was visiting. We ordered a couple of chicken burgers, some chicken strips, fries, and a whole pickle.

I forget what exact flavor the chicken strips were, it was the one with the sweet orange sauce. These were excellent. Chicken is cooked wonderfully, juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside.

As for the chicken burgers, we ordered two regular and one hot. For those of you debating what level of spice to get, allow me to provide a warning. Here I was thinking oh, they have 4 or 5 levels of spice, I'm pretty good with spice and don't mind melting my face a little, let's go for level 2 (hot - level 1 is original). I was a fool. Young, naive. So full of hope. First, let me say that this chicken sandwich was amazing. The sliced pickles, the bun, the chicken itself, everything was phenomenal. But oh boy was this sandwich hot. Like, really hot. I couldn't finish it. I almost did, and oh my god I wanted to finish this sandwich, it tasted so good. But I couldn't. I'm definitely coming back for this sandwich, but next time hopefully I'm prepared (someone else said they had theirs with milk, great idea). If that was their hot, I'm sure their next levels of spice beyond that are insane. There's something about this sandwich though, I will definitely willfully subject myself to that torture again for that.

I came back again and got the original chicken burger and fries, and was again amazing (and hey I could easily finish it this time!).

I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Knock off Howlin' Rays in the best way. Korean slaw with really spicy chicken, yummy sauce on a perfect bun. $13 for sando and fries, and (what felt like) double the chicken compared to a Popeyes chicken sandwich. If you're craving fried chicken, you'll wish you had ordered two :)< /Review>

A friend of mine lives nearby here, and recommended this place while I was visiting. We ordered a couple of chicken burgers, some chicken strips, fries, and a whole pickle.

I forget what exact flavor the chicken strips were, it was the one with the sweet orange sauce. These were excellent. Chicken is cooked wonderfully, juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside.

As for the chicken burgers, we ordered two regular and one hot. For those of you debating what level of spice to get, allow me to provide a warning. Here I was thinking oh, they have 4 or 5 levels of spice, I'm pretty good with spice and don't mind melting my face a little, let's go for level 2 (hot - level 1 is original). I was a fool. Young, naive. So full of hope. First, let me say that this chicken sandwich was amazing. The sliced pickles, the bun, the chicken itself, everything was phenomenal. But oh boy was this sandwich hot. Like, really hot. I couldn't finish it. I almost did, and oh my god I wanted to finish this sandwich, it tasted so good. But I couldn't. I'm definitely coming back for this sandwich, but next time hopefully I'm prepared (someone else said they had theirs with milk, great idea). If that was their hot, I'm sure their next levels of spice beyond that are insane. There's something about this sandwich though, I will definitely willfully subject myself to that torture again for that.

I came back again and got the original chicken burger and fries, and was again amazing (and hey I could easily finish it this time!).

I highly recommend this place and will definitely be coming back.<//text>

<review>This place has decent food. Their spicy and soy garlic fried chicken was great and the japchae was amazing. If ur going to eat on a budget this might a little pricey. It's clean and a great place for friends to hang. It's not too hard to find parking there and the place is family friendly.</review></record></dataset><record>

Portion size was great however I was expecting a little more flavor from the chicken. I had the original and it wasn't hot at all so I want to try the spicy next time.< /text>

Fried chicken? Love. Heat in my mouth? Double love. A crunchy sandwich? Triple love. All put in the name of Michin Dak? So-so.

I really wanted to fall in love with Michin Dak, but it fell short of love and landed somewhat of mediocre. It isn't that their spicy fried chicken is bad, but... When I took my first bite, the bun was mushy. The flavor was spicy and on the spot, but the fries were unforgivably horrible. I took a bite and the rest went into a trash can.

I also had their macaroni salad and it was... naw at best. Given that the flavor of the sandwich was on the spot, I may give it another try. Until then, this barely three-star review remains.

This is the definition of spicy chicken holy 10/10 :)

From the bread to the chicken to the pickles wonderful bold kick in flavor that wants you to take a next bite after

Side of fries help soothe the spiciness 😂</review>

The Place: This took over the old dumpling place. You're going to a hut and eating outside. I actually would like to see more of these types of places given the mild weather LA has.

The Food: The chicken was amazing. Some of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have had. Their medium spicy is more on the hot side compared to what other places consider medium (which makes sense, they are specializing in spicy chicken). For me the medium was that perfect balance of heat but still could taste the other flavors. The Cole Slaw on the sandwich was nice and cooling. However, my complaint is that their fries are just "meh." Also when we got to the bottom of the popcorn chicken the sauce got too concentrated and was way too sweet for us. It was still good but just be mindful that the bottom may bring disappointment.

Pricing: Pricing is on par for the neighborhood. It may be more pricey than fast food, but unlike fast food you won't have regrets (unless you're sensitive to spicy food) an hour later. I will say their iced peach tea was overpriced. I would stick with the soda or bottled water if you're eating there. The iced tea was good, but was not worth the price. If it was a $1 or $1.50, it would be worth it.

What I Would Like Changed: They should get rid of the steak fries and offer tater tots or shoe-string fries. Honestly their fries were disappointing, not as disappointing as In-N-Out fries but almost as bad. Also as stated in pricing, they should lower the price of the iced tea. I get they have a nice mark-up and can make a good profit on it, but it left us feeling a little ripped off given the $3 price tag.<//text>

< Review>
I wasn't too sure which flavor to go with so I just chose the Michin Dak spicy level since I thought it was the popular choice and I like/can handle very spicy food.  I regretted it the first bite I took.  Literally the spiciest thing I have eaten my whole life.  The spicy type is the painful type. It was soooo painful and inedible. I couldn't eat anymore and felt bad as I just wasted my money. I'm not sure how people can eat this.  If you can, major respect to you.   I look on the side of the box and it gives a warning about no refunds.  Next time I will just get the regular HOT. Even if you can handle spicy food, I do not think the Michin Dak is edible and recommend to get plain HOT.< /Review>

< review>
I love spicy food. So I ordered the spicy Michin chicken wings with a side of fries to go.... Luckily I took these home to eat. The onset of fire upon taking my first bite was immediate and quite violent. The spice rocked my palette with such fervor that it threw me from my seat unto the bathroom floor, where I remained as I finished my meal. Each wing was like eating the fire emoji and surprisingly delicious. I’ve finished a gallon of water now and still feel the heat as I write this review! 5 stars. This is the 2nd spiciest chicken in K-Town. The 1st, is a story for another time<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Korean Mom's Touch
The hamburger patties are too thick with chicken breasts.
The sauce is Korean-style sauce. Expensive for taste.
Be sure to drink a drink because your throat is so choked while eating.

Very good park for children, nice playground recently installed sail shades. One half of park ok for dogs off leash Mon, Wed, Fri and Sun 6-9 a & 3-8 p. Well maintained. I prefer to avoid when adjacent middle school let's out in the p.m.< /Text>

Large open dog park with friendly locals. It's not fenced in and there are limited unleashed hours on M, W, F, Su. Kids have a great play structure, sand pit and swings in the adjacent field/play area to the NW, over the bridge. Only curbside street parking.</Text>

Worst service ever! Waited for our food in the drive thru which was not a problem until they did not give is half of our food and drinks we ordered. My husband went inside to go get the rest of it or get our money back and they gave him the food and it was all wrong again. Will never come back to this place. It's awful and run down to.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Don’t eat here! Went here and immediately got an attitude from the lady taking my order because I accidentally ordered the wrong burrito. I asked why she charged me $32 for only 2 burritos and a drink...she showed me that I ordered 3 different burritos. I told her I was sorry for the mistake, but I only needed 2 burritos. She got upset and said she couldn’t give me my money back. Whaaaaat?!? I started laughing because I thought she was joking. SHE WAS SERIOUS! My husband tried talking to her about the issue and she finally gave him $6.70 back. I didn’t want to eat anymore, so I waited in the car. My husband came out and said that he left the food there and ran out when they saw a roach on the table!!!! Disgusting!!!< /review>< pics>

The veggie burrito was delicious! The rice and beans were seasoned exactly right, the salsas had just the right amount of kick and the tortilla was soft and chewy like it should be. I'm glad we waited to find someplace like Alberto's!</review>

I had metal in my food and they didn't seem to care all they said is we don't give refunds. Fix your problem! This place is horrible. There's a better one down the street (Escondido).</Text>

Horrible service! Sat in the drive through for 10 mins waiting for someone to take our order after being ignored twice from the person in the window. We will NEVER go here again. I would advise everyone to do the same.</review>

I used to come here a lot and it was aways good. So it's been a long time, a year or so. Anyway I decide I feel like taquitos.  Friday special. 5 taquitos with quac, rice, beans and a drink. 6.99. I order . My order is ready so I go pick it up. I have never seen smaller taquitos. Literally like a few shreds of meat. One of them just looked like a rolled tortilla deep fried. They were fried so crispy I might as well been eating chips. Maybe this place has changed owners because it is not the same. I will not be returning.  Try it if you want I don't recommend the taquitos though. Sad.</Review>

<review>1st time and will be the last time I order from here Raul was close so I thought to try this place never again.I order a few Cali fries and there were looking good so my kids ate it and had some left overs for the next morning.Why we wake up in the morning and open our plates and  seen black stuff all over  on our fries and meat was darker and stink and of course I took a picture as well.Never again will I go there crazy.Just glad my kids didn't get sick at all.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Got 3 rolled tacos. They served me microwaved tacos, I can tell. I could of just bought frozen tacos myself. The guacamole was like water.   Pathetic, horrible,

Everyone was really great at helping through the process of getting my car repaired. Danielle was especially very informative. My car looks like new again and I will definitely come back in the future.< /Text>

<text>I didn't actually use their services..a family member did.  However,  I  went to pick up the vehicle. Customer service was outstanding. They detailed the car after repairs. Came outside to explain and show what they did. Also returned the rental.</text>< Pictures>

Lisa was awesome through our repair, letting us know exactly whats going on each step done. I really like that, while at work you knew, finished on time, looks really good, very happy customer.  Megan and Connie very professional and friendly to work with. Were coming back, very soon. The shop very clean and nice.<//Text>

Well to start off with I got rear-ended at a red light. Took it to this place for an estimate. Carrie with a C took pictures of the damages. She assures me that this is the place I want to be. We will see. Stay tuned for more information.<//review>

<Review>I had a tricky little dent and some scratches all over my car, I had been searching around to find the right shop to take my car and when I spoke with Alexis here at this shop, I knew I had to come here! So knowledgeable and friendly! The turn around time was so quick. Lisa made sure to update me throughout the process which was amazing, and Carrie confirmed I was happy in the very end.
Thank you to this amazing repair shop!!< /Review>< pics>

I used Caliber Collision because my car was in a accident. I did my research on all the other places and Caliber Collision came with great reviews from others. Lisa was great in keeping me informed about what was going on with my car. It was nearing the end of it being ready, and that's when the fires happened and alot of the areas in Fairfield lost power. They were very quick to let me know what was going on, and they would let me know when the power came back on to give me another estimated time it would be done. It took a couple days for them to have power again, but that same day I got a call from them. Within 3 days, I had my car back. They did a amazing job on it. Can't even tell it was in a accident. I appreciate everyone that works in that building.< /Text>

My daughter needed work on her car. She had been calling around to different shops, wasn’t Satisfied with any of the bids or customer service. She had me help find the perfect shop to take care of her new vehicle. My daughter is a health care provider and this location went above and Beyond to take care of her!!! My daughter worked with Carrie, Lisa and Alexis to get the repairs done on her vehicle. We will not go anywhere else!!!

<Text>We used caliber collision to repair damage to our front end of our Escalade (sports package). The grill was supposed to be replaced and the paint was supposed to be repaired on the front fog lights (these are blacked out). When we picked up our vehicle, they had run our vehicle through their car wash which ended up damaging the black vinyl on our window trim, the front grill was not replaced and only the driver side paint was fixed.
They said they were waiting for the parts, and would have them in a few day; but it’s been weeks now and no response.
But they sure got full payment from our insurance and our deductible.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1602708230008, 'text': 'Hi Tawanna, thank you for your feedback on your experience at our location.

The people are so nice here!! I went in to get a front license plate put on, so I didn’t have to pay a hefty amount at a dealership. They took a look at it, drove it around to the shop, created the mount for it to go on, and placed it in securely, all completely free of charge!!! Seriously made my day! I left with such a big smile on my face! They’re great people! :)</Text>

The team was very accommodating and went above and beyond to make sure my truck and I were taken care of. Dustin really sealed the deal by going the extra mile to rent me a car at their expense  so my wife and baby would not be without a car. Michelle in the office has customer service down to a science. She knows how to make you feel good when you walk in, comfortable, and confident in her communications through continual updates or changes. Overall, this team is exceptional and although I hope to not deal with damage anytime soon, I would only work with them!</text>< pics>

I went to Caliber Collision on Auto Mall Pkwy, to have my bumper checked on because my bumper was hanging from one side. The people there were great! They make you feel at home,  and they went above to take care of my problem. They guy saw my issue but also checked it out even further and noticed some deeper issues that I certainly didn’t know about. But he didn’t just tell me he, SHOWED it to me. I was so happy to know what my real issue was. I would highly recommend them to anyone. They will take care of you!< /Text>

<Text>Phenomenal work and great customer service. After I scraped up the side of my F-150 they restored it to perfect condition. Tony helped ensure they finished well ahead of schedule since I was paying out of pocket for a rental car. Dustin, the manager, polished out a few unrelated scratches for me when I picked it up. Absolutely perfect service.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Very safe park considering the size....Great for walks, picnics, hiking, jogging, yoga, nice playground for children, and at night a kool place to hang out & party if your an adult, although there are many homeless I can say that should not scare you from visiting this park.......all of these things & more including North Americas largest zoo and many very nice museums make Balboa Park what it is........a safe common ground for all people to share, hang out, maybe even chat with a stranger.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
The park play area over on sixth is dirty, cracked, and a homeless man was sleeping in the play area. It was 10AM. The toddler swings look like they have mold. The whole park feels like it needs to be cleaned with some bleach. It was very disappointing.</Review>

Many more kids rides and features than other parks.  Come swirl around with the joy of centrifugal forces as you spin faster and faster.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>(Translated by Google) One of the most practical and fun places to take children to play, there is a garden around it and they can run freely, plus parking is allowed for free on both sides of the park (only Wednesdays from 7 to 10 no, on the side of the avenue)

Uno de los lugares más prácticos y divertidos para llevar a los niños a jugar, hay jardín alrededor y pueden correr libremente, además se permite estacionarse sin costo en ambos lados del parque (solo miércoles de 7 a 10 no, del lado de la avenida)< /Review>< Pictures>

The guy was rude, there was no line and we had what we wanted, the clerk felt he needed to help everyone in thebstore before us, he went out of the way to ignore helping us. He needs to be fired...then to patronize us as we left. This was 4.3.21, around 3.< /text>

Went in on a weekday and the dude working was great. I was buying a first time board for my partner and he insisted I just get the deck and to come back so my partner could stand on the board and they could figure out together what would be the best fit. Came back a few days later on a weekend and a dif guy working said none of that is needed for a beginner and that whatever he grabbed was fine. I was bummed about the second experience but the first was dope.</Review>

Thanks for being so cool to my 9 year old. He came in with his dad and his  Walmart board. Mega frustrated that he couldn't turn, trucks were tight, he was just so aggravated!

<text>Remember, every place, shop experience- will always be fun, as long as you treat people with respect and aren't a know it all.  Bought a Primitive from them. fair price, knowledgeable staff and great location.  I like this place, because rather then try to sell you a bunch of unnecessary things, they actually help you.  I've been boarding (Skate, Long, Surf and Snow) about 30 years. Go here, first!!!!</text></record></dataset><record>

The skate deck selection is decent, but nothing special.  Most shops have more.  The truck and wheel selection is poor.  Very little to choose from.  They barely have any clothes.  It's just a couple dozen t-shirt styles and some hats.  If you like Nike and Adidas, you'll probably like this shop because that's about all they have for shoes.  I'm pretty sure its a skateboarder owned shop, so its surprising they don't support skateboarder owned shoe companies instead of sticking to the sporting goods brands.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>My experience from start to finish has been great. Got an excellent price for an entire new furnace/heating system install and the techs were amazing. Matt and Miguel showed up On Time ( ha ha ) and were super friendly and courteous and funny.  I got the feeling they really enjoyed doing their job. They did a beautiful job on the installation and cleaned everything up beautifully. I would definitely have them back again in the future!  I don't leave  reviews all that often, but their service was over and above.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOaLROxGTKyZd7x4XJxC5pg-3GECHI9MHYaKj6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf6fg0Ek0PHdndr-4Oka0HziQ2B_YtFLA7GFVm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDRqYRp98xMcAxhyVfypEklSdaX111OE_R8Vga=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOq7RavYdu9QQhfpsGDMoJOE-bbeSXOGg0HiCjq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwVoT6EwSiDc7Y7xZQtJAKPg8vGRo0DjC6ifJv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWMvk3Y6KPHT0_xK0HCxwYXTVchLERLDUglT_Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGz00urzYQjfs2KCFvRv4QNLbhtStHR5pT2euV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>We had issues with our air conditioner not blowing cold air, we called on time home services and they took care of the issue and installed a new thermostat reader. Within an hour we had a cold air again, and we couldn’t be more grateful in this heat. Alex was professional and extremely helpful. He walked us through the issues we had with our heating and cooling and gave us tips on how to maintain or system going forward. He even took time to teach us how to use the thermostat which we really appreciate. Thanks Ontime and thanks Alex.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>Great job by folks at On Time. Courteous, responsive and reliable. Had to get some emergency work done recently. In an industry (and time of year) where homeowners can't help feeling taken advantage of, these guys were superstars. Mike, Gus and the team were awesome: transparent and efficient. Highly recommended and would use again if needed.</text><Rating>5</Rating><response>None</response>< Pics>

Needed to replace my 25 year old HVAC system. Spent several months having various companies give quotes. Decided on using OnTime for the work. Gus was so knowledgable and beat all the other quotes I was was given. Great financing options, came out to tweak a few things and have been very satisfied with all the services they have provided since installation. Happy I took the time to check out various companies before system broke. OnTime  was by far the best of all I considered. Shout out to Alex who came to troubleshoot for me after installation. Very satisfied with my decision in choosing OnTime for my HVAC installation. Honest, forthright and efficient. They are excellent with customer service as well as giving the most competitive pricing out there.</Text>

<Review>I called them at 9:00 AM and by 11:00 AM Ricky was in our home taking care of our AC that had stopped working. Ricky was a complete pro, he let us know what he was doing as he was doing it. Not only did he fix the problem but he checked all the filters, cleaned everything up and then offered options on what we can do to fix it. I would recommend them and Ricky to anyone.

Caution to consumers. While covertly trying to price out a new AC unit for a working model, I was told I'm not a "decision maker" and instead quoted $460 to repair a compressor that coincidentally went out as the technician was assessing. Called JB3 Heating & AC who simply reconnected compressor.</text>

I was so pleased they were able to come the day I called as my home warranty people had me on a six day wait with 101° heat and I was not able to use the air conditioner as my roof would’ve fell in due to secondary damage  from the leakage.
I  told my home warranty people they should put On Time on their list of providers to use as they are apparently better than the ones they have.  They are definitely the ones I will call for all of my air-conditioning needs.< /Text>< pics>

The Owner, Mike is a very friendly, professional and knowledgeable owner who stands behind his work as well as employees making a wonderful working experience for us as customers. I have had the pleasure of utilizing their services on my old HVAC/Heating equipment and then made the very wise decision to purchase a new HVAC/Heating system from Mike in 2016. Alex Wood is a fabulous technical rep who knows maintenance of systems and communicates thoroughly when on an appointment and will go the extra mile to make the experience genuine and very efficient. Ann, Gus, JT, John and Cindy are people in this company that I have had the pleasure to work with on an ongoing basis and their knowledge and customer service set the standards that all companies unfortunately fail to reach. So if you are looking for a quality company that is efficient and has excellent customer service oriented folks, give "On Time Home Services" a try as you will be very glad you did. Thank you to all for your excellence and your friendly amazing efficient business experiences.

< review>
Ty was the absolute best technician I've had the pleasure of working with in many years. With managing and owning multiple properties I've dealt with a lot of technicians and Ty ensured everything was finished in a timely, friendly and cost effective manner. This is now my go to company for anything AC related in Temecula and surrounding areas.</review>

Gus Robles and his team was a pleasure to work with. I have never seen service technicians diagram and photograph everything they did like Gus. This made me very confident in the work they were doing and relieved to know that my business's air conditioning units were working great again. I highly recommend On Time Home Services if you are looking for passionate and committed technicians who will take great care of you. Great work!</review>

Gus has taken care of us for a couple years and has always done a great job.  I particularly appreciate how well he explains what he's doing and I trust the advice he provides regarding additional maintenance or repair.<//Review>

Did great work on my fathers house. They were very polite and knew exactly what they were doing.
I will always recommend this company to friends and family for any service related to their homes.

It’s great to know when I get back on my feet and I get a place of my own. I know for a fact that they will be there to help with any problems.
Again my father and I thank you guys so much for all the hardwork.< /Text>

I have dealt with On Time Home Services several times over the last few years and I can only say that they are the most honest and professional HVAC company that I have found in my local area. They have worked with me on my equipment (trying to save the old system) and been honest about my need to replace. After all of that, I still shopped the price and found them to be lower. I have recommended them to my friends and family.< /text>

<Review>Horrible no ethics! All they did was short out my heating system to try to sell me a $3,000 + system. They were quick to send out a sales representative next day but they never fixed it.

As everyone here in SoCal knows we have pretty much perfect weather until we don't and then your AC doesn't work

I called other HVAC guys in the area and they were all booked up I was able to get one guy out and it didn't really seem like he wanted to be working and then on top of that his equipment was not working so he did a very lousy diagnostic test on my AC system and gave me some ridiculous pricing info charge me for the lousy diagnostic test and was on his way

So I decided that I would give On Time Home Services a call they set up an appointment for the next day

First thing in the morning Gus was there and did a full diagnostic test and informed me that it might be time for a new system he went over the different options and was very knowledgeable in HVAC and in the whole installation process I was very pleased with Gus and his presentation So I decided to signed up with him to have a new system installed

He got in touch with his office and scheduled an installation appointment for two days later

Two days later first thing in the morning Bob and the crew were here with everything they needed to get the job done and they did an amazing job installing the new system

The new system works amazing

Thanks to Gus, Bob, Preston, Peggy and the whole team at On Time Home Services

Highly recommend</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>They called this morning offering an inspection. No caller ID and phone number zeroed out. When asked how they got my number proceeded to tell me that it popped up on their computer. They called me by my wife's name. I hate these unsolicited calls and would never use this company.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

He turned off my gas for the Heater/furnace and told me that the gas was leaking, and tried to put fear on me by saying that the gas was going to go in my lungs and I could die, so that I buy the new system from them.

I did not trust this man, from the moment he walked into my house.
I paid him for nothing, he left a mess up in the adic.

I called a different company, they fixed what he messed up, and told me that there was no reason for him to turned off the gas for the furnace, they checked everything and no leaking of gas at all.

Don't trust this company, I paid them to come to sell me a new system and not even fix the problem.

I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS ONTIME COMPANY<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I have always enjoyed the simplicity of their menu and the consistency at every location but this last time that we were there was a total disappointment. I specifically asked for a protein-style cheeseburger WITHOUT tomato. Not only did they add tomato but as I was removing it I noticed a nasty hair!!! Total appetite killer 🤢<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjoV24g9Jnr4aF-PyR_kExClT-Y5sHF4Te3WJ3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><name>Leidi Escobar<//name>< Time>

<review>I love it here. Simple menu but very effective. From the burgers to the animal style fries your taste buds will thank you. I love onions and nothing makes me happier then to see their not afraid to generously add them in.

As a child this spot was my favorite spot to eat, their food was always the best. It has been yrs. since i ate here. Today i went, my burger was definetly the way i remember it but my fries were stone cold they tasted as if they were still frozen. When i got home i had to recook them for me and my family to enjoy them. This is not the way they use to do their food.< /Text>

Great restaurant, food is quick and great. The only downside is the same downside for all In-N-Out locations...parking. Parking is very limited.</text>

This restaurant was good on customer service, our cashier was on her first day and did a great job with a $60 dollar order. Honestly though, I've never been a fan of in n out but I appreciate the hard work all the front line workers have committed themselves toward.

Of course, in and out is the best burger joint with 3 combos and a hidden secret knock menu. This restaurant was good on customer service, our cashier was on her first day and did a great job with a $60 dollar order. Honestly though, I've never been a fan of in n out but I appreciate the hard work all the front line workers have committed themselves toward. Also, whataburger is still the better burgers.< /Review>

In-N-Out Visalia: Same great burgers and shakes that can be found at any other In-N-Out franchise. Fries didn't taste as good though. Wait time was crazy: 20ish+ cars in the drive thru and 10+ people in line inside.<//Review>

Animal Style!
The drive through line is long to point of disbelief, and the reason is because the food is great.  Skip the long drive-through line, walk inside and get nearly immediate service. The inside is open and very rarely has a line now days.  The staff is always happy and always friendly.  In-N-Out kills it.  I've never had a bad experience in nearly 30 years of enjoying their fresh burgers and fries.  The only draw back is they have very few locations.<//Review>

<review>In-N-Out Burger has never and will never be a disappointment in my opinion. Wait times can get a bit high at this location. However, the excellent customer service, cleanliness, and freshness of it's ingredients is a few reasons my family and I choose to give business to In-N-Out Burger in Visalia,CA.

Through this pandemic, I've noticed the drive through lines getting longer and longer. IN-N-OUT has figured out a way to keep everyone fed, and in decent time too. You can go inside and order for takeout, or they have their patio open for sit down dining. For the drive through, there's an employee outside taking orders, so the wait time is cut in half! I was in line for no longer than 15 minutes! Thanks IN-N-OUT for being delicious and efficient!!</text>

For the drive through, there's an employee outside taking orders, so the wait time is cut in half! I was in line for no longer than 15 minutes! Thanks IN-N-OUT for being delicious and efficient!!</text><Rate>5< /Rate>< pics>

<Review>They have never gotten my order wrong. Burgers and fries are always fresh. The burger buns taste so good. The spread they put in the burgers is delicious. Best CA!<//Review>< user_id>

<text>Do not go to this In n Out unless you want to wait in a line that has around twenty plus cars. Their line went way past their building and was behind some businesses. Lady at Jack in the Box said it’s always like that. 😳😆😖🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️< /text>< Pictures>

The Chick-Fil-A of the west but much, much better.  Expect similar lines -- that is to say, there's always a convoy at the drive-through.  If you can go when the lines are short it's a great experience.  I think they're some of the best 'fast food' type burgers around.</text>

<review>In and Out takes fast food to a new level. Their burgers are hot, ingredients fresh, lettuce, tomatoes and onion tasty too. You can get a protein burger wrapped in lettuce or figure out the secret menu and you can have a fun variety too. I forgot to say that it's really affordable too.

Super crowded, not sure if there's ever a good time to go (not from cali) but despite the crowd they have a great system to make sure they're fast and take care of everyone. We didn't wait too long for our food. They were polite and friendly, great customer service. Fairly clean and Food was delicious, which is why it's always packed.<//Review>

<Text>In-N-Out Burger is awesome for a fast food restaurant. I trust the ingredients that they use and the methods they use to cook. Always decently priced. Also, the ice cream is a must.

Was a bittersweet CA visit this go around but made the most of a bad situation starting with some needed In-N-Out right off the get-go. Service was friendly and quality was on par (animal fries!) however they could use a bit of process improvement to streamline the drive-thru as the wait was a bit painful.</review>

Trying to pull in to any other business in this shopping center is made more difficult due to the blockage of the parking lot caused by the drivers in the drive through. The entrance from Walnut is blocked by customers of this restaurant for any other business in the shopping center from this entrance.< /review>

<text>The best place to get hamburger in Visalia is In & Out. Yes, there is always a big line but it's worth it. The smell and the taste are so good. I love them you have to try them. They have some tables that you can sit and enjoy the beautiful day!< /text><rating>5< /rating></record>

< review>
What can I say? In-N-Out Burger is the best in the business! They know what they're doing! Food is always top quality and fresh! Service is always superb! Prices are always great! I have only one BIG complaint though! With them being so fantastic brings a lot of business. The problem is it's always a full house and we have to wait for someone to get up to be able to set down and people are always fighting for a table! The restaurant's need to be twice the size to handle the congestion! The one thing you can count on is that you can visit any In-N-Out Burger and expect the absolute best food and service which makes them #1 in my book!</review>

<Review>We love going to In-N-Out Burger because their fries are gluten free since nothing else is cooked in the oil. Many places claim their product is gluten free but it isn't. The product might be flueten free but not the oil since they cook other products with gluten. How do I know, because I ask if only fries are cooked in their oil. By cooking it in a contaminated oil, the fries are not gluten free any more. To make the burger gluten free, I just order it protein style.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYlPsW_MVxhJFLZAPHvkK_GF-1NjydCjDX3vV9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Date>1606683546753< /Date><GmapID>0x80952f486d09a2cd:0xe98613b3067f324b<//GmapID><Response>None<//Response>< rating>

This place is always packed. But despite that, I'm always given exceptions service and my order has (thus far) been accurate every single visit. I got here fairly often and even though there's a long line, the wait time is fast given how many people they help. Amazing food, kind speedy service, and accurate order. What more could you want?! 👍</Review>

<Review>Every time we come to in and out Burger we always get our order correct never have any problems 😊 staff is always extremely friendly and the store is always extremely clean as well. They work fast and very hard and they do an amazing job at what they. I admire every one of them for their hard work. If I could work there I would in a heartbeat!!!🙃</Review>< pictures>

This place is always packed. But despite that, I'm always given exceptions service and my order has (thus far) been accurate every single visit. I got here fairly often and even though there's a long line, the wait time is fast given how many people they help. Amazing food, kind speedy service, and accurate order. What more could you want?! 👍</Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>Immaculate restaurant. Friendly employees and excellent customer service; always a smile here. Always! The hamburger is delicious. It's so huge it's almost impossible to get your mouth opened wide enough to take a bite. The crowd is a diverse crowd., always friendly and courteous. The prices are under $10 which includes hamburger, fries and a drink.<//Text>< Rate>

I don't recommend using the drive thru if your in a hurry drive thru line always blocks a lane of traffic an accident waiting to happen but other than that it's great.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

You can't go wrong with a double double! The wait is long of you decide to use the drive-thru. When ordering inside they are quick. Love the food and the great atmosphere by the staff friendly and ready to serve!</text>

Disappointed. Walked in floors were sticky and black across the entire restaurant. Tables clearly had not been cleaned off. Received our meal and the grilled cheese (a cheeseburger minus the meat packed lettuce). When shown to a worker, she said it was in there. At this point, we were frustrated with the lack of cleanliness and In-n-Out is known for super clean and friendly restaurants, that it wasn't worth the energy...then she came over with a wrapper of lettuce correcting the error. We will try it again, but please clean the restaurant.<//text>

<Review>The amount of customers through the place makes me wonder. Do that many people really think the food is That good? Or is it because it's a $1.50 cheaper than most other fast food. I give 3 stars for awe inspired wonder!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80952f486d09a2cd:0xe98613b3067f324b<//Gmap_id>< response>

<text>Everyone loves this place that's why there's always a long line. But the line goes so fast. My grandson works there and he loves it. He's been there for a couple years and he's trying to move up into a management position. I am so proud of him. I had a hamburger and fries and it only came to $4 and some change. Now that's reasonable. And you know how good the food is.</text>< user_id>

<Review>What can I say? I work down the street and sometimes grab lunch here. I'm from Cali, but this is NOT the end all be all burger joint here. It is what it's supposed to be. Pretty good burger, fast service, and that's it. If this is your favorite place then good for you. But I have had, and will continue to have, better burgers. Again, I do like in n out, but it's not my all time favorite. I miss Fatburger.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< gmap_id>

What can I say crowded as ever that must mean it's got good food.   I will vouch for that damn good juicy burgers.  French fries are good. Iced tea is pretty good but the damn ice melts too fast<//text>

Worst In N Out I’ve ever been to. They’ve consistently got my order wrong for the past six months. My wife and I even emphasize how we want our burgers and all we get is attitude from the girls that work there. The only reason this In N Out is in business is because it has no competition. This In N Out would not have five stars if it were in Los Angeles. I’ve been eating at In N Out for over twenty-five years! I’ve  eaten at almost every In N Out from here to Texas and this one is definitely the worst one. I recommend paying the extra five dollars and going to the Habit Burger up the street.< /review>

I'm a truck driver, and many restaurants have refused me walk up service during Covid 19. In n Out was gracious enough to allow me to order, and bring it out to me. Excellent food, and MAJIR PROPS to the crew in Visalia. You have ensured that I will return. Thank you much from a South Carolina trucker</Text>

Always fast and efficient. Food is usually accurate and we don't have issues getting our order wrong. The lines are always long because everyone knows where the good burgers are. Every employee here should be proud to work at the most popular joint in town. Can't get enough of their grilled onions, sweet and carmelized. Writing this is making me hungry, off to grab me burgers and fries!<//text>

The food was pretty good, I enjoyed it. The line for the drive-thru is crazy long sometimes, I suggest that you go through the inside for quicker service. The place is pretty clean and they clean the tables constantly which is nice. Overall it's a good place to grab a bite.<//Review>

The staff is always spot on. The burgers are consistent. But I have more fun at the DMV than standing around, waiting for food or getting tackled by tourist and crazed locals. I just wanna eat, man. This place needs a bigger building. Or close the lobby and force us to just eat in the parking lot.</text>

I love in-n-out burger. I have a very sensitive digestive system, so fast food always makes me sick. Since in-n-out burger is all fresh ingredients, I can actually eat here without getting sick. Even though the menu options are small, there are a lot of options on the hidden menu. Just look it up online. Even though they are always really crowded, they work fast and wait is not too bad.< /review>

Most days they are absolutely great always have a long line but they improved on it by moving the line out of the way of traffic. They are always super fast for the length of line in the drive thru. Inside can be a pain as you have to wait to find a table or share with strangers but it's fine if you take it to go. The fries are always cut fresh in store and taste amazing.< /text>

I am addicted to this place. It smells wonderful on the outside and it tastes even better. Food is always fresh and the staff is always chatty and happy. Great place.
Only down side is how busy it is and the huge line of cars in the drive thru. This has become a bit dangerous to navigate. Please open a second location!</Review>

Food is good, the burgers especially. Price also very cheap. The lines are always very long, interior is a bit bland but i guess it is in style. The fries were not crispy. Their style is soggy, i didnt really like that.<//text>

The food is always fresh.  No soggy lettuce or tomatoes ever. And the employees always have a smile on their face, no matter how busy they are. And they usually are busy, which shows that quality food and employees that are treated well really pays off.</review>

<review>It doesn't matter which location you go to...the customer service is always good and the food is great! Only con is that it's so popular there that you might experience a long wait, but that is changing soon because there are talks of a second location opening soon!

<Review>It doesn't matter which location you go to...the customer service is always good and the food is great! Only con is that it's so popular there that you might experience a long wait, but that is changing soon because there are talks of a second location opening soon!

The wait was really long, as always, but we didn't mind that too much. The staff was rather friendly. My issue comes with the food. The fries were pretty good. However, our burgers were not very good at all. I don't really know what's happened over the past few years but this place seems to have gone downhill quite a bit.<//Review>

< Review>
So most of you know people literally wait forever to eat burgers here. I personally find the burger a 8/10, fries 6/10, and shakes 9/10. I don't like the how messy and dirty the place is. Everytime I go, I clean the tables myself as people don't know how to clean after themselves.  don't like how we can't find tables, and don't like the wait. I come here once in while only because of friends and family. I prefer they open a second location but I know that won't happen. if you have the time and patience go for it, but if in a hurry skip it.</Review>

We, as a family eat at In-N-Out at least twice a week after bowling nights, I started eating at In-N-Out in the 70’s when I would visit my parents in Baldwin Park. In-N-Out has never disappointed, nor have they ever gotten my order wrong. Kudos In-N-Out, to many more years....<//Review>

<Review>Awesome food and service. It was early afternoon on a weekday and the place inside and drive thru were loaded and they were still quick to get our order inside. Tables were cleaned as soon as people got up to leave and new group ready to sit down again. Awesome place< /Review>< Pics>

I love this eatery. Most times we wait in our car to order but decided instead to walk up to the counter. Our order was exactly the way we ordered. I especially wanted very little  salt on my fries and that's exactly the way I got them!< /review>

Charged me for someone else's order. Took ten minutes for two Double-Doubles, with no other cars in line. Took another five minutes to correct charges, and declined to offer anything for the inconvenience. Kinda disappointed in a quality organization.< /Text>

Awesome food and service. It was early afternoon on a weekday and the place inside and drive thru were loaded and they were still quick to get our order inside. Tables were cleaned as soon as people got up to leave and new group ready to sit down again. Awesome place</text>

This In N Out is always busy and drive thru lane is very curvy.  Be sure to account for the wait.< /text>

In-N-Out Burger is a must have if you like great burgers, it is one of the best experiences a person can make regards food for the masses. the food always tastes as expected,  you get what you want... you go to In N Out  and you enjoy the wait, because better food, takes more time...drink some soft drink, talk to someone and sure enough good food will come to you< /text>

I don't like or ever eat In-n-out burger, I get it for the family then I grab Burger King right next door. I have a relativele that sells. Meat to local burger joints in town, and with that knowledge of the places that buy the most interesting meat, I've made my choice of what burgers I'd never in my life eat again.< /Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>Is it my imagination or are the burger patties smaller than no too long ago? Today's was small and dry. I thought; If I basically liked in-n-out could I just order the double to make up the difference? It is only a dollar more. Hmmmm. Let me think. Burger King. No Whatta Burger. No.Five guys. NO. From my own kitchen. Yes Same price. Huge 80/20 burger x2.<//text>< pics>

Great place... great employees.... But the line that stretches all the way out into walnut ave. Every night that creates a traffic jam is not cool... Another location is greatly needed in visalia california.... Its not the ability of the people that work there that create the quagmire.. You can only serve customers so fast... You can't make things cook faster than they actually can... Get it together in-n-out people love your burgers... For good cause.. Food is great but the amount of customers overwhelm one location</Text>

I’ve been to dozens of in and out across the state of California. In and out in Visalia was my least favorite. The staff was not nearly as friendly as everywhere else and their burgers were substandard when measuring to every other in and out.</review>

<Text>Best hamburgers in Visalia!! Cheap and very delicious!! Their animals style fries are the best. The only down fall would have to be the wait is very long drive through or dine in, you’ll have to wait a while. But it’s so worth the wait<//Text>< Pictures>

Always consistent burgers! You could eat here or in Fresno, and they are made exactly the same. Excellent food try animal style burgers or fries for a change of pace.<//text>

<Text>It's In-N-Out. This location is always busy, crowded, long lines. However the streamlined approach to making the food creates a pretty short wait time. So don't despair when you see that long long line. It's worth it.
Tasty burgers. Consistent​ly yummy food.
I'd recommend ordering the fries "well" or "extra well" done, as they regularly are quite limp and anemic.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Hard to say anything bad about this place.
the food is always good, the service is always fast and friendly.
They really need another visalia location, it gets packed before and after lunch. There are about 15 cars in line and the parking lot is cramped. That tells you how great this place really is.< /Text>

Visalia In-N-Out is always packed for a reason. The food is consitently on point and for the amount of traffic they receive they are exceptionally fast with getting orders out. The employees are friendly and good at getting orders correct everytime I've gone. I definitely hope they put one in Tulare soon.<//Review>

<Text>I wish they would fix the parking lot because it has gotten to the point that accidents are going to happen.
I would die for In N Out's food but the mess that the lines have become are making it not worth it. I've been coming to In N Out since I was a little kid and am in my 20s and this is the worst it has ever been.<//Text>< pics>

The hamburgers are ok...It's not the best hamburger 🍔 either tho...To be honest it never gets me full...I dont like it that its always hella packed...I only go tho when my brother in law wants to go when we go to Visalia...But if it were to be for me and my husband we prefer Burger King 👑 or Jack in the Box...< /Review>

Its in-n-out of course its amazing. They always are quick but they do have a long line on account of the way theyre set up on the corner so it seems like more cars than normal but its worth it. They are always fresh and tastes amazing.<//review>

Yes, I had to try the In--Out Burger restraunt place while traveling. I do not like to eat at Mc D's type plastic fast food & mystery meats drive thu's. Don't hv in my part of country. My boys wanted try, so we did bc it was late & not much open.  We all saw lines wrapped around building & wondered WHY ? So we all tried burger meals,doubles for boys loaded with toppings. Being leary I tried a single
burger& fries.
I was pleasantly surprised the burger meals were  decent & hot. Toppings made the flavor..& burger Not meat quality!!
(I raise beef cattle side hussle -know quality & grades)
Very thin meat patties. I can see why most ppl were ordering doubles. Very
REASONABLY $ for a whole meal that includes a fountain drink. $6-$7.99
GOOD for a occasional meal, but would NOT EAT on regular basis.I don't really think it's that Heathly at all. It's a CHEAP meal & a FAD.< /Text>

<text>Good burgers, good fries, and good service. Burgers never seem to be undercooked, fries are always done right, and the vegetables seem pretty fresh. The only thing that kinda sucks is the wait, but the food makes it worth it in the end.</text>< Pictures>

Parking and drive thru is insane. Burger buns are greasy got my order wrong twice the once part was that it was just one meal. They have their employees outside with no shade, no water, sweaty like crazy trying to get order through. Each time I go it's getting worse.< /text>

I am going to go ahead and give this In N Out 5 stars based on the food and the value. But I will say this... the place is always packed.... It’s impossible to find a table... If you want to sit with a group bigger than 4 - practically impossible.... The drive through is worse than the dining room... The line extends out into the main street half the time. So, there you go.<//text>

Always crowded but great place to eat. They are friendly and very accommodating in that I have a servere gluten allergy. They were all very careful in handling my food. Even busy, they are right on the ball with cleaning tables as soon as they are vacant.</Review>

If I'm rating the service, price and cleanliness...always top notch, hate the drive thru line, ridiculous that it causes them to cut off all the parking because it wraps around like a snake sometimes 30 cars deep...cant wait for the new o e coming g soon...< /Text>

Still very slow. Wait is too long!!!! They need to increase cooking capacity. They have a small flat top to cook burgers in. So they can only cook a small amount of burgers at a time vs the amount of customers coming in.<//text>

<Review>Whenever I go here, I know I'll always be eating the freshest and best tasting Fast Food burger in town. The restaurant is always kept clean and tidy. If it weren't for long wait times to receive your food, then this review would've been a 5/5.<//Review>< user_name>

<user_name>Ana Gutierrez<//user_name><Review>Plenty of food all around but sometimes it's just good to have a simple but great burger. The only thing I would change would be the fries, they're ok but just need more robust and filling, they actually get hard quick and taste more like cardboard. Other than that, great burger joint.</Review><rate>5<//rate><UserId.>108059412366331684416</UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Love this place. I will wait. Donated money to Human trafficking cause they are doing now. God Bless you for trying to stop this terrible cruelty and making it more public. We must stop human trafficking and support the victims..</review>

Peppy, friendly customer service. We have a big family and all like our burgers a little differently. It doesn’t seem to matter which In N Out we go to, they always get it right. Long drive-thru line for lunch, but they are quick and efficient as ever!<//text>

It is a very good hamburger restaurant and usually very busy. There is usually a line to order, but definitely worth the wait. Drive thru always busy as inside. Well worth the few minutes wait.< /Text>

<Review>The best In-N-Out Burger in the central valley. yes the drive-thru lines takes forever but when you have 15 cars in line and 20 people dining in, it takes a while. but when you finally get your food its tastes so fresh, Clean, and well cooked. the employees are always friendly and i can honestly say I've never had nor have i ever heard about any problems with this particular In-N-Out.</Review><pics>None</pics><username>Jerry Payne (SuperJerryPayne)< /username>< Response>

Busy.  Open late.  They've never gotten my order wrong.  Ever.  For a fast-food chain restaurant, these guys are straight-up, pro-bowl-quality employees.  Very impressive, especially for around here.  Win.<//Text>

A true staple in California! Dont forget to look up the online "secret menu" as it has fan favorites such as the "Flying dutchman" or the healthier option of "protein style". Make sure to try some of their lemonade and of course grab a few spicy chilis on the way out. They are often located near the condiments or available through the drive through upon request.< /Review>

When very busy, this particular store seems to lose quality. If the line for the drive-thru is more than 5 cars, you might want to eat elsewhere. When slow, fantastic food!</Review>

This place has delicious burgers. If you have not asked for animal style on your burger, yet, protein style for your burger (which means lettuce wrap instead of buns), or spread for your fries, then you are missing out. This is also a good place to dip their fries in their milkshake. It has a simple menu, and a secret menu online, so be sure to try some of these secret options. The lines can be long, reaching out towards the street. This means it will take 15-20 minutes to get through the line of cars before you are on your way out with your food. They are usually quite busier than any other fast food restaurnt around, but they move the line pretty fast compared to the others as well.</text>

Can't go wrong with InOut! Had never been to the Visalia location and they didn't disappoint either. Was worried when I saw the huge Drive In queue but we were served quickly inside, can't see the point of sitting endlessly in your car when you can enjoy the atmosphere inside!< /text>

<text>Food is good but takes forever to get a table. You basically have to stand next to a table that looks like they're about done but even then some rude person will just go right in front of you when you're about to sit down and sit down first which is what happened today. I prefer drive thru over having to deal,with this< /text><Rating>3<//Rating>< pictures>

<text>This a wonderful FAST-FOOD restaurant but there are always two manny people the dont salt the fries or the salt them to much the burgers are full a grease and there small so the wait is not evan worth it. I do not recommend In-N-Out if you have not gone don't go its better if you go to somewhere like McDonald's or jack in the box.< /text>< pictures>

My only complaint is that the wait times can get long and sometimes there's no place to sit and eat when you order in. Other than that the quality of the food is top notch. Same goes for customer service.<//review>

For how long the lines are this is one of the o my places I will sit and wait for however long it takes just to make my order. The foods always made to order and the milkshakes are thick and yummy. The fries are always perfect.<//review>

< Review>
As always, it’s In-N-Out! I love the food. The downside, and it is a BIG one, is the parking. It is horrible during peak times. I would highly recommend parking at Orchard and walking the short distance during and around lunch and dinner, otherwise you may struggle to get in or out. The drive thru often backs up onto Walnut so using the access at the far west end of the parking lot is always my strategy. Great food, terrible parking lot/drive-thru layout.< /Review>

Well, I USED to tell everyone how wonderful the food was... But this time, my burger tasted dry, fries tasted old...I was disappointed to say the least. Perhaps it was just this in-n-out burger, I will probably never go to that place again.. But I will cont to go to in-N-out burger at a different location!! I haven't had any other bad experiences at other locations< /review>

Fresh, NEVER frozen burgers, never frozen fries, yummy shakes and a simple menu. Drive thru is always fast and inside is always clean. Can get a little crowded at times but it's worth it. Try to find out about their secret menu!</Review>

<Review>Those lazy people complaining about the drive thru get out of your car and stop polluting. Expect the best quality correctly made every time. Best burger you can get dollar per dollar in America.if you want the best burger in the world get a triple triple protein animal style with added regular onions and a sauce on the side. It will melt in your mouth and you will be hooked like crack.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Very busy; most popular, nostalgic restaurant. Fast, friendly help, though often a line and some waiting time, but of course that is because very consistantly good food and drink; coffee is good too!< /Review>

<text>A California staple how could I not give it 5 stars. I love this place but this particular location is usually very busy and the drive thru lines circle the parking lot. Its difficult to find a place to park on a Friday or Saturday evening.  If you manage to find a parking spot close to the restaurant be careful, because you could end up blocked in my other vehicles waiting for the drive thru. I suggest parking in the adjacent parking lot Orchard or other. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope they open a second location soon!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Those lazy people complaining about the drive thru get out of your car and stop polluting. Expect the best quality correctly made every time. Best burger you can get dollar per dollar in America.if you want the best burger in the world get a triple triple protein animal style with added regular onions and a sauce on the side. It will melt in your mouth and you will be hooked like crack.<//Text>

Always packed and always gets the food out right, fast, and tasting good. 5 stars is for fast food but In-N-out sets a great standard for all to follow.< /Text>

One of the Best Burgers, Fries, drinks.
Great Shakes and Everything is made as ordered. Beautiful cordial Staff.  Delicious food, open late and the has both family dining & drive thru. Takes a moment to get thru drive thru because the food is great.
Meal is made to order and much more. Right across from The Mall, on the corner of Mooney Boulevard and Walnut Avenue going West in Visalia, California.
"FAVOR"
(Christian Based and has Favor from Father most-high in the Heaven's over this establishment! Popular to all ages & Nationalities) Wish they would build one on North East location.< /Text>

This is the In N Out that made me fall in love with these classic burgers. The service is always great and the location is prime since you can make easy lunch stops after some shopping. The lines can get very hectic both inside and through the drive through window.< /review>

<Text>Not good. Orderd  6 combos.only gave me four fries. When I went to ask for the other two they kept ignoring me. all and all after a 10 minute wait I decided I didn't need the other fries. Felt  ignored. After I threw the receipt on the counter and walked away. Then they brought me the fries. I sat there seeing them pack and give fries to every one els but me.. What ever. Never again. Plenty of other friendly hamburger places to eat.< /Text>< pictures>

In-N-Out Burger is a unique place because they are not like Mcdonald's that have evetything come in boxes then put in the frezer. "Everything" would mean stuff like fries, the buns, the meat, etc. It's extraordinary delicious and cheap😍😍😌<//text>

And tastes like artificially flavored, but really its the ridiculously long line that i really hate. They try to make it go faster but 30 Minutes in a drive thru is ridiculous, i rarely find the foor worth the wait.</Review><Time>1531691529583</Time>< Name>

Why even write a review you either like in-n-out or don't. Oh also just go inside drive through takes 45 minutes. Going inside takes 15< /Text>

<review>Messed my order up. Waited wayyyy to long for nothing. They started serving people who ordered after us and ordered more than us. And they still managed to mess up my burger. I just wanted peppers added on it, nothing fancy or hard. Waited at least 15 mins for this.<//review>< pics>

Don't understand the hype. Where's the beef? The tomato and lettuce were fresh, but there the beef was nonexistent. Fries just ok, they don't stand out. Go to Five Guys.</Text>

This In-N-Out never disappoints. I go here just about every time I'm in Visalia. I'm a big animal double-double and regular fries kind of guy. I highly recommend that combo if you haven't had In N Out before!</Review>

<review>Our experience was great.  The man next to us was number 91 when our number 98 came up he wondered where he's was.  So he went to see. Two minutes later they came with his food and a big smile and apology.  They were very to him and give him a free coupon.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>They will put a burger together to your specifications with a smile! My son gets 4 by 4's. I get cheese sandwiches. BUT the main thing I like about the food is that the FRIES are fresh cut, cooked in vegetable oil and no meat products are cooked in their oil. Order your food Animal Style for a delete!

<Text>I had no idea what animal style meant and the guy at the till spent the time explaining it to me for which I was very grateful. Then I proceeded to eat what was in the top 5 burgers I've ever had and all for $4.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< user_name>

Everytime I go it always has alot of people, and its only obvious that its always packed because the quality of there fast food is great. By far In-N-Out is the best buger spot compared to other buger places hands down. They need to expand to other places to meet the demand.</Review>< GmapID>

I like In N Out, the food is good and cheap. The only problem I have with this particular restaurant is that there isn't that much space to sit, especially if you go during peak hours.< /Review>

You see the name you know what to expect and what your getting. But expect a long wait if your in the drive thru. Other than nothing sets it apart from any of their other locations, but that doesn't diminish  their rating and quality.</Review>

(Translated by Google) The amburgers did not come out as I ordered them, I asked them with double onion, and they came out with some cooked onions, they are not hygienic in flavor, I was disappointed, they are my favorites.
