The office and everyone who works there are great.  The only thing that bothered me, is that because I'm a workman's comp patient they will not validate my parking ticket.  I don't understand why this affects them. I have to pay five dollars for every visit.</Review>

< Review>
Dr. Carlson is Top of the line Dr. If there were super doctor list like super lawyer list he would Be in the top 10. He listened carefully to my complaints and looked carefully at all my MRI'S. I am pleased with his recommendations for additional test to confirm his findings. I believe I am in great hands and feel confident Restore Othopedics in Orange County can solve all my orthopedic needs.  I look forward to seeing my orthopedic problems solved by their professional team of specialist.<//Review>

<Review>Traffic meant I was a few minutes late, but, as usual, the staff was  gracious and polite.  And, I was taken to an exam room in less than 5 minutes.  Support staff and X-ray tech were polite and efficient. Dr. Hasson was there as soon as the X-rays were done, carefully explained the films and answered all of my questions.  As I left, Dr. Carlson also inquired about my well-being.  From front desk to physicians, everyone here is phenomenal.</Review>< Pics>

I saw Dr. Carlson who was more than patient and helped me understand my options. I decided to go with an epidural for the pain. So far so good. The staff from getting my MRI to meeting with Dr. Carlson and during my procedure were amazing. Everything was explained and I was made to feel very comfortable.</Text>

<text>Dr. Eric Chang is a master of pain management. He has a variety of methods to help reduce and alleviate pain. If it weren’t for him I would never get a good nights sleep. If you feel like you have tried everything and nothing works, go see Dr. Chang. He has helped me get part of my life back and taken me from extreme pain all the time to manageable pain that I can live with. There are even days where I have little to no pain. Such a huge difference than where I started.<//text><userid>103736815959812697487<//userid><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_name>

Dr. Carlson, Lindsey and the staff at Restore Orthopedics are excellent! They got my son in the same day I called to help with his back pain.  Dr Carlson is extremely thorough, knowledgeable and thoughtful.  With on site imaging and their expertise I know my son is in good hands.  I would highly recommend Dr Carlson to anyone wanting to see the best spine specialist around!</Review>

Dr Germanovich is quirky, funny, and professional. He takes personal interest in all his patients and listens to their history and complaints. He truly cares. He is very knowledgeable and a doctor you can trust.
The center is conveniently located across from CHOC hospital, near the 22/57/55 freeways. Parking is validated first hour free.</Text>

Dr. Carlson is the BEST! I had a five hour back surgery on Aug. 27 only 10 days in rehab and went to work 5 weeks after the surgery.  I am healing beautifully and feel so much better thanks to Dr. Carlson, his PA Josh and all the other gracious, caring members of his staff.<//text>

I had 2 surgeries performed by Dr Gregory Carlson.  The first was a fusion for a bad back. After the surgery he
Came to my room and said the surgery went great. After the surgery I could hardly walk had a dropped foot and made me a cripple.  I am now wearing a
Foot brace and can hardly walk. He stated that my problem was a direct result of the surgery and he will stand by me until he finds an answer.  In late June I went in for a second surgery where he went to fix the problem and
Made it worse because now
My back hurts so bad I can’t even bend over to tie my shoes. And
He is not trying to help any more.   He basically ruined
My life. If anyone is thinking about
Going to him I would say run and find another doctor.</text>

Dr. Carson is so gifted in surgery yet so caring and patient in every step of the process. His "bedside manor" cant be taught, his care and kindness is pure. I travel from San Diego to see Dr. Carlson and his team (without regret) Dr. Carlson has performed surgery on my neck 3 years ago (100%) pain free and my back 7 months ago and I am feeling so much better heading towards 100% pain free. If you have to get surgery on your back or neck there is only 1 Dr. I would recommend to family or friends.<//Review>

The Restore Orthopedics and Spine Center runs like a precision watch, all your needs are precisely handled with care and you can trust that you will be treated special.

I have nothing but praise for Dr. Bederman, his skills as an orthopedic spine surgeon is outstanding. This man knows his business and went out of his way to make sure my surgery is successful.

Dr. Bederman’s team is exceptional, especially Teag Turner who made sure all my needs were taken care of, before surgery and after. Mr. Turner answered all my questions, which gave me confidence that I was in good hands.

I also want to express my appreciation for the excellent nursing care I received at St. Joseph hospital. A special thank you to Nurse Janine & Nurse Kelly for the caring way they treated me. They went beyond their duties to make me feel good, and safe. Nurse Kelly is exceptionally smart and I felt comfort from her knowledge knowing I was in competent care.< /text>

My 16 year old daughter was referred to Dr. Germanovich due to pain in her knees that other doctors could not treat. He found the problem and successfully treated her. She went from a 7-8 on the pain scale to 1-2, which is still decreasing. He gave my daughter her life back and I am forever grateful.< /Review>

Drs. Amin and Hasson and the entire staff took great care of me.

< Review>
Dr. Steve Mora and his staff have been my best friends through my numerous injuries related to a rear end car accident where the young lady who hit me was texting and hit me parked at a stop light.  Yes just like the TV commercial relating texting and driving to drinking and driving, it does happen so please do not text while driving.  It's the ones in the car you may hit that will thank you, if you're not texting there are a lot of thank yous coming your way every time you get behind the wheel.< /Review>

<text>Do your homework before you let the pain specialist doctors treat you. I believe they make the doctor's sell there  Products. The  Employee in the pain clinic treated me very bad. There are a lot of good reputable clinics out there that can really help. I don't believe they're one of them.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Review>A few years ago Dr. Greg Carlson performed a cervical fusion of C4-5-6-7 on me.  Shorlty prior to that he performed a major lamenectomy for my husband.
Our daughter in law is an eye surgeon in Washington state and wanted o locate the best referral of surgeon for us in Orange County.  After research she told us to use , yes, Dr. Greg Carlson!!!!  Dr. Carlson is conservative, doesn't rush anyone into surgery!  With study of our conditions, he indeed operated with great results.

Then, just last month, I had a serious knee problem and remembered Restore Orthopedic had a daily WALK-IN OTHO CLINIC.  I was in serious pain, and met Dr. Amin-knee specialist at the walk in clinic.  He treated me, ordered an MRI done right in the clinic, and again we found excellent patient care from Restore Orhopedics....we highly recommend their practice!

Speaking to a live person when calling in to make an appointment is almost impossible and the worst part is when you do make an appointment you end up waiting for more than an hour before your name is called!
However once you are being attended to the staff and the doctor (Mora) are awesome!</review>

I have seen many of the physicians and their assistants at "Restore."  Almost without exception they have been upbeat, positive andt extremely helpful. Unfortunately,  I have had to be treated for a number of significant orthopedic issues some requiring major surgery and others needing more minor outpatient surgical procedures.  They have all been successful and the follow-up has been exceptional. The receptionists and nursing staff are also terrific!  It is wonderful to find a team of doctors,  all in one place,  so devoted to their profession.</Text>

Dr. Carlson and the team are amazing. The RESTORE facility is beautiful. It offers the capabilities of an academic center, without the hassle of being transferred around the hospital and city. Dr. Carlson not only is a gifted surgeon, but a gentlemen who restores the patient\physician relationship.< /review>

Dr. Carlson is a warm and gentle human being that cares about his patients.  He has amazing skills and does his very best to get you the help you need to resolve the issues whatever they may be. My spinal fusion last year was such a success, I refer everyone to him now. His team is awesome with their follow up,  everything runs like a well oiled machine.< /text>

Dr. Carlson did an amazing job I had a spinal fusion done when I was 23 years old at the time a had a 1 year old which I couldn’t care for I was in so much pain I couldn’t do things a 23 year should be doing. I couldn’t  carry my own baby at that time I was taking Percocet and gabapentin. I did years of physical therapy. I finally decided to get surgery and I could have not chosen a better doctor it has been 3 years of my surgery. I am pain free and have a 4 month baby. I am able to work out and play with my kids. I am so grateful for Dr. Carlson and his physical assistant.</review>

<review>Outstanding services by Dr Hediah. I felt like I was in very good hands. I was on vacation when i went in there so i was not wanting to waste my whole day in a drs office. But the medical team did very good on getting me taken care of and on my way. The only tricky part was finding the entrance but the experience was worth it. Overall I would highly recommend this clinic.<//review>< Pictures>

Came here to see 2 different doctors, Gillman and Chnag. Both did not do much for me after visiting and getting many exams done. Wasted my time and money of over 10 visits. The doctors are not caring and speeds through the visits. Stay away and find doctors that actually care.</Text>

<Review>Perhaps no one can better inculcate good medical ethics into a young doctor’s mind other than himself.Which scenario is more of beneficence to a patient suffering from persistent pain – is it the lecturing about opioids or is it a discussion of where his pain is and its history?I got the former but definitely not the latter. Or should there be a good balance of both?Neither did I get that.My experience with Dr. Germanovich was very disappointing.He treated me like I was there to ask for more hydrocodon.A consultation should start with a doctor being compassionate with a patient’s pain.My main treating orthopedic surgeon knows very well that I have been trying to get away from hydrocodon.I also come from a family where many of my immediate relatives are doctors, specialists, and nurses.I could get the hydrocodon from them if I wanted to.But I did not.Instead, my relatives advised me to use it sparingly and only for severe pain and I followed my treating orthopedic surgeon’s and my relatives’ advice.So I went to this doctor hoping to find one who cares and would listen to my problems of constant shoulder pain.This doctor did not even want to listen to me. I mentioned to him that I was using hydrocodon and that my last prescription was December 21, 2017.He asked how many were prescribed and I told him 30.I told him that I was out by end of February.  That’s more than 2 months.I did not even utter the words that I wanted a prescription for hydrocodon.He was dismissive and lectured me on the dangers of hydrocodon.I have been lectured enough by my relatives.I have an uncle in New York who is a retired anesthesiologist, another uncle who is a general surgeon, a first cousin who is an orthopedic surgeon, a younger sister who is a doctor, first cousins who are doctors who have lectured me on the dangers of hydrocodon.I listened to them.I have used hydrocodon in the past because I had three surgeries on both shoulders.I was there with Dr. Germanovich hoping to find a way out of this persistent pain on both shoulders and away from hydrocodon.I felt that what was dominating in his mind was to tell me about the dangers of hydrocodon.It’s fine if he does so but I also felt that he kept a distance.He is mean-spirited and does not want to listen to anything else. He wrote on his progress notes that I was not interested in a surgery recommended by my treating orthopedic surgeon and another orthopedic surgeon's 2nd opinion last 03/2017.I did get that recommended surgery last 06/22/2017- my 3rd on my shoulders.The incorrect statement on his progress notes that I was not interested in a 3rd surgery was an indication that he did not read my medical history which I provided in a CD and his staff downloaded it into their computer. Diagnosing my constant pain would require thoughtfulness and a thorough medical history.In the consultation room, I told him that I did not get a benefit from my 3rd surgery and still have ongoing problems of pain on my left shoulder.He had an authoritarian streak and did not even bother to ask me where my pain was.He was cold and dismissive.He commanded the physician-patient interaction instead of a two-way interaction and it lasted less than 10 minutes.He is a young doctor with an idealistic advocacy of stamping out abuse of opioids.He  was just too consumed that every patient abuses opioids.In his hypocritical advocacy, some things were not discussed.There was no discussion where my pain was and if I had one or more areas in my shoulders where I have constant pain.He prescribed Gabapentin, told me how it was to be taken but did not even tell me what he was diagnosing me with.Am I not supposed to know?I read the literature that came with Gabapentin and learned that he probably diagnosed me with nerve pain which make me think I am self-diagnosing.Well, the Gabapentin didn’t work.Everyone deserves respect and to be heard.I went home feeling his mean-spiritedness and my own hopelessness with my constant pain.I am hopeful that his idealism will be tempered with the reality that not everyone is an abuser of opioids.<//Review>< UserId.>

At 11:10 AM I saw the doctor shooting the breeze with some pharmaceutical reps in front of the treatment rooms. At 11:15 he walked into another patient's treatment room. His staff was clueless as to when I may be seen by him. I gave up and left his office. Learn from my misfortune! ...Andrew< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Julia Gonzales</user_name><review>The drive alone is beautiful. It was a nice little hike along the trails. You can see where some of the grass and trees burned last year, but it was still beautiful.

<Text>The nearest coastal range park to the Central Valley. It has some steep trails with thick underbrush. Also regular park things like kids playground, big grassy area, tables and BBQs. No permanent restrooms, only portapotty.</Text>< GmapID>

<text>Pretty place would not recommend to someone who only wants to go to the park. The park is really small. But i would definitely recommend just for the drive and the view. It was so beautiful I enjoyed the ride the whole way there. I stop on the side of the road a few times just to take in the view and to walk around the mountains< /text>< pictures>

I enjoyed hiking and the trail. The kids had fun in the play area.  Its very dusty in some areas so don't use light colors.  there's a grassy area but its minimal. Its away from the city.  No stores or gas stations near by so fill your tank up before you travel and enjoy a picnic.< /Review>

I enjoyed the time spent in family. I absolutely love the playground. The trails are a bit steep and if you're not careful and wearing good hiking shoes you may easily have an accident. So please enjoy your drive out there. It's got beautiful scenery. Great for a quick getaway. Bikers love the curves so keep that in mind while driving in the narrow road. Wild life is abundant. Coyotes, deers, snakes etc. Enjoy!!!< /Text>

Used to go to this park 45 years ago, it certainly has changed over the years, for the better!
Aside from one point, the restrooms. The restrooms are horrible. Bring your own drinking water too!! The playground equipment is very good though.< /Review>

Great place to go hiking  around on the week end, or go there to do a camp and BBQ. Lots of native plants and rocks to discover here and close by. Every morning a large flock of turkeys and quail come through to find food. At nite a few raccoons run along the rock wall. Great place to stop and use the restroom before continuing on through the canyon.<//text>

<Review>This was a really nice park to go to for the kids. They have bbq grills and picnic tables. The bathrooms are there but we're not opened. The drive here is one of the only bad things about going here. The road is narrow, and random pot holes and dips. Also you will lose service going out there.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is a really nice park.  The kids play structures are nicely themed and it good repair.  The play surface is that squishy rubber foam.  A good deal of money was put into the play structure.  It is really our in the middle of no where, except for the nearby off road park that offers camping but was closed due to high fire danger when I was there.  Out front there are a couple of old painted and pealing signs saying that the water is not safe for human consumption, so bring your own water.  There is an old toilet house that seems defunct but there is a handicap accessible porta potty.  There is also an old baseball field.  This is a very hot area during the summer months.</review>< pics>

This is a neat little park along Del Puerto Canyon. It across from the Off-Road Vehicles park so it's not always quiet with the occasional ATV flying over the hills. They have been having problems with microbes, so there is no drinking water readily available, because sure to bring water with you. The toilets have also been closed and boarded up, presumably from the water issue and there are two pit toilets nearby.<//text>

<name>timothy warbington< /name><Time>1391115158647<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Frank Raines is a great place for all skill levels. There are easy trails that take you throughout the park. There are also the gnarliest hillclimbs that you will ever find. Although it is a small place you can ride all day and still be entertained. Great camping with full hookups for the rigs and bathrooms with showers. There is a hall that you can rent with a full kitchen and dinning hall. Grew up riding here, even made some of the trails. Disclaimer... don't go down a sketchy looking trail you don't know if your not up for some hard riding. Good news is if you break, no-matter where you are in the park you can walk back to camp in a couple hours tops. Rocky and dusty would best describe, unless it just rained in which case it's perfect.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Awesome to BBQ there, relaxing, playground and hiking! But the bathroom is the most disgusting filthy place, I dont think the park rangers have ever clean it or never will, so better use the bathroom somewhere before you go to Frank Raines Park. Very quiet and always windy but not that bad, it chilling. Mostly family friendly park.<//Review>< Pics>

I absolutely love the peace and quite out here!! The bathrooms leave a lot to be desired, I won't use them. But everything else is beautiful, especially the custom jungle gym. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤<//review>

(Translated by Google) The river is super clean, its waters very clear and the park is very good for children, I think camping in the mountains would be a good option because everything is very well maintained and above all very safe.

El rio esta super limpio, sus aguas muy cristalinas y el parque esta nuy bien para los niños,creo que para acampar en las montañas seria muy buena opcion pues esta todo muy bien cuidado y sobre todo muy seguro.</review>

I love the storage area. The security is so good here I feel my stuff is safe in this facility also the owner are a husband and wife team and they're really nice people. I highly recommend. They won't let your stuff be touched. They dont even let you go in until you out the gate code in which is added security.< /review>

<review>I have just resigned my position with Security Public Storage on Shaw and I just want to say that working with Robyn, Efrem, Tina and Kat has been an absolute pleasure. I highly recommend this establishment not only for all your storage needs but, also if you're looking for a career where going to work isn't a chore but something you love to do! (The pay is excellent too and so is their benefits package!) Their team-oriented atmosphere and friendly dispositions was a nice change to the lull of indifference that seems to permeate our job culture. I, personally, learned a ton from Robyn and Efrem and I wish them nothing but the best in their future endeavors!</review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1582573753388, 'text': 'Matthew- thank you so much for the kind words and we wish you the best in your future endeavors!'}<//resp>< gmap_id>

The managers are very nice and are always onsite to help with whatever is needed. Plus the managers live on site. I think. They are always willing to work with you.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a storage unit.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate>< Response>

<Review>I like the location of this storage because it's in a quite and less traffic neighborhood. I also feel safe accessing the storage at night because it's securely gated.  The managers live on site is another bonus I think. One minor thing is auto light tend to go off quickly when you're inside the storage and it gets dark when lights go off.< /Review>< pics>

Robyn & Efrem are the the best proprietors of this facility. They are professional, organized, and the friendliest couple you could ever hope to meet.  The facility is the only place in town open late (10:00 PM daily!). It is extremely well-kept and the units stay cool even during our extreme summers. Best place in town!<//text>

The managers are nice here. I could reserve my storage unit prior to moving in. This was a huge relief because I needed a storage unit near the end of a school semester, so I thought it would be a challenge to find one. I wanted a storage unit on the ground floor, which all units from this place are on the ground floor. The storage units are not temperature controlled and the Fresno heat is intense, so you should only store hard goods in here like furniture or bikes. I didn’t think about asking about that before, so there’s probably a few ruined things of mine in my unit. I think overall this place is fine.

I've been with Security Public Storage for 4 months  now and I have to be honest and say that I couldn't be happier. I feel safe leaving my belonging there and the staff have been very helpful answering all the questions I've had and the price is right. I  would recommend this place over and over again. Thank you Security Public Storage for your service.</review>

<review>Setting up a unit here was a smooth and easy process at a reasonable price. I really appreciated how this is kind of a family business and they live out here to help manage the property and make sure you’re things are protected. One time I forgot to lock my unit when I left and that same day they let me know! So they also check to make sure units are locked and no one can get in to steal your stuff. I’d very much recommend this place!!! They’re also easier to get to then the public storage under construction out by 99< /review>< user_id>

<Text>When I called for an inquiry the manager did a good job at assessing my needs. Rather than go with whatever size unit I thought I needed, he asked what I would use it for and more. Great place and very safe. They have always had an employee on patrol every time I have been there.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

I went to help a friend move stuff out and I was not impressed.   The halls were very poorly lit, it was hard to turn around inside.<//Review>

We have notified our maintenance staff so that we can get this taken care of immediately.

Since the first day I came in contact with Security Public Storage, it was a great experience. Robyn, right away was very friendly and willing to help with all my questions and concerns I had. Within a very a short time after she showed me around the property, units available...I was able to say to myself that, this is the place where I would store my things. From the beginning till now, my experience was and is above five stars.  Thank you Robyn and Stephanie for such a great job you're doing! And YES i would recommend this place to anyone I know.</review>

I’ve been with this company for over a year. They are one of the kindest and most understanding business that do the most for their costumers. Very organized and on it! Whatever goes on in the storage, they never fail to send a letter to let you know is going on. I would defiantly recommend this storage unit.<//text>

We looked everywhere at different units. When we first walked in we were welcomed by the managers and they were sooo very helpful i had so many questions and she was able to answer them all. They showed us units that we may be good for us. I would 100% recommend them to friends and family.</Text>

<Review>Robyn and Efrem are proactive managers that keep the property clean and secure at all times. The cameras are phenomenal, top notch security systems on every door, but it's the management team that sets the bar so high. I've stored at other facilities before and the quality service and security doesn't compare to SPS! Thanks for my peace of mind.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>This week I visited Security Public Storage on Shaw. Stephanie was so helpful in finding the perfect unit to accommodate my storage needs. All three facility managers were bilingual which was very helpful. Hearing about their security was very comforting, they feature alarms, cameras throughout the property, and they have an On-Site Manager Sebastian. J They told me they do pest control twice a month, which is perfect (No one likes bugs!). They have long gate hours 6am-10pm.(Awesome!) And best of all, no hidden fees! They called it their “Honest Price” includes insurance coverage of $2,000 (Nice!) and NO deposits needed. I had a great experience and would recommend them to my friends and family :-)</Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< username>

<Text>Great Place! Their staff is beyond accommodating. They really do care about making your moving experience an easy, smooth transaction. They had a clean property, easy access units. I really appreciate that they had better gate hours than other facilities 6am-10pm, because i often do work late. Stephanie and Sebastian are friendly and very willing to help, i highly recommend them :) Store with SPS SHAW< /Text>< pics>

Highly Recommend!
Great customer service (Thanks Stephanie)
Units  have monitoring systems to signify approved access
How many other storage facilities do this?
Very straight forward  - NO HIDDEN FEES!

<Review>I've been with Security Public Storage for about 5 months now and I'm very happy with the size and price they were able to accommodate me with.  The girls in the office were also friendly and professional.  The storage unit was clean and  ready for me to put my belongings in without worries. Very satisfied.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Doors were changed during our time renting a unit.   Staff were the only ones who could access our unit since we lived out of state.  When we cleaned out the unit a lot of things were missing.  We have always rented from this storage place in the past and never had a problem.  The staff has changed since we first rented and I think that is the difference in the security issues.

Yes, the doors were replaced previously;  however, the replacement of the doors was completed by a reputable company with one of our maintenance crew members on standby as witness with photos / videos taken of the project.\nIn researching your account, we found there was no alarm activity whatsoever between the door replacement and date of move out.  On the day of move-out, your husband paid a pro-rated amount – which caused the gate code to be disabled after 6pm.  Because of the 6pm deadline on the account, the manager continued to check progress to ensure that the move out would be complete prior to 6pm when they would be locking up the office for the day.  As the day went on, it was apparent that not everything would fit in the truck so the manager offered to open the dumpster which had just been emptied that morning.  Your husband then discarded various items and when the managers went to lock it back up that evening the dumpster was almost filled.\nIt appears to us that this is a misunderstanding between you and your husband.  I would like to add that you did have insurance on your space and that we encourage you to utilize it if you feel strongly that there was any foul play.'}</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I've been here for years, kind staff. Very content with the fact that the manager, Sebastian speaks both English and Spanish. Clean, safe and perfect to store your belongings. They have extended gate hours (6am-10pm) which is perfect for people who work during the day. Also, in a convenient location. Great amenities. Would recommend security public storage on shaw to anyone!< /Text>< username>

I could not have picked a better storage facility! The on site managers  Robyn And Efran are very friendly and knowledgeable about their company, and actually cared more about my storage needs, rather than just trying to get me into a storage unit. They listened to what I was looking, and offered a variety of options, and in conclusion,  they found me the exactly the right size storage unit I was looking for, for alot cheaper than I expected, that was a big plus!!! Great Staff,very well kept up facility, security cameras everywhere, what more could I ask for. They will always have my business, and I always refer to anyone inquiring about storage space. Thanks again guys.   Ruben.< /text>

Moved into the facility this past Saturday (4/9/16) with some items. We are relocating down south from Northern California in phases. The facility location seems good and good security.

When we opened our unit to start unloading we noticed two spots inside where rodents had gnawed their way through, probably moving from one unit to another.

My husband told the front desk immediately and they said they had extermination services on it.

We went ahead and moved in and as we did we noticed some rodent droppings on the floor. We are unsure how old they are.

After working incredibly hard to pack, load and travel the 4 hours to get there in pouring rain, we were too tired to switch gears to go look for another facility. We chose to take the managers word for it but have since been worried and uneasy.

We are withholding our review of the facility in a more positive light, until we feel really confident that the manager is really on top of it, as he said he is.

Sadly we will need to take a day now, that we really don't have, to drive down there to check on it, to make sure the manager is really 'on-top' of it.<//review>

<Review>My family has used this storage for the last 10ish years.  We have stayed because of the customer service and we just like it here.  The only and slight downside is that more recently the rent has gone up a couple times in the last 9 months which I am not a big fan of.  But besides that we just like it better than any other place we have been.  Plus they usually know who myself and my Gramma are when we call or come in and and greet us warmly.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I'm so glad I came to Security Public Storage the manager here is so understanding and it was very convenient where I moved to if I need to run over to my storage and get something out I can walk only less than 5 minutes away. The place is always neat and clean the hours are very convenient for access. The manager on site is so very heplful and a pleasant person. I feel my things are very secured also. I have been a customer since 2013 over a year now and I would recommend my friends to Security Public Storage.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

OSCAR RUIZ HAPPY TO SHARE MY REVIEW TO THE PUBLIC.
Security Public Storage on 2633 W. Shaw   has a GREAT SERVICE  over all.   starting from customer service over the phone, all the way to assisting in person right at the unit that I was looking for.
when I called  the service was great, they offered me many options .
They  care for  every single detail to meet more than the standars.
i definitely recommend SECURITY PUBLIC STORAGE .<//Text>

Security Public Storage on Shaw Ave. in Fresno has been a great storage place. There is easy access to our unit, with good security going into and coming out of the facility. The managers and office staff are always helpful and friendly, and have always been willing to accommodate our needs. I would highly recommend them!</text>

I had a wonderful experience with the staff at this location, I had to get an extra unit because the first one was to small, robyn was exceptionally helpful with showing us the units available, she assisted us with how much more space was needed, pricing between two units or one bigger unit, and with getting the two units close to each other.  There is always someone available to help with what is needed, buying locks, boxes, just a great place to do business, you just don't find that anymore.  I will recommend this facility to my family and friends.</review>

would give this place a -100 if I could because the couple managing this place are nasty and rude. Completely unwilling to help customers and act as if they are doing you a favor.</Text>

I am a paralyzed wheelchair user. The service I received from manager Stephanie Martinez was absolutely first class! She was knowledgable, kind, helpful and compassionate. The service that she provided to me went above and beyond what anyone could expect; her employer or customers. This location is very clean and I would highly recommend!!< /Review>

<Text>I have been using Security Public Storage for quite some time now and even at first glance it appeared to be the perfect place to store personal items. The grounds looked clean, had surveillance cameras and it looked almost immaculate.  The first night going there to store items, I noticed the neatness of the grounds and their attention to safety . As I drove past the office, I noticed that their surveillance cameras were on and the premises were very well lit.
The only glitch to this facility that I noticed recently is their lack of attention to their billing. My bill had gone overdue and instead of the facility sending  me a warning notice such as "we have placed our lock on  your unit's door for none payment",  I found out the hard way. After driving out there on a late night, I was rejected at the gate. The error message on the gate said; "Entry suspended due to non-payment" so my going out there was futile. Had I known that they had taken this type of action, I wouldn't have attempted to go out there, especially at night.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>I love this location! They showed me several spaces and made sure I was happy with the space I got. I wasn't sure if my things were going to fit in my unit and they told me that if my things did not fit they would gladly move me to a bigger unit! Very friendly staff! Will definately come back next summer when I need to store my belongings.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><Response>None<//Response>< Pictures>

<review>I have stored items in several locations and found that
Security Public Storage to be the best by far.

Very convenient and very friendly staff. They are very fair and diligent in making sure I pay, and are good about reminding me to pay so I don't have to pay late fees. Only reason for 4 stars is the price is higher than ideal.</text>

Love how clean this storage facility is. All staff members have been courteous and helpful and I can't tell you how important that is to me and how difficult that is to accomplish in my eyes because I have high expectations always.
Dennette has always gone above and beyond to help out inany way possible Thank You all so very much< /Text>

Security public storage was very helpful and accomodating.  We had a small storage space and then we realize that we needed a bigger one.  They didn't hesitate to offer a bigger one within minutes.  I would truly recommend Security Public Storage on W. Shaw to friends and family.

<Text>I have lived all over the Western United States and have often used storage facilities.
I was delighted to find my most pleasant experience at SPS of Fresno on Shaw Avenue! The facility is clean and the staff (Denette, Abe and Beth) are over the top friendly and helpful. I would HIGHLY recommend using this facility for all storage and

My husband and I love this location.  All units are ground level which makes it so much easier to load and unload our belongings.  The staff is so polite and professional which is a plus.  Our unit was clean and the right size for us to moving in everything we need to store.  Having an alarmed unit and an on-site manager is even better.  We don't have to worry about someone breaking into our unit.  As I am officially retiring and will be out of town for a while, we know are belongings will be safe and waiting for us when we decide to empty our unit and move on to "greener pastures!"  Thanks, SPS, for being here.

My sister and I rent a small 4x4x8 unit in Fresno, CA and since we live in Colorado Springs, Colorado now it's quite difficult to get our payment in on time due to us living separately because of our disabilities, but SPS had gone to great lengths to help us get back on track! I know that many other companies would NEVER HAVE DONE THAT! Especially with my sisters deceased husbands Urn & ashes being in the storage unit accidentally! We've been with this great company for almost 2 years come February '17!
Thanks to SPS for everything! And good luck America with your upcoming election! May the best wolf - win or lose.. Amen!
Sincerely Gregg Johnson - For H004 & with sibling Dianne Englund..</Text>

<review>I have been with SPS at West Shaw Ave in Fresno CA, for over 2 years 3mos. The management have always been kind and considerate. SPS will explain the rules well. SPS sends out closure date and time notifications before holidays and they will email statements and your receipts for your proof of payment and personal file. They will take off the insurance charge if you have our own Personal Property insurance. (Usually included in private Renters/HO Insurance). SPS will also add a beneficiary to the unit if needed; as I did with my son. They also sell premium locks and other items one may need, and at a great price. I thank SPS on site management for their kindness and helpfulness, especially when I consolidated my units. They have patience and understanding.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I had to store some household items a few months ago because I was going to be away for a couple of months receiving medical treatment. SPS was close to my home--10 or 15 minutes away--and it looked well-maintained. They gave me a substantial discount for the first six months' rent because I was a first-time customer. The facility is clean and well-lighted and I've been able to communicate with them via email or phone. They've sent paperwork such as my contract and invoices via email since I have not been able to return to Fresno in person. Denette, the manager, always responds to messages promptly and has been very helpful. I'd recommend SPS to anyone looking for storage space. Your possessions are safe and the staff is easy to work with.</Review>< rate>

We do not have any current or previous customers with your name. and do not have any construction ongoing, all our units are individually alarmed and maintained in permanent working order by quality managers that live on site & we have no rodent issues - the facility is inspected regularly for issues such as you mention. Please feel free to visit us and see what a well-kept and secure storage facility can be.'}<//response>

<review>Unit assigned was filthy.  Area around unit was filled with trash, construction material, and construction waste.  Construction waste could pose potential hazard to customers.  Alarm system not intact.  Believe there may be problem with rodents.  From what I have seen it is the worst storage facility ever and I have been to a lot of them.  Management needs to clean up this dump.<//review></record>

<Review>I recently had a very challenging situation arise in my family involving my 90+ year old grandmother, a broken hip and the need to sell and clear her 90 some years of life's accumulated posessions from her house.  The team at SPS made what was a terribly emotional and contentious situation tolerable by going above and beyond the norm in terms of their attentiveness to our specific need for storage, and their investment of their time in being thorough with us and making sure that what they had to offer would be adequate.  I couldn't be more pleased with the service I've received from the two gentleman and one lady I've had interaction with.  I've never felt rushed and even when other customers have been present I've felt that I had the full attention of whoever was minding the store.  I cannot think of a situation where a need existed for storage in which I wouldn't recommend this company.  They go above and beyond the bland corporate landscape that's become acceptable to so many of us for simple lack of any other choice.  Well done guys.  Keep it up!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I have been doing business with Security Public Storage for almost a year now and they are very accomadating, professional, and thier customer service is great. Most of all, I love thier gate hours because sometimes I need access to my storage during the late hours and thier gate hours are still open when almost all the other storage places are already closed for the day. I would definitely recommend Security Public Storage to my friends and family.</Review>< user>

security public storage is very clean, neat, and the staff is very nice. they are very accamodating, and helpful when things with got stressful with moving. ive dealt with other torage failities, and they are rude, AND try to charge you for every little thing possible! i would never regret renting with them, in fact i would do it again. GO WITH SECURITY PUBLIC STORAGE!</review>

I was recently needing storage for my extra and large belongings that I couldn't keep at the time, due to unforseen and sudden changes at my residence. Thanks to Security Public Storage and they're ability to work with my needs and my situation, I was able to get things moving again. I even felt safe when I saw how protected and secure the place was, and thanks to their whole package with letting me rent the U-Haul for especially heavy items, I was able to feel safe, secure, and get everything I need done and then I could get my life back on track. I would like to mention the kindness and courtesy of Dennette Covarrubias and the new assistant manager Deanndra Covarrubias for being sensitive and prompt with my situation. Thank you again, I suggest checking them out yourself.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>(Translated by Google) I recommend Security Public Storage why? It is economical, the best price I found in the city only one charge per month and my insurance is included payment month by month without contract something that I found very convenient. Safety is my priority and I have it in this town apart from being a very clean place and the administration service is impeccable !!

<Review>I love this place! They give sensational dishes, their menu is decent, The chef in that place is well trained, I enjoy a lot eating all their food. The food is consistently tasty, the service towards the visitors  is good. I often go to  this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it with no hesitation.< /Review><Time>1600278207097</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><gmapID>0x80951b6f4aad9019:0x12b896f703ee93fc< /gmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures><username>Ridge Aguilar< /username></record>

I visit this place a lot since I work right next to it. I like how their service is always awesome and they keep the place well organized all the time. Pricing is reasonable and they serve sizeable portions.</text>

Very slow waitress payed more attention to the group of men there than the other patrons. 1 waitress was not ok there should have been at least 2. Carmen was our waitress before and she is truly the best.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) A month ago I came to eat at this place, all very good, good food and now I come back again because I liked it and I brought some friends to eat and the food very bad, I do not understand what happened, before ordering the food I asked the waitress was the same cook and she said that if everything was the same ... of the 3 people who went nobody liked the food it didn't taste good the rice was very acidic and it seemed that it had a lot of water The shrimp I ordered did not taste good and the sauce was very bitter ... I don't know what happened to their food, they really should pay more attention to how they prepare the dishes ... I don't think I will return to this place ...

Hace un mes vine a comer a este lugar , todo muy bueno , buena comida y ahora regreso otra vez por qué me gustó y traje unos amigos a comer y la comida muy mala , no entiendo qué pasó , antes de ordenar la comida le pregunte a la mesera si era el mismo cocinero y me dijo que si que todo era lo mismo ...de las 3 personas que íbamos a nadie le gusto la comida no tenía buen sabor el arroz estáva con un sabor muy ácido y parecía que tenía mucha agua , los camarones que pedí no tenían buen sabor y la salsa estáva muy amarga ... nose qué pasó con su comida la verdad que  deberian  poner más atención en como preparan los platillos .... no creo volver a este lugar ...< /Text><rating>1</rating>< Resp>

The lady refused to tell me the price of the cake I wanted instead she said she will get back to me and they had baked the kind of design I wanted for someone else before from the catalog they gave me. So I wondered why they said they couldn't give the price maybe because am black. And it's over one week and they haven't called me.</review>< Pics>

This place has everything for baking! They have fondant and tins and measuring things and all the things. It's a cute spot with friendly staff and did I mention they have all the things? If you're now an expert baker from binge watching Nailed It! on Netflix, just like me, then this is your spot.< /Review>

First time at any type of spa and they are amazing! You get a free drink while you get your feet done and the staff is super friendly and the foot message rock things is to die for!!! I am going to take the hubby so he can get the heavenly treatment like i got!< /review>

<text>I felt very welcome from the moment I walked in.  My friend and a had a seat out in their private courtyard, with tables and umbrellas, sipped our champagne while we waited for our turn.  Best pedicure I have ever experienced.  I opted for the deluxe spa pedicure, with aromatherapy, salt scrub and paraffin dip.  Can’t wait for my next visit!<//text>< Pictures>

I've never had a pedicure before Steve's Spa, but believe me when I say this was a spiritual experience. Staff is friendly, fun, and it really feels like there is nothing outside of that paradise while you're there. One of the most relaxing things I've ever done, 10/10 would recommend and will be coming back.<//text>

My pedicure was done well and the lady that helped was very sweet. My problem is with the acrylics I got done. They were done by Steve himself and they came out uneven, chunky and the glue is very visible. Steve was very distracted and unfocused. He was quite rude as well. He did not try speaking to me and just pointed to me when he wanted my hand. Another girl complained while I was there about her nails as well. First and last time coming.</review>

I went to Steve's spa yesterday and I cant Express how impressed  I was. After having a horrible experience at another nail place a few weeks ago it was so refreshing to find a high quality  place to get my nails and pedicure done. Even though it is high quality they are very reasonably priced and did a AMAZING job.
I didnt get there till about 20 mins before they closed,  Steve took me with no issues. Did not rush and made me feel at home. The staff was amazing and so friendly. They had a list of beverages to choose from and gave me a delicious bowl of fresh watermelon to snack on. If you live anywhere even remotely close to Steve's spa I would highly recommend going there.  You will not be disappointed. I will definitely  be going back.</Text>

This place saved our night! We had made reservations elsewhere and we were cancelled on. Steve made time for us ON THE SPOT. I couldn’t be more thankful for the way they treated us! They have so much to offer and their prices are great! They accommodated a party of seven at the last minute! Everyone should check them out if you’re looking for somewhere to get a manicure or pedicure in lakeport. I am so so THANKFUL for them!</review>

The people who work here are really nice and the Ice cream is really good. They have a pretty wide selection. Unfortunately, most of the frozen yogurt machines dont work 0r just don't have anything in them anymore so there are like 3 flavors. Also the sandwiches are kinda pricey (I think it's like $8 for a sandwich and more if you want certain things on it). The interior is cute and they are still a great little business ❤</Text>

Very popular with locals.  Good selection of sandwiches.   Small but good selection of ice cream and frozen yogurt.   Very clean.</text>

<text>We stopped near here to meet as a group for a nearby hamburger joint on our way to a camping trip, but stumbled into this place. I was amazed at the variety for a sole proprietorship. Quality options, not just cheap unpopular selections. The sandwich menu has both tasty specials and completely custom options. Both have generous portions.

The owner was very pleasant and sincerely hospitable. I also chose a milkshake... Which was also delicious, and the presentation a level above your typical 'stirred ice cream in a cup'. I enjoyed it so much I returned the next day on my way out of town!< /text><Name>Jim Brown<//Name><Time>1533700766156<//Time><UserId.>107781681668714645099< /UserId.>< GmapID>

< Review>
Amazing Handcrafted Sandwiches, so tasty! BUT...

...expect a 20-30 minute wait, minimum.
Call-in ahead, or plan to be here a while. I've been waiting for my 2 to-go sandwiches for 25 minites now. I had a similar experience on my first visit, didn't ask for pickles, got'em though, the dark haired woman had to re-make the whole thing.
-->NOTEWORTHY EDITION:
Today Samantha was attentive, professional & polite. She works quick and as efficient as possible being understaffed, without her this would be a 1 star review due to the wait-time and improperly made sandwiches...
Cause WOAH,
UPDATE:
2nd visit, and out of 4 sandwiches, only 1 of 4 was correctly made; 3 had to be re-made.
Samantha did her best today being overwhelmed with orders and NOone to assist her. I work 40 minutes away, this round trip cost me a lot in fuel and wages too.
I ordered at 12:45, left at 1:30 , got to the job site and returned to  SCOOPS by 2:45....
Just took me 2 HOURS to get the sandwiches I ordered and another 40 minutes to get back to work. My boss waited almost 3 hours for lunch, MY fault of course; thanks SCOOPS, just delivered a 3-hours-old sandwich to the boss, I'm entirely unimpressed.
I asked Samantha to re-make them considering this is their second mistake in 2 visits and I'm 40 minutes away. She instead, "fixed-it-up" for me, guaranteed they wouldn't be soggy because they go light on condiments at SCOOPS. Well, tomatoes, n such made the sandwiches so soggy by the time I got here, and we've had so much trouble eating them, that after a few soggy, dissatisfied bites we decided to NEVER order from SCOOPS again.
75% failure rate, (that's like, worse an F- )! At least the woman re-made my sandwich on the first visit.

I would be more inclined to visit again if there is sufficient staffing, or at least an owner on-site during lunch rush.
I'd like to be able to add stars to this review cause the food and staff is quality.< /Review>

We were not even hoping to find this kind of place when driving through Willits. Here we enjoyed excellent ice cream, sorbet and frozen yoghurt. What a fair and flexible idea that you can serve yourself at the sorbet or frozen-yoghurt tap and pay per weight!<//text>

<review>We really enjoyed this venue for our December wedding. We originally planned to have our ceremony at a different location but we had to change last minute because of the weather but ended up being able to have our ceremony outside on the patio area. The greenery surrounding the patio is nice so we were happy with that backdrop. We had the dinner inside and it was definitely intimate with 56 guests. I'm glad we ended up with that number because with any more people it probably would have felt crowded. The bridal room is very small, we did not use it to get ready, but even with storing some of our bags and other items it was cramped. You have to use an approved caterer. We used Culinary Excellence and they were great! There is not a full kitchen on-site though so they were cooking in a tent out in the parking area. This venue allows beer & wine only, no liquor. The interior and exterior are nice enough on their own so we really didn't need to decorate very much to make it look nice. It's a very nice property considering the low cost to rent.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNX0USAQEPU2D5PpwopM_QOqSdu20zHSOHcN636=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQbszJafVtf8EDMkHfnQPXo10uFQRPLQjBjPVX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPo8OShFrpIXQRinwtrcnorotgSKQZMh1SW1B3P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Rating>4</Rating>< name>

Great event Urban Night. Informal and fun, plenty to see and do. Should have had more seat around the bad though. Or a stage for them. They were good but no where to hang near them. Lived all the food options.< /Review>

We didn’t need a platform for our ceremony because the patio was already surrounded with beautiful natural scenery. the view of the lake was beautiful. They had a small room for the bride to get ready. And a nice space inside. There are two restrooms. And it was handicap accessible.

The only tips I would give is if you are having an out door brunch/ lunch outside get something to create shade. I had my poor guests eating for an hour out in the direct sun. And the Music can’t be too loud so it was hard to hear the music when I was preparing to walk down the isle.

The brides room is directly attached to the shared bathroom(which means there is no private place to use the bathroom while preparing.  and that specific door locked the bride In Her room so be careful.

I was also really upset the waterfalls that were a huge selling point for me were not turned on during the day. So the wedding pictures I had hoped for I couldn’t get. That made me really sad.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<review>Love this EBRPD rental facility.  Sweeping views of Lake Temescal, gas fireplace, plenty of space. Beautiful!

If you book the Beach House, remember that there is no eating tools (silverwear, napkins, paper plates,  serving utensils,  cups, chaffing dishes), which is OK if you are prepared for it.

The facility itself is very nicely maintained.  I would love to host a party here.

Did I mention there is a waterfall in sight? Lovely.< /review><Time>1544798083811</Time></record>

We are having our wedding ceremony there, size is my only gripe... any event over 50 people with furniture is tight. Otherwise beautiful outdoor setting.</text>

<Review>Great option for running. The landvale station trail (the paved trail next to hwy 13) loop from the parking lot to the south entrance is almost a perfect 1 mile loop which makes it great for HIIT or tracking your distance without GPS or fitness watch.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1525809266881< /Time><rating>5< /rating><text>(Translated by Google) The place is beautiful to start you pay 5 dollars entrar to enter park your car but in if the entrance to the park is free it is your option if you want to look for parking outside you do not pay anything.

We continue you enter the park it is beautiful to walk 🚶‍♀️ definitely but to swim I do not recommend it because the water is too dirty there are many places for you to make your roast meat do something nice with the family but the most beautiful thing is to walk look for it through the forest 🌳 there are such beautiful places that give you a lot of tranquility and peace ✌️

If you want to go swimming you have to pay to enter something that I don't know why but I can't find the logic but it belongs to everyone

It is definitely beautiful and you do not pay anything when you enter there as I said and this option if you want to pay to park inside

I highly recommend it 😁😁😁👍👍👍👍🌙🌙🌜🌜🌟🌟🔥🔥🚵🏼‍♂️🚵🏼‍♂️🚵🏼‍♂️🚵🏼‍♂️

El lugar está hermoso para empezar pagas 5 dólares 💵 para entrar estacionar tu carro pero en si la entrada al parque es gratis ya es tu opción si quieres buscar estacionamiento afuera no pagas nada.

Seguimos entras al parque está hermoso para caminar 🚶‍♀️ definitivamente pero para nadar no lo recomiendo por que el agua está demasiado sucia hay muchos lugares para que hagas tu carne asada hacer algo bonito en familia pero lo más hermoso es caminar buscar entre el bosque 🌳 hay lugares tan lindos que te dan mucha tranquilidad y paz ✌️

Si tú quieres entrar a nadar tienes que pagar por entrar algo que no se por qué pero no le encuentro la lógica pero ya es de cada quien

Definitivamente esta hermoso y no pagas nada al entrar ahí como dije ya esta opción si quieres pagar para estacionarte a dentro

Lo recomiendo mucho 😁😁😁👍👍👍👍🌙🌙🌜🌜🌟🌟🔥🔥🚵🏼‍♂️🚵🏼‍♂️🚵🏼‍♂️🚵🏼‍♂️< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWC-KOoLECNouBiq9VrxwXAqPDjhSooJDCLUXM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCH3HgmG0eX9YplybDhH-P9k_7RQMZpISg8JHe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONoEXjEl58WjgUWFU3wmEy05GUujT5XONsPO38=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcjMBqRSqIER3Bo1Prp7p7-6IESmojSNzG7Kfs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJTjOoFbVuyvhK4vlS1FVsgON8s2TpNKcY1kMz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80857c133fffffff:0xb1e0874be061c557<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place seems to be a true reflection of San Fran, groups of homeless huddle behind, with a film noir green lake and giant jarred square concrete pipes spewing water every which way. And surrounded by brutalist buildings from the front.<//text>

<review>I was disappointed that this fountain seems to have been left unmaintained. It was dirty and the water was yellow from algae and dirt. The local area is also run down with a large homeless camp near by.< /review>< date>

It IS art, and it HAS a meaning, but it is in the wrong location. Dismantle it, relocate it elsewhere, and in its current place, build a performance stage with aesthetic designs having ties to the San Francisco Bay Area.< /text>

(Translated by Google) On November 11, 1987, U2 performed a free guerrilla live. With about 20,000 people gathering, Bono sprayed "Rock N Roll Stops The Traffic" on this huge sculpture. The situation is contained in their movie "Rattle and Hum" (Japanese title "Rattle and Hum").
Although the artist Armand Vaillancourt, the creator of the fountain and sculpture, was generous, the act was controversial, Bono apologized, and the letters were erased.

1987年11月11日、U2が無料のゲリラライヴを敢行。約2万人が集まる中、Bonoがスプレーで"Rock N Roll Stops The Traffic（ロックンロールは交通を止める）"と書いたのが、この巨大な彫刻。その様子は、彼らの映画"Rattle and Hum"（邦題『魂の叫び』）に収められている。
この泉と彫刻の作者のアーティストArmand Vaillancourtは寛大だったものの、この行為は物議を醸し、Bonoは謝罪して、文字は消された。< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The fountain created by the Canadian artist Armand Vaillancourt officially bears the name "Quebec Libre!".
The idea for a fountain by Vaillancourt came from the imagination of Lawrence Halprin, a well-known landscape architect. In 1968 he announced that the fountain to be created by Vaillancourt would be considered one of America's "great works of civil art". After the installation of the artwork in 1971, however, the (expected) criticism did not fail to materialize.
Vaillancourt himself saw his work as a confrontational work that could serve as a magnet for protest and contradiction.
It should be noted that Interstate 480 thundered past here in 1971. The area has long since been redeveloped and the Bay Area has become a highly frequented area.
At first sight the fountain appears like a chaotically thrown pile of square concrete pipes. However, the chaos is not accidental, it was thought through by the artist to the place where it should be. Today it is provocatively free, the relieving newly built highway standing on pillars in the back. From this perspective, the fountain itself is ideally placed in the picture. Usually, however, you stand directly in front of the plant, which is up to 12 m high. From this perspective, the challenge is of course different, putting it in the sense of the construction, maybe confusing at the moment.
I personally like the cubic work from all perspectives.

(Original)
Der vom kanadischen Künstler Armand Vaillancourt geschaffene Brunnen trägt offiziell den Namen "Quebec Libre!".
Die Idee zu einem Brunnen von Vaillancourt entsprang der Vorstellung von Lawrence Halprin, einem bekannten Landschaftsarchitekten. 1968 verkündete er, der von Vaillancourt zu erschaffende Brunnen würde als eines von Amerikas "grossen Werken der bürgerlichen Kunst" angesehen werden. Nach der Installation des Kunstwerks im Jahr 1971, blieb die (zu erwartende) Kritik jedoch nicht aus.
Vaillancourt selbst sah sein Werk als eine konfrontative Arbeit, die als Magnet für Protest und Widerspruch dienen könnte.
Anzumerken ist, dass 1971 hier die Interstate 480 vorbeidonnerte. Heute ist die Gegend längst saniert, die Bay Area eine hoch frequentierte Gegend.
Der Brunnen erscheint beim ersten Anblick wie ein chaotisch hingeworfener Haufen an Vierkantbetonröhren. Das Chaos hat jedoch keine Zufälligkeit, es wurde vom Künstler durchdacht auf den Ort hin wo es stehen sollte. Heute steht es provokativ frei, die entlastende neu gebaute Autobahn auf Pfeilern stehend, im Rücken. Aus dieser Perspektive ist der Brunnen an sich ideal ins Bild setzend.  In der Regel steht man jedoch direkt vor dem Werk das bis zu 12 m hoch ist. Aus dieser Perspektive ist die Herausforderung natürlich anders, das hineinversetzen in den Sinn der Konstruktion, im Moment vielleicht verwirrend.
Mir persönlich gefällt das kubische Werk aus allen Perspektiven sehr gut.< /text>

<Review>George & Giovanni are excellent...I can not rave about them enough.  Any review that claims that they don't answer their phone all the time and call you back right away....obviously don't realize how busy they are!  and a place that is always busy...is a place that is doing something right!  I say to them, go down there and pull a number and wait your turn...and see the level of customer service you get...you will be blown away!!!  I'm a homeowner and a property manager, so I'm use to dealing with supply companies.  I'm usually the only woman in the place, and get treated with a less than desirable level of customer service.  They ordered a Kohler tub for me that is poorly wrapped from the factory, so it was dinged and scratched, so they ordered another and when that also came poorly wrapped...they decided to order me three of them so I can find one that was in good shape.  Worked like a charm!  Best thing was that they have a huge selection in stock in their pamonia warehouse so delivery time was only a few days.  The same tub I ordered twice from Lowes and it also came poorly wrapped and was scratched...but the difference was each tub took 3 weeks to get from Kohler.  I can not recommend them enough...I love that I found a great company to use in the future!!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>
{'time': 1584390822695, 'text': "Addie, thank you for the glowing review of George, Giovanni, and our Hollywood location. We love that you found us too, and we're glad that we were able to get you a tub that matched exactly what you were looking for. We hope that on any future projects we will be your first and only stop, thank you from the team here at the Hollywood location."}<//response>

<Text>Service couldn’t be slower. There is a few competitors out there that want my money so I decided not to wait 30 minutes to pay for a few dozens of copper fittings and went somewhere else. I’ll admit the fact that I keep coming back but I promise it’s only when I don’t have another choice.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>I dont know how these guys still in business.
This place has 0 customer service skills. Everyone here are so arrogant and doing you a favor just helping you.
It's such a shame. I wish someone already will open plumbing supply chain it will be so easy to put these guys out of the field.
This is what they deserve Unfortunately.
And I'm a GC. Hate coming here 🤢</Review>< name>

Very disappointed of the employees, according to today they had no electricity and they were closed and they did not take care of me but they took care of another client who seemed friend of them. It does not seem fair to me.</review>

Avoid this place at all times. I showed one of the guys at the counter a product I need and he come to with a completely wrong part that doesn't look at all like the piece I gave him then he has the nerve to tell me "this isn't my first day on the job."  This ferguson location is a joke.<//text>

I went to this location yesterday with my son. We ordered the sirloin steak with loaded mashed potatoes, the spicy Asian chicken salad, the broccoli chicken alfredo with cork screw pasta and a slice of the strawberry cheese pie. All costed about $65.00 including tip and we had leftovers that fed us today for breakfast and lunch. I'll definitely come back again someday.< /text>< Pics>

They make great pies at this place! Banana creme pie is my favorite. Ample parking at the back of the restaurant, clean place. The only thing that requires attention and improvement is customer service.

When I stepped inside and lined up at their To-Go counter, the staff were both chatting and took 5 minutes before giving me any attention. No greeting when you  come in, no one saying, "I'll be right with you." They are completely aware that you are there, but ignores you. Yeah, I should've walked out of this place.

The couple who were seated at the reception area were baffled at the amount of time it took this place just to have their order done. Slices of pies (2) and a cup of ☕. How long should the staff take to fulfill that order?  20 mins? 30 mins? Ha! I was surprised, too.<//Text>

Really disappointing.  Used to love the Chicken Tortilla Soup.  But now its turned into a creamy 3 Bean Soup.  No chicken that I saw.  Could not eat.  They changed the recipe.  Also portions r smaller.  But pies still great...smaller slice though...<//Text>

<Review>Like many establishments, they've setup outdoor dining. Menu is a code to scan on the table. We enjoyed a couple of new items on the menu. The half rack ribs with shrimp and 2 sides and the half rack ribs with chicken. Sauce had a nice flavor, bit too spicy or too sickly sweet. Meat was "fall off the bone" cooked. Coleslaw was crispy fresh, not too vinegary. Also had fries, and that is where plating issues come in. If you put a bunch of fries on the plate and then a rack of hot, juicy, BBQ ribs on top of them, what's going to happen to fries. The ones underneath are soft and soggy. The coleslaw came in a separate small dish which kept it's juice from spreading out underneath the fries as well.
But overall, it was a very good lunchtime break and I would recommend it.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>We have been going to this place since the 90's.  It is the only surviving store at "the grove"... This restaurant serve food similar to Applebee's, Chili's, Denny's etc...  We like dining at Coco's because of the great service and pies.  The generous parking lot is a big plus too.  The night manager, Kendra (who was also our waitress) did a fantastic job taking care of us.  It was a busy day, but she managed to maintain composer and served us and other patrons with a smile.< /review><UserId.>115145454323238543671<//UserId.></record>

This was my first time eating here. It was the best breakfast food I've ever had in a restaurant. They're definitely better than ihop and Denny's by a long shot. It feels homey, the prices are great, the food was delicious, the customer service was on point. Vivian was our server, she did a great job.</review>

<Review>My daughter got sick shortly after drinking the Apple juice at first time at this particular location. I thought maybe it's because we don't drink the brand of juice.....or whatever so I gave it another shot.

In terms of service overall the waitress was polite and timely and the food was brought out with normal decent wait time. In terms of smell upon entering the building: you can tell it's an old building either that or they don't properly wash the mood and towels etc because of the musky smell.

In terms of food I was a little disappointed as I ordered the chicken avocado rolls and saw there was no avocado...apparently it's inside. *you'd be able to taste still if that was the case and in this....it was non existent. The drinks were good and The soup wasn't salty this time. The best part is their bread. I'd say that's the only thing you can't really go wrong with. The macaroni noodles also had Brown on them which proves that the bottom of the pan had to have been burned or overcooked. I also pray that the grey fuzz in the bowl of cheese wasn't mold.< /Review><UserId.>111489564071816005097</UserId.><user_name>Candyce Raiford<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Breakfast was superb! I forgot our server's name but she was definitely hospitable. Reminds me of a Filipino mom that would make sure that you help yourself with food. She was definitely accommodating. One piece of cinnamon roll was definitely enough for two people. It was about the size of my hand. I also ordered smoked gouda and gash omelette. The side of potatoes were definitely flavorful! Add some cholula on these babies and you'll definitely fall in love with this!< /Review>< pics>

Ordered food online, specifically cheeseburgers with bacon and a side of salad - we received burgers with no bacon, they didn't taste like they were flame grilled, and dressing for salad was not what I ordered. Bad experience, especially on our cheat day, which happens once in awhile. My husband and I, we both are very disappointed.< /text>< Pics>

Excelente place
Buy be aware when you pay your bill because one of the waitress always write on your bill the tip she wants, so if you leave the tip on the table you will get charged again at the counter
On this bill the waitress add  aprox $60.00 plus $40.00 cash (That we left on the table) I noticed that until I got my credit card statement, I guess it was too late to do something about it.</review>

<review>I have gone to this restaurant for quite sometime. Since I haven't been there in awhile I decided to order food today. Wrong idea. The baked potato was old and hard as a rock. The steak was a little tuff. The strawberry pie was awful, it had a crust that appeared to have been added and not baked together.
So I give today 2 and half stars.< /review>< pics>

Coco's has updated its menu again. There is a large selection of food choices. I had a melted cheese sandwich with a small salad and a cup of tortilla soup and it was very good. The prices are reasonable and the service was good.</review>

Very upset with the service I received that day.. The waitress was nice but the food took forever to come and we still never got our complete order. All I ordered was oatmeal 2 sausage links and 2 pieces of toast... The only thing I got was my sausage they kept telling me my oatmeal and  Toast was on its way. My son ordered oatmeal and fruit..all he got was fruit, my friend ordered Eggs and toast..all she got was the eggs.  The only 2 orders that came out right but took for ever was the :) pancake and the hamburger. We sat for an hour waiting for food that should have taken less than 30 minutes. The restaurant was not overcrowded And I wasn't in a rush when we went in but I did have something to do that day.  I've been in this Coco's before and they are usually pretty good... The waitress kept telling us I don't work at this one I usually work at Denny's. I may go back but this won't be my 1st choice.<//review>

<Text>The best Harvest Pie.  I ordered Two Harvest pies because that is my familes favorite and I always give one of them and then I keep one for myself and don't think that the minute that I got into my car I did not open up one of those pies and had a couple bites. Thank God I asked the waitress for a set of plastic silverware. 😁< /Text></record>

The prices were resonable also. Been to a few of these restaurants before, but I feel that they have been pretty consistent over the years. So that's a good thing. You don't see many commercials about this and restaurant, they really should advertise more, then maybe they would have more business. Still Happy with the meal, so that's what is important.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Name>Linda Sandoval< /Name><date>1558407373358<//date><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Came here to have brunch with my two young daughters, we got seated right away. We were glad to see it wasn’t busy at all. The hostess told us our waiter would be with us soon and we waited for 30 mins and no one ever came. for someone to come attend us. A waitress came and served the table behind us and not once did she come and ask us for our drinks or offer any type of service. At one point I got up and took my little one to the bathroom, when I got back I noticed all the workers were just chit-chatting away behind the counter not servicing anyone. I went back to my table and told my daughter to grab their things so we could leave. This was the worst service ever. Never coming back here again.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I ate here a few times about 10 years ago. And then I stopped going for no particular reason. Today, I was in the area with my son and decided to swing in.

The hostess wanted to sit us between two occupied booths even though many of the tables were empty. I had to suggest a different table so my son and I, as well as the other diners could have a little privacy.

The food was ok. The blue cheese was weak and a little vinegary. Like the took a bottle and watered it down. My club was made with stale bread. It was supposed to be toast, not crouton like hardness.

Service was ok. Was going to have pie while we were there, but the other food killed my appetite.  I love the pie. But I like it at Marie Calendars too.<//Review>< pics>

I wasn't really all that impressed. My fiance and I had dinner there. We both ordered prime rib. Both of our prime ribs were more fat than meat. It wasn't very good. I had mashed potatoes that were barely warm and the portion very small. Even the vegetables were not hot. Overall the dinner left alot to be desired. So I didn't want to take a chance on any pie. It was very disappointing for the price they are charging. Shameful.</text>

Amazing breakfast options and taste! The service was good but the food took a lot of time to arrive. Apparently there was just one chef on a busy Friday morning.< /text>

<review>Easy Parking. Clean lobby. Lots of available seating (weekday lunch). Lunch entrees range from $9 to $12 (and then more for seafood and steaks). Service could have been more enthusiastic / faster. Food (mushroom and swiss prime rib hamburger) was hot and tasted good. Ordered a pie to go (Coconut Cream) and had some immediately at home. It was delicious. I am giving 3.5 stars because it's what you would expect at a restaurant. Certainly not bad (1-star) and nothing to write to Mom about (5-stars).<//review><Date>1469738900338</Date></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I used to go here a lot with my family. Then I saw a huge rat sitting right outside of the restaurant. This thing was sitting beside a pipe that lead into the restaurant. I was so disgusted my entire hungry family left. We have tried to give this place a chance so many more times after that but every time we just end up walking out. The place always smells like heavy duty carpet cleaner and it invades your nose the second you walk in. I will never go to this disgusting place and for your own safety and health I recommend you don't either.</review>

They need a whole lot of improvement there's only one or two good servers the rest of them not so much they don't give U bread until after 11:30 before back in the days whenever you showed up at Coco's you would just like Mimi's. It'll be automatic .you will get your basket of bread.< /review>

<Text>Waited 10 minutes for them to even take our drink order than the server walks by like I'll be right with you while filling everyone else's water and coffee around us .... I've been a server since I was 15 .. you dont fill others drinks when one table has been sitting for 10 minutes and hasnt even gotten water and you guys are not even busy in the slightest . Work on that please . Food is slightly below average to me got the Benedict.... also dont get the fruit unless you only want cantaloupe because that's all they have .<//Text>< userid>

They don't set their employees up for success. Sometimes their don't give them a busser, and they have to run and clean table, take the guest's orders, answer the phones, take to go orders, run back and check on their guest, etc etc, clean tables etc etc. All the while we, the customers are waiting<//review>

Wow!! What a big disappointment.....This place is so under staff in the entire restaurant....The kitchen needs more cooks...Clearly there are not enough waiters & servers...it's just a mess in there....It's so sad....There is a section on the left that is always empty because they never have enough employees to cover it??? How do you run a business like this??..The lobby is packed full.....I see customers walking out the door....I wonder if management even knows??....Nobody seems to care anymore...This restaurant is in such a great location so they really have a captive audience here....Too bad the place is run so poorly.....I won't go in anymore...& I tell my friends, clients, neighbors & co-workers don't waste your time going into Coco's anymore....Check your numbers people, sales must be down & this is why!!!<//text>

<review>We waited 25 minutes for our order and nobody was here.  I dont know what took so long. Customer service was bad. They seemed to have an attitude and somewhat sarcastic. Floors were dirty and over all the experience i had was not good. Sorry cant recommend.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Overpriced for the quality of food.  Had the hash browns....ok, well I ordered the hash browns.  their idea of hash browns is home fries.  nothing wrong with home fries but they are not even CLOSE to being hash browns.  Food was just mediocre, and not worth the inflated price they charge.  Waitress took our drink order and while she was gone to get drinks, a waiter came and was taking our food order.  Waitress comes back and snaps at waiter "this is my table"....ok, if he is poaching the table for sure say something but not right in front of the customers.  I'm sure it was an honest mistake.
I'd never been to a coco's before, and need to never try them again.  Just too mediocre and there are many amazing options elsewhere.
I didn't try their pies, but they had a "strawberry pie" that, i kid you not, was a pie crust with strawberries in it, and probably some strawberry sauce dribbled on it, not an actual pie.  Kind of made me laugh (just commenting on this, the pie that i did not try did not affect my star rating).</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80d956cba9642e25:0x7cecc8c65a7e707c<//gmap_id></record>

I use to go to the Coco's in La Mesa all the time, it was wonderful! Unfortunately they closed 2 years ago and I am forced to come here. I usually like them but I had a poor experience on Thanksgiving.

I called to see if they were doing slices of pie because, my mom was in the hospital for the holiday unexpectedly and that was all she wanted and I had already driven around town. Apparently pie is some huge secret because, Katie could not tell me what pies they had. I did the drive all the way down to Coco's from the hospital in Mission Valley only to find out they didn't even make the pie I was looking for. I had told Katie my situation on the phone, I didn't want to make a drive for a pie that didn't exist. She made it seem as if this pie was there. Once I talked to her again and told her what was going on she said, "aww poor baby." very sarcastically, insincere and dismissive. I wanted to cry because, it's just my mom and I living here in San Diego and I'm just a kid trying to manage all of this and give my mom a holiday meal while she's in the hospital.

Once I got into the back area where they were distributing pies (I figured I'd just buy a whole pie, take a slice and give the rest away). They didn't have much left by noon but told me to come back in 4 hours, that's a sick joke. I did talk to a nice woman working and told her my story and she was so sweet about the situation and made recommendations. Miraculously the slice of pie that KATIE told me didn't exist showed up! I appreciated the lady who helped me and another gentleman (guest) for helping me out but I felt that Katie was playing with people's emotions and I didn't appreciate it whatsoever.

Not surprised by Katie's dismissive attitude because, I witnessed her one time saying something explicit to a cook in Spanish. She even admitted it and asked if I spoke Spanish and heard her.</review>

"sides", she told me the heading on the menu; I was already looking at it. I asked her to find it for me. She couldnt. It wasnt
there. No apology offered. We have been served by her many times; but this experience waa BY FAR the worst. She was smug, unfriendly, and distant. Never got a sincere greeting.

<review>The service was good, and the recent infusion into the bread prior to the menu, "The Biscuits" where art though?? The staff supporting the customers here work their rear off running back and forth from that kitchen, keeping that food fresh when it comes to your table, and if theres a problem, their on top of it with a friendly and courteous manager backing them, and ensuring people leave with a smile!</review><UserId.>111277264222045838056</UserId.>< username>

<text>There is a horribly foul smell throughout the entire restaurant like bad plumbing. It gets noticeably worse when approaching the bathroom. From other reviews it appears to be a documented problem that they are unwilling or unable to fix. Real shame as it's the only location left in SD.< /text>< Rating>

< Review>
Gabriel was our servier and he was wonderful. I am one of those customers who ask for the impossible never fails.. I love the asain chicken salad and it was on point but then I saw the cibatta chicken bacon sandwhich and I asked if he do a split and he made it happen and I was one satisfied customer the food was sure yummy.. I sugguest trying both. .. Thanks again Gabriel for excellant service :D</Review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) This is usually a very friendly restaurant
But today when we arrived and checked in, the boy who attended us was very kind and told us that there was a waiting line. We sat down to wait and a girl Maritza without saying good afternoon! Hi! Or an excuse me. She was very rude and told us to get out and wait outside. Very unpleasant and poor customer service from this girl.

(Original)
Este suele ser un restaurante  muy amable
Pero hoy al llegar y checarnos el muchacho que nos atendio fue muy amable y nos dijo que había línea de espera. Nos sentamos a esperar y una muchacha Maritza sin decir buenas tardes! Hola! O un disculpen. Fue muy ruda y nos dijo deben salirse y esperar afuera. Muy Desagradable y pobre el servicio a cliente de esta muchacha.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The price is accessible. But the service is appalling. I went to eat in an hour of little clientele. For the waitress to arrive, we wait 20 minutes. The food took 1 hour to arrive and it was cold.

El precio es accesible. Pero el servicio es pésimo. Fui a comer en una hora de poca clientela.  Para que llegara la mesera esperamos 20 minutos. La comida tardó 1 hora para llegar y estaba fría.</Review>< pictures>

<username>Ingrid Montalvo</username><date>1473487720191</date><Rate>4< /Rate><review>(Translated by Google) I went to dinner with my husband and the waitress was flirting with him as if I didn't exist ... I ordered lemonade and the others put it on the table and I was in the corner away from me ... When I went to pay I left a note In which it said: zero tip for flirting with my husband.
That waitress was also the cashier .. I'm sure she read my note and I hope that next time she will be respectful.

Fui a cenar con mi esposo y la mesera estaba coqueteando con el como si yo no existiera... Pedí limonada y a los demás se la puso en la mesa y ami en la esquina lejos de mi ... Cuando fui a pagar deje una nota en la que decía: zero propina por coquetear con mi marido.
Esa mesera era también la cajera.. Estoy segura que ella leyó mi nota y espero que la próxima vez sea respetuosa.< /review>< pics>
