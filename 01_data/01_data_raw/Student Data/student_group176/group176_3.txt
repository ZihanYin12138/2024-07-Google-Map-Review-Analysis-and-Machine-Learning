Amazing food and service! I had a question on a certain dish and Sonia herself came out, offered samples and then gave me a suggestion to try a specific dish....which I went wit, and it was sooooo good! I've lived here 14 years and never been there until tonight, but we will be regulars from now on!< /Text>

We ate here on a hot summer day. It was nice and comfortable inside for our lunch. The food was terrific and the hostess was even better. We took my son there, he is a long line truck driver and wanted a good Mexican restaurant. He eats all over the U.S. and loved it here. We all love hot, spicy food and some dishes they can tailor from mild to really hot and spicy.< /Text>

< Review>
This restaurant  is newly remodeled.  Has a nice bar and big flat screens for watching sports. They  have a great top shelf liquor  selection as well as a good selection if tap and bottled beers. Lets get down to  the food......
I ordered the steak burrito  smothered  with red sauce and  cheese which included beans and rice. Everything was fresh and had good flavor. Chips were fresh and warm,  salsa fresh and had a little  kick but not to spicy,  it was also very good and couldn't  stop dipping! The ambiance was quite enjoyable, and the staff is friendly. Great for  a dinner date,  work lunch or  for a family  night. Over all one of  the  best Mexican restaurants in Tracy, Great I know  because  I've been  trying  them all out!  There portions are enormous so be prepared to  take home a doggy bag.  I was surprised I couldn't  finish my meal. Why are you  still reading this?  you should be driving to Sonia's!!!</Review>

Very nice Mexican food restaurant. Friendly well trained staff. Located at Grant line and Tracy Blvd. in Tracy, a prime location. There is a bar and several TV's. Karaoke on Monday nights 7-10. Family friendly, bring the kids.</text>

Me and my boyfriend are both vegan as well as new to Tracy, and we try not to cause too much trouble when we order in places that aren't conventionally vegan. Unknown to me and him the owner and chef, Jordan, goes vegan for lent and she personally came out to make sure she got our order correct, even if it wasn't necessarily on the menu, she also brought us an appetizer that she made vegan for us on the house. I can't begin to describe the amount of respect I have gained for this place, not to mention the food was tasty, fresh and the homemade guacamole/salsa is delicious! Excellent customer service, great tasting food, and really nice environment. Definitely recommend.< /Text>

<text>Devon, Kevin, and Sonia went above and beyond for my son! They put on cartoons, on their own, to keep my 3 year old occupied. They also brought him "treats" after dinner and even gave him hugs! The food was amazing and it was a clean and positive environment. Definitely recommend and will be going back!< /text><gmap_id>0x80903d50217fb405:0x9a2741c4e2cd570a< /gmap_id>< userid>

<review>I tried to order Nachos 38 minutes before closing as I pulled in so they could start the order and instead of saying they weren’t taking anymore orders for the night she said they were closed. Open sign on, hours state until midnight, people inside and still taking DoorDash orders Online, but I’m told you’re closed. I won’t be coming back.</review>< Pictures>

<review>We used to frequent this restaurant in the past! Unfortunately the business suffered a fire, and when they reopened they acted like they had never saw us and the service from management was lacking and unfriendly! Very disappointing! The food was still ok but, cold! The bar is in the middle of the restaurant and is very noisy! However, the bar patrons get excellent service and attention! We won't be back!!! And I'm sure they don't care!!!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>I usually get really good food and service at this place. However, I was very disappointed the other day when for the first time my wife and I placed a to go order. My wife called thirty minutes before I showed up to the restaurant, however when I showed up the order had not even being send to the back get started. I had to wait over fifteen minutes for the order to be done.< /Review>< Pics>

If I could give this place 0 🌟I would... Their customer service was horrible. Wanted a Friday special on a Friday and a vegetarian burrito to go and waited 45 minutes before my vegetarian burrito came out. We asked 5 minutes before how long would the wait be and we had to ask twice before someone told us another 5 minutes. 5 minutes came the vegetarian burrito came out however the Friday special did not they said that the cook just started cooking it. We were from out of town just wanted a good dinner before we went to the hotel to rest. There were only 2 other people eating so why did our food take a half an hour to be put in? Why didn't they say that it would be longer than anticipated. Also on my Vegetarian burrito I asked for sour cream and guacamole and was charged for it however when I went to get a bite there was no guacamole and sour cream. I asked the gentleman do you guys have my sour cream and guacamole on the side and he stated that they only had sour cream no guacamole. I'm so confused whlettuc  you charge me if you knew you didn't have any. For $8 I was so upset it was not that good, small portioned, rice was hard as if it was old, no lettuce. All the host and bartender act as if we were wrong for speaking up. So mad and I'm Still hungry< /Review>

<Review>Just moved to Tracy yesterday, and this is the first restaurant we've tried for Mexican. Being from the central valley, I have a certain flavor and style of Mexican fare that I prefer, and Sonia's hit them all perfectly! I've had Mexican all over the US and Europe, and I can never find this quality. They may call it Pueblo food, but it's my favorite.

1st- The amazing bartender made the BEST Cadillac margaritas I've had in years. PERFECT. The service was FANTASTIC ALL AROUND, and we even got a chance to thank the chef.

2nd- True test one= perfectly seasoned and cooked rice and beans. Must've been homemade, nothing from a can tastes that amazing.

3rd- True test two= I always order a chile relleno to judge the quality of a restaurant. I can't say enough things about this. The sauce was phenomenal and done correctly, I like the added addition of peas. The chile was cooked right, and stuffed with cheese but not overwhelmingly. Egg batter was spot on.

4th- Normally I do not like carrots in my ground beef. I didn't even NOTICE THEY WERE THERE in my enchilada. It was so good, I couldn't have cared less, and actually finally understood the reasoning of flavor mix after having it here.

5th- PORTIONS. Had we been able to stop eating, we would have had a lot of leftovers! My husband ordered the Cancun Platter. Unless you have two stomachs, order with caution! However, my skinny husband ATE THE ENTIRE PLATE.

So, if you enjoy food from the central valley, you will adore this place. And even then, try it anyway because it is worth it. We will be going back for dinner this week! They even have daily specials, tv's, fun Taco Thursdays where they make homemade tortillas and you make your own tacos. I can't WAIT!!!

Thank you Sonia's, you are FABULOUS.</Review>< Pics>

This review is specifically for Manon, although I'm sure the rest of the staff is also great. We called to schedule an in-person self-guided tour one morning with someone else (didn't catch their name) and Manon called a couple hours later to follow up. She was super friendly and professional and seemed genuinely interested in making sure she understood our needs and got us a perfect fit. On the day of, she got to know us a little better and then gave us a map of the property for the self-guided tour. She color-coded different spots, gave us clear directions to them, and told us to call if we got lost. The place seemed pretty cared for and we loved the security measures. We ended up choosing a place closer to work but were considering making a longer commute because of Manon. She provided the best customer service and we wish every housing complex had someone like her!<//Text>

<Text>I love our unit. When we moved in, it was absolutely spotless and they had even freshly painted everything so it felt pristine. The location is great- perfect distance from both freeway and beach and right next to Sprouts. The staff, though, is what makes this place really wonderful. The maintenance staff is always helpful and friendly. The front desk staff, particularly AJ, Nicole, and M, have been super helpful in addressing any issues I've encountered with the most professional and friendly manner.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Jacobo Gonzalez was very nice and super fast at fixing the sink and he was able to unclog it. Also, he was very helpful in anything else that I needed which was the stove plates replacements. He has always been great and fast at any job task assigned to him. 10/10 5 stars!!< /review>

<username>Caitlin Patla< /username><Time>1620932091128< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I love Regency Palms. The property itself has a very home-like feel unlike newer and more luxurious properties that feel like a hotel. I really love the courtyards in the center of each little cluster of units. It's so refreshing to return home from a long day of work and see a pretty green courtyard with big trees and healthy grass.

I have lived at RP for 13 months and I have just renewed a 12 month lease. I love the staff - Nichole and AJ are both extremely helpful and prompt in responding to any concerns.

Maintenance staff is stellar also - I've had two issues within my 13 months, one being the doorbell needing to be fixed (did not ring inside the apartment) and the second being a bathroom light which needed to be replaced. Within 24 hours both issues were taken care of. This is during COVID too! No delays.

The location is great as well. I am close to everything I might need. Bella Terra is right down the road, plenty of gas stations, restaurants, and grocery stores within walking distance. We also get a nice ocean breeze year round 😎

I love Regency Palms. I'm glad I'm still able to live here.<//text>< pics>

<review>The leading consultant Ms. Glennon was very helpful, professional and all around wonderful. The regency palms apartments are run by a professional and efficient property managing company, that takes pride in creating a safe environment for their residents. They take parking and safety very seriously and constantly have security monitoring the place. It also comes with a pool, laundry site and parking spaces. Ms. Glennon made the leasing process very easy and simple so that me and my roommates could move in as soon as possible. She is very nice and open to everyone. I love it😊</review><Time>1617242010107<//Time>< Gmap_id>

My husband and I moved in October 2019. We received nothing but warm welcomes and smiling faces from the ladies in the front office. Corinne and Kim are a huge reason why we love living here so much just because of their hospitality. Last month we decided it was time to upgrade to a bigger place (since we were in a 1 bed 1 bath). Long story short, we put down a deposit to another complex and eventually backed out because Corinne and Kim were able to find us something better (not even 50 feet from where we were living). So we ended up moving to a townhome here and we truly couldn’t be happier. If I need maintenance done, they always come through the same day. If I need literally anything, the front office management always finds an answer asap. Living here feels like a breath of fresh air to say the least - and we couldn’t be happier.< /Text><date>1594069172070<//date></record>

<review>I lived here for one year.  This was a few years ago.  The reason I give it two stars is because it wasn't great.. But it also wasn't a nightmare.  There were so many dogs.  And they constantly barked.  I had three dogs underneath me, two dogs next to me, and an annoying weiner-dog diagonally. Our carpet pulled up, so what Maintenance did was get a slice of brand new carpet and stitch it on. So the carpet was basically two tone.   There were dog droppings all over.  No air conditioning.  It was so hot.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1594081810241, 'text': "Hi, Dan.

<text>From the moment my girlfriend and I stepped foot on this property we got that nice warm feeling that we found our next little home for us and our 2 puppies all thanks to Kimberly.  She greeted us with a warm smile and showed us a few different apartments until we found the one we liked.  Kimberly helped us every step of the way and even made the application process fun when it can be nerve racking for some people.  She is very knowledgeable about the apartments and answered every question/concern we had.  When inspecting the apartment with us, she was very diligent and wrote down every note/concern we had and addressed the situation right away.  This complex has nice green grass, trees and plants and everyone we have met so far has been really nice and welcoming!  The pet policy is amazing as it was something we worried about having 2 large dogs.  I would 100% recommend this place 10/10 times.< /text><userid>103031295688873099873<//userid><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

My experience with living at Regency Palms has been nothing short of excellent. The staff is always accommodating to any needs required, especially staff member Corinne, who consistently displays complete professionalism and care towards the residents. She has always projected kindness and friendliness unto myself and my family, as have the other staff.
Maintenance staff stays on top of the complex, inside and out. Grounds always look beautiful and pleasant to come home to.
Definitely a great place to live!</Review>

We just moved here and it has been wonderful! Everyone including our neighbors (the whole block) have been so friendly, the laundry unit being so close & available is amazing and I submitted a ticket to fix a few items in our apartment and they were fixed by the end of the very next day! Quick, fast and amazing service! Definitely a place I can call home for a long, long, time!<//review>

I lived there on and off for 8 years. The current team is one of the best that they have ever had. We moved out recently and my son continues to miss it and talk about the memories he made there.
We loved the multiple pools, and the walking convenience to the library and school.< /Text>

<Text>I moved here in Dec 2014. The staff was very friendly and helped me make my move easy. What I don't like is the parking situation. You only get 1 car port and 1 parking space outside which needs a permit so that means no guest parking. It's understandable I guess but what sucks is that at night there are so many car ports empty and parking spots are full so what the heck. Anyways, the other things I dislike is that there are so many dogs and children here. I can hear everything that goes on outside my window and it sucks. The kids are running around and screaming on weekends and the parents just let them. The laundry room is convenient though, never had a problem and always clean. Overall my apartment never had anything that had to be fixed and I would say its clean here. Would I renew my lease? No. Would I recommend anyone to live here? Sure maybe if they work mornings and weekends so they wont be woken up.<//Text>< time>

I lived here for over a year and a half. During my first lease, my apartment totally flooded during a severe rain storm, and they moved me to another apartment, but they only compensated me very minimum amounts despite the fact that I was out of my home for 2 1/2 days! Plus, when it rains, the entire front common area by the leasing office, floods so bad that the water comes past your ankles. I moved in on the 2nd of the month, when I was rained out of my apartment they did the new lease start date on the 9th of the month, (without my consent), and when I gave my move out notice for the 9th, they told me I had to make it for the 11th, (because they don't do move outs on the weekend, thus, making me pay an additional 2 days.) I gave them back their keys on Saturday, the 9th, but I had paid through the 11th of the month. I cleaned the apartment BEFORE I left, and I did not do any damage to the walls, but when I received my security deposit statement, they charged me for painting and cleaning, as well as a early lease termination fee, (never mind the fact that I had paid at the beginning of the month for the 1st-11th.) I am lividly angry with the management because I have NEVER been a problem tenant, and I even tried to roll with the punches when a lot of my personal property was severely damaged or destroyed when THEIR apartment flooded during the rains, and I was displaced for days. All they did was rip me off and act like it was their right and it was OKAY!!! Their apartments are outdated, (except for the few that they have recently updated since my 1st apartment flooded), and this complex is well overpriced! There are quite a few apartments in the Huntington Beach area that will accept your pets, including the apartment complex right next door to Regency Palms, I would seriously suggest you look to one of those, and skip Regency Palms, because the only REAL thing that they have going for them is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! But, nothing else!!! And, FYI, when it was time to renew the lease, even if I had signed a new 1 year contract, they wanted $200 more a month, and if I decided to go month to month, it would have been $500 more per month!!!! I have lived in several apartment complexes throughout Southern California, but I have NEVER had an apartment complex go up so high when it came time to renew a lease!!! My word to you on Regency Palms is, "Tenant Beware!"< /text>

Moving in went great! Jem and Shawn were both helpful, the experience was quick and easy. I'm a returning tenant since I liked it here so much the first time. They worked with my schedule and the team communicated with each other well, showed me around and explained everything. A nice bonus is that this apartment came with a fridge so you don't have to worry about buying something big and expensive and bringing it in. It all went well, thank you! (:</text>

Appliances out dated and only partially working. Spider webs and nests everywhere under eves and roof tiles. Security is either non existent or towing vehicles at will. Upon move out was harassed to stay and charged a ridiculous amount for repairs. Was there for three years never a missed payment and they still want more money after deposits. I guess when someone is a good tenant they take as much as they can. I highly recommended not moving into this complex. If I could give a no star rating I would.</Text>

My fiance and I are new tenants, and I'm happy to report that everything has been amazing! The location is perfect. Jemma was extremely informative and thorough throughout the entire process. She and Corrine have done so much.

Our 2 bedroom apartment is awesome! We havnt had any issues thus far. It's super clean and everything looked brand new when we moved in. We're so thrilled about making Regency Palms our home!! 💜</review>

While no management company can predict how a tenant will be 100%, the current staff here has done a great job of assuring that we have great neighbors with respect for the community and for others who share their space.  The occasional bad neighbor is always something that happens when you are apartment living, but the RP team seems to have managed to keep that to a minimum.

They have a great Maint staff that does all they can to keep a very aging property, vibrant and alive with quick turnarounds on reported issues and pretty solid grounds keeping in general.  RP may not have all the most modern amenities in the units, but they are by no means falling apart or in bad repair.  I constantly see the staff here working to improve the property and maintain it while still offering a fairly reasonable (for a beach city in Southern California) rent rate.

The staff is friendly and go out of their way to know their residents, especially those who go out of their way to help build those relationships.  You cannot force people to be open and understanding, but the demeanor of the staff here, enables those who choose to have those connections with staff, are enabled to do so.

My wife an I have happily lived here for almost 6 years now, in several units, 1 and 2 bdrm, and have been very happy since day one, but never more than we are with the current staff!

No apartment complex is perfect and nowhere will ever have 100% satisfaction with all of our neighbors, there are just too many personalities in the world for that, but RP does a pretty good job of building a friendly and safe community for it's residents...with very few exceptions in our experience!

< review>
this apartment was a in a good location for me. Close to the beach, work, stores. Other than that for $1520 a month to live in a place with out dated cabinets that look like they have been painted over to many times already. Hinges had been painted over, the door didn't close right. After i moved in most of the paint started to peal off that had just been rolled over. Floor in the kitchen was that old school tile and no matter how much you would clean it, it never looked clean. No vent over the stove. Every time i tried to cook something that created some smoke the fire alarm would go off. had to open pretty much all the window and the rear door to vent the apartment. When I  moved in I noticed all the plugs in the house were worn. I tried to plug in a fan and the plug would fall out. There a fire hazard waiting to happen. Good thing they changed them all for me except one. If you like spiders than this is the place for you. They are everywhere. I would wake up in the morning with bites on my arms. I would find them hiding in the carpet, bathroom. As for people living around me I didn't have to much trouble. The parking is limited so having a few friends over is out of the question. Unless they want to park across the street on by the auto parts store and walk. After moving out I was charged for cleaning and paint. So don't expect to get  your deposit back. Not to mention if I would have stayed my rent would have gone up by 100 dollars. all in all great location. To bad rent is to high for outdated apartment. I have lived in a equity apartment in Arizona and I have to say it was a way better experience than this.</review>

I do like the calm and greenery here.  Though the construction is more than 45 years old and has plenty of problems, the front office staff and maintenance staff are wonderful and go out of their way to make sure we are comfortable and all issues are addressed. Especially in recent times when they seem to be under-staffed and over worked!

My special thanks to Jessie, Ryan, Eric (maintenance) and Jemma (front office).

Though most service requests are attended to promptly, there are times when important tasks remain in the backseat.  Like the main pool repairs which was supposed to take a week from Apr 10, REMAINS closed till this date (May 8).  I'll update this post if it takes longer yet.

My sincere request:  PLEASE INCREASE YOUR STAFF.</review>

Blessed Owner, Management, Maintenance team and  neighbors.

Thanks to regency palms

We absolutely love our new apartment in the Regency Palms Apartment community. We had our reservations at first, concerned about living alongside so many others in this 310 unit complex. We were assured that we would be happy, but if for any reason we decided it wasn't going to workout for us, we were given a 30-day satisfaction period from our move in date to change to another available unit OR to move out, No Harm No Foul, should we decide. Well, needless to say, we are VERY happy and wish to stay for a very long time
.
This IS a dog friendly community, but we ourselves are NOT dog owners. Regardless, they are no bother, but instead a joy to watch...and play with when the opportunity arises. There are green belts all through the complex so whether it's to walk your dog or just for taking an evening stroll with your loved ones, the grounds here at the Regency Palms have beautiful , well-kept landscaping and big beautiful trees to offer shade on those hot summer days. There are Doggy Waste Stations strategically placed all through the complex to help keep the grassy areas as clean and sanitary as possible. I see the Orkin man here every week inspecting and treating all areas and issues that may cause a problem if gone unattended. Due to there diligent and professional work, this community is bug free. I haven't seen one critter in over 2-months.

The Leasing Office Staff, including their maintenance and cleaning crews, have been an absolute blast to deal with. I've had a service request or two that I needed assistance with. Once reported to the Leasing Team, our issues were quickly and efficiently dealt with keeping me a happy & content camper :) Their five (5) laundry room facilities are always clean and available. The washers are bigger and less expensive than the Laundromat across the street in the shopping center. Trust me, we've checked. And speaking of local shopping & recreation, the Regency Palms is located within walking distance from grocery stores, Home Depot and lots of other much needed services. Very convenient! It's a miles walk to the Library, Central Park, AND Goldenwest College, and not to forget the Westminster Mall.
I have made some good friends already and all the people who live here are very nice. One of my favorite things to do here on a hot day is to go lay out, get wet and socialize poolside, in any one of their 3-well maintained pools + Jacuzzi. When I'm out enjoying the pool area, It's just like being at a Palm Springs resort.

In closing, let me just say this.........."If you are looking for a great place to live and  haven't checked out The Regency Palms yet, What Are You Waiting For?" Call and set up an appointment for a tour by one of their fantastic Leasing Agents. I promise , You WON'T be let down! :)))</Review>

However, they will raise your rent by $180 or more every year you renew the lease. It's like pulling teeth getting maintenance to come out, you have to keep calling them over and over again ot bothering them to get someone to come out. Once you finally get them there, sometimes a week later than they said they'd be out... They'll take care of your issues. But a few days to a week late. I would move right now, but we can't afford it. And they know it.

Bottom line: Be prepared to pay nearly $200 more every time you renew your lease. This place sucks. Also, not enough parking spots for the Tennant's and you WILL have to park on the other side of the complex sometimes if you don't get the garage port. They will also tow any guests vehicles if they are not in your spot. Parking is a total nightmare here.</review>< Rating>

<rating>5</rating><Review>The staff at Regency Palms apartments at 6762 Warner Ave do an excellent job.  The leasing consultants do an excellent job and are very knowledgeable.  I can also say the same about the property manager.  The maintenance crew also does an excellent job.  When you call in for a repair, it is taken care of in a very timely manner.  Property mgr. Nicole Mesa.  Leasing consultants: Corine Kirby and Kim Powell.  Maint. Mgr. Jessie.  Maint. personal: Javier, Minoa.  Their are two others but don't know their names.  It dosn't matter, as I said, office staff and maint, do an excellent job.

Would not recommend moving in this neighborhood complex. Not worth what it costs to live here.Flea ridden, allows pets but I wouldn't suggest it unless you want fleas on you and your pets.<//text>

Great looking complex and it deserves special consideration for being pet friendly and customer service. We met Manon on a Saturday morning and after a brief interview, she recommended us multiple units that would fit our need. After this we took a tour of the establishment and after the tour she has been helping us day and night with any of our questions and updates. I was impressed on how organized and responsive she is, even on Sundays and sometimes on holidays "M" usually would reply within minutes, this helps alot because the website sometimes doesn't work but having "M" to give us feed back makes everything okay. Due to this excellent customer satisfaction we can't wait to move in here as soon as the unit we want opens up.</Review>

I'm leaving, and I took off the mask as I'm walking out.  I see you itching to tell me something, so I tell you not to worry, I'm leaving.

You say "good".

Listen kid.. you'll look back at this one day and realize you were lied too. I'm not sure who I was infecting with no one even close to me but my family. But you do you. Your attitude wasn't required though. And for that, I will never buy a Skechers shoe again.

Learn respect for your elders.<//review>< pictures>

I like the store a lot, my son and I both have wide feet and there's a decent amount of wide selections.not a bad place to get a couple pairs of shoes for just a little over a hundred bucks< /Review>

<Text>I would give this place five stars if it were a self service store. It was neat and tidy. But I was trying to exchange a shoe and am not familiar with the brands sizing. I couldn't get the associate to put her phone down from the important call with her boyfriend. Even when I finally was able to get her attention, she didn't hang up. In the end I got the shoe exchanged. The lack of concern on her part is a loss prevention persons nightmare. Go in with an open mind and you'll be fine.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x809add1369a3784f:0x1301d6e29b033d68</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Wouldn't honor rewards.  Told me they won't look it up. I shopped there 6 times last year (every other month) to get shoes and they always have honored my phone number for rewards.  Today they just said no. Guess I need to find a new shoe store for my family.  I know they probably don't care about 1 customer not shopping there anymore.<//review>

<text>Great deals here. So many comfortable shoes to choose from. I went in to just grab a pair, now I'm not a person that has to have a lot of shoes, but after 2 hours of trying on a bunch of awwww so comfortable shoes I finally got down to 3 pairs I had to have at great prices too.<//text>< time>

First-timer. Great store and amazing selection of shoes. Wow! Better than I expected. They just need to do something to make it easier to find the right shoe/box you're looking for. They (boxes) all look alike and is confusing. They should put the shoe/design number on the display shoes so you easily know what box number to look for. But, we managed to figure it out. Wife and I got some great deals. It's the place to go for shoes as you can find ANY type you want. Much better than a sporting goods store.</text>

<Date>1564120094497< /Date><Rating>4</Rating><review>This place is good for family, if you intend to buy two pairs of shoe. The second pair you will get at  half price. They do have a very good selection, but if you only want to buy just one pair of shoe price can be better elsewhere but rarely. Sometimes the price is better buy at Amazon for the Skechers Go Walk 4 if you buy one pair. The second pair at half price will bring the price significantly.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

The customer service there needs some serious help. Lack of attentiveness. Lack of any emotion. More energy given to other employees versus actual customers. I won't be back.</Review>

This review has nothing to do with the quality of the merchandise or the efficiency and helpfulness of the staff. It is, however, the only store that’s part of the major corporation that does not have the hours of the store posted on the front window and that’s pretty pathetic.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I bought my 3rd pair of Sketchers from this location. On my last purchase. After wearing the shoes one time I notice what clearly was a defect in the stitching. So beings I don't wear this pair all the time. And having them for 60 days I took them back to the store I bought them from in Rancho Cordova. I show the young man that help me the problem. He says is it affecting your mobility. Firs off that's not what I brought them in for. I took very offensive to my age. And he ask me if I had my receipt I said no not after 60 days of having them and only wearing them one time. He says that there's nothing they can do. Well this will be my last time of buying there product. I will spend my Money on other shoe companies.< /Review>< Pictures>

We went with the bigger unit and it was perfect.  The project (of course) took longer than planned and having the doors on each side made it easy to still access everything we had in storage.  It was very fast and easy to schedule delivery and pickup.  I hope we don't need storage again soon, but when we do we will definitely use them again.<//Text>

Storage valet was fabulous. They were professional, always on time or a little early, helped make our storage experience painless. The truck driver deliver guys were the best. So kind. I would highly recommend them. Their office stall and the owner both made follow up calls to make sure all went well.</Text>

They delivered and picked up the POD from our home as scheduled and delivered it to our new house pretty quickly upon making a call. Payment was automatic each month so it was a “set it up and forget it” type of thing, which was great! We did have two large items damaged upon delivery to our new house but it’s the risk you take when using a mobile storage container like these (ironically it was the only two large items we had strapped down). Overall we would use Storage Valet again and would recommend to friends or family.< /Text>< Pics>

This was fantastic.  We packed the 16 foot container to the max.  Nothing was broken or damaged by this company. They dropped off the empty when promised. Picked up and storage the full container until I was ready for it to be redeliver.   I even changed the redelivery to the new home several times on short notice. And it was no problem for them.  Katie was awesome.  The driver was great.   I’d recommend this service and product.<//review>

Storage Valet was awesome. The 3 pods were delivered quickly when no one else could get me storage pods on short notice. I had the pods for about a month and a half. When I was done they picked them up within 48 hours. They were very fairly priced also. Would highly recommend them.< /Review>

We didn't have another house lined up so they stayed in storage. Six weeks later we moved into our new homes. The pods were delivered on time and nothing was damaged. It was a great experience. Each time I requested a delivery or pickup they were there when I needed them.< /text>< pics>

We used storage valet for our recent remodel. The unit was staged in our driveway and used for furniture and fixture storage during remodel. The unit was delivered as scheduled-the driver staged his truck to limit street interference for our neighbors- the unit was clean and in good / safe condition
. When finished the unit was picked up as scheduled, the driver was efficient and professional
Interaction with the administrative folks was painless and effective.<//Text>

It was a pleasure working with Storage Valet. They had been referred to me and I'm happy to recommend them to anyone needing storage. Our contacts were only on the phone and they were always friendly and courteous. They were dependable and reliable..... they were there with the pods or to pick them up when they said they'd be there. All of our belongings were just as we'd packed them in the pods.< /Review>

These people are incredibly nice and I would recommend them over the more recognizable brand name competition as they tend to be more flexible with their billing and storage options. For example, for our 33 day timeline, and the need for two storage units, we went with Storage Valet for $450 over PODS which would have been over $1000 and an automatic charge for a full second month of storage we didn't need.  Also, the storage containers we received were incredibly clean. The drivers showed up when they were scheduled and the communication with the company was direct and clear. I really appreciate these guys. Enough to take the time to write this, knowing I will likely not need their services again for quite some time.< /Text>

<Review>what a good job Storage Valet did for us. They had dropped the storage container off on time and picked it up on time. When we opened the container Not one thing was broken. The Driver was very nice and did a very good job. So I would say if you need to move Please call Storage Valet 1st and one more thing they had the best prices then their competitors.

Storage Valet offers a superior service.
I have booked with PODS and 800 Pack Rat in the past. This time I decided to try Storage Valet due to cost, availability and size of the containers. They offered a container larger than its competitors, in addition, there wasn’t an additional charge for long distance moving (compared to its competitors). Pods were dropped off and picked up on time and were practically brand new. Customer service was pretty responsive as well.

I recommend going through Storage Valet for your storage solution and needs.< /review>

Very easy to schedule drop off and pick up of their storage pods.  I used 2 of their smaller sized pods end to end so I could access both on one side of the driveway.  It was an essential piece of our garage remodel.  Great service and the driver took the time to show me how to open and close the pod door properly!< /Review>

Storage Valet made a very difficult cross country move much easier than I could have imagined.  I moved a family of 4 from NYC to LA for a fraction of the cost of regular movers and with  a lot more peace of mind.  The drivers on both end of the move were courteous, professional and efficient, and the customer service was great from beginning to end.  I would definitely use them again.</text>

<Review>Delivered for a month to our driveway, and promptly picked up when called. Safe and convenient way to store at home while work was done on our hardwood floors and we packed up all of our house. We would recommend them to others.

We have been customers of Alex now for almost 20 years and find him and his team flawless in the storage service they provide.

They are involved with their customers on a personal and individual basis (as may be needed).

They have worked with me on a number of situations as a partner. They supported me when they felt I was mistreated and assisted me several times beyond their normal call of duty.

Of course their rates are very competitive as well.<//Review>

Alex was great. Ordered pod on Friday, showed up on Saturday.  Picked up when I wanted as well.  Easy to use service.</Review>

Storage Valet were simply outstanding. I researched various companies including the more national/well-known companies but the reviews simply didn't compare. I was not disappointed. The company has smaller and thus cheaper pods to offer greater flexibility for customers. The drop off and pick up fees are the same regardless of the number of pods you choose, and the overall prices are very competitive.

Customer service was excellent - calls answered immediately every time and there was no problem in me shifting our arrangements during the service.

Our new home, where we wanted the pods dropped off, was out of their service area but they were able to extend a 'live unload' drop off service for us. The movers that we had hired to help unpack were a number of hours late and the Storage Valet associate patiently waited and was very courteous and kind.< /Text>

My family shopped around for the best rate and ended up renting with "Storage Valet."  Their prices were reasonable and their delivery and pick up times were very flexible.  This is one of those times you don't get what you pay for. These guys were top notch and their communication via telephone and email were awesome!  They fit a 20 foot container into a very small and tight place.  This company was very professional and know what they are doing. I recommend them to all my family and friends and will definitely use them again in the future.  A++++<//Text>

Thanks for the kind words and sharing your experience.'}</Resp><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I truly cannot say enough nice things about my experience with A Valet.  They are kind, cooperative, patient and less expensive than most companies.

My Mom ordered the "other" mobile unit and it arrived late, in bad condition, 4 feet shorter and a very dated unit.  She quickly filled it up and needed another unit.

We then ordered her a Storage Valet.  Katie was great on the phone and the unit showed up on time and was 20 ft in length, not 16 feet like the other *** Company.  David waswawesome too.  He delivered the Valet.  It was shiny, had two doors, anchors inside the unit, all metal and looked amazing compared to its neighbor.  As they were parked side by side you could clearly notice the difference.

I ordered another for myself and same great service.  We had several hiccups and delays and Storage Valet was so accommodating!

The other company took days to drop off and days to pick up.  We were promised a 3 hour window of time and they showed up 6 hours later than that!!  They weren't professional, accommodating or apologetic at all.

I would refer  Storage Valet in a heartbeat!  The way they drop off/pick up the unit is state of the art.  They require very little space to maneuver. Yet, another bonus.

Moving is no fun!  This roup makes it easier!  Try them!  You'll be glad you did!< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_id>

Storage Valet was one of the bright spots with my move.  Everyone from Alex, Katie, and all the drivers were friendly, responsive, on time, and made me feel like the customer.  Thanks for an amazing experience.

The folks at Storage Valet truly embrace a commitment to customer service. I am a repeat customer for a reason... no one can come close to providing such a pain free and comprehensive solution to moving/storage. I have been a customer of Pods and PackRat and Storage Valet blows them both out of the water in every category. It is extremely refreshing to work with such a wonderful group of people who are 100% committed to providing the best customer service possible. This crew has made my last five moves as painless as they could be. Don't bother calling anyone else. I can't thank you enough for the phenomenal services you offer. Thank you!</Review>

<text>Why review a storage company?  because their customer service was OUTSTANDING and my things were not only taken care of they were treated like items i care about.

From my original call into Storage Valet 18 months ago to move my parents stuff into storage when I took over their house to MY move, they not only took care of the items I cared about from my parents, they recently unpacked them for me, took photo's so I could remember what was in there and REPACKED them into a transport pod.  They also brought THAT pod to my house so I could pack more things into it and brought me another pod for my other things.  When they repacked my parents pod sent me the photo's so I could help reorganize.  THANK YOU FOR THAT EXTRA WORK!!

Pricing was great and they were easy to communicate with.  I would recommend them to anyone that cares of someone cares about their things.

They now are sending both Pods to my move location (Boise Idaho) and coordinated it all with that company.  Bravo Storage Valet, Job well done.<//text></record>

<Review>We rented a 16-foot trailer from pods. for $268 a month when we needed another we called around and found Storage Valet amazingly we paid $130 a month from Storage Valet for almost the same thing.
The Pods storage unit we've had to go pull some things out of.  When we opened it we found a disaster not from the packing but from the handling.
The Storage Valet units were pristine when we open them.  Now I asked you, who would you go with?

Shady credit card charges! I called to have them pick up empty units and was told it would be a couple days because they were busy. They charged me for all those days. Never sent me a receipt or invoice. I have called several times and have always been told someone would call me back to resolve it. I still have yet to receive a call back and it's been 3 months.<//review>

I has scheduled the crate to arrive from 1-3 and it showed up at 4:40, this caused me to not be able to finish packing that night. I sent an email with no reply and then called the company after a driver had showed up at my house. Talked to someone on the phone who was extremely rude. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE LATE THEY WOULDN'T EXTEND MY PICKUP TIME, AND ARE CHARGING ME AN EXTRA 50 DOLLARS. I tried to talk to someone else, but Alex said he was the only one in the office that day. So there were no other options but to talk to the man who was so rude to me. I've used this service before, but never again now.< /text>< Pics>

Love this place! We order delivery fairly often. I've only tried their boneless wings, they are super crispy and have a great sauce amount. You can't beat the price either. The curly fries are also amazing.< /Text>

Well this used to be my go-to place for wings when I could not make it to Buffalo wild wings, but now I guess I have no reason to go here it has gone kind of downhill. The wings are insanely tiny but the price is still a little up there for what you get..sad<//Text>

<Review>it was the super bowl and i orderd 35 price wings. they said my order would be dont at half time and already took 2 hours to get ready so that was already bad, but understandable. i get there then have a bunch of others also mad because they weren’t getting their orders. So i was asking where mine was and they said it was never taken. keep in mind i had to wait 30 min for them to tell me this. everything was disorganized and they have been going down hill ever since they got a new owner. don’t go here, just go to buffalo wild wings or wing stop<//Review>< Pics>

I ordered the 15 piece mild buffalo wing combo and they were dry. I was hoping for more saucey wings. They were crispy, I'll give them that. The mozzarella sticks are good. The jalapeño poppers have ricotta cheese, instead of cream cheese or even cheddar cheese, which appears to be a common cheese. The fries are thicker than McDonald's fries, but not quite steak fries or wedges. The sweet habanero chicken strip were more saucey than those wings. I'd give it another shot, honestly.<//Review>

Decent wings if I'm feeling super lazy to drive to wingstop. Nothing special about this place but nothing too bad either. I would never crave the wings from here the only reason I came was because I didn't feel like driving the extra couple of miles to wing stop. At least it was affordable....but I still wouldn't mind paying the extra $1.50 At wingstop because I would enjoy it more

Plenty of parking in the rear<//text>

I've passed this place on the corners of Oxnard and Vineland a thousand times and always wanted to stop. This day I did. The service was very friendly, the place was clean and I got the Parmesan garlic wings and the Cajun wings. Both were delicious. I wad impressed. I will go back and try done of the other flavors too.< /Review>

This was my go-to wing spot until my last visit. 8/10 wings were pinky sized or smaller. While the flavor was still good I was really disappointed and unfortunately won't be returning. They should spring the extra dollars and buy the jumbo wings from their supplier< /text>

Anyway, it was early in the day and I was the only person there. I'd ordered 20 wings well done, and that's all. The wings were not crispy, in fact they were soggy. I only had that one request. Then he added .75 to my total because I used a debit card. For a $15 transaction! No mention was made about this fee when I called. So if I spent $100 here I'd have to pay .75?

If I was rating the food, I'd give it 5 stars. But the service is horrible and you shouldn't even bother buying extra sauce, because your chances of getting it are slim to none. They constantly change the price on their boneless wing deal. It is displayed as 60cents per wing but its closer to 80cents. I dont care if it costs a little more, though I would want to know the price before I purchase it.<//Review>

The boneless wing were mostly bread and fried a little to long. The people were friendly but the food did take a while to come out. I would try the traditional wings if I could do it over, probably wont come back though.< /review>

My new wing spot in North Hollywood!  Free parking in the back.  I was blown away by this place. Not only was the food hot and fresh, it took less than eight minutes.  Granted all I ordered was a ten piece hot wing and curly fries, but I've waiting over 20 minutes before at other wing places in the area.  The night I went, they were also pretty busy with a lot of carry out orders.  The dinning area has a big screen TV in the dining area so I decided to stay and watch one of the football games that happen to be on.  If you want to get rowdy and drink while watching a game, I would still recommend Big Wangs, but that's the ONLY reason.  House of Wings is superior in every way from the food to the service.   The ranch they served with my wings was also amazing, according to the guy behind the counter, it's homemade, made fresh daily.<//review>

<Review>Big fan of wings...This place is not bad, but other places in the area top it. The wings are pretty small, but do come with plenty of carrots and celery. Their basic hot is the standard that most places use nothing original (I do like the classic flavor). The decor is simple, the location is easy to find, plenty of parking in the rear or on the street.< /Review></record>

<text>Ordered and paid online from their website . When I went to pick up my order it was missing one of the items listed in the "Combo Platter", and when confronted about the missing item the only person working there said "Not my fault, its not on the in store menu" then shifted the blame to the manager. When asked if they could substitute the item for something else they said no "Not my problem". Overall the staff was unprofessional and rude.
On another occasion I clearly order 10 wings yet they tried to charge me for 20. When confronted about this they blamed me and then the machine.
DO NOT EAT HERE. The food was mediocre at best and the mozzarella sticks were microwavable at best.<//text></record></dataset><record>

It's our go to spot when I do not feel like doing my own wings. The staff are professional and personable. Although I like my wings spicy my fiancee enjoys the variety offered on the menu.In my opinion House of Wings soars above 90% of it's competition.< /Review>

<Review>I used to love the wings here until they became lazy with their delivery and gave wings the size of my pinky. I ordered from their website told me it’d be an hour but instead took 2 and when I called to complain the guy was not only rude but made it seem as if it wasn’t an issue at all<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

So basically no chicken on the wings and the Jalapeno poppers were gross they were fried perfectly but the inside was nasty. And there was no Ice for the drinksThe only good part was the fries which were cooked perfectly crispy!!!

This place has excellent in house bleu cheese, and a great price for there combo. The wings well there on the small side but packed with big flavor. Time wise this is a good spot if youre looking for a quick fix. Wait time here is about 15 minutes. We went with the sweet habanero which seemed like a local favorite but it didnt bring the heat but the original hot got the fire going. The also gave a generous amount of sides as far as celery carrots and fries with the combo.<//review>

Very tasty and not expensive, but the place is a little worn out. Could use little remodeling, especially at the order stand. Also tables legs are different lengths, so the tables are not stable. The staff is nice and helpful.< /Review>

Ordered buffalo wings with extra sauce. What I got was dry unsauced plain wings. Not sure if it was on purpose but I'm dissapointed. Only good thing I can say is about grub hub delivering on time. I would not recommend this place.</Review>

I am sad to have to review negatively this restaurant. The wings are probably the best I’ve ever had. Unfortunately, the service is disgusting. The gentleman who attends the phone and I believe is the manager, is always annoyed and rude whenever I call to ask about the status of my order. There is always something missing: extra ranch (that I paid for), fries or drinks. The order is delivered super late and he always blames his driver as if he is not responsible for his staff. There is a $5 delivery fee and I have had to pick up my order countless times because of their incompetence. When they are confronted with their inability to provide customer service, they get defensive and blame each other. It’s very unfortunate because they truly do make great food.<//review>

The food was great about a year ago. But since then, every batch of wings I got was worse than the last. Too oily, too salty, not enough sauce, overdone, etc.

The last batch of drumettes we got was filled with bone fragments from poor cutting.

They offered me a free batch to make up for it, but I don't think it's even worth it.</review>

Worst service ever. After placing the order a person called me to say my card was declined. During the call i checked my bank account to see that they indeed charged me. It was for another customers order. Never said anything about it until I quested the charge. Repeated multiple times that it was credited back. I see no credit. Received no food. Received no sorry.</review>

We were very loyal customers and this time they sent out an order that was completely wrong. Only ranch dressing when we ordered honey mustard, bone-in wings when we ordered bone-out and the wrong chicken strips.

So, we called them and asked them to make it right. I was expecting some semblance of curtesy for being a loyal customer for year. I WAS WRONG! The woman, Lorraina, argued with me for 10 minutes that she read the order back 2 times and she did not. She had to read the CC # back two times because she couldn't type it in correctly.

Then after aggravating bickering - after I had a hard day. She offered to send out just the honey mustard sauce and I told her that was not acceptable because I didn't want cold reheated chicken strips - we all know they don't re-heat well and get soggy.

So, I told her I was a long time loyal customer and I needed them to make it right or I would write negative reviews.

She then said, " Fine, write your little email and we'll see what happens!" and hung up on me!

She should be fired, they should have sent out a new order and a good place would comp something as an apology. NOT argue with you for 10 minutes trying to justify their mistake. BTW, my husband and I were both in the room and privy to the conversation, so, we both hear the same thing and Lorraiana was just lying through her teeth.

Now, I was just screamed at by another employee</review>< time>

Then after aggravating bickering - after I had a hard day. She offered to send out just the honey mustard sauce and I told her that was not acceptable because I didn't want cold reheated chicken strips - we all know they don't re-heat well and get soggy.

So, I told her I was a long time loyal customer and I needed them to make it right or I would write negative reviews.

She then said, " Fine, write your little email and we'll see what happens!" and hung up on me!

She should be fired, they should have sent out a new order and a good place would comp something as an apology. NOT argue with you for 10 minutes trying to justify their mistake. BTW, my husband and I were both in the room and privy to the conversation, so, we both hear the same thing and Lorraiana was just lying through her teeth.

Now, I was just screamed at by another employee</review>

<text>[the Sign] ".49¢ boneless wings" Made an Awesome Tuesday Party...

[the Reality] Noteworthy were the sweet Habanero flavored wings...

[the Diner Sign] "#1 wings in NoHo" ->see the Heart of NoHo offering a $5 Happy Hour giving taste bud pallet of options.... shaming the minimum menu required order.

Once you've overlooked the "actual size" menu fine print & enjoyed the admirable Canvas Art you can definitely have a nice meal! Dine-in.<//text>< pictures>

Sean is Amazing! He always goes above and beyond. He sells you great tires for a fair price. My family and I have been  going to him. Don't know when he opened but I think since 1985. I know for sure it's been since the 90s. I was trying to think how many cards I've stuck under the counter.< /Review>

< review>
I really like the way the business is run and how the owner treats his employees. I brought my sports car in with an alignment issue and a total of 6 tires some were good some were not some on the original matching rims, some not ,one wasn't  even  the right size for my car . I left with 4  new tires 2 spares all on the right rims my car aligned and test driven and they even put my little blue valve stem thingys back on and it didn't take long.  I'm very happy with my tires and my car feels sporty again. My only complaint would be they didn't have any wifi !</review>

<Review>Went in for a slow tire leak due to a screw stick in my tread, got there 15 min before opening, had me out of there by 20 after. Friendly staff. They have and work on all kinds of tires, trailers, farm equipment..., first come first serve, they even have a mobile unit that'll come to you.</Review><Response>None</Response><time>1497884448699</time><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

My tire notification kept going off, so I stopped by and they checked my tires and corrected all the pressure. When I asked him how much I owe, he said nothing with a smile. I know where I will be going to get tires from now on! Where service makes a difference.</Text>

<review>I visited Andy with the intent of making my son's Mazda 3 sound a bit more aggressive. He completed the job quickly, cleanly and cost effectively. He was also a joy to chat with during the whole process. Would highly recommend for all of your exhaust related needs.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Listen up guys, if you need muffler related repairs take them here.

Andy is great at what he does and is CHEAP compared to other places while doing fast and efficient work. I wish I had found him earlier in life.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808e317d2c0a59af:0x48cec213546ef33a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Had my the mid pipes upgraded to 2.5" from 2.25" and resonator deleted and the exhaust became super loud and raspy. So I purchased some stainless resonators online and brought car back for install. I left in a hurry and did not double check fitment and when I got to work I found the exhaust tips to be not leveled and aligned properly. Called Andu the owner and told him about it, and was very friendly about fixing it. we agreed that I come back the next day but I found out from work that I will be too bust and wont make it. So I took the chance and drove back using my lunch break. Andy took my car in and fixed it with ease and quickly I was on my way back to work! Awesome friendly customer service and I would highly recommend his work any time.< /review>

<Time>1598560702565< /Time><text>After reading previous reviews, I knew I could trust this Muffler shop.  I upgraded the exhaust on my 2020 Mustang GT (only 3 months old) and need the H-pipe welded after I did the DYI install.  I called on a Tuesday and  the owner said call me back on Thursday morning, which I did.  He said come to the shop at 12 noon and he will weld the pipes for me.  When I arrived, the install bay and owner was waiting for me which was excellent.  The welding took all of 10 minutes!   I have used many muffler shops in the past with my previous mustangs, but this guy is  the BEST hands down!!< /text></record>

This guy does great work at good prices. Wanted to get my Muffler switched out for another with some tips he provided. It came out perfect and straight, and the tips he sold me were quality. On top of that he was very nice to chat with during the install. Very satisfied. Only downside is the parking area and driveway. It's very compact with cars double parking everywhere, really awful trying to get in and out.</text>

Started going there in 2010he did a Great job on the 2009 Challenger. Cut off the stock from cat back replaced with 2 magnaflow. Sounded Great then and still in good condition. Couple years later took a Ford Explorer beater some kid had put some kind of knock-off glasspack on had him cut ot off and slap on a flowmaster another fine job. This week brought him my truck project for a header back system duel flowmasterflow 44's . Now I have a lot of work to do before it will look like it sounds.  Worth every penny.< /Text>

<Text>This place is amazing. No doubt. Absolutely professional and very very kind towards customers. While he was doing my resonator delete for my MK6 GTI, we talked for a bit and honestly, very nice guy.
He gives good advice towards his customers, a friend of mine wanted to delete his resonator for his Scion but ended up deleting the mufflers because the guy told him so. My friend ended up being more happy than usual.
Also, very cheap price. Would absolutely go again if my resonator welded itself into place.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>Jun Park< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I was looking into upgrading my OEM exhaust because it didn't have that sporty sound note that I was looking for.  My local muffler shop who I've gone with in the past was asking for too much (x2) to have my aftermarket exhaust installed so I needed to look elsewhere.  A few weeks prior to deciding to upgrade to an aftermarket exhaust, I was having the vehicle smog-checked.  Luckily my smog test guy and friend for many years referred me to his friend Andy here at Classic Muffler Service Center.  I gave Andy a call and he scheduled some time the following Saturday to have my aftermarket exhaust installed.  I didn't have the convenience of driving a few miles away to my old shop, but the 20 minute drive down from my town to Andy's shop was well worth it.

Andy charged me 1/2 of what my old muffler shop wanted and the results are outstanding.  Not only was the new aftermarket exhaust installed perfectly but it was done in about 45 minutes.  During the entire time, Andy and I bonded and had a great conversation while he was installing my new exhaust system.  His shop is clean and well organized, but the entire business complex is filled with cars that are visiting other shops and/or ones that are in the queue to be worked on, so finding a parking spot can be a challenge.

Now back to the install, another customer was there to fill-in the conversation and the entire experience was a blast!  I mentioned to Andy that I had another person who was interested in buying my OEM exhaust and he was surprised that I didn't want to throw it away, so I asked him to cut the exhaust into 3 sections (some at the existing weld-points) and he did so per my request.  Good thing I was able to resell that OEM exhaust the same day, and the guy I sold it to had Andy install it in his ride.  So in return, I was able to bring Andy some more business.

Not only was I super-happy with the installation, including the price I paid and also the friendly conversation I had with Andy and the other customer, I left with a big grin on my face once I got back onto the main road, hit the accelerator and finally let the exhaust rip.  My car now has the sound I've been looking for thanks to Andy.

Since Andy's shop is so popular, I might add that I did have to wait for about 1hr since another customer had already had an earlier time slot before mine.  While I waited in my car, a few other customers came by for quick fixes and after Andy helped out one customer, he didn't take any payment, even after the customer insisted.  Andy just said, "Next time, don't worry about it!".  Andy is such a friendly guy, but he's also generous and understanding.  He's more concerned about his customers and providing them solutions rather than just taking their money.  I noticed that he does take-in everyone who visits his shop and that's probably the reason why he has so many great reviews.

If you're waiting for your turn, have patience and don't feel like others cut in front of you, because Andy doesn't forget that you're next in line.  I initially had that feeling while waiting for my turn, but I quickly realized that if Andy knows that if the customer needs a quick fix, he'll quickly help them out before sending them off on their merry way.  No reason at all that I should knock-off a star for that.  It's just the nature of his business.  Ultimately everyone gets serviced, just need to be patient.  Afterall, I did show-up there to his shop on a Saturday morning.<//Text>< user_id>

I contacted so many places for pricing. This place had the best customer service, pricing and quality of work is very prestigious. Other shops are ripping you off from your hard earned money! This place is very honest. I have owned many cars and have gotten my muffler work at orther places. I won’t go anywhere else . This is my hone for all my muffler and exhaust needs!

I went to this muffler shop as Google review rated this business one of the best in town. I had high hopes, thinking his high rating and his craftsmanship will speak for itself. Unfortunately, my expectation was shattered by the lack of quality and craftsmanship from a simple muffler delete. I had asked whether the old small piping should be replaced prior to the work began. I was told it was not necessary. Well, that didn't end well, as my quad tips were rattling against my car's diffuser.  Every time i would go over a small dip or a bump, I could hear the awful rubbing sound. To too it off, the labor charged did not reflect the workmanship that everyone had been praising. Therefore, I would not recommend this business to anyone who has a custom muffler job in mind.< /Text>

5 stars for this muffler shop. The service man greeted us quickly (as soon as he came out from under the car he was working on), got our car on the rack in just a few minutes, diagnosed the problem efficiently, showing us what the specific problem was, and got it fixed quicker than we could have imagined. Some shops con you into thinking you need to replace more than you really do. This shop is honest, does just what is needed, quickly and professionally. Best experience we could have hoped for!</text>

Usually fast and quality do not go together. In this case it does. Andy is fast and the quality of his work is awesome. He did a custom cat back exhaust on my WRX in less than an hour. All the welds were perfect no leaks anywhere. And the best part it was a 3rd of the price if I was to buy a bolt on kit.
I would recommend him to anyone also I wouldn’t hesitate too go back for future exhaust work.</Review>

He provided me with a time to bring my car in, for a catalytic converter replacement. I brought my car in at the agreed upon time and he had me out the door in less than 30 min.

Price I paid could not be beat. The Toyota dealer was quoting me 10X of what I paid Andy (Yes you read it right 10X) and all other shops were charging me $100 -$300 more than what I paid.

Quality is awesome. My check engine light is gone and I was able to pass smog with flying colours.

Thank you Google/Yelp reviewers for finding me Andy. Your reviews were spot on. More importantly, thank you Andy for the best car service I have ever got.</text>< date>

Andy is awesome and super quick.  Had everything he needed and great conversation as he did the job.  I swear...  He could do this in his sleep.  It's almost like a show to watch him work.  He is really actually having a good time.  Great prices and he will beat most other competitors price.< /Text>

<review>They have the fastest service that I've experienced ever. I drove in to have my mufflers fix and was accommodated right away. My mufflers were fixed in no time, didn't have to wait that long. They fix things right away with quality work and they don't overcharge you. Very affordable rates. Two thumbs up for Classic Muffler Services Center.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Gmap_id>

I had a hitch installed over a month ago and the muffler tips have been rattling against the hitch. So finally I looked up muffler shops near me and found Classic and it was rated the highest with great reviews. I called Andy first thing Saturday morning and asked him if it was something he could do and if he was busy already. He told me Saturday mornings are busy but to come that afternoon so he could take a look. So I did and he told me it was an easy fix and it would take 30 minutes.  He said he'd be done in an hour with the truck he was working on, so I grabbed lunch came and back and he was ready exactly when he said he would be. He cut the muffler pipes and welded them back in place angled about half and inch lower and was done in about 20 minutes. Problem fixed, no more annoying vibration along the whole exhaust system! Andy was great, very friendly, his time estimates were great, and I'll definitely recommend him to friends and will go back with any other future exhaust work I need done.<//text>

<text>Five Star Work! I took my 1995 Taurus for Catalytic Converter work. I had called around other shops and they were just way up on price. Fortunately I came across Classic Muffler Services Center and called for an estimate! and the price was just what I was looking for! My car had two bad Converters, one was Clogged and the other didn't have the honey cone looking thing that's supposed to be there, no wonder my car was running like crap, it didn't have power because of the back pressure. I honestly saved around $200-$300 dollars! I am extremely happy with the quality of the work! I highly recommend this shop!</text>< Pics>

<Text>Overall the best muffler place I have been to. I have a 2010 mustang and wanted to make it sound more agressive sounding so I talked to my good friend who knows a lot about cars and he suggested this place. The guy was very nice and installed the muffler very quick. Now my mustang sounds the way a mustang should. If you are looking for an afforadable place to make your car sound meaner and more aggressive, then this is the place to go in San Jose.</Text>< Pictures>

Andy is the man! Took in my Porsche 914 to have some work done to my muffler (patching rust spots). Was very prompt with his service and didn't over charge. I will be coming here in the future for custom exhaust work on a 914-8 build.</review>

My lady and I visited during the holidays, there was live entertainment and a toy drive for the less fortunate. All in all, respect and the spirit of love was present.👍<//Text><Response>None</Response><user_name>Rigo Aragon< /user_name><user>103286123528638797322< /user><gmapID>0x80dcb1f93de0ea13:0x95d7cd29e8f2967e</gmapID></record>

Seems as they dont want to sell. Went looking for a few items for my bike which they had in sock. But was tryin to talk me out of buying. I left without buying anything. He was a nice guy. Not a motivated seller. Parts I wanted he told me, oh those are expensive. I went to spend money knowing harley parts arent cheap. I guess ill spend my money else where. Would not recommend that place to my friends.< /text>

<Review>The 2 Stars is NOT because of the food. The pizza was yummy, I ordered the Maui Zaui with pepperoni instead of ham. Unfortunately the number of pepperoni was quite less then expected. Topping was a bit sparse. The worst part is ordering in person. They charge $5 higher then their website. So DO NOT order in person at  location.</Review>< rate>

<text>I like Round Table pizza more than any other brand I have ever tried. They are the most generous with toppings and all ingredients seem to be fresh. A large pizza would be a good meal for at least four people or more which makes it quite economical too. Excellent value!</text><Date>1568686120626< /Date>< gmapID>

The lunch buffet is good as always. The staff definitely keeps the place very clean, the food was coming out as soon as it was finished. It helps that the young lady who took my order today is hot too! She made my lunch time well worth it!<//review>

<Text>I've been here a few times over the years and I find this place to be one of the best buffets in a 25 mile radius (literally).  Prices are affordable and you can get a salad with you meal as well. Customer Service is great and the quality of the pizza is as good as ordering from Round Table. The buffet is available from 11:30 to 2 Pm and different kinds of pizza come out over time.<//Text><gmapID>0x808579326684cad5:0x859ed7ce518fe3c8< /gmapID>< name>

<Review>Went in for the lunch buffet and they didn't have any pizzas. They made a vegetarian pizza on request and that was all I had for an option.  It was pretty much dead except 2 other customers and was slow.  Wouldn't go back for the lunch buffet. The pizza they put out was rushed and dry.  Not satisfied with the quality at this location.</Review>< UserId.>

Excellent pizza, wings, salad, garlic bread sticks and restaurant very clean on the inside. The staff was friendly and attentive. We were very impressed with the food quality. Amazing! Ordered the XL 1/2 Gourmet Veggie, 1/2 Chicken Garlic Supreme. Best pizza in at least a 50 mile radius. Generous toppings and we asked for heavy garlic and they made it perfectly. We'll be returning soon. Highly recommend. This is the best Round Table location and we eat at many of them in mutiple areas.</Text>

To me it's overpriced. That's the only drawback to this. Every round table throughout the entire company is a little bit overpriced in my opinion. However the product and the wait staff at this particular location is very good</review>< pics>

<Text>I have been ordering from this pizza place for over twelve years and the delivery service has always been really BAD. It takes one to two hours just to get a pizza delivered and this is when I lived around the corner. Once you get the pizza delivered it is delicious, even though it is a bit over priced. Why don't they just inform customers they don't offer delivery service at this particular location, it is better then providing exceptionally BAD delivery service that makes customers never want to order pizza from this location again.< /Text>< pics>

Ive only had one bad experience here and that was last year. Since then, they've gotten new management and I am pleasantly surprised at the turn around in customee service. It's pizza Friday every week in our household, so i guess you can say I'm a regular lol. They're always super nice and helpful, and the food is always on point. Hot and fresh and delicious.
They were even nice enough to carry the pizza to my car when I had a 2 liter and a baby in hand.< /Text>

They put too much cheese on the pizzas in this peticular round table. The only thing you can taste is cheese. Would not reccommend this particular restaurant. The others in the area are fine however.< /review>

I get one little pizza for $30 for delivery. I made sure to add "do not disturb occupants, call when outside" The dumb delivery driver starts ringing the doorbell and knocking on the door! He made a 90 year old get out of bed to go see who was at the door. I said to call when your outside! do not disturb the occupants! can you guys read?< /Review>

Called the location at 9:15 on a Sunday said they didn't deliver to my location (1.2 miles away) according to their site so I drove and when I got there they had the front doors locked and would not let anyone in. Absolutely do not know how they make money when their employees lie on the phone and close earlier then their business hours say.<//review>

Ordered a pizza for delivery. Pizza showed up almost two hours later, their excuse was they only had one delivery person that night(a friday). Truly awful service and didn't even handle a bad situation with any effort to make it right, even after me calling the next day. I highly recommend not ordering pizza from this pizza joint.</Text>

HORRIBLE PIZZA!!!! Last night 12/19/2015 we called and they told us that they had a two hour wait for delivery....so we decided to pick up instead...thinking ok the pizza would be fresh and hot...WRONG!!! We waited 1 hour for our pizza...we ordered two....with wings a total of $64.64!!!!! Got the pizza in the car smelled good.....got home which was 5 minutes away....The Pizza Was Lukewarm!! And the skinny crust that we ordered wasn't skinny at all!!  WE WILL NEVER NEVER GO BACK TO THIS ROUND TABLE AGAIN!!! THIS PLACE HAS GIVEN ROUND TABLE PIZZA CHAIN A BAD REPUTATION.........DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS 'BUSINESS' IF THAT IS WHAT THEY CALL IT....HORRIBLE PIZZA HORRIBLE SERVICE< /text>

< Review>
Don't really recommend going here.
Pizza was too mediocre for the expensive price.
I thought I was eating a hot n ready!
Go to lanesplitter or Zachary's for a quality pizza.
Got a tummy ache afterwards as insult to injury.< /Review>

< Review>
I ordered pizza tonight from Albany Round Table for delivery. An hour and 15 minutes later I call them to find out where it is, they tell me my order has been cancelled because we live out of their delivery zone.

WHAT!?! We have beenordering delivery from this location for the past 5+ years!!! She says we live 9 miles away and therefore are not within their zone.

On their own bleeping website it says I am 2.1 miles from their location!!!

That is ok ALBANY Round Table I will no longer order from you 2-4 times a month, book soccer parties, birthday parties, or any kind of event at your location.</Review>

A few people here are welcoming and nice, one person is very rude. The bathroom reminded me of a frat house without pledges.</text>

<review>Customer service needs some improvement. Tried to order a pizza few days ago and they had run out of cheese.  Out of cheese?! Come on.  Maybe Mother's Day was unexpectedly busy but, a pizza place that runs out of cheese? Can you tell I like cheese on my pizza?  :)<//review>< time>

(Translated by Google) The pizza had a lot of fat. It doesn't taste good, not like in other places.
Just order for one person ... and I didn't like it ...

Great service. Fantastic organic coffee. They even make the decaf exceptional! Fresh pastry. Relaxed environment. Good prices on all items from lunch sandwiches (on their freshly baked bread) to while loaf or sliced to order bread varieties. Nice place to get some computer work done. Beats Starbucks down the road.<//Review>

Family owned...fresh breakfast and lunch meals as well as a gorgeous, delicious bakery. Casual, order at counter and wait for food to be brought to table. One of my favorite local, casual spots!</review>

<review>Quaint low key place where regulars go relax and catch up with each other. The menu has something for everyone. The waffles are light and fluffy and the coffee is fresh and grinded fresh for each order. I had the Americana coffee and it was the best.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Far, far beyond what the strip mall joint it first appears to be at a distance. This is a classy little upscale and at the same time homey cafe where I had some of the best restaurant food anywhere. Quite surprised and delighted. And the service was genteel and graceful. Am actually astonished.</text>< Pictures>

The staff at Livermore Optometry are polite, friendly, efficient and practice Covid safety precautions.  They are thorough with the examination of my eyes and questions concerning my eye health......  However, I do wish someone had given me an approximate waiting time.  I don't mind waiting due to our national health crisis, but just an approximate time frame would have been appreciated.
I would have no hesitation recommending them to friends and co-workers.< /text>

My son was seeing Dr. Melindez for a year and when I asked for a referral to see the ophthalmologist, she refused to make the referral. My son’s pediatrician made the referral. And after seeing the ophthalmologist, we found out our 4 year old son doesn’t need glasses and probably needs patching.  It’s awful when an optometrist lets her ego come on the way of patient care. We will not be coming back to see Dr. Melindez.<//Text>

Dr Mason spent extra time explaining my current eye issues, and expressed her concern
With a great bed side manor. She emailed further details after my appointment and replied quickly to my questions.  I had a great experience and would recommend Livermore optometry and specifically DrMason to anyone looking for their services..thx<//text>

< Review>
Bad experience and uncomfortable with Dr. Teresa Yim.  She is not a care professional, not friendly and not knowledgeable but rude. I strongly do not recommend her for first time visitor. I have to report her to vision plan for discrimination. My time was wasted by waiting for a long time. I left without complete eyes examination because I did not feel comfortable with Dr. Yim around my eyes and how she treated me differently and that I have to wait longer.< /Review>

My family and I have been patients here for over 10 years. We’ve seen several changes but one thing remains the same, their patient care is awesome. From the first time I worked with Dr. Yim I knew this place was “home”.  And for the last several years Christina has been a family favorite with  her skills and humor embracing you as soon as she makes eye contact. I strongly recommend you make this your “home” too.</review>

<review>I have gone to Livermore Optometry for years. I have been there for annual check ups and serious complications with my eyes. Always nice, friendly and professional. Dr. Melendez is the best. She has gone above and beyond for my eye. I believe all the doctors are caring and give their all. A little more expensive than some eye groups but well worth it. Definitely worth it.<//review>< pics>

Dr. Melandez is the best. She has excellent communication skills to assess needs. She is intuitive and can pick up on cues or questions the patient may be thinking. She is through, comprehensive and a true advocate of your needs. She is the best optometrist I have had on years. The staff are friendly, helpful and enhance the experience of going to have your eyes checked. When you leave you confident about your visit and vision care.<//text>

I have been going to this optometrist for 2 years now and I have been continually impressed by the knowledge, professionalism and friendliness of everyone in this office. They have a great selection of glasses to choose from, and they will readjust the glasses and replace nose pads for free if you buy from them! I am very happy with them, and I continue to come back even though I attend Sacramento State. It is worth it to come back on my breaks!<//text>

I had a contact lens stuck in my eye and the assistant removed it - but discovered that it was torn. She couldn't see any more pieces in my eye so assumed it was clear. However, during the day my eye reddened and felt very irritated, then oozed goop. Obviously something is still in my eye. I'll go back tomorrow to have it looked at again. --- Went back, had it looked at and treated and now all is fine.< /text>

Excellent hours to facilitate visits for busy people working out of the area.  They make minor repairs on site and  facilitate more complicated.  It's a bit of a drive for us to use this facility since we live in the next County, but the excellent service makes it worth it.</Text>

This is my first visit to this location, the doctor who checked me is very knowledgeable and they have new equipment. They have lot of people working however the employees are not warm and welcoming. They don’t engage their customers.<//Text>

<review>Agree with all the positive comments here both for the office and Dr. Kuntz. Simply one of my all time favorite doctors. Both extremely knowledgeable and personable.

And anytime I have issues with my glasses, I walk in on a Saturday and they take care of it on the spot.

Highly recommend them to anyone looking for an optometrist.< /review>< Rate>

< Review>
Everything about Livermore Optometry visits is good.  Ease of making an appointment. Professional, friendly and competent staff. Although I haven't done much shopping around their prices seem competitive.  However, they, and so many other medical offices (dentists, etc) now want to take up too much of my time answering "thank you" e mails and taking surveys.  I took the survey, but that wasn't enough.  I immediately got a 'please leave a remark' request even though I had ignored the request at the end of the survey.  So my ONLY complaint is too much soliciting of opinions.  If they had an opt out of the survey or comments, I would definitely take it.<//Review>

<text>When I went home with my new glasses, I noticed scratches on them. I was in a hurry and didn’t take the time to examine them. I called and someone immediately ordered new frames. I took them in a few weeks later and they were exchanged. The process was easy and I appreciate them taking care of the problem immediately.< /text><gmap_id>0x808fe7996c9ccb0f:0xc1287cf1279e2280<//gmap_id><Name>Mya Ngo</Name><time>1515626182868</time>< user_id>

My only recommendation would be if the office began to accept Care Credit for the out of pocket costs for glasses or contacts.  My glasses were ready in less than a week.  It is nice to know that I have access to adjustments.  The late office hours are very helpful also!</Text>< pics>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>I absolutely love Dr. Kunitz! I had an incident with my contact lens, while Dr. Kunitz had other  patients, she took the time to still see me. I appreciate that type of service. The whole office was helpful and we all had a good laugh about my situation.

During our yearly visits, Dr. Kunitz is wonderful with my boys, she has a great sense of humor and gets being a patent. We always enjoy our visits.

Thank Livermore Optometry for all your help and wonderful customer service.</review>< Date>

<Review>Livermore Optometry Group has kept all 4 pairs of eyes in our family healthy for over several decades. We are pleased with the optometrists, the technicians, the staff, as well as all the services offered in one location, such as having our glasses cleaned, etc. Thank all of you for continuing to give excellent quality eye service in Livermore.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I've been a patient of Dr. Yim since I got my first pair of glasses in highschool. She is direct and to the point, thorough and rigorous in her diagnosis, and always very kind and caring. The rest of the staff are always friendly and very competent. I feel I can ask any questions I need to and that my needs are met in a direct and honest manner. I have never been wrongly or overcharged here. The nurse is always careful to explain that the extra test is not covered by my insurance and that it is my choice whether or not to do it (I do, it's a useful test!). All in all, I wouldn't go anywhere else.< /text>

I have been going to Livermore Optometry for 30+ years after nearly going blind in one eye at the age of 2 and they found the issue and corrected my eyes back to 20/20 over time.  I have been seeing Dr. Kuntz since she took over for Dr. Emrich.  We took my 14 month old daughter in for the first time and it was a great experience.  Dr. Kuntz is amazing with people of all ages!  So gentle and kind and always so thorough!  Wouldn't dream of seeing anyone else!</Text>

<Review>Both my husband and I have been going to Livermore Optometry for years.  Initially, we saw Dr. Ronald Emerich, and now see his daughter, Dr. Shawna Kuntz.  Dr. Kuntz is amazing.  She is thorough, knowledgeable and professional, while being very personable.  We have never had a bad experience at Livermore Optometry.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>5</rating>< response>

New shades len's kept falling out.  They replaced at no cost.  The negative was that the lady next to me was experiencing the same problem, so this appears to be a common problem with their send out contracted service.<//review>

Dr. Abramson is the best, helped solve my seemingly never-ending ongoing red-eye issues! He will prescribe a better eye-care regimen and follow up to make sure it's working. It is NOT normal to have red eyes when you are doing ALL that you can to keep them clear. Other docs have told me there's nothing they can do to help me. Although I suffer from seasonal allergies, my eyes have never felt this much relief for longer periods until Dr. Abramson helped me to see another alternative eye-care regimen. I'm surprised that other optometrists have NOT spoken up and been candid to tell me that they can cure my eye condition --they have all simply sent me away with no better advice nor alternatives and just dismissing me with mediocre service and misleading information. Happy to be on the road to recovered! :)<//text>
