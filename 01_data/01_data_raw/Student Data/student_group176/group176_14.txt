What a beautiful place! My husband and I went to the May Day Market they had today. It was amazing. So many vendors with beautiful pieces of art to sell. There were items made of many different kinds of materials like resin, there was lots and lots of resin, wood, metal, etc. A peaceful atmosphere and lots of lovely nature.</text>

Beautiful location. Took my mom for her birthday lunch. The staff were very nice and helpful. Beautiful gift shop that smells like lavender when you walk in. The farm is picturesque. Food was amazing. My mom fell in love with the place. Will be coming back for sure.< /Review>

Such delightful staff at a gorgeous venue! We attended their springtime market as a vendor and fell in love with the scenery surrounding us. We will be considering Pageo for future special events.</text>

<Review>A true jewel in the Turlock area! So glad that we found this spot for our daughter's wedding. A perfect combination of lovely garden grounds, Lavender farm and vintage charm, with original,  rustic buildings, dating back to when this was a  private homestead and working farm. The Bridal Cottage was once a hen house, which has been lovingly transformed into an accommodating, soft and pretty, vintage room where bridesmaids and bride can get ready while enjoying mimosas!

The Pageo staff was very accommodating and very easy to work with. Our daughter's Rustic-Vintage wedding was s dream, with vintage rentals provided by American Vintage Rentals...just look at the photos!</Review>< userid>

I got married on July 21, 2018 at Pageo Lavender Farm in Turlock. After my husband and I got engaged, I started looking at outdoor garden and forest style venues in Northern California. After compiling a long list of options, I started prioritizing my favorites and emailing them for more information and options to come tour in person. Pageo was the second venue we toured in April 2017 and we fell in love with not just the scenery of the grounds, but the customer service we experienced. The next day we learned that a Saturday in July 2018 had become available and without a second thought about any other venue we had on our list, we signed the contract.

Holly was our primary point-of-contact throughout the period we were wedding planning. She was so friendly and responsive, never showing any impatience or frustration with the dozens of questions I probably emailed her about throughout that time. Whenever we came to visit the venue to work out more logistics, Josh always greeted us and got to know what we were envisioning for the day. Whenever we asked about how certain things could be done, there was never a “No, we can’t do that,” but always a “Let us see how we can make that happen for you.”

About a month before, we were paired with our day-of coordinator, Jaimee Hinman. During our walkthrough we met with Jaimee in person and she was very well organized and knowledgeable about the wedding planning process, and gave us a few last minute suggestions around some planning items we were still handling. On our wedding day, everything went smoothly and I am so happy with how everything turned out! Our guests were blown away by the venue and service.

After planning my own wedding, I can say that I probably doubted almost every decision at some point in the process. But the one decision I never doubted for a second was booking Pageo Lavender Farm as our wedding venue. I cannot say enough good things out this place and these people!</text>

Nice place for a wedding. Weather permitting. It is in the middle of nowhere and the surroundings aren’t very romantic. But once inside that all changes.</Text>

My friend had her wedding reception here and it was private,  intimate,  and romantic. You can smell the lavender in the air as it set us all in the mood for love on this wonderful night.  No other groups were there so we got the place to ourselves. The food was delicious, the venue provided an open bar,  it had a dance floor and the bathroom was close by. There was also lavender soap and lotion in the bathroom which was a plus. It was a beautiful wedding, one that I'll always remember.< /text>

This place is such a hidden Gem! My husband and I were married here nov.2018 and I can’t stop raving about the service and location. ALL of the staff is Amazong the owner to so helpful and kind! They are truest full service!! We had just under 200 guest and everything went so smoothly. I even have a friend who has already booked her 2019 wedding here. Our guest were so amazed at how beautiful and calming Pageo is. I cannot thank the staff enough for being so great!<//Text>

Beautiful setting: went for a wedding and it was a beautiful day...started at 4pm, 200 people accommodated with plenty of room, food was great and plentiful, friendly staff, a young violinist that played and walked throughout the venue while appetizers were served outdoors. ..small camper trailer converted to coffee shop that prepared unique lattes, cold brew and hot coffee...lavender all around with hint in air...</review>

Had our wedding here first of September. People we worked with at Pageo were marvelous, our "day-of coordinator" Katie was attentive to detail, warm, and reassuring. Ended up being a 100 degree day and they helped us mitigate with a couple of swamp coolers and such. Evening of was beyond lovely when it all came together with everyone dancing under the string lights. ❤️</Text>

<Review>We just got married at Pageo (9/28/19!) The venue was absolutely perfect. Its was beautiful in the day time and at night! The string lights in literally every tree were stunning at night. The bridal sweet was massive. Plenty of space with good lighting to help the bridal party get ready. One concern we had with an outdoor venue was the uncertainty with the weather... But Pageo recently built a beautiful barn that they offered at no extra cost due to bad weather. That really eased our mind in case it rained on our day.

There was consistent communication with the venue months before and leading up to the wedding day to make sure all details were accounted for. Josh, Katie, Ana and the rest of the staff went above and beyond for us... from helping us find a DJ that fit our style to accommodating our last minute seating chart changes. Also, their vendor list is top notch. The catering, DJ, photographer were all from Pageo's vendor list and we could not have been more pleased with the quality of vendors they have.

They day of coordinator, Katie, provided by Pageo is amazing. Katie helped build and perfect our timeline for the wedding day. She was there early the day of to help coordinate with our vendors and make sure things were delivered and set up to our liking. She helped make our vision for the day come true!

Pageo also did not have any service fees or gratuity fees that a lot of venues in this area carry.

I would highly recommend Pageo!<//Review>< time>

<review>My wife and I had the pleasure of getting married here in November 2018. We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue. They were very accommodating to all of our requests, and went above and beyond to make sure our day went as perfectly as possible. We could not be happier with this venue and the staff that make it all function as efficiently as it does. I will 10/10 recommend Pageo Lavender Farms to anyone and everyone in search of a perfect wedding venue!</review>< pictures>

From our first tour and picnic lunch on the grounds to our big day, our experience with Pageo as our ceremony and reception venue was top-notch all around. Alexandria and the owners Patty and George were professional, communicative, detail-oriented, and kind. The care that they take in the business and the satisfaction of their clients is evident.

The venue itself is stunning and immaculate and perfect for a couple who values details and is looking for something more special than a banquet hall. Patty has conceptualized every inch of the property to make the space shine and has collected amazing antique items that just feel like they belong there without overdoing anything. It is not the "shabby chic" that tries too hard or a country style that not everyone can appreciate: it is pure sophistication with great pieces from the past. The many lights in the trees at night under the stars added so much to the atmosphere and were a better-than-expected surprise on our wedding day, which was the first time we had seen the venue at night.

George and Alexandria seem to keep the place running without a hitch and they were a pleasure to interface with intermittently throughout the year leading up to our wedding. George went above and beyond in helping to hang a chandelier for us and arranging our ceremony seats in an uncommon way to accommodate our unique processional for two brides. Alexandria addressed a couple of potentially problematic situations with professionalism and grace. At one point Alexandria came up to me to let me know that one of our guests was asking to purchase something from the gift store where our buffet had been set up and wanted to ask how I wanted to proceed. I was perfectly okay with it of course, but I thought it was so sweet of Alexandria to ask my permission for something that could potentially detract from the reason everyone was there and I respected her for thinking of that.

I could almost swear that George, Patty and Alexandria also made the weather better and brought some welcomed clouds and the breeze on what the forecast said would be scorcher of a day; our experience with Pageo was that great.< /review>

This is a beautiful venue for any celebration. We were there for a cousins wedding and reception. The outdoor space is shaded and they had lots of umbrellas around the tables. I have to say that I very much enjoyed the location and would recommend it to others.</Review>

I love love love this place. I came here once for an intimate baby shower luncheon and a second time for a photography session. Both times the staff has been nothing but accommodating making every effort to assure I had whatever I needed. The day of the luncheon we sampled a couple salads and sandwiches from their menu and let me tell you- the food was fantabulous and that lavender iced tea?!?! Ah. May. ZING.< /Text>

The atmosphere was amazing. The whole lights and the trees oh it was beautiful. Perfect setting for a rustic but elegant wedding. Highly recommend this venue for a wedding. The food was really good.< /text>

I got married here. During the daytime the grounds show off how well they are maintained. The staff is friendly and helpful throughout the planning process.

At night... Spectacular! The lights on the trees and overhead make the place sparkle and glow with just the right amount of light.< /Text>

Although I have never had the opportunity (yet) to visit their lavender farm, I did find them selling their wares at the Turlock fair grounds. I love all things lavender and jasmine so I gave one of their testers a whirl. I ending up purchasing the lavender/jasmine lotion. A superb duo! I plan on heading back there next weekend for the spray. I love the lovely dark amber glass bottles their products are packaged in.  I do wish the owner would consider not putting dangerous parabens into the ingredient though. It is a lovely product and taking the parabens out would keep the product more 'natural'. I keep mine on the door in the refrigerator as it seems to make the product last longer. A tip I learned from another lavender farmer.<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I was told by a friend (who is highly reactive to anything gluten or even cross contamination) that Susie Cakes wheat free and flourless products are not only tolerable and agreeable to her system but also (and most importantly ) so Very tasty and scrumptious. In a world of delicious bakeries mostly taboo to those gluten free among us, Susies is truly a lifesaver. I wandered into one in Studio City (they're located all over southern and northern cal and recently expanded to Texas), and was so pleasantly surprised indeed to find a colorful palette of cakes cupcakes and cookies (oh my!) just in time for the pastel oriented Mother's Day holiday and the colorful cinco de Mayo . Samples were given to me of the lemon coconut cake (so light and fluffy) and the gluten free peanut butter cookie ( homemade and wholesome!) not to mention , the sweet, inviting staff who work  behind the counter and are as sweet as the confections they serve up.  Susies cakes is a delight to the eye, to the sweet tooth and to one's mood. Pick up a cake of choice today !< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ6TgZ0DDBrNIMpmeXxM-A52ZWJvyRQ9ltfWVZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKrOcqjX_owoCHKQQE3FCv5Rbui4glxAN2vVKl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKINnkG95yyer2O-LTrU1mTsR-Anp5MN4b2v3k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcDbER_KLYYJjMOK7GmhCh-fZOKTpORvBTV_i9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOdKVCE7XlsH1QmReja7SxjLuOD6HfBfA6q2hD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmT_GvjXGVi8dXMzhX_k-Qjw9IfkB8sArnubjg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHFISCXWFUPQNe8dVlflfbcYoaXvFZy_Mvx8-e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

Carrot cake is so well done, among the best I’ve ever tasted. Just the right amount of fresh carrot flakes, nuts, and the “golden” raisins are a perfect recipe mod. The seasoning, the oil, the frosting are all fresh and perfect.

Same for the Tropical Coconut cake, my other favorite. If you like piña colada, this is the cake to get, since the inner frosting contains crushed pineapple pieces.  So well done, moist and delicious.<//review>

<text>My husband's cake order was good, the custom cake looked nice, however, the flavor of the cake is what I didn't like. The thickness of the frosting was also not tasty, it was hard and too sweet.
I would have loved the cake to be more moist and flavorful. Other than that i rate them 3 starts. Thank you!

I ordered a cake for my girlfriends birthday that was incredible. Not only was the cake gorgeous to look at, it was so damn tasty. Everyone loved it. The customer service was great, the text on the cake was gorgeously written and the order was ready for pick up when it was supposed to be. Perfect</Text>

Ordered a birthday cake for my fathers 90th birthday.  It was delicious and we were all impressed with the flavor and moistness of the cake.  Actually,  had a cupcake from there today that was delicious too!<//Text>

< review>
Mara was awesome! I wanted a little guidance on selecting a cake & she gave me just the details I needed to make my experience  quick, like I needed, and shockingly....FUN! I got the retro blue round vanilla confetti cake. Instead of the displayed red writing, I wanted hot pink & a particular font as part of a joke for the receiver of the cake. I showed her and she matched it like she created the font! Lol. I told her I'd be happy with something similar to the font, but she exceeded my expectations. She also helped me with candles and made sure to instruct me on how to care for and carry the cake(it was heavyyyyy). Everyone in the store was great! Hats off to the owner as it seems you've created a work environment where your staff are happy, support one another, & customer experience is a priority. I'll be back a lot for graduation season. Thanks again!< /review>

Holy smokes!! I get what all the hype is about. The vanilla mini cupcakes make it hard to not just pop one after the other in your mouth. Deslicous buttery cream frosting. I purchased other sweet treats but enjoyed the cupcake so much I had to send over a review< /review>

< Review>
The staff were nice. Good luck finding parking around that area. Extremely disappointed at the cakes. Looked great but taseted awful. Because of all these 5 starts reviews, we chose to get the cakes (smash cake and b day cake) for our one year old. Tasted like pure sugar and the cake was not even moist.. None of our guests liked the either of cakes. Both cakes went staright to trashcan. The only good memory was the pictures of the cakes. Not sure why is so busy there but for sure we won't go back.</Review>

<Review>I tried the carrot cake and the coconut lemon cake.  Since I don't like rasins,  carrot cake was not as pleasing as I would have liked it,  but the coconut lemon was amazing.  The staff was very friendly and made nice recommendations.  I wish they offered coffee.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Great for a small shop! Good but small selection of hand picked retail releases at prices you'd expect. The staff picks are fun to look through and are interesting and eclectic. They are often playing some really interesting tunes as you browse. The staff is friendly and helpful, but I can't help but pick up a bit of that pretentious hipster vibe on occasion.

Used releases are in good condition but priced on the high side of collector value. You won't make a profit by buying and flipping from here, but it's a good place to find that first pressing you've been looking for at a reasonable market price.

Used vinyl in the dollar bins underneath has no organization, so be prepared to dig. Here is where you might find some gems. It won't be incredibly rare or valuable, but some of my favorite tracks have been found here and they're in relatively good condition.

My only complaint is that the reggae selection is seriously lacking, but that seems to be the case for both of the main vinyl sources in downtown Santa Cruz. I'm not sure why that is... I know it's a popular genre in the area.</Text>

This is my favorite record store. The staff is very knowledgeable and in no way pushy or in your face. The layout is simple yet expansive. There's an excellent selection of pristine new records, and a massive array of used records. The back wall holds the dollar bin, which in my eyes is the store's greatest asset. They get donations all the time from DJs and collectors, and don't have the time or man power to sort through and price each record. It's more cost efficient for them to just put it all on sale. Thus, you can find some truly exceptional stuff for a dollar. I've bought records of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Freddy Hubbard, Guru, Company Flow, Talking Heads, Elvis Presley -- a wide array of true classics from every genre, some in near mint condition still in shrink wrap, for $1. You should shop here if you like music.<//review>

Nice selection of records, mostly used, So selection varies. Also has used gear, with a phono playback in mind, plus new gear for your turntable needs, The owner is the best one to talk with for gear, Paul is very easy going and helpful. well worth a visit, once you get past the small size your find a good local low pressure store.</Review>

Like most record shops these days they are dominated by newly pressed vinyl but their used selection is pretty good considering the size of the place. I found 4 used records and paid just over $10. New vinyl is the same price you'd pay almost anywhere.
I visited on a Monday so it was easy to find metered parking.
I would prefer a bit more organization of the bargain bins. They are somewhat alphabetical but everything is so mixed up that you have to search each bin to maybe find what you're looking for.
I definitely recommend a stop at Metavinyl if you're in Santa Cruz.< /text><user_id>114570600171967692607</user_id><response>None< /response>< pics>

Its easy to see that this record store continues to grow and improve.  The have a clear vision of what they want to be and tend to keep it simple.  And good.  Crate digging here is a happy experience because the inventory is not stale and overpriced, and there are no loser employees blaring unbearable screamo. My preference is used vinyl, and there's usually a ridiculous amount or good records in the dollar bin.  So far -so good.  Two thumbs enthusiastically up.</text>

It's too bad that a negative review appears at the top of the search page for Metavinyl. I found the staff to be very professional and true enthusiasts. Paul, the owner, was especially helpful tracking down and fixing problems with our daughter's "starter" turntable.

They know their stuff—both hardware and software. Great place for lovers of vinyl!< /text>

I am new to town, and while spending the afternoon touring beautiful downtown Santa Cruz, I found Metavinyl.
For new and used Vinyl lovers, it's an instant Gem. No pressure from the staff. They even have all the necassary equipment to purchase if you're just getting started. Plenty of new and used vinyl options. And, anything they don't have, you can just send an email, and they'll try and hunt it down for you, and let you know what they found. Incredible!!!
Thank you Metavinyl, from your new Fan Eli 😊< /Review>

A really great selection of used records, but not a lot of "deals" to be found.  Prices are fair and in line with what you'd pay online at Discogs, but you aren't going to find raging deals.  You will find some pretty rare stuff, though.  An absolutely worthwhile shop that carries only records and stuff you'd use to play them. (Actually, they may have a couple of dozen cassette tapes, too).

Their new selection is large for a small shop, but not extensive.  I mainly shop the used bins.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Beverly Hills braces has the most amazing staff and of course orthodontist. We always feel so taken care of. Dr. Malayem is very caring and knows his job really well. He truly cares for his patients and is not driven by money like many other doctors out there. We have trust in him 💯 %! Both Haleh and Rose are awesome too and so is the back office staff.< /Review><user_name>Moj Kang< /user_name><rate>5</rate><Date>1615233903521<//Date><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

The Dr and staff are very nice. My visits always go smoothly and prompt.  They have been taking extra safety precautions during covid which shows their care and commitment to their customers and staff.  Pro tip -- there is a two hour public parking garage on Bedford which is free for two hours.< /text>

<user>103696989290224480765<//user><Text>It took a lot of trial and error to find the right orthodontost. 3 top doctors said that my son needed to have surgery to take out on his front teeth. For Dr. Molayem, that was not necessary. With his talent, he fixed my son's smile without surgery. When we found Dr. Molayem, just by meeting the man and his amazing staff We knew he was the right choice.  We started going to Dr. Molayem in February of 2017. My son's teeth were in the worst shape possible. Ever since then we have received nothing but warm, accomdating, family-like treatment from Dr. Molayem and his staff. It's now been nearly 3 years. My son has finished his treatment with his braces, and thanks to Dr. Molayem And his staff's attention to detail, pride in their work, and precision, my son's smile is absolutely perfect. To anyone looking for a top notch orthodontist, Dr. Molayem is the full package.<//Text><rating>5</rating><pics>None</pics></record>

<Text>Dr. Sid Molayem is the sweetest. He truly cares about his patients and wants them to have a great experience. He provides excellent results. During my Invisalign treatment, he showed me the 14-16 messages it took to get the right fit for my teeth.  If that doesn't show you dedication to craft then I really can't help you. His staff are always friendly, kind, and helpful. They are the only people I am willing to drive on the 405 to Santa Monica Blvd for at 3:00pm in the afternoon. Great experience.<//Text>< Pics>

I am not usually one to write a review, but this one is truly necessary. Dr. Molayem is absolutely wonderful. I am so pleased with my experience with him and his team. I was particularly nervous about getting braces and Invisalign as an adult and consulted with many orthodontists but none of them seemed like the right fit until I met Dr. Molayem. Everything in his office is done with excellence and an attention to detail that you just cannot find elsewhere! I am now glad I waited to get orthodontic treatment until I found Dr. Molayem. He goes out of his way for his patients (even mailed me rubber bands when I had run out during this pandemic), and always prioritizes results. Additionally, his front office staff is responsive, friendly, and professional. They are particularly flexible every time I have asked to change my appointment. I cannot possibly rave enough about how happy I am with my teeth! All thanks to Dr. Molayem and his team!</Text>

I had originally gotten my braces elsewhere and went into Dr. Molayems office for a consultation to realize that the braces I had put on were a huge scam. They accommodated me and worked with me on pricing and welcomed me in with a very loving and kind staff. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a perfect smile and an amazing experience.< /review>

He saved me! I had an unfortunate experience with Invisalign that wrecked my teeth/bite. Other orthodontists said it would take time with braces to fix it. He was the only one who was honest and said it could be fixed with Invisalign in a short period of time. He went beyond what I thought he could repair. My teeth and bite are perfect and I loved every moment in this office. He and whole staff are so polite and professional. 10 our of 5 stars!!</review>

Dr. Molayem is by far the best Orthodontist. Very professional, experienced, kind, gentle, caring and honest. He Treated both me and my daughter and we’ll be forever grateful. If you are in search for a good reliable orthodontist, he is the one. No question.
His office staff are a complete reflection of Dr. Molayem, always kind and welcoming.

< Review>
Dr. Molayem and his team at Beverly Hills Braces are incredible! My teeth had shifted quite a bit after 10+ years of not wearing my retainer following having braces as a teenager. I reached out to Beverly Hills Braces hoping to straighten my front teeth...however not only did they successfully straighten my teeth using Invisalign, but they also corrected my under bite without the need for surgery. This was something I was told was impossible by orthodontists in the past, so its pretty amazing results. I absolutely love my smile now and visiting their office monthly over the past year has been wonderful. I recently got married and every time I look at our wedding photos seeing my perfect smile makes me so happy! Thank you Beverly Hills Braces and I recommend anyone looking for an excellent orthodontist who really will go the extra steps to ensure you are happy with your results to please go visit them!<//Review>

< review>
After a horrible first couple of experiences trying to find an orthodontist, I was worried I wouldn't find one in the Los Angeles area that truly cared about their patients and came at a reasonable price as orthodontics for me is entirely out of pocket. I actually found Dr. Molayem on Yelp and made my first appointment right away. Nearly a year later, I couldn't be more pleased with the level of professionalism Dr. Molayem and his entire staff have showed me. Getting braces as an adult isn't fun, but this entire team makes it an enjoyable process and going to my appointments feels like I'm catching up with friends. Carmen is amazing, always has me laughing, and Christina always has a smile on her face, too. You can tell the staff really enjoy working here and it makes the whole experience that much better. Haleh and Rose at the front have been coordinating all of my appointments, are always such a joy, and keep everything running on time and couldn't be better. Recently Haleh went above and beyond in helping to match me to a potential oral surgeon for my jaw surgery after a particularly rough morning. Another frustrating process over the course of the past year made easier by a caring team.

If you are any age with any braces concerns, please don't look any further - you will be in good hands. I have a fairly difficult case and not once have I questioned that I'm receiving the best possible treatment plan for my teeth and jaws.

Bonus!! Dr. Molayem shares the office with his daughter who happens to be an AMAZING dentist - Dr. Nina (Polished Dental).<//review>

Dr. Molayem has provided orthodonture for my wife, both my kids and several of our friends. He is extremely professional, has a great staff and provides excellent care. You won’t find anyone better!< /Review>

Dr. Molayem and his team are spectacular. I just finished Invisalign treatment with them and my teeth are perfect!!
Dr. Molayem is the nicest, loveliest person and is incredibly good at what he does. He is a perfectionist and wouldn’t rest until my teeth were absolutely perfect.
My 10-year-old son started going to the office 2 years ago and we have seen incredible results with his teeth and jaw alignment.
Everyone in the office is wonderful and feel like family! They have done so much for me, my smile and my family and I am so thrilled that I was referred to them.
I can’t recommend this office highly enough!< /Review>

Both my daughters  are Dr Molayem's  patients.  We've been very happy with the results thus far! Dr. Molayem is very knowledgable and nice, and he has the nicest and most helpful staff around.  I would highly recommend Dr. Molayem to anyone searching for an orthodontist!< /Text>

<rate>3</rate><Text>Amway has wonderful products. However the store doesn't carry everything that I needed. And you can only get 3 of each item.
I can see where it would be convenient but before you go you should call to see if they have what you need. Your better off just making an order and going to the warehouse. However its cheaper to just get it sent to your house. And that doesn't even include the gas.</Text>< Pics>

Best Barbershop in Fresno. Vince has been my Barber for a year now. Vince and his crew do great work. They care about how you look and take the time to get it right. My haircut looks really clean after seeing Vince. Go and book an appointment immediately you won't be disappointed!!< /Review>

<review>I originally had a bad experience at this location turned out to be a misunderstanding with scheduling. The owner was super kind and respectful and turned everything around. Again my experience was due to scheduling as far as the atmosphere of the shop and talon of The barbers it's best in town hands down. Even sitting in my chair watching other guys get cut everyone walked out with a fresh cut and no complaints. These guys try for service and really do an excellent job prices are very fair and compared to every other place in Fresno. By far as talent and atmosphere this place gets 10 Stars. Thank you so much for the service will definitely be doing repeat business and referring.

<Review>First time going there and had a great experience with John my barber. Couldn't have asked for a better hair cut.  Totally surpassed my expectations. Best hair cut I have ever gotten and not just saying that. He is truly a professional at his craft.  I don't know what other place does this but they hook you up with a cold beer or other beverage while they fix you up.  Genius idea.  The place is very modern and super clean. It smells great as soon as you walk in the door...fresh and clean.  Thank you, John for the awesome haircut and friendly service. You're the man.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

You have a rugged/rustic look on the left side and a modern feel on the right. They also sale hair products, Jordan's, shirts, hats and alcohol!

I recently moved to the area and was looking for a Babershop for my son.
I found this place online and I really like . Tony does a amazing job and very kid friendly.

Make sure to make a appointment. It gets packed up.< /Review>

Went with my coworker. His fade looked good but we spent 2 hours there between waiting and getting his hair cut. It was a Friday at about 2 PM. They play all drake style music.  Corona light bottles for sale. Good location with lots of restaurants and a vape store next door.</review>

<Text>The haircuts were great, it's the pricing that threw me off. I called to make an appointment for our first time coming here with my 2 sons. John set me up with an appointment for 3 when I called at noon and I was grateful to get both kids in at that time. He told me over the phone it would be 20 each. That was ok with me. I got there and the board said 15 each for kids. They got simple fades, but still I figured he got us in last minute and the 20 each was still ok with me. When I went to pay I pulled out a 50 (I intended to give him the full 50 to include tips for both boys) but when he saw the 50 he told me "ok that will be a total of 50". I still gave him the 50 like I had intended to but sadly this will be my last time going to this location. Be honest with the customers and you could have a life long customer.<//Text>< pics>

My hair is uneven.
The service was marginal at best.
My hair is uneven and weird.
I've spent the better part of a week attempting to fix what was done to my hair.

Trim the top and make sure even...  I guess that translated to, make me look foolish.

Everything looked good until I got home.
My hair is uneven.

I guess you get what you pay for... never again.<//Review>

I get my 2 boys haircut here and have for months now . We tried so many different places always never satisfied with the cuts , once we found Dope barbershop we have never went anywhere else ! Both boys always have sharp haircuts people compliment them on , my 13 year old is really picky on his hair and he loves it every time here . I highly recommend this place< /Text>

Awesome, friendly place. The people there are great at what they do and work with you for what you want. I ended up waiting for a decent length of time due to something that wasn't their fault, and they were still able to accommodate me. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place for a great haircut with awesome atmosphere.< /text>

The name says it all...you want a good cut, this is where you go. Been everywhere in town and I found the best spot. Vince provides a one of a kind service. Don't waste your time and money elsewhere, make sure you get your next cut at DOPE BARBER SHOP.....ASK for Vince...</Text>

I came in as a walk in and waited over a hour, when u came in no one directed me to the list so after waiting for one hour (Hour wait for a walk in at a baber shop is insane) they had another walk in and told that person to put their name on the list. Been to barbers all around the world and never had to wait that long.<//Text>

Scheduled an appointment for 11:30 and ended up leaving after waiting 2 hours. The owner tried to blame me for "not speaking up". I'm sure they cut hair fine but people with appointments who have never gone here before shouldn't be waiting and shouldn't be disrespected< /Review>

It is not our job to pick you up and put you in the chair. Everyone in here could tell you were high on something because you could barely open your eyes..

I went in for cut... did an awful job with the cut.  Uneven sideburns, then dude started to buzz shave my face without asking! I asked him what is he doing he said "lining me up".  He just took his shaver and started shaving before I could do anything.  I'll never go there again</Review>

Nothing "DOPE" about this spot, definitely DO NOT GO , if you don't have an appointment, if you do not know any of the barbers their. Now if you decide to walk in beware...YOU WILL BE THEIR FOREVER!! First time to this spot read their reviews on FB, and of course all good from their homies, friends and you know everyone else who had an incredible experience...lol! Again beware !! Sorry "DOPE" Barber shop but you are definitely NOT DOPE...on any standards in customer time, service etc.</Text>

Not a good choice if you want straight lines! My boyfriend went in for a cut and line up and came out crooked all over. Had to go to another barber to fix it. Not to mention he left with hair pieces still all over the place.</Text>

Little hole in the wall Mexican place. They serve a limited menu but what they lack in items they make up in flavor! I highly recommend all pastor tacos and carne asada/al pastor mixed burrito. It is suitably spicy, greasy, and delicious.< /review>

I highly recommend Taqueria La Soledad if you’re a fan of great Mexican food! Their tacos are so good and the restaurant really has a great atmosphere to it. Somewhat hidden from the main street, but you should stop by when given a chance.<//review>

I've been going here for years. Everything on the menu is amazing. I've been to other taquerias and none compare to la soledad. The prices are good and the warm staff is great. Always greet you with a smile. As others have said, the tacos here are the greatest. Don't miss out on this place .</Review>

Stopped on a whim and found a keeper Clean, friendly, outstanding food. I was pleasantly surprised at the incredible flavor. Not drop you in your tracks spicy but the mix of flavors was outstanding. I had the beef, son had kebabs. Chai was some of the best ever.< /review>

<date>1616171215578< /date>< Review>
'21/3 1st time customer/review:
-- On the hunt for one product...tinted, SPF lip balm. Not carried in store at Walmart or Target; Walgreen's carried until they went under in 2020.
-- With above said, I entered a very well lit/clean store, was greeted by store security, and immediately greeted by perky sales associate asking if she could be of help. From there, I followed her around for five minutes while she attempted to locate what I was specifically looking for. Eureka, with dogged determination, she found it (the only type in entire, huge store...way down at practically ankle-high level on an end-cap shelf obscured by a shelf of the non-SPF product above it (see pic posted of Sun Bum product, comes in 4 tints) . Whew!
-- The cashier was as equally enjoyable/affable when ringing up the order.
-- Great eye contact and desire to engage customer from entrance to exit, plus huge/diverse selection in a clean/secure store gets 5 Stars.
-- Parking note: while Ulta is located in the eastern side-strip in a huge U-shapped shopping center, there are only four stalls right in front of the door/sidewalk--and three of those have now been designated (due to COVID) for curbside delivery. So, be prepared to walk from larger, central parking area which also crosses the one of two busy mall entrance roadways. Handicap parking, while on sidewalk side, is also much further down.< /Review>

I’m normally a Sephora girl, a platinum Sephora girl, but since the pandemic their on-line ordering and returning is a nightmare. So much so that I closed my account with them, I felt forced to try Ulta.
I was pleasantly surprised if the selection that Ulta offers now, and it is seems to be growing constantly. They have a rewards program, coupons and great deals. My new favorite place to buy most of my beauty products.< /Text>

Marcela who was working the register made it very clear she was put out to be bothered helping. The other cashier was working very hard to address the line as well as the store puck up and the phone. The other employees there were wonderful and very helpful. The store was clean.<//Text>

I got multiple confirmations by text and on Ulta's booking website up to an hour before the appointment. I will attach photos. I took a screenshot of my confirmation just in case.

I'm glad I did. I got a call 20 minutes before my appointment from Michelle and this is how the conversation went:
"Hi this is Michelle from Ulta, you had an appointment at 11:15am?"
"Hi, Yes I did."
"I'm sorry, but the books have been glitching and booking appointments over each other. Can you move the appointment to 1pm today or 12:30pm tomorrow?"
"No, I'm sorry. I can't. I work a graveyard shift and have to go to sleep before a certain time. And I have a work event tomorrow all day."
"Oh okay. Thank you!"
"Thanks. Uh-"
I was going to ask if I still had my appointment at 11:15 but she hung up the phone before I could ask.

I went to my appointment, and a male hairdresser helped me at the counter. I said I had an appointment at 11:15 and he said I wasn't on the books. Michelle was at a station working with another girl. He asked who I booked with. I said Michelle and she came to the counter. I repeated that I was there for my appointment and when I tried to pull up my appointment online, it had suddenly vanished. Luckily I had the screenshot from an hour before and showed her. I don't think she was expecting that. She said "Oh I just spoke with you on the phone right? Yeah, I can't do the appointment. The books are weird and if you book online there's an issue. I can do your appointment at 1pm like I said on the phone."

Just to be clear, she never told me that she had literally canceled my appointment 20 minutes before I was supposed to arrive when she talked to me on the phone. Even if she had, that would be unacceptable as I booked this appointment 6 days ago and should have been notified far in advance of 20 minutes before my appointment that there was a booking issue.

I worked as a Guest Service associate at a waxing center for two years. I know exactly how online booking systems work, and I know that my appointment would have shown up in the system, even if it was double booked. Any well trained associate would contact these customers as soon as the issue was noticed. Michelle/Ulta had six days to handle this issue and notify me, and yet they didn't. Michelle was working on a dye job when I got there, and I can tell she waited until the very last minute to call me once she knew for sure she wouldn't be able to do my appointment. That is so incredibly inconsiderate.

She sneakily deleted my appointment off of the books 20 minutes before it was supposed to happen without telling me because she mismanaged her time, and just hoped I wouldn't show up. I have all of the proof in the screenshots I'm attaching to this review.

Michelle, not only did you embarrass me in front of other customers and your coworkers, this was really shady and you should have at least successfully communicated to me that you had canceled my appointment over the phone, even though cancelling someone's appointment 20 minutes prior is unacceptable and completely unprofessional regardless. Even calling me an hour before would have been more polite. But no, I got called 20 minutes before, when I was already on the way there. This whole situation really ruined my day, as I haven't been able to cut my hair in over a year and I was so looking forward to my appointment today. I don't think it's unreasonable to at least be treated with common decency and respect.

I expect to hear back from management about this review. If I don't, I'll be calling the store's manager directly. I have proof of all of this happening the way I said it did in the screenshots. I will not be coming back to this Ulta, and will be going back to see a respectful and kind hairdresser at the Ulta in Delta Shores.

Due to my experience today, I do not recommend booking an appointment with Michelle.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Thomas truly understands color, I've spent so much time and money trying to correct my hair color, nobody was able to achieve what Thomas did for me, I've washed my hair 7 times since thomas colored it and it still looks great! has not faded dramatically as it did when other stylist did my hair. I couldn't be happier with my color and cut. Thomas seems to truly love what he does. In my opinion he's simply the best!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x809add6b467649cb:0x44bb4c43ded9391e<//gmapID></record>

I've been going to this location now for almost 4 yrs. And this is the first time anyone asked me if I needed help or could help me find something. I don't know her name but she was very helpful and new what I was looking for as I couldn't remember the brand name. Nice personality and pleasant. Other times I've come in and just get a hello and no help inless I find a employee.<//Review>

I had a product put on hold, which worked out great! My boyfriend and I wanted to browse and look at the holiday sets plus I wanted to get a few routine items. It wasn’t busy whatsoever so we thought why not we can take our time. As soon as we walked in it felt like the security guard had it out for us. After I claimed my product, I had to use the restroom as I had drove 30 minutes to get said product. She followed us to the back of the store and basically everywhere else we went, we weren’t acting suspicious or anything (I know because I work security) she kept approaching us while obviously agitated asking if we needed anything in a very accusatory manner. We kept saying we were fine thank you because I prefer to browse on my own. Finally she came up to me and demanded I zip my purse closed which I had no problem with until she said “don’t make me check through it!” after that I felt completely alienated so much so I didn’t even want to consider purchasing anything else. So we purchased what I had on hold and left. I get it’s in a bad Neighborhood but jeez not everyone is out to steal stuff. Definitely won’t be returning to this store and possibly any Ulta.

<review>Nice location.  Very convenient. The only reason I give them 1 star is because of the customer service. I went to look for a mascara and eyeliner.  I asked the lady if she could show me the brands and I wanted to try them.  She direct me to where they were but didn't even bother or offer to let me try and see if I like them. I end up buying because I run out of them but they need better service.< /review>< Pics>

Avoid Salon at all costs. In my past 20 years I have never had such a horrible cut/experience. Amateurs work here.  Had my hair dyed and cut initially. Went back to get it fixed and now I can’t even style it properly. Tears*. Leaving a review so you pretty ladies can steer clear away!! Wasted $100, time and my beautiful hair is now gone. Manager tried assisting but reality is, the workers are inexperienced. Pay a little extra and treat yourself to a nice & relaxing session. The entire time my hair was pulled and I was cringing in pain bc of how rough it was. Even after asking the gal to be more gentle. Brushes are dirty & I noticed gunk stuck in the bristles. It’s just all bad. Go somewhere else, please.< /text>

The lady I spoke with VERY arrogantly stated, "We don't do trims here."  There was a moment of silence and pause because hearing that a salon won't do a trim caught me off guard. Eventually I just said, "I've never heard of a salon that won't trim before" and at the end of my sentence the woman cut me off, spoke over me and continued by stating that trims aren't worth their time for the little bit of money it would yield.  .... ..... WOW! I said, "WOW!" out loud and hung up. I WISH I had her name. I just can't flipping believe that attitude.  Also, to concur with another reviewer, twice I was unable to find an employee around the store and once the employee was completely unable to answer my questions about a product.  All three times, the security guard knew where to direct me in the store to find the exact (and rather specific) items I wanted as well as answer questions about a product!! He spends all day in that store observing everyone and everything, so I'm kinda not surprised :)< /Review><Date>1475443417722<//Date><Pics>None</Pics><user>112048570046708347469<//user></record></dataset><record>

Okay so Ulta as a whole is pretty cool but this one is so problematic.   I guess we could start with the fact that they always have a security guard there that likes to conviently be everywhere that you are. Stalking.I think it's rude and does not make me want to spend my money here.   I just go to all of the other Ulta's that don't have rude security guards. I mean I could go on and on but I'll stop right here.< /Review>

I'm happy that there is now an Ulta near me, instead of having to go to Folsom. The employees I've encountered have been nice and as helpful as they can be. I'm not sure how much training they receive but the woman at the Clinique area gave me a foundation that was definitely not a color or tone match even after putting it on my face. Other then that no issues but the store seems picked over and doesn't carry the full range of some of my favorite brands.<//text>

<Text>Horrible customer service at Ulta Beauty in Rancho Cordova upon entering the store they have a security guard / greeter that does not greet you or welcome you in none of the associates welcome you in then they let you walk around Lost don't ask if you need help they just look at you until you ask them and act like they're inconvenience to help you find something had I been greeted and asked if I need help I would have spent way more money than what I spent I was there looking for new products to use but because every associate was at the front counter and there was only one person checking out and no one on the floor I got frustrated and decided to get my usual and just leave!!! That's too bad I guess I'll keep shopping at Sephora instead!!!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< time>

This place is amazing, the staff are awesome and very professional. The only problem is the Theft at this location. The nerve of how people can steal the way they do. I feel very bad for the workers here they deal with crazy thieves. The Security Company sucks . While I was there they was getting ripped off and the guard was sleep. Alright for challenge Security< /text>

The manager is very rude and doesn't follow Ulta policy as well as the staff aren't trained properly. The store is empty and disorganized. Folsom Ulta is only 15 min away and is so much better.<//Text>

We went in to ask about a hair appointment.  We had a few questions that could not be answered so they said they would call us later on that day but never did.  The next day we got a text saying we had booked a hair appointment WHICH WE NEVER DID and called them back to try to cancel it.  After not getting ahold of them the same lady that had helped us the day before finally called us back and it was the same argument from the day before.  She said she would let us know by 4 that same day if she could do my hair.  She never ever called us back.  VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE< /review>

Bad customer service based on "demographics" They gave us a hard time with a return even though we had a receipt and it was returned in a timely manner. Treated us like we stole something and made up excuses why they would not return the items we purchased. HORRIBLE!  Go to another location if possible</Text>

I'm giving 5 stars! The ordered half rack of ribs with Fries, it came with veggies and ranch, and wings, the wings are crispy, huge and delicious! The ribs were meaty and taste pretty good as well!< /Review>

Ribs fall off the bone! Great authentic taste, they make everything from scratch. Great bread sticks. The owner David is very respectful and really cares for his work.< /text>

<Text>Food is great, when the order is right, BUT the front desk (Crystal) is soooooooo beyond rude and disgruntled. Shame- have talked with a few different neighbors who ALL said the exact same thing. She is so bad we all said- “nah, not going to keep supporting that small business while she is still there”!

Ate here today. Got the chicken tenders and a drink. The chicked was plump and juicy. Sauce was good but not over bearing. It's new owners and I was happy with it. When I'm in the area on a job again I will stop in.< /Text>

<text>Had a very horrible experience at this place. Overall, poor service. Screwed my order up completely & then they tried to hustle me to take (2) 8oz coke bottles to go along with the two meals I ordered instead of offering me the 12 oz cans that was exactly the same price. I called them out on that when I was inside, however I didn’t discover that my meal was completely wrong until I got home. I’m just super disappointed and I want the owners of this place to know this and understand it. You guys got to get it together, this is not how you earn repeat business.<//text>< pics>

Extremely disappointed with my order today, paid a good amount for 10 piece boneless wings, they were three times smaller than usual and not worth it. If you're a regular customer like we were you'd understand my disappointment. Normally a 5 piece would fill me up but the ten piece didn't even fill up my three year old. Too bad it won't let me upload a photo< /review>

<text>Food was great. The ribs peel off the bone and have little fat. The pork fries were huge and tasty. Sliders are a great deal. Everything was delicious. Much better than Phil's and much more affordable. Just don't plan on eating in because they only have about 3 tables.</text>< Pics>

Our favorite now.  Ribs melt in your mouth.  Wings are well liked by the family as well.  Generous portions.  And every time we have been there, fries were great.  Bought all of the above for a fishing club meeting last night, everyone loved it.</text>

The wings are nice and juicy though id recommend you ask for extra sauce because they don't drown the wings in sauce like in epic wings, the fries are also really lit. I haven't tried the ribs though will definitely give them a try next time I go here. Sadly the last time I went here the Cajun sauce on the fries was pretty salty. This hasn't happened before so I think this is only a one time thing.</Text>

<text>We love the food! Never disappointed and highly reccomend this place :) The portions are great and we eat there at least once a week now. A few of our favorites are the lemon pepper chicken (strips or wings), sweet and chile chicken, pulled pork fries, and carnitas fries. Prices are great for what you pay and staff are always very friendly.</text>< user_id>

Ordered 5 Atomic Hot wings, 5 Original Hot wings, 1/4 ribs with fries and a side of bread sticks. Atomic hot wings were a joke, not hot and tasted like they spilled the cayenne pepper on it, just bad flavor. The original hot wings were tasty. The ribs were dry and the BBQ sauce was bland. Bread sticks were bland and boring. For a place with "wings" and "ribs" in the name, they need to step up their game quite a bit. Will not be returning.</Text>

<name>Jenna Hartsook</name><Review>My husband and I ordered through Ubereats.

We ordered two 5-piece wings, jalapeno poppers, one soda, and one boneless wing 3-piece combo (sauce on the side) which comes with veggies, a soda, and a side (fries or breadsticks). The food is supposed to also come with dressing. They were out of breadsticks which we knew when we ordered.

Items missing from our order included veggies, a soda, and dressing. The order was basically worthless to me without ranch. Who sends out wings without ranch??? They also did not put the sauce on the side of the boneless wings as requested.

We called the store to let them know and the woman who answered admitted she accidentally put our veggies in another order. She offered a discount on our next purchase but I indicated I’d rather have our money back on this order so I could decide whether to visit again. At that point I wasn’t planning on returning pending how this situation was handled. The woman at that point became sort of rude and basically indicated they would not refund us anything on this order.  Items paid for were blatantly missing and I cannot believe they wouldn’t refund us. We are disputing through Ubereats and don’t plan to return due to how this was handled.

We did begrudgingly eat the food we received as my husband just got home from an 8 day business trip and we weren’t about to drive when we’d ordered delivery. The fries, wings, and poppers were decent as far as food goes. The boneless wings were tough. Fyi also, they are more like large chunks of breast meat than typical breaded wings (which may be a plus for some people).

Good luck.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Good Chipotle fries. Sliders pretty good,but will be sure to ask for extra sauce next time.O rings and jal. Poppers are just average. May try a different loaded fry,and the ribs next time,since they are close.
Staff was super nice,but did not get his name.<//Review>

As a student, I find myself searching for meaningful distractions all the time and I have enjoyed the museum as my home during those times. My only wish is that there be more interactive features for kids and adults since that seems to be an issue with people visiting (people keep trying to touch things even though that is prohibited). Love the staff and the atmosphere. Would go again.< /Review><Date>1576821322565<//Date>< user_name>

<Text>Our first time here and what a wonderful experience.  Everyone was so kind and hey it was a free exhibit.  They rotate their art out, I believe they said, every three months.  So there's always something to see.  Parking is by a $10 for a 2 hour pass or coin machines where 25 cents gets you 10 minutes.   Overall a fantastic place to visit.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFotEtxkyIStxo_jNpYToiW6hRMjIJ11t_BYsJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzYxE-XwsiUnyc_f3Ggx386BTweMSK7sVQEoBf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeg3_UKywweeRcz4jkuy5ncyMMPsSPlzrpQyUn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

Lovely, welcoming place. Elegant, young staff gave us our bearings and informed us of the zero entrance fee. They had an artist led work project we could attempt...on my birthday I made a Korean layered paper piece of art. The artist was way beyond kind, helpful and informative.<//Text>

Amazing space in Davis. It is always free and is great sized museum to visit for 30 mins or an hr. Should be part of everyone's visit. Pair with a walk through the arboretum.<//text>

Worth a visit if you're in Davis and showcases some wide ranging art pieces. Also great for current students if you're tired of looking at the upside down heads on campus all day.</review>< Rating>

<review>This beautiful, well designed modern art museum is on the Davis campus.   The opening reception of the new show was fun.  There was a large area set up outside for kids to make things and explore their creativity.   Food, desserts, and drinks, in the form of flavored water, was available. A musician provided entertainment. And the art exhibits were extensive and informational.  It's always enlightening to see a show here because it's something you don't see anywhere else.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Super spacious and welcoming environment. The art museum is free for the public and honestly was very fun to look at the different art pieces that was offered at the museum. There’s no photography allowed.< /review>

Beautiful grounds! I didn’t go into the museum, I was here for a photography meetup so we just shot outside around the museum grounds.

The grounds are beautiful and amazing! Definitely would love to come back and check out the museum.

UC Davis is a really beautiful campus.<//Text>

<name>Steve Jewkes< /name><review>The Kaltenbach exhibit (opening today) was a refreshing look at this conceptual artist turned "traditionalist". The exhibit spans from the late 60s to now. Since I've only experienced his recent work, it was good to see/understand his earlier "conceptual period"...it provided new insight into his more recent pieces- the docents and staff were very friendly and wanted to help you get immersed into the exhibit. The museum itself is surprisingly first rate. All in all (docents/staff, exhibit presentation, and the museum itself), this UC Davis museum gave me a great, thoughtful experience...wish I could have stayed longer today to actually meet Stephen Kaltenback!<//review>< time>

<Text>Situated on the UC Davis campus, just off Highway 80, the Minetti Shrem museum is a stylish oasis. And it's always free to enter, which I appreciate.

I enjoyed the approach and easy parking, the big gong is fun and resonant, the entry way is dramatic, and the museum is welcoming, stylish, and feels good.

The museum itself, as well as its artistic contents, provokes thought, just as any good art should.

The museum is well worth stopping into and then wander around the campus for a while...<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80852913e08a80ed:0xea01eae2570bbe72< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Beautifully designed facility. I love that it's free to the public. The wishing tree feature is my favorite part. If you love to take pictures and although photography is allowed here, beware of the No Photography labels that are sometimes unnoticeable around the installations. Great place to spend an hour or two looking at art, whether for a quick day trip or date.<//review>< Name>

A great little art gallery/museum with some stylish architectural features - lovely sweeping roof/front porch, glass-walled inside courtyard, artists studio.
Recently saw the 'Thiebaud' exhibition there. Well worth seeing!
No sign of any place to have a coffee/cake, but maybe I haven't explored enough. Parking is easy - very accessible and FREE!</Text>

Nice space. Nice size. Beautiful entry. Only complaint: this is on a college campus and they don't allow visitors wearing backpacks (??). They provide free locker to store but the lockers are too tiny to accommodate. Annoying rules but otherwise decent visit, currently underutilized but hopefully in the future....</Review>

The building is beautiful and unique. You almost need to touch the concrete walls to believe theyre actually concrete! The interior is well designed as well. On my last visit, the exhibit was not particularly interesting,. It the museum is free and they have no permenant collection that I'm aware of. So visit once a season and see what's in there!< /Review>

O.M.G. this place is amazing. They have a walk in art studio where you can make your own crafts. The perfect place to destress for university students!
In addition, they have a big gallery where you can indulge yourself in the art you like.

Various coffee drinks and other beverages are provided at a small charge.
Come visit it before you graduate from UC Davis!!<//Review>

Small space but well-curated. Most of the docents are college students from UC Davis and are very happy to answer questions that you might have. The galleries are well maintained, like a slice of an art museum you might find in a larger city.< /text>

I drove to Davis from SF today  July 1, 2017 from SF after checking the website for hours open.  It read open 11AM-5PM however, on arrival I learned it is closed July 1-Sept17.  You need to UPDATE your WEBSITE!<//Review>

<Text>Beautifully designed museum with contemporary shows with work from UC Davis students as well as their private collection and guest artists. I've been to a couple receptions there as well and they usually have interdisciplinary things such as music from the music department and poetry readings, etc.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I’m from New Jersey and we have a lot of diners there. I can tell you that this place is a legitimate diner that can compare to NJ’s best. I recommend ordering the French toast cinnamon rolls. Freakin’ delicious!</Review>

Sunny's Restaurant is one of the last TRULY GREAT Family Style, American Restaurants, that I know of in this area. I have been eating at Sunny's for (at least) 30 years (on & off) now. Over the years, I've had the pleasure not only of trying everything on the menu, at one time or another, but also of getting to know the Terrific service staff. In addition to the Waiters/Waitresses, it's been my honor to become good friends with the owners/founders of Sunny's, Andy & Cindy, as well as their kids (roughly my age) Summer & Shadow. Now for the Good Stuff™:
THE FOOD-
All of the food served at Sunny's is prepared the Old-Fashioned way. For example, if you order a turkey sandwich, it's prepared with freshly (in-house) roasted turkey, carved straight off the bird. This style of fresh made food (never canned or frozen), carries through to all the dishes they make. I LOVE the Daily Specials, because they are usually -$2 Off the full menu price. On Monday, I ordered my FAVORITE Dinner, 1/2 Fried Chicken Dinner. The chicken is better than KFC, Popeye's, Church's, etc. Soup or Salad, Choice of Veg, Choice of Potato, Choice of Bread. All this for about $10.
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Sunny's Restaurant to anyone with a Good Appetite!< /text>

First time here, but gotta say this won't be the last.  The service was amazing,  from the server to the hostes.  Friendly and courteous.  The food was great,  I had the full rack of ribs and it was amazing.  Will definitely be coming back here again.< /Review>

<review>Food was OK not the best not the worst. My omelet was a little wet on the inside, probably from the green peppers and onions. I really enjoyed this place in the past, but have the feeling things have changed. The other thing I noticed was a lot of flies in the dinning area which kinda grossed me out. I probably won't be coming back any more.<//review>< Pics>

I think this is one of my favorite places to dine when go to California and the meals are a throw back to my military days. Opened and ran by a marine at one time and r as n in the same manner now. The staff is excellent the food is a throw back to my military days. If you served five if a try. If not give it a try. You will enjoy.</Review>

<Text>Coming here was like traveling in time, in the good old times in which you could have a hearty but nutricional breakfast at excellent prices and magnificent service included.
Definitely recommend this place to everyone, you won't be dissapointed at all.
The menus for morning afternoon or evening dining are great with a variety of choices that satisfy any appetite, and reinforce GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
DON'T MISS IT, if in Orange County.< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Pictures>

Very nice place to visit really good comfort food very good prices and the staff is the bomb very nice people family-owned. Try the turkey dinner they have during it's about eleven or twelve dollars but you get at least 4-5 servings out of it easy and it tastes great!!! Also the roast beef and serranos sandwich I believe is really good teether turkey and Serrano or roast beef but it's a hot sandwich it's so yummy<//Text>

My first time dining at Sunny's! What a delightful experience. Being from the south, I thoroughly enjoy homestyle country cooking. The Thanksgiving style turkey dinner was incredible. I also love large portions. Like most southerners I have a large appetite. I actually brought part home cause I couldn't finish it. Can't wait to go back for breakfast and for sure Thursday for beef stroganoff! A special shout out to Natalie who is an absolute top notch waitress. Service perfection!<//Text>

Good value for the price. Better than the majority of "family restaurants". Loved my steak. It was 3/4" thick and cooked medium rare. New England clam chowder was good but tasted more like a gumbo soup. Service was helpful and freindly.  I do building maintenance as a job and noticed the place looking very clean and despite being an older building well maintained- certainly the best in this area for a family style restaurant.< /Text>

You can have a lovely family meal in a family atmosphere.  A number of the reviews appearing have nothing to do with this very nice restaurant and it's hard working staff. They are expressing political  views that have no place hurting these people working hard to make a living. Give Sunny's a try they are very nice.</review>< pics>

I had a bacon avocado burger that was pretty decent,  but would've been great if the meat had been seasoned. The fries were also pretty good, but if they'd also had seasoning and were a tad crisper, they would've been perfect. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.

I'll definitely return!< /review>

Nice family friendly diner near Goldenwest College. Been coming here for years.

Food: Decent at the least.  Burgers, sandwiches and breakfast is what you expect to be good at a place like this... and it does not disappoint. I love the salad dressing and iced tea as well.

Price: a little pricey for a diner. But this is HB so it’s not far from expectation.

Service: In the past, I was never impressed with the service at Sunny’s.  But in the past year it has been much better.  I would say GOOD service basing it on 2018 forward. Maybe they have some new waiters or management.  Not sure, but quality recently.

We never have to wait to get seated. That’s important.

I can go to Denny’s for the same food and maybe a bit cheaper. But I like the atmosphere here and great location.<//Text>

This restaurant is one of my favorites. It is very near where I live. The kitchen is very flexible about letting you personalize your menu, within reason. I would have to agree the service needs a lot of improvement ~ it is luck of the draw. The fried zucchini, all the food is very good. Very casual.<//text>

Me and my family have been coming here for years. I love the environment and people here so much. It has always reminded me of my grandparents, even though some of them have passed on. It just gives you warmth when you walk in and reminds you of family. I just wished the beef stroganoff was a daily menu item! 😂< /review>

Overall, their food is pretty good; their service is okay. Considering that when one is famished, and doesn't feel like waiting up to a half an hour or more to be seated at the better restaurants in Huntington Beach, this place is always there as an option.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd2133e97ba601:0x4b7126722b2b9882</Gmap_id></record>

Needs an upgrade. It had a foul odor the day I arrived and my water tasted like chlorine. The oil in the fryer must have been very old because it tasted poorly and was burned.  The waitress HAD to see it to serve it, which was shocking.  Or she just didn't care.< /text>

The service was nice. It was my first time there. The food I ordered wasn't that great. It was a turkey and swiss omelet and they just took a slice of processed cheese and sat it on top and it wasn't even melted. They may have other good food though. But that was disappointing<//Text>

If you want a real family style restaurant that serves an excellent breakfast all day, then go to Sunny's. Friendly staff clean and food like your mom makes if your mom is an excellent cook. Oh, and reasonably priced too! The menu is full of favorites!</Text>

I imagine that's due to whatever cook is working that day or shift.  I ordered breakfast a few things which was really good but then I ordered fish& Chips that was HORRIBLE! . The Waitresses are not the best either but they mostly are younger girls With not so much of a personality .

So I would say,  go ahead and try Sunny"s since the right chef may be working that day.</text>< pics>

One hour from meal, both suffered stomach aches! Wendy, restaurant "owner" was extremely RUDE trying to force us to pay bill BEFORE finishing meal, and refused to provide RECEIPT, saying to look at credit card bill when it arrived! She got angry because one fork and spoon were dirty and I asked for another, plus extra napkins; she left the one which wrapped the dirty fork and spoon and only brought ONE. Suspect PREJUDICE (?)I can't understand the animosity, although of the 2 times we have been there, only two other people were there in the WHOLE RESTAURANT! NEVER going back, hopefully she won't over change credit card, because she REFUSED to give us a receipt, and if she does, she'll probably claim it was "a mistake". 😕 What? No ZERO Rating?< /review>

Normally I'm not a fan of chain's like Denny's or I-Hop or such so when my mother dragged my here for breakfast I went grudgingly. To my surprise though the breakfast was on point. Not many restaurants know how to correctly make eggs sunny side up but their's is on point every time. Best part is the portions are HUGE. I wanted to dislike this place..but I actually love it. Best breakfast.</Text>

She refused to give me a bag despite giving bags to other customers, claimed she ran out. When I asked for the owner, the waitress said it was the rude blonde. I asked the rude blonde her name and was told none of my business. I mentioned I would mention her attitude and lack of hospitality in my yelp review she told me to go right ahead. Felt discriminated and not welcomed at all. She was rude and insulting in front of other customers. Not at all the pleasant dinner I had hoped for with my mother before mother's day . If I could give zero stars I would.</text>< user_name>

<Review>Really good quality food and service. A really relaxed environment with genuine staff and hearty, but not greasy food. A personal thanks to Summer and the nice waitresses; I left a very expensive DSLR which is very important and meaningful to me and it was kept safe until the next day - this means a lot to me. The warmest thank you to the team.< /Review>< pics>

I eat here regularly and really enjoy this place. I've enjoyed Sunny's for about 10 years. Note-if you're looking for some hipster, fusion, happening place then this probably isn't for you. Sunny's is old school, diner, American food. The prices are reasonable and the food good, basic fare. Their portions are generous and the variety seems wide.

They have wonderful, hearty breakfasts and I have enjoyed everything I've ordered over the years although I'm partial to the Country Breakfast. They have daily dinner specials that are a good deal and seasonal specials, all of which are good deals and tasty food.

As for the staff, everyone I've encountered over the years has taken reasonably good care of us and, because I've eaten there over such a long period of time, they will recognize me and extend a warm welcome.

I agree that this is probably a place favored by a slightly older crowd and that's just fine with me. There are also families and a variety of ages that I've seen there too. I don't think I've seen any hipsters, though, so maybe not the place to go if you're looking for someplace trendy and hip.

Maybe one of the reasons for a preponderance of negative reviews on Google is the fact that the older people, and there are a bunch, who eat there aren't as familiar with social media, online review sites, and the importance of online reviews. They just now that they enjoy Sunny's and are probably okay that not everyone is as into the Sunny's experience like they are.

As for the decor, yeah, they could probably do with an update or refresh; however, as we all know, when that happens the ambiance, and some would say "charm" of the place would change, as well as the prices, undoubtedly. However, they entire center where Sunny's is located has undergone an exterior remodel/modernization that, as of this review, is nearly complete. Consequently, the outside is looking much cleaner and more modern but the interior is mostly unchanged.

I understand that people's experiences can vary widely in any service industry but I would encourage anyone who's thinking about eating at Sunny's to give it a try and come with an open mind. Don't let the haters discourage you; who knows, maybe you'll find the charm in this place as I have done. In a way, it's kind of like going back in time to when you could go to a neighborhood diner and just eat good food with friends.

Enjoy!<//Text>

This place is great, they always make me feel like i'm in an old fashion diner. The food is really good, and its a family business which is really nice too! if you're looking for a nice diner, give Sunny's a shot, you wont be sorry.</Text>

Not from HB, son had a B-ball game near here so we stopped in for a quick bite. Food was great, service was FANTASTIC! Even though we live in Orange my wife and my son wants to come back soon. Excellent spot to eat, and here is a swap meet across the street at the college on the weekends.</Review>

I was here a couple weeks ago on business and wanted something local not chain. Well, I think a truck stop diner would've been a better choice! Not sure where this "family" restaurant gets their recipes from, but I wouldn't step in this establishment ever again.<//Text>

Typical diner fare. Service is friendly and quick. Lots and lots of the elderlies. It's a place where old timers go to get their familiar food. You can sit for hours doing the crossed puzzle. The waiters and service staff recognize the regulars . Nothing fancy in terms of food ..just like a Denny's ..but friendlier . Credit card accepted . Parking can get difficult during weekends. People go to the swap meet across the street before or after eating.< /review>

I love Sunny's! I've been a loyal customer for years and this is my favorite little restaurant in HB. Avoid the potato skins and other than that, everything is great! The waitresses are always very kind, the prices are perfect, the food is great, and the whole ambiance is very homey. I feel so comfortable in Sunny's, and they even have a little book exchange to the left of the door when you walk in!</review>

<text>This is my favorite restaurant for breakfast. Andrew, Summer, and the rest of the staff are personable and offer a wonderful menu. The Ortega Chile quesadilla, salads, and homemade soups are personal favorites with mimosa.  Many of the customers are regulars like us.< /text>< name>

Went on YELP to complain about the service I received and my response was from the owner who went on a rant about Hillary Clinton and the crooked government, and then I googled her. She tried to sue Trump for sexual harrassment. Who is this lady? And why would I ever want to do business with her ever again? Now I have more than one reason to never visit this over priced place. I will tell everyone I know about my experience. As an owner of a business the customer is always right, if the service was bad, you address it, apologize, and make it right so they come back. Duh!</text>

The core/heart of Sunny's has never changed. The same attitude and customer service shines through no matter how they spell the name or what the exterior looks like. If you want good food at a decent price in a friendly atmosphere Sunny's is the place to go.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>I've been coming here since we moved here 9 years ago.  Not too often but this is the place when I want a great full filling breakfast it reminds me of back home in North Carolina.

O'Brian Potatoes extra well done my favorites...WARNING: The toast is usually drenched in butter so you may want to say dry toast.  The cafe is great quality.

I am René the Barber, only @ ABC3 BARBER STUDIO & I highly recommend this place.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating><pics>None</pics></record>

I haven't been there recently but GOOGLE you need to review these posts..  They all started the same month that it was announced the owner was suing Trump.  Really not a fair assessment.< /Text>

<review>Came here with the hub one one day for a late lunch. Staff wasn't very welcoming, very clicky with some obvious regulars. We were treated like an afterthought. The food, while there were old classic options, tasted like it was frozen and reheated. I can't imagine how this place stays open.< /review><UserId.>108274895648464939525<//UserId.>< rate>

Waitress, was rude, place smelled like BO, wasn't what if call clean, the eggs were runny and cold. The manager said she'd replace the meals but never came back. We could see her laughing and flirting with another customer. We waited for about 40 min, estimated our bill for the drinks we had actually gotten and left cash. We went to McDonald's afterward since she took our plates and we couldn't eat and received better food and service, I think that says it all. Worse than McDonald's.<//text>

First of all I must be honest and say the place smelled like human feces. The tables were very dirty. There was trash on the floor. The bathrooms were disgusting. The food was not fresh and it was of low quality and it even tasted like I was eating cardboard.  The staff were unattentive. I even overheard the employees saying that the owner turns tricks in the back storage room. Horrible experience and probably the worst restaurant I've ever been too.< /Review>

Service was super friendly and the decor was reminiscent of an old diner complete with service at the bar for single patrons. The portions were huge and the prices fair, but finding healthy food was a challenge on their menu.<//review>

Food was decent, but it was more like your typical breakfast food. I felt this place was very average and not worth the trip if you are outside of the area.</text>

My mom and I decided to try out Sunny's on our way to my sisters birthday party recently. What a mistake. My salad was completely inedible and had so much salt, it almost burnt my lips.

I was in HB two weeks ago and at at this restaurant. I got very sick and had to go to the emergency room. When I called to speak to the manager, I was told the owner would call me back. The owner never called me back. I would not recommend this restaurant. The silverware was dirty, the seats were sticky and the service was poor. There are way better options in the area.</text>

<review>I was in for breakfast and ordered one of the egg dishes. Later that day I was sick.
The dish had egss and grilled veggies cheese.
I ordered side of bacon and toast.
The silverware was dirty. The waitress had her hair down and it was long. There was also ketchup on my seat and all over the salt and pepper shaker.</review>< pictures>

Sunny's is a classic family restaurant. Thier food is reliably good and everything on thier menu is comfortable. There are no frilly fusion dishes, just the classics and they are done well. The best thing is the kids menu .  It comes with a free prize ticket for your kids to choose from after the meal.  it is a great incentive for good behavior.</text>

Possibly a off day... greasy eggs, burnt toast, slow service, sorta pricey, and just a below average visit.

Possibly give this place one more try before taking it off the list of places to take people.</review>

Can I say Zero stars? Terrible food...worse than Denny's. Bad coffee. The host and waitress were impersonal, slow and uncaring. Awful lighting as well. I regret my 8% tip out of guilt...should have been less.< /Review>

<Text>I would like to give no stars but I first just say dont go here.  I waited 25 minutes and didnt even get a water in front of me.  When I noted to the server she said oh I thought you were still waiting for people.  After that I had to walk up to her while she served guests that just arrived.  Once I made the decision to get up and leave the front desk person yelled at me and my family to "go sit and they would take care of our drinks."  I worked in the service industry for 10 years and have never experienced this type of behavior by anyone or tplace.  This place is a disgrace and should be closed.  Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere ✔< /Text>< pics>

This is absolutely the WORST dining experience I have ever had. The manager YELLS at the waitresses in front of customers. I asked two of the waitresses and they said they get YELLED at if they try to take their lawful 10 minute break. The air conditioning is basically OFF, and it is sweltering inside as it was hot outside. There are HUNDREDS of places to eat, why would ANYONE choose this crappy run down hole....I will tell everyone I know how poorly this place is run.</text>

This review is a little bit late in coming. The first time I walked in to Sunny's, I was about 11yo. In April, I'll be 43. OK, OK, A LOT LATE IN COMING. I thinks that it's difficult to right a fair review when you know people forever, but I'm gonna try.
1) The Food: This isn't the type of restaurant that you see every day (especially anymore). I'll explain. If you order a turkey sandwich, for example, they carve fresh turkey from the birds that they Freshly Roasted that day. Their soups are not "frozen in a bag" they a Freshly crafted by their talented kitchen staff.
This is how all restaurants used to be, or so I've been told.
2)The People: I'll try to be brief. The Zervos family has been in the restaurant business for an incredibly long time. Andy, the patriarch has run numerous restaurants in Orange County, even another Sunnys which used to be in South H.B. The Zervos family and their staff are more than mere restaurateurs. They are the people who remember your name. The ones who ask about family members, when they haven't seen them in too long. They are the people who sent home an order of soup, when they heard I was sick.
To sum it up, Andy, Cindy, their Children, and staff, are like family. It's like eating at your favorite aunt's house. It's being surrounded by people who care, and people you care about in return.
3)The Restaurant: Sunny's just completed a HUGE exterior renovation, and it couldn't look better outside. Haven't seen any noticeable changes inside yet, but I'm Certain that it is only a matter of time before they get to that also. I will be very honest, the interior is significantly dated in appearance. I know that can be a turn off to some people who are looking for the newest hippest spots. This isn't new or hip. It's Classic, a bit dated, and the food, service, and staff, are the BEST that you are likely to find, ANYWHERE in Orange County.< /text>

I was so disappointed in the food here. It was basically cafeteria quality food and my eggs were not even cooked, the whites were still runny. I told a friend about my experience and she pointed out the restaurant was shut down a few months back for a cockroach issue. I'm totally turned off to trying this restaurant again.</text>

The food is terrible, the owner is a extremely unhelpful and rude. When my food wasnt made how I ordered it she acted like she was annoyed, and told me there's nothing she could do about it. If I didn't like it I could go somewhere else. There was also a fly in my ice cube! Disgusting! "You're fired"< /Review>

Walked into the entrance and stood there for at least 5 minutes and no one, no one at all approached us. In fact there wasn't anyone at the counter or register. We stood there long enough to notice the fruit flies crawling all over the chocolate chip cookies in the cookie case though.<//text>

<Review>This place is the worst you walk into the restaurant and it smells bad
you try to get seated guys watching TV ignoring all the customers waited to be seated what's up with that
guy tells me he's the owner guys a loser anyway the
food was I would give it up 3 out of 10 stars as far as everything else they don't have a place to put - stars on this
Their place is a joke terrible
I'd rather eat at Denny's<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Horrible.  I have stopped in here twice to have breakfast before coming to work and could not get waited on!  The first time took forever.  The second time the waiter walked by me 3 times and ignored me but waited on a couple that had just walked in the door.  I got up and left and told the manager that was the last time I came in this dump.<//Text>< rating>
