They sprayed our house last June and did a poor job. Ants were still showing up. When we called and told them the situation they said it would take another $75 for them to come respray even though they didn't do a good job the first time. This is the 2nd time this has happened. Frankly most of the sprayers they send are completely clueless and don't understand how to property mix the poison or spray correctly. Normally I wouldn't do business with this type of place but it's the landlords call not mine.</Review>

<Review>Planet Orange is a very great company for termite control. I have been a customer for more than 5 years now.  Because of their great service and treatment of termites, I still have a good house to live in. There are no more termites in the areas after they did the treatment. I have a three story house. Some areas were very difficult to reach, but they found a way to do the treatment anyway.  Planet Orange is the company you can count on for taking care of your home that has termites. I will highly recommend to all the people I know!

Such an overdue review, but planet orange has been great at keeping my home pest free.  Last year during holidays was a nightmare so the first thing I did this year is to make a resolution to kill pests...planet orange has helped me keep this resolution.  The biggest help is the call to confirm the appointment so I at least know when they are coming.  Looking to only having family this holiday season and not uninvited pests.</Review>

I cannot say enough how pleased I am with my termite treatment.  I just had my annual check up...all clear!  Both teams have been great...they wear little blue foot booties in my home without me even asking...a nice touch.

The office is nice and respectful and answer my questions when 8 have them.

I would use again but based on my first treatment it looks as though I will not have too....this is a good feeling to have.

Thank you planet orange for putting my mind at ease.<//text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I scheduled an 8:30 appointment with this company.  At 8:45 I called to ask where their person was.  I was told that he was "delayed due to traffic, probably school traffic." I was told that he could make it between 10:00 and 10:30.

This sounded fishy to me.  Traffic does not cause a 2 hour delay, and if there is traffic,  I could have been called beforehand to be notified.

5 minutes later, I got a call from their agent who said that he had called me to let me know of the delay and had left a voicemail.  There was no voicemail nor no call received from him.  5 minutes is just the amount of time it would take for their office to call and speak to this guy and to have him call me.  Sounds fishy to me.

The guy said that he could make it between 10:30 and 11:30 because he was coming from Daly City and had an appointment in San Francisco first.  This was, perhaps, the only believable thing I heard from Planet Orange all morning.

Thankfully, their business ethics became apparent well before I considered doing business with them.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Have used them twice for ants.  First treatment a year ago lasted all summer at eradication.  Just had second and so far so good.  Really nice courteous technicians.  Very thorough job.
Also used their rodent service for rats in crawl space coming in through where AC return runs in.  They plugged the gap and lay traps.  My AC stopped working right after but they sent someone immediately to check it and were super nice about agreeing to cover if their technician at fault.  It turned out to be coincidental that the capacitor had blown but I totally appreciated the extremely helpful customer service team and have no doubt they would have honored the fix if they had been at fault.

Highly recommend.  Very trustworthy company with a great product too!<//text>

<Text>Pests be gone!  This was almost like magic.  Setting up appt was a snap and chose the monthly program.  The on.y way I know they come is there are no more bugs!!  Actually, they do confirmation calls, so I do know they come.  However, my kids continue to try to find the bugs they used to see and they are so disappointed they cannot find them.  Such a relief.

The quote we received from Planet Orange was over three times their competitors, using the same treatments (over $6000 for approximately 1,200 square feet).  The technician put huge holes in our siding- we knew we had some soft areas, but it was nice having the exterior paint seal intact.  He had to use substantial strength to break through completely.  Now we have had rain for five days and the areas he broke through are in much worse shape!  We had a contractor out to see if we can fix the area ASAP and he was also shocked by the damage caused by the inspection.  We wish we had never called them!</text>

Sometimes you get good service from a company.  Sometimes you get bad service from a company.  But I love the consistency great service I get from Planet Orange.  If you have questions - they have answers.  They have always been willing to work with me to help ensure my home remains pest free each and every month.

The prices are good and I lie the monthly visit to my home instead of the quarterly visits I used to get from another.

Keep up the great work.</Text>

Really excited to have found this company.  The experience has nothing short of outstanding from the process of setting an inspection to the completion of treatment.  I have a two year warranty with an opportunity extend at the end of this period.

There was a smooth transition from the inspection to the treatment.  Everyone one was one time and professional.

They also warranty their work which is a plus.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>Nice employees and a great service if you get them to call you back. Always a message machiene and no call backs unless you are a new customer. Works great on all pest inside and out.  I hate 4 hour wait Windows make it hard to have a life or get you kids. I put up with it because the product works and I appreciate a nontoxic solution. I wish they could fix their customer support and wait times.  They wont wait 4hrs for you<//text>< Pics>

I wish all companies operated like this company. I had heard from alot if my friends about them . They came in gave a bid and got the work done and even did some extra stuff for free. We had questions, they took more than an hour to explain and describe the process . I will definitely use them again.< /Review>

I guess one gets what they pay for...I switched companies after several bad experiences and luckily found planet orange.  I paid a little more but the difference was so noticeable and so much better.

Our tech has always called in advance and asks if there are any specific areas of concerns.  Most of theytime it is a basic treatment, but sometimes we need a little extra attention around the garage.

I signed up for monthly service since 5hey use botanical pesticides and this frequency seems to keep the little critters in check.

I have referred a few co workers and they seemed to had had similar experience since they have not said anyth8ng bad .

Happy I found planet orange!,,</review>

Used them for almost a year and was not satisfied with their work! They didn't exterminate the bugs! Everytime they would come would only be for like 10 min to spray some liquid. I would tell em it wasn't working and they would bring another liquid that didn't work either! Save your money and go with a better company that actually knows how to do their job 👎👎</Text>

I'm surprised by the negative reviews on here and it makes me wonder if the negative reviews are competitors who use those traditional, potent poisons and can't stand that this company has a great alternative for people to choose.

The experience that I had with this company is they came out to abate my insect issue, they failed had to come out a second time. And every since I've been receiving spam phone calls and emails from this company they're idiots they don't know what kind of work they've done to my house keep asking me to get a termite treatment when their inspection revealed no termites absolute morons. If anyone cares to contact me and clarify the issues that I've been having I'd be happy to take this down.</text>

<text>First I had a problem with customer service insisting that a walkthrough of the entire home would need to be done for termite inspection. I posted a poor Yelp review and the manager contacted me to clear this up. When the inspector came he was polite and respectful of my home (these two reasons I'm giving this two stars instead of one) He found subterranean termites, which is not a surprise for this house. I got a second opinion the next week from another company with an inspection finding of drywood termites. I then had a third opinion to confirm that the drywood termites are definitely prevalent. Both took pictures, no mistaking. It's surprising that Planet Orange's technician missed it.
Also I had them all check the attic for possibility of rats, and Planet Orange tech said it was fine, clean. Subsequent inspections from the other companies found definite evidence of rat invasion.
Also I'll add that they charge way more than the other companies charge for subterranean termites.
It seems that at least one of Planet Orange's technicians needs more training.< /text>< pictures>

Signed up for the monthly service. Scheduled a 2 hour time window to get service. Technician called me half hour outside of time window; maybe he showed up at my house maybe he did't I couldn't wait longer. Two more attempts, two more of the same story.

Called my account manager and they were "sending a supervisor" Same situation. I called corporate half hour after the time limit expired and couldn't get an answer.

Might have been a good product, but me and the bugs that are living with me won't ever know.

**EDITED**

My concerns were escalated to the Director level and within days there was someone at my house to take care of the spraying. There was no strong chemical smell and I noticed a reduction of some of the pests within a day. Very pleased with this choice in pest control.

Rocky start, but once things got rolling, I think this is will be a great relationship.< /text>

<Review>Quite impressed with palnwt orange.  The thing that made them different from what I expected was the personal followup call I receives shortly after treatment.  Too many rimes it feels as though a company says they care but you do not feel that way.  Getting the call to ensure everything was complete and no outstanding issues was great.

Excellent job by jameain and team.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

If you'd like to work with an unreliable and unprofessional company, this is the place.

I scheduled a Saturday morning appointment with them a week prior to the date for a termite inspection and they called me 15 minutes before the appointment to tell me the inspector wasn't coming and our appointment was cancelled. My husband and I are in the process of buying a house so we needed the place inspected by Monday morning at the latest per our contract with the seller. Instead of working with us to get an inspection on time, they just said they couldn't do it and that was it. How about rearranging one of your inspector's schedules, contacting any of them just to double check, or even hiring an additional person for situations like these where it's clearly your fault for backing out at the last minute? It's the least you can do considering that you charge your customers a fee if they cancel last minute. Can I charge you a fee for wasting my, my husband's, and my agent's time because none of us live where the house is and we all had to commute there on a Saturday morning for nothing? I spent the rest of the day scrambling for another company who could arrange for a last minute or Monday inspection.

Given that I made this appointment a week ahead of time, I could have hired any other termite company and wouldn't have run into this problem. Unfortunately I picked Planet Orange and that's the last time I'll ever pick this place. This company seriously lacks responsibility and reliability. I would never recommend this place to anyone.

It is unprofessional to cancel last minute and not show up to a scheduled appointment. It's even more unprofessional to not do whatever it takes to work with that customer on something with a deadline. Of course the scheduler proceeds to tell me that they work with people in escrow who need inspections in a timeline all the time, then doesn't proceed to give me a solution. If this is how you handle these situations, then it's really pathetic.

Do not come here unless you have plenty of time on your hands and don't mind having to reschedule at their convenience.</text>

When looking fora company to to BOTH termite and General Pest - Planet Orange seemed to stand out.  As most people who are wanting to have a company be a service provider-I not only did research, but also had multiple companies come to my home.

Planet Orange not only arrive on time, but also coordinated the Pest Team and the Termite team to come at the same time - very considerate of a customer's time.

Both were very knowledgeable of how to solve my issues as well and respected my property.

It has been about 3 months and I cannot be happier with the results.  I have a warranty for the termite work (comes automatically with the treatment) and the pest team comes out once a month to spray (better than the once a quarter off other companies).

So, the natural approach matched with great service makes me a very happy customer and compelled to share my experience.</text>

Nothing but Praise for these folks. The owners Son knows what he's doing and they did an excellent and FAST job at our house because we were on a deadline to refi. Guys were real professional and cleaned up everything after. Tent Monsters cannot compete with these guys. Tents use gas which kill the Exposed termites, Orange Oil is pressurized into the wood, framing and deep in the ground to wipe them all out, even the ones that sleep during the tenting.

<review>I tried to schedule their service and in the call I was persuaded to sign up for a monthly plan.  I gave them my credit information and he sent me the agreement to sign back.   Before I signed the agreement, I changed my mind after discussing with my wife.  I politely wrote back and said that I would like to cancel the service.  The guy replied that it is totally fine and promised not to charge my card.

Two months a roll they still charged my credit card.  I replied the email again to remind them to remove the autopay from my credit card.  I successfully disputed the two charges from credit card company.  They charged me again this month.  I called them 4 times and got referred here and there.  No one can help me to cancelling the autopay.   ....< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I have been very pleased with my service from this company.  I have a monthly service and I appreaciate knowing I have someone on my property each month to not only keep the little bugs away, but to also help ensure no new bugs start creeping in to my home.

I have had Jonathan the past comple of months and he is always patient with me (as I sometimes like to ask a lot of questions).

They use natural products, so I feel more safe with my pets roaming around the home.</review>

<Text>I am displeased with planet Orange. 1. by the end of the third week after service is done for pest you see spiders around. I do have to say that I've never had issues with ants or any other bugs. 2. since spiders are my biggest issue and phobia I decided to cancel services since their spray does not seem to resolve this issue. It has been a night mare. I have been over charged for the past 4 months and continue to be over charged even after I requested a cancellation and without services being rendered. I am trying to contact a manager but haven't had luck with this.
However, I give them two stars because the individuals who have come out to my home to do the treatment have all been here when they say they are. I have been home and they have not known I was home so I have seen them do the actual work and when I am not home I can smell that they have done the actual treatment.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808e34f9c91636e7:0x7fa34f285868b73f<//Gmap_id></record>

This is the worst company I have ever worked with. We called the contacts for a quote about 1 month trail and so trust them as the high yelp review however they just send a year-based-contract without letting us known. They came to visit and set some traps and caught the mice but when we request for the 2nd visit, they just come and inspect but never provide any solution to cut the source.

Then they just cold call us to see if they can visit again just on that day without scheduling time with us! man, how do they think everybody just wait at home for their call or visit! Who do they think they are.

Their service does not match the high price they asked! Do never choose it!<//review>

This location is across from the Costco. It’s big and it’s kept clean. Even the bathroom smells clean which is amazing.

The food is good and what you would expect from flame broiler. The portions are about right and the staff are friendly. Can’t really go wrong here.< /review>

No salads were available at time of visit so I order a chicken veggie bowl. Chicken was a little burnt but still edible. Also the air conditioner was either off or not working so it was hot in there.</Text>

<text>This place is horrible, I came in and first of all, no one in cashiers desk, I asked for well done, chicken and ( didn't get it), they gave me all the fat from the chicken, I wasn't sure it chicken or gum, couldn't even chew the chicken.

<review>I love this bldg and their friendly staff.

Going on four months in the bldg. My company is here trying out a remote pilot program for a year. So far it's been great for my compute. The bldg and its amenities are great. They got a small gym and game room with a few arcades and a basketball.

The area has lots of restaurants and some bldg are under construction. Hopefully this will make downtown more attractive....

Pics are my view from the seventh floor on a rainy day in March.< /review><username>Viola C.</username>< time>

What a great idea!  It's like renting an office in a big company.

Your private office costs from $600 to $4000 depending on how many people are using it.  The place was modern feeling and some of the rooms especially against the exterior window looked great!

All the offices are divided by windows and there're plenty of community spaces to interact with others to feel like you're not alone.  It also serves as a gym, in that you see others working hard everywhere so it'll keep you motivated and going.

It's in the middle of San Jose downtown so you can walk to San Pedro Square and there are plenty of choices to eat or drink downstairs, but it also comes with a lot of homeless people in the area.  Parking structures next to it was reasonable at $5-6/day.

They really used up every space they could to rent out with thin claustrophobia unfriendly hallways.< /Review>

I hosted a small conference here with some of my employees, customers, and vendors and it went really well. I will use again next time I need to have a professional office setting.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5NaiIJmP_mrP8JsCpoS9VOaDk0olbyNNh0gxm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-Ccktn5tovb2WpkHp_qSxQGqFSGxFZRN59Zzg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPQ66QQIII2f60HwfSjX1JYUYuEWcvOWQmIiGr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fccbd27481ecf:0xc69af5b8a869f396<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice co-working space with decent pricing all things considered. Plenty of room to work, offices to rent for more serious businesses, meeting rooms to book, free coffee and beverages on tap, free mouthwash in the bathroom to get rid of coffee breath... And most importantly, fast reliable internet.
So far the 9th floor is my favorite but 5th floor is the Obie.ai California HQ. Go visit for free cute beaver stickers.</review>

<Review>I knocked off 1 * for the lack of parking. It's really. Difficult to work and wework locations because they never have parking anywhere. Except for the Palo Alto 1... Most of the wework San Mateo, San Francisco downtown, as well as San Jose, have zero parking. Unless you're willing to pay a monthly fee at.  A location This makes it very difficult for anyone Working there who just wants to be mobile and I work both in Los Angeles and San Francisco and it's very difficult for me to use wework. Because there's never any parking. It causes a lot of unnecessary stress during my day. thinking of going back to Spaces because at least there's parking everywhere and spaces. :-( I do like the convenience of wework. But I am stressed out about the parking.< /Review>< Pictures>

The renovations have been really nice.  The game room/patio area is really nice to have. Especially as someone who doesn't work for WeWork I think its cool that they allow us in there.  It's a little frustrating how often people get on the elevator to go one floor when there is easy access to stairs.< /Review>

Plenty of space and lots of light filtering in the rooms (which is helpful for someone who had trouble waking up in the morning). Meeting rooms of every size are available (1-person for phone calls or your entire team can comfortably settle down).</Text>

My favorite WeWork location!! I’ve gone to a few and this team made me feel right at home. If you ever need anything, feel comfortable going up to the lady at the front desk, Dana. I couldn’t connect to the TV and she was so willing to help me out and provide an HDMI cord. Great service!</Text>

First time to a WeWork location and liked it very much. I was stranded at SJC for an entire day, needed a place to work and to charge my laptop. The front desk not only gave me a free trial pass but also let me use a charger. Such a nice staff, supporting non-profits and minority people from all walks of life. Thank you!!</Text>

When I was viewing the space and picking up the initial paperwork I was clear that I only needed a desk for one month. Move in was Jan 3rd and I again notified them on the 9th. The main area had around 40 desks, and only 6 of them had occupants but I was told that I would have to pay for two full months because the policy is that cancellation needs to be made before the end of the previous to last month. That's impossible for a one month rental and I find this totally unacceptable since my cancellation wasn't blocking them from finding a new occupant ( there were 30+ open desks).</Review>

<Review>Great concept, but grossly overpriced for SMB's. Elevators are confusing big time. No privacy! All Glass walls.<//Review>< gmapID>

We tried to call the owner  many times direct with no return calls and called his office many times to have them do a design for our backyard. We went and visited today to pick out the plants ourselves and do the design. The owner was so rude to us and called us liars to our face. He did not want our business nor did his employees. He did not want our business by any means. I still am in shock.  I would recommend nobody to go there and will be telling people who ask me about my experience the same. Very disappointed.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

These guys are the best.  Enormous selection, wholesale prices, and personal service and advise.  They provided the plants and most materials, supplies, and mulch for my large landscape project, and since it has grown to become a beautiful property.  Thanks!<//Review>

Paradise Garden Center is just now finishing up my landscaping, as we removed grass and put in plants and a drip system so I have been working with them for several weeks.  They have several employees at the nursery who really know their plants, and are very helpful whether you are just there for a few things for your yard, or are ready for a total redo.  I'm also very impressed with their crew who are quick and efficient.

I can't say enough nice things about Christian, the owner.  He is a problem solver, excellent listener and gave me the garden and yard I wanted.  Thanks, Christian!</text>

<text>Hard working staff, they help you with choosing the right stuff for your garden projects. large yard lots different large trees, shrubs, succulents,roses , ground cover plants,vines , fruits,rocks,multch, soils etc ... Plenty more stuff and they also deliver if you wanna get alot of material, although a pick-up truck is fine since it's open to the public . They got machinery to load up trees so it's no problem if you wanna take a decent size tree.</text>< Pics>

These guys are a wreck. I called looking for a specific tree, which they reported to have. I drove across town to buy it, and was told that, no, the tree I wanted was at their other location on La Sierra, about a mile from where I was when I had called.

So I opened up Google Maps to look for the location on La Sierra, but it doesn't exist on the map. So I went back in to get directions/ address, and they pulled out a handy, pre-printed, laminated map to look at, which they easily could have given me at first. After studying the map, I observed that the La Sierra location is not in fact on La Sierra, but is instead on Campbell. Which they didn't tell me.

So I programmed in the address, and crossed town again, only to find a locked gate and no one around. The place looked closed. After wandering around for 20 minutes, and figuring out that the gate was not actually locked, I found a worker, who informed me that the tree I wanted was at ANOTHER location over off of a different street (Norwood). So I followed him on a quarter-mile walk to the other site, where he escorted me to the tree I had requested... only to find that it was a DWARF version of the tree. They had no standard-size trees in the variety that I had requested.

So after driving across town twice, and wasting 2 hours trying to get what I wanted, they didn't have the thing they told me that they had.

The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because the worker who helped me locate the (wrong) tree was helpful and sympathetic, noting that the guys at the Dufferin location often misstate their stock, don't verify availability, and don't give clear directions to customers. So while it didn't help me at all, at least he understood my situation.

This could all have been avoided with some very minimal customer service effort on their part, saving me hours of wasted time, and a lot of driving. But they don't seem to really care about their customers, so I won't be back. I recommend to you that if you want something from them, be very specific with them about exactly what it is that you want, and make sure you ask where you should expect to find it. Otherwise you may end up on the same wild goose chase that I experienced.

Consider yourself warned.</text>

<pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><review>Melissa at the South Coast location gave me an exceptional hair styling, in fact the best I ever had.  I’m very particular about my hair and she not only cut it perfectly symmetrical but gave me a few suggestions how to tweak it to maximize the overall effect.  Back in the day, I’ve had my hair styled by Jose Eber, Jay Sebring and Vidal Sassoon but Melissa is by far the best! I’m fortunate to have her cut my hair. Her venue is modern and extremely clean and tidy with perfect music. You can have a beer, iced coffee or Perrier on the house plus I got a free coffee mug which I proudly use every morning before work. They offer a t-shirt with their logo to wear while getting groomed so you don’t wrinkle or get your shirt wet. Well worth the money if you’re at all concerned about your appearance!

<Time>1605131443889</Time><rate>1<//rate><review>Went here in a pinch as my normal stylist was booked up. So, if you need a cut and can't wait, do yourself a favor; save the $60 and find a blind dude in an alley. You'll likely get a better cut that way. One side of my head shaved down while the other side is bushy. Back left side was half an inch longer than the right. Now have to go to my normal stylist and pay another $60 to unscrew what was done. What a waste.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dcde4f9b871571:0x872d7809510c86f3</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I haven't had a hair cut in 11 months due to the COVID pandemic and my hair was very long.  I never had long hair before and I wanted to see what I could do with it so I didn't want to get a regular haircut.

I stopped by here for the first time.  I felt very comfortable with their COVID protocols.

Rachel was my stylist and she took the time to slowly cut my hair and explain how I can style my hair - which was very helpful for me because I was clueless.< /Text>< Pics>

They specialize in men's hair but I feel like they dont listen to what men want. I bought the 3 for the price of 2 and both times my hair was cut not the way I wanted it. I do appreciate the shirts to change into so that you dont get your suit or uniform full of hair. They present you with an aroma to start which is relaxing and then a quick head rub which could be good if they put effort into the massage. I understand they arent massage therapists so im not going to fret about that. They offer free water, redbull, and beer upon arrival.  I dont drink but for those that do, it can be a great thing for the afternoon or to wind down at the end of the work day.</review>

I've never had a barber I've been loyal to until now. Not only because they're amazing at cutting hair but everyone is SO accommodating to my two year old. He gets his hair cut there and loves it. The area is also perfect to hang out after or before. Overall, amazing people and haircuts.<//text>

Awesome people here, great for modern men’s haircuts. My stylist Stephanie was incredibly attentive to what I wanted, gave me great tips on styling, and my haircut came out exactly how I imagined. If I lived in this area, this would be my new spot, no question.</Review>

<Text>This 5 star review is solely for Jess. She gave me the very best experience I have ever had in a Hair salon ever . I walked in and was nearly turned away by the person who greeted me because I didn't know this was an appointment based salon , this didn't bother me too much , but Jess took it upon herself to stop me from leaving and to make sure I was taken care of before my flight . She is fun and happy, and not at all about just getting your money . This is a PROFESSIONAL . Remarkable at that , we had conversation the entire time, where I was comforted and made feel like Family to be completely honest . At this point , I don't even care what my hair looks like because she has just gone above and beyond with the Customer service Already! But damn , I look good , lol . Also got a new way to Part my hair that I never tried before . This is all leading up to an even GREATER GESTURE .... this saint of a person just COVERED my costs and told me to have a great flight , and let me tell you ... this made my day . Wow she deserves any Raise or promotion that will come her way , and with this type of professionalism and heart , she will be going places . I hope the very best for your Daughter , and for you of course , and for your Family . Jess I would be so proud of my daughter if she grew into the wonderful person that you are . I live 50 min away , but I will be back for my next Haircut and hopefully all of the future ones as well . Thank you so so much.

Pricey but they do a good job. Free beer or red bull. You get to change into a vneck shirt to not get hair on your clothes.  Same parking lot as an awesome outdoor food court with a bar for before or after your haircut.< /text>

Melissa is a perfectionist and she cut my hair took the time to really style it and perfect the cut. She even gave me instructions on how to style it and offered a beer. It was more like visiting a friend and getting a great hair cut with that visit.
Will be going back again for sure.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Disappointing. So I had my haircut with Bita today and long story short there was some misunderstanding of how I wanted my haircut and I ended up with a different cut. I told her To just finish up the blend because I had somewhere to be and the cut was already nearing the hour mark. I checked it out in the store and thought it look good. Even tipped the stylist. Got home and realized that this is the worst haircut I’ve ever gotten. The back is uneven there is 0 blending on the sides. Horrible  haircut. I used to get my haircut by Jess and never had an issue. Waste of money, never coming back.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1547347507559, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave us the kind words :)'}< /Resp>< gmapID>

Wow. Such a great experience coming to this Salon. They are very professional, experienced and it's a top notch place. What I like the most is how they cater to men. They give you a shirt, wash your hair first, head massage, etc. They are all about the experience.</text>

I like how they look to attend quickly as possible so it’s stress free. They are very polite and help customers by bringing purchases straight to the car so they make it a breeze and the entire experience is a really positive one. This is a great establishment and I definitely recommend it.<//review><date>1558971825439</date><GmapID>0x80c331f5f3d8c7eb:0x6921e32903183207<//GmapID><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

Customer service is great it's really clean and the fruits and vegetables are always fresh.. Only thing is when you do an online order which is supposed to be done when you get there it's never ready they wait until you come to do it SO WHATS THE POINT OF A ONLINE order?<//review>

Everybody was very kind and helpful. I'm terrified of dentist and made a scary procedure more doable. Staff was great. Making payment arrangements was easy. There was a little wait but they made up for it in other ways. Recovering from oral surgery and doing well. Very grateful ☺️</Text>

The waiting experience was terrible! I had an appointment was at 10 AM and I left canceling the visit at 11:10 AM. No link was sent to upload any documents and that was given as a reason. The treatment by the receptionist was also not good. When I mentioned about my appointment time to the receptionist, she said “10 AM appointment doesn’t mean you go in at 10. Waiting time can be anything!”.

Definitely don’t recommend this place!< /Text>

<Review>This place is crazy.... First they couldn't find my insurance, then they charged me for treatment AND bill my insurance to double dip, and then they tried to sell me services I don't need.  They're extremely un organized.  Every time to call them, they don't know who you are or why you're calling... AND most of the time, you'll be transferred to their national call center and then back... I'd spend your $$ somewhere else where you get better service and won't scam the insurance industry.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Have been here three times with kids. The waiting time is horrible, all three times with appointment. You wait in lobby, then they are waiting in doctors chair. Then you wait in between of two "back to back" (as they call, but in fact it's not) appointment of your kids. Why do you need to wait? It took 1.20min in chair to put a two side filling for 6 y.o who is cooperating. Why? I doubt that a doctor was talking care of her only. Looks like they have three patients for one doctor at a time!
Go there only if you have no alternative  and reserve at least half of your day for it</Review>< gmapID>

Worst place to go! Do not come here for anything. The staff is completely rude. Dr.Sawers threw his hand at me and acted in a violent manner. The manager of this office does not know what he's doing and lets his employees watch patients during treatments, as in the front desk receptionists. Very unprofessional.<//text>

<UserId.>112931259771610863194</UserId.><text>The worst dentistry I have ever been to. I went in September 2020, mainly because I wanted to get my wisdom teeth removed. They told me that for me to get the surgery, I would need to get acceptance from my insurance ( medical). Western dental themselves said to me that they would put in the request and that they would contact me when they had an update. Four months go by no contact. so I decided to contact Western dental  1/14/2020. The receptionist told me that my request had been denied. Of course I make sure to contact my medical services and they were quick to let me know that my services were still up and running. The receptionist even told me that she would try to put in a second request for my surgery. LIES. according to my insurance they didn’t even request the first one. i’ll be sure to mention this to anyone I know who plans on making an appointment. you guys don’t care about your patients.<//text>< Resp>

Bad service had an appointment at 11:30 and had to reschedule since I was waiting for 3hours. High prices for bad service and outdated instruments. I wouldn’t recommend it to no one.< /text>

< Review>
Dont go here. Worst experience ever. If you book at 9 dont  expect to go in for another 1 to 2 hours. They over book. They suck thats why my other dentist did not give referalls to Western Dental, especially this one.<//Review>

Receptionist is rude and incompetent. The dentist themselves are nice people but they have scheduling issues so don't expect your appointment to be honored. Came on time for an appointment, was told that there would be 40 minute wait time and they might not be able to treat me?

I asked to for other dates but were booked up, when I gave my scheduling needs receptionist kept giving times that where not within the times I would be available and as I had already stated?  After frustrating going back on forth I gave up. After checking if my other plans could be  pushed back I called back saying I could wait, (11 mins after the conversation) They said would not take me even though the wait time was more?  Aaaand they would not see me until the next month.

Not coming back..<//Text>

<Text>This is not a good dentist I was having tooth pain and made my first appointment and I have 3 dental insurance and on my first appointment which I had to take the day of work, I came in they could not see me because they needed to verify all them and it could take a whole day. So I rescheduled my appointment and again on my second appointment they said the same that my 3 insurance types needed to be verified and I could not been seen. They have no respect for their patients time and that people are taking days off of work and being told they can’t be seen when you have 3 different insurance. So horrible.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I called to make an appointment five times. They gave me dates to come in and i would call the day before to make sure my appointment is actually happening and then the 24 hour care person says this location is closed.  FIVE TIMES THIS HAPPENED that they scheduled a time for me to come in and then the location is closed.. Not to mention i have to spend an hour on hold just trying to make an appointment for braces tightening and just trying to confirm the appointment/schedule a new one as the online appointments are not available. NOT a happy customer.</Review>< Pics>

You have to schedule a month ahead of time because they only have availability a month from whenever you’re making an appointment. I made an appointment ON THEIR WEBSITE and they waited tul the day i walked to tell me that the time I chose was too late because the doctors are leaving by then. They said they tried calling my emergency contact and said that was the only number they had, which is a lie because I put all my contact information in the application PRIOR to the month long wait. And guess when they rescheduled my appointment to. A MONTH FROM NOW🙂<//Text>

I had a dental appointment on 10/27/20 at 11:00am.  I arrived early and was told their computer system was down and I would probably not be seen since I was a new client.  They didn't seem to care that I took a day off from work and I needed to see a dentist urgently for a cracked and infected tooth.  Since I was a former client at the Santa Clara office, they told me to go back there.  I told them I made this appointment in Redwood City because the Santa Clara office didn't have  any openings until 11/18/20.  I've decided to go elsewhere for my dental work after the poor treatment and uncaring attitude of the staff at the Redwood City office.  I was very dissatisfied by the Redwood City Western Dental Center...they should have texted me or called me so I didn't waste my time driving to their office...they don't care...😐</text>

Love the service at this office, but I'm hating the fact that no matter how long I wait, they still have yet to call me to schedule my wisdom tooth surgery. When I call the customer care line to be transferred to this office, I never get a person who can help me schedule this appointment. I'm genuinely sick of this runaround</Text>

If I could put Zero stars, I would... I had one of the worst experiences of my life going to this dentist office. Dr. James Wun was extremely rude & unprofessional to me and his co workers. He made me feel uncomfortable during the entire time he was working on me since he seemed very frustrated. He stopped the procedure without even finishing. The rest of the staff was nice enough to finish the procedure for me before they sent me home.< /Review>

This was absolutely the worst experience I have ever had. I took time off of work twice for them to tell me I couldn't be seen even with an appointment. Then they tell me its corporates fault that I was scheduled during those times. Then I get guaranteed to be seen by the supervisor who confirmed with the manager the next day at 11. I waited over 2 hours to be seen even with this guarantee. Then they tell me I needed 4 fillings. The girl tells me to make an appointment again for that. I was in pain with a broken tooth. I was in tears. Then the dentist says no we will see her today. No good communication. Then the dentist starts numbing the wrong side of my face because the last filling I had wasn't documented by them. I had to stop him to tell him that. He even said they didn't document it. What?! I asked for my records to get seen somewhere else after that. By far awful. Customer service was so poor by far. Scary experience I will NEVER come here again.</text>

I don's usually like to rate this low. They really need to train their staffs well, one of the staff hang off my phone on me without finish my question. This is very rude to the patient! And  it didn't make a smile! except I got mad at it!  They are many times I called them and they are not so professional at all. I can't believe how this dental be alive so long.  They also let us waited so long no matter if we got there early or late. They also need to do their time management well.< /text>

<Review>Usually not the type to write a negative review, in fact I cannot remember ever posting a negative review. As someone who knows a lot of physicians, and administration in the medical community (family, friends, clients) & have visited hundreds of medical facilities in various parts of the country. I want to say this is one of the worst I have experienced in terms of professionalism, hygiene, organization, and overall experience. Disappointed, a waste of 2.5 hours of my time and was told "x" over the phone and the experience was completely different. After verifying with insurance I was in fact told incorrect information regarding pricing for services. I would avoid this unless it is your only option.<//Review>< Pictures>

I'm not use to being 'double-booked' for an appointment to see any dentist, but this office does well with their patients.  What I see is a very fast environment and a smooth one at that.  I see a well maintained office with employees who get along doing their job well.  Because its such a busy office that deal with quite a few patients at one time the wait calls can be a bit nervy.  But over-all its a good place to get your teeth done at a better price than most other places.< /Review>

Dr Gomez and staff are very kind
Jon who brings you in for xrays is a very kind man who listens very well to what's going on with your mouth. He asked very good questions and not only listened very well but took extra time to document what I was saying.
Dr Gomez has a very kind heart for all his patients.  He really cares about each one individually. If he ever leaves western dental id follow his practice. It means alot to see a doctor really care about people in their line of work and not just do it for the paycheck. I appreciate
Every one who went out of their way to be kind to me and concerned.<//text>

<Review>It’s convenient and local, very clean location.  However the procedural process is to long.  Went in @11:00 for X-rays and overall consulting and left at 2:00.  It was 2:00 and they still needed to do a deep cleaning.  Not acceptable to me!<//Review>< Name>

Went for a first appointment, showed up 15 min early... filled out my paper work and waited for a full hour before they told me it would be ANOTHER hour before I'd be seen, at least. They suggested I should reschedule for a different day. What? Totally unprofessional practice to accept my appointment and waste my time waiting when it's very clear they didn't have time for me. I really would recommend you go anywhere else before going here, especially because it also has the look and feel of a 30+ year old strip mall. I don't get the impression that working there would be anyone's first choice, so I almost can't blame them for providing such poor service.< /review>

Everyone was really sweet.  The front staff was very polite and helpful.  The radiology guy was really sweet, very very fast, and  a talented rad tech.  The finance person was funny, charming, and really helped.  I do, however feel like I was being pushed into a lot of things I couldn’t afford.<//Review>

I made a appointment for my son last week. I have to say I will definitely becoming back. My son had a cleaning and also had fillings done same day. I can't complain over all experience was great. Since the moment I walked in front staff was great. My son is a handful, but the front staff gave my son a coloring book as we waited in the to be called. We didn't wait long to be honest. The doctor was great as well and didn't get the assistant name but the staff was great. Thanks guys, you guys are awesome.</Text>

< Review>
The orthodontist has grey customer service but the general dentist is the complete opposite. Showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early, waited 30 minutes to be seated in the treatment room. Waited more then an hour for someone to tell us anything. When we asked what was the procedure/ why was it taking long the worker sighed and walked away and complained to the other workers about US. But that was the first time we directed words to each since we have been seated. Then the doctor started complaining out loud about how much work he had todo which made me and I’m pretty sure everyone else uncomfortable because it seemed like he was careless. When we asked him he told us, “ listen I havnt even been on my lunch, I’m the only one here if you want then reschedule.” We said no we can’t reschedule we’ve been waiting for about 2 hours. He then responded with okay then be patient. Totally unprofessional.<//Review>

I had a poor experience! I showed up to my appointment on time and waited close to two hours and was NOT seen. I eventually told front desk staff I had waited for too long and would be taking off. At some point, during my wait, the young female front desk representative while assisting a client with what looked to be x-ray copies (pictures), was having a side conversation with another female front desk representative about how she was sick of dealing with some client. I must say this is unprofessional as you should for one avoid having side conversations when you have a client right in front of you, specially when it has to do with another client! I can't recall this gal's name or I would have shared it.< /text>

Terrible place! I was there from 11 am to 3 pm only to get X-rays because the cleaning would take about one hour and thirty minutes more of waiting time. Also, the equipment seems very old and the  rooms are so tiny you don't even have space for your purse.< /review>

<text>Literally some of the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced, they can never answer the phone and don’t seem to realize it’s not ok to waste hours of people’s time. I left work early to go there and they had told me prior to my appointment that my insurance was approved only to get there and be told it wasn’t for some reason nobody could explain. I booked another appointment weeks later and they assured me they would take care of everything on there end and let me know before my appointment that everything was good and approved and that I could be seen which they havnt done. Now I can’t get ahold of anyone in the office after calling 6 times and getting redirected to their customer service which I think is in India...< /text>< Pictures>

I had a very positive experience at Western Dental in Redwood City. After a short wait, I was called to have x-rays taken, which were done very competently by Manuel Cervantes. This was followed by a consultation with Dr. Roza, who went out of her way to fit me into her busy schedule so that I could have fillings done on the same day as my teeth cleaning appointment. She and her dental assistant, Marisela Lupa, made me feel relaxed and comfortable during the procedure, and I was very pleased with the results. My visit concluded with my teeth cleaned by Manuel Cervantes, and I left Western Dental with a smile on my face.<//review>

I had been on hold with them for over 20 minutes so I finally hung up and called again only to have someone answer the phone and immediately hang up. I then tried calling again to finally have a human being answer only to tell me there were 5 patients ahead of me and that I would be placed on hold.  Extremely unprofessional</text>

Consistently the WORST dental facility I've ever been to.  Terrible customer service, awful cleaning techniques, unwarranted procedures.  Avoid if you have any sense and pay the extra 100 bucks for someone who can do a good job.  And worst of all the whole place seems to be run by Zombies....nobody gives a damn about anything in there.< /Text>

< Review>
I went for months to get them to correct my dentures, which they had made and did not fit and still do not fit.  The  last time I went  they got angry with me and told me not to come back.  The truth is that they were not willing to  correct matters.
I could not recommend them to any one  for any kind of dental work.  I too agree the place in Redding Ca. is no very clean.< /Review>

<Text>I have been to this location with my daughter several times and it was always a pleasant experience. The front desk and dental assistants are super nice. Dr. Puri however, made us never want to come back. She didn’t greet us at the time of the consultation or say anything to my daughter and I about her teeth or X-rays. All she did was send someone over to do a cleaning. She had a horrible attitude and treated the staff in a rude and unprofessional manner. When I asked to speak with Dr. Puri she walked up to me rolling her eyes and seemed very agitated. I was in shock to see the way she interacted with her patients. I also feel really bad for the staff who have to work with such an unpleasant woman. We will not be returning to this location.</Text>< Pictures>

This Western Dental deserves more than 5 stars ! I had a crown that fell out in the front I was toothless and left embarrassed, When I came here in the time of need JULIO helped me and ensured me I was going to be taken care of . By the grace of god Julio was there and the nice young lady to restore my missing tooth . They are both angels in disguise and everybody should come here . 10 Stars Thank You Western Dental Redwood City< /text>

However they were SUPER fast to get me to pay for everything.
I guess that is all they really care about her.

RUDE service. Tried to take advantage of my retired parents!

My parents made an appointment Monday. Came in and they only took an xray, then the staff said they were closing early and asked them to come back Thursday. My parent came again Thursday. After waiting for a long time. They said they would only do a deep cleaning for an additional $1500.

My mom asked them why weren't they informed earlier. They were not prepared to pay that much. She asked if they could only do the clean or reffer them somewhere else.

They said no and asked them to leave. They even said they would call the cops at some point.<//review>

They refused to get me in for an emergency visit for over a week, and so I had to go see another dentist for an emergency root canal. They also caused a cavity in the adjacent tooth. After that experience, I canceled my contract with them as a result and  filed a complaint with the Dental Board of California for malpractice.

Next they kept sending me bills for my contract, bills, late fees, interest. They continued to auto-debit my card for Services NOT RENDERED> they now owe me over $200.00.I would call and call and call and be on hold for hours at a time just to tell them I had canceled my contract and they reassured me it was canceled. Finally today, April (5 months later), I called again after receiving another bill. The supervisor told me I had to go in to the Redwood city office in person to cancel my contract. No if's and's or but's. This is ludicrous. The pain, suffering, frustration, this whole experience has been a nightmare. Never go to WESTERN DENTAL. I have filed a BBB complaint as well, and will go to every site I can find to warn people against them.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1524595193033, 'text': 'Lacey Greene Thank you for taking some time to express your concerns.

The staff is really rude I had an appointment and waited over an hour in the dental chair. The assistant told me they were under staffed. One of the ladies in the front is very impatient and very rude if you ask how much longer it is after you been waiting 30 minutes after your scheduled time. They pulled my wisdom teeth and after they healed they have pieces of gum lifted and flapping around. They gave me an Amalgam filling as well and it's 5 months later and it's so sensitive to cold and feels like it might fall out as well as being jagged. And since when does it take 4 minutes to do a full teeth cleaning I gave them 3 chances and I'll never go back I would never recommend this place to anyone unless you want to be severely uncomfortable after procedure and get treated like crap by the staff.

People were polite but the doctor told me that I needed to have five root canals which I clearly do not and then the receptionist asked how I wanted to pay up front when I said that I was not having them< /review>

Western Dental is one of the filthiest dental facilities ever!!!  I would not recommend you even take your animal into this place for dental care.
Their equipment is outdated, staff are rude, are clueless to HIPAA regulations, and over-book which in turn means you're stuck waiting to be seen over an hour after your scheduled time.  They have no respect for patient's time.

They treat their patients like cattle, their front office/reception area alone says it all.  Unclean floor, rows of outdated chairs and I don't even want to tell you how dirty their bathroom is!  Seriously, I just don't understand how insurance companies allow for such a facility to be a network provider or why they would even want to contract with such a filthy establishment.

Shame on Delta Dental for referring members to such a filthy office for dental care!!!<//text>

Filthiest and the most unprofessional dental clinic I have ever been too. X-ray tech did my hygiene and cleaning, go figure. Half of their equipments were not working. No sense of privacy, all patient chairs are right next to one another. Void this place.</review>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service enters the patients and makes them wait more than half an hour inside without being attended for 2 hours just for a filling. Terrible service and it is the second time that it happens with my son, I definitely will not return, I will look for a new dentist for my children since they do not respect the schedules but if you must respect and arrive on time because if you arrive a little late they no longer want to attend.

(Original)
Pesimo servicio entran a los pacientes y los hacen esperar mas de media hora adentro sin ser atendidos 2 horas solo para un relleno. Pesimo servicio y es segunda vez que pasa con mo hijo definitivamente no regreso, buscare un nuevo dentista para mis hijos ya que ellos no respetan los horarios pero si debenis de respetar y llegar a tiempo por que si llegas un poco tarde ya no quieren atender.< /review>

(Translated by Google) They say they accept medical but apparently only for cleanings because I have to do a canal routine and they say they don't do it, they told me to go to another dentist. But in general the service is very good, I liked it, it only made me sad that detail that they do not do, even with full coverage.

(Original)
Dicen que haceptan medical pero al parecer solo para limpiezas porque yo tengo que hecer un rutcanal y dice que eso no lo hacen me dijeron fuera a otro dentista.

one of the best stores in madera , highly recommend them I was able to switch from T-Mobile to Cricket  and get everything done less than 30 mnts , phone accessories are were on sale I got them for $20 and sure they know how to treat a customer I will send friends and family their way !!!

Thank you :) Best customer service I ever received in a cellphone store</review>

<Text>This locations closes at 8pm as it states in their business hours. I arraived there at 7:30 to buy a phone only to see the workers already closing up the gates. I really needed a phone and was disappointed by the misleading business hours. When i asked why they were closing early the employee replied it was Saturday and there were parties to go to. This is unacceptable and hope the store manager can deal with this.<//Text>< Time>

<Text>Have been going to this Menchies since it opened. Quality of the yogurt has severely gone downhill the last few months. Yogurt on several occasions has been either runny or icy. And to make matters worse the staff has followed the yogurt going downhill. Machines and store aren’t as clean anymore.

While my family and myself frequented Menchies about once week that will be no more. I have given them more than 3 strikes. Pinkberry and Yogurtland will have our business from now on.< /Text>< Time>

<Text>Santa Monica location is still my favorite after visiting a bunch throughout LA. Staff is friendly, accommodating and don't hide sample cups under the counter like some branches.

It was rich in flavor and just sweet enough; and the blueberries added a nice tartiness to the cake. I paired with an ice-cold Mexican Coke and it was the best dessert I had had in a while. My friends went for the ice-cream bars and they have some pretty delicious ones such as strawberry shortcake.

I wish I would've tried some of their food but alas I was only trying to satisfy my sweet tooth that day.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

There's a lot of hoopla surrounding this place. I have to agree with it. The items this place offers would be heaven for anyone with a sweet tooth. I had a Thai tea macaron ice cream sandwich and a walnut chocolate chip cookie. They have one of the best macarons I've ever had. I will definitely be coming back to try the billions of items they have.<//review>

<time>1546721482241< /time><text>I have to get my Menchie's fix every time I'm in Santa Monica!  I love the natural flavor - tastes like regular yogurt with a little sugar stirred in and frozen.  Seems pretty basic, but I like tart crisp flavors.  I live in Boston and everyone wants to sell heavily flavored and ridiculously sweet froyo here; the only place that serves natural flavor in Boston is Pinkberry's.

Anyway, I like the convenience of self-service.  Grab a container, select your flavor from the dozen available, dispense it, add as much or as little toppings as you want, then weigh it and pay.  If you're not sure, just grab a tiny sampling cup, and try as many free samples as you want.  Easy peasy.

The place is very kid friendly, and since it's self-service, there's no problem getting your youngster a squirt of 3-4-5 flavors if they can't narrow it down to two.

The only reason why I can't give this Menchie's a five-star rating is the cleanliness, and service, can be variable.  I have been there when the staff goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful and the place was spotless.  Other times, the table can be sticky and the servers seem to resent even weighing the product and taking your money., much less being courteous.  I don't mind, because I love natural flavor yogurt and the convenience of self-service.</text><Resp>None</Resp><user_name>Larry Stuart< /user_name><pics>None<//pics>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Menchie's, I wish you were a real person so I could hug you and thank you IRL.

Amazing quality product, wide flavor selection, fair prices, a stupendous array of toppings, and adorable branding. Everything I love about sweet treats in one place!

Here's what I love most about Menchie's on Montana:

- Cute, clean and bright environment
- Comfortable outdoor seating
- Daaaaaaank toppings station with luxurious ones like Nutella
- Kind customer service
- Happy spoons

Pro Tips:
- Sign up for their rewards program if you're a local!
- Ask them to bring out the Nutella bottle
- Ask for one of their cute stickers, no matter how old you are<//Review></record>

<Review>I defiantly do not recommend this place at all , they don’t care about your pet - family member. All they care about is their money and places like this will only try to take your money and will only try to put you in debt . They don’t understand that our pets, they are literally family to us and most of the time they are our best friends . Please don’t support this place and take your time find a vet clinic that actually cares and takes pride on their work and that actually cares about their animals .</Review>< pics>

<Text>I can’t review the quality of care given at this hospital because we received no care. I called about a feral cat with an abscess, said he’d need to be sedated for exam and likely needs some kind of surgical treatment. They said to come anytime as they don’t take appointments. I came, I waited. When dropping him off, I was told he would likely need sedated and I said I understood that, asked if I could go home as I live far and it’d be a while. They said yes as he likely wouldn’t have his procedure for a day or 2. Within 30 mins I got a call from a very nice Dr who told me they couldn’t do anything for the cat for at least a week but that he needs treated sooner than that. They said they schedule any sedation or anesthesia ahead. So why have me drive down here, wait to drop off and wait a ridiculous amount of time just to pick him back up? Other hospitals were able to tell me they wouldn’t be able to do anything for him if he needs sedation. This place wasted hours of my time, the cats time, not to mention the poor cat’s stress.</Text>< Pics>

This is our go-to place for the care of our fur-babies.  This has also been the place we go to when we have to say goodbye to them.
In April of 2016 we had to put our beloved River to sleep. Regretfully, we had to put our sweet Kitty to sleep on September 5th.
The amazing compassionate manner of the doctors and staff have always been great in these very difficult times. I was especially pleased with Dr. Sanchez as she thoroughly explained our options.  They are a very busy clinic and yet she took the time to explain, empathize, and console us during this difficult time.
They also offered us the opportunity to purchase cremation services and paw prints of our pets.
We recommend them to everyone we know.
Thank you for being so great!< /text>

The love and concern this facility had for our cat was absolutely appreciated. Although we are low on funds they did all they could to help our girl.  They fixed her all by prescribing the correct meds for her. Our kitty is back to her normal self 🐈💛<//review>

My cats were “fixed” here, given care when one had a high running fever. Years later one of them was dying and needed to be put down.

<Review>They're great. They accept walk-ins and I was able to get my kitten a checkup and vaccines fairly quickly. They are AAHA accredited so they have standards to uphold. I have taken two of my dogs and two cats here. They were treated promptly and with care. They are a full service animal hospital so they are able to take care of anything your pet may need. I would highly recommend them.</Review>< Pics>

<review>March 2nd had to put our loving pet (Jazz) of 11 years to rest. Even though we didn't use this facility for that service, a week later we got a call from Dr. Mark Milo giving his condolences and reinsurance that we did what was best for Jazz. So know that even though we can't take our pets inside they are in the hands of someone who truly cares<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>This is the first time that I've been here and for sure this is my baby's new vet! The vet techs were so patient with my dog and sweet to her, due to her being a rescue and not being too socialized and nervous.The vet sounded super caring and answered all of my questions. They seem reasonably priced for sure. So far, they are awesome!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dd280a38a20099:0x4a2b9c45fd2fcffd<//GmapID></record>

<Text>I expected an expensive visit with long wait time.   Luckily since it was my first time the exam fee was waived.  The medication and dog food was very affordable and most important the service  was exceptional.   You check in by calling once you arrive to the parking lot, they call you once they are ready to come and get your pet.< /Text>< name>

<Time>1619218710116< /Time><Rating>1</Rating><text>About sometime in July of 2019, I found a stray kitten off the streets and adopted him. I needed to get him dewormed, flea medicine, shots, and FeLV test. I decided to to take him  here for the FeLV test since it was the closest place nearby that offered it.
They charged me like $330 for the FeLV test, didn't give me any paperwork, then rushed me out as quickly as possible. Didn't leave a review back then, but will now.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Dogs are like 2 or 3 year old babies, I wouldnt drop of my baby at a curb to some strangers and im not going to drop off my 100lb pit bull here either. Shame on any of you who would do this with your baby.  What kind of parents are you? I have been going here for over 10 years. What a slap in the face. Drop your baby off at the curb!  What kind of people do this?</Text>< pics>

Was there all day just to be sent home with antibiotics. I couldn’t afford the $800 bill to drain the abscess on my cats foot! Poor guy has been a trooper, just happy to see him back to the  “Mouser” he was.< /Review>

<Review>Took my fur baby here for the first time as walk in on a saturday due to a little emergency, and the wait was well worth it. Only waited around an hour to get him in and he was good to go in  less than an hour.
The vet was so kind and although we cannot see face to face, I could hear that she cared about my concerns and was very attentive and explained/answered all my questions. Not sure how anyone would have given this place under 5 stars, I could cry with how perfect everything went considering how stressed I was trying to find a vet appointment for the same day. Pricing was great also compared to the 10 other places i called.

definitely returning, and would recommend them to anyone with a fur baby.< /Review>< Pictures>

Very effective vet
Thank you for trying to help my dog..your referral to VSS was appreciated...Garden Grove think about being able to actually visit with vet outside .. Of course.  The Surgery Center makes you feel better being able to see face to face the doctor after initial exam..<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Amazing! Had to take my little guy in this morning around 9 am after finding that his regular vet was closed ): the service was outstanding! Staff is quick and very thorough. Dr. Malo called in a timely matter after my dog was checked in. There were a lot of owners taking their pets in at the time, but my little guy was taken care of quickly nonetheless. VERY happy with our experience! Thank you Dr.Malo and your amazing staff! 😁<//Text>

They take a really long time. I was there at 7:30am when they opened and didn't start taking in pets until 9. I finally got my cat back at 11am. They had called me at 10 saying all they needed was to clip her nails and I waited an hour , so I called and was put on hold for 20 mins. They need a better system and appointments. Their prices are great, just wish it was organized.<//text>

We had our first visit/ consult for my Staffordshire today. Overall and so far, we're confidently  satisfied with our experience. For me, their system of registering, transparency in management plans with multiple discussions/conversations are excellent coupled with their clear discharge and follow ups plans, covid wise. Early tomorrow is our scheduled follow-up and labs results by phone discussion. Thank you Dr. BMH and staffs.</Review>

First time cat owner, first time taking him to the vet. Seriously could not recommend this place enough. Though the wait line can get long, the care and attention to detail from the staff is absolutely worth it.

Keep in mind though it is first come first serve so I recommend getting there early if possible. Bonus! The procedures and cost here is relatively lax compared to other vets around the area. Plus the staff is super friendly and helpful so that’s awesome

Overall, I give this place a 100/10. I will definitely be taking my cat here in the future for pretty much everything.<//text>

I've been going here for years with multiple pets and think highly of all the staff and facilities. They're friendly, affordable, and quick with their assessments and treatment. However, their procedures for operating during COVID is atrocious and unacceptable. On numerous visits I've been made to wait unnecessarily for 2-3 hours just to pay and check out my pets. All the other people in the parking lot waiting with me had the exact same experience.

As much as I love these folks, I can't recommend them until COVID is done and they resume normal operation. Looking forward to going back one day.</Text>

Zero care for animals. Horrible experience! Talk about lack of empathy for animals! I rescued a blind dog off the streets and brought him here in hopes to get him a quick examination and some much  needed help. They turned me away because they said they don’t see stray dogs. Only dogs with an established owner. I told them I would take ownership but they still rejected us. They told me to just take the poor dog the the pound. I would give them ZERO stars if I could.<//text>

This is a review for their covid procedures. You call and wait for them to call you. They’ll take your information and then call you when they’re ready to take in your dog, and you wait in your car until they’re done. You can pay thru your phone. It’s pretty easy but can have a significant wait depending on the time of day. The staff is very friendly. Decent prices. Walk ins only.
Ive only had one issue with them: they suggested and gave my dog more vaccines/shots than she needed one time. I don’t know if they looked at the wrong records but it worried me. Out of my many, many trips here that has been my only issue.<//text>

Great service and attention to my pet. They have perfected their service during this difficult time with the Corona issues and made going to the vet as painless and took the stress away for my dog. Their doctor was very thorough and easy to understand what was going on with my dog although i didn't get to talk to her face to face i still feel as if I got face to face service.<//Text>

I've been bringing my dogs here for over a decade. I now live 2 hours away yet I still bring my pets here. They have dealt with all my difficult farm dogs, my fosters and rescues. Great prices, great care. I won't go anywhere else. Edit: while I still love this place and understand it's crazy with COVID requirements, they need to warn you that you will be there for over 7 hours. Bring food, drinks, comfy car. There is a restroom across the street in Home Depot. I know they are doing their best but it was a horrendous day not being prepared for the wait.<//Review>

I took my dog for a dental cleaning and they extracted   16 teeth without my consent, she is only 5 or 6 years old, and this doctor just ruined her life, be careful and please don’t take your pet to this horrible hospital.</review>

Waste of time and money. On their website it states that they are committed to surgical procedures. After examining my kitty and doing the x rays, I was told that she was suffering from a broken bone, but that they were not equipped to handle her case. Waited 4 hours which was a waste of time and paid $300 in total. If your pet has an energency of such nature, please refer to a real hospital where they can help them. This is not a hospital, its a clinic that specializes in basic needs and they will only take your money but not provide you with the necessary services if they feel like they are not equipped.</Review>

I have been going to GG Dog & Cat Hospital, initially with my mom and dad, since I was 13 yrs old. I am now 62 years old. I know that all of my pets, past and present, always receive the absolute best care here. Dr. Mark Malo and Dr. Brent Hess are my favorites, however I assure you whichever Veterinarian sees your pet, your pet will receive the best care. During this unfortunate Pandemic that we are all trying to get through, you will experience a lengthy wait time. I promise you, the Doctors here are all worth the wait.< /Text>

My dog was in critical condition, relying on their oxygen machine to breath. He was was only there for maybe 2 hours before they needed to close. They knew the situation. The vet is the one who explained it to me. Regardless at 10 mins to closing (6pm) they made me transfer my baby to another facility.  I offered my entire savings ($54,832) for them to give him a couple more hours to allow the medicine to work before taking him off O2 machine. I was told "No, sorry I have to go." He basically charged me just over 2grand and then kicked him out. He did not make it 1.7 miles to the next place.< /Review>

My dog was having a seizure so I called from the parking lot and someone came right out and got him.  The vet called me within 20 minutes to go over causes and treatments.  He took his time with me and answered my questions and we agreed on a treatment plan together.   The next morning Dr Lindsey called and went over xray and blood results (which were all fine🤷‍♀️) and discussed next steps and medication.   My dog is older we also discussed quality of life and end of life care.  Dr Lindsey was very kind and compassionate in our conversation.   Expense wise, I don't have anything to compare thier services to.<//review>

I'm pleased at the outcome of services provided by Garden Grove Dog and Cat Hospital. Although going through hard times & requiring aid from a third party ie.. Pets of the Homeless, they didn't discriminate & provided service. Removal of a scary lump from from my little girl Braunti's thigh & relieving me of a tremendous amount of stress. Today now the day after surgery Braunti & I are making a speedy recovery. I thank the entire staff of Garden Grove Dog and Cat Hospital. God Bless All. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because of the seriousness they take in this "fake pandemic" (of which I can prove it is) causing a delay in pet services.<//text>

Cant wait for COVID to go away.</review>

<name>Melanie Cottle< /name><Text>Love this Vet office! The wait time is pretty long right now with the Covid-19 precautions (parking lot check in, etc.) But totally worth the wait! Everyone that I have interacted with has been so kind and gentle with me and my dog which I really appreciate. I have really bad anxiety and it's usually through the roof when it comes to stressful situations like worrying about my puppy. The staff all seem to go out of their way to make every stage of the vet visit a less stressful situation and I really appreciate that. So yeah, only downside that I have encountered is the wait times, and that really isn't their fault when it comes down to it. Just doing their best to keep us all safe.</Text><rate>4</rate>< UserId.>

It is not expensive at all. I took my dog to ABC animal hospital in cypress and  they changed me $789 and no call back with any results. They did the same thing here and the Dr. called me the next day with results. Here it only cost me $270. Garden Grove Dog and Cat hospital doesn't take advantage of people. The price is reasonable. They are the best. They were really loving with my dog.< /text>

<Review>I had a very pleasant experience with the staff and doctors. I took an outdoor neighborhood cat I help feed that was in bad shape. I answered their questions the best I could about the cat and they took really good care of him. I received updates from the doctor without me having to ask for them. I usually have to be the one calling in to get answers from other places I've been to. I got a piece of mind knowing the cat was taken care of and that the doctor cared for her patient. I wish I would have known about this place last year when one of me dogs needed a place like this one before she passed. I'm greatful I found GG dog and cat hospital and will continue to use their services for my pets. Pricing is very affordable and not overpriced like other places I've been to. Thank you Garden Grove Dog and Cat Hospital.</Review><user_id>100995975511285779442<//user_id>< GmapID>

Love, love, love the staff, doctors and vet techs at Garden Grove Dog and Cat Hospital. I cannot recommend this place enough. For any dog or cat issues they are able to get it figured out quickly and get your pets feeling better in no time. I wish I could give this place 100 Stars it is one of my favorite places to go whether for a nail trim or a medical issue for my dogs. Thank you Garden Grove Dog and Cat Hospital for all you do for our pets! WELL DONE!< /review>

<review>If I could give 10 stars, I would!  I booked the Royal Room (private room that looks just like a bedroom....made up bed and all for her to sleep on!!) for my pup and I could not be happier with the care she received.  I was able to send her pre-made meals that staff heated for her and they dispensed her medication according to instructions.  Staff is A+ all the way!!  I will absolutely be a frequent client as I know they'll take care of my fur baby as I would!!</review><response>None< /response>< Pics>

Called to get a quote on vaccines, I spoke with April who was very curt and unconcerned with my needs, she made that as apparent as possible. After the brief conversation with April, she abruptly hung up on my face. I am quite shocked with the experience, considering I am a returning customer who has never experienced such poor customer service.  However,  as many times as I have visited in the past and most recently,  due to today's poor customer service, I will be taking my business elsewhere. It is very important that we as customers are treated with respect, if it were not for us, this place would have no business!!!</text>

My dog has been going here since day 1. When I originally got my dog he was seen at VCA so I continued to go there. Right when my dog saw the vet he growled and barked. He hated them! With how high their prices were I decided to check out the humane society. Turns out they don't deal with epilepsy so they told me about this place. I've been going here for 8 years now. They care about your animal and not the money. Come here and you won't regret it.< /review>

They are overall pretty good. I've been taking my dogs there for a few years now. They do not accept appointments however, I've never waited longer then 20 minutes. My dogs seem to always walk in without hesitation (and, that means something👍)<//Text>

This place is the best! The staff is very helpful and provide excellent service. Danielle has been there forever and just love her. Dr. Hess & Dr. Mark (Malo) are FANTASTIC! They call you personally with test results/diagnoses/treatments etc.  & have been coming here for more than 25 years... Living in Orange,  Anaheim,  and now HB.  This is the only place I will bring Ozzie and any future pets🐶🐱< /review>

GG has taken care of my small zoo for the past decade with kindness, love, generosity and great care. The vets and staff are wonderful and their prices cannot be beat. I love the walk in (no appointments) set up they use- some days you might wait awhile to be seen if it's busy, but the convenience and safety of not having to wait days for your furbabies to be cared for can't  be beat.< /Review>

<review>Very trustworthy place. I have never had a bad experience here regarding care for my pets. Not have I seen anything untoward happen to anyone else there. The place is clean. My only complaints are that they can be busy at times and that they are not fast enough in pressing play on the DVD movies to watch while waiting.</review><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>A very busy veterinary office. They don’t make appointments so it’s a first come first served place. Waited about an hour the first time I went to take my dogs in. When I came back to pick them up after surgery there was a line but they pushed me to the front so that was helpful. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Just didn’t like the long wait time.< /Review><Date>1532617508271< /Date><user>117762320011584974129<//user></record>

This is the best place to bring your pet whether it's for maintenance or an illness, staff is caring and experienced. Competitive pricing, lots of parking and wheelchair accessible. Located right next to "Animal Inn" which also gets high ratings.<//review>

<Review>This place is always busy and waiting area and parking lot not very big. However staff and docs are very friendly and warm. Had to bring our old dog here on multiple occasions for variety of ailments. Prices are bit steep but no more than other vets in the general area and the care is great.  We finally had to put our old dog to sleep when it became obvious he was near the end. They were really compassionate and we appreciated that.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The staff here were amazing and so thoughtful and caring. Dr mark was unbelievably kind and assured us we were making the right choice for our handsome guy.

Thank you Garden Grove dog &cat hospital for all the love and care you showed us and our guy during our last moments together.</Text>< pics>

They have been taking care of our four legged furry kids for many, many years❣️ The Doctors are  wonderful & compassionate. We have had a couple close calls over the years with our little ones. The entire Staff is very caring. This is good to know. I have sent many friends to them. They all agree!< /review>

I have used Garden Grove Dog and Cat Hospital for over 30 years and will always take my cats there. Dr. Hess, Dr. Malo and the other vets are fantastic, caring and go the extra mile in animal care. I absolutely recommend this place for total cat and dog health care needs.</Review>

Doctor Todd took great care of our Barkley. He had a skin infection that was truly torturing him for a couple months. He got Barkley in a treatment that honestly started working in the first 24 hours. Many thanks to Doctor Todd. ❤🐶 look forward to his check up in 2 weeks.</review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I am forever grateful and thankful to Maria and the rest of the team at the Garden Grove Dog & Cat Hospital for helping my dog Jack today, and treating my pets over the last decade! From routinely rabies vaccinations, nail trims, to emergencies they have been there with a smile. I have always had reassurance that my babies would be ok - which is the best customer service any dog mom could want.

TODAY - My dog had his tooth completely out for an unknown cause & they took him immediately (even for going in at noon during lunch on a Friday) I was in with the half hour. He had anesthesia and had to have the tooth removed.
He is home and healing within the same day!< /Review>< pictures>

<text>They helped our little dog Eureka, she had an accident in the tub while getting a bath.  Her little foot got stuck in the drain, and not noticing, when I picked her up briskly, tore cartilage in her hip.  With the expertise of Dr. Hess, diagnosed what happened and the medication he prescribed, helped our Eureka to make a full recovery.  The staff was very helpful and courteous.</text><Rating>5</Rating><gmap_id>0x80dd280a38a20099:0x4a2b9c45fd2fcffd</gmap_id>< resp>

Excellent staff, they can be really busy and it is first come first served, but they have a lot if staff doing their best.  Not cheap, but not the most expensive animal hospital I have encountered.  They stick to their estimate even if your animal ends up needing a few extras.</review>

I have always received exceptional service by both the staff & all the doctors. The doctors truly care about the animals & are understanding when it comes to the high cost that can be associated with some of the care. Although they don't accept appts & can be very busy at times, the staff always do their best to be as professional & courteous as possible & it goes a long way! I recently moved out of the county but because of the amazing service provided I will go to no other vet/hospital & will always continue to go out of my way to come to the GG Dog & Cat Hospital. Keep up the amazing work Dr. Malo, Dr. Sanchez & the rest of the doctors & staff!</text>< Time>

<review>Great service and friendly staff! I do recommend some of the doctors there. The office is clean, and the staff will patiently take their time to answer all of your questions. Their management of paperwork is much better than some other places I have been to. Everything gets done in a timely manner, and they will keep you updated as to the progress of your pet.

However, beware of the bait-and-switch tactic: Sometimes, they'll give you a price over the phone, but when you get there, it's much more expensive! This was done to me twice. So, get the name of the person that quoted you.

Also, another tactic that was done by a doctor to me (I forgot her name) added another service to one of my dogs without even asking me! Extra cash for her I guess.

Overall, I do like and would recommend this place to my neighbors. Just beware of your pocket book. Some doctors are honest with pricing. But others can act like car  mechanics. Sorry, I'll have to get the names of the good ones later.< /review><resp>None</resp>< Name>

The vets here are genuinely concerned about your pet. They are all very generous and caring, and they have the knowledge to back it up. I always ask for Dr Cork or Dr Mark, but my animals have seen their other vets as well, and they are all fantastic. It's walk-in only, and a very popular vet, so the wait can be long, but it's worth it. They're very up front about costs and don't do anything  unnecessary (like my old vet). I moved out of the area and still drive my animals the 40 min each way! Good vets like this are hard to find.<//text>

Have had three dogs live their lives as patients of Dr. Malo and now his son (UCD vet graduate, no less). I drive over 25 miles now to bring my current dogs to see them for everything because honestly I cannot trust other vets with my dogs. Darla, Chato both lived long lives under their care through many treatments, shots, etc. and now they care for my Chula, Petunia, and Tita. Their prices are very reasonable. For example, after I moved so far away, I tried another vet who tried to gouge me for a $3,000 treatment that Dr. malo said was unnecessary. They saved Chula from parvo as a puppy as well. So the drive and cost of gas is worth the professionalism, compassion, and care my pets receive from GGDCH. The wait can be a roll of the dice, but my dogs are worth it.

I’ve been coming here for about 3 years. I like this place and trust most of the doctors here.  They treat my baby very well and seems like they care.  Vet bills can get costly but the check up of fee isnt as much as some places. Most vets charge 50$- 75$ just for a visit.  They don’t  ever charge me for test without looking at what the cost will be and it’s all broken down for you on paper.  I only had one doctor charge me for something I did not agree with AND SHE REFUNDED ME BACK THE COST FOR THE TEST ( THANK YOU). You as the pet owner make the final decisions on what you think is important for your baby they don’t over charge you for things unless you agree to have certain test done. I drive all the way from Corona Del Mar just to come here. The only thing I don’t like is that there is always a long wait unless you get there early. It’s  very busy here. The staff is very nice sometime you’ll get a moody person but maybe they’ve just had a long day. I don’t let it bother me because if anyone were to get sassy with me I’ll put them in their place !  Lol.< /Text>

highly recommend these Vets and Staff. They
cared for my Cocker Spaniel Scamp for 14 ½
years and my Spunky for 9 years until
November 3, 2016. They will continue to

Dr. Malo showed my cat compassion and really cared about his well being. Something that is unusual these days . He understood the importance of what this cat meant to me . He will always hold a place in my heart he saved my cat.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This place is more interested in getting money out of you than helping your pet. They'll try to sell you on x-rays and examinations that have little to do with the problem. They also have others write good reviews. It's really the hospital trying to fool the unknowing. Be smart. Avoid this hospital.</review>

Doctor Maylo is the absolute best. He becomes part of the family by genuinely caring for everyone pets as many people consider them kids anyways lol. He even helped my fiancée who has always gone to him  network in to her field after she finished college. He also has been there when we have had to put more than one pet down and he just has that perfect bedside manner.</Review>

<Time>1448132587345<//Time><rating>5< /rating><review>I've been using GGDC hospital since 2002.  They were fantastic over the years with my cat, who eventually died at age 20 in 2008. They were always upfront about costs and no over treating and always gave me all options. I chose what options I wanted. When I recued two dogs, one in 2011 and the other in 2012, I stayed with them. Again, they always treated my dogs well. This is a very popular vet hospital and the wait can be long. I've never had a problem with the desk staff who work their butts off. The Vet Techs are also great. I've read a bunch of negative reviews. Folks if you don't realize it, vet care is expensive. Get pet insurance. Also, I've also never worried about my late cat or dogs staying overnight for care.  In fact I still use the vet hospital whenever I'm in town.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I have been going to this place for several months now and I think it is great. From the most recent visit where I had the Big Cheese Dr. Leslie Malo. I was impressed with his explanation of the shots and procedure my dog was going to have. I also have had Dr. Morales (probably my favorite) and she too was very thorough in the appointment. Dr. Schawarzman the jury is still out for him.
The front office does a great job when this place gets hopping. I can't imagine what their stories are like dealing with us crazy pet owners. I also had dealings with this hospital a few years ago in putting our cat down and I can't tell you how great this place was on that difficult trip. Keep up the good work.</review>

< Review>
All they care about is getting your money. Took my baby here when she was pregnant to have ultra sound and blood work done and get on vitamins and they seemed to care about her but then we forked over 400.$ that day too. 31/2 weeks later we took her in(another 40$) to make sure she was ok and was told she's beginning to labor. It was only one puppy she a Chihuahua so they said it might be a C section bring her in if she was having trouble asap. We did the very next morning and we were told baby might still make it if they act quick but momma would die if they didn't remove the puppy. We didn't have the full 980.$ it took us until that after noon to convince them to let us make payments giving them over half then and pay the rest over the next few weeks. They charged us an extra 38$ payment fee. We don't have the puppy but we do have our baby but she's been in a deep depression ever since. This place doesn't care about the animals they treat they only care about the money in your pocket. This is an honest opinion based on fact I don't trust the people at this pet hospital<//Review>

The problem didn't need further testing or anything, they just want you to keep coming back???
Then when I asked for prescription so I could get cheaper generic meds from target, they acted like they wanted to throw us out? Feels like they've done it before. Watch out!

Keep your eyes open if you decide to go there...< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Really great facility. Vets here are quite knowledgeable (especially Dr. Hess and Dr. Cork). Dr. Malo is great as well. Staff are friendly and personable, treating me more like my neighbor than a customer as they genuinely inquire about my family or other pets when I bring one or the other in. My only complaint is the entire doctor staff take lunch for two hours, makes it a tad inconvenient if ya need to bring your pet in and notice it's close to their lunch break. Another issue I've had is sometimes you really need to push the doctor to investigate an issue. My dog was a stray and I'm not an expert or anything, but when I was given the possibility that my dog might have diabetes I wanted it investigated. The doc downplayed the possibility and took the wait and see approach. I was fine with this, as  the docs don't seem to be the type to rack up bills with every test under the sun, but my dog eventually had a diabetic siezure and an mergency visit to the clinic-which cost a lot more than a damn blood glucose test. Great docs here, but ya still need to be your pets advocate and keep a close eye on things. The doc isn't with your pet day in and out so they may miss things.<//Review>

<review>Wonderful, understanding, and caring staff during a tuff situation.

I first brought my 17+ year old cat that I had rescued when I was child here to be euthanized. After another vet literally refused, because he said "she still has some good years in her". Even though she was suffering pooping/throwing up blood, and they couldn't fix her or even figure out why. They just wanted to do more and more expensive test, I'm pretty sure they were just taking advantage of my situation.

And after all that when I took her to this vet and requested the test results and x-rays, for a second opinion before I put her down, they didn't even provide them.

Needless to say I take both my cats here and this is my vet for life now!

P.S. I'm not going to name them because it might get this review removed, but if you're curious about the other vet just look through my other reviews.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>The Drs are great the staff is awesome... T prices r a lil high for me but very very much worth it due to t quality of service n love they give to ur furry babies.. I definitely recommend this vet clinic! One thing I don't like is not being there for my furry baby when they take them back for treatment, i.e. An injection, a skin test, medicating them, stuff that other Vet's let u b present for. That I really don't like, is like u handing ur child over to the nurse when u take ur baby to there pedestrian for shots. I think if our furry children would benefit from having there parents w them..</Text>< rate>

Took my dog in because he wouldnt eat or even move i was freakn out since my dog is sooo active! The wait was about 1:30. Once we finally got a room they immediately brought us an estimate of $900 dollors to keep my dog there. They didnt even tell me what was wrong with him. I finally just asked for a dehydration shot which cost me $50 and $70 for parvo check up i ended up paying $185 just for the check up and shot. Two hours after leaving the hospital my dog was back to normal so my guess was accurate that he was just dehydrated. Instead of just letting me know what was wrong with him they wanted me to pay $900 please dont let these people fool you.< /review>

<review>I brought in my puppy yesterday because she has Parvo. I told one of the ladies that I would be in the car since I can't wait inside with her (Yes, I told her the color and model of the car). She said "ok" and that they would go get me when it was my turn. I waited about 30 mins and came back in to see if they were ready for my pet. Some lady came out and was being rude. She said they were calling us but I told her that her employer knew where I was. She didn't care and told me to wait. Once we got a room, the vet spoke to me about our options. It seemed that it was all about money for him. My friend ended up texting me to see if I wanted to bring my pet to her Vet. I told the the vet at this place that I would go somewhere else, nicely. He said "ok" and opened the door. As soon as he opened the door he yelled, "Someone come in here and bleach down this room! They are going to another vet." All the customers heard what he said so it was awkward walking out. I understand that the room needed cleaning but he didn't have to yell it out so that everyone could hear. I'd rather take my dog to Los Angeles where I know my pet will be treated right.</review>< Pics>

These people do not care about the welfare of animals, just that all mighty dollar.
The neglected and mistreated frenchie I just adopted ate an ibuprofen. Having no money until next week the Garden Grove Dog and Cat Hospital refused to help this little dog. All that they had to do is induce vomiting and give him some activated charcoal. They refused. I figured out how to make him vomit, then ground up a chunk of natural charcoal and got him to ingest some of it. He seems to be ok.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUSINESS!!!<//Text>
