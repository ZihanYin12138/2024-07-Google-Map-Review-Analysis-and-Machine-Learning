Possibly the greatest pizza jawn in all of Los Angeles. Thank you for having the pizza ready, full, pleasing and appealing. I extend my sincerest gratitude. In three years I haven't been pleased with any pizza anywhere. Two days ago you guys made my pizza experience way better. Due to that, I thank you. We order my favorite pizza. Thanks again.< /review>

I'm never buying from this Domino pizza again! I placed an order through the application and when my pizza was delivered it was wrong , so I contacted the restaurant for a refund and they said they will  give me store credit that I never got. I want my money back! I placed an order & you guys decided to not follow instructions to my order and gave me a wrong pizza!I need my money back I don't want store credit or coupon because I didn't pay with coupon!!!< /Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>This location specifically, has 90% of the time gotten my order wrong, or been extremely late when delivering. I ordered 32 Buffalo wings last time. They gave me 22 and no sauce was on the wings. I have waited 3 hours before for a delivery. I ordered at 6 and didn't get my food till almost 10pm. My kids bedtime is at 8:30pm. So we had to change plans for dinner and the management did nothing to correct the issue. I also always get issues when picking up the food myself. My wife orders online and ill pick up the food. They have not let me before because it was not her picking up or I didnt have the card she used, even though my id says the address and I could show them the purchase receipt from my bank statement. Worst dominos I've been too. Only reason I go here is its a 4 min walk from my house. But I often go to further dominos just because this one is such a headache<//Review>< pics>

I’m very lucky that I came back to work at Pizza Hut as delivery driver in highland park(L.A.) cuz they call you right away for the real schedule. Any who I only met some of the people including the assistant manager Mariela who’s real organized and sweet. Hopefully I’ll swing by to visit soon.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>Im giving them a 2 ONLY because the handmade pan is a pretty dang good pizza... This location though is TERRIBLE. They've messed up my order 80% of the time. Wrong crust, or no sauce side, or its cold. I live THREE BLOCKS away! Why is my pizza cold? The last straw was them not even delivering my pizzas and saying they did. I waited an hour and a half, watching the tracker, wondering what was taking so long, then the tracker said delivered but no one had even driver by! And they were closed so I couldn't call to ask what happened. The manager didn't even apologize when I called the next day. They offered a refund. Well OF COURSE you're giving me a refund. You didn't deliver my pizza! Never using this location again.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Pizza ordered looked like it sat in the store all day, wasn't even cut let alone hot and fresh. Wouldn't let me speak with the mgr. And offered store credit. Kidding? Why would I waste my time ordering again!!!! Tried saying because it's thin crust. Like I haven't been a Domino's customer for 30 years!!! Your service was unsatisfactory & corporate was contacted!!!

Pizza is pretty good. You order then they cook it on the spot. Giving three stars because you have to pay with cash and their pizza is only thin crust.</Review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Don’t order from this Dominos. Just pay more money for something else and avoid the disappointment and dissatisfaction. They will take two hours to deliver your pizza when you live .3 miles away and make it seem like they are calling you THEN make up an excuse as to why they took so long. They will say they are outside but when you go outside they aren’t there. The drivers are rude, obnoxious, and don’t understand what customer service is. STAY AWAY. Just get Little Caesar’s.</Text>< Pics>

They take too long to take your order. They don't work fast or together to get orders out. They don't keep track of the orders and have to ask costumers what they ordered. The people at the front can't even take an order it take 2-3 people to take the order and a lady is fixing her hair and picking her nose while folding the boxes where they put the pizzas in.< /review>

Ordered from this location online never had a problem before with delivery but today i placed an order online looked at the tracker and it said it was delivered but I never received the pizza, after a 2hrs plus wait I called and they told me to wait another 5 to 10 min. After waiting 30 min I called again and they couldn’t give me reason why it never got delivered until I spoke with the manager daisy and told me the driver called and knock but there was no call or knock. Since the driver said she allegedly called and knocked but no one answered they had to cancel my order.</Text>

<Text>This domino's is seriously the worse. Last I placed an order it came over 1 hour late, the order was wrong, I spoke to "a manager" who "gave me" credit for getting my order wrong and taking so long. I called one more time to place an order and use the credit, to my surprise "the credit" I was suppose to be given was never applied to my rewards account and the person on the phone was very rude. Never again will I order from them.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
There is no communication between the employees which is strange. I’m not even sure they even have available cashiers because it takes 5 minutes of you standing there for someone to take your order. Even if the employees see you standing there, waiting to pick up a pizza, they simply look at you and ignore you as if it’s not their problem. There’s also something wrong with their cashier registers because it takes an awfully long time for them to give your change back.< /review>

The pizzas were burned, really dry, and not to mention the people working there are so unprofessional. I don't know who's hiring those people. Non the less their paying machines don't even work. Never ordering from them again.<//Text>< pictures>

< review>
I live 4 blocks away, not even a 5 minute drive, why is it that the tracker says it'll take 20-30 mins and it has been over an hour, they even told me the driver left the store 25 minutes ago, this is ridiculous. I don't mind waiting extra here and there but I'm not about to pay for cold food. So much for having a dominos store nearby.</review>

Ordered two pizzas around 6:53p. Called in to check on delivery status around 7:52p, was told that pizzas were out and should arrive around 5-10 min. Called again at 9pm. Dominos associate notifies me that they never left the store. I've ordered from Domino's before and this one was a real let down.</text>

2- bad customer service.
3- no communication between the employees.
4- guy touched his face and then proceeded to touch the dough.
5- waited for my pizza 30 + min and they said it would be 15.

I go in to the store and order my pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. The girl said would be 21 dlls for the pizza itself im guessing for the added topping.The wait time was 15 min, I go back to my car and wait, go back in the store, waiting a little longer and proceeded to ask for my order, i receive it. Go back home, get home and surprise, no toppings...yay. I drove back to store take the pizza and explain the lack of toppings, the girl doesn't even say sorry and proceeds to tell me my refund will be 19 dlls, when first she said the pizza was 21 dlls, basically she gave me the wrong price and they don't acknowledge their mistake. Very unprofessional and im very unsatisfied customer. I get it, you make a mistake, but when you pay more than average for a medium pizza (19 dlls) and get very bad customer service, well this place is not worth it. Don't waste your money or time.

The people who run this store are complete IDIOTS! My mom ordered a pizza at 11:00 am machine called me back 45 mins later to say it was on it's way only to never showed up my mom calls back around 2:00 to see what happened only to have the manager yell at her and make up a story about how a tall Asian threatened to beat up one of the drivers and they won't deliver here.Were all Mexican and short here! He then tried to change the description of the guy and yell at my mom that we can go pick up our pizza but they refuse to deliver. I've been ordering pizza from here for years but never again!<//Review>

<review>The food is good. Taco Tuesday has 99 cent tacos. The only reason this is only 4 stars is because it is too loud inside and the parking lot is dark and scary. That's Canoga Park for you.<//review>< pics>

<Text>A gold mine of tacos. Nothing has been worth the trip even more than to come around here. The food is worth the very monet needed  for a badass time. To me I can say add more to chain and it will stand out amongst all for it's great atmosphere for get togethers involving beers and liquor. I regret nothing in this review.<//Text><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I came in before two caucasian individuals, myself and one other male ordered seventeen tacos each., mind you that i have gotten here first, yet I get my tacos last and it still took a long time to be ready. server is no help at all just looks mad everytime I come in here. word of advice if you're Hispanic, be prepared to wait awhile until others are served first and the tacos are bad.</text>

If I could give a 0 Star to rate this I would, not what I expected at all! I follow the owner on social media. I drove from Ventura county with my daughters thinking we were gonna have the best meal but only to be disappointed and the tacos barley had any meat, poor service, food wasn’t the best, very small, and 47$ for three small tacos 3 enchiladas and a michelava. I don’t mind spending some money on a great meal but I do mind spending money on a meal that was not worth the money nor the drive. Long story short I do not recommend coming here at all! And I apologize to advance to the owner but this is not the service u advertise on your social media.<//review>

Front desk lady didn't speak English during weekday lunch hour. Small sitting area, isn't the most fancy place either. Not a big fan of the food either. You can get a better deal during lunch hour specials at a restaurant.< /text>

(Translated by Google) It is the most expensive Mexican food that I have eaten and the worst thing that nothing delicious I bought 1 taco of roast beef and a muffin of chorizo ​​that by the way was pure fat and tiny, 1 glass of horchata that they give of machine and not natural and for I was charged more than $ 9 dollars, I really do not recommend it at all

(Original)
Es la comida Mexicana más cara que he comida y lo peor qué nada de delicioso compré 1 taco de carne asada y una mulita de chorizo que por cierto era pura grasa y pequeñita, 1 vaso de horchata que la dan de máquina y no natural y por eso me cobraron más de $9 dólares, la verdad no lo recomiendo para nada<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I have been to 3 locations in Tacos Way, San Fernando was one of my favorite locations but I stopped liking it because of the loud music they play there. It is annoying and does not let me have a pleasant time. I recently discovered this small location near my work in Canoga Park and I am delighted with Nora's service, I have always liked tacos way but Nora with her kindness and excellent customer service makes this my favorite location. Neta will raffle that girl, she does everything and is very kind, not like the other bad-faced cuzcas from other way tacos.

He ido a 3 locaciones de Tacos Way, San Fernando era una de mis locaciones favoritas pero dejó de gustarme por la música con volumen excesivo que ponen allí. Es molesta y no me deja tener un rato placentero. Recientemente descubrí esta locación pequeña cerca de mi trabajo en Canoga Park y estoy encantada con el servicio de Nora, los tacos way siempre me han gustado pero Nora con su amabilidad y excelente servicio al cliente hace que esta sea mi locación favorita. Neta se la rifa esa chava, hace de todo y es muy amable no como las otras cuzcas mal encaradas de otros tacos way.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Efficient and they do a good job trying to keep people spaced and waiting outside where it's safer in the times of COVID. All employees were properly masked and the visitors were at about 99% (saw a few noses peaking out). Arrived a few minutes after 9, when they open, and was out the door with a new license at 10. Arrive a few minutes before 9 and I bet you're out in half that.< /Review>< Response>

I hadn't been to a DMV office in years. It seems so organized. It took 30 minutes from beginning to end to register 2 cars. Every one was very helpful. Great customer service at this Tracy DMV office. Thank you all!< /text>

Thank God I was there just to pick up my new tags. But others had horrendous experiences that wanted their whole day there. Hope we see it constantly improving to make the experience a pleasant one.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>I need a real ID. I floundered with the ID-me system for hours. It rejected all of my ID. I finally got it to accept me. Then it said I couldn't have an appointment. I should just walk in. There was a line around the building. After waiting for 15 minutes and thinking about the 2 signs at the head of the line, One said non-appointments and quick questions. with an arrow to the left. The other said appointments and had an arrow to the left. The kiosk was to the left. The entrance door was to the left.

I didn't have an appointment because it said I shouldn't have one. I did have a quick question. Was I in the right line?  So I went inside and waited in that line. I was met with antagonism. I said I did the ID.me on line. She told me I needed to get a number from the kiosk outside. I went to get back in line and she started yelling at me that I was using the wrong door.  I looked around and there was no sign saying that. I felt like I was a criminal. I went and waited outside. 45 minutes later, I still wasn't close to the kiosk. So I figured I would try another day.

I asked a friend who had the same experience and he told me, the long outside line was for non-appointment non ID.me people. He said I had done what I was supposed to. How hard is it to have signs that explain things or at least people with a better attitude?< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Loved it. The people were very nice and it was very well organized. Didn't have an appointment,  but my wait wasn't long. Will definitely go back. And told my husband he should check our DMV in Tracy.< /Text>

Honestly the greeters giving the number are rude, but the employee's working at the desk are supper nice. I'd rather go to the DMV in Stockton, Manteca, or Lodi. I get way better customer service at these locations.</Text>

Frank and Melanie give me great service. They were very patient and Melanie helped me with a registration that had burned in the paradise fire. Also the way the whole
Tracy DMV office handles the customers where they need to go and they are very professional and polite in answering any questions.
Thank you for your service.</Review>

Your location should keep the doors open until 5. Doors were closed and locked at least 5 minutes prior. And very inconvenient for anyone off work after 4. I rushed over here and arrived before closing time and have a super fast transition needed to finish and I couldn’t even walk in the door.< /Review>

<text>My visit to the DMV was my best experience I've ever had with a DMV IN MY LIFE.  Hardly a line maybe 5 people's outside standing which moved quickly just inside the door are two women stationed to take you information and take your temperature.inside  about 15 chairs were safety separated , more then that many people were directed to go back to the car and wait for a text message indicating  their number would be called next. I waited on a chair no longer then 10 minutes before my number was called to be served and at the same time I received a text on my phone as well. Of course I hate spending money at the DMV this time I have to say, I didn't mind being there. The whole trip to DMV was about 15 to 20 minutes in and out! Wat to go DMV THANK YOU! I recommend using the online DMV but I'f your like me and it was necessary to go I recommend it to anyone.</text>< rating>

Kind of confusing since it was my first time there during covid protocol . Staff was really friendly and helpful.  When you first arrive for a non appointment just walk up to the non appointment tablecandcthey can explain quite helpfully .<//Text>

While attempting to get my ID I’ve had to return 3 separate times following a several month period without receiving my ID. EVERY time I’ve returned to bring up how I haven’t received my ID the person working the window would tell me I didn’t take my picture. Only reason they get a 1 star is because the last woman I spoke to was very nice. Other than that this is a 0 STAR DMV.</text>< pics>

<Review>I know this might be hard to believe LOL but my experience today was excellent ! I really liked the way they were checking you in and taking your phone number and texting you when your number was getting ready to be called that way you could just kick it in your car. The girl that helped me at window 7 was really nice and I even asked her a couple of questions about some other things that she answered without hesitation all while smiling.<//Review><user>112986451883318824271< /user></record></dataset><record>

The wheel chair door button doesn't work. That should work for those in wheel chairs and due to social distancing for those that want to push the button with another part of their body vs touching the door handle. The kiosk scanner for renewing didn't work which now you have to touch the screen.< /Text>

Hands down best experience I've had at a DMV, period! Arrived at 7:15am (during COVID) about 16 people in line ahead of me. A DMV rep came out & started checking papers, gave out number and said to come back at 9am since they open late on Wednesdays. I was number 8! Went back at 9am, got called right in, done in 20 minutes. The staff was so nice and even counted down for my picture so I was ready! It was customer appreciation week so it was decorated with balloons everywhere and they had water bottles if you wanted. Super awesome experience!!</text>

<text>Given that we were under COVID protections / restrictions, I think that the DMV did wonderful. They adequately checked our temperatures and gave us a text message / apps that allowed us to wait in our car until called. I got to the counter it was as efficient as it was prior to COVID protections / restrictions. Lastly, the only time I had to de-mask was to take my photo for my REAL id.

All - in - all, it was a success!!!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

If it was just them I dealt with I would have given them 5 stars. Unfortunately I had to take my practical test with the most unpleasant man (office ID no. 642). The guy was so rude, no attempt to be kind or calming in what can be a really nervous experience taking your test. He wouldn’t clarify or explain anything I asked him to, and marked me down on hand signals before I’d even started. Honestly, would it kill him to show an ounce of kindness? I passed the test so I’m not writing this out of spite. I just think he could learn to smile. He is such a bad example of a DMV employee.<//Text><name>Sara Loughlin</name><Rate>3< /Rate>< user>

Due to COVID there are many good restrictions in place. The person assisting me asked to take a seat while finishing processing for my service then went to take a lunch leaving me waiting for over an hour to get my service completed.
Better communication from the staff would be appreciated.< /Review>

I drive from Oakland when I have DMV work to do. I gotta say, this is the BEST DMV Experience ever. The place is clean. Staff are polite. This time, there was a Staff member at the head of the line giving directions and helping customers as they line up. Come on! Is this for real? My last visits at the Oakland and Pleasanton DMV were horrific! Santa Clara DMV staff were by far the rudest people on the planet. This place is the gold standard for DMVs. I am truly a raving fan.< /Review>

<Text>If I had an option to put 0 stars I would! Tracy DMV used to be great,  but they have lost that greatness.  Do not go to this DMV for anything that has to do with registration ! The staff helping outside was rude and stressed out over how many people were waiting and it shows! I used to go to this DMV before COVID  and I'd be in and out. Went there yesterday,  was quoted 2.5 hour wait, ended up waiting 4 hours!!! Then finally get to a clerk who turned me away for a small error on the paperwork . Which still shouldn't have made the paperwork insufficient,  but that dmv is full of new employees who don't know what they are doing. They need better training on processing paperwork.  Also, this DMV's system they have during COVID to help people is terrible!!! Go to Walnut Creek or Pittsburg, way better staff who know what they are doing and way better process during COVID to get you in and out in way less time then 4 hours.<//Text>< pics>

<review>I spend almost 4 hours at this place. I drive from Dublin because I heard here is nice and quick. But it’s really not. They could not finish one sentence at once, always tell you you missed one file at final step. It make me back to line 3 times and still missing another file. Wasting time. I would chose Pleasanton DMV next time, no difference.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x8090180d5a894da3:0x9a494b9b0a638cfb<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Month back myself and my son visited this place ,without an appointment for change of address on DL,(applied for new card) we got the job done within 40 mins,inspite of big rush.
Their token system works well.
All the systems works well and organized.
I also see DMV employee helping the needy to make an appointment online.

Keep up the Good work.<//text>

No organization. The employee inside who helped me was rude and not helpful at all. Luckily another employee helped me fix their mistake since they were not willing to help me after I waited for over 2 hours.</Review>

<text>They have a system for call numbers.  It goes out of order we arrived at 1:30pm.Received number at 2:15pm.  Others that were after us in line were called before us.  They were also in live to take written test.  They need a better system or call numbers in order.  The sequence good around.

Two gate keepers are the first point of contact and assign ticket or answer what Customer need to do for whatever they need - this solved 80% of traffic in my opinion.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Worst government ran facility I’ve been to, I’ve been here 5 times in the last 3 weeks to get an ID and every time there’s an issue. Today I finally have everything they are requesting and ten minutes into closing there systems are down, what a coincidence! They are waisting people’s time<//Text>

Went in for an address change and waited for my number to be called for 1 and 1/2 hours. Then I was finally I called but I was missing 1 document, they wrote a note on my appointment paper that I was already seen and only coming back with the missing documents which was useless because they made me fall in line again with a new number. So all in all with just an address change, I was in here for almost a whole day. This is by far the worse DMV experience I have ever had. You shouldn’t have to be given another number if you are only coming back. Such inconsideration of time.</text>

This is the best DMV I’ve been to. Which, in hindsight, isn’t saying much because the DMV is usually one of the worst places to be, but I surprisingly had no issues getting a California ID after moving here from Michigan. They were quick and made everything easy, plus the lady who helped us was beyond pleasent to work with. She was fast, kind and personable and a true joy to talk to. I unfortunately forgot her name, but I think it was Tonya? I’m not 100% on that though, so don’t quote me. Either way, I was in and out in an hour after giving them all of the paperwork, signing some stuff, getting my photo, and taking the computer driving test. Keep in mind, the earlier you go, the better. I was there by 9am and made it just before a lot of people came in.< /Text>

<review>Very slow, and they don't care that you have to wait. No sense of urgency.  Feels like everyone that works there moves at half speed with no regard for people taking time out of busy schedules to go there.

Clean and comfortable facility which is why they get 2 stars .</review>< pictures>

Needed to renew my CDL (to the Real ID compliant version). Took me five visits to make that happen.

Visit 1: Walked in without an appointment since DMVs are often booked for months in advance. Explained to the helper at the front entrance that I needed to renew my CDL. She handed me a list of documents that I will need to bring in. This included an identity document (i.e. US passport, naturalization certificate, green card etc.), proof of Social Security Number (i.e. SS card, W-2, paystub, etc.) and proof of California residency (utility bills and so on). Went back home to get the documents.

Visit 2: Gathered my US passport, a utility bill, my property tax bill and a paystub because I could not find my Social Security card at the time. Went back to the DMV. The helper looked at my paystub and said it must show my entire Social Security number. Told me I could bring in my W-2 instead.

Visit 3: Brought all the documents back along with my W-2. A representative started processing the license renewal. Noticed I had a CDL and that my medical certificate (expires every two years for CDLs) had expired. Pointed out that they would have to switch my license class down to C if I am not submitting a renewed medical certificate. Decided to acquire a new medical certificate and come back because I wanted to keep the CDL just in case.

Visit 4: Spent $115 and acquired a new medical certificate from Kaiser Permanente in Manteca. Returned to the DMV after a week. When I got to a representative, he claimed that I must have my Social Security card because I was renewing a CDL and not a non-CDL one. Went to the helper near the front entrance who had provided me the list of documents required during one of my previous visits. Tells me the list she had provided was for renewing a non-CDL license and I was supposed to tell them that I was trying to renew a CDL. This was not true and she had also looked at my driver license (says CDL right at the top) when she provided me the document requirements. Hands me a different list required for a CDL. I come back home and notice that the new list mentions the following, "Evidence of your social security number (SSN) is required only on applications for an original commercial driver license and any request to correct a SSN that is already on the driver record data base, regardless of the class." My application was not for an original CDL. It was to renew an EXISTING CDL. Then I also call the DMV Customer Service line and the agent tells me that the DMV should have accepted my W-2 as an alternative as long as it showed the full SSN.

Visit 5: Thankfully I was able to locate my Social Security card. Returned again to the DMV with every document required. A representative processes my entire renewal application and not ONCE asked to see my Social Security card.<//Text>

I arrived at 11:43 without an appointment (if you do a Google search on a place, it'll show you a bar graph that tells you when a good time to arrive based on how busy they are) and waited only a half an hour. The woman at Window 2 helped me and she was probably the nicest customer service agent who's helped me. When I was leaving she said, "have the most wonderful day" and she actually meant it.</Text>

It's day number 126, I thought I heard my number called but it turned out it was only the coughing of the only employee at the one window. I'm making friends with the lawn guys as they will give me warning now so I can take down my tent before they mow. I watched a guy have to pay twice as he was in here so long the registration lapsed again. I fear the local food joints will stop delivering food soon. I don't know when any of us will leave this wicked place. May God have mercy on our souls....< /text>

2. Social Security Card or tax form 1099.
3. Passport (current)
4. Driver's license or other form of picture ID.
5. "Veterans" wishing to have this designation on your CDL bring original DD-214 ("form 4" attached to bottom of DD-214). If your DD-214 doesn't have this attached to your copy you'll need to go down to your Veterans office to order another copy and for them to complete veteran's for AVD-001 to bring to DMV.

Lastly, bring your patience. Remember, by October 2020 (delayed until 2021 due to coronaviris) everyone must have switched to the new federally mandated Drivers License. This is especially so if your traveling. TSA will not accept old license and you won't be able to fly.

14 August 2020; waited in line for 2 hours only to be told their computers are down. Now, they have no control over that but.....  "they could've just made a broad announcement at people in line that it was down instead of having you wait until your number is called to tell you!"<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Worst experience of my life. Rudest person ever. I don’t the name of the disrespectful lady that unfortunately “took care” of me that day I visited (March 30th, 2019). I know DMV offices are know for bad customer service, but this lady took the 1st place. Such terrible customer experience is running the good reputation from all the other nice hard working people at the Tracy location.
I went there because I was recommended. Thanks to her, this location changed my mind.
Please work on your manners and customer services if you’re there to help others.</review><Rate>1</Rate>< user_name>

Terrible quality. Tracy DMV needs a long time just to schedule an appointment (about 2 months+). It took me almost a year from applying to actually getting my license here. My temporary license which had a 3-month active period had to be renewed because the license wasn't even done.</Review>

Fast service at the DMV is always a surprise but as a walk-in I was done within 20-30 minutes.  Staff was super friendly and actually quite helpful.  Facility was very clean inside.  Tons of parking available.

Easially a 5 star experience.</text>

< Review>
I have been to around 10-12 different DMV's in my life and the Tracy DMV is hands down the slowest one of them all. The line wasn't that long, maybe 20 people in front of me, but took around an hour and a half just to get my number.  Once I got my number is when the real wait began.  On average, one number was called every 15-20 minutes.....    this isn't just slow work, you actually have to go out of your way to operate this slowly.  The only reason it's not a one star is because the lady who gave me my number was pleasant and polite<//Review>

They open at 0800.  I show up at 0725, line up to the front door, around the left-hand side, in the back and into the parking lot.  Counted 57 folks in line.  I left.  Saw a couple of reviews that said show up around 4:30 PM and they will get you in and out, so I returned.  Line was only 10 to get in, stood in line for 20 minutes, the place was packed, every seat was occupied, tons of folks standing, or sitting on the floor.  Finally got a person to hand me a form, and said I see that sign says appointments or disabled.  Showed her my VA disability credentials and she stated “We don’t care if you are disabled, get in line, it will be a 3 hour wait”.  I only need to pay them money, get a photo, and finger print to get my license renewed.< /review>

<text>I went to DMV with no appointment this morning. I came prepared to wait for a LONG time according to the other Google reviews. I got there at 8:45am and was 4th in line at the non appointment window. I waited about 15 min in line and the nicest lady helped me out. I needed to change my name on my ID due to divorce and she let me know what document I was missing and then she made me an appointment to go back next Tuesday in the morning! I was so surprised that she was able to get me in so fast and she let me choose the time and date. Crazy how the website shows no appointments at all! So I give her (Tonya) all the stars in the world for being so helpful and making an appointment for me next week. I give the website no stars for being misleading on the appointment portion.
Dmv reps get a bad rap since there are a few bad seeds and lazy folks. But they do deal with a ton of people that already come in with hella attitude ready to be disappointed. Definitely go in ready to wait, but go in with an open mind and heart for the people that are there to do their job to the best of their ability.

****update to my review****
I came back in on my appointment date and time and was helped in line and advised to go to one of their computers to fill out the IDme application for my new ID. It was fast and painless. I was then given a number and called up after about 20 minutes. I was then helped by a very nice and knowledgeable lady (if forgot her name) She processed everything quickly and professionally and then I went to take my new photo and I was done.  I added a star to my review for the great service all the way around. I just cant give it 5 stars because the website and appointment process online is so so bad.<//text><Response>None</Response>< Name>

<Text>After being in California for 8 long years at different locations and obviously like all others been to various DMVs right from LA to SF, the Tracy location is definitely the best. Right from the moment you enter in the person giving out tokens itself are immensely knowledgable, they have great communication skill, understanding of legal requirement and above all they respect customers. I had an address change, state to state car transfer, license renewal and they guided me through all of this pretty perfectly. I had some balance documents to submit for my cars registration and they were very accommodating to give me couple of temporary extensions and also gave additional information to make the process smoother. Usually DMV will be the last place u wanna be in case of a zombie apocalypse, but the Tracy location is very clean and stocked with some nice staff which in fact made my DMV visits all the more satisfying. Seriously never thought I will be writing a Yelp review for a DMV and that too giving it 4 stars.<//Text><rating>4</rating>< pics>

I only give the DMV  (2) stars, the worker/tellers I would give (5) stars, they do their best.  The funding /budgets Jerry Brown funds the DMV, I would give the DMV  ("0") because Sacramento and Jerry Brown only takes care of his own Retirement package, State of California's Private Jet and the over paid Democratic staff that works with Jerry Brown.<//Text>

7 hours at the Tracy DMV  4 hrs waiting in line and 3 hours waiting to take the written test for a California DL only to be told I would have to come back another day Because it was 4:30 And not enough time to take the written test.
This is crazy and the people who work there I guess  could not get a job scooping poop at the zoo so they went to work for California DMV. California is the worst state< /text>

Untrained and unqualified DMV Tracy staff. DMV tracy do not even deserve a 1 (one) star. Recently I went to renew my commercial license with endorsement. I do not want to name the lady but the Lady who took all my documentation did not do her job correctly. She tried to look very professional but she knew nothing about her job. When I received my California Real ID my endorsement was missing. Long story short Tracy DMV manager told me to to go Modesto DMV and only they can make the corrections.  The staff at tracy DMV needs more training especially females. Be careful when dealing with Tracy DMV. Before you leave Tracy DMV check they have updated all your information correctly. Specially if you are carrying a  Commercial Drivers license.</Text>

While the wait was long (they appeared to be under staffed the day I was there) the employees were by far the nicest DMV employees I've worked with. The Manteca DMV had given me the run around but the woman that helped me in Tracy made sure I had all the info I needed.</Review>

<review>I am never one to go to the DMV without an appointment and without necessary paperwork, so I manage to save myself from the usual headaches of the department of motor vehicles. Of all of the DMVs I’ve visited in the San Jose area, Fremont area, and Manteca, this was the fastest, most efficient, and friendliest DMV I’ve ever encountered. It’s small, which can be a problem for those without appointments who may have to wait outside in valley summers, but it’s also to be expected in a small city such as Tracy.<//review>< pics>

<resp>None</resp><Review>Tracy Dmv is 1000% percent better than Pittsburg.  It's about the same amount of wait time if not a little bit less but it's the people that make the experience.  There is less seating and less people and nobody was doing anything crazy.  The Dmv workers are nice and helpful.  The only downside was that the appt wait time online was 34 minutes and we were there for almost 2 hours.  But I guess that's dmv for you.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Cleanest, Fastest, Friendliest DMV experience that I've ever had.
I scheduled a same-day appointment, arrived 15 minutes early, and left 4 minutes before my scheduled appointment time (total time in the DMV=11 minutes), although I bet it would have taken ~30 minutes without an appointment.

Compared to the Pleasanton or Fremont DMV if you live in the Tri-Valley, I say head to Tracy any day middle of the day for your DMV needs.< /text>< pics>

The wait time to renew vehicle registration is over 4 hours. There is a kiosk if you want to renew by credit card, but you have to wait 4 hours to renew with cash. There are over 15 windows to have workers, but they only have 6 open. All available appointments are a minimum of a month out.</review>

<Text>The slowest DMV I’ve ever been to, the people working there take the sweet time to even press for another number, and when you get there, they act like they are your superiors, honestly I believe that all of these unqualify government employees make too much money and do nothing to deserve it< /Text></record>

Place sucks. They didn't take my birth certificate to get my license because they "didn't recognize it". They gave me no valid reason. Frankly, the office manager Kathy came off as incompetent and didn't seem to understand what her job entails<//text>

My husband was a walk in and I dropped him off there at 9:10 am, it is not 2:55 PM and he's still there waiting... all he went to do was take his written motorcyclist test. This place is completely ridiculous. That's 5 hours of a wait time on a THURSDAY.< /review>

Although it's an upscale high-end retailer it's not just for the snooty and elite it's a comfortable store which anybody could shop in if they can afford it of course but it's not like most high-end retailers. It's a comfortable store that anyone would feel like they belong there. My favorite thing about the store is not just high fashion, it's the highest quality that will last for a long time and stay in style as well!< /Text>

Amazing experience. A must see if u are anywhere near LA. A truly a Hollywood experience. Plenty of space along the road to park for a short while and stroll and shop. The Palm trees are very mesmerizing and very unique to California.<//Review>

Got my girl a new Coach bag for her birthday. She has 3 already but it’s what she said she wanted so whatever. I found a pattern I thought looked good and was different than what she already has. The girl working told me she like it too so hopefully it’s a good pick haha.< /Review>

To be honest i had really bad experience with this brand , i bought a coat after two days i want return it and no one try to help me even the costumer service try to bush me to take it aways . I am in the store and they do not help me as the policy’s here in US even its wrote on the back of receipt i have 30 days to return the items. I really advise to avoid that shop and brand.
Best regards<//text>

I don't understand how You can be so rude to customers who support You paying for Your rent and bills! I don't have to be stupid to feel that employees judging customers and making fun of them. Shame of You for this disquisting behavior.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>After being completely ignored at a different store down the street, we came to my partner’s other favorite brand store. Natali has been absolutely amazing. All staff have been super friendly but I want to rave about how awesome Natali has been as she guided us step by step with finding the exact items my partner wanted; even adding pins and tags and monogramming items. I will happily shop here in the future and highly recommend working with Natali.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Horrible.  Flew from Tampa to California.  Went into the Rodeo Drive Store.  Older Female Associate gave us this entire hard pitch on how all the New Disney Coach Bags were so hard to get and you could only get there and in Orlando (and maybe a place or 2 if lucky outside of US).  We stressed to her that we were not checking in bags to fly home and that we didn't want to get a lot of items unless really worth it and would be that hard to get.  She said only in her store and in Orlando, and as well were flying off the shelves.  So we bought so many things, stressed in backing it all in our carry ons to fly home.  Low and behold, we were walking through our International Mall in Tampa a week later...they were all right there on shelf.  She flat out lied to us to get a sale.  Shame on you Coach.  Very pissed.  Horrible, horrible, horrible thing to do to mislead to get sales.  Oh yeah, she also says to us as we were paying for, "please do not put this on eBay."  She was totally hyping us and false impressioning us.  Just flat out bad.  Will never buy Coach agin.  Pathetic you need a sale that bad on Rodeo Drive....guess so.</review>

< Review>
Coach is absolutely disgusting for selling REAL FUR. Search "chinese fur farm" on youtube and see what these animals had to go through just for tacky fur clothing. SHAME on Coach for supporting the fur trade for just a fashion statement.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Incredibly great street for ordinary people, unfortunately everything priceless. You can even see a star here if you're lucky. You can see cars here that you only dream of. So just walk down this street and look around and look at everything in detail. It is definitely worth it!

(Original)
Unglaublich tolle Straße für den normalen Bürger leider alles unbezahlbar. Man kann hier sogar ein Star sehen wenn man Glück hat. Dazu sieht man hier Autos von die man nur träumt. Also einfach diese Straße entlang laufen und sich umschauen und alles genaue anschauen. Lohnt sich auf jeden Fall!<//Text>

<Date>1620805548823< /Date><rating>5< /rating><text>I've been here a handful of times now since their opening in the Hemet Hallway [OOPS, I meant the Hemet Mall], and this visit was especially awesome because it was our first time dining out in an actual restaurant since the pandemic hit! It felt great to have a taste of normalcy in the form of a relaxed, dine-in atmosphere. We ordered the Crunch Dragon Roll, and the baby lobster tail roll, along with a California roll each, and a shared cucumber salad with added shrimp! All were delicious! I don't come here often, but when I do, I never leave disappointed, and the check + generous tip even are never too outrageous either. Would have to rate this 👌 👏 👍 A-OK in my book. Doesn't hurt that I have grown pretty fond of sushi in general!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I love the baked lobster rolls and baked scallop rolls. The noodle dishes are good also.</review>

Decent place but not overly "great" at anything in particular. My sushi roll has a very generous amount. Real Sushi lovers might be best trying somewhere else but you could also do worse than here</Review>

<review>The food is so good but they constantly get our order wrong and then dont correct it! They just say "That's so weird! I made it myself! That's so weird!" We love the food but this is the 4th time in a row that we haven't gotten what we paid for!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I do love sushi and they do make pretty good plates. Yet, by the beach it's fresh!  You can't get any better fresh sushi if you're by the beach, or else I'd give them a 5 if they were by the beach with sushi that was just caught and made!!!!< /Review>

I adore this spot! They offer superb food, their menu is decent, The chef in that spot is a professional, I enjoy a lot eating all their food. The dishes are always fresh, the attitude towards the customers  is efficient. I  go often to this restaurant and I not even once was disappointed. I recommend it to all.</text>

<Review>This place is fantastic, great service, great sushi, good location. A little on the pricey side and no all you can eat style of ordering. All in all, really good family environment and beautiful restaurant.< /Review>< UserId.>

I thought I was ordering a poke plate. I've never had poke served like that and didn't like it. Would not order again, it reminded me of dogfood out of a can.<//text>

This could easily be a 5 star. Its clean. The food is simply amazing and the staff is really friendly. However attentiveness, asking if something is needed and listening when you talk could really use some work. Often times am done eating and sitting around waiting for the check or drinks needed a refill 15-20 min ago<//review>

<Text>Today for my daughter's birthday we were planning a Sushi brunch, when I called the number on the website it somehow called a location in Perris. I arrived, and the unprofessional skinny guy gave me such a hard time and said my order was not ready! Ok, I understand I called wrong place but wouldn't good service be more like
I'm sorry you called wrong place, let me get your order started for you. He was sooo rude that I walked out . They just lost a customer that would buy 4x a month. Please, owner show some manners and customer service to your employees. Never again will I return.<//Text>< Name>

<Text>I felt this was the worst experience I've ever had here. Lived here for 10yrs and have been here several times but this time was the worst. Feel like I was treated with disrespect because I was black. The looked at me with disgust when I came in, sat me in the back of an empty restaurant and I waited 30 mins for a California Roll and a Spicy Tuna roll that NEVER came. Had to leave because I had an appointment to get to and thought service would be much faster. I had to flash my work badge just to get the little respect I did get. I will never spend my money in this restaurant again and will be telling my colleagues. An extreme disappointment.</Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>It's probably one of the better sushi places in town. I really like their ponzu sauce and I tend to go with their sashimi the most. It tastes fresh and looks appetizing. If I were to critique anything it would be service. It could be a little friendlier and more available.< /Text><date>1560460555960<//date>< Pics>

<review>The reason I’m giving a one star is simply because that have very slow service. There is very little staff and food takes a very long time. The food isn’t bad but the service sure is. Hope they improve. They are very selfish because they never have discounts for special occasions ex.mothers day<//review>< date>

<Review>My favorite sushi place in town. Can be a bit slow/busy in the evenings particularly a weekend evening so if you're hungry come early. Love that they serve sapporo and have always had great sushi. The bento lunch boxes are very reasonably priced and worth the visit as well during the weekdays. Have not been dissappointed yet 😊. Just don't get the miso to go, the hot soup kind of melds with the styrofoam, not tasty<//Review>< username>

<review>Hello my name I Danny and I am a bodybuilder competitor/realtor/business owner/college student I’m very disappointed I was looking for place that serves quality and has good customer service.all the sushi in the pic looked totally different than what was brought to me and I was very dissatisfied there was so much crab meat and rice  my Rolls didn’t even have anything in the center of them my little girl as well and my other little girl and my wife  I ordered the dragon roll and there was not a single piece of eel inside I’m not the type of person that had a bad day and wants to just pick on something I’m the kind of person that works hard for my money and I expect quality I don’t just want the guy it’s there for a check I want to guy that actually loves doing his job you guys need to turn it around your business would be a lot busier just an  observation ✅💪💪💪💪💯<//review>< Pictures>

Well it used to be good here...what happened? Beef yakisoba full of old tasting noodles and gristly reheated steak from yesterday? I will not be back. Too bad. Have gone here for 20 years.</Review>

Food is great, only problem I had was how short staffed they are sometimes. It took a while before we were attended for our drinks and food order. But aside from that, I always enjoy their sushi.<//Review>

I recently moved to this area from the central coast and this is the best sushi restaurant here! Quick service and wonderful, fresh food. My husband and I even had a great time at the sushi bar watching Gilbert make the rolls</text>

I did like the place. The Miso soup was tasty and hot.  To bad they couldn't accommodate for me as I can't eat mayonnaise, most sushi places don't have any issue helping me with that. All in all, I'd go here for a decent lunch.< /Review>

<text>Consistantly great!!!  We have been going here for years and we keep coming back.  I got Samurai Sushi gift certificates for Christmas.....need I say more.  Most importantly, the fish is always fresh, and the flavors are outstanding.  There are delicious rolls not on the menu.  Try Jr. roll (especially if you like onions), and Cesar special roll.  You won't be disappointed.  Also I consider myself a sushi junkie and rate this sushi restaurant as among the very best I have ever been to.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Sushi was overpriced for the quality, and the service was slow and discourteous.  The California rolls were a joke.  The nigiri was lacking in flavor despite the generous cuts.  Not the worst place I've been to, but I would not recommend it.</review>< pictures>

I have dining here since it first opened under original owners and normally love it.  Today, as I walked up I saw the county health inspector had given them a C rating.   YIKES!  Still, I figured they must have fixed this since the C rating....  I walk in to place a to-go order and I have not been in the door two seconds and a gal wanted to take my order and now.  I say I need a few seconds to figure out what I need and she hands me a pen and walks away. 10 minutes later I am still waiting to place my order... I stand at register another 2 minutes while the waitress and cook giggle and laugh with one-another (as opposed to paying attention to waiting customers.    Then I left and WON'T be back!</text>

<Text>It's a nice little park. I deliver groceries out there in the area often. It's great to take a break there and the restrooms being open is the main thing for me. Since I spend a lot of time driving not to many options.</Text><resp>None</resp><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

<Text>Large shade structure with benches, but the bathroom blocks your view so you can't watch the water pad and the playground at the same time. Not the worst thing, but annoying if you have multiple kids who go separate directions.</Text>< rating>

I've heard people say that they won't use Arco gas. But I have a Toyota Solara that I bought in 1999 and I have used Arco gas in that car since I bought it. When I bought my car I read the owner's manual and it told me that I could use regular unleaded gas that I didn't need to use the more expensive grade of gasoline. So here we are almost 20 years later and I'm still using Arco gas. the gas prices as high as they are I can't believe that anybody would buy gas from anywhere but Arco! They always have the best prices sometimes $0. 50 a gallon cheaper then the other gas stations! And if you pay cash you even get more value for your money! Why anybody would go to Mobil Shell or Chevron is beyond me? So for me the proof is in the pudding, I've got almost 300, 000 miles on my Toyota and Arco gas has been just fine for my car!<//Text>

<text>I am 26 years old and only went to the dentist for emergencies. I had so much I needed done and they worked an entire plan out for me. From cleanings and extractions to braces. They are affordable and they are quick. I never have to wait when I go in for an appointment. They are super helpful and I’m so excited to be getting the smile I’ve always wanted. Braces are never fun but they are making my experience with them a lot better. Thank you western dental!!!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>So far very efficient friendly and professional. They ended waiving X-ray fees, because I had a bad experience with another local dentist who only did a mediocre cleaning and ran up my yearly X-ray benefits . I call that compassion , fairness great costumer service. Front / back staff is exceptional and knowledgeable .  Would recommend.<//text><Resp>{'time': 1617724934406, 'text': 'We are glad you enjoyed your experience at Western Dental. Please visit us again soon!'}<//Resp>< date>

Western Dental in Madera is extremely professional. My Service from Dr. Kim has been  exceptional. I truly believe he cares about my Orthodontic progress and will ensure I have a successful Treatment Experience. The Dental Hygienist are consummate professionals as well. They do a great job of taking care of their patients. I always get a reminder call a few days before my appointment and I get a confirmation text the day before. I can make changes at anytime if I need to and I can be seen on an emergency basis if I ever need it. The Madera location of Western Dental is Wonderful. They acknowledge you by name when you walk in the office and are always so positive.</text>

<Text>By far the worst dentist I've ever been too. Went there years ago for a root canal one of the most painful experiences of my life. Had to go back several times because they couldn't do it right. Had to get 2 different dentists to finish it. Extremely painful didn't even bother to ask me if I needed more numbing extremely rough. Still get pain in that tooth to this day. (Which is why I'm writing this). Tried to talk to management about it. So terrible I stopped paying my bill until I talked to management never could get to talk to anyone so they just sent me to collections. I could keep going on about how terrible it was but I'll just finish with I have lost them business by telling any and every one about how terrible they are and will continue to do so until hopefully they go out if business. Also they try to get you to do tons of unnecessary work done on your teeth as well. Never go to western dential seriously.</Text>< pictures>

After my routine dental exam, x-rays and cleaning I will not be coming back. It's taken a total of 3 visits (4 if you count the call I got to reschedule my 1st appointment) to get what normally takes only 1 visit at my previous dentist. The only reason we had to come here is due to my husband's insurance contract. We drove 30 minutes to get to this office only to be told they didn't have time to see us or finish our exams TWICE when we had appointments. They clearly overbook themselves and then fall behind.. Bad customer service.  Thankfully open enrollment is in September and we'll be choosing different dental insurance so that we no longer have to come here.</Review>

Myself and family have been getting treated here for 10+ years now. Great service and kind staff. highly recommend. Always there to answer questions and take the time for you. Even when busy at times I am checked on, informed and treated professionally. Very disturbing to read negative reviews knowing people are not being truthful and leaving out alot of the good that is being done for them. Thank you all at western dental, you work hard , are appreciated and have many many grateful patients :)< /Text>

<Text>I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL! I got my braces from there and switched orthodontist ASAP they are horrible! My boyfriend still goes there and they have horrible service their brackets break so easy you can literally be brushing ur teeth and they just fall off and the ortho just says to not use mouthwash bc it’s to strong! I understand it’s cheaper than most places but I recommend spending the extra money on a good orthodontist.</Text>< gmap_id>

<review>The 5 stars is strictly for Julie, she is beyond amazing! My whole family goes to this location, she is never assigned to assist us and somehow ALWAYS ends up being the one who helps us the most. She is so caring, so patient, so informative, and so kind, it makes me want to give her a hug every time I see her. I'm sorry to say this location isn't very helpful, always all over the place and I need to come prepared with my records to get what I need done, but Julie, bless her, goes our of her way to get things done fast and efficiently for us!! Thank you JULIE<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Got my braces here, got my fillings etc here. My biggest regret was choosing western dental, long waits even if you have an appointment and come early. So if you plan on coming here be sure to have the whole day free you’re going to need it. Overpriced for the quality of professionalism they give.< /Text>

I just want to thank Hector so much for being such a great Dentist!! He made me feel more than comfortable while he was working in my teeth! No pain AT ALL. And he checked on me every couple minutes to see if I was doing good during the dental cleaning process! I definitely would like for him to work on my teeth again, he really did an outstanding Job, and he’s also very friendly and nice! ASK FOR HIM!!<//Review>

<text>I haven't been to a dentist in several years and was worried about how it would go. I'm glad to say my experience was wonderful. I felt all the staff was very attentive and kept me informed throughout the process and discussion of my treatment plan. I felt Elisa and Dr. Saleh were instrumental in helping me make the best decisions for the procedures I needed. When it came to work that required a specialist Elisa went above and beyond to help me find a place that would be the best fit for what I needed.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The staff is amazing. I walked out of two dental appointments at other offices and am happy I did not settle.

They take payments and are lgbtq friendly which is refreshing. Sometimes when They are booked up, an appointment may run behind but not by much and only because they are taking care of another patient with the same thoroughness with which they will be caring for you.<//review>< pictures>

Nicole is absolutely the best RDA in the office. If you need work on your braces, she’s the one you want to be set up with. She Does her job nicely and accurately. Highly recommend her in the Madera office.<//Review>

<Review>Dr.Saleh was very friendly and professional. I had a broken front tooth which she fixed perfectly and even though I have a lot more work to get done, that little bit she did has already made me love my smile more.
Her assistant Patricia was very friendly and professional as well. She helped me feel at ease by talking to me because she could tell I was a bit nervous and was super helpful with any information I didn’t understand.  Both great!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Gmap_id>0x80940bf3cb45177f:0xd95f7244648f19e9</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<text>I had an implant placed 2 weeks ago where i had a "partial" tooth replacement, long story short, it ended up breaking 2 days before I'm supposed to go out of town. Dr. Saleh did a wonderful job at replacing a temporary denture and Dental assistant Julie accompanied her and she's the nicest and makes you feel comfortable!<//text><name>Jay Marie</name>< rate>

Corina the receptionist was very polite and super patient with me and my crazy insurance, she was a huge help and got me in in no time. Jessica the dental assistant in the back was great, very efficient and fast, definitely someone who knows her stuff. And finally Hector the hygienist, he really took his time and gave me one of the best cleanings I've ever received. Would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a great cleaning.

This place is amazing just walking in through the doors you feel this great vibe everyone makes you feel welcome , Dr. Smith always try’s his best to put a smile in you’re Face if you’re having a bad day, he actually try to know a little bit about you he enjoys he’s job and loves making smile , but can’t forget about Nicole and Eddie always fixing my braces and brackets when they break , never complains even if the process takes longer love it when they attend me something I also do enjoy is that they do things quick I’m in and out of the places with a great job done! And  the receptionist always greets you magnificent and with love😊 I would definitely recommend this place.<//review>

I wasn't a big fan of Western dental, but I went ahead with their service. The staff was always so polite and kind. One staff member in particular that always stood out and made my visits amazing with her smile, courtesy and professionalism. I believe her name is Nicole R. She is such a beautiful soul, also she is a great asset to that company!</Text>

I am here right now, just waited 2 hours just in the waiting room alone, and now I am continuing waiting in the back. It isn't right to have children miss school only to have them sit in chair for hours with no entertainment whatsoever. They over- book their doctors...i do NOT recommend this place!</review>

Western Dental has the worse customer service ever. I have been paying on this account without having any appointments. Billing department always call me and ask for a different name they say they can't speak with me because I'm not on the account. I have repeatly ask them to please correct the name on my account and they haven't done so. I asked to change my adress and to send me a statement of my payments and they never send me anything. I regret going to this place for my braces. The worst experience I have gone through. Never ever will recommend someone to this place.<//Text>

Dr.saleh and her assistant Patty are great they told me that I was doing great and to breathe calmly and they left my teeth feeling great and healthy Yes I did feel a little bit of pain but I was fine they did it so quick that I thing it only took like five minutes. Dr. Saleh is a great dentist I hope to see her again soon for when I go for my check up in six months and I also hope to see her assistant Patty as well I hope to see them soon love your work.</review>

<review>My kids were uneasy going into the office, but after meeting Julie and Dr. Saleem, they were able to put my child's unease to rest. They took the time to show them how the instruments work and that most of them are not as scary as they sound. Thank you for your time and patience with my  kids!<//review>< gmap_id>

The availability is flexible, the orthodontist is super nice and understanding and explains everything in your treatment plan. My biggest issue with this office is I contacted someone with the billing department and was told she would call me back, over two weeks later I still received no call. I called back to check in on things and as soon as I gave her my date of birth she knew who I was, she had said she wrote down a bunch of things to explain to me but then put me on hold because she apparently lost the paper. The fact that I didn't get a call, and she lost the information is so frustrating and unprofessional in my opinion. I'm at my with ends when it comes to this ongoing issue I've had to the point where I'm going to have my braces removed and go to a different company. I have made all my payments and they messed up and sent my account to a debt collector when it wasn't supposed to go there, it ended up on my credit and they are still working on fixing it and getting it off my credit.< /Review>

This last time i visited i had to take in my nephew and nieces as walk ins i went in at 830 and all three of them were quickly taken back! I had the best experience this time around and would recommend this office again.  Jessica was so kind and understanding with the kids and made the 1st time experience for one my nieces a very pleasant one.  My daughter went into the Ortho side and I had the pleasure to work with Elisa on the pricing of my daughters braces she was very considerate and accommodating with finding me the lowest monthly payment available for me and my available income.</Text>< rating>

This place here in madera California office are money hungry my daughter needed braces and she receives medical and it supposed to cover it and they just went rite in to have me pay for braces they didn't even run Medicare to c if they cover it. From my understanding ppl had there braces cover and didn't have to pay out of pocket with medical. I felt like I been scam by them now I'm screwed and have to pay for it.<//text>

< Review>
Why don't you have a direct phone line to call the madera office? If you speak English it's extremely frustrating just trying to explain to the operator who clearly speaks Spanish and has such a heavy accent you cant understand him and he doesn't seem to understand English that well! It's pretty bad when you'd rather drive to the office just to make an appointment, I suggest getting a bilingual operator who clearly speaks both languages if you can't just put the direct office line<//Review>

I waited 40 minutes to be called out of the waiting room, had x-rays and was then left waiting for my cleaning for two hours without being given a time frame, an offer to reschedule or an explanation. They acted like that wait was common and how they normally operated. I finally gave up & left without the cleaning.  I won't be back. There are dozens of other Dental offices in Madera and i've already scheduled a cleaning at one.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>I went in because I was having pain due to my wisdom tooth, and once I was called in Julie was very polite, and see listened to what was going on. She sat me down a few moments later a Dr came in (can't remember his name) he checked my tooth then left to see my X-Rays. Then another doctor came in, Dr. Kaur, she was so attentive. She told me she could get my wisdom tooth out, It was a fairly busy day but she took her time and took it out with ease, then Julie came back in she told me how to care for my new wound and let me go. The waits are long because people can't get there their heads that you're getting tooth care your not at the DMV to pay tags. So if you can choose who attends you I recommend you ask for Julie and Dr. Kaur they are amazing, quick, and gentle.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Rate>5</Rate><Response>None<//Response>< name>

<Text>The staff here is great! However, the oral surgeon was very inconsiderate and rough. I went the get my tooth pulled 5/30/18 and instead of making me feel comfortable and getting to know me, he laid me back and went right in without as much as a "hello". After pulling my tooth, he left the bloody tooth and tools right on the table, did not tell me bye or have a great day, and just moved onto the next patient. I forgot his name, starts with a M.. on top of that i have no insurance, so STOP ADDING ON CHARGES I DO NOT NEED! Its fine to recommend, but when im in pain all i need is the issue fixed, not thousands of dollars worth of recommendations that you guys like to add on.. Im never returning to wester dental, ESPECIALLY the one in MADERA. W.D doesnt get to know their patients they treat you like a object with no emotions....< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

First, the cleaning hurt...I've NEVER had a cleaning hurt before.  They use what looks like a waterpik to clean your teeth.

And the two fillings, never stopped hurting (I usually give a filling 3-4 days to heal)...After a week I went to my now current dentist and he said the fillings were done wrong AND with filling material that hasn't been used in over 10 years....Great!  So he re-filled them and they no longer hurt.

Needless to say, I stopped going, I stopped my family from going...I will never go back, ever.  I would rather perform dental work on myself then let them touch my teeth again.</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>I arrived and checked in at 10:00am and did not leave till 1:15pm. I give the wait time no stars!!! I am really disappointed at how the assistants DO NOT KNOW HOW TO X-RAY. They have to take several several images, that is harmful. And YOU CAN NOT TAKE BACK EXPOSURES ONCE EMMITTED. I think they can train more on that part it's important to get it done right the first time. Selena was kind and helpful she asks a lot of questions and made sure my needs were met. I met the knew hygienist and he is nice and did my cleaning which hurt since it was done with a metal pick not sure if it's suppose to hurt like that.. the wait time is hard to bare...but they are kind. I had an appointment last week before today's visit for my tooth pain, which the dentist said whoever did my fillings did them wrong, since it's hitting my nerves, I was not happy to hear about that because now I have to be referred out for a possible Root Canal...But I really do enjoy ortho, the main reason I went to western dental was for ortho, the previous orthodontist dr. Nee is amazing, focusing on patient care and time management. But he's no longer there. The assistant Eddie is quick, kind and helpful. Dr.Nee and Eddie listened to my needs. I met the new dentist today but he was quite busy on electronics.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Worst experience ever!! lack of professionalism no sense of urgency and lack of communication. I checked in for a regular annual check up at 11:59 and left at 2:43. I waited about 30 minutes to get my X rays done then I was told to wait out in the lobby before my exam. After another 30 minutes i was called inside and sat in the chair and waited for an 1hr 35 minutes before someone came in to do my "Exam" which lasted about 3 min. I had 3 different staff members saying that they already thought I had my exam done and that's why I was waiting long. then after the exam someone asked me if someone had come back for a consultation after I said no another staff member walks in for a 2 min recap and asked me if I wanted to get the services done today , I was so tired of waiting there that I refused to get any services done so that I can go home and look for another dentist in town. this was my 3rd visit at this facility and my last.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Western Dental is horrible. Today I went as a walk in because the main doctor told me the time before to walk in for a bracket. I walk in at 9:00 AM I tell the front desk why Im there and they tell me to have a seat. Finally at 9:20 they call me back. Nobody looks at me for 50 minutes. At 10:00 someone asks me what Im in for today, I tell them and they get the tools and stuff, 30 minutes later I text my mom and tell her ive been there for over an hour and they have done nothing. She calls and tells them to fix my bracket so I can leave. A worker walks up and says Hi, your mom called and said youve been waiting for a while, what do you need today? I told them for the 3RD time what I needed. They then say that the doctor who told me to walk in for this bracket no longer works there and they cant & wont do anything unless I have a schedueled appointment. They basically asked me to leave. I need a bracket and Ive been waiting for 2 and a Half hours. I am LIVID. I ask them If I should just leave and they say that they wont do anything unless I have an appointment. So I walk out after waisting 2 hours of my day. Thats why its called a WALK IN. If they really couldnt do anything they should have told me when I first walked in.<//text>

I had made an appointment at 2:00, an hour went by and I was still in the waiting room seeing people that got there later than me and  being taken inside got me mad until I finally said something they took me inside and I was waiting another 30 min until I cancelled my appointment and left, I would of been there longer if I hadn't said anything, I am definitely never going back .< /Review>

(Translated by Google) They are useless and the service is horrible I do not recommend it and then they charge you for service that they never did. Don't go to that place. And then you talk to them and they say that you can't help yourself and they just make you talk to different numbers like less

(Translated by Google) For the first time I visit this place, I made an appointment 4 days in advance, the appointment was for 3:00 pm and they gave at 4:15 pm, I am still waiting for what services will the doctors do now?
If irresponsibility starts from the time of your appointment.

Por primera vez visito este lugar, hice una cita con 4 días de anticipación, la cita era para alas 3:00pm y dieron alas 4:15pm, aún sigo en espera que servicios harán los medicos ahora?

Not worth the hype. Paid $150 for full set and pedicure. Did not get the luxurious service they say they offer. Kind of a rush job and my nails are bubbled and not painted all the way..the designs I got don't match and are already falling off after a few days. I expected much more, but I think you may need an appointment with some of the bigger artists. The people in those chairs looked to receive a lot better service.< /review>

My Mother was serviced by Lisa today. Lisa felt the need to rush through her work and ripped her thumb cuticle open badly enough for it to bleed. Lisa didn't provide any type of first aid other than to glue a nail tip on top. SUPER RUDE! Not impressed. Check out the pics below!  Thanks for charging my mom almost $100 for what should have been a wonderful relaxing experience into a lesson of who NOT to ever use anymore!<//Review>

<text>Most of these people don't wear mask, my nails were bad, i'm not person to start complaining honestly when I seen my nails, I told myself I'm never coming over here again. On the other had the woman that did my toes was very nice. I only tipped her.  The guy that did my nails was working way to fast doesn't take the time and can't do short oval nail.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>My family and I switched to this place after the nail shop by Trader Joe's in Stockton started charging more and doing less.  Very satisfied with this shop.  It is HUGE!!  Always a chair open and their prices are reasonable.  Worth the short drive from our home in N Stockton.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

The best pedicures I've had in a long time. However, this past Friday, I experience the best one ever. I actually fell asleep. It was the most relaxing and all around great. 10/10 would recommend this hidden gem.< /review>

This place is awesome. I rarely go get my nails done because I always feel rushed and judged. Went in and felt at home, from the friendly staff who took her time making sure my nails were perfect. They will not let you leave until your nails are safely dried. Worth every penny. It was extremely refreshing and absolutely a place I will be back to.< /text>

Great experience! The salon is very clean and the decor is wonderful! Everybody was very nice and friendly! Lan did the best job on my nails and just made me fall in love. She was very attentive and made sure I had the exact shape I wanted. She make sure you're happy with everything even before you leave, and let you know that you can come back if you have any issues. I am so pleased with the level of professionalism and results. I look forward to coming back to get a manicure!</text>

The space was comfortable and clean. My nail technicians were nice and very detail-oriented, making sure my nails were perfect. I normally go to a different nail salon but will be going here from now on. It's hard to find a good nail place in CA - this place met and exceeded my expectations. Lisa is incredibly nice and squeezed me in last minute! She did a wonderful job on my nails and I had an overall amazing visit!</Review>

Love this place. Clean salon with great service. Had such a great experience that I'm certain I'll be a repeat customer. The staff are kind and attentive! They cleaned up my nightmare dip manicure from another salon and somehow still salvaged my nails underneath. Very meticulous with nail design. I literally had the most amazing experience.</Review>

Growing up in a salon I naturally have high standards for my nails. I’ve never found the right salon until I stopped by Ben and Kenny salon. They are so kind, talented and hilarious! I’m never unhappy with my nails and they always cater to every need I have and make sure I like everything they’re doing. At this point they’re like family and I have so much appreciation for them. They never disappoint! 5 stars doesn’t do them justice!< /review>

<Review>Excellent work! Love my nails! Ben is superb! Beautiful salon, but it's sad that it's not as busy as it should be! Prices are lower than anywhere else too, but not the quality! It may not be in a superb location like the others, but way worth its weight in gold! Give it a try! I'm sticking with this place! Call book a reservation, to ensure you don't wait! I'm keeping my money local and supporting a great service!</Review>< Pics>

I got my eyebrows done by Nancy and she destroyed them. She cut the length off and made them completely uneven. Prior to her waxing my brows I asked for the best person because I'm so particular and just wanted them cleaned up. I also got a get mani that only lasted three days before it started chipping. They charge a bit much for the quality. I will not be returning.< /Text>

VIP Nails & Spa is easily the best nail salon in Lodi. When I moved here, I tried out multiple nail salons. While many were nice, none lived up to the quality of service I received at VIP Nails & Spa. Everyone is super friendly, thorough and careful. They were very attentive and they did a great job. Vivian is literally the best nail technician I have ever had in my life. I'm a lifelong customer thanks to her. Go to VIP Nails & Spa and ask for Vivian - you'll thank me later.<//Review>

I went in asking for a very natural white hombre look, I asked my technician Jack to please make sure there wasn’t a lot of pink in my nails. I asked him to fix my pinky because it was crooked and instead he argued with me and said it was fine and made me feel like when I told him I didn’t really like pink that I was wrong and it looked good. I didn’t get anything I asked for instead I got lumpy nails that are lifting and crooked and none of my nails are the same size either. He sat there and gossiped with his friend next to him the whole time, it was a horrible experience and I will never be back.< /Text>

This place is beautiful and clean! The biggest nail salon I’ve ever been in. It’s over 7500 sq ft and honestly feels like the Las Vegas of nail salons. Seriously can’t believe there is this caliber of a nail salon in Lodi!!

The nail technicians I go to and trust is Jack (@JackVipnails) and Lisa2 (@lisanguyen36) for acrylics and for pedicures and regular manicure I go to Little. They are the BEST.

Highly recommend this place!</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I keep forgetting to post my review. I have been checking out different nail salons in the Lodi area but had not found any I really liked. When I went to VIP NAILS & SPA, I was immediately impressed. I believe her name was Bella, she was so sweet. She even gave my advice for wedding planning. Overall I left satisfied. Within a week almost all my nails were chipped, obviously I was bummed, but when I called to schedule a time to come in I wasn't met with push back. When I arrived, it was decided that the whole thing needed to be redone. It was so refreshing to get great customer service, as it past places I have been blamed for the polish chipping. They had just gotten new machines, which is why my no-chip chipped so quick. my new no chip manicure lasted more than 3 weeks. I already made another appointment before I go on a trip. I definitely recommend this place!< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Most of the staff is friendly, but unfortunately their products are extremely cheap, resulting in poor quality sets. Their ATM also mentions that it is only one dollar, but when I looked at my bank statements, it charged me 3 dollars and 50 cents to use their ATM so I could tip them money. They also charged me the full 10 dollars to remove 2 acrylic nails off of both of my hands.and for the amount that they're charging to have such a low quality polish is unacceptable in my opinion< /Review>< Pics>

So today was my first time here and I'm very pleased. I've never been to a salon where they got my nails exactly how I like them. They're perfect thanks to Bella. She's a nice lady and she did a really good job. The rest of the staff is also very kind and professional. 5/5 for sure.< /Text>

This nail salon is by far the worst nail salon I have ever been to they overcharged my account and when I asked about it they said it was not their problem it was the bank's problem they only fixed it when I threatened to go after them for fraud. They did an absolutely hideous job on my nails they are all bumpy and crooked not to mention my nails are not the same in size or length. They told me then that I owed $90 for my nails I was extremely upset paid the money and left if I were you and you want your nails to look flawless you should go anywhere else but here they are absolutely terrible at what they do not to mention always rushing and I agree with what the other girls said I don't see them clean their equipment very often if at all I will never go back it was my first experience and my last experience with them.</Review>

I have been using Bella & Kenny at VIP NAILS & SPA in Lodi for 11 months. I have used SO many nail salons, even when I moved out of town for 5 months, and Kenny still was the only one that could do my acrylics RIGHT and for them to actually stay on for 2-3 weeks without popping off. They are some of the sweetest, most genuine people you will meet. And they know what they are doing. (I am picky)
Their shop is beautiful and they have bomb massage chairs that even have charging ports. I highly recommend this shop!</Text>

Went in for my 1st time with my 10 year old daughter for pedicures. My guy Ben did such a great job with my foot massage he almost put me to sleep lol. He offered us drinks when we first sat in the chair and brought us both Lemonade which my daughter was excited about. Helen gave my daughter a pedicure and made it enjoyable for her and gave her exactly what she wanted. Definitely will be back to Ben and back in to try other services offered. Keep up the great work.<//Text>

I LOVED my nail extensions!! This is the first time in YEARS I have loved my nails. Technician really went above and beyond to make sure I got what I wanted

When I’m half way done with my feet they told me they couldn’t do my nails because I had to make an appointment.

Good service and staff are very friendly. They will design your nail for what you want and what you like! And very reasonable price too. I will definitely come back here where the wait time is less and the staff very friendly and customer oriented!</Review>

This is the best nail salon I've ever been to!  The people are great and their work is excellent whether you get your nails or feet done! The stay busy so that says a lot in itself.  If you ever have to wait it's well worth it.  Plus with holidays and events in the area everyone runs to to get their nails and feet done at the same time it seems! If you haven't been you need to go. I promise you'll keep going back!</Text>

<review>I was in Lodi for a weekend getaway with my best friend when she needed to get her nails done. She found this nail salon on google, and we decided to give it a try. We were both greeted warmly by the staff when we came in. Inside it is very modern and warm.

While my friend was getting her nails done, I decided to treat myself to a specialty foot soak! I would definitely recommend this treatment. It was very relaxing and their massage chairs are great. No shame here!

My friend's manicure turned out great too, she was very pleased with the result. We will both definitely be back on our next trip! Very professional and clean.< /review></record>

I have been going to since she first came to ! During those  years, I have tried different nail techs throughout . I ALWAYS end up back at . I have never had any lifting problems, she makes sure that I am totally happy. If a nail breaks, they get you in a.s.a.p to make sure you are taken care of.  goes to the convention every year, and she is always up on the new products and trends.  Always clean always friendly, and " Her reputation is on your hands @@@<//Review>

Just moved to Lodi had no idea where to get my nails done. Found VIP NAILS & SPA on google maps and I'm so glad I did! Very relaxing and a great gel manicure!! She fixed any breaks I had and took her time reshaping my nails. She has every color you could want and also powders.
I will 100% be back & refer my friends and family!!<//review>

This is my go-to place to get a mani and pedi!!! The decor is beautiful. The staff is super friendly. The nail techs speak English pretty fluently, so there's no awkwardness. I've been here several times and love everything they've done. Apparently, they are getting the dip powder soon, so I will be back to try it!<//Text>

Highly highly recommend! Was my first time doing gel mani and pedi. Bella was patient and calm, with very confident demeanor. She did not try to up-sell me, which she could have done easily. She recommended what is best for me and sure enough it turned out great. She did color blending in my nails and all my coworkers want to try that! I unusually don't write reviews but Bella is worth it!!!!!!!!!!!< /Review>

I just recently moved to Lodi and it's hard to find a nail salon that I can actually say i can trust and still do good work. I usually base almost everything on reviews and the reviews I read about this place was no exaduration. Im am beyond pleased with Ken. He was super friendly and he found the right colors I needed for what I wanted done. I will definitely be coming back especially for a pedicure 😁. Oh and did I mention, they offer wine, juice and water while getting worked on. Great place and I'm looking forward to my next visit.</text>

I use to do arcylic.....but will never go back. There is no smell, they look better, and last long! When Lisa is not available I have Vivian do them for me. Really anyone at this salon can help you and you will be happy.
The atmosphere is friendly and inviting. All new equipment too!
You have to try them out....so worth it!
I HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone. You won't be disappointed with your experience.</text></record>

I just went in for my dog's sanitary trim and it was quick.  This is an important service they just started to offer pet owners and it really keeps him from getting matted in his private parts.  No more poop entangling in his long hair.  I appreciate this service, especially for those who can't  afford a full trim.</Text>

We had trouble picking out a deshedder tool for our Husky and she was kind enough to get the manager to help us because she has a Husky also. She was also very friendly and helped us pick out the correct tool to purchase. The store was also very clean and well socked. Can't wait to visit again! Keep up the excellent work!< /Review>< Name>

<text>Even with a crazy busy store, the overall look was very clean. There weren’t items strewn haphazardly about. It was very easy to find what I needed and where. When I needed assistance, the associates were kind and informative. I was dreading the checkout with what seemed like a daunting 10-15 person line at checkout but they saw this and staffed all the registered and even had someone directing the queue to smaller lines by the registers themselves to ease congestion. 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, will go again and would definitely recommend others to go here.<//text></record></dataset><record>
<user>104023108729164313206</user><Text>I rarely give a bad review. I believe in use of google to promote business that make you happy and satisfied, but sometimes you need remind some businesses that here is still USA and costumer service and keeping promises still matters.
3 weeks ago through their website we reserved hotel for our dog at end of May, today a very rude and disrespectful lady called that they don't have any openings for that time, when  we asked that we had reservations her response was "website does not guarantee a spot for hotel" she was unapologetic and basically said it is what it is.
I don't recommend this pace at all.</Text>< Pics>

Store policy says I can return without receipt with identification.. Mr. Miguel says "you have a lot of items and I need to see the receipt"...i only had 3 smallbags of substrate a bag of fake shells, some extra air hose and tees really not much vs what I buy.

Totally disregarded store policy and refused to read his own store policy nor did he know nothing of what I was saying.  According to him.

Its okay i buy a lot of stuff and have the receipt they can sort through it. I will be reconsidering shopping at this store considering how Miguel judged me based on whatever to disregard store policy.<//Text>

<review>Good and bad things about the pet hotel. All I will say is ill never take my dog here again.. The staff was all over the place and didnt let me know my dog was sick until her 2nd occurance of diarrhea ( apparently the 3rd time they get taken to the vet.  Had I not been calling everyday it seems they would have just taken her without letting me know she wasnt doing well. They asked me if I could pick her up early because she was very nervous ( she stayed 3 nights 4 days ) and i could not i was in another state.. when I came to pick her up i waited about 10 mins for a staff member in the front who was very nice and anwsered any questions in detail about their walks and feeding... Also they told me her 4lb bag of food was all gone in her stay but I requested 2 cups once a day, but also told me many times when I called that she was not eating anyway... Which is honestly normal for her anyway, Very reasonable price. Staff was nice. But I dont trust that they are doing things properly and reaching out when its important or when your pet is struggling.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I bought a comfy cone for my dog, it was used (sold like new), full of hair, broken, smelled like pee and had a piece missing. I complained with “one of the managers” and not even said I’m sorry... Just OK. Really bad service!!! Very rude with clients!!!<//Review>

Clean and Quiet. The displays have been streamlined more since I was last there. Easy to find what you need without going down every aisle. This is essential for me since I have very little time for errand runs.</review>

Bo has been going to the Canoga Park Petsmart for 11 years since he was a pup. He has been trained, done doggy daycamp and used the hotel and is a patient at there Banfield location. This last visit they made helpful suggestions to enhance his stay and the manager Devon called me to offer a complimentary bath to help his dry skin. He looked great when I got home. As always, the staff has done a fantastic job. During these challenging times they have adjusted well with keeping all protocols in practice.</text>

I found INSTINCT cat food from rabbit here with all the varieties for the wet types & of course they also have tye dry one! I'm happy! Very convenient! So i don't need to order it online anymore (which sometimes would be delayed due to my other business or weekends when they don't deliver it until Monday).

The store is very close, clean, well stocked and the staffs are helpful & friendly! 👍< /Review>

The customer service representative on the floor Miguel was amazing. I visited on Saturday  8/15/20 during late evening hours to purchase pet supplies. I approached him to get a price check on a dog bed, he went above and beyond on getting the correct price and item I was looking for. He ensured that all items I was looking for were easily accessible to me.< /Review>

<Text>This store is amazing. I drove past 3 others to get to this one because my fearful dog loves the employees so much and has learned to socialize in doggy day camp because of their excellence!! I can’t wait to start their training programs with her also. Love these guys and shoutout to justice in boarding for being amazing with fearful dogs!!< /Text>< username>

I generally don't like going into big chain stores because you can get lost in the shuffle when it comes to customer service, but alas it doesn't happen here. I always receive a welcome when entering and have at least two associates ask me if I need any assistance while spending about 15-20 minutes at the establishment. Even though I know my way around and where things are, it's somewhat comforting that they know I'm there. Even when some associates are busy restocking, they still ask if you need any help finding something. It just shows they have pride in what they do.< /text>

The staff here are very friendly, knowledgeable, and always available to help when needed.  I come here to get foods, toys, and others things for my pets.  They have a large selections of accessories to choose from as well.  Also their aquatic department is huge with a big assortment of fresh water fishes.  I love this place.< /Text>

Front desk for pet hospital needs to be trained with phone manners and attitude check.very rude lady! We are canceling cause of her attitude and temper! I cant believe nobody been checking front desk!? 18 years of experince of management over 500 people never seen such a rude employee! She hates her job she dose not deserve her job.please do not ignore this review and do check on front desk employee and train her with people skills. Also they keep your dog over 6 hours to get 1 vaccine..not sure why? Very weird experience

OMG.  My puppy goes to day camp here. It's awesome. Everyone loves my puppy. My puppy drags me into to store and goes straight to the camp. My puppy does not even want to go home. I do half a day (6 hours) - $16.00 of full play.  My puppy does not want to leave. When I  pick him up, he wiggles out of his harness and runs back to camp. I have to put him in a shopping cart to get him in the car.
Best part is they give you a report card that tells you if he was bad, did he do #1 and #2, who he played with, was he not feeling well. Everyone knows my puppy by name - I  am Rusty's mom.
If my puppy adores them, and they adore him also. My puppy jumps all over them when we arrive. I don't  exist. How comforting is that.< /review>

I've brought my Chiweenie Duke to this Petsmart location twice now for a "Brush and Bath" package and each time the experience has been alright, but a couple of questionable things have come up that might make me think twice about returning ever again.

On this go-around, when I arrived, the curb-side pick-up situation was completely unorganized and chaotic. Customers didn't know where to go, who was next, what employee was available...it was a complete mess.  Joceline was my groomer and she was nice and all, but very robotic and not personable at all.

Joceline rushed me through the signing of the paperwork and the initial inspection of my dog that is supposed to happen when you drop your pet off never was mentioned and never happened.  She asked me to remove his collar (which I was not asked to do the previous time I brought him in, so it made me kinda uncomfortable doing this) and his harness so she could put this red leash around his neck to take him inside (also didn't happen the first time I brought him in and made me feel not too keen about leaving him there).

I asked Joceline how long the appointment would take and she advised me 3-4 hours, yet my dog was ready 1.5 hours later.  And, when I came to pick-up Duke he was just handed off to me....that's it. I didn't get a "Pawgress Report" as I did before about how the appointment went and when she saw me while bringing out another dog to its owner, she asked if I had paid yet and I said I hadn't.  She advised me to get into this extremely long line of customers to pay for his appointment or go online and pay through the app.  Since there was 1 employee and 10 customers waiting to check out, I chose to pay on the app.  It was a process because I had to add my credit card and all that, but had I been advised that I could pay in advance by Joceline when I dropped him off, then I would have had the appointment paid in full before I got there to pick him up.  When she came back out with Duke, she did not ask for proof of payment or anything, she just took the red leash off around his neck and went to go get the next pet to bring in.

My dog is basically my child, so when he is treated like a number and the customer service is bleak, it kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth about the business.  And if you offer certain services online and through the marketing campaigns you send in your emails, you should provide those services or advised the customer you cannot provide them and the reason why.

All in all, I was not too impressed the 2nd time around and most likely will look for either another PetSmart grooming location near me or another business altogether.  Based on the Yelp reviews for the surrounding PetSmart's though, it looks like I will be looking for another grooming business altogether.</text>

The worst boarding experience. I picked my dog up after a 3 night stay with a bladder infection and open sore on his leg. When I called the pets hotel after getting home and seeing this, they were unsympathetic and told me it was my fault for not understanding procedure of them only taking dogs out twice in 24 hours, even though over the phone the reservation desk told me that my dog would be able to go the bathroom multiple times during the day. Now I have a vet bill and sick dog peeing blood.. who had zero health issues going into his stay.</text>

Went in hoping to get my dogs nails trimmed.  Was greeted very professionally by staff.  I didn’t have to wait long and was assisted by Karen.  They were very accommodating and was very satisfied with service.  Thanks we will continue to return for all our dogs needs ☺️<//text>

That was very helpful pointed me in the right direction and help me find everything that I need super educated on everything I needed to know about my pets from my dog to my parakeet. One thing I have been able to utilize is renting their Pee cleaner for carpets. Whenever my dog honey has an accident which is rarely I come here to rent the carpet. Which is very affordable and makes my house smell great.</Text>

I'm not even sure if this place is open anymore but I had taken a couple of my dogs there and they had a lot of fun... I had a special trainer that was leading smell classes and she has passed on unfortunately that's another reason I don't know what's going on or if that location is even still active<//Text>

Got everything we needed for our pup! And it was his first trip out of the house now that he has all his puppy shots!
The store was so clean and so great with so many toys, treats, supplies, and etc to chose from
he even got to pick out his own toy! ♡<//Text>

<name>Veronica Mg<//name><Review>My dog stayed for two days at Canoga park location. My experience was terrible, when I arrived the front desk person seemed sleepy and careless. She had no clue who I was even when she asked my dog name twice, she should have asked for the last name first. She confused my dog with another dog and she checked in for a day camp instead of on-boarding. When I though we finalized all paperwork she mentioned I should pick up my dog before 7pm and I realized the confused us with someone else. This made me loose 30 minutes when I had to catch a flight. When I picked my dog, they were so busy and you can tell overflowed with the number of pets that it took them 25 minutes to bring my dog to the front desk. They overcharged me and the worse part is that my dog was crying when he saw me. He wanted to get out of there immediately. He pooped 3 times like if he was never taken outside. For all the money they charged me I doubted they actually took care of him the way they said. No customer service at all...< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Best for me is their grooming department which we use for our dog for the past few years.
The service is great, friendly and our dog just love to go there.
Only minus is price, I wish they had some discount or just a bit cheaper.
Parking is easy and there is grass outside which is bonus.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

We love PetSmart. We boarded our dog here for the weekend at the hotel. Staff was very helpful answering questions prior to our reservation. They welcomed our dog and myself very warmly. Check-in was quick and efficient and they logged everything we brought for a dog. We had the dog in Doggie Daycare and some one-on-one play time. We called twice to check on our dogs and the staff was very nice taking time to update us on what she was doing. When we came to pick her up Sunday afternoon she was enjoying play with other dogs. She got into the car promptly fell asleep and slept most of the rest of the day. She was very happy when we picked her up and obviously had a good time from her stay at the pet hotel.< /review>

Just adopted this beautiful 10yr old pit from the local Humane Society and had to get him totally fitted out for his new digs. As with all my previous dogs, I spent way too much but, they had EVERYTHING!!!<//review>

I've been taking my dog here for about 5yrs. The pet hotel is great! But over the past year or so the groomers take almost 5hrs, could never get my dogs hair cut right. It's not like I'm asking for anything crazy, he's been getting the same exact hair style the entire time. I always have to ask them to fix it, but even then I end up having to fix it myself at home. Over priced for bad service! WOULD definitely NOT RECOMMEND the groomers at this location!!!</Review>

I signed up for training and the trainer Jennifer is really wonderful!  Also the groomers were excellent too because not only were did they do a great job with my puppy, they also explained to me how I can save money.  Every time I have gone here all the staff have been very helpful.  The products are pricey, but it's all worth it!</Text>

<Review>Pet Hotel - I do not recommend.
I never do reviews but felt this one was important.  Wish I could say this was great experience, however from the time we arrived to now as I am writing this post, I cannot recommend the Canoga Park location.

First, when we arrived, the staff was not friendly and do not know how to deliver a pleasant message regarding all the "policies" about a pet staying at their hotel.  I rented a suite for my 2 dogs, and they have strict rules that each dog can only have one personal item.  Ok, whatever.

We paid for camp days, along with the suite because we do spoil our fur babies .  I made sure they had their own food, treats etc.

Every time I would call to check in, I would be put on hold several times before someone would actually get on the line from the pet hotel.  The last call the store manager finally helped me...this took over 25 minute, but I did appreciate that she made the effort.

When we picked them up they were just "off".  Physically and emotionally. Both dogs were upset, and just wanted to get out.  One of my dogs cried all the way home.  I just chalked I up to the fact we rarely board our dogs, and they would settle back in.  However, this really was not the case.

One of dogs had major diarrhea that lasted about a week. Not sure if they even fed our food to them or some other food they are not used to.

Also, one of dogs had to be taken into the vet for leg injury within about 2 days of picking her up.  This cost me $130, but thankfully nothing major.  I can't say for sure how this my have happened, but it was coincidental with the stay.

Approximately 10 days later, one of my dogs developed kennel cough.  Our dogs are not exposed to other dogs, other than when they were boarded. So, now we are dealing with this.

All this said, I did have great experience at the Northridge location.  Unfortunately, they did not have a suite available wen we needed to book for our trip.

Hope I helps other dog owners when deciding on where to board there pets.  I know we will not be returning to the Conga Park location.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Well, it is a pet store. It is the other corporate pet store to Petco. As such, it is unremarkable. However, the staff are fairly friendly and the store is well organized making things easy to find. One large side is devoted mostly to dogs, the other side goes to cats and shares room with rodents. Their are products for fish and birds as well. Pricing is about average in part because being something of a monopoly, competition is sparse. However, it is a large store and should likely meet your pet needs.<//review>

Communication was atrocious. They didn't tell me that they wouldn't let my Cane Corsos play with other dogs because of their breed (Las Vegas store let them play with other dogs despite this "corporate policy") ,heyh tto stay in separate rooms the whole day, and when I called 30 min before picking them up and asked if they had the baths I asked them to do they said yes, but it was not done when I got there. They did give a good review of the dogs for eating and bathroom info, but never taking my dogs there ever again.</text>

<Review>Oliver (my special need cat) wants to give Jamie, Brandyann & staff ...4-paws & a tail up!! At first, I thought the staff remembered Oliver by name cause there ain't too many cats that go kibble shopping.  On a busy weekend, I noticed that the staff actually knew the names of many of the regular furball shoppers.

It really means a lot to me that they'd call him Oliver by name with a warm welcome, and friendly check-out, cause Jamie and Brandyann would let him ride the conveyor belt w/the kibbles he's buying.

Jamie & Brandyann has really made Oliver's kibble shopping experience at PetSmart awesome!!  Oliver even thinks he's the big furball that gets to shop w/the big dogs.<//Review>< pics>

<name>sivan cohen</name>< review>
I had an appointment with Dr. Erez Gueta.
My pet had a skin issue that I am not sure until now what caused the reaction, the Dr took notes but didn’t bother to even listen to me or try to explain how this reaction can accrue.
Then I informed him that I would like to vaccinate my dog for rabies and that he had a bad reaction to vaccine in the past (that was 4 years ago), since then and prior to my visit at the clinic I’ve consulted with close to 10 different veterinarians on what will be the procedure in a case like that, they all said that the pet have to get a Benadryl shot 15 minutes prior to the vaccine shot and that I will have to watch my pet and make sure he doesn’t get any reaction.
Dr. Gueta insisted that my dog has to be hospitalized and connected to an IV in order to get the rabies (which will add another $150 to my bill), when I said I don’t think it is necessary, he refused to treat my dog and informed me that we are done with the visit.
I will never visit this hospital again!!!
The Dr was rude and full of attitude, taking care of pets is definitely not the right job for him.</review>

Awful experience there.  My 5 yr old daughter tripped on some loose blanket they used for dog adoptions, hurt her hip. I told cashier what happened, heavy set white lady stood there stone faced did not respond, no help, no concern, no sympathy.  If it was a dog that got hurt they would be all over it,  a little kid gets hurt no one cares. I got upset asked for manager,  told him to fix loose blanket and secure it, said he would and didn't. Never shopping there again.< /review>

<text>Will not be returning to this petsmart again!
I purchased a 6 week beginners puppy training class. I attended to 2 of there classes which is basic stuff you can research online about how to train the basics to your dog. The trainer missed twice and the second time she did not notify people that she would be missing class. I wasn't satisfied with the classes and when I went to get a refund the manager (Miguel) had nothing but excuses and lies about how he couldn't do the refund and that I needed to go thru the trainer to get my refund.He also mentioned the trainer(Jennifer) had called and left a voice mail to everyone that went that day for the 3rd class that she wouldn't be going in that day but everyone was still there waiting. Why would they still show up if she really did notify people about her missing!? Since she had missed that day I was asking for my money back.He told me to come back tomorrow cause she would be there. I went back the next day and what a surprise she wasn't there again but the manager (Miguel) was able to only give me part of my money back because I had already attended 2 classes which is not true your entitled to receive a full money back regardless if you still went to 2 classes. I called petsmart customer service and they told me they should be able to give me my full money back, like any other product even if you use it and you open it your still able to get your full money back for it so why would this situation be different. Customer service was able to issue me a gift card for the rest of my money so it worked out, but I'm most definitely not returning to this petsmart again, staff is real shady there and especially the manager there only looking out for what's best for them not the customer. I wouldnt even give them 1 star. Especially the manager(Miguel) the guy seem like he couldn't even keep his story or guidelines straight, it was too obvious he was throwing me every excuse he could to not give me my refund. Wouldn't recommend this store location to anyone, management is really poor!!<//text>< pictures>

<Text>A number 1, really affordable pricing for pet training. 8 weeks for a little over $100 bucks with friendly and experienced trainers.  I am definitely coming back for training and hopefully reach higher levels with my dog. Groomers are friendly and services are also reasonably priced. They have a vet and dog hotel/daycare facilities<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1282593650137</date>< Name>

They always have a great deal for my kitties, and I enjoy coming here.  They are helpful when you need it and aren't all in your face when you don't.  Try them out, I enjoy them.</Review>

Not a big selection really, of living creatures. Adequate in most everything else. Need more reptiles, rodents, amphibians, and fish. Some Kool aquariums in there. Maybe they were just about to restock. Ehhh<//text>

I love Petsmart, but it's getting really pricey... Even when you buy their own name brand...

Update:
This comment is in regards to the grooming services. If you have time to waste, come to this groomer. But you will not get your appointment with the groomer you scheduled with, nor will you be notified that someone else will work on your dog.

And if you are indecisive about what you want done, and although you made an appointment previously, if the groomer is delicate and has no patience nor the knowledge to explain the services, then you will be out of luck, and they'll move your appointment to a more convenient time for them and not for you... All this, with the pre-set appointment already scheduled.

This happened to me, and the only reason I didn't know exactly what to get done for my dog was because, two days previous, I had called and spoken to someone in the grooming salon and they suggested that I just make the appointment and when I came in, to have my groomer help me make a decision...

It completely worked against me and they inconvenienced me by making my appointment even later.< /text>

I really like going to this PetSmart even though it isn't the closest PetSmart to me I go out of my way and travel a bit more to go to this one. They have plenty of neat things for my pets Lucy (Tuxedo Kitten) and Squirtle (Red Eared Slider Turtle) from high-quality grain-free cat food including dry-freeze with many different brands to choose from to large goldfish, superworms, crickets, freshwater canned shrimp to freeze-dried. Everything is also priced relatively well and very easy to find. The employees are also very helpful and are glad to answer any question I have. Compared to other PetSmart chain stores I would rather go out of my way to shop at this store. I highly recommend this PetSmart to anyone!</text>

Please don't ever leave your babies here for board nor day camp. I left my pup for 2 nights. When I picked him up terrible service provided by the staff, they were super rude and unhappy to be working there, they took forever to bring him out. When they did the person was super rude and careless. I did not realize up until I was in my car that my pup was covered with poop all over (he is a chocolate Labradoodle). The smell was unbearable as you can all probably imagine. When I called them back all they did was say "sorry". But this is unacceptable! They did not even try to compensate nor care about the severity of this matter. The receptionist only said, "I guess they forgot to clean him last night." Last night?! I highly doubt they clean them at all! So please don't leave your babies here it's a health hazard.< /Text>< resp>

While I enjoy buying products and clothes for my 7 pound Chihuahua there because the front of the house staff is awesome and their selection is superb, I will NEVER again have her groomed there. Last time they lost her because no one realised she was in a dryer.</Review>

I don't know what happened to my dog at the grooming services. I have never seen him act so weird. He was very scared and didn't act like himself.

He did not have any cuts on him but when I came to pick him up he was not a happy dog like he usually is. Makes me sad</Text>

I took my dog here to get washed and cut and when I picked him up the groomer looked at me like I was a villain and proceeded to tell me my dog had a huge hotspot under his arm and needed to be taken to the vet for it, I looked under his arms after I got home and he had no hotspot, they had cut his hair so short his skin was raw under both of his arms and on a few other spots on his body. I am so angry with the service. I will never bring my dog here again!<//Review>

If you love your dog/cat please look elsewhere when looking to board your pet.  I dropped my dog on 7/17/16 to get groomed and to stay until 7/20/16 with her EAR medication and they lost her medicine and were giving her some other dogs medication.

Upon picking her up my wife was told that they COULD NOT find her medicine (Gentizol) and had no logical reason as to why. I then called and asked to speak to the boarding manager (Rochelle) who had no explanation and I was forwarded to the store manager (Mark).  After a minute of saying they would refund my money for the boarding, they magically found her medicine in "some drawer."

When I got to the store the medicine they gave me WAS NOT the medicine I left for my dog, but was some eye medication (Genteal) they said they had been given her and still had no expatiation to were her medicine was.

I was told that they keep medicine in a room that is locked and only the supervisor can get into it, but when I was there they went in and out of a drawer that was filled with medicine in no type of order in the front lobby.

My poor dog went without medicine for 4 days, some other dog went without their medicine or was given my dogs medicine for those days.  UNBELIEVABLE.

THANK GOD its wasn't heart medication or anything else as my dog is elderly.

Now I have to take my dog to the Vet to make sure she is fine and buy new medicine as I want nothing to do with PETSMART in the future.

I noticed that this location has mixed reviews.  I'm not sure if the management or staff has changed since then but I have never dealt with a more incompetent group of individuals and something should definitely be done.

When they called my wife after I left I was referred to as "some guy" even though we're married and I dropped off the dog.  They also said they loved playing with him and mentioned how good he was when giving him the medicine even though she is a GIRL.

My dog was also scheduled to get groomed before the boarding so she would be clean and comfy while we were away, but they decided it was best to do it right before we came back.  We picked her up around 4:30PM and they had to get her from the groomers side where she had been waiting since 10AM.

Never have I been more upset.  Completely unacceptable Petsmart.

If you love your pet, you've been warned.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Just picked up my dog yesterday and now he is sick. We dropped him off with a little more than 5 days (leng th of stay) worth of his dog food and snacks because he has a very sensitive stomach. They didnt give him any of the food we brought even though they confirmed it when we scheduled him and when we dropped him off. Now he's not feeling well. We also had him scheduled for a doctors appointment at banfield during his stay- confirmed the schedule with both the hospital and pet hotel to be picked up since it's in the same pet smart. I received an email saying he missed his appointment which I guess doesn't matter anymore since I have to take him to the doctors now.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<name>Keren Conner< /name><time>1465655756888< /time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>We have been customers of the Canoga Park store for 6 1/2 years. We began.with the puppy school, which was extraordinary. The family and puppy learn how to correctly live and work together. Hitting a dog with rolled newspaper is incorrect! The 6 week course concluded with a test, followed by a graduation.  It was worth the $100. Alex Pappas, who was her trainer, is now the head of training for all stores! To this day, our dog has retained her training. The doggie day camp is a controlled, safe and secure environment for all day play with dogs of the same size and no vicious breeds commingled. Our girl loves to go to doggie day camp! After each visit to day camp, a "Pawgress Report" is provided explaining how her day was & who she played with. It is always fun to hear about her experience! The Pet Hotel provides excellent boarding with the same safety & security. We recommend highly for the July 4th holiday. Our dog is very happy & well socialized. We will be forever grateful! From the family of Sushi W.  We give Petsmart A+++++!<//Review>< pictures>

Don't be late for your appointment, otherwise you'll wait for an hour .Also the Indian vet tried to make us come in earlier than our appointment and when we said we couldn't, he intentionally hurt our dog by clipping her nails too short and made her bleed and cry and charged us $12 bucks! Don't go to that guy ever! Our dog was tramatized!<//text>

<text>I Have Learned from the mgr. who was very polite about the subject not being able to buy a stand 36L 18W 29H which is being sold in the valencia store with the aquarium . which is fine but I didnt need the aquarium. I asked the mgr. did he sell stands in the box to customers Yes he did other sizes fine I said can  I order the product and pick it up when it arrives. he said I cant they dont carry that size  at this store. I was  wow that is surprising to hear A large chain store to refuse me the right  to buy a product from them. the young man that told me this was very nice about this problem  and he couldnt  help me with this. in other words if  you didnt  buy the aquarium with the stand I wonder if I wanted to buy the aquarium they were selling in velencia with the stand and would the let me order just the aquarium ??? price never came up about the product  my age is 83 yrs. and I try to buy as much product as I can so I dont have to travel to much at my age. I live close to petsmart canoga park. but they dont want me to buy from them. OH Well God Bless Them Anyway Happy New Year .</text></record></dataset><record>

It's a shame that it doesn't matter which department you visit at this location, all the employees are rude and like they hate working here, they should be trained as far customer service go they have no manners or know what they are talking about when asked for recommendations</text>

<Review>Came here to have my aunts dog euthanized and while the store itself is not a bad place to shop for your pets, this review was mostly based off of one of the vet techs who insisted on constantly telling us the pricing of the euthanasia multiple times throughout the entire process, regardless of how much me and my family members were mourning.<//Review>< Resp>
