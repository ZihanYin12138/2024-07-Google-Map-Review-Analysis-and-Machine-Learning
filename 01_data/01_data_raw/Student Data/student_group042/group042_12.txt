<Text>It was our very first escape room and we had the best time. I took my boyfriend for his birthday. The staff was very friendly and made us all feel very comfortable. The room we did was a challenge and I’m excited to try the others! 10/10 would recommend. We will be back!<//Text>< pictures>

Ive been here two times, and it’s been an amazing time. However, the best part is the people who work there. They are so freaking kind and understanding. They help guide your decisions on what you should play, and do WHATEVER it takes to make sure that you have a good time. They treat you with respect and make it so you have a great time! The rooms are amazing as well. The stranger things room was so damn fun, and we had a blast. The bomb one was very hard and while we failed, it was still such a great time. If you’re on the fence about doing one, or about this place because it’s in Visalia and not a big city, don’t be!!! This is an amazing place to experience all the fun of escape rooms, and any questions you have I’m sure the people who work there will be happy to answer them!<//text>< Pics>

Tried out the Downside Up room and that was so much fun. The person that was helping up was on point with a few tips for us. Cannot wait to try out some of the other rooms available at this location. Such a great addition to Visalia. Much better than the other company that tried to open an escape room.<//review>

<review>Took on downside up room as a group of 2. Were able to make it through the room fairly easily because we have done multiple escape rooms in the past. Clues were clever and the room was set up very well for a one room escape room. After we finished, the game master told us that they had more challenging rooms so we decided to do the c4 room. Again as a group of two, this one was very tricky and we completed it just under the time limit. Again, I like how the clues are laid out. Some of the clues are very slick and and the room / clue flow made sense and was really fun.

If you have no experience or lots of experience with escape rooms, you should visit cleVR. We had a great time and would recommend to all.<//review>< pics>

Great fun activity to do with the husband as a date. Love how the room had a theme similar to Stranger Things. We did get stuck a couple of times, so thanks for the hints. Definitely need more than 2 people I think in order to be successful. But ultimately we had fun. Thanks for an awesome experience.< /text>

My husband and I did the Atlantis room and it was such a blast! We BARELY finished with 8 minutes to spare! It was challenging but not too frustrating- a perfect combination. David was an amazing host and chatted with us after about the VR features they have. 100% recommend this place!<//text>

I had so much fun! Even made it to the newspaper for them!! Just remember, especially if youre in the Atlantis room, you're NOT at the end until the tv tells you you've completed the room! If the TV hasnt said you've completed it, then KEEP GOING! Learn from our mistakes! The staff is so very nice and made it fun. We will definitely be returning (Visalia location)<//Text>

<text>I had an absolute blast at CleVR Escape with my family. With the craziness of everything right now, it was really a great way to spend the evening. Not only was the room decorated amazingly, the entire family ( ages 50-16) was entertained, stumped, and left in giggles at times. It wasn’t easy, but WE DID IT!! I will definitely be going back, and I really hope we get to see a CleVR Escape in Visalia soon!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1608737362473, 'text': 'Thanks for the review!

This place is so much FUN! From their awesome VR games to incredible escape rooms, it's perfect for your friends and family.

We did both of their escape rooms and had a blast. Downside Up was such a cool theme, and Platform C4 was a tough challenge without being frustrating. Overall, there was clearly a lot of thought put into the rooms, and it shows.

I only wish they had even more rooms!! Highly recommend.</Text>

We did the Escape Atlantis room as a family of 6. We had a lot of fun!!! Everything was unique and really used our brains. We will definitely be back. The owner did really well with Covid times, everything was sanitized (including our hands before starting).< /review>

Another great escape! Enjoyed visiting Clevr Escape again this evening. Friendly staff and a very clean establishment.  They are working hard to keep their customers safe and you can tell.</review>

Even though we lost miserably, It was a lot of fun! :) It was definitely addictive and Im ready to go back for more. The owner was very friendly and informative. The rooms have been kept clean, and everything was sanitary.< /Review>

Played their newest room Lost Treasure of Atlantis and it was amazing!! 🙌🏼 the room was well put together and very intricate. The difficulty level was not too hard but not easy either. I would definitely recommend to any escapers looking for a cool room to play. My team and I won with 8 minutes to spare 😎 we will definitely come back and play another room! Thanks guys for such an amazing experience 😊<//text>

One of the best escape rooms to visit! The rooms I've been in had nice details and the puzzles were sometimes tough that my friends had to communicate their ideas. Its definitely one of the best ways to bond.< /text>

<text>We played 2 of their rooms and the VR room so far and seriously LOVE this place. The puzzles are amazing and the owner is awesome. The puzzles for the bomb room require a lot of communication and the downside up room has augmented reality, which is a cool twist that I have never seen in an escape room before. You can tell that the game designer really put a lot of thought into the puzzles and wants to create something new and different. They also have virtual reality escape rooms and an arcade which is always fun. My friends couldnt stop talking about how weird it was seeing and moving their hands in the VR world vs. real life. Overall, we had a lot of fun! Great experience!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJatZadvZmA1IBX91SpO7LabpnKKyGEWtwrpc9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1584239489642, 'text': 'You are so kind!

We enjoyed Platform C4 so much we had to do Downside Up immediately after!  The rooms are fantastic and the puzzles are the right amount of challenging.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  Remember that when you go here, it's our record you're trying to beat!  CVG!</Text>

The virtual reality escape room was awesome! My boys (ages 7&9) loved it and we had so much fun as a family doing it together. It was my first experience with virtual reality and with escape rooms. We will definitely go back and do it again. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. I strongly recommend!< /Text>

We did the platform c4, and were so pleased that the puzzles were difficult. It was a really great team building exercise as it required communication through a small vent. The story telling could have been more incorporated, but overall, it was one of my favorite escape room experiences.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>This escape room was so fun and unique! We played the Downside Up room and had a blast. It used alternate reality, which I had never seen in an escape room before. The puzzles were well thought out, and even though we didn't solve them in quite the right order, we beat the clock and had a great time. We can't wait to go back and play the rooms that use virtual reality. I highly recommend checking this place out!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1560897957651, 'text': 'Thanks Elizabeth, so glad you had a blast!'}< /response>< gmap_id>

Hands down an awesome experience. Went through the downside up with some friends and enjoyed every minute.
The owner was incredibly kind and welcoming and the puzzles and stories were engaging, multi dimensional, and challenging.
Definitely worth visiting!</Text>

Such an amazing experience, we have done each of their escape rooms and have had a blast doing each. However, tonight we tried their Virtual Reality experience, and it was INCREDIBLE!! Didn't know exactly what to expect, and I was blown away. The owners are always so helpful and friendly. We would recommend any and all of their escape room experiences!!< /Text>

<text>Tried this place out and did the "city of atlantis" ... loved it.. the owner is SUPER FREINDLY you can tell HOW MUCH he loves being there... never been to an escape room where things were more tech savvy !!  And the clues (if you need it) are helpful.. the decorations are awesome visually in this room.. alot of work put into this room visually... creativeness is awesome!!! Will definitely come back and try the rest of the escape rooms!! We died but was on the very last clue to open the "prize" but definitely above medium level if that helps .. TRY THEM!!!<//text>< pictures>

CleVR Escape does an amazing service of giving such an immersive and diverse experience of escape rooms. Both of the the rooms I’ve played had really good puzzles that kept me engaged and the story and themes of the room were spot on. Also tried out one of the VR escape rooms and was blown away. Literally was transported to a different time and place and had a blast with friends. So looking forward to going back and having fun. Thank you CleVR Escape for an awesome time. You should definitely be proud of the amazing experience you’ve created.< /Review>

Awesome idea and great employees/owners. The guys there are so friendly and like to get feedback from patrons. I can't wait until they start with monthly membership plans. Hopefully by summer break so the kids will have something to do other than the usual nothing that this town has to offer. I absolutely recommend this place to all ages and skill levels across the board!<//Text>

We were a group of four, grandma, uncle, niece and friend so all age groups were present.  We had a blast and can’t wait to try the rest of the events.  Can’t say enough to express how challenging and fun the locked room was, try it and see how fast you can exit the locked room........</review>

We have been to some escape rooms where some clues could be like “how is anyone supposed to get that??” We had so much fun. The other dimension part of this game is so unique and so much fun! As well as the story line. Matt was our game master and he was great! We finished it with only 2 mins to spare! But we enjoyed the whole 58 minutes. The briefing in the end was so thorough. We could really see how passionate he is about this and this makes the experience so much more memorable. Thank you!! We will def be back to do the other one! We really recommend this escape room. :)< /text>< Pics>

This was our first Escape Room and this was such an amazing experience!! The place was clean and the customer service was great!! The room and puzzles were fun and really engaging for all ages. We are definitely going back to do their second room. So glad we finally have a place like this in Tulare, I recommended a visit to Unreal Game, you won't regret it!!< /Review>

Their VR escape rooms are pretty neat! Puts you in a virtual experience unlike anything else you could experience. And in the Downside Up room, you get to use phones to scan around the room, which also sets them apart from other rooms I have experienced. If you're looking for something fun and different to do, go try Unreal Games! The staff is super friendly too!< /Text>< pictures>

Tulare may not have a whole lot to do, but if you're looking for something fun definitely visit Clevr Escape!! The owners are super friendly and helpful. It is an excellent experience and they are extremely reasonable with their prices. Try it once and you'll be anxious to return. We did platform C4; It was definitely challenging, but it was a blast.<//text>

Had a blast doing both of their escape rooms, as well as the VR escape room. The puzzles are some of the best I've done. Plateform C4 really tests your teamwork and communication skills in a fun, ingenues way. The Downside Up utilized some cool AR technology laced on-top of traditional escape room puzzles. The VR escape experiences were also amazing. I really enjoyed the puzzles the media allows you to do. The owners are extremely friendly and really care about the art of the escape room. I would highly suggest trying any or all of these rooms out.< /text>

We had a blast with the VR arcade. We played for an hour left and came back 5 minutes later because we all wanted another turn. The workers are super friendly and just as into the games as us.  Plan to be back soon.<//review>

That was incredible! The staff were wonderfully friendly, witty, and funny and explained everything perfectly.
The room we did was the "Escape the Lost Pyramid" VR adventure. It was our first time doing an escape room or a VR experience. Both did NOT disappoint! It feels so realistic and thrilling! We managed to beat the room in about 45 minutes. (There were two of us that played, and we both enjoy video games and puzzles, so I'm sure that helped.)
Great job, Unreal Escape!!!</Review>

This was my 5th escape room. My friends and I did the downside up And it was different than the ones I've done. Super cool and creative. Hands down the best one I've done so far. Can't wait to go back for the other ones< /review>

<Text>We had so much fun. This was my 4th escape room and it had the best technology. A surprisingly great experience. We are so lucky to have this in tulare. We did Down Side Up and cant wait to do the others. I have heard the virtual reality escape room is even better.<//Text>< Pictures>

Walked in just to check prices, and ended up staying 30mins playing the VR set! This place is amazing, and I highly recommend coming here. I know I’ll be back to do the escape room very soon!! ☺️<//Review>

K.C. Bolton always does an amazing job getting us up to speed on the most recent changes in tax law and cares enough to find ALL of the credits and deductions we qualify for annually.
Before going to Bolton Bookkeeping I would get my taxes done at the strip-mall preparers and ended up needing legal help later because of their inexperience.
Having our own bookkeeper is a step up in life. Our returns are larger now, as well.< /text>

I have been using this company for over 20 years. KC has always taken care of me with my taxes. I have never had any trouble with the IRS and she has always been able to do more than just taxes. She helps me through out the year with keeping me on track for the best results for the year. I would highly recommend Bolton Tax Service.< /Text>

I've had the pleasure of knowing KC for several years. She is honest, compassionate (when I screw up!), and her prices are reasonable. I would recommend her to anyone needing bookkeeping and/or tax service.< /Text>

Used to pay $500 to do my taxes that they messed up on and I owed the federal government money!! $1900!! And im a single mom!!  It was a simple thing!! Something I paid way too much to have to then suffer the consequences.  KC has been very thorough,  amazingly graceful in helping me and charges less then half the cost.  That's amazing!!!< /text>

Now i know every one who shops at this place has their own experience with their own gripes, with that said  i have my own story to tell. It is all about customer service. Forget about the stuff they carry . We all know it a gamble from the start so good or bad that part is all on us.
Back to customer service this place is top notch in helping me out in a situation that most places would push back with what i claimed to have taken place  have in mind i had proof for what i said what happened and not even one bit of backlash the assistent  manager the tall guy wish I knew his name he always there  when I'm there shopping . He was the nicest person  took care of my problem  not even try to push back  on the spot I was satisfied and happy to be a loyal patron of this liquidator .
Thanks Bulldogs for all you do

<Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><text>This place is absolutely terrible to shop in. I checked the website on my computer at home to determine if there was something there I wanted to buy. I found a generator and tried to call about the availability however no one answers the phone. So I decided to go and see the place. Of course the generator that was advertised on their website is not available. I talked to one of the associates and ask him if he had an inventory listing of the products they have on hand. He told me no they do not and they do not log items into the computer as they come in. The bottom line they do not know what they have in the store you just have to go there and roam around until you find something you like. I would rate this place as a POS.

until today I would have given this place for stars but the pricing system has been redone and it does not work paying $200 for something that cost $300 brand new not knowing if it even works does not seem like a good deal to me too many times previously have I gotten something home excited to play with it only to find that an essential piece is missing or it just flat out doesn't work but at the price that cost in the end it was always worth it because I could bye many things and usually the Lost per gain was worth it not always but often enough I found myself paying typically $300 per trip and now they want $300 per item almost I strongly recommend finding a coupon online and purchasing your item brand new opposed to coming here and playing Russian roulette with your money<//text>

<text>Messy, extremely overpriced, broken, dirty, disgusting merchandise. There's no way their prices are "discounted". I compared and half the stuff they're selling prices similarly OR LESS on Amazon or at Walmart/Target. If you're looking for lower prices, there's better priced and cleaner/nicer/newer stuff on Craigslist. Extremely disappointed, no need to visit again.</text><rating>1< /rating><time>1602023252236</time>< user>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Whats the point of going to this store to buy items when the people in charge of cleaning the store is taking merchandise for themselves. You dont go to a walmart or target and have the very same employees hoarding merchandise for themselves. Makes since why they have a mantel covering their carts, for all the merch they keep for themselves.<//review>< pictures>

Bulldog!! I used to go every other day to this place, since 2017, buying stuff and getting good deals sometimes broken items that at the end Bulldog’s was exchanging with no hesitation. Now June 2019, the staff treat you like they don’t need from you, they treat you like you’re there to ask for a favor instead of recognize you give them a check for their families, for example some cashiers have been so impolite; you have to like them and be like their close friend to give a good deal or good service!  Now they don’t want any returned merchandise, they will tell you, not to return anything at all, because they are giving you a good deal already, I didn’t agree to this and now those guys do all possible to make my shopping experience a nightmare suddenly telling you Back Off!! when trying to get products, only a few other employees will give a real customer service and have been helpful and know the importance of serving you as customer..Bulldog! Customers are always First, and always agree to us, is one of the rules for a successful business.. Still taking this matter to the appropriate owners, so much stuff in my possession that is broken and can’t just do nothing about it, California laws are clear, money back or exchange products..and the most important, do not discriminate against for race or ethnicity..I don’t hide,  this is my Real account I’m a profesional and educated by the best Mentors in USA, I know 100% what is to serve a customer.. Bulldog you must train your people to respect, provide value, and learn how to Serve customers! 🔟❌💪🏼👊🏼< /text>

Varying selection of goods that are way cheaper than retail. I have started to save a good amount of money because I now shop here regularly. You have to go consistently to keep up with the new product they get.< /text>

A year or two ago I would have given them 5 stars but for the last year my experiences have been very unimpressive and worse.  Their merchandise has been really second rate and their prices have gone up dramatically.  On the rare occasion I find something I want it almost always is cheaper online in new condition compared to torn, dented and stained condition at BullDog.   A fair amount of their stock comes from items which don't sell on Amazon by FBA (third party) sellers who ask Amazon to "destroy" their merchandise to avoid inventory fees.  I do agree that their employees are very pleasant.<//review>

<Review>First time buyer at this location. Let me start of by saying , good customer service. Before the store opened and while I was waiting outside I spoke to a few customers about what type of pallet have they bought and their experience. They all told me the same thing. Its all TRASH ! I should of listen to them but I took my chances and literally that's what I got . I can't believe what I found in the pallet, empty Gatorade bottles, empty boxes and some with trash in them, random left over stuff from other things and most of the stuff was either broken or missing parts. It was a big disappointment knowing that I got ripped off. If the store doesn't have the merchandise to fill a pallet don't throw trash in it and rip people off. I don't recommend this place at all and I would never waste my time going there again.</Review>< userid>

Great massage. They actually get in there and get the knots out.  Not the superficial stuff you get at other places. And you definitely can’t beat the price.  The $25 “foot” massage is actually a full body massage with clothes on and a little extra attention on your feet.  This place does not disappoint.< /text>

<review>I’ve been to this place twice with my girlfriend in a couple massage Session in a private room and both of the time we heard from next-room sounded like someone having sex. At first time I thought maybe someone getting a good massage. But what is the likelihood of hearing that again? We had to abort our message in the middle because my girlfriend could not relax and never wants to go to this place ever again.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Very good for the price.  Most of the massage therapists are unable to speak English besides to say to massage harder or softer.  Any special areas of concern have to basically be communicated up front through the front person.  So long as you like the routine that they do it is great.  The turnover on massage therapists occurs probably every 2 to 5 months.  The "foot" massage is whole body but with your clothes on.  "Combo" is same but you take your shirt off and they do more focus on the back.  I haven't tried full body.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Response>None</Response><review>Got a message from one of the men who works there. He doesn't know what he is doing. He pushed so hard on back that I suffered an injury to my rib cage. It's been 1 week since my injury, I have a doctor apt to get an x-ray this week to see if one of my ribs are broken or out of place. I'll update this review after my apt.

We called for a 7 pm appointment, for two, and they were able to get us in. I am so thankful, as is my husband.
They are super professional and worked out all the kinks and crunchies. I feel goooood.
I have already booked my next appointment. I'm thinking that this should be as standard as my mani/pedi.< /review>

< Review>
Did not like this place AT ALL!   The whole office staff and therapists baby talk down to you and care only about money and their time, not mine!   Also, the equipment is Jurassic old!  For the amount of money they make the exercise equipment needs ALL upgrading!

Beware, if you go to any hospital or any other “therapy” during you scheduled sessions, don’t tell them.  If they find out they will drop you like a hot rock, since these people are greedy and are afraid the insurance money will dry up!  They dropped us with some sessions left, and I am betting they got paid for them.  😡😡🤬

You are better off getting books on physical therapy and going to a gym which has way newer equipment and a trained staff that charges normal prices.   These over paid Reischl clowns will rush your sessions and short you time if they can!  Physical therapy is yet another corrupt racket that needs reforming in the healthcare system.  It is ALL broken!< /Review>

<Date>1605211518080</Date><text>I was lucky enough to be paired with Dr. Ashley Wallace, and I can't recommend her highly enough! She is extremely knowledgeable about her work. She patiently answered all my many questions, enabling me to understand my situation and how she felt she could help me improve.  After only a few sessions, my neck feels better than it has in years! The chronic pain has diminished, my range of movement has improved, and I no longer feel I will have to just "gut it out." Instead, I feel hopeful that the progress I am making under the guidance of Dr. Wallace will continue.< /text></record>

Went there when my doctor referred me. I thought oh boy. Here we go again.  But I gotta be honest. Their wonderful, all of them! They do wonders for
the body! I feel so much better dice I've  been going there. I highly recommend this place to
Everyone! Not much else I can say. Except if you go there and your turning left onto willow.  Get in left hand lane. Get in the second turn area and go towards the back. They will be on the left hand side.<//review>

The good thing is, if you have an appointment there is practically no wait time. It features private treatment rooms and a big, equipped room for exercise.< /text>< pictures>

I came in here after lamenting online about not getting the haircut I want at several salons, the beauty school etc. I had two guys tell me to go to a black barber and they'd set me up right.

I went into Mike's and Dania listened to what I wanted, my complaints about how hard it apparently is for a girl to get a mohawk, and she put me in her chair.

She did a fantastic job! Not only do I love my hair again, but she gave me some tips for taking better care of my scalp and the entire experience was great.

I will definitely be going back in the future.< /text>

The first time my son ever got a haircut the lady messed it up. When I found Big Mike it truly was a blessing since then my son has been getting his haircut here faithfully. The environment is very welcoming and if I left my son he would be well taken care of. Always recommending.<//Review>

<review>Stay away! Not very friendly, Female(I think) cant do a fade at all. She cut my ear and scratched the back of my head with the clipper. I asked her to fix it and all she did was go up higher but still wasn't straight. I would say you get what you pay for since the prices are low, but they aren't that low. I am never going there again.<//review>< Pictures>

Soups are OK.</Review>< Pics>

Love their 순대국밥!! ㅠ ㅁ ㅠ

Sometimes it's the best, sometimes you just scratch your head a little at the flavor. Usually, it straight gets the job done. If you're casual to Korean food, this is a good place to dive into the pool. If you're hardcore, this place is probably steadfast in your outdoors eating rotation.</Review>

Decent tasty Korean fare. The blood sausages had an unusual chewy starchy filler additive. The prices vs. quantity made for good value. Banchans were delicious, without leaving a sweet additive aftertaste. Service was fair, could improve.<//Text>

< Review>
The restaurant previous to this restaurant is called tofu cabin. I love the food at tofu cabin but this one seems to be lacking in something. The taste just not quite right and they're not going to use the Hot Pot anymore so that was a little frustrating. The serving is okay but for us it seems like all the tastes in the different dishes we ordered is Bland. I understand they have all the seasonings on the table but I think those seasonings are just two in the hands that already flavored the dishes..<//Review>

<Text>Our second time here at MBR and this time we ordered the gamjatang. After the first sip of the broth, we were immediately transported back in time about a month ago where we sat in a small establishment near Konkuk University in Seoul eating the same thing! 맛있어요! Dont forget to go around the corner to Hankook market to stock up on Korean essentials.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkddp7hnZH3GLf0SX3BIa6ymwQVDLy0HTa4bv5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

Honestly, tastes were a little bit different from what I expected but I still LOVE Spicy Blood Sausage Soup because its very hot spicy (I like spicy one a lot), tasty, addictive and works best for my hangover. lol :)   I also tried Pork Back Bone Casserole, that was very good for 2 people. Actually, its more than enough for qty for 2 people.   In addition, very clean and nice space and all staffs are very kind.  THANKS to ALL staffs.<//Text>

We ended up working late and wanted to try something new in the area, so decided to give this place a shot. Between three people, we got the 'small/medium' casserole soup. I wish it had a bit more flavor and spice to it. There were plenty of veggies and internal organ parts, but lacked in flavored. For the blood sausage, I thought I would enjoy that more since I love pork blood in soup, but for me it was bland and the texture a little off putting.

If you're curious, I say give this place a shot! The restaurant itself if very clean and spacious.< /Text>

<Text>Perhaps the only South Bay Korean pork "sausage" place that specializes in it. It's practically pork intestines stuffed with noodles or other stuffing. Definitely tasty. Their other dishes are also great and perhaps too authentic for non-Koreans to enjoy vernacularly. This is not a place you return but rather becomes a part of your life to fulfill the periodic pork sausage cravings.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>My new fave Korean restaurant in Santa Clara!

I really wanted to try the spicy blood sausage soup and it was amazing. It was *really* spicy, but very flavorful. Towards the end, the blood sausage started disintegrating so there were bits of vermicelli and blood sausage in the soup. I didn't mind, because it was just easier to eat, lol.

The banchan spread is also pretty good. Their kimchi is very flavorful. I also tried some of the soondoobu broth and it was flavorful.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Best Korean soup hands down, with some of the best kimchi I've had (and this comes from kinda a kimchi eating monster).

Please make sure you salt and season your food with the various jars of spices on your table. The broth by itself is less seasoned and asks to be made custom to your liking!< /text>

The best Soon-Dae-Gook in the town. There are mild and spicy flavors and both are popular. Because this restaurant has opened recently in the end of 2016, there are lots of guests. You should expect to wait about 10 mins on peak hours.

I strongly recommend as one of the best authentic Korean food!</text>

The staff are so friendly and nice. Their side dishes are really good and my husband said their kimchi is the best he’s ever had in his life (even considering the ones he had in Korea). Their food is quite authentic so it’s great for native Koreans like us but not sure for people who are not used to Korean food.
One more thing I really like about this place is, it’s really neat and clean. I don’t understand why but I often see the cleanliness of korean restaurants out of korea is not very good. This restaurant is, however, as clean as the normal restaurants I can see in Seoul.<//Text>

Don't bother coming to this place since they won't even seat you.
We came on Saturday around 1:30pm and half the tables were empty.
We stood at the entrance for about 15 minutes and the workers purposely avoided eye contact with us and refused to seat us.
We left after since it was clear that they did not want to serve us food.</Review>

<Review>Love the soondaegook here and how you can customize with the salt/ pepper/ sauces/ kimchi/ onion/ chives to create your own flavor. They give you plenty of meat. Usually I ask for no rice but extra chives & kimchi for my custom soup... very delicious! Haven't tried anything else though. They specialize in soondae.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) I will simply post
I posted a medium sized hotpot about $50 (including tex)
But it might be different, so it was really bad money. Soondae seems to be surrounded by artificial sundae shells on the right side. And since I bought a lot of MSG, I ate it all the time, but I still haven't eaten the taste like Miwon. Please don't do this. Please remind me to eat and come back again.
What is this? Please check the contents when submitting. For reference, I went to this house once before Corona, but at that time, it was really fine, so I submitted it for some reason.

간단하게 글 올려 봅니다
$50(텍스포함) 가량의 중간 사이즈 전골을 투고 했습니다
그런데 아니나 다를까 정말 돈이 아까울 정도로 형편 없었습니다.. 순대는 당면에 인조순대 껍질 둘러놓은것 같고 /곱창은 바닥까지 디져서 7~8개 /육수는 다시마 +멸치 국물낸 오뎅국물 같았고 ㅠ 나머지는 야채 그리고 MSG 뚬뿍 그래도 사왔으니 끊여서 먹었는데 역시나 미원같은 느끼한맛이 도저히 못먹고 버렸습니다 제발 이렇게 장사하지 마세요 먹고 다시 찾아올수 있게 또 지나가다 생각나게 만들어 주세요 아무리 투고래도
이게 뭡니까? 글 보시는 분들 투고할때 반드시 내용물 체크 하시기 바랍니다 참고로 이집에 코로나 전에 한번 다녀 갔는데 그때는 정말 괜챦아서 혹시나 해서 투고를 했는데 손님을 가지고 노내요 참 ~~주인분 신경을 쓰시기 바랍니다<//Review>

이집은 성의가 없눈것같아요 오늘은 식당이 거의 문을 닫은 시간에 가서 한번더 속아보자싶어 투고를 시켰는데 아니나 다를까 김치도 없고 느끼하게 어떻게 먹어라는 건지.... 작년에도 엉뚱한걸 만들어서 줘서 우리집까지 직원이 다시들고오는 기가먹힌 사연도 있구요 먹어보니 MSG  장난아님< /text>

<Text>I had ordered a Spicy Chicken bowl. They gave me a regular chicken bowl instead. Had to go back to exchange it, but when I got the new bowl, it had much less portions, almost half a bowl less. Not sure if they were spiffing me out of spite or if this place is just this bad. Also only included one fork for two bowls. Avoid this place.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd802532329b7:0x3af7989f86334cbb<//Gmap_id></record>

The food was ok. It is a nice mix of protein, carbs, and veggies. The sauce wasn’t that great in my opinion. The place is empty and doesn’t have much of a welcoming feeling. I would consider eating elsewhere.</review>

Friendly stuff! Went yesterday around 5pm and I was glad to see how I was welcomed in this location and how fast and precise my order was. Cashiers name was Diana and the kitchen lady did a great customer service. I saw how this store changed, so good job ladies. And great management service. 5 star restaurant......0,<//review>

<text>Seems to me after visiting several Flame broilers throughout the Southland, this one definitely cooked meats way ahead of people actually ordering. In other words, the chicken and meat was (unusually) dry and seemed as if it was reheated. Surely not fresh tasting at all.</text>< Pics>

<Text>I've been to flame broiler many times and the food is usually served fresh, delicious, and hot.

My favorite is the chicken bowl expect I don't like it when they drench it in teriyaki sauce while cooking it. Other than that it's delicious, healthy, and inexpensive.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I have been there about 4 times over the past 5 to 6 months.  Service is fine, but each time there is less and less rice and chicken in my bowl.  When I mentioned it today, all I got was a blank stare back from the cashier. I no longer feel this location offers a good value for the price.<//Review>

The parolee working the cash register, who also went to the back to fix my bowl with pre-made meat, filled my regular bowl about half way up with food. Won’t be going there again. I should have read other reviews before going.</text>

Came in for lunch the meat was burnt to a crisp. I mean it was black. I couldn't even taste chicken all I tasted was a charred flavor. I asked if I could get another plate and the girl ignored me and went to the back. When I called for someone else she came out again did not even look at me and took the plate but I told her I didn't want another plate I wanted a refund. She was so rude and went to the back and did not help me. Another employee eventually came to give me my refund. She threw the receipt at me and shoved the money in my hand. The portions aren't good for the price, the staff is ghetto, rude, and lacking in basic math skills. On top of all this the place is filthy. Go to Pollo Loco. Don't waste your time here, spend your money somewhere worthwhile where the staff are professional and the place is clean.</review>

So I'm visiting from arizona and I've been missing the food flame broiler has always had. Never been to the garden grove location before. I always went to the Fullerton location off commonwealth. The garden grove location was a huge disappointment . No sauce,dry meat. The service sucked . The girl actually had the nerve to finish her text before giving me my change . REALLY! For management if you want to look into it i was there at 12:32:59 on 12/22/2017.< /Review>

I came in with my mother & daughter. Girl working cashier today about 11am If I had to describe her in one word....unprofessional. I ordered two bowls with brown rice and one to go same order. Instead of brown she put white rice after I told her. Maybe if she stopped talking about leaving work early and calling off and would get off her phone she would have paid attention. I don't know who owns this flame broiler but I will never be back and I will let everyone know not to come here.< /Review>

Went in for lunch at this location. No one was at the the register. After a few mins one of the employees took my order. The girl was rude and doesn't belong on the register. These people have no customer service skills at all. They act like they are bothered, and not even a simple Hi or Thank You. Nothing at all, you don't need a high school diploma to learn the basic customer service skills. I don't expect much from these minimum wage workers, just the minimum amount of service would be fine. Say hello and than you, isn't that part of your training?< /Review>

<review>Staff are usually rude, indifferent, or dismissive. Wait time usually takes a while. They also close earlier than their stated hours which is not cool. I drive over thinking I will be making it in time only to pull on a locked door.</review><GmapID>0x80dcd802532329b7:0x3af7989f86334cbb< /GmapID><userid>111884629716146458758</userid>< Response>

Very rude lady. She doesn't know how to take online orders and made it very difficult. So when I asked to cancel the order she just hung up on me.</Review>

We're from out of town. We just left this nail place in the last 30mins. WORST nails, WORST service...all the way around unprofessional, borderlining on disrespectful. Was forced to pay before she was serviced; what business does that? The nails are complete TRASH!
This is what she asked for(top/left) & the other is what she got(bottom/right)...
I have to leave 1⭐.

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>First time coming here. Made a last minute appointment and I was accompanied for, which I liked. Told the receptionist what I wanted and she said I had to pay now. I’ve never been to a nail shop where you paid before being serviced. What if I didn’t like the style or what if I wanted to tip, because I don’t always carry cash? I went ahead and paid, Then I noticed I was the only one asked to pay first, and I was the only black person there as well. Other people got serviced then they were asked to pay. They did a decent job on my nails but I won’t be coming back.< /Text>< Pics>

My nails did ultimately come out okay, but holy cow what a process...they nickle and dimed everything, got angry when I asked for a cut, charged $20 extra for a nail polish I didn't ask for and then when I asked for the polish I originally picked out, they would only refund $10. They also make you purchase the tools they use. Dont recommend.<//review>

I came for a quick manicure during my lunch break. They switched my manicurist three times during my manicure. Then to top it off I paid the manicurist by Venmo and left. I walked one block then hear someone SCREAMING LOUD on Wilshire Blvd “you didn’t pay for your service” turn around and see the receptionist chasing me. I showed her the payment in my phone and all she replied was “oh”. Totally disgusting dirty people. At least she  should  have said sorry.<//review>

<text>Always quality work here. I really appreciate the details they go in to. Very clean facilities and a quick turnaround when there's a wait. This company knows what they're doing and I don't like going anywhere else. The drinks included are quite good and the options give a great variety to choose from. I recommend this place to all my friends.</text>< pics>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>Love this cute little nail salon gem in Los Angeles. I wanted to see Ken, because I've heard how amazing he is but I sadly missed my appointment with him, however the other ladies the salon are all great as well. Loved it there and will most definitely go there again.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2b91f581f6c17:0xb1edfd87f6f676c3< /GmapID>< pictures>

<Review>The best dip powder manicure I've ever had. Not sure who my nail tech was, I was visiting from out of town and had never been to this salon before. He took extra time and care shaping my nails. My nails looked AMAZING for 3 weeks. So pleased! Just sad this place isn't in my hometown!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I had to find a new nail salon since my regular spot had closed. This place is super cozy and everyone is super friendly, which helped me relax pretty quickly. Ella and Nicole are so sweet and funny. Nicole did amazing work and was very gentle. I am addicted to this place now and I am sooooo happy I found this spot.<//review>

Booked special pied Mani for partner and myself. Lily and Corinna slayed. I give myself top of the line Mani pedis, only buy the best Lippmann products at home. Almost never go elsewhere because no one does it right. This place is excellent.<//text>

This is the BEST salon I've been to of all time. And I grew up in nail salons.

There's nothing fancy about this place, but the service here is amazing. I've been here maybe 4/5 times now, and everyone has had that attention-to-detail that ensures perfection.< /Review>

Great artwork. Great attention to detail. Great, quality Japanese and Korean products used. Great customer service: response super quickly. Great finished product. I will post another review in a few weeks, that will testify Sarah's work! On top of that, she is the sweetest!< /Text>

<Text>I love this place! Rosie is my absolute favorite!! I'm super picky with acrylic nails and gel mani, well to say the least she's very neat, clean, and detail oriented. I've been to a few nail salons on Ventura blvd and I can honestly say they're the best! Rosie knows what's she's doing, their products are great. My gel nails last up to 3 weeks and doesn't chip unlike other places! The also have a very large selection of gel colors which I love!!! Can't wait to see you soon Rosie!!!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Im a regular the wynn nail salon Hollywood. I love the place so much, and they were fully booked today, so I've decided to give this branch a try, and it was a total disappointment. The place looks like its under construction, the sink in the bathroom didn't work, and the lady who removed my nail polish was rude and cut me with the file. I won't ever return to this branch.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

A little more expensive than the typical place, but the quality more than made up for it. They put a lot of effort into shaping my nails like I wanted and did 3 coats of polish, and the end product was great!</review>

WTF! When we went to Judy at Pride Nails. She was able to do any color, style we wanted. That's why she got an $100 tip.
If you just want plain simple manicure with the most unfriendly customer service. Then come to this spot. Otherwise goto Pride Nails just down the street.

Service is always exceptional here at Wynn Nail Spa. From Britini at the front desk to Holly, Ha and Amy, the service techs, customers always feel like they are well taken care of. They take their time so I never feel rushed and their attention to detail shows in the service quality. A bit pricier than other places but worth it.</text>

The receptionist is very rude I have been coming here for years and he doesn't respect customers. She wears glasses and has a European accent. I called to book appointment, she stated one hour I come in and she makes me tell her what number I called....I stated the one on Google (mind you this place is across from my condo) she forces me to get out my phone to show her what number I called! Having a terrible attitude. I'm a buisness manager and I really think people that work the front desk need to be trained better....however the nail artists are all great. No shade on them.</review>

<review>Great place for manicures and pedicures, their attention to detail is impressive. Make sure you call before going as its a trendy place and they may not be taking walk-ins due to overload. Definitely one of the favorite spots in LA.<//review>< date>

Very, very clean. Each pedi spa is lined with a disposable cover and all the stuff they use on your nails is ONLY used for you and thrown away after! Location is perfect, close to Kensington and right off the freeway.<//Review>

< review>
Worst experience I've had. I came in for 2 fixes that happened THE DAY AFTER I got them done. So when I get there she says she has to look at my nails to see what's wrong I said okay cool then she told me the new employee they hired forgot to charge me for chrome last time so they told me I had to pay $30 for the chrome I got and then $10 more to fix them! It's not my fault he didn't ring it up, I would've been happy to pay it next time but they were just rude the entire time and refused to fix my nails unless I paid them $40 first. Horrible customer service!< /review>

What a disappointment. On vacation in the los angled area myself and a friend decided to to get a pedicure and relax. Unfortunately we were over charged and still have the feeling on our feet and nails. They told me over the phone that a pedicure was 25 dollars. It was 5 dollars extra to bud your nails as well as scrub the bottoms of your feet. I have lived in many cities and have never been charged extra for the normal things a pedicure consists of.  So over priced to get your nails cut.<//review>

I've been coming to this nail spa for the last couple of years and I like it very much.  The people and atmosphere are nice.  I come here to get my wax done by Lana, she is the best.  She has taken care of my waxing since day 1 and I won't change her for anyone else, she really is great.< /Text>

My experience at Wynn was absolutely amazing! The wax product that was used was different from anything I have experienced and helped a lot in the pain level. I will continue to go there and don't need to try any other places. I did a Brazilian wax a couple of weeks ago and still have little hair growth, unlike other experiences where in a few days I have felt like I needed to go back. The wax that is used at this spa pulls the hair from the root instead of the surface so it actually works and is more healthy, I did not feel any pulling of my skin. It was a professional and comforting environment with even a reminder call for my appointment.< /text>

Worst nail Salon ever!! Most the girls that work here are Extremely rude and Jealous and they can refuse service if they want. I’ve been refused service so many times coming here when already having an Appointment set prior!! My nails take time since I usually do either powder ombré or gel with chrome or rockstar gel and spend always over $100 every time one time on my bday spent $200 they refuse me every time one girl said because my nails take too long when I been coming here for a while now All the girls here refuse me except maybe One and one evil girl always talks about me when I walk in when I come to this place. So many times I had an appointment came then they refused me and I had nowhere to go since most places need appointments ahead of time and u have to call prior and then they’re full so left with nowhere to do. The owner here Needs to change the policy that they can refuse service if they want. Terrible Terrible service I am Extremely disappointed!! Also if u notice something wrong with your nail they don’t like to fix it and have an attitude will Not be coming back here and would like to talk to the owner. I’ve spent Wayyy too much money in this salon to be treated with that type of treatment.</review>

<Review>Over all good service but too expensive on many things. They charge Double on callus treatment and almost double on a pedi and they do the same as most places. I’ll just keep my lady just 2 miles down the road and she is awesome. Go to complete nail 3959 wilshire.  This place  is a waste of money</Review>< Pictures>

Wait want long at all for a walk in, probably 15 minutes. Got a pedicure, it was very well done, thorough and detailed. I'm not a big talker and want forced into small talk that makes me uncomfortable so that is a huge plus for me.</review>

< Review>
The owner is unprofessional and has the worst customer service. She doesn’t take criticism and customer complaints very well; instead of handling them seriously, she takes them personally. I tried to make an appointment and because I kept asking questions about a tech’s availability, she tried rushing me off the phone because I wasn’t completely ready when she wanted me to be. When I spoke up about how rude she was being, she hung up in my face. I didn’t know it was the owner until I called back to find out who this employee was who hung up on me. So, not ok to treat customers that way and a horrible example for your employees.< /Review>

< Review>
love my nails!
I got a medi And Gel pedi and fell in love with their blue massage chairs and their amazing hot lotion.

Who knew hot lotion can make your body tingle with happiness. I absolutely fell in love with the lady that did my gel nails but unfortunately, i don't recall her name!
Hopefully a picture will suffice!
Parking may be a bit difficult but if you get lucky, meter is the way to go.<//Review>

< Review>
Over priced and horrible work.  Needed to remove my gel extensions and they were literarily ripped off my fingers; leaving them raw and in a lot of pain. I have layers of nail missing at the top and they are really sensitive.  The aluminum foil used to remove the polish from the gel manicure was from a previous guest.  I mean how cheap can you be to reuse aluminum foil from a previous customer.  When I was going to soak my feet I asked if they were not going to put in the blue barbaside disinfectant; the response "we just cleaned it"...  I have had nail extensions for years and have never had them removed this way!  This place is a ripoff and not worth the time or, money.<//Review>

Found through Yelp, thank you! There's so many nail shops on Beverly and surrounding area but happy to come to Leann. Mani/spa pedi for $25. Bikini wax for $25.  They take their time, the shop is clean, the service is great, and you get $10 off on your 10th visit.  There are meters in front, but best of all, free parking until 6pm on side streets.  I'll take it!< /Text>

Had an appt for bachelorette party of 4 waited 30 min.. Got the metallic polish on my nails and the Manicurist left the dark powder all around my nails..telling me " It's ok it will wash of later when you keep washing your hands" WTHECK?! NO.. We had activities following the appt and a client should leave the chair with perfect nails for THAT price. Today is day 2 and now the are clowdy and chipping! Rip off with this Manicurist. My friends got beautiful jobs and that was worth all the negative< /Text>

This place was ok. I felt rushed. It was a little expensive. The place was a little rundown too.

I got a Mani/pedi with $5 extra nail polish that's suppose to last longer, so my total came to $46.

But the most annoying thing is that you can't tip at the cashier, so they have an ATM machine in there where I have to pull out cash, which cost an extra service fee of $2.50, just to tip the nail ladies.

They didn't do a bad job, but I won't be returning.< /text>

< Review>
When picking up the pizza I ask the attendant who charge and gave me the pizza, to cook it more, he said he can't, he is a white male about 27 years old, slim about 180 lbs, 6' tall.

I also could see the person making the pizzas, was very dirty, he is a big person, probably 325 libs. 5'10" tall.

Never going back.< /Review>

Did not get what I ordered. Of my 5 selected toppings, I got 3 and my other 2 were replaced by red bell pepper (which I hate). I threw the leftovers in the trash<//Review>

I ordered once for delivery,  no complaints here. The $5.99 per medium pizza is a sweet deal, I bought 3 of them and didn't even feel bad about it, which i usually do when I order 3 pizzas from anywhere but Little Caesars xD</review>

<review>I really hope they do record the phone calls and then listen to them and give the people feedback because somebody needs to tell the lady I was just talking to to have a more pleasant tone with customers. Everything she said in a tone like she really didn’t want to be talking to me. Lady I don’t wanna talk to you either but your website is even worse to order pizza from. Well maybe not worse than her.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Date>1574556088073<//Date></record>

Poorly managed store.

Way better pizza than it was when I was growing up. I do have one complaint however...everytime I order for delivery they are late getting it to me & I literally live less than 1 mile away from the Robles Dr location.< /Review>

Although the pizza was missing onions, the staff were kind and were quick to mend the issue. Overall the pizza was still good and the staff is very kind. The pizza was ready within the time limit that they gave us for pickup.<//text>

The pizza tastes good and it's affordable. The staff are friendly and do the best they can. I'm not expecting fine dining I'm expecting cheap pizza and that's what I get and that makes me happy. The staff are students and young people doing their best<//Review>

Best Dominoes around. Perfect every time I have ordered. I usually do take out... which assures that my pizza is hot when I get it home. Plus i save on carry out. ;)< /text>

My favorite driver is Sonny! She remembered me and she is as her name- sunny! We've been very pleased as of late with everything we've ordered and with the super nice drivers. The workers in-store are always cheerful and greet you as you walk in. This location has been doing what it takes to keep spending our money there.</text>

We ordered the online pizza deal for a large 3 topping pizza. Went to go pick it up, the Domino's didn't have napkins, red pepper flakes or even CHEESE and the worst part of it all is the actual pizza barely had ANY cheese at all. Honestly, the worst pizza I have eaten. I would not want to waste my money and time at this place again.< /Review>

<Review>Ordered 3 pizzas on the app for the guys at work to be ready for pickup at 12. I show up at 12:10 and no pizza ready. I was told there system went down and they will start making my order now. I could not wait the 15 min for them to make and cook 3 pizzas . Why set a time to be ready if you can't provide it at that time?</Review>< user_id>

Placed an online order, i ordered 2 pizzas, a bacon jalapeno cheesy bread and cinnamon twists with dipping sauce, also 6 side cups of ranch. Picked up order, 1 pizza was missing the jalapenos, the bacon jalapeno cheesy bread turned out to be just cheesy bread, no dipping sauce in my cinnamon twist box and no sided of ranch. Over $7 of extras i ordered were not included. There was no one else in the store and only 1 order on the screen, not like they were busy!<//review>

<text>This is possibly the worst Domino’s store on the planet. Last week I waited for an hour and a half for a pizza. Called the store to find out my order had been canceled because no driver showed up.
Fine. This week I ordered a pizza, store actually called today (yay!) but it was to ask if I wanted to cancel or wait for 2 hours for my delivery since they only had one driver. Horrible. Done trying to order mediocre pizza from this pit.</text>< Pictures>

Checked back in today to see if Dominoes had gotten themselves back together...

Still a $4 delivery fee PLUS taxes PLUS tip.

So if you are a decent tipper and buying for 1 or 2 people, you are paying almost 100% more for taxes, fees and tips.

Canceled order at checkout, ordering from one of the other local pizza places where I can pay slightly more base cost, end up paying less for the final bill and get a better pizza. And I don’t have to spin the roulette wheel for either a 30 minute delivery time or a 3 hour delivery time.

Too bad the local places don’t have any dessert items... oh well, I don’t ‘need’ the extra calories anyway.</text>

Whenever we order the pasta in a bread bowl they always fail to season the bread bowl crust . They are supposed to be seasoned with butter and garlic. I have reported this to the corporate offices and they say they will address the issue with the local owner, that the bread bowl is supposed to be seasoned. This location still fails to make the bread bowl properly.</Review>

<text>69% in taxes and fees per order? Dominoes is getting out of control with delivery fees. Just incorporate it into the prices of the pizzas, you aren't fooling anyone with "Cheap pizza" and huge delivery fees. It's been a year or so since I ordered Dominos, looks like it is going to be another year or so. Food quality? Baseline pizza, not great, not terrible. Delivered hot, usually. Abnormal frequency of 1+hour delivery times.<//text>< pictures>

The Pizza take ages to get here. It's good food but the delivery takes a long time. I wish I could track my driver to see if he is delivering other pizzas or is he sitting around doing nothing because every time i order it can take from 1-2 hours after it leaves the store< /Review>

DON’T ORDER FROM HERE!!
I get it, you’re hungry and you want to stay at home cause it’s raining or what ever may be the case. These guys are terrible! 4 mins away from my house and it took up to 3 hrs! What a joke.. also going to mention how half of my order was not even delivered to me!
Had to call the store four times to understand what was going on.
Not worth it, try pizza hut.<//Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>Used online app.  said order was ready for pick up so I left the house to pick it up  ended up having to wait another 30 in store for order to be completed.   pizza was soggy and hardly no cheese or toppings.   It was so bad most of  the pizza was just pizza sauce and crust.  we ate one slice (if that) and the rest went in the garbage(wasn't going to waste time and gas to drive it back to them).    How is this place still in business?   Always get good food and service at Domino's in the past,  first time trying this location and will be the last.   Would give minus 10 stars if it were possible they are that horrible.<//text>< Rate>

<Review>Placed an order at 5:30pm got an email that stated a 12-22 min delivery time??? Odd?? And that it was being prepared by Estafany!  Then an uneducated unprofessional Supervisor calls me at 6:06pm to say that my order would take another hour and 45mins for delivery because they were short staffed and no drivers, how is that my problem???  I tracked my order and it was finished and I have a screenshot of it stating that at 6:35pm So, we get our food/order at nearly 7:30pm totally disgusting and unethical, it was cold, the pasta wasn’t even what we ordered it looked like it came out of the trash, and the lava cakes rock hard, time is money and money is time! Do not waste your time or money on this place!

I demand a refund!!! Infull!!! ASAP!!! You should be ashamed if yourselves! Conducting this type of business or food practices! If we get sick We will hold you liable and contact The Health Department!</Review>< Resp>

<text>I’ve ordered delivery from this location 10+ times and I have never once had it delivered remotely on time. Tonight, for example, I placed my online order at 8:30 and it’s now 10:50. The tracker says my order has been ready since 9:15, but somehow still hasn’t left the location. It’s possible that tracker technology has added more anxiety to my life than my taxes.

Get the order wrong about 25% of the time. Pizza is late about 25% of the time (Internet order). Payment in-store takes a long time for lack of normal credit card equipment. Employees not responsive to customers. Why do I put up with this? The store is a half-mile from my house and the next closest pizza place is about 3 miles away. The pizza is OK.</Text>

Over-charged for pizza.

Refused to enroll me in "piece of the pie" rewards, and failed to give me credit for purchase.  Domino's claims that my email address is taken.  I have had the address with Google for 12 years and prior to that with Netscape and Sprint.  I a Domino's email/coupon sent to me at my email to connect to Domino's with the coupon used for the order to make the purchase, and Domino's with all their wisdom then claimed it was not mine.  The lights are on...

I have been registered with Domino's with the same email for years at different locations, as I have rented houses in different cities in the Bay Area during the past several years.  Does Dominos believe we are not entitled to relocate or that someone is going to hijack my email to order a medium pizza with a coupon sent to my email address?</review>

<Review>Absolutely the worst pizza ordering experience of my life! I ordered my pizza tonight on 25 February 2017 at 728 pm and still after 1 1/2 I have nothing. I called the manager and explained the deal and let him know the website said 20mins and his response was "ya it's wrong" "average wait time right now is 2hrs".....what a joke.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80857249cee9bf03:0x3ddf138969151f2d< /gmap_id></record>

<text>Ordered a large pizza at 9:00pm and now it's 11pm I called four times. The man on the line sounded like he was high and lied saying that they have came and knocked on the door, which had never happened. I'm a regular customer and service is usually fast but tonight considering it is the day after 4/20 the workers are a little slow.< /text>< Rate>

Waited 2 hours for my pizza. Online tracker said it was delivered.
I called the location and they stated they would give me a refund without ever taking my info. I guess they have psychics working the phone there?
Pizza finally arrives and the driver has his girlfriend in his car and my food is cold.
Guess he had to stop and "relieve some stress" before finishing my delivery.< /text>

<username>Chris Lum< /username><review>So disappointed with @dominos GlenCove. Don't lie to people especially when they are really hungry. I understand when you told me to wait 5-7 minutes more after 30 minutes when I ordered using the App and when it says my orders were ready. But what is not acceptable is after more than 10 minutes of waiting inside this branch, you gonna tell me that they are just gonna start cooking chicken wings and you blame others for it. NO, don't blame anyone, it was your fault! Do your job! I wasted almost an hour from the start I ordered using App. I go to your place every week and order the same thing. Now because of what happened, I won't ever go to this place. Oh, never again with ALL Dominos. I was so disappointed! SMH!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

This was the worst pizza I've ever had from Domino's. The pizza was way over cooked, it didn't have barely any sauce or cheese on it, it wasn't even cut! It wasn't worth the almost $24 it cost.< /Text>

The delivery was a little late. The tracker told me it was delivered and I couldn't contact the store so I thought I was just out of luck, But eventually my order arrived.</review>

I'm at the Valero refinery in Benicia working nights, I ordered online and 40 minutes later they called and said they weren't delivering tonight. The lunch truck was already gone from the refinery. Kinda screwed me tonight.<//Text>

They are the worst! Ordered online and was following the tracker for over a hour and nothing. I finally called the store only to have the first person hang up on me and for them to tell me that they only have one driver and the delivery time is 3 hours!! 3 hours!<//Text>

They have the worst service. The manager is rude.  This is the second order I’ve placed and both times my order was way later than my confirmation stated. When calling the store all they ever say is we’re busy.<//review>

<name>Jenni Amburn</name><text>Cookies are amazing and keep me coming back every week. I would recommend ordering for pick up or curb side pick up because since this is a new location there is sometimes a long line. Which I mean is totally understandable for these amazing cookies. The store is really really loud inside, I feel like they can do without the music.
This store in my opinion clearly does not care about Covid Guidelines. No one is 6 feet apart, not all guest are wearing masks, and some employees are not wearing their masks at all or correctly.
But I will still come back each week to try out the new flavors they make. 👍🏻<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

However I was a little worried that the worker would not find us because there is no designated curbside parking, in addition to the parking lot being super packed. Very pleased with the service and cookies. I didn’t really care for the confetti cookie but the rocky road cookie was amazing 10/10 would recommend this cookie and place to everyone!< /Review>< pictures>

We ordered the Party Pack 12 for a birthday using the app. The order was done extremely fast, within 20 mins. Boxed beautifully with a personal message. Curbside service was fast and easy. They let you know if anyone is waiting ahead of you, but it moves to you quickly. We ordered a variety of cookies, so far our favorites are the Oreo (hubby) and Animal Cracker Sugar Cookie (it doesn’t even need the frosting, it’s so good). We’re saving the Blueberry to have with coffee in the morning. The chilled sugar and chocolate chip were also yummy. Congrats on a Great First Day (Lodi).<//Review>< GmapID>

A dear friend brought me my first Crumbl cookies this week. Oh my goodness, very yummy!! The regular chocolate chip was tasty with a great balance of cookie to chocolate chip. And the sugar cookie...oh my! Loved it so much. Kept it in the fridges district ate off of it for 3 days!! Time for more! Welcome to Lodi, Crumbl!!</text>

Don't go yet if you want their normal service. Cookie was fine, but when I ordered the waffle cookie, they forgot to include the syrup. I had to ask before they gave me back the syrup.  That's how crazy they were inside for grand opening.
Cookie itself tasted fine but with the additional toppings, not even adding the syrup yet, the icing is way too sweet. Not thinking of going back.<//Text>

<userid>102420887597796734114<//userid><Review>Store grand opening here in Lodi, CA and so far not impressed. I thought the circus cookie looked different than the picture. That's because the gave me chilled sugar instead. For what they charge, they should get the order right. Will post another review after I taste them.
After my family sampled all the cookies I bought, we all thought they were not as good as we had heard. In fact, I make better tasting chocolate chip cookies.
Maybe it was because today was their grand opening, I don't know, but if this is what they normally taste like, I'm not a fan.< /Review>< Time>

I waited and waited and nothing. I then had to park directly in front of the store in a non-parking space to get their attention. 2 workers said they would check and nothing. Then ignored me. A gentleman getting more boxes said he would check. Another 10 minutes he finally brought me a box. It wasn’t even my order but I took it anyways!  2:52 I was done with this cookie place. Very unorganized if they mess up.

I ordered a 12 pack and ended up with a few cookies I didn’t order instead of what I had actually ordered but since they are new I let it go.

First time buyer here. I ordered 2 cookies Strawberry Shortcake & Brownie PB. I got to my car and saw that instead of strawberry shortcake I was given chocolate chip. I called and they told me to come back in so I did and when the cashier told the girl that was boxing up the cookies I got a very rude look and a cold Strawberry Shortcake cookie. The cookies are very good so of course I will come back.I understand mistakes happen.<//Text>

Are you kidding me? Your business is completely unorganized.

I’ve had their cookies before but never visited a store personally. The place was busy but it ran like a well oiled machine. Ordering process was quick and simple and I didn’t have to wait long for my cookies. I would definitely return!</text>

I ordered through online, and I am not satisfied because the dasher had an issue, my order got canceled, tried contacting them they never answered after few business days i never got my money back. Completely got scammed by this company and I will never buy from Crumbl again because of my first experience with ordering. Be careful people.</Text>

OMG ! They’re So Huge ! I’ve Been Known Since I Was 3 As The Cookie Monster, and I Think These Cookies 🍪 🍪 Will Be The Ones To Take Me Out. Soo Delicious & Love How The Menu Always Changes. Makes Your Come Back Over And Over To Try All The Different Varieties.</text>
