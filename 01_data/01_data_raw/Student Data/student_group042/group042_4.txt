<text>This store needs better management, I see new hires struggling trying to do the best they can. Production is slow because they are lost w/ no guidance. They could have a line out the door and only two people on the line and like two people in the back doing other things. I feel like they need to prioritize task specially during peak times.< /text><Rating>2<//Rating>< Time>

Chipotle is always great but the staff at this location are top notch. Every time I've been here, everyone is positive and energetic and having a good time while working. Employees regularly help each other out and it's clear that they are operating as a well-trained team. Kudos to the great management and employees that make this happen.<//text>

Went there during lunch spent 30 minutes in line from the door step to cashier. They Couldn’t the food orders right and they had mixed grub hub orders with standing customers. A man ask for side of guacamole three times and they still delay all orders. They are just not coordinated. Got my order wrong! The Burritos get rolled into a ball rather then rolled burrito.< /review>

I am a manager at a Chipotle in Arizona and me and my boyfriend were craving some good ol’ chipotle bowls during our stay in Del Mar and I was truly impressed with their service. Super cheery, asked us both how we are, beyond polite, the line people and cashier had fantastic customer service, and I just wanted to share what a good experience we had. Food was fantastic as well; we could definitely tell the standards were more than met. Everything was super clean as well despite being located in a pretty densely populated area. Great job Del Mar crew!</Text>

Whether it's due to the rapid expansion, inexperienced unit and district management, or trying to cut costs, this concept is being overtaken by others. Local options in particular are capturing more marketshare because their offerings are fresher, more flavorful and quite often served by friendlier staff.
Our visit was acceptable, but nothing special. The bowls we ordered were relatively bland, but quickly prepared.
The facility was clean, the staff seemed bored and yet rushed. No thank yous, no personality.
It's disappointing because, prior to the well documented food handling problems at many locations, this concept was poised to dominate.<//Review><GmapID>0x80dc08deac92eaab:0xf0ba911d84925206<//GmapID></record>

I got extremely sick from this location for multiple days. I reached out to the store manager with no follow up from them or from headquarters. A few days later after I started feeling better, I went back to the establishment and met the General Manager  Jorge A Escorcia who was extremely hostile and rude to me from the get go. He emphasized that he knew who I was because of the phone call I made to the manager earlier in the week. He insisted that their restaurant could not have made me sick and continued to be-little me until he flat out told me I was making a false acquisition about their restaurant. I had not eaten that day and after eating there I was ill after some hours, and he said that it was not possible that I could get sick from their food that quickly. I had to basically force him to write a report about the incident and requested that a follow up was made to ensure that had gone through the necessary procedures to double check their food safety standards to make sure no one else would get sick. He continued to use sarcasm and extremely short responses to anything I asked or said. From here I was at the point of just giving up with hopes to hear back from the headquarters in which he stated that they would be reaching out to me. 1 1/2 weeks later and I have still not received any follow up. This is a terrible example of customer service and does nothing but shine light on the poor standards of food safety and hygiene.  Once again, to anyone that reads this, do not go into this Chipotle as you are in grave danger of getting sick from their food. I have worked in customer service for well over 15 years and have never treated anyone with such disrespect as I was given from Jorge Escorcia. Shame on him and his work place standards. He is a pathetic excuse of a General Manager and should be demoted for his poor actions.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

It's very rare that I can go there and not circle around and around looking for parking. The shopping center does have additional parking, however it is on the opposite end.

The line manager was fabulous! It was late, we were hungry. She explained exactly how it all worked, rice, beans added condiments. Mine was vegan, she understood immediately.  We were all served in less than 10 min. I have never been more grateful for good, FAST, healthy food in my life.<//text>

Chipotle is my favorite fast food place and I go to many of them in multiple states. With that being said, the portions given by the employees here are really small, even if I asked for extra due to the stinginess. My bowl feels a third smaller than it usually is. 🤷‍♀️<//Text>

They got my order wrong from the start.  When I got the food back to my employees, the chicken burrito I ordered didn't have any chicken in it.  I drove back to the restaurant and let them know.  The employee asked it she could just put it in a sides cup instead of remaking the order.  I asked for it to be remade and she told me that rather than sound redundant by confirming the order, they just assume that it's a veggie burrito.  They would rather be redundant than wrong.  I didn't want to keep the wrong order, I didn't ask for anything for free, just wanted it to be made correctly.  Unfortunately she made it seem like it was my fault that they forgot an ingredient.  Terrible customer service.  There was one employee there that was more than helpful, I regret not getting her name.<//Review>

<review>Good food at a reasonable price.

Selection allowed for everyone in my group to be accommodated.

Though it was very loud the staff didn't have any trouble communicating and things were swiftly prepared and presented well.

Had enough that at least one member of the group was taking leftovers so it worked out quite nicely.< /review>< Rate>

< Review>
Even though the line was very short I was rushed and the person making order seemed perturbed by what I wanted. Her tone was just negative . I was getting two salads and they didn’t have enough lettuce and had to wait for more, kinda acted like it was my fault that they didn’t have enough lettuce . Then the tone was just off when I wanted rice , beans, etc. just too much negativity .< /Review>

I came in for chicken bowl and they were out of veggies. Was going to be a five minute wait, but I didn't want to wait. When I got to the register they come see my mail because they weren't able to give me the veggies and I would have had to wait. Great customer service and I appreciate it. Thanks< /text>

So the parking lot is crowded but there was no line in the restaurant. I asked for fajita veggies on my bowl and the employee gave them to me and then said "oh you know its a dollar extra for those". I said no I wouldn't have gotten them if I'd have know that. They didn't charge me the extra dollar but it was just kind of a weird comment. Then there was no forks and it took them a few minutes to get me one.
Other than that it was a good experience, the quality of the food is always good and fresh at Chipotle, portion size at this location is good. I love that its non-GMO!
Beer at this location but no Margaritas</text>

<Review>I go to a lot of Chipotles cross the the USA and this is by far the worst one. most of the other Chipotles give you a full scoop of rice and a good portion of meat this one gives you half of spoon of rice and one small pinch meat (like less then half of what other ones give) and there no forks or lids took them 5 mins to get them and they were not busy 8 people on the inside and like 5 out side and no line will not be coming back to this ever and I come to del mar a few times a year< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The best vintage shop in the city. Friendly people who will help you find whatever you are looking for, and there is something beautiful in all price ranges. Everything in the store is a quality curated piece ready to wear, no dusty mucky stuff to sift through to find something nice.<//Review>

<Text>The lady in the store was kind and helpful, the clothes were beautiful and there were so many different things, the store was clean, and it was generally great. I bought a pretty yellow dress from the 1950's for $150 but it was in almost perfect condition and worth the money. I also saw things going back to the 1920's, so I can say they're not lying about having old things.</Text><name>xxstrawberrysaamxx< /name><userid>102352976136805943373< /userid><gmap_id>0x808587530530a0b1:0x9dcbe9f30e5de167<//gmap_id><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

What a fabulous experience shopping at Relic. The way they categorize their items makes it easy to shop, the quality is great, the store is well merchandised and the staff is so knowledgeable and friendly. I walked out with the perfect 1950’s glam outfit I was looking for!  Thank you, Relic. I felt perfectly fashioned for my party. I will recommend your to others (and already have)!<//Text>

I was blown away by the wonderful selection of not only women's, but also men's, vintage attire. Both Terra and Oran were wonderful! They helped me find some beauties that I would have never thought would fit (and did!) and were overall wonderful. I learned some new vintage clothing facts (I always love learning more about what I am wearing) and found some wonderful items to purchase. I have never been treated as such a priority while in the shop. I wish I lived closer so I could shop there more often. If I'm back in the area, I will definitely be stopping in again!< /text>< pics>

Love it! I've only ever been here twice while browsing on Haight. I really admire the quality selection available. Good, well made vintage clothes. It kind of has that musky "vintage" smell but I wouldn't mind that. It adds to the atmosphere of this cute little shop. The second time I visited I found this beautiful dress. I didn't really have an occasion to wear it for but I simply couldn't leave without it. I tried it on and it fitted like a glove. The man was super helpful in zipping it up and good advice. He told me the story behind it and all without being too pushy. It's great to find lovely, one-off beautiful pieces like this!< /Text>

<text>I went to Relic vintage today and was amazed by the selection of vintage clothing they had. I purchased 3 items and am in love with all of them. I've never been to such a beautiful vintage shop that wasn't extremely expensive or super old lady. Their items are affordable and completely unique. Everything is one of a kind. I went in with a couple of friends and  the workers there started us a fitting room and even brought extra clothes to us that he thought we'd like. We loved all of it. By far my new favorite vintage shop and will 100% be returning.<//text>< pics>

Relic Vintage is quite literally the store of my dreams; I never knew something so perfect could actually exist until I walked in and saw it all for myself. To start I'd like to say the clothing selection is amazing. Every piece there is desirable and beautiful and made at a high standard that is quite frankly missing in clothing nowadays. I got chills from touching some of the gorgeous pieces. I could definitely spend hours in this store simply marveling at everything. For women there is a generous selection of pieces ranging from beautiful party dresses to irresistible pedal pusher capris. As I was browsing, my mouth agape, I was immediately approached by Oran and he started a dressing room for me. Oran gave me the best service, by far, that I've ever had at a store. I'd find a pair of pants and he'd know just the thing that would go with him. He brought me countless beautiful party dresses to try on and very single one of them fit me perfectly and were something that I loved and would pick out myself. And same for the friend I was with. He appears to have a talent for figuring out people's size and taste in dress without even asking. I wish everyone who worked in stores were like Oran. I will definitely be returning very soon. If you have a chance to go to Relic Vintage, do not pass it up! Everything about this store is unbelievably amazing.</Text>

<Text>I popped in twice today to try on a vintage denim jacket and the gentleman behind the counter was so lovely and friendly.

Wonderful, well curated store. The prices are, in my opinion, reasonable and comparable to mid-range, modern ready to wear (~65 for a day dress, ~125 for a cocktail dress, ~175 for an evening gown). When vintage shopping, I tend to spend a lot of time checking how the garment was constructed and confirming that I won't have to invest hours repairing and reinforcing a piece just to make it wearable. Relic's pieces were all in impeccable shape. I will be back.<//Text>

This truly is one of the best vintage stores that exists. It has an incredible selection of beautiful clothes without being overwhelming. Oran who runs the store manages to get the best pieces in and is incredibly accommodating. He let me try dresses on for hours without making feel bad for not buying lots (though I will when I'm home at Christmas). I always have to stop by when I'm in the city and I adore my pieces I've bought from him. Do yourself a favour and visit this gem of a store!!< /Review>

Oran greeting both me and a friend and showed us dressing rooms. He gave us a wide selection of beautiful outfits that he knew exactly would go together to try on. You can spend hours in awe trying on fashion of the early and late 20th century for very reasonable prices. I am for sure coming back soon!</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I went shopping here for my wedding dress today and was soo impressed by Oran and his customer service. He spent over an hour helping me try on gowns, custom styling me, etc. made me feel very comfortable. i can tell you it was WAY better than any experience I have had in any bridal shops!!! and so much more fun. i am from southern ca and the selection here for vintage bridal was way better than anything i have seen at other stores and very fairly priced! HIGHLY recommend and ask for Oran!! he is the best!< /Review>

I was on vacation in San Francisco and was recommended by a friend to visit Relic vintage and decades of fashion. I mainly wear vintage clothing and was excited to find a treasure. After being treated very poorly by staff and owner at decades I was pleasently suprised at the amazing customer service in Relic. The owner and staff were fun, kind, funny and so helpful. I left with one of the most beautiful vintage dresses I have ever purchased. Thank you so much for your incredible clothing and wonderful experience!<//text>

Relic Vintage is unlike any other vintage store that I have ever been to and I am a diehard vintage-enthusiast. The selection is impeccable, curated by the fabulous owner, Oran, who has an eye for top quality vintage and prices his pieces affordably. I think the best part about shopping here is knowing that Oran will take the time to fit you into a perfect look and provide a unique shopping experience. I wish he could be my personal stylist! So many times, I have gone into vintage stores only to feel like I was rummaging at a yard sale and that is NOT the case here. Everything is in really good shape because Oran is a tailor, as well, and can fix any piece! Amazing! In fact, there was one dress I had my eye on but was far too tight, and he was able to transform it to fit me perfectly. I cannot recommend Relic Vintage enough! I tell all of my friends and family to shop here and bring my girls in for a fun time trying on clothes. In fact, Oran fitted out my bridesmaids for my wedding and they all looked AMAZING.<//text>

A real vintage clothing store owned and operated by an SF legend and generally outstanding individual: Oran AKA (OkieOran) Scott

As a greaser,and an oldies dj I have had this exchange a few times over the years. Patron: "Nice costume!" Me: "Thanks, but I'm not in 'costume'. these are my clothes. " Relic Vintage is where you go if you want quality vintage merchandise, that's been hand picked by someone with real style, who lives the life, go see Oran and his crew at vintage.
Tell 'em Heartbreak sent you.

<Text>Everyone is really nice and friendly, but the communication was very confusing and a bit frustrating. Not the best communication about what was being done and how much it was going to cost me. I felt like the doctor was trying to rush while explaining it to me. Didn’t explain everything either as his assistant did a better job at doing that.

Other than that the place is good, and the hygienist was awesome!! She explained everything to me step by step.

Wish the doctor did the same. I wanted his professional opinion on what I could do right away and what I had to wait for financially and I felt like he didn’t take that into consideration which was disappointing.< /Text><Name>Veronica Martinez< /Name><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I had a good relationship with this business and they fully understood that I would be paying the bill for my adult son.

However, they performed elective procedures that cost me almost $800 and unfortunately this business performed work without my verbal confirmation.

This is very disappointing.<//review>

Great experience at iTooth Dentistry.
Very friendly staffs and dentist.  I definitely felt like I was talking to my friends. Dr. Mendoza was superb! He made a somewhat scary procedure feel so smooth and easy and he patiently answered all my questions.  Will definitely schedule another appointment for me and my family.< /Review>

They are always ready for their patients and they are super friendly! Some things at the dentist can be awkward or uncomfortable and they make everything very comfortable and easy! I had two wisdom teeth out recently in office and there was little to no pain and it all healed perfectly!</review>

Hands down one of the best dentist experiences I’ve ever encountered. Dr. Mendoza and his entire staff were absolutely amazing. Jordan was incredibly welcoming and helpful with my initial paperwork. Then Jenn the hygienist was just above and beyond great. She was super thorough and I loved how well she explained everything to me before even starting. She made me feel super comfortable and left my teeth spotless. The entire office was spotless. Everything was super clean and you could tell everyone’s top priority is the patient, their comfort and safety. That’s truly important to me, that any medical facility I visit be clean and sterile, and iTooth went beyond all expectations. Dr. Mendoza ended up having to extract one of my molars due to too much decay but he went through all of my options with me first, answered every single one of my questions and did what was best for me. He was extremely patient and made sure I felt as little pain and discomfort as possible. He would explain what he was doing at every step and it made me feel very confident in his knowledge and abilities which in turn made me relax and the entire process was honestly a breeze. I will be coming back for my cleanings and all other dental needs without a doubt!<//Review>

I recently changed dental insurance, so I had to find a new dentist because my previous dentist wouldn’t take my new insurance. I’m so happy I found iTooth Dentistry, Dr. Mendoza is very professional. With my previous dentist I was going to pay over 1,000 dollars for two crowns. I paid much less with Dr. Mendoza. I will continue coming to iTooth Dentistry. They do a great job<//review>

<Review>Hands down one of the best dentist and staff in the valley.  Very accommodating with a few of my emergencies, including opening up his office on a weekend to see me when I had a dental emergency.  The staff is equally as attentive and accommodating as Dr. Mendoza.  I highly recommend and would have given more stars if it were possible.< /Review><gmapID>0x80945cd9dd36f21d:0x3290c0c3523c8dd8</gmapID>< Pics>

<Review>Dr. Mendoza and his staff are very friendly and so helpful.. Today was my very first visit and I am pleased with their work..  He explains everything he is doing to make sure you are feeling comfortable.. He did a great job, I did not feel any pain when he pulled out my tooth... He is very knowledgeable and explained everything thoroughly. I would highly recommend Dr. Mendoza to anyone looking for a dentist.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>I highly recommend Dr. Mendoza and his staff at iTooth Dentistry. Upon walking into the dental office, you feel as if you're waking into a spa. It's a nice and relaxing feeling. The staff at the front desk are welcoming and quick to answer any questions you have. There is virtually no wait and tenure always punctual.

Once seated in the massage chair (so awesome), you'll notice the new technology and equipment in the examine room. Dr. Mendoza is very thorough in explaining your plan of care and answering any questions you might have. You don't feel rushed. He takes his time with his patient. The dental hygienist was also very gentle and thorough. My dental cleaning was painless!

I recommend going to iTooth Dentistry. I loved it so much that I've been telling my friends and family to switch to Dr. Mendoza for their dental needs.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80945cd9dd36f21d:0x3290c0c3523c8dd8</gmapID></record>

Walking into Dr. Mendoza’s office was like walking into a modern-day spa! The atmosphere was very calming, not to mention clean! One thing I loved and found unique, besides the massage chairs...yes, massage chairs while at the dentist :)... was how the doctor and his staff explained my treatment plan. They made sure to explain what I needed to get done for health purposes, and what I could get done, for aesthetics. Not sure about you guys, but it's great to find a doctor who takes the time to explain the difference between “needs” and “wants”, and is comfortable discussing all the fees associated with each before moving forward. Thank you Dr. Mendoza and staff for making me feel very comfortable and in control of my oral health. I will definitely be returning.</review>

<Review>I have been coming to iTooth for around 2-3 months now and in that time I have had to have a lot of work done. Dr. Mendoza and his staff are hands down the best of the best in Fresno. They are so courteous and professional, from the front desk all the way to the back rooms. I came here feeling embarrassed and they made me feel completely comfortable right away. No one has ever made me feel bad when working on my teeth. Dr. Mendoza always goes over every option and explains in detail what he is doing. My best experience was just recently I had a tooth extracted and the Dr. himself followed up with me via phone. I was not expecting that and was pleasantly surprised. After visiting iTooth I will never go anywhere else and always recommend this office to anyone who asks.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1553706731900, 'text': 'Kendra, We love hearing that our care has exceeded your standards.

After our family dentist retired I was slightly nervous about going to a new office, but iTooth Dentistry seemed extremely comfortable from the very beginning. The office is beautiful, modern and the staff is very helpful and nice. Dr.Mendoza took all the time I needed for explaining procedures and to answer questions. I felt encouraged to also bring in my family as new patients as well. Thank you iTooth Dentistry.</text>

The office is very clean and new and its definitely comfortable considering its a medical office. Dr. Mendoza was very informative when it came to everything I had done and I felt at ease knowing that he had my best interest at heart. I appreciated the walk throughs he gave me before starting any procedure; this is something I've never had any other dentist do for me in the past.
I'm so happy that his office accepted my insurance AND also accepts care credit. I was able to get all of my procedures done in less than two months with a great payment plan.
I would 100% recommend Dr. Mendoza's office to anybody looking for a new dentist or even looking to switch. You will not be disappointed.
PS the late hours on Wednesday saved me from having to use sick leave at work so that is definitely a bonus!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80945cd9dd36f21d:0x3290c0c3523c8dd8</gmap_id>< rating>

Accompanied my husband to his dental appointment. As I walked in the door I was greeted by a warm welcoming young receptionist, who offered me a Keurig coffee. I was impressed because there was no wait time. My husband was very satisfied with his visit and the explanation the dentist gave him about his treatment.

Will definitely come back for his crown. :)          iTooth rocks!<//Review>

I am an aspiring dental student interested in becoming a dentist. During my time shadowing Dr. Mendoza I gained insight into his practice as well as his character, and so I thought I would share my observations.

First, although his team is small they are committed to providing you with the best service possible. The staff is welcoming, helpful, and knowledgeable. Second, the way Dr. Mendoza treats his patients is exemplary--he is respectful and culturally sensitive. He listens to his patients, explains the problem, provides an immediate and long-term plan, and then allows the patient to decide what it is they want at that moment. No matter their ethnic background, his patients can relate to him. Third, he has a desire to impact his community. He does so by volunteering with nonprofits and mentoring those interested in dentistry, like myself. This speaks a lot about his character, as not many people are willing to give up their leisure time.

If you are looking for a dentist who genuinely cares about his patients and community, I highly recommend Dr. Mendoza at Itooth dentistry.< /text>

I haven't been to the dentist in many years and was somewhat apprehensive about all the work I may need to have done. However, Dr. Mendoza was great at prioritizing my dental needs, letting me know what needed to be done as soon as possible and what could wait.  I really appreciated this as some dentists may push you to do everything right away so they can make more money.  This was not the case with Dr. Mendoza. He was also very thorough in explaining the X-rays and always let me know what he was doing and why so I could fully understand the care I was receiving.  Dr. Mendoza is professional, knowledgable, caring, and passionate about his work.  He was also flexible with his schedule so that we could find appointment times that fit with my busy work schedule.  In addition, the equipment at iTooth is also all brand new and the facility is very clean.  I am happy I was able to find such a good dentist and will definitely be coming to iTooth for my future dental needs.< /review>

Dr. Mendoza and his staff at iTooth Dentistry were friendly and professional. I appreciated the extra effort that Dr. Mendoza took to explain to me the difference between an onlay, crown and filling before recommending a course of action that would most preserve my original tooth. He was meticulous and gentle in performing my filling. Excellent value for excellent service. I would highly recommend Dr. Mendoza and iTooth Dentistry.</review>

Simply put, probably one of the best dentists in Fresno if not the best. I had a receding gum line due to my brushing. Two dentists at Premier Dental couldn't fix my sensitivity problem after 3 visits and carving my tooth during one of those visits claiming that was the source of sensitivity (also making the surface very rough).

Dr. Mendoza removed the filling in about a minute because it was a very bad job done by Premier Dental, it came right off. Furthermore, I couldn't even tell there was a filling when he was done because it matched my tooth color and he polished my tooth so it feels smooth again like the rest of my teeth! I also had fillings done by Dr. Mendoza in the past and they have all been fantastic! I was really stupid to try another dentist.

If there is a small premium you pay at this clinic relative to the rest, just know it is because you are getting the best service and work done on your teeth. Why go somewhere else when you already know who the best is?< /Text>

<Response>None</Response><text>After being with the same dentist for over 10 years, we were tired of driving to madera for every visit even though we were happy with her. so when my husband and I decided to finally change our dentist to someone here in fresno, it was a big step because we only trusted our previous dentist but Dr. Mendoza has made the transition extremely easy. He's very knowledgeable and takes his time to really explain what and why any procedure needs to be done. We highly recommend him to all our family and friends.< /text><username>Erika Erika<//username>< Time>

I was looking for somewhere to get my teeth whitened and loved that this office was able to get me in right away. Dr Mendoza and his assistant Rosemary we're so gentle.

<text>I haven't been to the dentist in many years and was embarassed about all the work I may need to have done. Dr. Mendoza was very professional and prioritized my dental needs, letting me know what needed to be done as soon as possible and what could wait. He was also very thorough in explaining the X-rays and always let me know what he was doing and why so I could fully understand the care I was receiving.  Dr. Mendoza is professional, knowledgable, caring, and passionate about his work.  He was also flexible with his schedule so that we could find appointment times that fit with my busy work schedule.  In addition, the equipment at iTooth is also all brand new and the facility is very clean.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Over the Thanksgiving weekend I went to iTooth Dentistry in Fresno, CA.  The waiting room and reception area were both clean and well laid out.  I met the dentist, Dr. Mendoza within a few minutes of my arrival to the office as he came out to meet two new patients.  It was a nice touch.  I was brought back to a very spacious, clean room.  The chair and equipment were brand new.  Everything looked very clean.   Even the X-ray machine was neatly tucked away.

FYI* Itooth Dentistry has a separate special room for scanning teeth to make retainers (3M TruDef Digital Scanner). My fiancé was getting her teeth scanned to make a retainer to close a gap in her front teeth.

Carine was the hygienist who listened to my dental history and asked some logical follow up questions.  She spent about 45 minutes on my appointment, counting and numbering my teeth, measuring the gaps in between my teeth and gum line, cleaning my teeth and making recommendations for keeping my teeth and gums healthy.  There was lots to talk about in my mouth, but I heard no ridicule or judgement from the hygienist or the dentist.

I was impressed with the relaxed  and professional atmosphere of the iTooth Dentistry office.  This is a very well run dental office.   I was thoroughly impressed with the entire experience.  I will return for my bi-annual visits.</Text>< username>

I had a toothache this last weekend, and every place that my mom and i called was closed. Luckily I found this place on the internet and was open on Saturday morning. The office was very nice and even had some massage dental chairs which I've never experienced.

I got my tooth fixed I was able to go out to the movies with my friends at night. rock on itooth!!!!< /Text>

<text>If you're looking for great dental care in the city of Fresno I'd highly recommend itooth Dentistry! The customer service at itooth is outstanding! When you walk into Dr. Mendozas office it is very clean and it has a TV to entertain you while you wait. Dr. Mendoza is very honest and professional with his patients. He really thrives and loves what he does and when you have a dentist like him you know you're going to get the best dental care!<//text>< gmap_id>

Great service. Wish they would be a bit more patient with people who had never been to there store before and wants to know the different proteins available. Not just "what else" and no time to think. Besides that it is a good place for food.< /text>

This was the first time my wife and I had poke. We loved it. There was a good amount of toppings to select from and they were generous with their portions. The price was about right, around $10 a bowl. The service was fine and the were friendly to us. Just watch out for the metal on the door. It snagged me and ripped a small hole in my shirt. Otherwise this is a great place to get some poke. Very delicious.< /review>

I used to love Poke Ave, but something must have changed because the poke I got here actually tasted gross. I have never said that about poke ever. The fish I have tasted at other poke stores has never been overtly "fishy". That wasn't so with this place. Aside from the strong fish taste there was no other flavor. Usually the mix of sauces and ingredients is able to salvage it. Maybe it was just an off day for them but I'm sorely disappointed.<//review>

This is some delicious poke! The food is fresh and there are many sauces which all taste great. There are lots of spicy options which is important to me. I wish the portions of fish were larger considering the price of a large bowl. This place is definitely worth a visit.<//Review>

Pretty good poke. Generous scoop sizes. Good hot sauce. They charge extra for avocado though. They also have some Hawaiian-style tuna poke options which are good, but sometimes they put the other sauce-mixed sashimi right on top!< /text>

<text>They get 0 for ambiance, but the staff is friendly and the poke is fresh!  I always get it to go. The presentation is nice as well.. I like the fact that they pay attention to details such as packaging.
This is becoming a regular pick up place for me ( when there's not a line that is! )</text>< time>

<Review>My absolutely favorite spot to get some. Fish. Did you know by the fact Poke places are came from Hawaii. I was always thinking that it's some sort of Japanese places. This specific spot has a very nice clean restaurant with a vary large portions for the price. I noticed that they have I think it's a miso soup machine. I haven't tried it yet. I would greatly recommend this spot to friends and family for a quick quality bite. The food taste fresh and quality is great. I had a chance to eat there twice, once with my family and everything was veey good.<//Review>< Resp>

Good service.  Explained that you get more with the bowl than the burrito for the same price because you fit as much in the burrito.</review>

Everything was one day away from being in desperate need of being trashed I had a stomach ache the day after I ate it I'm pretty sure I would have had food poisoning if I have waited one more day to go in and eat there so I would be a little cautious of what you're getting there and be prepared that it may not be as fresh as other places are<//text>

< Review>
The sushi here is really fresh and I love how they have a big variety of toppings. Avocado is extra but you can get masago, seaweed, edamame, cilantro, furikake, spicy or regular crab, cucumber, etc. The regular and large bowls are the same size, only difference is the number of scoops of sushi, 3 vs 5. They also have 4-5 different intensities of hot sauce...something for everyone!<//Review>

Perfect for lunch time and amazing portion sizes. I usually commute to this area alot and knowing that theres a poke stop nearby (not that kind of poke stop btw) makes me happy. They have this variation also of the burrito where its like a giant sushi roll basically. I dont recommend this one so much because it is much smaller than that of the bowl and its the same price.<//Review>

High prices, super long wait, ended up walking out because ordered a simple breakfast 45 minutes later it never got there we got an apology that it was on its way waited another 15 minutes and left very disappointing. I'll get pizza to go there but nothing else no dining in ever again<//review>

Stopped by for dinner on trip. Basic food made well. Good service with a smile. Server stated appreciation for our visit after asking where we're from.  Place looks like a local favorite with cool fireman pin-up decor.< /Text>

< Review>
I have been a customer of this place for years.  My family and I love the food at Tonys Pizza.  but there is really a serious problem that is going to ruin this restaurant and it is the waiter named ABEL
Every time I go to the restaurant and he serves me, he is very rude to me and my family.  He always seems very confused and acts rude like he doesn't care about customer service.

Today I placed an order over the phone and ordered an Enginer steak with eggs when I went to pick up the order and wanted to pay, he said he had no change.  that I had to go get change.  I decided to pay with the card.

When I saw my food I noticed that the steak was completely burned.  my plate was a mess.  I called him to tell him if he could come back so they could place my order again and he very upset said my order was fine. I went back and showed it to him.  He told me that they would do it again but that he had to wait about 35 minutes for it to be ready..
anyway.  I feel disappointed in this place, I never back!!</Review>

<Text>The wait staff ignored my boyfriend and I half the time and just served other guest and they took forever to just even give us our drinks and they weren't even busy, sat there for at least 10 mins or so waiting for our drinks. Will not be dining in again.< /Text>< Pictures>

This place is my favorite. I eat in many restaurants but to this place I go the most. The crew is very cordial and the cuisine they serve is so good. I never miss an opportunity to have a good dinner in this place. Highly recommended.< /Text>

I ordered 2 extra large combination pizzas and paid $72 and it was definitely not worth what I paid for. The only thing that was worth eating was the pizza sticks. I would never order a pizza from here again. They have a great breakfast though.< /Text>

<Text>Love this place! They have some of the best pizza in town, as well as a full, diverse menu. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, and even have an arcade area for the kids. Tony’s is one of our favorite places to get together for our Sunday family breakfasts!  And they even have lightning fast delivery!  Good food, awesome service, and great atmosphere.< /Text>< Pictures>

The food was great but you would have to wait forever for service. I personally witnessed a family that has to send the children to go ask for a to-go box. There was a couple that had to flag down a waiter for coffee after waving for a waitress for about 5 minutes. They were all talking at the front. Again the food was great, especially the bisquets & gravy! The rest left a lot to be desired.< /Text>

I recommend their Hawaiian style pizza. Its delicious. I used to like to get their Chile verde pizza but this last time it wasn't that great needed more sauce but besides that. 10/10 hands down</review>

<Review>This is the second time I have been there and it's the second time I have to wait a while to be seated and for someone to come and take my order and when the server brought the food, it wasn't what my husband and I ordered! Maybe it wasn't the cook's fault, maybe it was the waitress who didn't pay attention. Anyways, the food was good, I have to give them that. That's the reason I went there for a second time.<//Review>< pics>

This restaurant is interesting. From the pictures and what I knew about the other Tony’s locations I assumed it was a pizza joint only, which is not the case. You must wait to be seated and the restaurant has a full menu that includes salads, sandwiches, pastas and also pizzas. The pizza was really good, but it was unnecessary, in my opinion, to pay gratuity for pizza and sodas. I prefer the other Tony’s locations that are just pizza, but can’t fault this one for providing variety to people.< /Text>

We were there for the first time, and the waitress never came back to see how we were doing, or if we needed anything else. Food very good thank you.<//text>< Pictures>

The service was decent, the prices for what you get were alittle high in my opinion but food was delicious, while it's not my first option of go to places I do recommend if your a foodie or just looking to try a new place, I do plan to go back and try their pizza and if anything changes I will update my review<//text>

< review>
Really need to work on customer service with the staff!! Called order in to pickup. When I arrived at the time I was told to pickup,  I  was asked to wait. After 15 minutes,  I  asked about my order,  and was told it had been ready for 30 minutes!!  To make the event even more frustrating,  they do not take cash!!  Tried to pay with a $50. bill, and would not take it. Walked out and went to Subway to get dinner for the family.</review>

The first time I came to Tony's Firehouse Restraunt was to have a bite to eat and I needed a place to study. The service was great and the waitress was really nice. The food was delicious and I will definately recommend it to my friends and family.< /Text>

< review>
My wife had a biscuit and gravy! She
liked it! I had a chili verde omelette! It was certainly different! This was my first experience with pulled pork chili verde Not pleasant! Watery flavor, not hot and gommed up with to much  cheese! Chili Verde is best with chunks of pork! Biscuit and gravy okay! Hash browns tasteless!</review>

I have ate at Tonys loads of times. Never had a problem but now they can't substitute or ala carte a fish and shrimp taco for you to try. Just because they loose half of a fish fillet. What happened to customer service and the customer being able to get what they want. Wasn't asking for anything unreasonable. Just wanted to try them before ordering a full meal. For a family spending close to 100.00 every time we go that seems crazy. Tonys isn't cheap either.<//text>

We enjoyed the food and the only issue is how the interior of the restaurant looked. The inside was not open for dining and luckily they do have a nice little attached patio. However the interior was full of boxes and in a state of disarray! I would suggest cleaning this up to make it more appealing.<//text>

I admire this spot! They serve superb food, their menu is large, The chef in that place is a professional, I enjoy a lot trying all their dishes. The food is always tasty, the attitude towards the clients  is efficient. I often go to  this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it with no hesitation.<//Review>

Pretty good. I’ve only had a few things so I'm definitely not going to judge from 3 things off the menu. Got the Chow Mien, Chicken lunch special. Chicken was very dry/had no flavor and my 2 year old said it was too dry too. Will be trying something else next time!<//Text>

I got Mango Sticky Rice, since he had never had it before. It was great! We also figured we would order dinner, I got the Massaman curry with tofu and he got the pad thai. Both were great! I ate my curry leftovers the next day and it was still amazing.</Review>

are these 5 stars fake reviews or what?
worst packaging.. ordered a pad thai and it looked like someone didnt finish their plate and the server picked it up and packed it for me. disgusting and it smelled and looked horrible ( like old food )
also packaged with no receipt, no utensils, no napkins..<//Text>

<Review>Of all the places that we've tried since returning from 4 years in England. This is the closest to the amazing Thai places over there. I'm not sure how this compares to actual Thai so...you might have to take this review with a grain of salt. The wife and I ordered the Masamune Curry and my daughter got the tempura shrimp.</Review>< GmapID>

We got seated very fast. After we got seated it took more than 10 minutes for the service to take out order. When the order came my wife got her order, I had to wait 10 minutes for my food arrive after my wife got her food. The lady could barely even understand a word of English meaning the service lady. However the food was very good but I do not want to eat at that restaurant again just because the service was so frustrating. When I asked for my food because it was going on probably about 5 minutes after my wife got her food I asked the lady where my food was I would like to eat at the same time with my wife, she told me to calm down and the food was coming and don't become upset.</text>

<review>This is a great little Thai restaurant. So is their other restaurant on Mira Costa. They are every bit as good as The Royal Thai restaurants in Laguna and Newport (which are also great). Idiots from Los Angeles drive through San Clemente and are so jealous that they don't live in the most laid-back coastal village in California that they just have to find something to complain about. There is no reason why both of these restaurants shouldn't get five-star reviews from everyone. They are very good and very consistent. Over the years, we have eaten at these two restaurants easily over 100 times and never had a bad meal. The guys that pretend to be experts on Thai cuisine and nit pick the menu are the most self-delusional. This is what happens when you live where you have to fight traffic both in and out just to leave your house. You go crazy. And you wonder why the locals hate tourists.< /review><GmapID>0x80dcf39c35eea60f:0x81223c515603e293< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've been to every Thai restaurant in this area, New York and Seattle for many many years ,I even cook Thai food as a Chef.. This is the best Thai restaurant in the area in my opinion, they are so friendly, the food is so fresh and it is on point every time. You guys are five star, thank you !!!</Review>

Flavor is a bit lacking too, seems fairly bland for my style. Spicey level is 1-5 scale instead of 1-10, but very accurate comparatively to everywhere I've been.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dcf39c35eea60f:0x81223c515603e293</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Best Thai food in San Clemente. The standard pad Thai and such are good, but my favorites are the BBQ chicken and the summer rolls.</review>

<review>Consistantly very good!

So our first visit was a few months ago when we first moved to SC. We were looking for a new Thai "go-to" close by. I came really close to giving it a 4 star review as everything was good almost very good but nothing remarkable. We had the chicken pad thai. The flavors were not quite there and a little bland compared to other Thai places we have visited in other areas.

However, on our visit Saturday night, the meal was great and Flavors vibrant!

LOCATION & AMBIANCE (Rating 3.5) Tucked away in a strip mall that is not easy to find the Thai Palace is not quite a hole in the wall, but definitely not fine dining. Both times we've been there it's been moderately busy with a good take out business it seems. Most of the seating is on the side and back of the building, so we've found that the waitresses are not very responsive as there is no line of site for them to be able to do their work and keep an eye on your needs as well.

SERVICE  (Rating 3) They have always been nice, but as mentioned above, great service is practically impossible if the waitresses have no line of site with you as they have allot of counter work to do as well.

YELLOW CURRY CHICKEN (Rating 4.5)
* First Visit (Rating 3.5) We ordered the Yellow chicken curry which was good. The sauce was heavy, in a good way and flavors were good and it did come with rice.
* 10/3/2015 (Rating 4.5) The flavors were vibrant, the spices perfectly balanced as just the right amount of potatoes were added which can defeat the spices very easily.

TAM KHA SOUP w CHICKEN (Rating 4.5)
* 10/03/2015 Visit (Rating 4.5) Tonight I found the Tam KHA soup to be excellent. The balance of sweet and spicy was superb and the soup consistency was just right. The quality of some of the cabbage used was not up to par and the chicken was just a little over cooked which happens so easily, but I'd order this again in a minute. Much better tonight than the first visit.
* First Visit (Rating 3.75) We had the Tam Kar soup with chicken as well, which was also good. Not quite as sweet as some others I've had, but very good. All of the chicken in every dish was over cooked which can happen in these types of dishes very easily. I think we'll give it another shot and revisit this rating.

CHICKEN PHAD THAI (Rating 4.25) The chicken phad thai is wonderful. They use the red noodles and it's consistency and spices used are nicely done. This dish is not spicy and to be honest it needs a little more heat, so plan on adding that.<//review>< Response>

One of the better Thai restaurants here.  Plenty of parking and easy access.  There lunch specials are a great deal.  Favorites are Pad See Ew, Tom Ka Gai soup, string cucumber salad and birds nest appetizer.  Worth a try.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I stayed in a room with king size bed and a small terrace. The room was comfortable and clean. They left several articles for personal cleaning in the bathroom that I appreciated. As well as a iron with iron table and a hairdryer. The fridge, microwave and coffee machine were in good shape too.
I took the breakfast every morning. It was the same every time bus they had enough to  choose something different every 2 days.
I enjoy my stay here. The personal was amiable and helpful.</review>< pictures>

<Text>It's really not worth it to stay here. Pay the extra 10 to 30% and get a decent room in a decent hotel, where the AC is not as loud as a jack hammer, and the tenant in the next room doesn't knock on your door at night and asks you to lower the music on the small radio the hotel provides, and where you don't have to listen to your other neighbor's phone conversations. The staff are cross- a good morning can go a long way. Breakfast is not really breakfast, not worth it and everything is stale. I had a second floor room and there was no elevator so I had to struggle carrying my luggage up for my 4 day stay. I kept the shades off because I didn't feel safe with all the balconies connected through the same deck and only separated by a 2 ft divider.

Red Cottage Inn was very nice. It’s price reasonable for the area. It was centrally located. It was a wonderful room although it had a small shower. The staff friendly. It was quiet and had a sweet garden area.< /review>

<Review>It is exactly what you need and should expect at the price point. Nothing more and nothing less. Rooms are clean but dated. Staff is friendly and helpful. Great location, near a lot of good food. Only downside is you can miss it if you don't know what to look for and you can only turn in going from one direction.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

A very pleasant stay. Very homey and cozy. Might not look grand, but I would say the room was better than most "fancy" looking hotels. Comfortable bed, bathroom was experience was great as well.< /text>

Wonderful cottage with your own private patio with fence around it. Incredibly clean accomodations, great breakfast and very friendly staff! Plus you can't beat the price for Palo Alto area! Highly recommended.</Text>

<text>The hotel was back off the main Street and very quite. The check-in and out process was quick and easy. The rooms were nice and had private patios around a nice courtyard. The property was very nicely maintained. This is one of the cheaper options in the area but you definitely get your moneys worth with clean rooms, a nice basic breakfast, and the pet friendlyness.< /text><response>None</response>< pictures>

The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. They adjusted the temperature for or hot water and carried all of our luggage from the second to the first floor when a first floor room opened up. This is a small thing, but they always have a candy bowl set out on the front desk too, which made us feel immediately welcome!</Review>

We were not sure of this hotel from the outside.  To us it didn't look great, but it was a welcome surprise!  Staff is great and everything is up dated  (at least in the room we were in).  Granite counter tops and large flat screen TV.  It has almost every amenity a 4 star hotel would have except an elevator.</Text>

<rate>3< /rate><review>Room was clean and the service at the front desk was great. It is tucked away from the main road which can confuse Ride Services about where to pickup. Best to walk out to the street and meet them. The CalTrain runs nearby pretty regularly and you will hear the horn blare every time. The walls are kind of thin and you can often hear the adjacent rooms. TV's are mounted to the wall sharing with your headboard. That means of someone nextdoor has theirs on, you hear it as well as they do. Breakfast and snacks are available throughout the day in the lobby. They always had a tank of infused water as well.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fa4a0a4a8af07:0x289beb8d2eded60e<//Gmap_id></record>

The red hotel sign is easy to miss, however! Comfortable beds and nice rooms with desks and small refrigerators; some rooms have small garden patios. Larger garden patio in center of the hotel complex as well. Free wired and wireless Internet, and free continental breakfast. Nice large bathrooms. Friendly, helpful staff. Because it's right on El Camino Real, it has easy access to Palo Alto, Stanford, and Redwood City. Also relatively easy access to highway 101. I've been there on several visits over a couple of months and have always been happy to return.< /Review>

The outside is deceiving. The rooms are very nice, well kept, and include all of the amenities you would expect on and Inn. Breakfast isn't extravagant, but is solid. The room includes a keurig with k-cups, which is a step up from most hotel coffee machines.<//Review>

<text>Nice, clean, comfortable rooms and beds. HD Dish 36" flat screens, small microwave, bar-size fridge; no utensils, pans or dishes. Friendly and helpful staff. Pool and workout room. Wifi has some speed issues, but usually works fine. Free breakfast. On a very busy street (El Camino Real) and turning left out of parking lot is dangerous.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

We have here three times.  Very nice room.  Not fancy but comfortable, clean, quiet and reasonably priced.
I recommend this property.<//review>

Front desk indicated there'd been some confusion over a change to my reservation but the straightened it out ok in just a few minutes. But because of that, if definitely suggest calling ahead to make sure any changes are applied as expected.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>My husband had to go into surgery at Stanford had to use special soap twice before the surgery so he had to take two showers. I went down to get more towels so he could take a shower in the morning and was told they don't have any towels. That they were locked up until the manager got there tomorrow. I had to dry him off with washcloths. The shower heads are made for people who are tall. I'm 5 foot 4 inches and the shower stall is enclosed and the water would only hit me in my face and back of my head. The next day I asked for a room with a at least a bathtub or a lower shower head so I could feel clean. Since I was going to be staying there for four days anyways. They told me there was nothing they could do they were booked. And each day I would get up in the morning at most there were eight cars in the parking lot. And it night at most there were eight cars in the parking lot. If you like very firm beds this is the place for you to stay. I had to take off for pillows and lay on them to try and get some sleep but what I'm most upset with was the shower situation.< /review>< name>

Good location. Rooms are clean. Staff are friendly and I liked the breakfast. They have the cheap annoying soap that can't be rinsed  though</text>

< review>
I can't speak for other rooms in this establishment but we stayed in Room 126 and were very disappointed with several issues.
I will speak to our biggest concern which was the shower.

When we turned on the spigot the pipes in the wall rattled so hard and loud it was like a locomotive coming through the wall.  Not only was it difficult to take a shower at this level of noise- right next to your ear- but the water pressure was about half of normal (LOW) and so it took longer to complete the task.
This was not only an issue for us, but I can not imagine how the room next to us would fair if someone in 126 were to take a late evening or very early morning shower.
I phoned the girl at the front desk.  She was familiar with the issue and gave me the pat response:  I am so sorry for your inconvenience.  I will have them look at it again, but it is a problem with HIGH water pressure.   And that was it.
Since this was probably a low/level/wage employee I decided to deal with it at check out.

Next morning the man at the desk asked me if we enjoyed our stay.
I replied in as polite a tone I could manage-  Do you really want to know?
He didn't say a word and kept on completing the check out.

Why ask if you all you want to hear is, yes?

After a long pause I told him Room 126 never should have been rented.
Nor was this fair to people who would stay in the next room.
His coworker's response was they put it on their list and would take care of it.
No reduction in the room charge, nor an apology.

The shower was a problem yet the way it was handled was worse.

Next visit, for $169, we will drive a few miles farther and stay at the Sofitel.< /review>

Daniel is the best hairdresser ever! He is so friendly and has the most beautiful heart and soul. Even more, he's a professional at cutting hair. A few sips here and there and he is done ... my hair looks amazing every time!  If u are in need of a change, he's your guy!< /Review>

<response>None<//response><Review>Daniel’s work is consistently great! He is knowledgeable about all aspects of what will make my hair look it’s best. He’s always calm, and his ego is not involved. Consequently, I can change something, such as color tone, style specifics, products used, etc, he’s fine with it. Since I’ve been a long time Willo client, any stylist who knows me is aware that I’m specific!
Because of his skill level and demeanor, he would be an asset to any Salon’s environment, and fit in easily.
Regardless of whatever state of being I may be in, when I go see Daniel, I’m more calm when I leave, and my hair is great! I’m regularly the recipient of compliments, as a result. Daniel is my friend, I value his talent and personal integrity!</Review>< username>

<Text>I have been coming here to get beautiful for almost 2 years.  I walk in feeling like Norm from Cheers.  Everyone knows your name and you will always be created with a smile an something to drink.  Shay is always creative and gives great suggestions on your next hair adventure.   The environment is amazing and I will be continuing to come every 6 weeks as long to see Shay. You will not be disappointed!  Excited to see the upcoming renovations to the salon!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

< review>
Marcos did my hair during my visit and read the situation perfectly. He gave me a simple yet effective consultation and kept a comfortable amount of conversation throughout that did not feel forced. He asked how I felt about my current style and if there was any way he could make me feel more confident with it. It was a simple trim and style this time but we also discussed future plans for my hair. I felt comfortable the entire time and will definitely go back to get the color we discussed.

Additionally, the receptionist promptly asked if I wanted tea or water when I came in and hyped up the cut once I was done. Little things like this obviously increase the quality of service and make the whole experience feel like I don’t have to dread it in the future. Willo has been my salon for 2 years now and I have no intention of ever going anywhere else.< /review>

I came in having had a horrible experience from another salon. Lira took such good care of me. She fixed my color and my cut. I walked out super happy with my hair, the customer service and the over all atmosphere of the salon. It was welcoming and relaxing. I will definitely be coming here from now on! 🙂< /text>

I always have such a great experience at Willo.  My hairdresser Bailey is the best!  She always knows exactly what my hair needs to keep my hair lighter and healthier.  I can always trust her to make my hair look amazing.< /review>

She mixed the perfect color for my hair, always cuts and styles it perfectly, and is always friendly and knowledgeable.  It is a treat to see her. I also love heated eye towel and hand massage while getting my hair washed. The complementary tea is delicious as well. Great salon with great stylists!< /Review><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

This was my 3rd visit and I honestly wish I could say that I was, once again, completely happy with my service. Unfortunately for me, I left your salon dissatisfied and surprised that I was still charged the full cost of my service for a very bad haircut even after expressing my dissatisfaction to the stylist and to whom I  assumed was the salon manager/supervisor.   The only compensation I was offered was to come back in two weeks to correct the choppy uneven haircut.  I want to add that I  had complete faith in my stylist because she did such a beautiful job the first time, I was going in for a 1/2" trim.  I certainly didn't expect it to turn out awful!  I also did not appreciate my stylist's sudden change in attitude towards me. Up till the time I questioned the choppy cut, we were having such a pleasant conversation? She became quite and didn't offer an apology.  All she and the other stylist/manager did was try to convince me that the cut was cute!  Seriously who would be comfortable coming back when you didn't even accept responsibility for such a bad haircut and you still charged me!<//Text>

I love that as soon as I come in I’m greeted and they ask if I want water, coffee, or tea. It’s always clean and Lira is amazing! I’ve been going to her for years and she’s very tentative to my hair needs and requests. I’ve opted for some pretty drastic things and I’m comfortable talking those details out with her and she always does a phenomenal job on my hair. I wouldn’t go to anyone else!< /Review>

I was a walk- in customer and they were able to see me very quickly.  So thankful for the kind and courteous service that I received from them. I was very happy with the hairstyle by Kathy. The shampoo and conditioning treatment was devine! A very happy customer here!<//review>

Since moving to the Sacramento area almost a year ago, I’ve been going to Willo for my haircuts. I’ve always been pleased with their service and stylists. I have curly hair which can be difficult to manage. However I’ve never had a bad cut. They’re also very reasonably priced. And they have convenient hours which is helpful since my work schedule can be varied. I’d highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great salon</Text>

<review>I only gave 2 stars just because of Heidi fixing my hair which was worked on by Kathy yesterday. I went in for a bob, came out with a Larry, I mean pixie, and was totally fine with it until I showered and hubby saw the back of my hair. I actually ended up with two different haircut, a bob and a pixie that does not talk to each other. Called and argued with the receptionist that I can't go to work totally looking like I got a haircut from a drunk guy on Xanax from a hair-cutting school and it has to be fixed today, a Sunday. She said they are busy and they can't accommodate me today, and if they could it will have to be later in the afternoon, the same time I have to nap my baby. Or I have to come in on Monday or go to Fair Oaks where the stylist that worked on my hair is working today so she can fix it. I was upset! I told her I'm coming in anyway and they have to fix it TODAY. So I went in, met Heidi and she fixed my haircut the best that she can. It was a huge difference and I didn't want to, but I cried and hugged her anyway. If you want a bob, a pixie, a short hair or just want a good haircut, ask for Heidi. There was a lady who was having her hair colored said "Oh honey, it's not so bad...it only looks awfully bad because it's your hair." I almost smacked her stupid mouth. I'm not a hairstylist by any shape, way or form but good lord, any person with an eyesight can see what a terrible job this was for a person who's supposed to have 10 years of experience cutting hair.< /review><gmapID>0x809ada55769a4409:0xe89e598287acfcdd< /gmapID>< resp>

I can always count in Willo salon to make me feel fabulous. From the tea and water,  to the hand treatments while you're conditioning, to the friendly and professional service. Mariah is my stylist. She is kind, funny, and really fabulous. My hair always looks and feels amazing after I see her. My hair is fine, thin, and curly so it's not easy to handle,  but she does it effortlessly. I highly recommend a trip to Willo if you want to look and feel your best!<//text>

<review>Heidi Rodriquez is a very detailed stylist. She always makes sure you are comfortable with what she is doing and asks you for your input before beginning to do anything with your hair. Heidi also is very attentive to your needs and makes you feel pampered for the time you are in her chair. Would highly recommend Heidi for you stylist.< /review></record>

Heidi did a wonderful job on my hair. She worked miracles on a prior bad cut . The cut did not come from any Willo/Aveda Salon. I read all of the reviews before booking at  this Willo Salon. I am happy with my results that I booked my color with Heidi for this week!! The salon has great atmosphere and the are very mindful about offering coffee , tea or water! The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  This is now my trusted salon.  Thank you to Heidi and the staff, who made me feel at ease .</Text>

I've been going to Willo for the last four years because they have some very talented employees. While some of their colorists are fantastic, the company is absolutely horrible to work with. Yesterday I got charged a cancellation fee of $25 even though I didn't cancel my appointment. I was late for my appointment and I called to let them know I would be late and then my colorist decided to do less color than we had originally planned to stay on schedule, which was totally fine. I even offered to style my own hair at home to keep them on schedule. I understand charging  for cancellations but not in addition to $105 for a partial highlight. I'll find a new salon.</text>

<Review>I love this salon! They are always very hospitable when you arrive - offering coffee, tea or water.
The hair products are high quality - my hair is always shiny and soft after a wash, cut and blow dry.
Claire is amazing and I highly recommend her! She has been doing my hair for years and is great with color, highlights, low lights, ombre, you name it!  And, she listens to your request and will do what you ask - like thick/wide streaks as opposed to highlights.<//Review><Name>Angelina Mejia</Name>< time>

In the past year my hair has gone through a horror show of bad stylist but because of Willo Beauty Bar and my stylist Shay Danielle I feel like my hair is exactly what I’ve dreamed of! I couldn’t be happier with the service I received at this amazing salon!! I have already recommended 5 people and it’s only been a day. Shay saw one picture of my inspiration and knew exactly what to do! She exceeded every expectation I could have imagined! I feel so confident in my hair and I know I have a regular salon and stylist I can visit with confidence! ❤️❤️< /Review>

I had an amazing experience with Marcos at Willow Aveda in the Loehmanns Plaza. He took his time with the head massage, held great conversation and gave me a hair cut that he knew I needed which looks amazing. I will definitely be coming back.< /text>

<Response>None</Response><Review>My hair looks great, but the service was very mediocre. I was quoted $65 over the phone for a cut and all-over-color. When she quoted me this price, I was told it could be more if I have a lot of hair (totally understandable). Once I was in the chair, my stylist told me $80. Cool - no problem. I got to the register and my total was $105. I'm all for a learning environment, but debating on how to formulate my color for 25 minutes with another senior stylist doesn't feel very comforting. Don't get me wrong, every employee was kind, but the confidence that your stylist has reflects on the customers trust to proceed with the service. My stylist needed to get her plan of action approved before we could begin, and at check-out, was not in the system to perform color services because she was so new. Overall, I was disappointed with the professionalism of such a classy looking salon.</Review>< UserId.>

I went to the salon for help with my color which I was not able to get right on my own (drying out my hair, no color depth).  Stylist was very nice and supportive, providing me with treatments that improved my hair's condition.  After 2 1/2 months when my hair was finally ready for color I booked a full foil color for which I was very excited to get. $125 and 1 1/2 hours later, I had bleached roots and a blow dry.  I had spent TONS of money on treatments, blow outs, and products, and I came out with roots that were not bleached out as well as I had done myself, no depth, and another appointment for my "full foils."  I cancelled the next day having learned a very expensive lesson.< /Review>

<Text>I have been going to Willo Aveda Salon for 7 years. Laura is an incredible stylist and really cool person. I have gone to other Aveda salons previously and never felt welcome. Willo is different. They are professional yet personable and relaxed. All in all, a fantastic experience and I highly recommend Willo @ Loehmann’s Plaza!< /Text>< Pictures>

On the suggestion of a co-worker, I went to Willo for a blowout. I made an appointment for the same day, right after work, and the staff was helpful and flexible when I called back to change my appointment to an earlier time.

I generally don't do much with my long hair, so I was a bit worried that I would be pushed to cut/color/treat my hair, but that wasn't the case at all!  My stylist Alisha gave me an aromatherapy scalp massage, washed, dried and curled my hair, without ever lecturing me. She asked what my plans and desires were for my style, but happily suggested what she would do if given license to decide the style.I went with her suggestion and It looked wonderful!

I felt so confident in her hair skills, I asked if she would do my makeup as well, and it also turned out better than I expected! Even though Alisha is new to Willo, I highly recommend her as a stylist and beauty artist! I will certainly be back!</Text>

I got my hair done by Laura C. and I love it!! I get really nervous when I go to a new place and with Laura she made me feel very comfortable! We talked about what I wanted done and wanted more of a change for myself. She gave me a super cute hair cut and I love the color!! I felt amazing when I walked out! Laura C. is super cute, very friendly, and officially my new hair girl! Thank you! :)</review>

Marcos is amazing, as was the rest of the team. I walked in hoping to get a same day appointment. They were able to accommodate me. They let me know about a special on their botanical treatment. The host got me a cup of Aveda tea (my favorite tea of all!). And then Marcos transformed my hair from icky to super cute. Even though I only did a cut & treatment, my color looks refreshed & the condition of my hair is great (yay, no more frizz). And honestly it was just so relaxing (yay scalp massage). Will absolutely go back & recommend Marcos.</Text>

I dread searching for a new stylist when I move to a new city, and really put this off, but WIllo was fantastic. I do think for a men's haircut they are a bit expensive, but Shay definitely did an excellent job so it's not so bad as a once in a while splurge.</Review>

<Text>Like most creative services, your experience probably will depend on the stylist you have. I have been seeing Claire for... 5 years? She is awesome. Highly recommend her.

Also Aveda products are the only ones which don't fry my hair (I go from brown to blonde). I've tried several other lines with very sad results. Aveda is among the more expensive products out there but who wants fried hair? And I mean what they use on your hair for dyeing. I don't purchase their take home products (waaaaaaaaaaay too expensive, *O*M*G*). Sorry, was that a little over dramatic?

So anyway, I recommend the salon generally, and Claire specifically. :)</Text>< gmap_id>

Made my way in to Willo Beauty Bar this last Sunday afternoon! Wow, what an experience!! It was my first time at this particular salon, but I've followed my stylist Morganne for the last few years and she's now currently a part of the Willo family! For starters, it's in the Loehmann's Plaza in Sacramento, where many other shops & restaurants are conveniently located right outside the salon. In my case, it provided much to do for my husband & son while I got a couple hrs of "me" time.

Anyways, back to the salon. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. The place has a very classy & relaxing vibe to it. The first thing you see when you walk in is this long bar down the middle of the salon, with mirrors and chairs lined all the way down. Not your average salon set up. But quite honestly, I really liked it!

Morganne did a spectacular job, as usual! I went in to get my ombré touched up. She lightened the blonde, brought it up higher, pulled out the brassiness in my hair, styled my bangs, and gave me a much needed cut. I absolutely love it! Perfect look for summer! She was super friendly the entire time, and did all that I asked for. Prices stayed true to what I was quoted from the start. Which is nice!

Overall great experience with both my stylist Morganne and the salon in general! I'll continue to go here from now on and I'd highly recommend it to anyone else :)< /Review>

<Text>I love this Church!! Everyone there is absolutely Amazing and very welcoming. I started coming to this church because of my son and daughter in law and I am so grateful for this church whenever I feel overwhelmed and need to see or hear an uplifting service they always have the right words I need to hear from God and His Message.</Text>< name>

I've been with the Celebration family going all the way back to 1995. Randy and Cherie, and now their children Nick, Sharissa, and Andrew have continued to keep a movement going forward that truly exists to help people live the life that God has for them.</Review>

<text>I Love Celebration church! This is by far the greatest Church experience Ive ever had! Its kinda big but has the feel of a small personal service! What I love best is I can sleep in & go to a later service on Sunday! The dream team is there to pray before & get you pumped up! The music is Amazing! Its like going to a Concert everytime! They really reach out & do there part for the whole community. Big parking lot with friendly help to get you where u need to go. They even have a shuttle to ride.<//text>< user_name>

<review>Ever since my boyfriend brought me to this church I won't go to any other one. We come from San Francisco just for church. I felt like a Demon was in my body, so we got prayer. I feel like something was lifted off my chest. I'm free!!! I'm hopeing my life starts over again, and all or most of my prayers are answered.</review>< pictures>

My Home Church! They really turned my frown upside down when I first visited 4 years ago.  If you're searching for a church home, definitely consider visiting Celebration. Not even going to beg, just come for any one of their services.  If it's for you, you'll know you'll want to come back again 7 days later LOL. That's how it was for me!</review>

<Text>Why anyone would rate this church with less than five stars I do not know??? I've been to thousands of churches across the United States and other countries and this is the only church I ever felt is actually preaching the proper word of God in my opinion and is the first and only church that I have ever felt comfortable enough with to allow them to baptize me for the first time ever.</Text><userid>100332604783704845547<//userid>< name>

<text>I like this church.  I have been attending for a couple of months.  However, I am really disappointed.  Every single service they are preaching on tithes.  Lately, they spend 30 minutes each service begging for money.  It is getting to be annoying and completely over done.  I will see how it is after the holidays.    Meanwhile, going somewhere else on Sunday.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I love this place we have been going since the first week they opened up. We always get the pot stickers.... They are always hot and tasty! I love the Thai Basil Fried Rice and my wife has gotten the Pad Thai and Green Curry. Everything is fresh and the service is outstanding! The owner saw me and always says hello now! Very nice and highly recommended! Support local family owned businesses! It takes a lot to open a restaurant and this place deserves local love! It's a nice little restaurant!<//Text>

<Review>I had bought some pineapple fried rice from this place through door dash a few days ago and absolutely loved it so I bought some today while I am working at my computer. Half way through eating the fried rice I munch on something weird... there were chunks of egg shells mixed in the rice. I had to look through the rest of the rice to see if there were more. I am really disappointed because out of all the Thai places that have pineapple fried rice in sacramento, this one was my favorite.< /Review></record>

I placed my order online via their  website.

I ordered salad rolls, drunken noodles with no onions and add shrimp for three dollars more.and a side of Peanut sauce for three dollars.

I get to the restaurant and there were two people in front of me both with mixed up orders.

Not a great impression.

I get home and there are onions in my food, only two shrimp that I paid three dollars for.

They put the warm peanut sauce in with the cold salad rolls.

After picking out all the onions I do have to say the food was good.

But I doubt I will be giving them a second chance.</review>

Changs Thai is the bomb! I totally understand why it got so many 5 stars. The food is super super delicious. I tried their red curry and pad Thai and they totally rock! And the good service was a big plus!<//text>

<Text>I was ceaving for real authentic Thai food, which I haven't had for the last ten years due to being in South Korea and Japan. Because of COVID-19, no dine-in was offered, but you can order to go and eat on the outide terrace area. The food was good, especially the Pad Thai.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlNy1w-fY3cNzhdF43gRzxT200m8WeNo6S8c7G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMITIhv0dKE-p1g88n_-yhNXpOnWZfmYtbmf9KD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJya234BZCBw8TPHxU0fs6eOC0ejuzHdyEqMQv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPvmui4u6swS9mIaOjSS5UuwYEsJU_vJ2ise6u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO627zaFkzrCqixCK5MVJ5qgt0cBseMxJVdb1b-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9qjJJ2TFySLsJ6zK6-gXAODixZlDYU7dGnBmb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPApaAE4rcfxSyqbmIL_jYrQYrXWxKOVvAAQbHr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUjJCphTwagxbCUiiRNYy7RWHYrIPA5aqoyYsg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrk-IFrvph5L-UapuPyYAJ3N05Rej8qxHLFtMk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

The food was actually pretty good aside from the fact that the order of sticky rice I got was literally so hard it was uneatable. I let the lady know and she still charged me for it. Also the service was not great they didn’t come check on us one time.<//text>

This restaurant and the people who own / operate it are truly amazing, sincere, and hospitable. I came in kind of late on a rainy night 20 minutes before they were closing, but they took care of me and told me not to rush—it was so warm.

I ordered pad thai and pot stickers (which were some of the best in the country) and I’ve traveled through Thailand so I know authentic Thai cuisine.

But, it doesn’t stop there. After the meal, I left the restaurant and stood outside under their roof to wait for my Lyft. A lady (I think the owner) came outside and asked me to come stand inside because it was raining. I don’t remember such warmth in hospitality and the restaurant business in my entire life. These are a special group of people and I truly wish them the best in their lives and business.< /Review>

Tasty food. But the quantity of meat given with the dish is small. Other than that lunch is reasonably priced and service is excellent. The owner herself comes out to find out if the food was good or not. I tried the panang curry and pad Thai. You can try them with your choice of meat (beef, chichen or shrimp) or you can just order veggie. They have a stamp card where they give you 1 free dinner or lunch if you dine 8 or 9 times.<//review>

<date>1577953611290<//date><text>Pineapple rice was burnt,  Pad Thai was  soupy and the portion is small, this was a huge turn off for me personally.  The yellow curry was mostly watered down coconut milk unfortunately.  The customer service is very much lacking. We had to get the attention of the server sitting down at a table with their back to us just to get our drinks. This is a place I will not visit again. Tables are dirty and not wiped down well.< /text>< user_id>

The place was cold and drafty and sat far from the door.
But the food was good. With so many choices in the area I wont go back.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Excellent green curry with eggplant and good service.

Super nice lady at the counter.  I was in a huge rush and not able to wait the expected 15 minutes for my take-out. The lady taking my order arranged with the cook to have it done in less time and I only had to wait 5 minutes.  Kudos for the excellent customer service!< /text>

When ever I missed Thai food or being lazy to make one, I order from them. It's halal. The lady , I think her name is Jen is very friendly. The food was good. I got complimentary appetizer on Mother's day. My family favorite are Pad Thai, and beef fried rice. I also love their fish cake.< /Text>

The food was great, the wait was short, and the service was excellent! While at the restaurant, I learned that the woman helping my wife and I was also the owner of the establishment. After placing our order, we chatted for a bit and learned that she had previously managed a local Thai restaurant for several years before going out to open her own restaurant. You could tell how hard the she works and how passionate she is about running her business. We will absolutely be back to support this local businesswoman the next time we're in the mood for Thai!</Review>

Came in for the lunch special and had the yellow curry and thai fried rice. Really good! I like that they bring out the spices so you can make your dish as spicey as you like. The family that runs it is very nice too, we didn't realize they were closing for their afternoon break but they still sat us.</Text>

The food was good but the prices are high and portions small. They yellow curry was ok except for the burned pieces from the bottom of the pot were transferred to the take out container. I will stick with Thai Spoon.< /text>

Food is excellent and my fave place to order from when in Sacramento. However, the same dishes are different each time... A sign of fresh ingredients I guess but having twice ordered the same level of heat in pineapple fried rice this week (hot), and the first time it being on fire, (wonderful) the second not spicy at all, not in the slightest (both tasty), and the thickess of the parang curry also being different in both occasions, a little more consistency would be be great!
Fried tofu starter is perfect tho a little confusing on how many pieces per order.
These comments relate to orders sent through DoorDash and not placed in person.</review>

Chicken Satay is good. Pad Thai is ok, tasted like sweet and sour instead of sweet and spicy. Pad Se Ew is dry, beef was way overcook. Yum Woon Sen Ground is okay.  May go back to try their Curry next time.< /Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>My husband and I came in tonight based on the 4.5 star rating, and we will not be back.  Customer service was non-existent, and the food was subpar. When we walked in, we were greeted only with a stare, and only after we said hi she asked if it was for there or to-go.  Shortly after we ordered our food, a big group came in and sat.  Somehow, they had their food before we did even though it was only the two of us and we ordered first.  We ordered the chicken satay for an appetizer, but it came out at the same time as my pad thai.  My husband's mixed seafood pad se ew came out later.  The pad thai was entirely too sweet, and missing the tang of the tamarind.  We were only checked on once during our meal, and none of the dirty dishes were cleared.  No one ever asked if we wanted refills on our water or drinks.  When we were done with our food, we sat there for almost 15 minutes to which again, no one came to clear dishes, ask if we wanted boxes, or bring the check.  I had to go to the counter to ask for two boxes.  I thought at that point they would see we were ready for the check, but again we sat and waited but the check didn't come.  The server passed us by several times without a glance (she also never smiled once).  We finally flagged her down and asked if we should just go to the front to pay or if they would bring a check and she just said it didn't matter, so we went to the front to pay, and left.

Also, my husband has a steel stomach especially when it comes to seafood, but I will just say his stomach was not happy and he had to use the restroom immediately upon arriving home.  Definitely cannot recommend this place to anyone.<//Text><username>Kimberly Higgins<//username><userid>109624054769723663845< /userid><Gmap_id>0x809ad64976700001:0x8848a2caf0286e10<//Gmap_id>< date>

Excellent and amicable Staff.
Leslie was very helpful and knowledgeable. Leslie went over dental as well as financial information.
I surely recommend this place to get dental treatments. They are professional and ask how you feel at all times. They ensure you are comfortable while doing dental, often an unpleasant need.
They have several financial plans to offer and they walk you through to avoid any difficulty.< /review>

Bye bye Anxiety! Hilda never fails to make you feel so comfortable. She always has a way to relax you and coach you through the entire process; in my case whether it was deep cleaning or getting impressions. She is patient and let’s you stop her at any time of the visit. She is very well educated and knows what she is doing. She thoroughly explains what is going on and what needs to be done in order to reach a healthy smile. I only schedule with her, my husband only schedules with her; she is simply the best and an asset to the company. Thank you Hilda for always being so accommodating. You are a gem!</text>

Hilda did an amazing job with my dental cleaning today. She did not rush during the process and made sure I was comfortable and not feeling any pain while she was cleaning. She was also very helpful in answering the questions that I had with regard to my dental hygiene. She is wonderful and patient, as well as the rest of the staff that I have met thus far.< /text>

<Text>Let me start off this review by saying, I have lived in many states and I have been to many dentists. The vista Western Dental team is one of the friendliest and most helpful teams I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting! Everyone at this specific Western dental cares. The receptionists will remember you name and everyone will treat you with dignity no matter what. The doctor and Frances helped me yesterday, and when I came back for a cleaning today they checked in with me again. Hilda C did my cleaning today with a steady hand, but she was also gentle with me and did an amazing job. Thank you again to the whole staff for giving me such a wonderful experience.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc775bfa21299b:0xbf46321f214ae5fb< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I have visited this site twice so far within a month of each other. Both of my appointments have been early in the morning and I have waited on average 25-30 minutes to be seen. I did not mind the waiting period the first time as I was seeing the orthodontist and this can be a lengthy procedure, however the waiting time for what was meant to be just a cleaning was ridiculous. This last visit i was not seen until 25 minutes after my 9AM appointment, the dental assistant spent over 45 minutes on x-rays alone. I have never had any x-rays take this long especially for a general cleaning. I had expressed when making the appointment that I needed to be done by 11AM due to my work schedule. X-rays were not done until 10:30 and i was told i needed to wait until dentist was done for an exam and THEN my cleaning. In the end all i was able to get done were the x-rays. I have NEVER had to wait almost 2 hours for a simple cleaning that in the end NEVER happened. I was told that my next visit would be 2-3 hours due to them having to combine the exam and cleaning as well as the bonding for my process. The only reason I made the appointment for a cleaning at this facility was because I was told other dentists are iffy about taking brace wires off if they were installed somewhere else. The waiting time is awful but they do keep a pretty clean facility. Do not come here if you are under a time constraint.</Review>< time>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Everyone is very nice and respectful. The waiting time  is a bit long, so sometimes it defeats the purpose of scheduling a specific time. Yet, you can understand why the wait once you are called to the back. Most of the time they are busy and the work is never rushed, therefore you get quality work. I really recommend this location. I was very scared and embarrassed going to the dentist at first due to past experiences, but everyone is very professional.< /Text>< Pictures>

The assistant Jeremiah was very nice and quick but paitent. Letting me know how many x-rays were left. He always asked me if I was ok and comfortable. The mouthwash before sitting down was a nice touch, and I was in and out less than an hour. Amazing service, very nice doctor and staff!< /Review>

Everytime I visit this location I have a great experience. The ladies in the office are friendly and willing to help.  My last visit Hilda C. did an amazing job on cleaning my teeth, making sure I was comfortable, and well informed as she cleaned my teeth. This is by far one of the best dental offices.<//text>

Jeremy is great!! I have a hard time doing mouth X-rays and he was very kind and patient with me!! I get anxiety when I visit the dentist and he kept telling me to relax and breathe, he waited patiently until I composed myself to continue with the X-rays. Jeremy has a great attitude and is very personable!!</Review>

<text>The exam itself seemed to be rushed but The reason I could say it was awesome was due to Jeremiah being so friendly and gentle when giving x-rays.

<text>During my latest dental visit, I was attended by Hilda C. Great hygienist. Very detail-oriented and friendly. It was a pleasure to be treated by her. he gives great advice about cleaning techniques along with videos to watch. I would highly recommend her. The dentist is very elaborate with his X-ray pictures and diagnostics. It is assuring to know that the dentist is very extensive with his work. I highly recommend this office, the only downside is the waiting time, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.< /text><resp>{'time': 1583516539241, 'text': 'Gabriela, we are happy to hear your experience was to your expectations.

<Text>Very bad reception is I would never recommend this place to anyone. We visited the office on North Santa Fe. We filled out a questionnaire that was not in regards to covid. My boyfriend has a cracked tooth with extreme pain, and as patients we were turned away from this office. We spoke with the receptionist to ask her is this in regards to covid - we were in communication asking for help to fill out the papers as any normal person would do! This ofc has no consideration for their patients. A cracked tooth should not be turned away and honestly it's just like what can the hospital do. If anybody's reading this review I would like you to know that I did not feel comfortable as a patient and I would never recommend anyone to this location.<//Text>< Pictures>

I have been putting off  my cleaning and rescheduled twice because I was petrified thinking it was going to be painful. I was so wrong and psyched myself out for no reason. Hilda did my cleaning and she was so amazing! I told her my fear of the numbing process before the cleaning and she told me to wiggle my toes as she numbs me and to my surprise that technique worked amazingly for me. I didn’t feel anything at all! I love how my teeth looked after the cleaning and I feel confident in my smile. The staff are also very friendly and helpful. Frances is awesome! She always has great energy and positive attitude every time I see her. Betzy is amazing with my appointment scheduling, she even calls me a couple days before to remind me I have an appointment. Carol has been so helpful with providing me with info about in-house financing and is great with exploring all possible options. I really love it here and I highly recommend their services!!!!!</review>

I had a double route canal done in about 3 hours and never once did i feel any pain or discomfort after the numbing, after going home, or after waking up the next day! The doctor and his assistant are amazing st what they do and I recommend them to anybody who needs work done!< /Review>

<review>Took my children in because they need alot of work done. All I can say is the office staff at the front desk are so kind and always welcoming with a smile! And the dentist work very hard and are kind as well. I definitely recommend the Western Dental in Vista!! I thank them for the kindness they show to everyone who walked in through the door!<//review>< response>

<text>If I could give a lower score, I would. They over charge, are disrespectful of ones time, and unwelcoming. I waited an hour and a half to be seen by the dental hygienist and and hour forty-five to see the dentist. To make things worse, when they did stop by they stayed for not more than ten minutes. I wasn’t explained much of anything other than how expensive it was going to be to fix my issues (upwards of 4000$.)

I’ve since seen another dental group to which I was met with the hygienist, dentist, office assistant and had a cleaning in UNDER an hour. They then confirmed with me that all I needed was a cleaning and a lecture to floss. I left that dental group for under 100$ without insurance and in half the time spent at Western Dental.

The only plus nice thing about Western Dental was that the X-ray technician was nice. But literally the worst place.<//text>< gmap_id>

Staff is unbelievably AMAZING! From front office to back office. Outstanding. Very clean, professional and the Office Manager is awesome! Good job everyone. You guys are one heck of a team!

Frances is such an amazing dental assistant. Carol in the front office is amazing. Betzy is outstanding and always so welcoming, Dr. Avinash is the most kind Dentist ever and takes his time for his patients. Makes sure you are feeling comfortable and happy. From back to front office and front to back office. Just WOW! I know more staff but don’t remember their names. These people need to be acknowledged. They are INCREDIBLE!<//Text>

Went in for a root canal today pretty terrified from a previous experience at another office, but the dr and dental assistant were amazing! Explained everything that was going to happen and made sure I was comfortable the entire time. They offered me breaks. They also took their time and were very gentle and listened to my concerns. Definitely recommend joerie and the dr I used. Amazing staff!!</Text>

This office is ok if you aren't in a hurry and you aren't in pain. When the patient is experiencing pain the staff just dosen't have any sense of urgency.  I don't recommend this office.</Review>

After giving them a doctors note that was so hard to get I got my treatment they are nice as the dental work they do is expensive but they let you make payments on your dental work. The hygienist Hilds was awesome she did a great job and was gentle with me.</Text>

I’m not the best dental patient in the world LOL. The Western Dental office on Santa Fe are very nice and very thorough with treatments and explanations. They were also very patient with my daughter who has Asperger’s and is very sensitive to noise. They’re the best.< /text>

The staff was really great and throuroughly explained the process of the dental care I require. I am beyond impressed with how my dental appointment went. I was able to get a clear and detailed breakdown of the total cost with my insurance prior to starting the procedures. Overall a great dental practice.< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Yecenia was nice and friendly. Made it easy and comfortable especially the xrays. Thea was awesome and patient with me and my daughter who tagged along during my exams and crown procedure. Can’t remember the gentleman’s name but he was gentle and pleasant.  Betzy was very accommodating and helpful in findings ways to resolve my issue (broken tooth) and especially working around my financially situation. She was always checking if my daughter was okay. Dr. Patish was 👍🏼my savior today and very patient with me. Couldn’t glue back a broken tooth but found way to fix the problem and found time to help me out. I am a new patient and I would definitely recommend this Vista office and kudos to the warm staff.<//text>< pics>

I can't say enough positive things about Joerie.  He is so kind and warm and makes me feel calm.  I had to have 8 teeth extracted and was so scared and more so brought on by severe panic and anxiety disorder.  He kept reassuring me everything would be okay like he has always done for my other visits.

Jacqueln has also been a tremendous help to me throughout everything since my first visit.  She has listened to me cry and talk about my whole life like we've known each other our whole lives.  She's a definite keeper!!

I would also like to recognize Dr. Berry, Dr. Avinash, Jose, Francis, Andrew, and everyone who helped me through this day and I know my upcoming visits as well.

I've never experienced a nicer group of people in a dental office.  This is a new office and it appears business is booming for them.  I hope that each and every employee realizes how much they impact each patient and that their kindness is incredibly appreciated and will never be forgotten.

Thank you so much for your kindness and patience today!< /review>

<Text>Thank you Frances, your great Root canal done by dr.Avinash and joerie it went smooth and painless! So thankful!
I couldnt figure out how to leave a 2nd review but to add to this one I just wanted to say I've had many additional appointments at the vista location and am nothing but grateful for joerie's eagerness to help and accommodate all my dental needs! He goes above and beyond to do whatever is needed and that i have found is rare in this industry but is SO much appreciated. The entire staff doctor avinash,frances,and betsy have helped me so much with every aspect of my treatment and I have nothing but positive things to say about this location of western dental. Thanks guys!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Waste of time! Place is a joke. It takes them over a week to verify insurance? Even though they are contracted with MetLife. You wait till I walk in to tell me you don’t take my insurance?!   Poor customer service and unprofessional. Guess I expected too much from Western Dental, they do live up to their reputation.<//review>

<Text>Mala experiencia la cita era a las 3 pm una limpieza  y estuvo 2 horas en la silla y no le hicieron nada y todavía me dicen que va a esperar más tiempo que porque tienen muchos pacientes. Entonces para que hacen citas si no van haber médicos.  Si hubiera cero en calificación eso les diera.< /Text>< Rating>
