I have been getting my nails done by Lisa since she was at Lady Bug. Her work is clean, the nails last forever & there are sooo many colors to chose from. Love her work!</text>

< Review>
My manicure didn’t come with a little massage or lotion so I walked out with super ashy hands, my cuticles weren’t cleaned and had skin that needed to be nipped, the French tip was very uneven, not straight and only looks good from a distance. Very disappointed.< /Review>

<review>I was not greeted properly. I had an appointment and waited 15 min. I got the Hawaiian pedicure $35+gel polish $13 lasted less than 10 mins. When she was finished I notice my feet was dry she did not scrub them. She said extra $5. She was rough I ended up with a burn when I got home. I still paid $53+$2 I let her keep the change I just wanted to get out of there. I did not want a manicure after that. Horrible!! I will report this place!!!<//review>< Pictures>

I am always very pleased when visiting this shop. It took me at least 3 nail shop fails before finding this one. The service here is so very nice and friendly Lisa is great she takes her time and makes sure everything is the way you wanted making sure YOU are satisfied. This is huge to me since I’ve been to shops that’ll give you what they want instead of what You want. The pedicures are so relaxing Julie takes her time with the scrubbing, the massage, the wax feels so good and your feet are actually soft at the end. It was hard to share this cause they are so great! I love this shop 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰</Text>

<Text>Lisa was very sweet and did a wonderful job. I called early to see if she could fit me in her schedule but she was all booked. So she asked for my number and offered to call me back if someone canceled. 30 minutes later she called me and I was sitting in her salon 20 minutes later. She did a beautiful job in under an hour. Thanks Lisa!</Text><Name>HARRY IS GLITTERy<//Name><date>1559068345867< /date>< GmapID>

Prior to walking into this location I went to My Nail and Spa and it was the worst experience ever. The lady was rude and made my nails look like fresh out of beauty school thick super thick and uneven🤔. I was mad and sad and wanted to go off but my kids were with me and there friends. I drove by The New Lisa's Nails and OMGGGG AMAZING!!! The customer service was top I felt important to them. They offered me water and coffee as well as snacks. They hooked me up fat. Did my nails exactly what I wanted and made my hands look beautiful and the price was better than the last place. I also got my lip and eyebrows waxed and my eyebrows look amazing they look how they suppose to look because before they were uneven too. Thank you Lisa's nail you are so talented amazing and a total sweetheart as well as your brother. Thank you. I COMPLETELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE!!</Text>< pics>

promised expensive milk tea not Good.. don't waste your money.

I ordered 5 milk tea in online.
I don't see my Points reward.
And the girl she said I need go long line in register/cashiers  just to get my points.  But  the line  was  taking to long and Slow Doesn't make sense. That's why I'm ordering online because  we don't like waiting to much.  Good job magagement. For being Genius and Smart.

<Text>I’ve been here for teas and like like their setup of measuring ice and sweetness for their drinks. They also have a nice verity of add-ins. This time I got the calamari and let me say, this was one of the best orders of calamari. These were larger than most places and they were tender not chewy and the breading was good not too bready.<//Text>< name>

< Review>
overall, the milk tea was pretty good, but employee service was terrible. we had to wait a few minutes for the front cashier to take our order when we were clearly ready. on top of that, they were very consistent in asking us to put our masks over our nose, even tho they were over our mouth; my pregnant sister was even told to put it over her nose, as WELL as her four-year-old son. one employee after another telling us what to do, or their despicable "no mask, no service" policy would take place. they wouldn't even acknowledge our exemption card. very disappointing.<//Review>

The wait time was 17 minutes. That is ridiculous! The boba was not even that good. I asked for taro black boba and I got some kind of white jelly. They rudely asked me if I had a mask when I went to get my drink from my sister. They had so many options and variety. The boba is way too overpriced. It was $6!! That is way too much for a large drink with mango and basil seeds. I also like the earl grey, mango, rose tea. This is the worst boba shop ever.< /review>

<Review>Was not even that busy and we still waited super long just until someone took our order. Boba tea itself is alright, not worth the price. Too focused on mask over nose and not enough on getting the order of customers correct and in a timely manner. But employees touching face and mask with hands and then touching drinks. I don't care about all the covid precautions that places take if they forgot the basic hand washing rule before covid.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<review>Girl behind counter has gets pretty aggressive with customers who do not wear mask over their noise.  They refused service to family in front of me.  Used this place few times and after 2nd time they went after customer I said forget it I will use different Boba place.< /review><user>103873814290461014478< /user>< name>

Always gets my order wrong some how every time I go there. The milkshake always have ice chunks from probably not blending it long enough. Drink is always mediocre at best. I'm new to the area and T4 where I was from was actually good but this one needs more work.< /Review>

The most careless delivery ever. They put ice in a cup with a label 0% ICE!!! And basil chicken popcorn definitely have been heated in microwave, there are drops of water on a package and a chicken is soft. Do not recommend!< /Text>

T4. Tea 4 U was a pleasant surprise! Friends and I popped in after having dinner at a neighboring restaurant.  We each picked something different; most had boba drinks. Each of us were happy with our drinks!!! I had a simple jasmine green tea, and I have to admit it was the BEST jasmine green tea I've ever had! The people working were so nice! I recommend giving T4 a try!!!< /review>

My daughter dropped her tea right outside the door and I went in to buy her a new one. I feel like they should have offered me an extra stamp on the buy-however-many-get-one-free cards for the trouble or at least expressed condolences over the lost tea. Lol!

But instead they seemed annoyed and actually shorted me a stamp! I paid for 3 teas but only got 2 stamps and one of them we didn't even get to try.

Its really disappointing to drop your food/drink and not even get to try it. I've been places where they replaced it on the house. I don't expect places to do that because its totally not their fault but to treat a paying customer like its also not your problem makes me kinda wanna not make it their problem by not coming back. It really seems like they don't care about my business or the fact that I immediately walked back in and purchased at full price a whole new tea.< /text><username>Sara Crocker</username>< user>

The food is not very good but the boba and smoothies are decent. The popcorn chicken (despite being made fresh) was rubbery and soft, if I didn't know any better I would compare the texture to that of raw chicken. I'm sure it has something to do with it being dark meat, but it was also slimy inside? Not really sure how else to describe it, perhaps due to the texture of the meat and grease from the oil. All in all not pleasant. The egg rolls were not vegetarian and the sweet and sour sauce had chili and garlic (I'm allergic to garlic) so that was a waste also. If you are looking for a quick local boba, this is fine. If you are hungry do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

11/22- Update, this place just lost the few stars it previously had because I drove all the way from roseville and they decided to be closed 20mins early and turned away myself and two other groups of people. I'll take my business to The Bomb in roseville then!< /text>

<Review>I’ve been to this establishment many times but over the past year my experience has gotten worse the workers are rude . The drink can be expensive just for three large drinks is over 25 $ the “passion fruit milkshake” was horrible I had seeds the whole time in my drink and they didn’t even add milk or ice cream for the milkshake part the novas were unpleasant in all my friends drinks too I’m very disappointed in this establishment ! I would give zero stars if I could<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This is a great place to try different teas with adding different kinds of creams, jellies, and fruits. This establishment has a very clean hip atmosphere. I absolutely love love love the drinks. My personal favorite is Mango Royal Tea with Salted Cheese Cream. The customer service is excellent. The restroom is very clean. This is a definite must try over and over. I come here at least 3 times a week and each time I try a different tea. I would definitely recommend this establishment to all my friends and family.< /Text>

Good service and drinks made to order, as expected. Good variety of drinks at this location. I got the Kyoto green tea latte, which is basically a matcha milk tea, but with richer flavor. It's great!< /review>

I was turned away because I didn’t have a mask. I have a medical condition and you guys didn’t care even though I was 6 ft away from everyone.  And that’s after standing in a long line, heavily pregnant. Not coming here ever and not recommending you to anyone. How rude!</Text>

<Name>Richard Henriquez</Name><text>I went to study with my friends and I ended up getting the passion fruit smoothie and some fries. I love smoothies when they are made with real fruit. These were clearly not made with fruit. They are made with syrup and ice which is a little sad considering the price but the taste was good so it's not so bad. The fries were really good and hot. If I could change a few things about this place it would be that the place was super cold and I couldn't stop shivering and they had some really loud rock music playing when most people that I saw there were playing board games and my group was studying so maybe not the best choice of music for the environment.< /text></record>

I really do love their drinks they make them right. The only issue is who I believe is the owner (a short dark man with an accent), I've had issues ordering with him on more than one occasion due to interrupting customers while ordering and not listening to your order.<//text>

<Text>Showed up at 9:30 even though the updated hours posted at the door said they closed at 10 (it’s a Saturday ) The girl just said “well our open sign is off so we’re closed, besides we have updated our store hours “ then points at a piece of paper taped by the counter. if you turn away customers make sure you do it in a way that makes sense.

Would be zero stars if I could give zero. I just watched an employee drop a container of sauce on the floor, pick it up, wipe it off, and place it on my partially opened food box. Totally unsanitary.</text>

I come here once in a while. When my schedule allows me. I love the boba selections. And being able to not have lots of sugar in it., but the other day I was trying to call to place an order.. waited on hold for about 5 minutes got hung up on. Called a few more times they didn’t answer, just hung up the phone. Then I called again waited About 4 to 5 minutes. On hold. I finally gave up. They told me they were getting lots of calls.  But don’t hang up on them. I do understand it’s a little crazy now with the Covid  19 stuff. Otherwise I would give more stars. There a quite a few more boba places piping up. Maybe I should check some of those places too. I might not get hung up on. I’ll try them I a month or so again.</text>

I really like that they have so many options, they have never been "out" of anything, and they ASK how much ice & sugar to add. Very customizable & I love it!< /Review>

I love tea 4 u , they have an amazing array of drinks here and can pretty much edit any drink that you want to. Also they have lots of like they give you stamps when you go there and sign up with your free upgrade sometimes or a free drink depending on how many stamps that you have.<//Review>

<Text>I enjoy the drink selections. Their range of drinks can definitely keep you coming back to try out different flavors while also having the standard favorites you'll find at any boba shop.

It's close to the community college so you'll always find people there. Though, the area is a bit sketchy.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I am beyond happy to know that there is a good boba tea place in this area now. The service is always fantastic, the options are endless and my favorite part you know it's good because it's always busy. I highly recommend going and the price is reasonable.<//text>

Service here is none. I come in here often because I love the boba but I always feel like a nuisance to the cashiers. I don't need to be treated like a queen but don't make me feel bad for ordering heckin boba. T is not 4 u if service is not 4 u.< /Review>

Why do people not go here? It is relatively quiet, even during the weekends. The boba/tea is amazing! There are so many options to choose from. The tea is high quality. However, some snack options have prices on the high side.</Review>

I absolutely love this place!!! 💗💗💗💗😍😍😊. The staff here are always so friendly, kind and are so quick with the orders. The food is very tasty, the drinks are perfect and always quick to grab. They often have music playing. They even offer outlets for you to charge your phones, tablets and computers. So glad they opened up next to the college. We boba is so good and this place is a great meetup spot for a group project, quick snack break, relaxed date spot or even a people watching afternoon. They even provide games for you to play. Please stop by this place and enjoy everything they have to offer!!<//text>

A smaller version of the other t4's. Customer service is always great. The snacks are delicious and the tea is tasty. The boba pearls are a bit softer and lighter in flavor than some other places I've been to but still good. I love the choices of music they play and there are fun little games like Uno and Battleship to play so you can hang out, sip, nibble, and have fun! Check em out!<//text>

T4 is a great place to hang out with friends. I love how they have games. Reallly innovative. One thing I advise on though....get new uno cards. The ones there are a little....let me say it kindly...overused.(: Anyway, good little place to go to! I hope to visit again!</review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
drink is good, food takes too long to come out, and they are so expensive, i bought 1 drink 2 sides and paid $20. and waited 30 mins for my food, by the time the last item arrived the 1st one was cold. and they charge 50c for each dip even though the foods you get usually get dipped. Wings and calamari usually come with it... not this place. 50c each dip.</review>

Came here on a Sunday afternoon to work on my laptops. It’s prolly the only spacious coffee/dessert shop that opens for dine-in, with wifi and with a plug-in port for your electronic devices. Definitely coming back here to work. Their drink is pretty good. Gonna try other items next time.<//text>

I originally wanted to take my mom over to somi somi yesterday but it was packed like crazy. Luckily, I was able to find this shop! Not only did they have similar desserts like somi somi, they have unique flavors that are alot more traditional! IE, one of the very few places you can try out durian!

I had the midnight munchies so I decided to order wings from them as well, it was blazing hot since it was made so fresh and they had different flavors to enhance the taste!

So whether you come here for the cute cashiers or the ambiance, this place would make it a fantastic night out!< /Review>

They just started serving their chicken sandwiches so I had to try it. I'm usually not good with spice, but I got their medium spicy and it was the perfect amount!! I also got the fries, both cajun and regular to share with my friend. The next time I go, I'm definitely going to opt for the cajun fries, the regular fries were a bit too plain for my liking.<//Review>

Cool place casual place to hang out with friends and enjoy some ice cream, selection of drinks (non alcoholic) and a small selection of food. Would definitely return here to hang out. Went there for some ice cream and thoroughly enjoyed it.<//Review>

Compared to other ice cream, this one isn't overwhelming too sweet. The matcha with Nutella filling is AMAZING<//Text>

<user_id>103120462086472670840</user_id><review>I really like the atmosphere here. Fun relaxing place to enjoy dessert. I liked the Durian and Taro delight with fish waffle. Waffle remained soft and not hard due to coldness of ice cream. Boba is yummy, cant go wrong. Excellent customer service.

<text>I’ve always had a good experience here. Their taiyakis are absolutely amazing. It’s crispy on the outside but still has a nice chew to it. The taro ice cream I typically get with it tastes so light yet creamy. The customer service is always great too. This place is way better than the overrated Somisomi<//text></record>

<text>Gone too soon....my ice cream cone was. I have no shame in saying I'm a typical fat kid when it comes to desserts but when you sample the specialty ice cream cones and other treats you'll be crying too. The place has great drinks, plenty of room for lounging and studying and a streamlined menu that also includes some fried chicken treats. Pop in or stay a while you will love it. Take your time ordering but if you grab a cone, get the nutella filling at the bottom.</text>< pics>

The owners here are very thoughtful.  Had an issue with the tayaki maker and while waiting they offer me a drink on the house.  I've been going here a lot and today was just one of the reason I revisit.<//Review>

Love this place. There are so many creative ice cream flavors. Great for the gram. Ask about those that are not on the menu. It's a great spot to hang out and create memories.</Text>

<text>Friendly staff, delicious soft serve! The Taiyaki includes one flavor of soft serve (samples are available), one filling, and two free toppings! The waffle is delicious, soft but also crisp.

<Text>The durian ice cream was awesome. Creamy and duriany but not the fake durian type.

The taiyaki was amazing! Crispy exterior and soft inside. A really perfect balance with the ice cream.

Highly recommend!< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYlegZ4FdnkjiwUEZPL_o-bgeBcJfb2fmqOxw8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Review>Their main star is their Taiyaki-cone ice cream. It's definitely a second wave business that took the dish from a popular chain in Irvine. We got the ube ice cream with red bean filling. It was okay, the service was great and there's plenty of seating. The ice cream is definitely way more sweet. We enjoyed the ice cream more than the filling in the cone.<//Review>< pictures>

This is a cute little dessert place for those who tend to have a sweet tooth.
I met the owner shortly after they had their soft opening and she was very friendly and caring. It was evident that she prioritized quality over quantity (i.e. the drinks are always made from fresh ingredients). The menu items are also reasonably priced, especially for those who are ballin on a budget... (#me)
This place also has a decent amount of space to play games, study, hang out, or read.
I've been here a few times and the atmosphere is always very relaxed.
Overall, it's worth a try!</Text>

< review>
We love this bakery so much.They have the popular sponge cake and also a very savory not too sweet tres leches cake.
The bakery is owned by a very hardworking couple who are very nice and they are always willing to accommodate clients even with same day orders (within 2 hours for sponge cakes). We tried this bakery by recommendations of a few family friends who live in the AV area, and I am very glad we did 🙌</review>

The cake is so melting in your mouth that you finish the whole cake without noticing it that you are done eating...
I strongly recommend this bakery!<//text>

This bakery has been a family favorite for years.  They began their business in the San Fernando Valley many years ago. They have been in the Antelope Valley now for at least 20 years. The style, taste and service is amazing, worth every cent. Just today I called 5 minutes before closing time as I parked the car, the clerk gladly waited to take my order. They take cash, credit and debit ( they do charge a debit processing fee).</review>

This ma and pop shop is the only bakery that can fulfill my sweet tooth. I had a strawberry filled cake for my anniversary back on the 21st of March and man this cake blew my mind with the freshness of the strawberries and how moist the cake was.< /text>

$40 for the quarter sheet strawberry filled cake. Cake is soft like sponge with whip cream. Not too sweet. Mine had no almonds. I wanted to buy the 12 pecan cookies that were left, but owner didn't let me buy them. He said he had to have enough left to sell to incoming customers, he would sell me 6??? Say what? The butter cookies are really good though.</Review>

We paid almost $40. For a 1/4 sheet that was less than 2" tall and of course they added extra $2. /strawberry, For that much money they should have used decent size cut strawberries, but it was so thinly sliced and of course no toasted almonds avail. we would never go back there again. I rather drive down below to the valley to get my awesome strawberry cakes or settle for a cake at costco.< /Text>

<Review>By far the best cake shop in the A.V. It's an old school mom and pop shop, very simple but yet very DELICIOUS cakes. I recommend the Tres Leches cake to die!!  I mean if you like a cake that's not soaked in milk they make the best one...lol hope my review is helpful< /Review><user_name>Lizzie< /user_name>< Pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The bakery strawberry cakes are really delicious but unfortunately the customer service is horrible the lady who attends is a rude ill-mannered I think if you no longer have patience to serve better, you should hire another person who is more friendly 😡😡😡😡

<review>This shop serves the best chocolate, coffee, espresso, and raspberry concoctions that you will ever indulge in! The atmosphere is pleasant and sprightly. This coffee shop never fails to satisfy and amaze me. After a long day of sightseeing, this is the best place to kick back and talk about your day. We love their coffee so much!<//review><UserId.>103132355120846563139<//UserId.><rate>5</rate>< Resp>

The ice coffee was pretty good. As well as the Vietnamese Sandwich. Service was good. It's your typical Vietnamese Coffee Cafe.<//Review>

We stopped by for coffee and cake and were extremely impressed by their kind staff, great atmosphere, and affordable prices. This is a great place where you could just go to watch the people and read the signs on the wall, or just step out back to an exhibit. The atmosphere is everything here, and the coffee is good.</Text>

A large industrial space where their team of super-talented baristas makes some of the best coffees. There’s a real community vibe here, and that combined with the bright airy space makes it somewhere you’ll probably settle in and have a second cup. Even if you're not a coffee lover, surely, if you could try it, you'll be addictive and you'll be coffee lover then. Must try!</text>

Great scenery here for sure. Awesome bahn mi. Coffee could kill a small donkey so be careful, it's super strong. They also have the standard really bad beer selection of most VN places so you can round out that coffee buzz. Smoking inside is annoying...<//Review>

<text>This coffee shop really has the best coffee that's best for me! Every time I come around here, the staffs are very polite and even greeted me enthusiastically. The coffee was good, and thanks to this barista, who does it very well. For me, this would be the best coffee shop ever. Strongly recommended!<//text>< Pictures>

When I was about to enter, the staff greeted me enthusiastically and it made me more comfortable especially I am new here. They also provided me with books to read while enjoying the heavenly taste of the coffee. I liked the flavor that I chose for it was soothing my mind. I do believe that drinking coffee is one way of calming your soul. If you don't believe me, just try and feel it!< /Review>

<review>Coffee is very mediocre and sandwiches are good( $7-12), but customer service is almost nonexistent. There was only one waitress serving the entire coffee shop yesterday & she was a bit  unhappy/non-responsive. Took 15 mins for someone to come ask for an order.... that's crazy wait time for a coffee shop. Normally u get service as soon as u come through the door.<//review>< date>

Cafe Paradise is Paradise! They have several attractive ladies serving coffee and other beverages especially Vietnamese coffee.

They have a number of large screens dedicated to sports and music and they have an outdoor courtyard that also has big screen TVs.</review>

< review>
Been here a few times with a couple of my buddies but always get treated like 2nd class citizens, as a black my I try not to let race dictate my life but I definitely feel discriminated against when I come here.

For example the last time I came here I ordered my food and drink and l was nice and respectful, saying thank you and please the whole time when I needed anything.

The waitresses looked like they didn't want anything to do with us, ZERO eye contact and did not respond to us saying thank you or anything. We thought ok maybe they're tired today but when we began to pay attention to how they were acting around other tables, they suddenly came alive and were laughing and and smiling. It just felt really strange to be there. Looking back at the few time prior we never received any good service, the coffee and food is not bad but after this last experience me and friends can't support an establishment that treats us like we're not welcomed.<//review>

They do allow smoking inside and distribute hookah, but it's honestly not smoke heavy.

Food here is actually bomb.

Not gonna lie, this is the ideal Viet cafe to visit as your first one.<//review></record>

Avoid this place. RIP OFF! Worst experience ever.. Had been going there for lunch with friends on a weekly basis, know some waitresses to and was bringing new customers - but I'll never ever go there ever again.

Waitress wanted an _extra_ $8 for a lemonade with regular water not bubbly and no lime the last time I went. So of course I took my lemon and left never to return, and now I'm letting the world know what's going on.

She'd said "$8 labor fee", when the menu says $6 total. Last time we were there we left a $25 tip, and always leave a big tip because everyone else just leaves a dollar or two for the waitresses.. Now we all know why.

A friend even bought a lottery ticket there and he won $300, but they never registered the ticket? so he couldn't collect. They burned him, and have some sort of scam going on. He got his winnings from the Lottery but Paradise is most likely under investigation for Lottery fraud now too.

Avoid these thieves at all cost....<//text>

Better than expected, I got the 2 beef flautas and they are bigger than any place I went to for 4.99. Flavor was on point, good portions and toppings too. Tried the birria tacos with consume  for 7.99 and it was yummy and crunchy.</text>

Ordered via Grubhub and picked up our order which didn't take too long! I'm not sure if they offer dine-in right now but they do have a drive-thru and a seating area outside. We ordered the plain chips, birria, quesobirria, adobada combo plate, and a pollo asada wrap (not pictured bc my bf was too hungry and ate before I snapped a pic hahaha).

Their birrias live up to the hype! My bf really liked his wrap especially the chipotle sauce. And I love how well their adobada is seasoned. Definitely glad this place is just nearby so I can satisfy any mexican food cravings 🤤<//review>

<Text>I've been through the drive through twice now. They're a little slow for a drive in, maybe 15 minutes with only three cars in line. The birria is really good and the San Diego Burrito is on point!< /Text>< GmapID>

<review>Clean, Bright spot.  Salsas are great,  orange has a good kick. Fillings were loaded. Tried the enchiladas,  a little light on sauce but good.  Tostadas,  good.  Fish taco and beef taco yumm. Potato taco, unique taste, nice and crunchy shell.  Loved the bean burrito myself.</review><username>Lindsey Tarr</username>< resp>

<Review>The food is amazing! The guys working there are always super nice and friendly. There is lady who wears glasses there sometimes, that is not really friendly but I don't care! The food makes it worth dealing with her.
Try the quesabirria tacos, amazing!!!</Review>< Pics>

I wanted to see the $$ here, before eating here; as I try to get the(ir) online menu first. But that online menu not behave to connect (as there be no signal in any way).
So I call the(ir) phone#, asking to speak to who does the website, to make sure that I am speaking to a correctly intelligent person (no  sic).
Once I ask such question -- to an AGGRESSIVE voice that picked up, there was mis-communication from their end, with this language barrier. As he spoke so fast that I could not understand him.
That was a clue that he just not care to what my reason for call was; I took his answer as telling me to just come over here and look at the menu.
As I just chose to end "I THINK YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT YOU WANT ME TO EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE."

To anyone who has searched at that "menu" online page image:  see that center of the wooden panel; there be the open hole and the knot next to it.  They look like EYES staring down at you. rather dis-respectful.<//review>

Read good review of this place in La Mesa Happenings.  Placed phone order. Lady on phone put me "on hold" and argued with someone in the background.  Ordered carne asada tacos and plain bean burrito (no cheese). Was told to wait 15 minutes to pick up. Got there, waited in car to give them extra time. Then waitrd in drive through lane for about 10 more minutes. Car in front never moved, so decided to park car and walk in to pick up food. Same lady from the phone said she canceled the order because we got off the line, which made no sense since we had ordered over the phone more than 30min before and took less than a minute to park the car and go inside..lady was annoyed for some reason all this time. Lady asked to repeat order, gave lady the order again and, with a pretty bad attitude, told me I had ordered a cheese burrito not a plain burrito, I told her I ordered a plain burrito (no cheese), lady said "no you didn't "... lady yhen looks at order slip and realizes she was wrong. No apology was given, but none was expected. Cook starts to prepare food..Waited for another 15 minutes. Got food, got home, inspected burrito...and guess what...yes got a cheese and bean burrito! This place needs better service. By the way the lady kept lowering her covid mask all the time. Never going back to this place.<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><review>This place is new. I will give them that grace. There are a few things to improve on as they move forward. One, timing of the orders, I don't think people want to wait 10 plus minutes for there food.  Two, accuracy of the orders. The server should not get the orders wrong or assume one dish is to one party and not to the party who actually order it. I made an order of shrimp cocktail and ceviche tostada. And the gentleman gave my order to another party so I had to wait for them to make my dish. Overall it was good. There food is good. But those are the only things to work on and they will be fine.</review>< Pics>

Me and my boyfriend stumbled upon this place while driving. He was hungry and was like lets try that place. Im a taco shop connoisseur, so I was like, NO, im not gonna go to a random tacoshop. He was like all good taco shops start with a P, its good trust. ( I dont know where his logic comes from). So maybe 3 days later. He's like I want Birria tacos. So we were headed to Birria Kings, then he was like lets try that taco shop we saw. Im side eyeing him, and was like i dont remember the name. He was like google maps it. So i did and found the name. We searched the instagram and it looked BOMB. So we went on my lunch we got the surf and turf burrito and 2 birria tacos. When i say it was SOOOOO good. I was mad we didn't go the first time we saw it. We ended up going the next day just for tacos and the Nachos it was just as good. My boyfriend went a third time 2 days later and got the hot cheeto fries....he liked it. He said he is probably better if you eat it there versus traveling to take it home, cause we live like 15min away. All in all though this is our new go to Taco Shop. I can't wait to try more items on the menu. I have already bragged about this place to my friends wnd And they have the 5 Star app so you get rewards for dining there which I love. Try them you wont be disappointed!</review>

< Review>
This is a great Mexican restaurant, with great food, great service, and a great location. Inside is very clean, well-maintained, and the staff are all friendly and welcoming. There's a fresh salsa bar that ranges from mild to aye dios mio! The restaurant is right off El Cajon Blvd with a drive thru, and easy walking access to the neighborhood around. And most importantly, the food is great!< /Review>

The Birria Quesatacos are the best. If you've never tried them you must try them. Think of it as like French dip but for tacos. Their menu has all the regular offerings too. This place has dishes not always found at other taco shops.< /Text>

<Text>Awesome place.
Carne asada is amazingly tasty. I come from further up in North County, but this restaurant hit the spot.

Juicy and tender carne asada isn't as common as it used to be, but these guys deliver it.

Salsa bar is small, but chilled.

Red, green, roasted, habanero and pico/chunky salsa. All good.

So spice aficionados:
Habanero is legit. Has a kick and a slow burn.

Non spice aficionados: Get the green sauce instead. More mild.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSGn8HfLRlqM6zwl77Dn0IZotJkyGEh56j1Qu1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Just found this the other day on the way home from donating plasma. It's just a few blocks from my house and I noticed they had a drive thru and I had to pick up something for my picky 15 year olds daughter, for dinner,  on the way home. So I got the usual bean and cheese burrito for her. Oddly enough she loved it. She likes about 30% of bean and cheese burritos that are purchased for her btw. Also,  I got the rolled tacos with beef and everything on them.  Delicious. We've been back a couple times since and haven't had a bad experience.  Also they are very friendly which is a major plus!

Just like to say that I've never had such faith in a Mexican restaurant serving various items ants myself,  partaking in them! Usually I stick to the same old thing  because I'm afraid to try something new especially when I'm hungry, and that's a big risk! I have gone here several times now and I order something different every single time.  They haven't failed me on taste...Chile relleno, cheese enchilada, chips and guac (simple yet...YUM), fish taco, shrimp burrito, Rolled tacos.. i've had all of them so gar but can't wait to add to the list!< /review>

Food is decent but on more than one occasion it feels like they don't care. This was supposed to be a beef taco</Text>

<date>1555127818634</date><Rating>5< /Rating><text>In this corner, weighting in as the "cleanest" shop on El cajon blvd, I give you the Challenger Penelopes Mexican food.  I the vegetarian found the menu a little typical at first.  The veggie burrito is a bean and cheese with the average topping but damn it was it tasty.  They are so new I saw the health inspector on my way out.  Large lot right across the street from the go lounge and from what I've seen better food than chelatos and open more as well.  I wanna see what there menu looks like after the horde of la Mesa taste buds require.  Customer service on point. My burrito was so fast that by the time I hit up the salsa bar and filled my first cup I got it and bit into it. This yellow sauce what I think is the hottest, nose running, lips aching,  habenero sauce from parks all the way down to college.  I hope the expand the vegetarian menu, I hope they make the hot sauce just a little thicker, I love the idea that I'll never visit the place in front of the blvd.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkwFbalczkUhIQsrI8Yi5StgHUStn3O3NlxxHW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUPMuOhWBX4QQm5gtXQrMzYW_tgJw-I5xS6sbb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80d95736b003edfb:0x80c1cc4cdaf0849d</gmapID></record>

<review>Just had Penelope's for the second time in a month. Really good Mexican without trying be over the top. The Carnitas tacos add a generous scoop of guacamole to the crispy pork. The Chori Pollo tacos are an amazing mix of chorizo and chicken with onions and cilantro tossed in. Top it with their habanero hot sauce and you have spicy perfection.
The rolled tacos, topped with real guacamole and cotija, are solid, too.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

The only thing I've had that I didn't like was the diablo burrito because it was too spicy (and I generally like spicy food). Like imagine if the devil wanted to make a burrito to torture you. That's how hot it was.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Lady was very annoyed at the drive through. Ordered a enchilada and tostada. It was all soggy thrown together. Ordered a burrito with rice no rice just beans only. Then a taco lets talk about that. It looks as if someone took a bite then wrapped it up and threw it in the bag! What a waste of money for such bad service and food.< /Review>

I got rolled tacos, very meaty, cooked just right. Also a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream. Great flavor to the beans, generous with the sour cream. They also offer 3 flavors of hot sauce. Red, green and a habanero .  Both reds deliciously hot. I'll go back</Review>

As someone that grew up in tijuana and still lives in, I gotta give up to this restaurant. My standards on tacos are very high and that's very hard to find in SD. This is place is legit tijuanita. I had their quesabirrias and omg! The size, the cheese, the condiments! Well seasoned, salsa waa amazing as well.
But what made me do this my new mexican spot is how extremely CLEAN is this restaurant. I dont eat at just any kind restaurant because of that, you can see how clean the kitchen is, the bathroom were sparkling clean. HIGHLY recommend this place and they have drive through too. Can't wait to come back and have some more amazing birria.<//Text>

The first time I walked in to this restaurant, I was greeted with a smile and treated great. It's a very welcoming environment and the food is amazing. I grew up on Mexican food and this reminds me of why Mexican food is my favorite. The Carne Asada is always cooked perfect and is very tasty. I've tried a majority of the items on the menu and they've  all met and exceeded my expectations. It's also a great value based on the cost to what you get. I love this place and would highly recommend it to everyone.<//review>

I live in the area and was excited to come try it out. Glad to say I was far from disappointed. Prices are super reasonable and both tacos I tried (pollo and carne soft) were fantastic. Definitely recommend trying this place out.< /review>

Order carne asada fries and a shrimp el diablo, burrito.  The carne fries were average in every way. The burrito was insanely dry and had hardly any shrimp in. I tried the place after reading the positive reviews. Maybe they tried harder when they first opened. I don't think I'd eat here again.</Text>

Food was substandard. Fajitas are supposed to be strips of beef or chicken grilled over an open fire and seasoned served with seared bell peppers. What I got was diced up carne asada burrito meat, decidedly not cooked over an open fire. mixed with nearly raw bell pepper chunks. I also ordered a side of guacamole. What I got was barely guacamole. It was virtually runny and tasteless. Very unimaginative. Taco Bell has better guacamole. The refried beans and rice we're okay, but then again it's really hard screw up refried beans or rice.
I would suggest you go someplace else and spend a few dollars more for Mexican food the tastes better than this<//Text>

The place is so lonely and empty, that it is imposible to think that they have anything fresh I had fish tacos plate and fish was dry and over fried almost burned, you can notice that the cabbage was oxidizing already brownish, same with shrimp taco....and it is a mexican place nothing new more of the same<//review>

<review>I've visited Penelope's 4 times since they opened. I've ordered the carne asada fries, enchiladas suizas, fish taco and the beef tacos combo. Consistently delicious food that's not outrageously priced.</review>< pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) I could be better, the cilantro was no longer useful and the shrimp tacos were not even good seasoned and the shrimp were not breaded.

CUSTOMER SERVICE A+++++++
The ambiance, the drink selections, the prices.... You cannot beat them anywhere else in our Desert Valley. I love how it truly is a place of community where everyone is extremely friendly and the staff made terrific suggestions for our out of town guests. Thank you, thank you, thank you!<//Review>

<review>Stacy’s in Palm Springs is an amazing place. There’s a man playing a piano on Friday nights. He plays the classics.  I love the ambiance. There is a nice chandelier and the music is not too loud. I think it’s the classiest bar in PS. I enjoy their wine and the prices.< /review>< Resp>

This has some very good charm.  Mark's singing old classics give this place a unique old school charm.  My suggestion is not to lose this fab singer/piano player.< /review>

Such a friendly and relaxing bar.  The new owner has made some really nice upgrades (chairs, video screens, etc.) and the piano music was a great pleasure Thursday night.  Attracts a nice crowd of friendly and welcoming patrons.  A unique bar that sets itself apart from the rest on Arenas!<//review>

<review>This is a 5 star place for those like a relaxing time. Live piano music and you still can have conversations.  The staff is excellent.  Happy priced drinks at $3 wells are more than adequate.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-6sKXPbgRb6II2kEsNYW8tR9asA5zKHv3DWOL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>This is a great bar and a wonderful, overdue, addition to the bar scene in Palm Springs. It's a small, intimate space with carpeting, chandeliers, and cool deco-style wallpaper. There is a piano entertainer 5 days a week. Stacy's has lowered their prices and run an all-day happy hour from 10am-8pm.  Nice relaxing atmosphere and can can quite lively around the piano some nights.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Disappointed as  2 weeks ago, same time of the evening, ordered Amaretto Sour $5.00, today,, same drink, same time & weekday as last $11.00 this time.  will not do that again! One draft beer $5.00. No more Stacey's!! So far highest prices on Arenas!! Tried it again 6/14/19, new owners. Ordered drinks happy hour, didnt ask to cash out till later, talking with friends, charged $9.00 for rum & coke happy hour price. Never again!!!!! Not good!!!!!!!!  I'm done!!!!!!! RIDICULOUS!! ANY other bar than here! I totally don't understand the 4 or 5 star reviews. Bad prices, service blah.... I did not ask for topshelp alcohol. Price was just doubled!</Review>
<pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1515703469607, 'text': 'Hi Mark.  I do hope you said something to the bartender that served you.  We do offer well amaretto (a well price) and Amaretto di Saronna (a top shelf price).  I wonder if you got one of each on your 2 visits.  Oh, and we have lowered our prices if that makes any difference.  Maybe if you give us another chance, we can do better.\nStacy'}</Resp>< GmapID>

Pleasant space with friendly bartenders.  I only have two real complaints, both relating to the fact that it's very hard to socialize with friends.   1. The seating inside is at at least 4 different heights....super low sofas, high stools, low stools, medium chairs... all different.  You wind up talking to someone's belly button, or they into your knees.   2. The audio from the pianists (which are quite good, btw) tends to be over amplified - usually  much louder in the front of the bar than right at the piano.   I would suggest more present at the piano where people want to listen 100%  and more background in the front and outside where folks want to be more social.  All that said, it's nice to have a real piano bar back in the neighborhood.< /Text>

The waiter brought out extra sets of drinks I did not order and when I questioned him on this he threatened to kick me out of the bar. This is actually a decent bar just had a bad experience with this particular crazy bartender. This bartender was raging so hard I’m not sure if he is mentally stable, it was hilarious in retrospect.<//Text>< name>

<Review>ATTENTION ANYBODY WITH AN OUT OF STATE ID.

I am from Arizona and am 23 years old. Was going out to celebrate me graduating with my Masters and they did not take my ID, telling me it was photoshopped and the manager was very rude to me and treated me horribly. Obviously the manager can't tell a real ID from a fake, which is a GREAT quality to have at a place like this.

Do not waste your $$$ on this business.<//Review>< user_id>

< Review>
There Taco Tuesday Tasting was amazing last week! $1, $2, $3 Tacos that tasted so good with 8 different types of tacos. The avocado Taco, Buffalo Taco and Fajita taco was my favorite so far. Wish I got to try them all. One of the best Taco Tuesdays in Newport Beach. Sunday Brunch was a great deal. It was a $20 brunch with bottomless mimosas and they had different type with pineapple juice cranberry and I think a sunset one. Heard they have a dj on Friday and Saturday so I was planning on stopping by soon at night to see whats it's like.< /Review>

The worst customer service I have ever seen! I dock my boat and dine there often to support the business and the owner, they towed my GF’s car as we were dining there “on accident” asked me to go and pay 300.00 after running my night and promised to reimburse me next day, I have reached out to them multiple times, ever on the GM’s cell and they just ignore my calls! I’ll never step a foot in that garbage restaurant again!</Text>

The Blonde girl at the bar Tried to rip off my friend by only giving him half of the ginger beer, then she lied that it was empty but then she poured the rest into my cup. Never coming back to this place, also I was very disappointed cause they time they didn’t have the ginger beer with alcohol it was only the soda one.< /text>

<review>Usually a fun place to go out at night. But good luck if you get that short bald dude as your bartender. Dude is a major tool so god bless if you get stuck with him. Maybe it isn’t a coincidence that so many reviews mention the poor service this place regularly displays.< /review>< Pictures>

<rating>5</rating><text>Dinner last night was delicious and made all the more enjoyable by the keyboard offerings of Justin Abrams and female guitar partner.
Broccolini, crab cakes and spicy potatoes from the 'small plates' menu  will have you checking with the chef for the source of the wonderful flavors. If you thought you knew fresh vegetable, get ready to be surprised!
(Worth mentioning this restaurant had "Mr. G's in front of the name but that is gone now and Jared is managing a whole new creation)< /text>< Pics>

I came to the restaurant and I found a delicious hamburger, it was so spectacular that I did not think of any diet, I recommend it 100%.  I would return to this place without a doubt 1000 times more.</text>

Wonderful location, excellent food- I had the chicken and waffles (which is not something I would usually choose) and everyone else at the table was grabbing bites from my plate. They offered bottomless mimosas, with different options for juice which was lovely.<//Review>

<Text>Just sad ... Wished for so much more. Wasn't really busy for a Saturday but our table for 4 couldn't get a second drink. Lunch came - but the drinks never made it back. We drink a lot! Tab should have been $200 more but couldn't spend it.  Shame.</Text>< gmapID>

<Review>This is a place of stark contrasts. On one hand there is an amazing cooking quality and simple but sky high perfect gourmet Italian dishes and beautiful location with dreamy sights, very pleasant polished waiters and nice but slightly unpolished supporting staff. On the other hand poor work flow organization and general subpar management of the front: waiting for a reserved table for 20 minutes although I saw empty tables and claimed no room available upstairs (this didn't seem to check out either), an hour wait between appetizer and the main course, missing silverware or two knifes and no fork, noone cared to adjust the temperature as it was getting very chilly and heaters seemed to be available, no suitable boxes to go, no coffee available🧐, no bread basket🤔 - it is Italian restaurant. Dishes are small (I am actually ok with that for lower calories intake) but mega excellent cooking. Dessert was limited in variety but sky high quality of preparation and taste as well as size (large).
So, I feft dumb struck at the end as the most difficult stuff seemed to be mastered to perfection and the basic stuff was left on the floor.</Review><Date>1582090441332<//Date>< response>

<text>I had a good time.  Service was great.  Mr. G brought me my salad with those house made croutons with sage.  Mmmmgood!  Then I got the demi mushroom burger and fries.  It's so good I'm glad I don't live near the Peninsula or I'd be eating that burger every day and be as big as a house!  Lol. It is that good.  It hits every taste receptor in your mouth.  Save up your appetite because it is HUGE! And juicy.   I needed two napkins just to get through the burger.  It gets all over the place.  😀< /text><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

Today there was a group or family there and when they were ordering their desserts, one BnR person asked for the next order and a lady that works there, Marisa, snapped at them and said, "Only one BnR person per group." She made them all wait for one person to make their orders. By the time it was all done, half of them were already done eating and the others were melted ect. She was very unprofessional to almost everyone that she interacted with. First time I've seen her at this location. I've never had any issues with any of the employees there until today. Seemed as she was bringing down the great customer service and image of this BnR.<//text>

The manager is NOT a people person and was very rushy and short. I have mental processing issues and he ultimately pressured me into deciding quickly and was arguing with another guest while complaining to a co-worker that they  were under staffed and whatever. We got to the car and I ended up just crying and throwing my ice cream away, I didn't like it
I'll never go back, especially when  Brock's ice cream so close.< /Review><user_id>112125731348380283420</user_id>< Date>

Honestly I should probably call the health department, but I feel I have to people know first. I just watched a cockroach 🪳run across the counter. Like over the ice cream counter. The staff just watched it and continued to do thier thing. The only reason I saw it was because a group of children started yelling 🪳🪳🪳🪳🪳🪳🪳🪳🪳 that's bad the whole place is infested clearly.<//Text>

if you order online you don't get all the toppings advertised, in the banana royal comes with nuts whipped cream and a cherry, I ordered 3 on door dash and asked for no nuts on one, they told the dasher those don't even come with nuts! And none of them had whipped cream or cherrys! Seriosuly disappointing< /Review>

It shares its space with Togos' Sandwich, so it's smaller than the usual stores you would find in Los Angeles. The menu is the same, offering the usual BR flavors. This is where I usually get my fill of Rainbow Sherbert (3 scoops in a cup).< /Text>

My daughter kept wanting to touch the window area (where the tables are against ) and it is absolutely gross , the chairs look like they have never been wiped down. The floors are gross. And the female worker was talking extreamly loud about how she hates someone and saying stuff my daughter   Shouldn't have to listen to while trying to enjoy her ice cream or at all. I'm very disappointed<//review>< Pics>

Space has been a really good addition to our routine. My Daughter loves the street dance class, and next semester is trying a contemporary dance class as well. The performances are really well put
Together and the kids are all so excited to be a part of something so amazing. The costumes were great and the teachers are super with the kids. Lila loves her dance classes! We had attended classes when she was younger and then ventured off to ballet, gymnastics, etc, but so glad we came back. Definitely a great place to bring your kid for an extracurricular activity! Boy or girl!</Text>

It’s hard to quantify how wonderful this place is. It’s so rare to have talent, love, selflessness, and professionalism all in one school for the arts for children. And it’s all here!< /Text>

SPACE has Music Together groups, all sorts of movement and dance for kindergarten and up, and even adult singing classes. I am so glad this place is here in Ukiah. It has made a big difference to my children.</Review>

<Review>I used to live Pet Club but I've recently have realized that their prices are higher than other pet stores and they're always short handed. If they lowered their prices they might get more customers. Staff is friendly and helpful though.<//Review>< user_id>

<review>Wanted to pet club to get my dogs vaccinated Sunday, 25 April.  took all my information down by the time we’re ready to go to the back to get it done they denied my 6 month old puppy. Didn’t get his name very rude. I will never step foot in there due to the veterinary VIP club that was there. I Always use them. But when you have bad service Then it spoils everything. I’m sure the pet club is decent but because of the Rudeness of the veterinary staff we will tell all my friends to never go in there to get there pets vaccinated.</review>< UserId.>

<Text>It was an all around decent trip to the Elk Grove "Pet Club", sure didnt feel like I was apart of any club tho to say the least. Due to Not one person spoke to me the entire time I wandered down EVERY single isle in the damn store, straight Lost.... so it took me 5 times longer then I originally anticipated, which then set back my entire night. Sadly Now I'm thinking I should of just hit up one of the big box pet store "Smart Pet or Co Pets" because we all know they bug the dog piss out of ya which would of got me out a lot quicker... idk wouldn't roll through pet club unless you have some time to waste and money sh*t was pricey as hell..<//Text><user>109686177082228644244< /user><gmapID>0x809ac71c8d435e7f:0x7dbedecf8c28712b< /gmapID><name>Kenneth McClure<//name>< Pics>

I was very disappointed to see one employee with her mask down around her neck instead of covering her mouth and nose. And another employee (who appeared to be a lead worker or maybe a manager) with no mask at all. There was also a customer in the store without a mask. I will give this store one more chance but if they cannot follow the appropriate public health requirements I will not return.< /text>

We love pet club at our house. They have anything you really need for ALL your pets! We have dogs, chickens, hamsters, frogs and fish and we can get anything we need for them in one location for a fraction of the price as other stores. There is 1 older gal there and it kills me I can't remember her name right now but she is amazing! She is so knowledgeable and helpful! I hope she is the manager because she needs to be if not. Other employees are nice but none of them work as hard as she does by far!!</text>

Hi and Merry Christmas to all. Pet Club is always one of the best places to go for things for your animals. But I think still one of the best highlights is the old fashioned gumball machine. You can take your animals the kids the family and have a great time there.</review>

The staff was ready to help us. They gave my dog some treats with permission first. They gave us all the information we needed on the products for us to make the best choice. Overall great store! They also have VIP Pet Care there on Thursday and Sundays. It is a cheap price to get your pet up to date on all of it's shots.</Text>

Good selection, reasonable prices. Staff are nice and very helpful - always willing to carry stuff out for you if it's too heavy! Store does not accept credit cards, so make sure you have debit or cash (it's part of how they keep their prices low) Clean and pet friendly, lots of customers bring their dogs in to help shop.</Review>

She was extremely informative and made me quite confident in my plan for my new 10 gallon tank! She was also very nice and funny! More than happy to answer anything I might ask.

I really like this pet store! They are very well versed in knowledge of the animals and they have a good variety of fish. No birds last time I was there but hopefully they get them back soon they had very beautiful birds when they had them. The items here are pretty well priced and they make a good competitor to other pet stores price wise.</Review>

If you have a pet that eats live food, particularly feeder fish, this is by far the best place in Elk Grove to get them. The tanks are well maintained and always full of a unique collection of species. The staff in the Aquatic department is knowledgeable and helpful to a T. They always offer quality insight without coming off as sanctimonious, a fine line to walk. You can tell the staff at Pet Club are all pet owners and are actively interested in animal welfare and well being.< /text>

I have never been here before. My dog is on special food because he has a special diet. I usually get his food on Amazon because the vet charges way too much. My dog was out of food so I went to Pet Club and I saw that they had the food that he needs and it was $4 cheaper then Amazon. It was a plus because I did not have to wait 2 days to get the dog food from Amazon. We also bought some new bowls for him they were pretty comparable to Amazon. I will definitely go back again.<//text>

This store is awesome and the staff is great. If they don't have what you need they either can get it for you or they can find it. It's always clean and I love the fish and bird areas. The fish tanks are clean and decorated to keep the fish happy and the same for the birds. Thanks guys sure wish you were in So Cal.</Review>

They have some good sales. So I watch for the sales and stuck up when I can. Sometimes I'm just walking around and I'll see a new toy for one of the cats. So this is been a pretty good place to shop there's a couple other places right around by that if you want to get something when you're doing your pet shopping you can as well. And it's got a nice parking lot for parking in plenty of spaces they're usually not overly full.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x809ac71c8d435e7f:0x7dbedecf8c28712b< /gmapID></record>

<review>Great place for dog and cat supplies! They often carry great products the other big box pet stores don't have. I wouldn't bother with the reptiles or reptile supplies. The fish department is hit and miss. Often a good selection and the people are helpful but the fish quality is hit and miss. I still personally buy fish there but be careful.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Much better than the other two pet store chains down the street. More of a local pet store feel, and the staff member who runs the aquatic department is very knowledgeable and helpful. Prices are reasonable and we  enjoy shopping here.<//text>

I think the prices here for pet products is comparable to other pet supply stores. I believe they do offer a larger selection of high quality pet food compared to others however. Great place to get products for your cat, dog, fish, reptile, etc.< /text>

I've always been a fan of pet club stores as an alternative to the big guys. This location is great for cat and dog food but their fish section is sad. Quite a contrast from the Sunrise location. If you aren't looking for fish check it out, but if you are looking for fish prepare to be disappointed.</review>

Since I am a dog and have a rather large family to feed, I find it necessary to do my shopping at pet Club , the canines Costco. Preferably, I would hunt for my families nutritional needs, but who has the time for that these days? Pet club is the next best thing. Give your pets what they deserve.</review>

<review>I visited only because it was used as a stopping point for a traveling vet for cainine vaccinations. The store had wide isles, plenty of selection, and felt similar to Petco in it's offerings. Given a choice between this or Petco, I'd visit which ever was closer as I'm sure my needs would be met at either.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>Staff is great... never had a problem when buying fish. 1 week return policy on fresh with separate water sample. They will also order whatever you want if they do not have it in stock no extra charge which is nice. Very truthful I went to get a gold guarami the other day and she told me no the ones she just got in were no good wait until next weeks order came in. Most places would sell you the fish anyway</Text>< Name>

<review>Pet club is a really negotiable company dealing on character of trust, accurate customer information, and will talk to you step by step on any kind of situation your pet or what your pets need. I just bought a marine penguin tha that's a 75 gallon filtration and I brought back in for an exchange. It was working great for two weeks going on 3 weeks and the rubber wheel burned out causing the bearing to stick. I explained that it was only 3 weeks old and he thought it's been about six months not that it was an arguement. Like in said they are very customer friendly and after knowing its only been a few weeks, he understood and exchanged the penguine 75 gal. No problem and everyrhi g was taken and looked at professionally. Thank you pet club for your understanding and Visa versa as j would not cheat you on a product if it was my fault.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
Great customer service!! Don't buy fish from them. My fish I had for 15 years got sick and died after I purchased new fish from this store. I went back and talked to the fish lady and she sold me medicine and a 8 month supply of filters and all the fish still died. I am upset and will never shop at this pet store again if they don't make it up to me somehow. My fish i had for 15 years I am heartbroken.<//Review>

My family came here to get our first fish tank and were given advice on cycling, food, conditioner, tank size, etc. The employees were extremely helpful and polite, which isn't easy with all the questions we had. I looked up a lot of what they said and it all fit. I am very impressed by how well informed they are. We usually come here in the evenings to get the same employees. This store is our top pick out of any Petsmart, Petco, whatever for what we need and I will be coming here for my guinea pigs needs as well now. The prices especially for their aquarium kits are decent also. The cashier also seemed to remember us and was very friendly as well. Definitely recommend.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Melissa the fish lady needs to learn how customer service works.

If you have a customer waiting for 20 minutes with a fish in hand that they are trying to return you don't get to sit and chat and exchange Facebook information with a previous customer that entire time, while a line of other customers are waiting for you.

Then, when you manage to pull yourself away from your new infatuation for 2 minutes to take the fish, you should probably ask if the customer needs anything before walking away to go chat again with your newfound friend.

I mean damn, have a little situational awareness and common sense when you're on the clock.

Was planning to spend $100+ on pet supplies for my various animals + a new fish, but since Melissa couldn't be bothered to pay any attention I chose to take my money to PetSmart instead.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809ac71c8d435e7f:0x7dbedecf8c28712b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This store has the worst customer service, the clerks at the check out do not greet you, or even care that your are there. At the end of my $50 purchase all she said was here when she handed me the receipt. I have worked retail for many years and this store has been horrible on numerous occasions. I will not give them another chance for my business< /review>

Rude! Very rude around closing time! Awful customer service especially when the selfish cashiers are near the end of their shift.  ..I've had this problem with them a few times before!!..  I live across town and called before I left my house to make sure they would be open (they have the WORST weekend hours) the girl who answered said they were open til 7.. so I drove across town straight there to find other angry people at the door.. at 5:03pm ..they denied our phone call and rudely pointed at a sign on the door with the holiday hours for 5pm (it's Easter) ..fine lie to us and treat us like garbage because your selfish cashier wants to go home ..I drop $$$ on my pets and will be taking my business elsewhere- bad bad business ethics.. fail pet club management.. FAIL</review>
