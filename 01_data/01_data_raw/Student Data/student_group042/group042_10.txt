Very friendly staff! We were able to find a mattress we both liked. Got delivery set up for the next day fast and easy. Team has a lot of knowledge.

Adding an edit because we just bought a second mattress from the same place for our guest bedroom. I was helped by Destiny this time and she was so friendly and helped me find the perfect mattress. She showed me so many options for softer mattresses and real listened to what I wanted out of my bed set up.</text>

Spectacular experience!!

Shout out to Jose and Nick for helping my fiancé and I with our newest purchase! It was simple, easy, and as quick as can be for the type of order we had!

If you need a new mattress or pillows or just want some expert advice come see these guys!

I’ll see you guys in December for my new bed!<//Review>

Doug has gone above and beyond with getting my sister an awesome mattress with a free box spring as well as a mattress topper! He made the experience enjoyable, he was well knowledgeable, and he asked the right questions to find the exact mattress that was perfect for her. Doug is the best, make sure you ask for him first! Seriously, he knows his sh*t!<//Review>

To say that this was the ultimate mattress-buying experience of my life would fail to adequately convey my experience.
I entered the store hesitant, certain of what I wanted, but unsure how to find it, when Jason - like a masked superhero - dived to my rescue!
Valiantly he helped me navigate the treacherous terrain of Too-Many-Options, and guided me along the winding path to the final Secret-Mattress-Of-Eternal-Comfort - which, much to my surprise, was not what I had originally thought I wanted, but WAS nevertheless what I was hoping to find (and was still within my price range - yay!)

TLDR: It was really nice. :)<//Review>

<Text>Our salesperson Doug, was “very” knowledgeable and easy to deal with. We originally walked in to purchase a full size mattress for our guest room and ended up purchasing a new mattress for our bedroom too! Very happy with our decision, PLUS we can pay it off in two years INTEREST FREE! Thank you Doug!<//Text><time>1604113541669</time>< userid>

<text>My wife and I spoke with Doug from Mattress Firm on Blossom Hill rd in San Jose, CA and I have to say that he was very personable, helpful, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  Helped us find the right mattress and adjustable frame, and went over payment plan throughly.  I recommend speaking with Doug.< /text>< user_id>

<text>Nick the manager is the best!! Not only did he spend a ton of time with our family on a very busy day, he willingly followed up with me at least three times since we mistakenly ordered the wrong size bed (our fault-not theirs)! He never wavered each time I called with a new problem on our end (bed size, delivery reschedule) and even upgraded us to a better mattress. We couldn't be happier with the outstanding service and SUPER beds you'll find here.

I have nothing but great things to say about mattress firm. They're helpful, knowledgeable and have excellent customer service! Keep up the good work. I highly recommend Mattress Firm if you are in the market to purchasing a mattress or any sleep accessories. Calling and speaking with a sales associate over the phone versus purchasing over the internet is the way to go!</Review>

I called Jason Ram at this store asking about how to get my movable base working again.  It is five years old.  He found the original invoice in the computer and told me what to do to get warranty service.  He and his manager went the extra mile for me. As a result I have encountered exceptional customer service in the warranty service as well.  Thank you, Jason!<//Text>

My mother in law and my wife and I bought beds the same day.
My appointment was with Nick Bedel, Nick was amazing! We felt more like a family member than just another customer.
With my wife being disabled we have very specific needs and Nick listened intently to each one. We expected this appointment to take a long time due to our situation, but because Nick was so attentive to us we were in and out in less than 2 hours paperwork and all.
We can't thank Nick enough for his vigilance and amazing customer service! I have already informed multiple family members, who really need new beds, this is the place and person to go see.
Nick, thank you again for all you help, patience and understanding!< /text>

We are move out of the Bay Area to up North to a new home. Since living out of apartments and hotels with our Autistic son. We have been coming to what was (Sleep Train) now its Matterss Firm on Blossom Hill & Santa Teresa in San Jose for years. But only bought beds for our son. Now after us sleeping on air mattresses for years. It’s time for us. We deserve to get a bed of our own. That Evening was a date for us. Son with Therapist. Doug at the store was so Welcoming. He gave us great prices & discounts. He was very friendly and kind. There one else there but us. He said it was he closed. We just made it. But he never once told us he was on over time to help us. We were just having a great time with time. He was just like a old friend of the family.  Even though I am moving. I would drive the 5hrs back to order another bed from again I trust him.<//Text>

<Text>5 stars is not enough. Doug deserves 10 stars. He was so knowledgeable about mattresses. I have lower back pain and a sciatic nerve and sleeping on our old matress was very painful. Doug knew exactly what mattress I needed and gave me and my family the best customer service we could have ever asked for. This place is kid friendly they have a table with toys and a coloring area that intertained my daughter while we were finishing up our paper work. Doug had us laughing and really made this the best experience ever. Thank you Doug your awesome.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>We knew we needed a new Temper Pedic bed and we have had good experiences at this location when it was a SleepTrain on Blossom Hill. We knew it had merged with another company and were now "Mattress Firm", but we went in figuring we knew what brand of mattress we wanted (Temper Pedic), what type firmness and just wanted 2 adjustable sides of a King. What we discovered was that now there are many more options and types, especially of the bases. I figured we would be turning down anything that wasn't just simply for raising the head and feet. But then salesman Doug Kalpakoff began to really help us. He didn't just ask if we were side sleepers or back or stomach sleepers. He let us know how a choice in a base can affect circulation, sleep apnea issues, how age or weight affects how firm a mattress you want (he did so making fun of himself!). He did so without every pressuring us, but just asking us questions and informing us about the product, even being funny while he did it. He waited for as much time as we needed to lay on the beds and try them out. I seriously felt no pressure, and I will walk OUT of a place that gives me a hint of pressure because there is another Mattress place that sells Temper Pedic just nearby. Not only did Doug really help us understand options, he was so knowledgeable about sales that were going on. We saved more money than I thought we would, and I had already scoped out the sales. He would tell us information, then patiently sit back as we discussed, never trying to push us one way or another. We knew Temper Pedic is the best bed ever, but we didn't know we would love the new options and never would have spent the money if Doug hadn't educated us with no pressure. We are so glad we got the particular Temper Pedic and base we did. Go see Doug - he is worth it!</Review>< gmapID>

Haven’t bought a mattress yet but Doug was extremely helpful and straight forward. Will probably be coming back in a few days to pick up a bed 😁👍< /Review>

Richard is a great addition to this store.  Very courteous, we did not feel rushed, and the other staff helped entertain the kids while we tried out the mattresses.  Great success!<//Text>

I took the advice of your salesperson (Jovannah Nieves, who turned out to be the manager of another store!) and got the Bridgewater Luxury Firm mattress for $1400 and found it VERY undesirable. It was way too soft and when I looked for a replacement, the other products either didn't meet my expectations or were more expensive. I returned the mattress and was charged $149 which was totally unacceptable because I was NEVER notified of the expenses in advance. I didn't sign any documents and ordered the product and gave my credit card info over the phone later that day after I visited the store.

PS: The manager called me later and apologized for the whole thing and promised me a full refund of $149. A pleasant surprise!<//Review>

Walked in on a Sunday afternoon and needed a same day delivery.  I had an idea form the internet what I was looking for. The salesman was very helpful to show me my options and what was available for delivery same day. I decided on the split king size and tempurpedic Rhapsody Luxe and as they promised delivery was done around 9 pm and setup completed same day.< /text>

<Review>This SleepTrain is my go to place for mattress and frames. Nicholas helped us in 2014 with a queen iComfort with frame and backboard. We have been very happy and impressed with the quality. We went back last week and got two twin mattresses iComforts ordered for our daughters and had the privilege of having Nicholas help us again. Again we are very happy with the outcome.

Back in 2011 we purchased a frame and mattress from Mancini's that fell apart on us while we slept. They tried to replace it three times with more faulty furniture. The last time they tried the delivery guy couldn't get the frame to stop falling apart.

We have not had any problems with Sleep Train's frames or delivery personnel.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808e317faece74a3:0xf06449f145f46931< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Called on Friday to tell us our apartment wasn’t ready for a Monday move in.
Then made it seem like they did us a favor for loving us into another unit

There are junkies that hang around the parking lots and break into vehicles here almost nightly.  They say there is a “courtesy patrol” but in the two years I’ve lived here I’ve never seen anything.

The maintenance staff is incredibly friendly and does a great job.

Overall the only pro to this place is its proximity to the back gate of Pendleton.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Spacious and open layout. I like the management here. They go out of their way to help out with anything you need. Suzie and Jasmin are always eager to help. Pool and Hot Tub were resurfaced this year too. So, Thanks! for making me feel like family!<//review>

I had worked there for a year as a maintenance technician and while I was there my boss and my other guy quit and they left me as a assistant to do all 3 jobs, maintenance lead-maintenance tech - and the porter for the 300 room apartment complex Daily, with on-call everyday of every month.  They also never hired another guy while i was there the whole time!! They would consistently get mad at everything even though I was juggling 3 jobs at once and they still never appreciated or payed me for all the extra time and work I put in to save that place, They always told me the regional boss Brian would come and help .... he NEVER showed up to help and if he did show up he would sit in the office doing nothing alllllll day and also would make fun of workers and there performance,  he is one of the most unprofessional people I have EVER met. There are only 2 people in that workplace that are reasonable and nice and they are the front desk staff, lena and Jessica. besides that everyone is Always mean. The property is nice besides the mounds of pop everywhere and the trash cans being full constantly with ants everywhere.<//review>

I really like it here! The management team is awesome, super helpful with a move from overseas during covid. They communicate really well and schedule food truck visits and little things for the community (as much as they can with covid). The maintenance team works really hard to maintain the grounds and the units, I always see people picking up trash, gardening, etc. The apartments are nice and updated, pet friendly, high ceilings, washer/dryer, nice patio. The grounds are really nicely landscaped, its like a little oasis. Little dog park which is great, and people are always walking their dogs on the little loop around the apartment complex, so I've actually met a few neighbors.I've had a couple things fixed in the apartment and the maintenance team worked quickly. Downsides- not a huge fan of the mandatory Valet Trash since I only use it once every few weeks, but they always pick it up, and the Parcel Pending has some issues too. Others are mostly things that aren't the apartment's fault-a decent amount of young renters who don't throw away their trash properly, pick up after their dogs, keep the music down in their cars/apartments, etc. A few homeless people around-again, not the apartment's issue. The area is pretty safe outside a couple porch swipes and car break ins. I've lived in 9 apartments since 2012-a great maintenance and management team makes such a difference. Highly recommended!</Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Just moved in about a week ago, and I must say this is a very pleasant space.  My wife and I love the convenience of everything around( shops & restaurants), and the complex itself is fairly quiet.  Big thanks to Lena, our leasing agent. She made the process pain free and was always willing to answer any outside the box questions we had. The grounds are also very well kept which is nice.  I wish more people did pick up after their pets though, this would have been 5 stars.<//Review>< user_name>

I had a horrible experience!!! Their front office does not communicate well. I had nearly got electrocuted touching my shower curtain, they had installed long screws that were screwed into the power panel. They reward rule breakers. I paid for my parking spots (2) and if someone parked in my spot over night and I had to walk around the complex to get home, and when I would complain and ask for a tow truck driver, they would ask me to wait so they can send out an all call email asking for residents to move their cars. Seven months I had to put up with my upstairs neighbor drop his weights on the ground my ceiling for seven months, I complained and all the office would tell me is they are so sorry but there was nothing they could do and to call the police. This happened everyday all hours of the night the latest was 3:00 a.m. Also, same tenant would through loud parties until 5 am and nothing was done. The cops were called three times and once from my neighbor across from me because one of the party guests tried to kick down her door to get in. I complained and again nothing was done. The last and most disgusting thing is people leave their garbage outside of their apartments for days, it stinks and is totally unsanitary. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. WARNING: take pictures of apartment before and after, they keep your deposit( All of it).<//review>

<Text>I just moved here last week with my husband and do not regret a second of it. Lena and Ashley will take care of you as if you are apart of their family. I really appreciate how attentive the staff are and their passion for what they do. I can tell they aren’t being “fake” and they really do care about your needs. I would recommend this apartment complex because it is clean, the staff is amazing, and the welcome home feeling as you enter the complex. I can honestly say my apartment is not an apartment, it is my home. Thank you Capella at Rancho Del Oro Luxury Apartments for what you do for us.

This review is for Brian the  Maintenance guy. He is great! Very prompt and can fix anything! I had an issue with my water not getting hot and Brian went above and beyond to fix it, which he did and I have not had a problem with my water since! He also always follows up to make sure that everything is going well. He is very friendly and always kind and welcoming. My dogs love him too which is a plus!< /Review>

We have had issues with our air conditioning.  Our place gets so hot, especially since we're on the top floor and facing the afternoon sun.  Brian and Wendy have been great in helping us to find a solution to the heat!! Brian has checked in with us to make sure that we are happy and to keep us in the loop of what the property is planning on doing to address the issue. I truly appreciate him sharing the information and keeping us posted...makes me feel like he cares about the residents! He really takes his job seriously and wants to make sure that the residents are taken care of!! Thanks Brian!<//Text>

Future resident? No thanks! The main leasing agent with dark hair is an unprofessional jerk. The very thought of having to interact with him to any capacity for the span of a 12-month lease was enough to deter me from proceeding with this complex. I made an appointment online to tour the complex and view a 2bed/1bath for 4pm today, and received a confirmation email. I showed up at 3:55. The main leasing agent (the dark hard dude) saw me, made eye contact, and continued his conversation with the individual in the office. I was able to overlook that. However, then, he came out to talk to the pair who had arrived in front of me. I was sitting right there in the lobby. Not even a minimal "hello" greeting. He spoke for 10 minutes with said pair, and then exited and walked past me with a dismissive wave. Again, no "hello, I'll be right with you" or anything to that effect. He just pranced (yes, pranced is the most accurate verb utilization here) off, not even a couple feet from where I was sitting. My clock said 4:15 and I had yet to be even acknowledged. Rude guy, who probably needs to have a reality check. You are a mere leasing agent. Get over yourself- that is not an impressive place to occupy in this world. I have toured 5 places in the area this week, and have been met with all positive and respectful behavior until this visit. For what it's worth, from what I did see of the leasing office, it was nothing to write home about. The gym is by far the worst of any of the 5 comparable complexes I have visited, and the pool is tiny. The community itself is also not nearly as secure as other places I have visit in terms of entrance gates/access codes. The dude at the front is intolerable though...I should have read all the bad Yelp reviews on this place and not wasted my time to visit.< /Review>

I have been living in this community since 2017, it is a nice place to live in but like anywhere else sometimes it might have problems, but about those problems the management team always tries their best to solve and fix these issues. But even though they try their best personally I feel somethings fell off since I have moved here such as amenities offered like coffee, pool, and even, there is no trash bin in the mailroom anymore. I wish they would fix those faster and make it like before and beautiful.< /review>

<text>This complex has mold problems and refuses to take the problem seriously. They told us to scrub the windows with bleach, which we’ve done and the mold comes back. Bleach is not going to help if the mold is in the drywall and wood, which it is as you can see cracks in the paint and the problem keeps coming back. The last apartment complex (Less than a mile away) we lived at asked us to report mold immediately as they haven’t had any issues with it and wanted to take care of it before it became a serious problem. We never had mold on our windows there. Don’t move here unless you want allergies and mold poisoning.</text>< pics>

We recently moved to the community from Maryland. We hadn't visited the community before moving in just the surrounding areas. We picked Capella because of the reviews but we honestly didn't know what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised at how spacious our unit was. The community amenities are great and we are so close to many restaurants and shopping. I highly recommend Capella at Rancho Del Oro<//review>

<Review>The apartments themselves are Nice, they have a good color to them and a decent layout. I will start with Pro’s:
Maintenance department is always working and fixing the issues right away. Brian is doing his thing out here and he is always professional and helpful while work orders get fixed and completed in great time, no issues there. More than most I always deal with Ashley at the front desk, she always knows the answers to my questions and very helpful. Staff and maintenance have always been friendly and professional.
The apartment’s complex offers Starbuck coffee from a machine, computers, and Gym. I’m happy they finally locked the Gym door, didn’t seem safe keeping it unlocked all the time.
Cons:
The complex it self looks clean, but in the buildings and stairwells is full of spiderwebs all the time.
The “park” totally needs to be remodeled, and moved to a different location, it’s sad that’s what they call a park! The pool is decent, I’ve seen better and more clean pools in my friends cheaper complexes. They don’t offer, you pay for Valet trash, only on certain days they pick up and if they don’t your just paying extra to throw your own trash away. In the apartment itself, the only thing I have to Hate the most is the rundown Washer&Dryers they provide and the chalky paint that are on all the walls, horrible quality.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had an amazing experience with Capella during my stay.  I lived in a furnished one-bedroom apartment and I was impressed with the overall quality of the furniture and appliances that the apartment had.  I never had any issues with electricity or water, and the ability to leave the trash outside my door for pickup was extremely convenient.
The thing that set Capella apart from other places, in my opinion, would be the excellent staff that I dealt with; Jasmine, Gabby, Suzie, and Carie.  No matter who I was talking to, the staff at Capella always treated me with the utmost respect and were able to assist with any issue that I had in a quick and efficient manner.  Unfortunately I had to leave due to military orders but they made the process really simple for me, definitely military friendly.<//review>< resp>

Have been living here for over a year and it has its ups and downs like any living space.  Community is very clean and staff are very polite but can be a little disorganized at times, changes in management will do that though.  Rent is reasonable for long terms but shorter terms like 5 months will cause your rent to increase.  Overall a decent place to live.< /Review>

I love the new apartments, I was in a unit that had not been upgraded I went and asked the management if I could get into the upgraded unit, with that day they  had one for me. I moved into it a week later. It is beautiful inside, love having air and  a washer  and dryer in unit. The new appliances, floors and paint are very modern.

< review>
I love Capella at Rancho del Oro specially because for our family was hard to find an apartment that was ADA complaint. Their units have wide doors so my husband can move his wheelchair freely. The management is very friendly and helpful ans the amenities are awesome. We go to the gym everyday!<//review>

I had normal apartments that didn’t have the “luxury in their name that preformed better. I’ve had many work orders, such as 3+ times to fix the washer that continuously bangs multiple times. Causing us to dry our clothes, therefore increasing our Electric bill. Don’t stay at capella, it’s a waste of money. My significant other asked me not to post it, afraid that we might be kicked out, but I think that’s a great idea to end our lease early :) oh yeah, the gym isn’t 24 hours. I’m excited for our lease to end soon.< /Review>< rating>

Jasmin the leasing agent was amazing! I really enjoy the view of the mountains from the 3rd story which is a pain in the butt to have to walk up the stairs but keeps me in shape. The views are amazing and the apartments have lots of beautiful open lighting for some life in your home. I Love the amenities , the upgraded gym, the pool area. The tropical look in the community. Pet friendly with dog park. I love my apartment and the upgraded unit! I must say having a washer and dryer in unit is amazing and the ceiling fans and the AC/Heater is a plus! Coming here from a apartment one block from the beach with terrible property management, mold, water problems, leaks and paying about the same price is not worth living by the ocean! I miss living by the ocean but I love living here more. My health is now 100% better since moving to Capella, be careful where you rent most of these places have problems that you may not be aware of and start getting sick all the time and wondering why! I'm happy to say I'm enjoying my everyday living here so far and my health hasn't felt this good in years. P.S. great service anything you need they are quick to respond.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!

Amazing Apartments. The insides are high quality, beautiful, and feels more like a house than an apartment. Maitenence is great, and the complex even had dog bags provided, barbecues,  a park, and a dog park. Outside is beautiful, and clean. The office is amazing, they often have little parties where kids are welcomed and encouraged. They are very kind, and are very accepting of children. 10/10 reccomend.</text>

<Text>MILITARY FAMILIES BE AWARE!!! The first impression is amazing, the apartments are even better, and the move IN specials - WOW, wonderful...

1. Their communication is HORRIBLE

2. They gave our assigned parking spot to someone else AND THEN TRIED TO GET US TO MOVE so they wouldn’t look dumb to the other family.

3. They NEVER returned a call. NOT ONCE.

4. When we did move-out, they tried to charge us over $800 after telling us ... during our move out inspection, “just the patch of carpeting needs replacing.”

So after CALLING and no return call, I set an in-person appointment. NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THAT PERSON ON OUR ACCOUNT.

At this point, we don’t know how much we owe them or what is happening so THEY SENt US TO COLLECTIONS.

After reporting them to BBB (a complaint they still have yet to respond to) and sending an e-mail to corporate, they dropped our account to $160. Our account sat at $160 for weeks without anyone updating us until I WENT INTO THE OFFICE (because calling doesn’t do anything) and finalized my freaking account.

Don’t do it. there are better, more GENUINE complexes in Oceanside.  It might be easy to move-in now but long-term, you will regret it.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

All in all, my wife and I had a great experience living here.  I definitely miss how the apartment is just right by the 76, and how close it is to Sprouts, Petsmart, In 'n' Out, and other restaurants and stores.  The location certainly cannot be beat.

As for the complex itself, it is very clean and well-maintained, with some awesome amenities such as a coffee machine in the office, a 24 hour gym with free weights, and a 24 hour package locker.  Yes, there is a one-time fee for the package locker, but I think it is awesome for the convenience and peace of mind.  And here I am in my current house with a noticeably wider waist, fumbling around with the coffee pot not knowing how much water I need to put in, all while spying constantly out the window for my packages lest the package thief gnomes beat me to them.  Yes, I miss these amenities dearly.

The maintenance staff is probably the best I've ever had out of every apartment complex I've lived at.  Any issue that would come up would be addressed and fixed within 24 hours or less of my request.  The leasing office staff are likewise attentive and courteous.  It helps that they loved my dogs and that my dogs loved them.

The place is not perfect.  There is a mandatory trash service for 20 dollars a month.  This service might be convenient for people who live on the third floor apartments, but we lived not 30 feet away from one of the apartment dumpsters.  We were basically shelling out 20 bucks a month for a service that we never used and couldn't opt out of.  I would ask to see if this policy has changed, as I did notice neighbors who did not seem to have the trash bins for the service.

As other reviews have noted, there definitely can be serious problems with communication, though I suspect the fault lies not with their personnel, but with the means by which they handle communication.  There was a minor incident over our keys when we moved out, with the complex mistakenly believing that we never turned them in when we in fact did.  After two emails and two messages left with their off-site team failed to resolve the issue (we received an additional email from Capella the next day stating that penalties will begin), I had to personally drive to the complex in person.  Turns out the leasing office team never received our messages from the off site team that was supposed to relay them,  or at least the messages simply never showed in their computer system.  Luckily, everything was resolved right then and there, but I can see how frustrating it might be for others trying to contact Capella, especially those who already moved out of state.

Would I live here again?  Absolutely, in a heart beat, despite the flaws.  The location is beautiful and convenient, and other than the occasional kerfuffle with communication, the service provided by the maintenance and office staff is beyond impeccable.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1547163223096, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving this detailed feedback about your experience with us.

Dont live here. They are over priced. They dont ever answer the office phones. They have a call center and they supposedly relay the messages. I have mold in my apt. and I called it in over the weekend and they have yet to fix it which is now Wednesday. I had two leaks in the garage and they cut holes on the ceiling to fix it, it has now been more than two weeks and nothing. Steer clear of this place. If I didn't have a lease, I would have already been gone.<//Text>

After grabbing some coffee, tea, or hot chocolate you can lounge around the lobby or take your beverage to the poolside - or into the hot tub. Why not?

Maintenance has fulfilled all of our work orders promptly and to our satisfaction. The gym is clean and has enough equipment to satisfy most needs - a few different cardio contraptions, a Smith Machine, dumbbells, and kettlebells that go up to 35lbs.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>BUYER BEWARE I would like to strongly encourage people NOT to rent here. Read the reviews please! There is a resident at this property that is being discriminated against so horrifically and unjustly that is breaks my heart. I was considering moving to this property when I relocate to California. I got online and I started reading reviews. I came across the very first review from a disabled woman who has a service animal and was being seriously discriminated against. At first I was hesitant to believe it then I read her husbands review. I had to know the whole story so I reached out to her. The things she told me she has endured from this property as well as the evidence to back it up is nothing short of seriously disturbing. I was considering moving my mom( who's disabled) brother and a few friends here as well as myself. Before I did I inquired and via email on several occasions 2 different women both with the same name Rachel who is a leasing consultant and Raechel who is the Assistant Manager first tried to force me into a 2 bedroom apartment that is avail now knowing I'm preganant and need more space then after the Assistant Manager claimed that there was a larger unit coming open next month I continually asked what the unit number was so I could apply and she kept sending quotes for one that's available now. I kept getting pressured to speak on the phone when I made it clear I preferred email due to my disability this was shown a total disregard by the staff at Capella. Then, when both ladies were asked about the reviews on yelp from that woman and her husband they were either vague, or avoided answering it all together which I think sheds a lot of light and shows the validity of the statements made by the woman and her husband.  The Assistant Manager Raechel said she had just transferred to the property from another state and couldn't speak on it with truth as she wasn't working here when it happened. As much as I do believe her I don't believe she knows nothing about the situation. I think she is like the rest of the people here attempting to save face. It appears from the many reviews that this is only one of the serious issues this complex faces. They thrive on the bait and switch tactic. I have gone a few steps further to see that they have a F rating on the Better business bureau. Seems to me this is a less than honest company and if you want better for your family don't move here. Take it from a person who was going to move here and got treated the way I did. Needless to say, I don't think this is a complex that anyone should rent from and should be shut down if this is the stuff happening there and not being rectified in a manner other than the woman being bullied out of her home. I can only pray with everything I have that this woman gets the justice she deserves and this property gets what they deserve for treating people that way. If you doubt what I've written just read the review for yourself and if you still doubt it reach out to her she was very honest and forthcoming with what us happened to her. I hope the owner reaches out and rectifies the problem before it happens to anyone else. No wonder this place has so much availability. READ REVIEWS PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS! This isn't a woman who's simply scorned it's a woman seriously legally done wrong by crooks. Blessings all.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

First and foremost, when something seems too good to be true, it usually is!!!! From day one, the entire office has been completely incompetent. Basically begging them to process my application and lease for literally two weeks. I called and called and called and called and voicemails and messages with other people and finally two weeks later it was taken care of. Do not expect them to help or explain anything at all. Why I thought it would get any better after moving in, I have no idea.

The other reviews mention rats and bugs, and I asked Jasmin about it- oh it's from the previous rental holding company and people were upset with the changes. I move in and find rat droppings in the balcony and one of the bedrooms.

Red flag: usually changes for the good make people happy!!! As you can see the other reviews yourself, not the case here at Capella!!!

So sadly, I make the mistake to move in, the whole setup was rushed and barely explained. Coming from NYC to oceanside, we don't have anything called a carport or have issues comprehending normal parking rules. During the tour I even pointed my dirty car that took the cross country trip to her, as she had damage on her car that was parked directly blocking my car into the doomed parking spot. After explicitly not being explained the parking rules or even given an option to purchase an assigned spot, or even given a copy of my lease electronically or written by my "helper" Jasmin, my car was towed from the spot it was parked in for the entire week I have lived here. I call the complex, and Gabby was absolutely incompetent and unconcerned with handling the problem. I was told I'd get a call back yesterday after requesting to hold for Jasmin, and she leaves 20 minutes early before my wife can even get down to the office from the apartment. Even if it had been my fault for any reason at all, there are still customer service rules that apply and as a customer I am extremely displeased with my living situation and will pursue them in court for the towing charges as well as break my lease.

They "register" your plate at sign up but do not reference it or even keep a database of resident license plates.

Do yourself a favor, heed the other warnings in the reviews before me and don't be a hero thinking it will be different with you!!!< /text>

<Review>Do not trust Trinity Property Consultants, do not sign a lease with them. I have termites in my Trinity run townhome in Phoenix. Exterminators came in and claimed to take care of the issue. A month later, the place is infested with them. I have mud tubes going into couches and I'm responsible financially to repair or replace my furniture after their contractor failed the first go around. I'm sure this is a nationwide corporate policy, think twice before signing on with Trinity.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

NOT WORTH THE PRICE TO LIVE HERE TRUST ME! Even if you can stand the outrageous pricing at first, they definitely don't care about keeping you for more than your lease. For the 2 years I've lived here, the only way to keep up with the price hikes has been to get a roommate, but from trying to increase it $300+ the first time and now $250 they are not making it feesable to live here any longer. They probably justify the increases by blaming it on the market, but the unnecessary repainting of the buildings and expensive leasing office renovation, that also wasn't needed, are most likely to blame for the pricing. They are doing some good things like creating the little dog park area as well as upgrading the apartments as tenants move out, but honestly they aren't upgrading them enough.

The apartments still have single pane windows that don't even close all the way and have the seals broken which is terrible for heating and cooling costs. The walls in the bathroom have a ticking noise every time the water is turned on that is loud enough to wake you up at 4 in the morning. The cabinets are old and just get repainted so the paint chips off easily, and the counters have chips in them as well. The AC units are old and not very efficient so it becomes very expensive very fast.

This place may look very inviting and nice at first glance, but the management does not have your best interest in mind at all. They are all about a fast turn around with the outward appearance to draw you in and they don't really care about keeping you after your lease is up.

Oh, I also want to note that my husband's motorcycle was stolen from here and my car broken into. So be careful about leaving anything valuable in your cars and have some sort of alarm system for your bike because I have never even seen the "security guards" that they had supposedly told to increase their rounds after we told them about the bike.

Honestly, we probably would have stayed if they were more reasonable about their pricing, but they ruined it by increasing it so much too fast so now they can't back down in their pricing yet it's getting too high for people to be able to keep up with them.

Oh yea, they also try to bribe people into giving them good ratings by entering you into raffles if you do.< /Text>

< review>
These Apartments are Nice , they do keep up the the Landscape , ( if you are working the Night Shift 😵 I will say GOOD LUCK !! They WILL WAKE YOU UP before 7:00- 7:30, )VERY EXPENSIVE Place 😱😱 to live here  !! There ISN'T Nothing  LUXURY here . Here are a  FEW example 's  since the 3rd OR 4th New Owner's
1) They let go , All of the Maintenance  personnel 's ( Which all of them was Amazing 😊 )  . They went Far an Beyond with there Work Orders who had a request for something that needed to be fixed.
This NEW Owner's , WELL ...... They are so Short on Staff , that , your request will take time .
2) IF and I say  ". IF. "  you would like to have your own parking spot , WELL .... That is an EXTRA  $20.00-$25.00  a month .
3)  IF you would like to have a Garage , WELL... that start's around $125.00 - $150.00 .
4) ALL of the Apartments Complex are NON- SMOKING .
5) You are NOT allowed to Decorate your Private Patio . aka ..say that you would like to hang some Very Light Sheer Curtains on the Thresholds to help keep the Sun from BLAZING INTO your apt. Which will help keep your Electric Bill down . NOPE ... NOT ALLOWED .
5) Make sure you have PLENTY OF LAMPS or ANY KIND of Light fixtures .
Because , there ISN'T NONE in only of the Rooms .( except the Kitchen and Dining Room ONLY)
6) Yes .... These Apartments are Nice looking , especially the Landscaping , which they are always changing them out for each different season of the year.
7) This is my  ( OWN PERSONAL OPINION ONLY ) . I have seen this MANY TIMES ON JUDGE JUDY , SO....... Take this advice in advance .
You ALWAYS take PICTURES ( with the Date and Time they was taken before you move in )
All this is doing, is covering your ASS  " IF. "
it come time for your Move out Date OR  if you need to  leave /  move unexpectedly .
8) The New Office Personnel , I have had the Pleasure of knowing  for the few months that they have been here, are very Kind , thoughtful as well as helping you out in difficult time 's . They will help you and are very understanding . But Business is Business<//review>

I stayed here for one year. The place is extremely expensive, offers no customer service and has overbearing landlords. When you sign the lease, you agree to pay all the fees to bring the apartment back to "show-room condition" so be prepared to pay $300-500 on top of your security deposit. I showed the lease to a lawyer who said he never seen such a thing in his life, but I signed the lease so lessons learned.

Also, if you are planning on living someplace long term don't come here. They will raise your rent every year. A loophole in California law allows landlords to raise rent every year as long as your notified 90 days in advance of your lease ending, my apartment was set to go up another 150-200 a month (I forget the exact amount).

The apartments look very nice, but the way they are run is extremely shady. This is a business not a home, and unless you are willing to contribute to the business' bottom line, don't become a part of it.< /Review>

<text>This was  a great place to live, albeit an expensive place, the biggest complaint I had was if you live in the apartments near College Blvd get ready for tons of noise from street traffic. It's one of Oceansides busiest streets. Everything from ambulances heading to Tri-City to 18 wheelers rumbling by at 5 in the morning to street racers at night. If you're getting a place there and they show you an apartment near the College Blvd side decline the offer. It's really hard to block out the amount of street noise.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
New management is trying to drive residents away. First they painted everything the most hideous colors possible and put up signs reminiscent of a cheap seafood restaurant. They closed the clubhouse for months, leaving construction debris strewn throughout the parking lots only to open the building redesigned for their use, not the residents.

At Christmas they lost a package. Found it a couple months later and then instead of an apology they blamed us. I had been in 17 times looking for the package. Oh, it was food and clearly labeled perishable, but don't expect them to read. But, they've fixed that, now they CHARGE you to receive mail.

Latest horrible idea, valet trash. Instead of walking our trash out we now leave it in the hallway during the peak time that we might have visitors over. You're going to end up paying someone to take your trash out whether you want to or not and put up with everyone else's stinky trash to boot.

Compared to the previous management they are inept and unfriendly. Why would you want to live somewhere where you get nickeled and dimed for services you don't want?< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!! They charge an arm and a leg when you move out and will charge you extra days if they so called "don't receive your keys from the weekend". The apartment falls apart and is cheap but they have you pay more than what it's worth. The management is unprofessional and never gives you a call back when you try to leave messages regarding your move out and final statement. Do not waste your time on these apartments they are a compete joke but if you do not take my warning good luck and you will be in for a world of oweing them more money than they are worth.<//review>< Pics>

I was quoted 7000-8000 to repaint my car Toyota, it is a Supra that is a small coupe, didn't ask for any special colors just the basic 202 black that came on the car, no repairs just respray because the car is older and needed a fresh paint job. I was quoted by other quality shops in the area all between 3400-4200. I have been in the automotive industry for over 25 years, have worked at at body shop in the past for several years and know what goes into a quality paint job and can honestly say that if a paint job was work 7-8k I would happily be painting cars right now... This company has some nerve trying to charge that kind of money for a basic paint job with no body work or crazy paint schemes. If this was a crashed car or I wanted some wild show car paint job that has a lot of different colors in it maybe but this is a black car that was to be repainted the same exact color.

The following is for a 2010 Honda Accord EX
I came here to get an auto repair estimate and the front desk was very helpful. The employee who assisted me was also helpful in giving me the quote for the repair. They were able to explain everything to me in detail as well.< /Review>

Over the past 20 years or so my family has used Skill Craft probably about 6 times.  We have never had a bad experience.  They have always been professional, performed the absolute finest quality work, and kept us apprised regularly.  Most importantly, they do this fantastic work as quickly as possible, as if you are the most important customer they have.  Shout out to Andy for his great management of the project.  That was especially important this last time since my wife's car was struck from behind by a motorcycle while parked, and the damage was almost $11,000.  Andy got it done in a timely manner, and it looks like new.  We very much appreciate the work you guys do!< /review>

<user_name>Cedric Anderson<//user_name><Text>An exceptional auto body repair shop. Andy, the estimator was terrific , very competent and considerate in all phases of the vehicle repair. I also appreciate all his updates on the vehicle and the parts that had to be shipped here.  The repairs done to our 2017 vehicle had the same quality appearance as when we first bought it. I want to extend a special thanks to the repair technicians and the office staff. We are extremely satisfied.

Went in for an estimate to paint a brand new fairing. They said that they didn't want to do it and I heard the manager say that it was candy and to shoo me away.
So my job was small and the candy was too much for them. I guess all the new cars with Pearl's and candy finishes are too much for them to repair.
Wow!</text>

I went to Skill Craft Body Shop, not looking for an estimate for body work I needed done, but simply to ask a question about an emblem I was planning to re-affix to my car after it was stolen.

Even though I was looking to do body work business with them, they took the time to hear my concern. And not only did they spend time helping me figure out a remedy, they actually discussed my problem among themselves and actually provided a remedy and fixed my issue!

While they were discussing the matter outside of my sight, I noticed that they were an Auto Club approved facility. I've been an Auto Club member for 28 years and I know the type and standard of business one has to be to be a part of that esteemed club.

The way they took care of me, even when they were under no obligation to do so, leaves me without wonder as to why they are a Auto Club, top-notch business. If they treated me this way, and I wasn't even a customer, I cannot imagine them providing anything less than caring professional service to anyone else.

If you're considering taking your care there, do it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.  All the best!< /Text>

Full-blown amateurs, shoddy work, replacement parts are all Chinese.

They work for the insurance companies not the customers. They try to nickel and dime you on the deductibles
They don’t stand behind their work, they have nothing but excuses and they cannot deliver.

They would literally be the last place I would take my automobile two to get it repaired for insurance work or private work.<//text>

<Text>The receptionist greeted us and made us comfortable and then introduced us to Mark. He evaluated the damage and helped us through the paperwork.
Mark was in touch with us throughout the whole process. We needed the car done in four days. Mark told us they would try to get it done for us but was not comfortable with a hard promise. I realize there are variables that cannot be foreseen so I appreciated his honesty. There was one dent he missed on the first appraisal, it was hidden under the side marrow. He asked us to came back to see it. It was a hidden ding. It was added and insurance covered it.
In fact, the car was finished ahead of promised time!
The receptionist helped us with the payment and gave us a bag for our paper work. It was a very good experience.
Thank you, SlillCraft.<//Text><Date>1407964698098< /Date>< rate>

I was referred by AAA because we got rear ended in our brand new car :(  SkillCraft Body Shop was very professional and handled everything with care.  They finished the repairs 2 days earlier.  It was great that I rented a car through Hertz at their location too.  Although the Hertz people were not someone I would want to deal with again.  Hertz was not professional what so ever.  But the good thing was I was able to drop off the rental car at SkillCraft and Hertz picked it up from there.  The car looks brand new again and AAA paid for everything so I didn't even have to pay anything to SkillCraft.  They made it painless.  Thanks SkillCraft!</text>

Everything was done well and I've used them 3 times now. So far all the repairs have held up well for years. No orange peel or hazy paint, the repairs frankly look good as new.

My second experience here was so-so. I've come to the conclusion that you need to ask for Lewis. He goes above and beyond. Granted the actual work is done by the same guys, but he clearly does some QA to make sure it is right before he hands you your keys. So be sure to insist Lewis take care of you!</text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>I need to place my most recent experience with Skill Craft into context.  I have had repair work done at Skill Craft several times over the past few years.  Each time the work has been expensive, but exceptional.  I keep coming back because I believe that the quality is worth the expense.

So what happened this time???

About three weeks ago I took my 2011 Lexus sedan to Skill Craft to have numerous scratches and scrapes on the hood, doors, fenders and bumpers repaired and refinished.  A Skill Craft estimator INSPECTED the car and we agreed on a price for the repair work.  I left the car and in a few days received a call that the work was complete and that it was ready for pick up.  I picked it up and inspected the work and noticed that the work was of the same outstanding quality I had come to expect from Skill Craft.  I paid the bill and drove home.

A few days later I noticed that the hood had ten or so dimples in the paint.  These were each about 1/8 inch in diameter and shallow in depth.  I could see that the new paint that had been applied by Skill Craft was in the edges and bottom of these dimples, so I knew these dimples were caused by their workers not properly refinishing the hood.  I called Skill Craft and we agreed that I would take it in for their inspection.  I was told there was no hurry to bring the car in because Skill Craft has a lifetime warrantee on their work.  Because of travel out of state I wasn’t able to take the car to Skill Craft for about two weeks.

When I did take the car back I met with one of their service representatives who told me that the dimples were caused by “rock chips” that were there before the hood was refinished.  I reminded him that he had inspected the hood originally and knew I wanted it to be refinished without “rock chips” showing after finishing.    I asked about the “lifetime” warrantee and I was told the warrantee applies only to the “quality” of their work.

I had to pay several hundred dollars for the cost to refinish the hood again.  I really didn’t think this was fair nor was it a good business practice…I guess their warrantee of the “quality” of their work doesn’t apply to the “quality” of their inspection.

I probably won’t return to Skill Craft for future work.  I recommend that if you do, be cautious of their inspection of your car and be sure to ask them what is covered under their warrantee?

Fantastic service. Went out of their way to verify whether or not the diagnostic code readout was the actual problem. They found a different issue and corrected that instead for a lower cost than it would have taken to replace the initial fix. The techs are honest, great at their jobs, and happy to help you. Highly recommended!</text>

This is a great shop thus far. I've only needed basic maintenance so will update when something more major comes up, but I've really appreciated how upfront and honest everyone here is. I've felt that the prices are reasonable, and that all the work done on my car is necessary (i.e. that no one is trying to recommend work that doesn't need to be done or overcharging). It's been super fast when I've taken my car in, and I plan to come in regularly in hopes of keeping my  Toyota around for a long time! :)< /text>

I had just picked up my truck in San Diego around 11am from a shipping company and started to hear a rattling noise coming from inside the truck. Hesitant to continue my trip to 29 Palms, I began calling local mechanics in San Diego to take a look inside the truck but kept getting rejected. Fortunately, Mira Mesa Automotive was willing to take a look. Not only did they diagnose the problem, but assisted me in resolving the issue in a quick manner. I am extremely grateful for this business. It has my highest recommendation!!<//Text>

This shop was fantastic! The owner helped us fix a flat at 5:20 on a Friday. We tried Firestone and Big-O and were turned away. It was a big deal as we were in SF for a camping trip in from LA and had no other options. Great service and even better pricing. Highly recommended.< /Text>

I've been taking my wife's, my son's, and my cars to them for over 10 years. They have always been honest and reasonable. They have offered less expensive but solid alternatives to save money; and also provided tips and suggestions to prevent issues and prolong the life of the car. In 30+ years of car ownership, I have only found fewer than a handful of good honest car repair places. They are one of them.< /Review>

These guys are great! I had a problem getting my catalyst monitor to set. I went to two places that told me just to dive it around and eventually it will set. After a week it didn't and the shops I went to told me to just keep driving. I was ready to buy two new catalytics for my 2000 Tacoma. After calling Mira Mesa Auto the recommended I bring it in and get the truck evaluated. The recommended cleaning and adjusting a couple of sensor, which they did in a timely matter. They were very fair with the price and got my truck to pass smog. I was very impressed with their service and will go back to them again.</review>

I never got my car fixed there and just mostly for smog check for my Camry. They are always nice everytime I visit them every year. One thing I do know is that they are always packed with customers and that translates to good and trusted service.<//text>

They're good but they are expensive. Usually they would charge their service 3 times the parts.  Wish they would be cheaper. Paid for front brakes $75. Labor to install $180.</text>

<text>As far as I can tell the job was completed, mind you it’s only been 2 days. But as I review the invoice I realize most of the $700 bill we received was labor. From the time I gave them the ok to fix it to the time they called and said it was done, it was 2 hours. Some how there are 5.5 hours worth of labor charges. So I’m confused as to how this works. Parts were $200 total. So $500 in labor for 2 maybe 3 hours of labor seems a bit ridiculous. Will not be returning.< /text><Name>Bill Armstrong< /Name>< user_id>

Got a love letter from the DMV telling me that I needed a smog from a STAR Station, (whatever that is)....so I looked up STAR Stations on the interweb that are within 2 miles of my home and located Mira Mesa Automotive Repair Inc.  After looking at reviews for them as well as their competitors I made an appointment for the same day.
I would like to give MMAR Inc a VERY STRONG POSITIVE recommendation.  Everyone was very professional, efficient and caring.  An excellent experience, in and out, no hassle and they were happy to accept their discount coupon that I printed from their website and presented to them when I arrived.</text>

These guys went so far out of their way coming up with excuses to actually give me an estimate on a particular job that I know should take a little more than 3 hours. Basically all I wanted was an estimate to unscrew a sensor, and then screw another sensor back into that empty space , that I would provide myself. I feel bad for customers out there who have absolutely no clue how cars work, and lines like " your car has more than one Knock Sensor" are things that they'd actually believe.</Text>< Pics>

The buck stops here, this place can fix most anything. Tried taking an older model car to 2 other places on the same block, but those places didn't know what to do with it! These guys not only knew what to do with it, but did such a thorough fix that the car passed smog with flying colors! Great one stop smog and repair shop, no need to bounce back and forth between a repair and smog shop.<//Review>

be careful tho don't show up to do a smog check with your check engine light on, they will take your car have you wait a half hour and tell you that your emissions are great but your lights on.... so you fail next time don't leave your gas cap loose, after which they will tell you to come back in a few days so they can charge you again.</Text>< pics>

They litteraly took my car in hostage and didnt let me take it out pretexting its unsafe to drive it unless i accept to pay the very expansive price of the things that they want to charge me for that's actually where unnecessary my car was driving just fine but they just want to force me to take their service. thieves !!!!!< /Review></record>

<Text>I have mix feelings about this place. They quoted me $550 for an alternator replacement. After 4 hours of my car being at the shop, the lady called me by phone to tell me that the part was going to go up in price $100 more because the part was hard to get, i told her that i needed to make a few phone calls to differen shops that had quoted me less. She calls me 2 minutes later to tell me that they moved the numbers around and that they were going to leave the price at the original price of $550. They charged me $350 for the part and $200 for labor. I had called an auto zone before and they had the part there at $175. I thought that for $350 they would put a new part but they put a remanufactured part instead. They resold me the part for twice the price plus 2 1/2 hours of labor at $90 an hour.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1505335685763, 'text': "I'm sorry we did not meet your expectations . we offer a 2 year 24,000 mile warranty on all repairs and that's nation wide . sorry we cannot use that company for that warranty ."}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Popped in here yesterday morning and picked up two CDs and four DVDs, all used and in perfect shape, except for one DVD that I bought new due to it's cult rarity.  Got a killer deal and had the greatest time browsing and losing myself in their huge selection.</review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>For quality made, handy bites for breakfast or lunch in the area, this is a pretty convenient spot. There's easy parking and it's located just across the Irvine train station.They cater to the train commuters ("station") and workers at the nearby business parks with their simple, on-the-go, menu.

I've had a few things here from: breakfast burrito, wraps, panini sandwich, salad and coffee drinks. Breakfast burritos and the chai coffee are solid, paninis are good and filling but isn't greasy and doesn't weigh down heavy. I actually just had their spinach salad with the added tuna salad for my working lunch. This thing is still sitting on my desk, half eaten cause it's quite huge. Nothing fancy but nicely put together and enjoyable. As with anything I've had here, all is made to order.

They have a few tables inside and out. But for the most part, it pretty much is a place for fast, easy and out the door service. They don't deliver but they do take orders over the phone. Pickup is currently the only option. The owners are cool, always friendly and aim to please.

Well, that's about it. Now, back to work.... :)</review>< date>

Family run shop it seems and they're all super nice.  Come in once or twice a week.  Their paninis have the best bread.  They make a really solid latte and I really like the cold brew as well.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>We found Station Cafe I as a randomly seeking for a breakfast for my very hungry crew at Pristine Plumbing.  We have morning meetings twice a week and it’s hard to change up breakfast.  Kim at Station Café took my order a week ago for a variety of breakfast panini sandwiches.  They were a hit with everyone.  The panini was light and crisp with fresh ingredients.  They delivered breakfast burritos this morning.  Very good, but the sample salads were a hit.  We are wanting to eat healthier, so their variety hits the spot.  Call Kim for great service, Deborah @ Pristine Plumbing< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>This place was such a nice surprise. I was working in the area and yelped coffee shops and found this place. The baristas are very knowledgeable in coffee and made me an amazing latte (see picture). Parking was a bliss as you can just park in the train station parking structure for free. I'll definitely make this a regular stop.</Text><user>111782455990750280302<//user><GmapID>0x80dce801b27f19c1:0xfcfabf636f6bbc9c< /GmapID>< response>

This is a cute little spot at the "transportation center" in Irvine. I had the lunch special, which was a half panini and choice od green salad, caesar salad or chips. I chose the caesar. The dressing for the salad was okay. The flavor of the sandwich was good. There was not enough chicken, though. I think if they added even 1 ounce more it would have made a  huge difference in the quality of the sandwich. The place was very clean and the staff was friendly.<//review>

Centrally located place and the paninis are just OK. Located at the train station which provides a decent food option for traveling but the food is basic and just OK. Nothing special to write home about.< /Text>

They know how to make great espresso and use Stumptown coffee beans. I recommend the egg and tomato panini.</text>

<text>I can't tell you how happy I am this place opened! I work in the area and there isn't much around unless go to the busy Irvine Spectrum Center mall. It's family owned, which is nice. The coffee is fantastic and brewed in L.A. The people are friendly and they remember your order. And the panini sandwiches are made with fresh focaccia bread. Sooo good! The only thing I haven't tried yet are the breakfast sandwiches, but I'm sure I will soon!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>I have been going to THE JOINT for 5 years and signed up both of my children as well.  Not only do the Drs. know how to adjust us they are  family friendly and take such good care of our health. They always greet us with a smile and love which we appreciate.  Dr. Lee runs a nice operation for all I suggest you check it out if you have a spine (on your body that is).
We all need care for our spines and nervous system.  The best!<//review>< pictures>

I love this place. Friendly people. Great hours. Walk-ins welcome. I have an erratic schedule and I work long hours. I never know when I will have free time, so it's great to be able to walk in when I am free and not have to make an appointment. They are open later than most doctors' offices and they have weekend hours. Clearly, they value working folks' time.</Text>

I have seen my fair share of chiropractors in relation to my SI/hip pain over the past few years, but none have provided me the kind of comprehensive and personal care Dr Benjamin Higier did in just one visit. I have never liked or prefered one chiro over another enough to go back specifically to them until today. Dr Higier took the time to talk to me, ask me questions, and make his own assessment and recommendations rather than review a sheet of paper and have me in and out in 2 minutes. He provided me with education, sent me home with stretches and exercises to review, recommended adding physical therapy into the mix (first time a chiro has ever mentioned this to me), and if the problem persists offered to write for an MRI to see if there's something further going on than just a loose joint. I really felt as though he wanted to help me get to the bottom of my SI pain and help me find a resolution rather than just provide temporary relief. I appreciate his expertise and look forward to coming back to him regularly and would recommend him to anyone else in the area looking for an excellent chiropractor.</Text>

My back was really bad. Walking was a chore. My intuition told me that I needed an adjustment. So I went to The Joint. I had been a couple times before & their rates are Very reasonable. Went on a Friday evening , was adjusted and immediately felt the pressure release. By Sunday I felt normal again. YEE HA!!
Thank You 🙏 Thank You 🙏 I have decided to go back for one session a week for a month to take care of my body. And stretch. Don’t forget to stretch. 👍👍 I whole heartily recommend  The Joint. They sure helped me. 🙂<//Text>

If I could give them zero stars I would. The chiropractors are good at what they do, but the front desk people are literally crooks. They literally steal money. If you want money stolen fro you, go to this place. The owner Shawn or Sean is a true POS and thats an understatement. I wish I had met him a while ago, this situation would have been completely different.< /Text>

<review>Make sure to cancel your monthly plan in person. when I told the receptionist (young Caucasian girl blonde hair) i wanted to cancel, she said ok over the phone and not to worry about anything. Next thing you know my mother's account gets charged 70 dollars hard earned money.  The receptionist lied. When we confronted her she said it's policy to cancel in person. Then why did you tell us you'd cancel our monthly plan, over the phone. STAY AWARE of this everyone. Please give my mother the refund she deserves. We were charged 70 dollars for no service. This receptionist needs to be spoken to by the manager.<//review>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Over the past 5 years, I have dealt with general to severe low back pain, due to a fairly traumatic car accident in college. Over the years, I've tried a number of chiropractors, from the Midwest to Southern California. In doing this, I've spent a large sum of money for highly-rated, expensive, private-practice chiropractors and, frankly was rather skeptical about even trying a chain chiropractor.

In short, I am SO glad I did. I'm absolutely blown away by the amazing, convenient, affordable, and EFFECTIVE treatment that I've received from Dr. Adler and the staff at The Joint on Highland & Wilshire. In all of my personal chiropractic care, I have literally never experienced such immediate result in pain relief - and it's by far, the most affordable.

I'm in for the long run and am so thankful that I can maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular, effective chiropractic without breaking the bank!

Walked in for a quick tour and ended up signing up for a package. The clinic is very clean and has a nice welcoming vibe. It was nice to get an adjustment and consultation all in one day. I was very pleased with my experience with the staff in the front and adjustment with Dr. Adler whom I will be scheduling my adjustments in the future.  The front desk staff are sweet and very helpful. Dr Adler is excellent. He asked questions and listened to my complaints, and was thorough and provided information as to why and what is causing the problems with my neck pain. I recommend you to try this place out for a quick stress relief. This is going to be my first to many visits.<//review>

Been on the lookout for a low-cost chiropractor, and I'm just so happy I found The Joint. I had my first ever chiropractic adjustment with Dr. Adler, he was great and made it as comfortable and quick as possible. He listened to me and answered all my questions. Staff are very friendly and accommodating too. They're open 7 days a week, no appointment required, which is a plus for convenience! I got one of their very affordable membership plans, and will keep coming back.< /Text>

This place is amazing. First of all the parking is great because the lot is so big and living in LA so long it is hard to find parking. I have really bad scoliosis my spine is curved and turned so having a doctor to work with that knows so much means the world to me. I am coming back this Saturday for my second appt. My back already feels 200% better going the first time. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE JOINT. I have been to physical therapy and also acupuncture and this has been the best for me, I recommend for people with scoliosis!!< /review>

I go to make sure I dont have any future problems.  This place is professional, great staff and you cant beat the price.  I go at least 2X per week.

< Review>
I have a very physical demanding job and have been meaning to go to a chiropractor for years.  I've always put it off because I figured they would be too expensive and take too long. This place is the exact opposite. Even as first time patient I was in and out of there within 20 mins, that's with feeling out all the paper work. The staff is very professional and the place is clean. I would highly recommend going to this place.< /Review>

Easy parking, great location, friendly/sincere front staff! Dr. Adler and Dr. Escobar are so friendly. They listened to my concerns and made me feel like an integral part of the process. I felt amazing after my adjustment. My neck and back felt great and I've been achieving greater rotation/flexibility in my yoga practices as a result!< /text>

< Review>
After neck adjustments feel terrible. I came to The Joint because I had a sore muscles on the right side of the neck and shoulders. Dr. Escobar did adjustments on my neck. Immediately after adjustments felt discomfort on my neck  and head. Next day I woke up with the terrible headache , I decided to wait and see maybe it will gone. But the headache still persists even it is been one week. I came back to the office and explained my problem   to the Dr. Escobar he examen my neck very quickly and said you may have a cold symptoms.  After his adjustments I feel pressure on my nose area and headache. I said I don't have a flu, it is happened after I visited you. He ignored me. So I don't know what to do....... Very unprofessional. I don't know what he did to my neck I feel in pain. I am going to go to emergency room.< /Review>

Going to the chiropractor was something I've been putting off for a while now mostly due to the high costs and the hassle of dealing with my insurance. After finding out about this place and how they work I was intrigued to give them a try. After meeting with Dr Lee and Dr Adler I wish I found this place earlier! Great staff, and prices that anyone can afford.<//Text>

Really nice place to have sushi. I really enjoy it. The food was nice, the plates on the moving train was full. The kitchen was working fast. The food tasting good.
But after 5PM the place become crowded so don't wait and come earlier)
Stuff is friendly and nice too)<//Review>

<text>Food was good, place was clean and the staff was friendly.  You can either grab what comes by on the belt or place an order for something specific.  Plates may have 1-3 pieces on them depending  on what it is.  Easy way to try different things with out having to buy a whole roll. Will definitely come back.< /text>< rating>

Kids love this place, where the plates of sushi come around to you.  They also get rewarded with prizes for every 15 plates that you return.< /Review>

This is the best Kura location. I've been to the one in Irvine and the one in San Diego, and this is hands-down the best one to go to. The sushi is always super fresh and they have a great selection of other options if you don't eat sushi. The staff is super friendly and very attentive. And the bathrooms here are very clean and the water from the faucet is always warm. This is my favorite place to go to out of all of the Kura locations!</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

One of the coolest ways to eat sushi on a revolving belt. Food quality is great. Wish there was more main food choices though. Price wise is like $3 per plate. Great place for a party since if you hit certain amount of plates a video plays on the screen and if you put enough you get a toy or something.<//Review>

I have been a regular for years. Service has always been bad and I'm talking about the food preparers. Sometimes it can be 15 minutes to get something when it's not crowded. Also the food peepers do not know about safe food handling. Today a watched a lady right in front of me at the bar handle plates and food and use the same gloves to fix ticket machine and back to food. I will still keep coming but just thought others should know.</review>

<text>What can I say? The sushi goes all the way around the restaurant and you get to choose what you want as you see it. It is really fun for kids as there are mini-games to see how many you can eat, and then you win prizes based on how much you eat. Also it can be a pretty long wait to be seated at some times of the day, but the food and experience is well worth it.</text>< pics>

<text>Very fun place! Not the best sushi I've had, but the atmosphere is great. The food comes quickly when you order specific dishes, or you can ouch the items going by on the conveyor belt. There is a very long wait at peak times, so be prepared.< /text><user_id>117899917183845210708</user_id><rating>4</rating>< Name>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>The rice to fish ratio is about a 2:1, way too much rice for my liking. And although the idea of the revolving sushi bar is awesome and I loved the mix of revolving sushi and made to order sushi, sometimes the items you pulled off of the conveyor belt wasn't the freshest (the crispy rice dish I had was beyond stale). I would go back for the novelty, but there are other places I enjoy eating at more.</Text>< Pics>

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. I love the modern conveyor belt + touch screen ordering combination, and the food is great!
Note to gluten free people, they didn't have the GF soy sauce when we came, you might wanna bring your own.<//Text>

Birthday lunch for my BFF! The costumer service was amazing.Places like this stay in business forever.The Hashim was fresh and they have this sake sampler with different flavors like pineapple et my friend ordered this and I was on a no alcohol diet at the time so I have water with lemon and green tea.All in all a great experience and I will definitely be sure to stop by again when I'm in the T.O area.<//Review>

<Review>I enjoy this place, and the novelty is pretty neat too - it has a good selection, and wide range of tasty sushi... the store itself could us a cleaning now and then, or more often then currently done - but all in all, I would recommend this restaurant.</Review>< Rating>

Keep taking items off the menu that I like. Also, conveyor needs a good steam cleaning!< /review>

<text>Not the best sushi ever, but fresh, tasty and inexpensive. Decent selection, no special rolls though...

So we just sat down, picked a couple of plates and started eating and THEN the server tells us, uh, no Wasabi in the restaurant tonight. Just lost 2 stars< /text></record>

After the remodel, the place is decidedly high-tech, with iPad-driven wait list, menu ordering, automated delivery of ordered dishes, and dish returns at every table. There is a toy dispenser that delivers a toy with every 15th dish returned. The food is the same as before, but the fun factor went way up for the kids!</Review>

You can tell it is from the last night production. Once you step in the restaurant you smell fish although in most of the sushi places you don't only if the fish is fresh! Once you step out you'll need gum to destroy the taste you got in your mouth.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

Food is mediocre. Service is terrible. I was there at 7PM. I had to wait 40 mins to be seated at a booth. Meanwhile they are closing booths at the back of the restaurant. So there are 3 empty booths and I had to wait for customers to finish eating and leave.<//text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>We haven’t been to Kula Revolving Sushi Bar for a while.
They were super busy on a Thursday night for dinner.
Since there were only 2 of us, we got seated pretty quickly at the sushi bar.
You can grab anything that shows up in front of you on the revolving belt.
Or you can order from the iPad.
They often have region specials for a period of time.
These two weeks they have a Kyushu Japan Fair with a few featured items.
Let’s see what we had.

Miso Soup | $2
Goto Bluefin Tuna | $2.25
Spanish Mackerel（Aji) | $2.25
Squid | $2.25
Albacore Ponzu | $2.25
Megumi Octopus | $2.25
Negitoro | $2.25
Ikura (Salmon Roe) | $2.25
Real Crab California Hand Roll | $2.25
Eel Hand Roll | $2.25
Hakata Style Ramen | $4.80

Food was fresh and decent.
It wasn’t the best sushi, but it was budget friendly and fast.</Text>< Pictures>

My wife couldn't even eat her torta, the horchata was undrinkable as well. I have bubble guts. Dont eat here.

If I could give this restaurant negative 5 stars, I would. Everybody was so rude! I returned a carne asada because it was too dried and the lady got so mad at me and started talking about me to the entire kitchen staff. I payed the $ 12 anyways. Never coming back!< /Review>

Food is just as delicious as it used to be just without all of the hustle and bustle. We are really looking forward to when that busy vibe comes back but for now it was so sweet to be able to make a reservation and sit in the park-let and to be able to support you during this crazy time.

Thanks for the delicious meal! (Sam - super nice to meet you and thanks for staying open!)

<rate>4</rate><Text>I want to like this place, but every time I go I find the broths to be flat. Either too fishy (in a boring way, because i like fishy) or a little too bitter and sweet. The other parts of the ramen are great: excellent chasu, some of the best eggs in town, good noodles and generous extra noodle portions. Overall, though, I do not think the bowl of ramen is worth its $20 price because of the broths.<//Text>< pictures>

Had the shoyu ramen and pork and shrimp dumplings and was underwhelmed by both; especially for the price. Not bad but could find numerous better places within just a few blocks<//review>

Literally, the beat ramen I’ve ever had. I’ve been here countless times for years. No where else compares. They make every batch with farm to table local ingredient and a lot of love that you can taste! They also make delicious cocktails.  Sorry, not sorry... this is the Beyoncè of ramen!< /text>

Whenever  I I need a delicious lunch, this is the place that comes instantly to my head. good and all kinds of  food and a large list of dishes.helpful staff members, and good mood. Not less important, the tariff is affordable. I suggest this spot with great pleasure.<//text>

Of all the ramen restaurants in Oakland, the Ramen Shop will offer unique hipster ramen selections. We went on a Sunday afternoon so not peak time so seated right away. Best time to enjoy the food experience. The duck broth shoyu ramen was a bit salty but the radishes were so cute floating in the broth. My dining companion’s Hokkaido ramen was excellent ( a tiny bit spicy). We’ll be back to try the one other and the desserts but probably not the cocktail scene</Text>

Fancy schmancy ramen at your service! Who would have thought that uni butter miso ramen would actually be a thing AND taste incredibly good?! Because I'm a traditionalist and I'm not really about that gourmet ramen life. I don't need all of that extra hoopla; just gimme the noods with the standard basics and I'm all set. HOWEVER.... I will gladly slurp down a bowl of uniquely flavored ramen from the Ramen Shop any day.

This place is pretty close to where I work, but it took me 3 years to finally give them a try. But why, you ask?! Well let's be honest here; I'm not the type to throw down $20+ on a bowl of ramen. The price tag is steep when compared to other ramen spots. But there's a major difference here when compared to those other spots; the ambience and creativity. The ambience here is like no other. I can totally see why people flock to this place. The vibes are amazing and it's a super fun spot for a date night or even just to chill out with friends.

When you first walk in, you'll be met with the sexy front bar and lounge area. It's dark, it's sultry, it glows at night with their huge alcohol display. Me likey, me likey a lot. But, even more amazing is their actual dining area. It's cozy but effective. They've got beautiful decor and lighting with comfy booths, another back bar, and some counter seating with live cooking action. They play some great music back there too. It's just the ultimate chill spot.

And let me just say, those bartenders really know how to throw down in the bar. The cocktails are delicious and perfectly hand crafted. They tend to change up both their drink and ramen menu quite often, so it allows people to explore so many different kinds of concoctions. Speaking of ramen; the ramen here is quite delicious too. They usually have 3 different ramen flavors on deck that can change as frequently as everyday. Their take on ramen is more explorative than anything else.

I didn't know what to expect since I'm such a traditionalist when it comes to ramen, but I was pleasantly surprised. Ended up having a bowl of their uni butter miso ramen and it damn near blew me away. The culmination of flavors just melded perfectly together. The noodles were a lot softer than I'm used to, but the broth really seeped into them and made them very flavorful.

The bartenders, the host, the owner... EVERYONE was so pleasant to interact with. You can tell that they all really enjoy what they do, and they seem to make an excellent team. Not gonna lie, this place is pretty damn pricey for everyday. But for a nice splurgetastic evening, it's totally worth the money. I will definitely be making a return back.<//Text>

<Text>TWENTY PLUS DOLLAR BOWL OF RAMEN. jeez la weez. When I saw the menu (my fault for not checking beforehand) I was shocked. The food here is rather pricey. This is probably a great second date night if you’re looking for a place that has ambiance.

This is also not a traditional ramen place. If you’re looking for authentic tonkatsu ramen, this is not the place. To be fair, I don’t think that’s what they’re trying to be.

The prices are trendy and food is somewhat mediocre. It’s not bad but their ramen was best classifies by our table as “airport ramen.”

The service was friendly but this type of trendy ramen is not a place I would come back to.< /Text>< resp>

Inconspicuous from the outside, stylish and cozy on the inside. They serve three kinds of ramen: duck, veggie and pork. I’ve tried all three and would say pork is the best, followed by duck, then veggie. The bar is really impressive here too.< /review>

The prices seem high at first but once you taste the food it becomes clear how much process goes into making it and the taste is worth the price. Evrdything here is great and liquor selection and cocktails are far above average.  Don't bring your children.< /review>

YOU HAVE TO TRY the to go RAMEN KIT which is Ramen you take and cook yourself at home. You can buy the morning / day before and it is perfect. Cocktails to go are also the perfect way to have an amazing 'date night' at home. (And order this as a side: Lacto-Fermented Sansho Cabbage)

In the kit:
Dashi/poultry broth with house-made noodles (uncooked), pork chashu, seasonal vegetable toppings, and a shoyu-marinated egg.
Packaged cold.</Text>

Always a pleasure, Ramen Shop was delicious yesterday evening. Our crab cake starter was crunchy and delicious. The ramen was great, although I would prefer a brothier broth; theirs is more like a gravy. And the fried rice was superlative. Good service and cocktails.</review>

<Review>Looks like it changes every day so my review might not help you decide what to eat, but no matter what you get it's going to be amazing. The staff is super friendly and accommodating and the entire space is beautifully decorated. A group of 4 split an app and each had ramen that we couldn't finish. Delicious and interesting ingredients that I'm sure I'll never come across again! Definitely worth the wait!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80857dc372123eab:0xb09a84cb2ea24603</Gmap_id><date>1589386390208< /date>< Response>

Awful and expensive... $20 for a bowl of noodles? And it just doesn't taste good. I kid you not when I say a 50 cent pack of Nissin Instant Ramen tastes better than this. Awful Fentimans cola tastes like cough syrup. Won't be eating here again. Honestly, even if the food were free I would not eat this again< /Review>

Good upscale ramen, served in a edgy, non-traditional scene, though the prices might leave you wanting a second bowl at a more affordable ramen spot. The ramen was definitely good. Salty, but flavor laden with the fatty brisket the stock is made with. We enjoyed our bowls, but at $19 a bowl, there are definitely some better deals around. Would have like to try the Tantamen ramen. The rice bowl was well liked by the table.<//Text>

Dark atmosphere with major Oakland-ish hipster vibes. The menu switches up every so often so you never know what to expect. We had a duck-Yuzu ramen which was quite delightful. It was incredibly flavorful and a new experience too!</text>

<rate>4<//rate><text>A bit pricier than other ramen places, could be worth the few extra dollars because of the romantically lit atmosphere. The place is large enough to hold 8 person parties, so that's always a plus. I'd recommend getting the chili paste because finding the bok choy threw me off.

Nice place to take someone on a date. There's also a bar in the next room, so you can grab a drink while you wait for your table.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQ9CP7Y1ceJcS33kuJfLC7dieCmmGtJf6kTywM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80857dc372123eab:0xb09a84cb2ea24603< /gmap_id></record>

Great atmosphere, long waits but definitely worth the wait. Nice bar area while you inevitably wait for an hour + but the food justifies it. Ramen is simple but flavorful and doesn’t leave you feeling too full like many others do. Little pricey but not unexpected for Berkeley.< /text>

<Text>While paying nearly 20 for a bowl of ramen may seem extravagant, believe me it's worth it! The broth is much thicker than say a pho broth and so much more flavorful. They hand make their noodles too. Come early the place is usually full by 6 or 7. Highly recommend this place.<//Text>< Rate>

I adore this place! They prepare fantastic meals, their menu is rich, The cook in that restaurant is a real authority in the kitchen, I like very much eating all their food. The food is always good, the attitude towards the guests  is very good too. I frequently visit this place and I was never discontended. I recommend it to all.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I went there for lunch on a Saturday (I refuse to use the B-word!). Delicious food and helpful, friendly server. I had the green garlic tater tots (tater tots!!). They were made in-house and although they didn’t taste like tater tots that I remember, they were good. The spicy ketchup served with them was delicious too. Not sure the green garlic adds much to that party.

For my entree, I tried the tempura fried maitake mushroom and brown rice donburi.  That was a hearty and very tasty dish. There were things in it that aren’t described on the menu (some black stuff) but I didn’t care because it was delicious. Beets, cucumber, avocado, and of course the crispy crunchy salty maitake. It was very satisfying.

My only wish is that I was hungrier so I could have tried more of their dishes. So many things looked interesting and I would definitely go back and try some other things. Side note: they had an interesting cocktail/beer and wine list as well but I wasn’t drinking that day.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKVr9IhC3WXOI-aVeSQ-GQhNNMj3AE7WP2e426=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT-ZCYVwHpxJxpAdVSg_mLQnSWbIwgQ2dUVjAy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTMcOLlo9lG34CJpAfyLh0tV_lWvbSzdOsON84=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnAB9Nvy18-tBycWS85DeviJqA5TBHJx3xKlOh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlBvGE79X_xap16WeHUPjf9IW1r-SXX7LjGbiI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

No this is a fine ramen culinary experience with a unique ambience to match. We had to wait about thirty minutes for our table which was well worth it. There is a bar area separate from the dining room that makes such waits more palatable. I had the Green Garlic Shio Ramen which was quite frankly amazing, and my girlfriend had the Hokkaido Miso Ramen. We finished up with some delicious desert whose name I can not remember.

Delicious! The ramen menu is simple but the flavors are rich and offer a taste to what you find in Osaka. There's a choice of duck, pork belly or veggie ramen with accompanying garnishes. The noodles are firm and capture the flavors of the broth. They have a well stocked bar with professional mixologists who can conjur anything you could possibly want. I enjoyed the Toki High Ball made with Suntory Toki Whiskey with seltzer and topped with a mint leaf. The coolness of the cocktail paired well with the moderately spicy ramen. If you're a ramen connoisseur, then this is a must visit destination.< /Review>

<review>Ramen Shop is one of my favorite places to go. They have amazing food, (I'd highly recommend the fried rice), great service, and a wonderful atmosphere.
While not a downside, note that they do not take reservations and can fill up quickly, so depending on what time you go, expect a little bit of a wait. They do have a wonderful bar area to sit at while you wait though, so it's not bad at all.< /review><Rating>5< /Rating><response>None<//response><date>1565535242227</date><pictures>None</pictures><gmapID>0x80857dc372123eab:0xb09a84cb2ea24603<//gmapID>< user_id>

I must say this is a hidden gem between Oakland and Berkeley. Felt a little intimidated at first when I first saw the bowl of Donburi but our server gave us tips on how to truly enjoy this Donburi bowl. Black Cod was cooked to perfection - Buttery and moist and the serving size to me is just right. Embellished with different ingredients, there was a fireworks of flavors in your mouth as soon as I tasted it. The Ramen was so rich and flavorful. The Uni Butter made a huge difference making this miso flavored broth even richer. The pork belly was amazingly tender and the thickness was just right. I like the idea that they change up their menu everyday. Makes me feel like I'm exploring another Ramen place every time.< /Text>

I highly recommned this restaurant! I had their ground pork belly ramen and it was unbelievable. Rich delicious broth with a nice amount of vegetables. The design of the place was great with a bar off of one wing and a very cool kitchen sitting just behind some bar seats so you could watch them make the ramen.<//Text>

Can only comment on the vegetarian ramen, which is ok but not very inspired considering the price point. The wait for the food was particularly long, but at least the atmosphere is fun and vibrant.<//Text>

<text>Elevates the category into their own style, both at the noodle and bar counters. Makes everything in-house, from noodle onwards. Strongly recommend when you don't want generic tonkotsu ramen that came out of a food-service package.</text>< user_name>

<Review>On the expensive side, especially if you get an appetizer, but they make the best ramen I've had on this coast. Drinks are good too, and you can get one at the bar right inside while you're waiting to be seated. Be sure to ask for their desert menu; the mochi is to die for.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyAO4QsmwOrkni5SBHM6H5i6HRigcET_98HNyj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqMKEGoKOp5M1cxHEPunWFqAO7lD_9LUDkoNYi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIBSG7KGry-sPCUmSF3YrlXJFmpu39YqusYvh0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<user>103841981973593749462</user><Review>Ramen - kogashi miso ramen.
Tasty, creamy/milky, yummy.

Appetizer - local smoked cod. great tasting cod (wish there was more of it). everything that came with it was just to fill the plate.

It seems like the menu changes daily or week so you may not be able to order the same thing every time you go. The wait was long but they are smart to extend the restaurant by creating a bar as the waiting room.

Also, it's quite pricey for ramen. The service was subpar (-1 star). The hostess on the other hand was on top of her game.< /Review>< Response>

<text>We waited for 40 minutes to be seated, there is a bar where to have a drink in the meantime.

We sat in the bar, we were able to see how the kitchen works, pretty neat.

We ordered Brussels sprouts to start and they were absolutely delicious.

We had ramen and we were blown away with the depth of flavor in the broth.

Service is impeccable, ambience is great, music is on spot.

Overall, great but a little bit overprice, still worth it</text>< name>

<Text>I like the atmosphere and the service was great. However I feel the food was overpriced and just okay not spectacular like all the other reviews promised. We had the pork and shellfish dumplings, duck shoyu ramen, and uni butter ramen. The flavors were good but I found they lack any special distinction from any other ramen shops around the bay area. The duck chashu was decent but compare to Mensho SF (same price $18 ramen) it was just ok......< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80857dc372123eab:0xb09a84cb2ea24603<//Gmap_id><Time>1487549639232< /Time>< Resp>

<review>The Ramen shop is my favorite restaurant within the Berkey Oakland area because it’s so consistent the food is always good the service is always friendly and the waiters and waitresses always make sure that you have an amazing experience not only that they have amazing drink selections as well. If I was anyone or make any suggestion of where to get Ramen close to me and Eastbay the Ramen shop is the number one place I will always recommend<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Very good veggie ramen. It had tomato which I never had before in ramen and I really liked it! The place itself is beautiful but the music is a bit loud and is difficult to talk across the table. Came on a Sunday night around 8 pm and we didn’t have to wait to be seated.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I felt compelled to write a review because I've been coming here for years but the service has really come down. I tend to come after work from BART and offered a seat right away at the bar. This time, I came and a snobby hostess that told me she's worked here for 4 years and it's the rule that I can't sit at the bar right away because my friend hadn't arrived yet. Mind you half the tables were empty and there were ZERO people at the bar. Never once have I been there over the past year or 2 where all the tables were full at this hour. Rules in hospitality and dining should be used at discretion, not for those ready to pay and order right away at a completely empty bar.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Really great, hip atmosphere that is probably good for dates. There is a bar adjacent that serves interesting drinks. The food itself is pretty standard but wayyy overpriced. The ramen is almost $20 and is pretty basic. The Tonkotsu is actually not as good as at many other places. Basically, I probably wouldn't come here for the food, but the environment is worth it.</review>

< Review>
One star based on the terrible dining experience and for ruining our evening.
Flavor wise, it's very good.  Service leaves a lot to be desired.  Our server pretty much abandoned us.  We never got to try the ramen, because our server decided to place our ramen order after our appetizers had been brought to us. This meant an hour later it still wasn't ready.  It wasn't until we inquired that they realized our order was still in the queue.  Meanwhile, everyone that had come after us had gotten theirs.  All we got was an "We understand you're upset, but servers have no control over the orders ahead of yours." Actually, you do. You could have asked us if we wanted our order to be placed all at once.  This should be server etiquette 101.
What a disappointment<//Review>

Gorgeous wood beams, custom bar, aesthetics and the ambiance are cozy and hip. The duck ramen had a nice clear broth, loved the touch of lemon to the mushroom. Perfect! Pricier than some other places but you’re paying for a higher quality place.<//text>

Two tables ordered after us for the same food miraculously got them before us. Excuse me? Did you guys forget us? The receptionist vividly explained what’s the word racist mean as she gave us a contempt look when we walked in but treated others so well. So disappointed. Won’t come back again.</Review>

<Review>I never thought broth could be so particularly good!  As a vegetarian, there's only one option, but it's so amazingly good.  The cocktails are top notch, and the dessert menu changes often and is often very special - great atmosphere,  often difficult to get a table, but easy to get a seat at the bar...  Great for a date night.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I've been here twice. The first time I enjoyed my ramen ok, but I much preferred my friend's ramen. The second time we went here, we ordered the only ramen they had on the menu (I didn't know the menu changes and had come back to order the ramen my friend got from last time). I don't know what the hell they did to the broth, but it was so heavy/fatty. I literally couldn't process it at all and threw it up a couple hours later. It was terrible. And of course it's a very expensive place that makes you wait forever. I will not be be back.< /text>

Sleek restaurant atmosphere but for $20+ per bowl of ramen for lunch, it was average. Noodles were good, but portion was smaller than I’d expect and broth was too salty.< /text>

Different experience between lunch and dinner. The waiting bar is definitely a plus while waiting for your table. The ramen is a hit; hence the long wait time. I’m a bit set back by the hipster price. The bowl of ramen is filled with fresh ingredients- but the amount of ramen you get is not proportioned to the price. Would keep coming back though - not on a regular basis or my pocket will burn. Definitely a sinful pleasure.<//Text>

Have been a fan since they opened.  Only get to visit a couple times a year but it's always sooo good.  One of my fave spots!  Get the veggie ramen and add chashu (a tip a server gave me early on)!<//Text>

<UserId.>116897135206749949855<//UserId.><Review>Waited over 35 minutes for cold do-it-yourself ramen to go. We arrived at 4:55pm, and the restaurant opens at 5, so we were within the first 10 people here. We asked for them to check on our order, which they ignored. I think the ramen is decent if you dine in, but when you're paying over $100 for 4 bowls of cold ramen that you'll need to heat up at home, it should at least be given to you promptly.<//Review><resp>None</resp><Rating>1<//Rating>< username>

This place.... I just can't describe.

I love it, so much. The ambiance is great with just the right amount of dimness and the stereo system is one of the best I've ever heard in a restaurant. The ramen is unbelievable. Daily menu and everything always seems so so fresh.

Y'all, there's a reason this place is on best-of lists across the internet. And that's just for the ramen - I won't even start with the adjoined cocktail bar (which has fantastic signature drinks and very knowledgeable staff etc etc it's amazing just GO already).<//Text>

9/10 - decor and ambiance
8/10 - service
2/10 - ramen

There's a lot to like about this restaurant, but unfortunately ramen isn't one of them, which is pretty disappointing when their name is "Ramen Shop".  This was some of the worst ramen I've ever had.  The noodles were spongey and I didn't think it was possible to make a broth this bland.  It tasted like hot water.  Completely lacking in umami or salt.

Even if this were half the price this would be very bad ramen.  I would really like to see them drastically improve their broth.  It's a shame that such a nice looking restaurant with such good service has this bad of ramen.

Plus side was that their biscuits were amazing.< /Review>

Great authentic ramen restaurant. Great flavors. Excellent service. Unbelievably bar with Japanese liquors and knowledgeable bar tenders. Can't say sanguine bad about this place.

While everything is good, it seems overrated, especially for its pricy menu.  The broth is traditional pork bone based, with an interesting char flavor and ever increasing spicy taste due to gradual melting of the chilli blob.<//review>

Really too hip for it's own good. Way too expensive for what it delivers. Very loud, very dim, and the service is rushed.
The food is interesting, but is too concerned with being cool.
Young people with too much money should enjoy it, I will not return, even if someone else promises to pay.< /Text>

All you have to do is take ramen seriously. That leads to making your own broth and making your own noodles. Adding flavorful well prepared ingredients comes next. Ramen Shop does all of this. Spot on.<//review>

Amazing food, fantastic cocktails, great ambiance, and everyone is really good looking. Try the fried rice; it's like a bowl of crispy flavor bits! The orange creamsicle soda is so fun, and actually worth the price.  The food is expensive, but sourced as ethically and locally as possible, and the quality cannot be beat for ingredients. It's not a casual night out, but it is comfortable and well worth trying.</text>

This is the only place that can charge me $20 for a bowl of ramen and have me be happy about it.

It's that good.<//text>

Pretty expensive and not the kind of ramen house you go to when you're starving and just want comfort food. However, the plates are beautifully done and flavors were delicate and well balanced. Seems like they might have a nice bar program too, but my party wasn't drinking that evening.<//review>

<review>This place is amazing. They dont take reservations and you should expect a wait! Fortunately the bar makes fantastic cocktails. For dinner we had an appetizer and two ramen bowls (one mushroom, one beef) which were delicious. The dessert menu was tempting but we were stuffed. Staff was kind and helpful.

This place is fantastic. Their ramen is very good according to my novice experience but I think it would hold up very well against the eye of a critic. The bar has a great selection of spirits, the staff is both friendly and helpful, and although it's not exactly cheap it's definitely worth it.< /review>

It's the spot for ramen. Great flavor, nice portion size and the best poached eggs ever!!!! They offer a nice cocktail and beer selection too.  Get their early because they don't take reservations and fill up quickly but well worth the wait.</Review>

<Review>It might seem harsh to give 3/5 for a gorgeous restaurant with delicious food... but I have had ramen in LA, SF and Japan and never paid over $16, so to pay $20 for a long wait time and then leave still hungry I just can’t give a 5/5. To clarify the staff was very friendly, but it took way to long to get our food, on a not very busy day.

I got the vegetarian ramen which was rich and flavorful, but only had half an eggs worth of protein and half as many noodles as my boyfriends meat ramen. My boyfriend, another huge ramen fan, was also surprised by how little meat he got for the price. We waited a long time for our food and then $50 later I was still hungry even after drinking all the broth.

Disappointing because I live near by and lovvve ramen. I’m sure we will be back for the bar, but I probably won’t eat dinner there again until the price is adjusted or the food is more filling.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Overpriced hipster food. The flavour profiles are great but it is expensive for a bowl of beef broth and greens. There are other less trendy authentic ramen sites.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
If the Ramen wasn't so expensive (it seems to go up $2 every time I visit) I'd probably eat here weekly. Fantastically cozy atmosphere with tons of wood and low lighting, great service, and rich ramen broth along with a creative drink selection make this one of my local favorites. The full bar/ waiting area is lively and worth getting a drink in if you're waiting for a table, with more upbeat music than the dining area. Some of the other dishes are worth sampling but the Ramen is what brings me back...just be ready to pay $20 for a bowl plus a couple bucks more for chashu, extra egg, or a dumpling add-on. Yum!< /review>

<review>The toasted sesame miso ramen was great. The consistency of this dish was thicker than I expected, closer to a stew, probably from the ground pork in it. Next time, I'll try one of the shoyu options, which my friends also enjoyed.<//review>< GmapID>

Initially, I was disappointed by its consistency, which I perceived as watery, and the lack of depth and richness in its flavor. However, by the end of the bowl, I'd come to appreciate its lightness as it prevented it from being overfilling. And, with the addition of their garlic paste which is ordered separately, the flavor really came together, too. Also, the duck in the dish was amazing! I ordered more. I thought it was similar in flavor to smokey steak.</text>< pictures>

<Text>I live in the neighborhood and never noticed this place.  Went for a walk with a friend and poked out heads in to take a look.  Saw the bar and had to give the bar a try.  Ordered a Cadillac margarita with a shot of mezcal, and the bar tender did an awesome job.  Nice vibe, great drinks.  Hot to go back for the ramen.</Text>< Pictures>

Added bonus: I have a food allergies and I have to carry an epi pen for them, it can be nerve racking to eat out because lots of servers don't understand about cross contamination or the severity of the allergy. Everytime I have gone to the Ramen Shop, the server has been diligent about making sure what my allergies are and telling the staff about them. She even schooled me on something I had no idea about (pink peppercorns are related to the cashew family! Wow.) I appreciate this place so much 💖< /review>< date>

Expensive, but well worth it once in a while. Expect to spend about $100 for two people. The menu is limited, but each item is just right. Staff seems like the perfect Oakland melange for the area and cuisine.</Text>

< Review>
Ramen Shop is one of those controversial places, some people either love it or hate it (for the price). I do have to give credit to Ramen Shop for helping kick off the Ramen Renaissance I feel like we now have in the Bay Area. We have so much more ramen than we did ~8 years ago.

As for the ramen itself, I ordered the duck wasabi ramen. The wasabi butter did not have very much wasabi flavor in it, so I was a bit disappointed. If I go back again, I’d probably order the tonkotsu version, and stick with the classics.<//Review>

Really don't know why this place is so packed? The noodles were fine, not fantastic. Same with broth in my veggie. The veggies were sparse and the eggplant??? Why eggplant? Anycase, someone else must like it cause it's packed, but I'll not return for the cost.<//Review>

So I paid for my unfortunate unpaired glass of white wine and left. We shouldn't have to make our own bowl of ramen at the bar, and the least she could have done is APOLOGIZE and send it back to the kitchen where some inexperienced cook could have actually done their job and realized their mistake. The ramen also only had a tiny sliver of cabbage, the half egg as described, a touch of garnish, and way over concentrated salty broth (add water when keeping at a simmmer ya'll).  What am I paying for again? And is this the what service has come to akin to grocery stores with self-service check-out?  Don't put up and enable this kind of service people, especially if you pay for premium priced ramen!<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80857dc372123eab:0xb09a84cb2ea24603<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Overhyped. I got the toasted sesame ramen for $19 which tasted fine, but didn’t taste like ramen I’ve had in Japan. The soup was thick and nutty/sweet. Got the smoke and mirrors cocktail for $13 and it came in a tiny glass with three giant ice cubes. Didn’t get a buzz at all really - it was like drinking half a cocktail. It tasted great, but for $13 I would expect a full size cocktail. Waitress was friendly but a little slow, forgot to bring me my drink until after food arrived. The atmosphere was fun, music is pretty loud though and it’s pretty dark inside. Overall was disappointed.</Text>

Just good. Nothing special and the ramen is spectacularly overpriced.</Text>

<Text>Can't spot this place from outside because there's no lit sign at night and looks pitch black.  Once you're inside, it's still dark at the bar.  Inside the restaurant part is surprisingly big. Food was pretty good and the poke was good also but donburi should not be served as an appetizer, in my opinion!</Text>< Rate>

This is some of the best ramen I've ever had. It's a little expensive ($18.5 per bowl), but definitely worth it. They also have some great cocktails. I went on a hot day and enjoyed the Susanne Collins, which I can best describe as a mix between a gin and tonic and a mojito.<//Review>

A little pricey for ramen but when you read the ingredients (and taste them) you'll see why... so very worth it. Oh...and the drinks are almost as delicious as the beautiful people slinging them.  This is a great place to refuel after a while in the cool shaded valley of the regional redwoods.< /text>

Apparently the menu changes every day and today they only had one vegetarian ramen and it was pretty gross. Straight soy with a ton of lemon. Not umami.< /Review>

<Review>I love the beer selection here and the atmosphere is fun. Feels like you're in the city. The disadvantage here is that the waits for food can be upwards of an hour or more regularly. The food is good but extremely over priced for what it is and it just really isn't worth the wait. At least not for me.< /Review>< pics>

Yeah, it's hip and pretty good. Plus they have a nice selection of beer and a nice cocktail menu. BUT there ain't no way I'm paying $18+ again for a bowl of ramen again.</text>

Updated to remove one star, mainly because the last 5 or 7 times we had ramen here, I was extremely salty, to a point that we have not come back in about a month (we were weekly regulars). A pity.

Original review: great ramen, hipster audience, usually crowded - we like to visit once per month< /text>

This place is wonderful. Every ramen comes with a broth that is artfully crafted to be a glowing delivery of umami, only to be further enhanced by expertly prepared noodles, veg, and meat (unless you opt for the veg option) bring each dish together for a truly delicious bowl of ramen.

Just eat here.

Oh, and their bar! Great Japanese whiskey selection, tasty cocktails and and very knowledgeable staff.

Drink here, too, if you do that.< /review>

<Review>Ramen ramen ramen. This place had nice appetizers and pretty decent ramen. I had the miso ramen and it was pretty creamy- I’d even go so far as to say that it was hearty. I had a bite of the lemon ramen and, while I didn’t much care for it, my boyfriend loved it. Totally a taste preference. The downside was that it was pretty expensive. For a simple meal for 4 it was over $140. Which seems crazy. I feel like its difficult to justify a $20 + bowl of ramen.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Great ramen, it’s very easy to tell that they put a lot of effort into each and every bowl to ensure its quality. That said, their prices are bonkers, and their online menu on google is incorrect, stating their ramen is 15$, in stark contrast to the 19$ (before tax) hole that one bowl put in my wallet.</Text>< Pictures>

Requires a refined pallet. Presentation is adequate yet the flavor is subtle while the texture remains complex.  Some with limited pallets complain about this location but they have served nothing but high quality ramen dishes as long as I've been going there. One limitation is that when overcrowded the place is uncomfortable to eat in. Otherwise, great place, highly recommend.< /review>

Ramen shop starts with an inviting neat decor- love the wood work and lighting. The food is really well made - light and perfectly fried beignets with miso butter were a surprise on the starters menu, then we had the duck shoyu broth ramen and veggie Meyer lemon shoyu broth. Both ramens were good with a unique take on traditional recipes. The chasui was super tender, noodles seemed fairly standard, soft boiled egg was good. Overall, Ramen Shop is a great spot for lunch or dinner.< /text>

<Review>Just soooo yummy all around, from cocktails to noodle bowls. The ramen noodles are the perfect chewiness and the pork belly miso broth is delicious umami savoriness to the last drop. Tried the fried rice this time and the buckwheat flan for dessert -- both amazing! Service is also great. Absolutely worth the wait and the $$$ for a great meal.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80857dc372123eab:0xb09a84cb2ea24603<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

You're not going to Ramen Shop because the buffet at Cracker Barrel is closed. Go for the best ramen in the Bay, the delicious selection of inspired small plates and the refined cocktails. It can easily set you back $40-50+/person with drinks but you'll leave fully satisfied and thinking about when you will be back. #ramenshop #goearly #noreservations</text>

A little on the pricey side, but completely worth it. They have had different menus every time I've been but they always have creative and delicious options.<//Review>

<username>Christine Chou< /username><Time>1535259195067</Time><rating>2< /rating><review>Finally gave this place a try against my better judgment.  I find myself occasionally indulging in overpriced hipster treats, but the irony of Ramen Shop is too much. It’s not “inventive,” it’s white-washed cluelessness. I had the vegan Meyer lemon ramen - the flavors could be summed up as: salt and a splash of lemon. There was a sprig of arugula, half a root vegetable, and maybe 10 whole noodles. I walked out, one part ashamed and two parts offended, not one bit surprised by the bustling atmosphere of typical Rockridge demographic, if you know what I mean.

I’ll give an added star to my waitress who was pleasant enough.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80857dc372123eab:0xb09a84cb2ea24603</gmapID></record>

Basically, it tastes as though someone has looked at ramen, then tried to replicate it with no prior knowledge of the cooking methods or taste. No subtlety or balance in the flavours, overwhelming amount of oil, and undercooked noodle and rice. To cap it off, service is inattentive and slow. No water or napkins given to us despite asking repeatedly, and we had to flag down a manager to pay our bill. I would give zero star but the portion is large. Go elsewhere.< /review>

< Review>
Terminally hip place, good drinks, but the food is horrid, completely lacking in nuance or flavor balance . Poor choice after poor choice. We couldn't even eat any of the ramen dishes.  To be frank was a bit like pouring aquarium water over spaghetti.  Nothing fresh about it, flavors muddy and unsuccessful.  Fried rice was the only dish close to decent.  Not worth the lines or the cost. Completely baffling and to be avoided  unless you are a little hipster lemming who needs to jump off the cliff with the other little hipster lemmings.< /Review>

Prepare yourself to wait to eat here. They don't take reservations. But they do have a pretty sweet bar in the front area were you can indulge yourself in some unique beers, cocktails, Japanese whiskey, and more.

The broth and ingredients were all so very tasty. The chashu is on the saltier side but it has the fat attached and oh so delicious. The noodles are not your typical ramen noodles. They look more like spaghetti. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the noodles. They didn't have the chewy consistency I like.< /Text>

Very pricey but delicious. Great ramen which changes depending on the available ingredients. Staff are friendly and gracious. Hostess remembered me after one visit. Can be a bit of a wait as people tend to linger. Only drawback can be the Rockridge crowd.<//text>

<Text>Can't fault them for having a long wait. The bar area is nice although it can take a while to get a beer.

The ramen is not traditional, but I don't mind trying different things. Only problem is it was too salty and too small. I love me a big loaded with noodles but I left hungry. And $15 a bowl is a bit steep.

We'll probably come back to try again but I tend to be drawn to Zachary's across the street like a magnet whenever I'm in the neighborhood.<//Text>< pics>

Ramen shop has some of the best chasu I've ever had. The atmosphere is fun and has a good energy. Be prepared to wait, sometimes longer than expected. The ramen is on point although a little on the pricey side. Worth checking out for sure!< /text>

<review>Ramen Shop, you delicious, overpriced, cool, pretentious beauty. This is good ramen, made by a Chez Panisse alum and delivered by an at-times uncaring waif staff. You’ll wait to be seated, but have no fear—there’s a perfectly tasty bar out front.

I can’t imagine a better date spot for ramen, and while the slurping requires confidence, the whole thing can be a weirdly intimate experience. If you’re into that.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Cozy spot, delicious ramen, good service. The bar seating is nice, you get a view of the kitchen and watch them put together the bowls. Only had 1 issue with my meal the 3rd time I went: I got the spicy clam miso ramen, and it had a total of 3 pieces of clam. I was quite disappointed. But it was delicious overall.< /text>

A bit of a fusion ramen experience that you don't see very often. The veggie option surprisingly had one of the best broths they served. I personally prefer more traditionally done ramen and topping, but this side of the bay, that's hard to find.

Definitely on the pricier side for ramen.

Great bar for Japanese whisky.<//Text>

<text>Great raman, but maybe the apps are even better. They did this raw tuna / arugula salad that's amazing. The drink menu is fantastic, with great highballs. But.... I have a hard time with the prices. Better than your standard raman, but two to three times better? hrm...

Somehow the whole is less than the sum of the parts.  I really can't point out why this ramen just isn't that good.  Technically, the ingredients are good quality, and everything is cooked and seasoned well.  But the soup just isn't that pleasurable to eat.  It seems to be missing its umami flavor - you can taste all the individual ingredients, but there is no savoriness tying it all together.  The beef ramen is over-the-top beefy, like gnawing on a bullion cube, to the point that halfway through the bowl it became slightly unpleasant.  The pork ramen is thick and spicy, but it's missing the savoriness you'd expect of a tonkatsu, so for some reason neither of us really cared to finish that bowl, either.  Excellent noodles, though.  This would simply be a mediocre bowl of ramen if we hadn't waited 90 minutes and paid $20 a bowl.  This was our second attempt at this place, and it hasn't improved at all in the past couple years.  With this hype, and these prices, it's not for us.  It's just not that good.< /review>

<Review>Extremely overrated! Disappointed greatly! My ramen was very salty and my husbands was flavorless. Two people, only two bowls of ramen and water and we paid more then $50!! Place was so dim, I could barely see what I was eating. Waitress was almost shocked we didn’t want to get any appetizers.... I would never recommend this place.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
Take away from my "miso ramen" dinner: Tomato soup with noodles... But let's itemize. First, EVERY plate, cup, and bowl had multiple chips revealing the ceramic body underneath and it was obvious that the glaze was flaking off - not enjoyable, and sub par in relation to the price point for their food (being a ceramic buff I was just disappointed that they would even give me chopped dinnerware). Second, the waitress we had didn't even ask if we wanted anything to drink, after she took our order she just walked away - I had to stop her and ask for tea; overall bad start to the dinner but I let it slide and hoped the food was worth it (it wasn't). This brings us to 3 - the food - not only was my "miso ramen" more like the consistency of tomato soup, it had minimal "ground pork belly," which was the main protein of the dish. My partner had the beef ramen and let's just say the amount of depth in either broth - you know, the defining characteristic of good ramen - was about as deep as tomato soup. Mine was WAY too thick, lacking flavor, and didn't taste like ramen at all, hence the quotations. My partner's, while thinner, lacked that rich umami flavor I've come to love from any true ramen. Also, don't get the garlic chili paste - it is neither spicy nor is it flavorful. All and all, the only reason this place got 2 stars was because the waitress seemed genuinely interested in replacing my dish when we asked for the check and I said my food was not really that good. $70 later and I would have preferred to just not even try out this restaurant's take on ramen.< /review>

Great service, bustling live atmosphere. Reason for 4 stars is due to lack of Ramen options for its name and rating. If you are looking for a Ramen resturaunt this doesnt have a huge selection. The ramen is good but not the best Ive had. I live the atmosphere the drinks are pricey but artesian.</text>

That dividing liquid line between tasteless mall ramen and those places with quasi-religious followings you find sprinkled throughout Japan and the South Bay. The broth here reaches a depth I had  never known before.  Every time you sip from your spoon, layers of salty, savory, vegetal and earthy tell complicated, inexpressable stories. This broth takes like the end of a quest. The rest of the restaurant lives up to that insane mythical standard too -- the cocktails are simple and perfect (Japanese whiskey abounds), the atmosphere is cozy and hidden (funny because the place is basically in a mini-mall strip of shops on College Avenue), and the servers are friendly and laid-back. Once tasted, never forgotten.</review>

Best bowl of ramen I've had in the US (edging out Shin Sen Gumi Hakata Ramen). Phenomenal. Rich without being too greasy, perfect bite to the noodles, delicious cured egg to top it off.<//review>

I had the spicy ramen.  For the premium price ($20/bowl), I was expecting a premium product. It fell waaaay short of the mark they set for themselves.  The flavors were ok, if I was expecting a ramen-bolognese bowl - I wasn't. I didn't find any ground pork belly, but I did find a nice sized garlic skin or something incredibly fibrous in my bowl (after chomping on it hard). I informed the server and received a small apology from her alone.

The service was par/subpar as well.  The simple questions we asked were answered, but often seemed to intially puzzle the server.  Maybe she really didn't know if we could remove one ingredient from a dish.

Decor was nice. Lots of unfinished wood work.  People love that. The light bulbs were very, very cool.  A star for the light bulbs alone.

Again, with the price being so high, the margin for error is razor thin.  Razor thin.  And they chose to serve a bowl of speghetti.  I probably should have just ordered some Japanese whiskey and nothing else.  Maybe next time.< /text>

Thoughtful dishes that are well executed and show the diversity that our local food producers provide. Comforting smoked Liberty duck ramen, delicate, soul satisfying, savory and complex. Yuba, she'll beans, delicata squash, duck breast and thigh meat, Shoyu egg and noodles all dance together.  Also loved the rich and creamy uni butter miso ramen. Ground pork belly, Shoyu egg, roasted eggplant layer with more texture and flavor elements made for a unreal ramen. Wishing I lived closer...< /Review>< Pictures>

Veggie shoyu meyer lemon ramen was disappointment. Broth wasn't complex enough but rather just salty. Veggies were more like an afterthoughts: overly saturated with the saltiness of broth. Serving portion is generous. Chashu donburi was not spectacular but just satisfying. Colorful display and taste. Doneness of rice was near perfect and the harmony of ingredients were proportionally correct. Serving portion was again generous. Friendly servers and staff. Busy yet energetic atmosphere and quick services. Price is a bit overpriced.<//Review>

Some of the best Ramen in the Bay Area that you'll find. Ex Chez Panisse chefs go to Jaoan, get schooled and then return with a vision. Such care goes into each bowl here. It's as much a "church" of Ramen here. Also impressive are the wonderful appetizers that change daily. Great salads, sashimi, and chashu dishes.< /text>

Have you always wanted to pay $90 for ramen?  Now you can ;-)

But seriously, this food is great.  We had the pickled mackerel, with turnips, spinach, and mushrooms delicately prepared, and the nettle fried rice for appetizers.  Both were astounding.  Followed with one burnt miso ramen and one veggie ramen.  These noodles did not come the grocery store.  Good list of local beers, and a fancy house-made peppercorn lemonade.

$85 all-in for two.<//Text>

This was the best $9 dollar bowl of ramen I've eaten in forever. Pity I paid $16 dollars for it.

The food is creative (the appetizers more-so than the bowls of ramen) but as I dug spoon and chopsticks into my tantamen, I couldn't help feeling a bit scammed. Someone realized the white folks of Rockridge would pay nearly 20 dollars a bowl for Japanese fast-food, complete with ramen noodle, half an egg, a bit of greenery, some creative toppings that are mostly ala carte and broth.

And as I stared around at a room full of ironic glasses, thrift shop aesthetic purchased at top dollar, and people who cared as much about the length of the craft beer selection (longer than the menu) as about the thickness of their wallet, I say "well done" to the owners of Ramen Shop.

This is exactly the who'd pay for it.< /text>

Ramen wasnt bad, though the selection was somewhat limited. Broth wasn't too oily but could have used some heat, sadly no spicey options or dried peppers to add to it myself. Flavors where rather basic, nothing too special.

For a beer and basic ramen, ended up being about $35 after tip, for one person. Not really worth it to me to come back, I'll spend the money in gas and goto Santa ramen, ramen dojo, underground ramen or katana-ya.

Drink selection is decent though, may come back to sit at the bar and drink some Japanese whiskey. Though those prices are upped a bit much as well, need to pay for the decore somehow I guess :)

I suggest trying it out, but don't let the hour+ wait make you expect amazing things.< /Text>

<response>None<//response><text>Ramen Shop manages to turn ramen into art. Visually, the place is very cool with a bar near the front of the shop. The ramen itself is some of the best the Bay Area has to offer (right up there with Ramen Dojo, Izakaya Sozai, Waraku and Orenchi.)

I went with my friend Al, who's been to Japan times. My favorite all time ramen is still Ippudo in NYC. Totto Ramen is also pretty stellar, but with a lighter broth.

Ramen Shop is very different from all of these places. The focus is on local ingredients you might not even necessarily put in ramen (squash blossoms for example.) The flavors and textures are bold and inspired. It's not meant to be "authentic," just good organic food (since these guys are Alums of Alice Waters resto Chez Panisse.) It succeeds wholeheartedly at that!

We tried a bunch of dishes and drinks. I still think about the Seafood Fried Rice. It's spectacular! The hokkaido miso ramen (ground pork belly, shoyu-marinated egg, corn, pickled carrots, arrowhead cabbage, squash blossom and shungiku) is rich and delicious. The shoyu ramen (chashu, marinated egg, scallions, mizuna, and Mendocino nori) is a little lighter. The pork chashu (porcetta style) is the best I have ever had in a bowl of ramen!

To drink we had the Shop Highball (Hakushu 12-year Japanese Whiskey and soda) and Pimm's Punch (Pimm's, cucumber-infused mezcal, lemon, and ginger beer). I love how they have good Mezcal choices!

Don't skip dessert! The Black Sesame Ice Cream Sandwich is unique and delicious.

Service was attentive and friendly too. Just be prepared for pricing. A bowl of ramen can set you back around $16. I can't wait to go back!</text></record>

No real vegan ramen. Rice in broth is not ramen. Get some non-egg-based noodles and make real vegan ramen—it's not that hard. Don't they realize how many vegans there are in the Bay Area?! Ken Ken gets it.< /review>

Decent ramen, but it's overpriced by about 20%. You're going there for the swank, dimly lit atmosphere.</review>

Ramen traditionalists won't like this place, but the broth is delicious and my service was good. More fusion than Japanese.< /text>

<review>Food wasn't bad and service was friendly, but for 20$ they gave a deli slice  piece of pork and a very small and underwhelming ramen.

Wouldn't have given it a second thought if it was a mall ramen place, but for the price, it was incredibly mediocre.<//review>< pics>

<Date>1621697983472< /Date><rate>5< /rate><Text>When we found this place the rating was 4.4, which is good enough but a lot of the good places around here are 4.6 or higher so I was curious why it had a lower rating. When I looked at their prices my eyes popped out a little and so I figured maybe that's why. We had two bowls of ramen, a salad, one sake drink, and dessert for $90. Ramen is ~$20 a bowl + any extras.

However, this place absolutely deserves a higher rating. The ramen was phenomenal. We both had the Shoyu with the garlic chili paste addon. Noodles were perfect and much better than the ones we recently got at Marafuku, the pork was tender and flavorful with properly rendered fat. Excellent marinated egg with a perfect jelly yolk. The broth was simple and delicious. Despite the price we will absolutely be back for more. The outdoor seating is super cute as well. Oh, and get the mochi rice cake dessert.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) The food is very tasty and excellent service! The only bad thing is that the same workers speak badly about the clients and it was something that I didn't like or think about!

(Translated by Google) The lamen is very tasty and the price is ok. The vegetarian is delicious and sitting close to the kitchen gives you a privileged view of how the dishes are made.
