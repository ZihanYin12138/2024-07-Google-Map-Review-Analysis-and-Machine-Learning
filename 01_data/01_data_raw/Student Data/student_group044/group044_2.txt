<Text>Alvin, Gerry and Stella from Velantro are amazing at customer service and technical support. They were dedicated to answer and solve all of my queries and technical issues. They have the knowledge, expertise and make efforts to help customers. They guided me to get right solutions and plans at affordable price. Establishing a new business with such a great supportive team leads to a good start. So far I am happy with the sound clarity of Velantro. hope it continues. I am happy today :) kudos to Velantro's training and culture.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>We have been using Velantro for over a year now and cannot say more about their service. We had issues several times installing the system and guys are more than helpful. They reach us every time in seconds and help us install. Special thanks to Alvin who helped us last time. We would highly recommend using Velantro for business needs.<//review>< Pics>

<name>Dispatch NLC</name><Text>Great company. Been using them for 8 months. Caller ID, can transfer to the AP on my phone when i step out of the office, choose my phone number, great technical support to help with what you need (hold music, etc), and great staff. When I need something I talk to Stella, and she takes care of what ever I need, but luckily never due to service interruptions.

Velantro has been an awesome company to work with. Our favorite feature is their click-to-call extension for Chrome and Firefox. We have a trucking company and we are making calls all day from a list on the computer so this tool saves us a lot of time. The call quality is great and we even saved money switching from our old company. We had a few setup issues and Velantro was always quick and responsive on the phone. Highly recommended!<//text>

Click to dial options, Great deals, Easy and quick customer support, no problems no issues. Installed all my companies phones within 5-10 minutes. Highly recommend for any businesses out there. Ask for Stella.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Stella and Tigran were a big help to me, they helped me set up my two phones I got for my business. Helped me setup click to dial within 10 minutes, even got my account created. The pricing is incomparable with any other phone service. Would recommend and have referred to my friends out in Texas to get this service applied. It is a nationwide service and honestly worked very well.</Review>

<Review>Phones didn't work, no one answers their emails when your trying to contact them to fix phone lines. I was without office phone lines for 3 days and lost tons of business because of them! then they couldn't even give me my own account number to port my number back!<//Review>< gmapID>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>I have been using Velantro service for 3 of my dental offices for the last 4 years. The service is superb. Tech support is very knowledgable. And the most importantly, its very affordable compared to any other companies. I have 5 lines in each office and i pay less than $120 per month for each office compared to ATT that was charging me 275 for a basic line. Velantro provides unlimited calls and i don't have to pay for separate services like call transfer, call waiting etc... in addition you can simply connect to your other locations by just dialing extension and you are in. Very convenient in all aspects. Keep up the good work guys.</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0fcbecd1511:0xd53d12f08b1e515d< /Gmap_id>< rating>

<text>This system is a lot better than u-verse and AT&T landline combined.  AT&T actually will not fix our underground phone lines, to me this is a right decision at the right time.  Everything velantro promised me all come to be true.  I don't need answering machine anymore. Velantro and Charter is a great combination.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I had my best customer service experience in recent memory at Site for Sore Eyes in downtown Berkeley! Tino was so helpful, knowledgeable, able to answer all my questions, and stayed late after the store closed to help me call my insurance company to make sure I knew all my options for paying for prescription sunglasses. The glasses were ready on time and he was there when I picked them up; he made sure they fit perfectly. I will absolutely be back to do my next eye exam and order contacts/glasses from this location.< /text>

Site For Sore Eyes is absolutely Outstanding!  Yes, they have really cool styles (I found at least 6 pair I Loved - which doesn't ever happen) and every name brand that would make a eyeglass aficionado feel like they won the lottery. But it is the exemplary staff that has won my loyalty - for life. The moment I walked in, Grace's open smile along  with her graciousness immediately made me feel at ease. Ernesto heard my problem as well, and stepped into action, enlisting Tino, the Hero. Tino is an artist with a firm grasp of physics, their expert technician. You see, I wasn't there for eye glasses this time. I had accidentally stepped on my favorite, and yes, chichi expensive sunglasses - and for me, it felt dire; with light colored eyes, I literally cannot see in the sun thus spend $$$$ on good sunglasses. Two other places said: they are not fixable. Tino did the impossible with Grace and Ernesto adding their support. They saved me. 11 Stars***********< /review>

Excellent and easy to access.  One of the things I love about this place is they provide services to low income people in the community through New Eyes for the Needy.  It requires a case manager to access it but once you have that its easy and free for a pair of glasses.   I get my contacts here and have always been impressed with how helpful people are.<//Text>

This store has a great selection of affordable designer frames & friendy service. They may not be high end frames, but the owner stocks good looking, well made frames & keeps up on styles. Not sure why there are negative reviews, buy I had a good experience.< /Review>

I've been going there now for a couple years and I've been happy the biggest thing for me is I can just walk in and they're pretty good about making next day appointments are the same day appointment but keep in mind if you're trying to make an appointment for the same day or if you just walked in you might have to wait a little bit which should be common sense so yes I would recommend this place< /text>

<Review>I am sitting in the office as I type this. I am pissed and trying to hold my composure, I came in Saturday and had a eye exam and picked out my frames. Only after they already billed my insurance and charged me my copay  they informed me the machine to cut my lenses were down. So I was informed to come in today(Monday), I got here at 10am and was told my glasses still isn't ready. The owner assured me the guy who cuts the lenses would be here in 20 minutes. But here I am still waiting a whole your later I will never come here again!!!<//Review>< rating>

I paid for an exam. That went well. I bought a pair of glasses (titanium) which were nice and lightweight. The selling point was when the salesman bent and twisted the glasses and said that the frames were pretty much indestructible. I also took advantage of a "free" frame...I ended up paying about $80 because of the bells and whistles (high index, which they weren't really cause they were really heavy, and darkened so they could be my sunglasses). I purchased the extended warranty on the free pair cause I wasn't sure of the quality of the frames. I did not purchase it for the titanium ones...well, cause they were suppose to be indestructible. Here's why I'm giving it a low rating. Just a few months afterwards, the titanium frames broke, right at the bridge. I came in and asked if they could be replaced...I figured everything (unless they are free) should come with at least a manufacturers warranty (every other optometrist I've purchased frames from has stood behind their products). They said that since I did not purchase the protection on those frames, they couldn't help me. Really? So I went and bought some super glue, and glued the frame at the nose together. They could've tried and helped repair my relatively new glasses, don't you think? Anyway, relatively inexpensive they were; but they failed at customer service.<//Text>

I want to put zero stars but that is not possible so I'm being way too generous already with the one.

I came here only because this gave me the fastest appointment. Now I know why. As soon as I entered I was greeted by a lady whose name is Tyra (something like that) who had a piece of paper that my insurance had faxed her but who did not know how to read it. When I prompted her, she rudely said that she was going to lunch. I waited for an hour for my appointment that was meant to be at 4, which she had recorded as 4.30 - I did not see the optometrist until 5.

The rest of the time I was dealing with this lady and her other colleague known as Grace and yet another colleague known as Andrew. Andrew yapped for a long time about politics instead of taking care of my concerns regarding my insurance. I don't mind a great politics conversation but not when I am at a place to get my eyes checked and under time pressure.

The ONLY redeeming quality about this place is the doctor. He was very painstaking, which can also be taken for as VERY slow. But I left satisfied knowing that he had answered every question I had.

Overall though, save yourself the headache from this place where people lose papers, have no idea how to organize basic things, are constantly blaming you and others. I have never been in a less professional environment. So if you do need to go here because there is no other place that satisfies your needs, be mentally prepared for a lot of incompetence.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I was very pleased with the quality of service and choice of frames at Site for Sore Eyes in Berkeley when I purchased new glasses this past summer.  It was also a great benefit to receive a substantial discount, as I don't have vision insurance.  My husband will be getting his eye exam and new glasses later this month at your store.</review>

What began as a great in-store experience became the worst customer experience I've ever had, to the tune of $400 of mine in their pockets without my purchase nor MY OWN PROPERTY RETURNED TO ME. I ordered a new frame with new lenses, and gave them one of my frames to put in new lenses. They were promised to me by Tuesday, and when they weren't ready and I was flying home for the the holidays, this store sent them in the mail. Their bad, they only insured them for $50, and I never received them. Now they refuse to refund my money, refuse to replace my own property, and I have no transition lenses, and am getting headaches everyday outside, having to choose between sunglasses and no glasses, or my glasses and glaring sun. A woman named Grace who works there was an angel who was very very helpful. Everytime anyone else answers the phone, they say, "the boss is actually quite busy" explaining why he won't talk to me. I filed with the BBB, and the case was closed because this office never responded.<//review>

They will rip you off if you’re not careful.

I came here for an eye exam and to order contacts because I needed a same day Saturday appt and they accept my insurance. The salespeople and optometrist were very nice. The eye exam was reasonably priced I think. But glasses and contacts are a total rip off. I didn’t do my research beforehand because I was in a rush and didn’t remember how much like car shopping a contact lens purchase can be...

First they quoted me $179 to replace the lenses in my glasses. I declined that offer because I know that Warby Parker does that for $50.

Then they charged me $50/box for contacts. I didn’t know how much of a rip off that was until I went home and looked up prices online. I called the store and let them know that I wanted to cancel my order because I found a better deal. Right away they said they could discount my price to $35/box. I took the deal but will just purchase online in the future.

Make sure you negotiate if you purchase anything here. Or just save your money and go to Warby Parker and buy contacts online.< /text>

Sheesh. Over two and a half years ago I bought glasses there. After a year, I got new glasses at another local place. (That should tell you something.)

But here’s the thing: the sight for sore eyes people have been bugging me for 42 months to leave them a review! Unsubscribe? Lol. (Of course I tried that.)

I swear I get the feeling they send so many GD emails to continue the degradation of my eyes.

Anyway, here’s the review: You come in. They help you. You get a obligatory eye exam. You get pressured into upgrading. (God forbid if you opt for contact lenses, lol.) You pay. You get out. You wait three weeks. You get your glasses. You get AT LEAST 42 emails from them to review them. You go through two different sets of eye glasses from a different and better eye glass store. You finally give in. You leave a review. (Feel free to COPY AND PASTE.)

They did their job. I gave them money. They didn’t suck. Two ⭐️ ⭐️...please stop harassing me.

You got your review. I’ll go ahead and Yelp this as well.</Text>

<time>1489852599697<//time><rate>1< /rate><Review>Should have trusted my intuition when looking around the shop. This shop is too sloppy for an eyeglasses shop.  How could them make me look good when they don't look good?

My experience was horrible.  They billed my HSA before the frames came in. Then said the frames are no longer available, but they will not give me a refund but want me to buy a different pair.  They checked my insurance before the eye exam, but now said insurance won't pay and I owe them more money.  I am following up with them and with my insurance based on these unfair practices. If you go there, I hope your experience is better.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Tino, a real optician and mgr at sore eyes helped me find two pairs of enhanced size glasses with poly carb lenses at an exceptionally great value! Although I came in at the end of the day he stayed late to make sure I got my glasses in an hour. His kind service, knowledge and dedication was the best I have seen anywhere in the Bay! They definitely get my business in the future!  Once again thsnk you very much! Sincerely Langston😉<//Text>

< review>
I purchased a pair of glasses and sunglasses during the 2 for 1 sale. I found the person at the shop on Shattuck quite patient as I tried probably 60 pair of glasses- and I found a frame I really liked- of course, it was the ore expensive one at $400 or so and the "free" pair- which I used for sunglasses was from a small shelf across the aisle that looked like a drop off from Goodwill...

The graded bifocal lens I got was clear and I could see more clearly than a cheaper pair I got at costco in a previous year that cut off the bottom half of my perscription.

but, when asked about the "anti glare" coating (so many upsells) I said no- but I did want the scratch proof coating-

now, this pair of glasses (and I am 50 having worn glasses since 4th grade) scratches more easily than any other pair I have ever owned. I brought them back and they claim there was the scratch proof coating- I brought them to UC Berkeley where my daughter is covered and asked them to check- they said most certainly no scratchproof coating- another optomitrist on Solano verified-

but sore eyes will do nothing- they claim it is on there- it most certainly is not as I did not change the way I clean glasses and have worn them for many years. as they are pretty scratched- not big scratches but alot of little ones that makes the lens look like frosted glass in the middle- I can not see to read or do anything that requires focus-

so- they are a great low cost place but with add ons and such- you are better off going to someone who backs their product- I will not purchase from them again given the state of my glasses 5 months later ...</review>

Worst experience ever!!
Worst customer service!!
I wouldn't recommend this shop to my enemy!

i bought prescribed eye glasses for computer purposes. And I was not comfortable with the glasses they gave me so I went to my doctor to check what was wrong and he said the glasses are not made as per the prescription. Then I went back to them and told them that the eyeglasses are not made as to the prescription and I wanted a redo. Surprisingly they asked me to pay again for the redo even though it is they who messed my eye glasses up. And they lied to me that blue light coding was added in to my glasses but when my doctor checked it there was none.

I wouldn't recommend this shop to my enemy.< /Text>

DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS BUSINESS. Very sloppy, rude customer service. Cheap AND dishonest.

I bought glasses here that came with a scratch on one of the lenses. I went in to pick up my glasses and they could not find the glasses at all.  After looking for 10 minutes or so they finally found them, with the scratch. The owner (Paul) told me he would immediately order a new lense but that I could take them away to use in the meanwhile. But apparently he forgot all about it and forgot to note the date I picked up the glasses in their records or that their was a defect they were going to fix...

.... One year later still waiting for them to replace my lense. I finally went in to get the lense replaced. The owner denies ever telling me that he would replace the lense but now says that if I BUY one new lense (at full cost) he will replace the defective lense. He basically said I was making it all up and blaming me for not insisting that they do what they were supposed to do-- order me a new lense and then call me when it was ready.

In addition, they refuse now to honor the one year scratch warranty. I originally ordered the lenses a year ago on October 5. I picked them up a couple of weeks later.  But they did not give me any paperwork on the pick up and now because the owner neglected to make a note in their records that I had even picked up the glasses they are claiming October 5 warranty expiration.

These people are cheap, rude, sloppy and dishonest.</Review>

<Review>These guys are the worst.  They broke a pair of glasses and then charged me for the frames.  THEY BROKE THEM AND CHARGED ME!  If you are stupid enough to go here, don't give them your credit card.  Pay in cash, wear a disguise and give a false name.  Seriously, fraudulent.<//Review>< userid>

The food was ok, I order the frittata but really nothing I cannot make at home. In the other hand my daughter order the french toast and hoooo boy! a huge plate of delicious toast with strawberries! Hopefully is so big I can manage to eat a whole toast!!

The staff was friendly, our server was Nataliia and she was nice!

According to my frittata breakfast was meh and over price, according to the french toast, breakfast was sooooo good!<//Review>< Pictures>

Delicious happy hour items. The garlic buttered escargot snails on flat bread are delightful with the included salad, and the house Cabernet and beers of the day are great! The calamari fritti and chicken shawarma are both a awesome deal as well.<//text>

I ordered take away. The guy that took my order was nice and helpful, but when I came back to pick up my order a person with a heavy French accent had some attitude and was rude. The quiche had a soggy bottom. The tart was standard store bought with little flavor. Croissant was old, soggy and the filling had a  granulated texture that lacked in flavor. The salad was basically a opened bag of spring mix with couple slices of cucumber and tomato with a few crumbles of goat cheese. There was a goat cheese filled flaky pastry item that was great that came with the salad. Just a bad experience for the most part<//review>

Amazing food and service! The owner is very friendly and everything on the menu that we tried was fresh and delicious and very clean. Every single part of the salad was perfect, late was so smooth and the French onion soup is the best I’ve ever had, anywhere!</Review>

Delicious food, great service, patio dining with heat during covid. We happened upon this inviting little patio because of the fire... It was early for dinner but we were hungry and happy to try a new place. We enjoyed the escargot🐌, the wine 🍷, the salmon 🐟, and the mussels! The server was lovely. Oh and we also had a lovely layered chocolate and coffee dessert... We will be back!<//Review>

<Review>Came here after a 2.5 hour hike, so we were famished. Got seated immediately as it wasn't crowded at all for a Sunday afternoon. We ordered the croissant, iced latte, white mocha and the egg florentine and spinach and goat cheese quiche with french fries.

The croissant was soft and tasty. My boyfriend thought it was not flaky enough, but I love the soft, non-flaky croissants that don't fall apart after a bite, so I was happy.

The iced latte was a bit too iced and not very interesting. However, the white mocha was very well made - enough sweetness for someone like me who puts 3 sugars in her coffee and also enough bitterness for my boyfriend who puts no sugar in his.

The florentine was tasty enough. I particularly do not enjoy the runny yolk, but the bread was well made and the whole thing worked. The potatoes were lovely. The fruits on the side made for a refreshing meal.

The quiche was ok. I could not taste the goat cheese until the very last bite. I guess it was like every other spinach and goat cheese quiche. The salad accompanying was delicious! (I am not a salad person at all). Since I'd asked for french fries and they served the salad by mistake, they also served the french fries, which were also delicious - thin, hot and not very salty.

All in all, the meal was very filling, the owner was very nice. However, not sure that the food was extra-ordinary.< /Review>< pics>

By far a local favourite, Cote D'Azur provides a warm, welcoming environment along with delicious food. Sitting in the bistro sipping a cappucino is a routine of mine and something that is well worth the expense.

I highly recommend their freshly baked Almond Croissants or any of their house-made desserts.< /review>

I did return to Cote D’Azure for another try. The food was excellent and the Customer Service was friendly, and very accommodating! The issues I had listed in my prior negative review were all corrected now! As I had hoped, this again will be a favorite neighborhood cafe for me!
Thank you

The new owner, responded appropriately to my Prior poor customer service review. I know these are hard times for everyone, but it is especially important now to offer excellent customer service. Since the food here has always been good as well as the friendly serving staff, I will give Cote D’Azurr  another Chance and hopefully it will again become a favorite of mine moving forward.< /Text>

{'time': 1597440334051, 'text': 'Hi Susan, thank  you for your message. We are sorry that you get a bad experience. The conditions are still the same as the previous owner. A mistake have been done because we charge $0,60 for Soy, Almond and Coconut Milk. Concerning the entree, there can be a charge for extra sauce home made. All our customers is important for us and again, we are sorry that you get a bad experience. Our croissant is still made with good product and cook every day. Feel free to come whenever you want to have a free croissant and free coffee.\nThank you,\nNatacha'}</response>

I love this restaurant! They give superb meals, their menu is decent, The chef in that spot is well trained, I love a lot trying all their food. The dishes are always fresh, the attitude towards the visitors  is very good too. I often eat in this place and I not even once was disappointed. Highly recommended.<//Text>

<Text>My wife and I stopped here for a weekday brunch and the food was delicious. She had the frittata and I had the California Benedict. Both were quite yummy. Our espressos and food took awhile to be delivered, but the wait was worth it. We weren't in a rush and enjoyed our conversation and fine brunch.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Review>This restaurant is truly a hidden gem! The food and service are great with lots of options for breakfast, lunch, dinner...and DESSERT! Whatever you do, do not skip trying the homemade pastries! They are to die for and better than anything I had in Paris. Try the tarte aux pommes (apple tart) or tarte aux poires (pear tart). You can taste the love put into all the dishes. This restaurant is also a great spot for Sunday brunch. Overall, I highly recommend it.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I love this place! Such a cute little walk thru the succulents. I love to see the lizards skitter away and once I did see a snake right near the path. So glad that someone has been cleaning up the planted areas. Wish folks wouldn't smoke there as that seems so counter intuitive to me.<//Text>

Decent park showcasing the Oakland Hills fire. It's more a memorial than a park.< /Text>

<Text>Interesting memorial with the history of the fires in the East Bay hills, as well as important info on how to prevent it in the future. Also a good meeting spot for people looking to challenge themselves on a ride up Tunnel Road. There's even a water fountain to top up your bottle!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This place is absolutely wonderful. The gentlemen working there are all very professional. I had an issue with my sensor and they took care of it. The one who helped me listened to my concerns and even offered us (my children and I) to wait in the waiting room. Chairs were separated with a good distance to maintain the social distance. Thankfully it was just us three there so we didn't have to worry. I would absolutely go back there.< /text>

<Review>I went in to ask why my transmission wasn't shifting and they told me I just needed four new tires 😑. I spent almost $500 and found out the next day that the tires were not the problem. You will have a long wait because they are always busy. There's a jack in the box across the street, though, so that's nice.<//Review>< Pics>

<time>1616191981286< /time><review>On 2/11/2021 at around 10:30 am. I walked in hoping to buy a set of four tires. I really wanted good tires and expected to pay more for quality tires and faster service. A sales technician with the name of Emmett (Sorry for the spelling) assisted me. I asked for Michelin tires and he told me that I was looking into 1000 dollars for all four tires. I said under my breath
"oh man and Costco does it for 700". I know Costco does it for cheaper because of their sales and I expected to pay more at a specialty place like Big O Tires. What I didn't expect was Emmett's reaction. For lack of better words, he went off on me. He told me "Seems like you already made up your mind. We can't compete with Costco. Maybe they are giving you an older model, the ones we have come with 80,000 mile warranty".. and much more. After he was done ranting, I asked him why didn't he start with the fact that the tires come with such great warranty and they were a newer model? He went off on me again. He told me " No, I didn't have to begin with anything, you already made up your mind, its not my job to convince you, etc". I began to walk out the door and in the process I told him that he needs to work on his customer service skills. His response was "its the way I am".
Maybe I was wrong to bring up the Costco price but maybe if his attitude would have been more positive, maybe I would have splurged the money and gotten my tires there. I was willing to skip lines, wait time and the hassle, I was already there. If Emmett would have said something along the lines of "You know they might be more expensive here but you get new model tires, 80,000 warranty, and we can have it done for you in one hour or two" I probably would have said, lets do it. Too bad for Big O tires, they lost a loyal a customer due to this individual and I hope other customers never have to experience what I did.
I ended up getting my tires at a nearby shop and spent as much as I would have at Big O Tires. The difference? A sales technician who actually cared to sell me a set of 4 Michelin Tires.</review></record>

Thank you so much,  The team really understands the customer. My experience is positive and both the manager and staff share my concerns and financial  situation.

Thank you so much.<//Text>

I would never come here if your a single woman or from out-of-state. I came to the shop early Saturday morning for an oil change and possible  front brakes. They only had one car in the beys. All of the technicians were leaned up against equipment not working. The customer service guy saw me walk in and an older hispanic guy behind me. He completely ignored me and went straight to the other guy. I waited about 10 minutes listening to them talk in Spanish before I left. I came back about 10 minutes later same scenario different customer. I had my non expired coupon for the oil change at $49.99. The CSR finally called me to the counter. I explained what I wanted. He took down my information and went outside to check my mileage. He came back in and quoted me a price of $138 for the oil change before all of the additional fees. He claimed that my truck took an extra quart of oil that was going to cost me $20 extra, the coupon for that store expired yesterday despite the print and because I was from Nevada an extra charge was added. Totalling everything to about $178 for an oil change. The wait time would be almost 2 hours because the guys are very busy and the rest of the crew hasn't came to work yet. I explained that I have never paid more than $65 for an oil change ever. I was told to go back to Nevada where it's cheaper. Not knowing that I am born and raised here in Long Beach. As you should know they didn't get my service. I got it done at a great price, no additional quart charges (assumptions make fools out of people. I have a small 3.6L engine not the HEMI) and was straight forward in what I needed. I would never reccomend this establishment to single women or out-of-state travelers. They will try to cheat you.</text>

Stay far, far away from this place. I went in for one service & was trying to be up sold on a repair. Asked what the price on part & labor. Price on part was 4x the cost. I declined the repair & they attempted to charge me a  inspection fee without consent. They had my car half the day without a phone call. Manager was also a total jerk.< /review>

Had an 8 AM appointment, shop was not prepared to service an 8 AM appointment.
5 or 6 cars needed to be moved out of all the service bays prior to my appointment, 25 minutes later at 8:25 they were prepared.
I will never go back as Salvador Garibay the opener does not prepare and does not care about wasting my customers time.< /Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Pics>None<//Pics><Text>Horrible customer service! Do NOT go here. If you go, ask questions and inquire BEFORE paying for any service they will turn you away with their treatment just for asking questions. I sent my partner to get a tire change, 2 tires and possibly front breaks. We didn't end up getting any services. Sal was very rude when i was asking him for the total cost and about the over $100 charge for labor on 2 brake pads, he began to get defensive and told me that i can "go somewhere else for my services" he also had someone to go to my partner and ask her to leave the location because she was "taking up space and not getting serviced." They are still struggling with their customer service, looking at all reviews, they have been for a while and something needs to change.< /Text><name>Honey Thomas</name><resp>{'time': 1606225107147, 'text': 'Hi Thomas customer satisfaction is important to us.

I made an appointment.  I arrived on time.  Within 3 minutes after I gave my keys to the service manager, my car was on the lift and being serviced.  This impressed me especially since the shop appeared to be filled to capacity.  I was very pleased at how fast my car was serviced which included the installation of 2 new tires and tire rotation.  This is the 2nd time that I have purchased tires from this shop.   I  appreciate the level of service which includes a very reasonable price for the tires.  I complimented the service manager and told him that I go out of way to come to this shop to do business.<//Text>< pictures>

Emmet is always extremely helpful, professional, courteous and gets me out of there quickly.  They are no-nonsense, tell me what I need now and what can wait and don't  inflate the bill with things I don't need but rather give me options and costs up front. Highly recommend!<//text>

Not only they have reasonable rates, they care about their customers.
The Big O tire guy was acting like he is doing me a big favor by taking all my info, charge a $25 bill for a flat tire and asking me to wait for 1-2 hours.
Big chains like these don’t care. But small businesses like these are awesome.

Went in to do a simple leaky tire patch.  It cost $25. There was a 3 hour wait, but if you go in the morning, it shouldn't be bad. They at least gave me an accurate time estimate.

TERRIBLE customer service. When I called I was placed on hold for 5 minutes and I hung up and called back and he told me he had 3 people in front of him and 2 people on hold. So I hung up. Apparently one 1 person works there. So I finally was able to make an appointment for today. I went in and the gentleman sitting there was on the phone. Didn't acknowledge me at all. Not a smile, not even eye contact. Then another man walked in and said he'll be right with me. He continued to do paperwork and walk around working. Phone rang and he went AND TOOK THE CALL!!! I was placed on hold when someone was standing there but when I was standing there he took a new call. I walked out I don't have time for bad customer service. I'll find a place that wants my business.</text>

Had a super awkward experience a short while ago. I completed the survey they e-mailed me. In the survey, I made sure to let them know about my poor customer experience, specifically with Javier. So, what happens? I get a call from Javier to complain about my feedback. What company does that? Either the complaint went to him directly and he won't do anything about it or corporate sent the feedback to him and had him call me? So odd and awkward. In any case, the customer service here is weak. I've gone to other Big O stores and have had more pleasant experiences. Javier looked annoyed every time I had a question. He took a tone with me when I inquired about the status of my vehicle since it was taking longer than expected. Cold personality. The two times I've been here, they have one person working the desk. Wish I could get my money back. I don't recommend going to this specific location.< /Text>

<review>I sent my wife to do a oil change with a coupon that we got in the mail. We were happy to save some money. But when she got to her appointment the guy at the counter told her its not going to be 30 dollars with the happy car service it was $55.00 because it was a full synthetic oil they put on my car a Nissan sentra 2013. I wanted conventional oil I don't care what the recommendation is. its just a RECOMMENDATION not required. very upset then they disrespected her by being so rude about the things the car needed done in service they just blew her off. I am not coming here.< /review>< pics>

”Javier” who works at the desk and answers calls has the worst customer service I’ve encountered. Called the store to ask a few questions about my AC blower motor that was fixed at big o tires and broke in 5 months.

I called to ask about warranty on the AC and got the response saying they needed to see the invoice. I explained that I had the invoice in front of me and if there’s anyway to find out over the phone because I live far away.

The entire time I got responses from “Javier”  that made me feel like he didn’t want to waste his time on the phone, instead giving me short answers so I could hang up and he can go back to what he was doing.

Terrible customer service before I started doing business with them. Can’t expect anything better if I were to do business with them.</review>

Had an issue with the wife’s car. Went in, they didn’t even chk it. Said I would have to replace the oil pan. When all I wanted was to get a really bad striped bolt out. Went to a local smaller shop. They were able to extract it and did the oil change for me as-well for dead cheap.</Text>

They were okay. The staff were nice and I didn't have an appointment so I had to wait 3 hours. I just wish they would have told me about how long I would have to wait bc I would've left and then went back. I had to reschedule an appointment that I would have not been able to get in today. I got lucky and she just happened to have a cancellation. Super long wait without pertinent updates. I was able to use a coupon which saved me a lot of money.</text>

This Place was horrible. i went in for a break inspection and they ended charging me almost $700 for basic parts that could be bought at auto zone for a fraction of the price. the took machine screws off my center caps and dint replace them. when i went to get my vehicle one of the technicians asked the cashier if he told me about the small leak in Spanish and the cashier said "no, its fine."  i come later to find out that i was leaking a large amount of break fluid. THANKS guys!!!< /Text>

<Date>1448497885381< /Date><review>This review is long overdue.  I received an oil change about 4 weeks ago based on an oil change special for $19.99.  After looking at a few fairly bad reviews, I was slightly skeptical about going to this location.  However, I frequented the NTB Tire and Auto Center in Atlanta, which is apparently one of their sister stations-- plus they were close to me--- and an oil change is fairly basic, so I figured I would check them out anyhow.  I must say, they did not let me down.  They had great customer service from the time I walked in and talked with the guy behind the counter to the mechanics and everyone in between.  All were very nice, courteous, and respectful.  They finished the job extremely fast.  Showed me specific problems that needed to be fixed and how soon. The head mechanic even replaced a light bulb on the rear of my vehicle, that unfortunately had been out for some time, for free.  The work/service was good.  Car performed well afterwards. No hassle. Easy breezy. Great price!</review>< username>

Waited at 8 am opening time behind several other customers.  I had a rim and a tire to mount on it. All I needed was the tire mounted.  They told me 2 hour wait time  at least.   I went down the road a half mile and had the job done in 10 minutes for 10 bucks.   They didn't seem to care about my business or the fact I was traveling and needed some quick simple help.  I wouldn't go there for anything after this.< /text>

Went there and had 2 tires replaced.  After getting home my tire pressure sensor on the dash said that I needed to have the sensor serviced. Before going there everything was working fine. When they checked the tires they said one of the sensors was missing, which just so happened to be on the tire they replaced. I said so where do we go from here. How do we fix this. I was told that they could order me another one. I told them that we shouldn't have to pay for another one since everything was there until we got our tire changed. His response was that they dont remove tire sensors. I told him everything was fine until we went there. And we argued back and forth for a while.
I will never ever be going back there again. The person who changed the tire either knocked it off and they lost it or it was stolen. Worst customer service as well</Review>

The company seems well organized, prices are reasonable, and great service seems to be a standard. My experience was not pleasant at this store.  I would not go here again and cannot recommend this location because of one man's choice to be dishonest.</Review>

Do not bring a classic car here! I brought my 1960 ford ranchero here a few days ago, I drove my car on the freeway and noticed a strange noise. I decided to lift my car and inspect it, this being a unibody car a dent in the floor can throw off the alignment since all of the weight of the car is supported through the body and floor of the car. I found that the mechanic disregarded what I told him about how to lift my car. I told him that he must lift at the pumpkin and support the car with Jack stands at the rear subframe between the torque boxes and the mount of the leaf springs in order for the rear end to drop. I have taken my tires off many times without damaging my car this way. He decided to put the Jack stands under the rear floorpans and smashed the sheet metal floor supports and put some large dents in my floor. I called them and got a bunch of excuses and bs. I built this whole car, don't try to bs me! This is not going to be easy to fix, not cool.< /Text>

<text>On Feb 21, 2015, I purchased 4 new tires at the location at 9075 Artesia Blvd, Bellflower, CA. I also purchased, according to my receipt a "Tire Protection Policy" for $84, under which the receipt says "3 YR ROAD HAZARD WARRANT, 3 YR WORKMANSHIP WARRANTY, 3 YR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, LIFTIME PRORATED REPLACEMENT, FREE ROTATION/REBALANCE, LIMITED MILEAGE WARRANTY". I was told that the tire were prorated to 50,000 miles, and if they wore out before then I'd get a percentage back. That location has shut down, and I have since used the location at 1181 E Pacific Coast Hwy, Long Beach, CA. Last week, when I tried to get my tires rotated, the technician told me that two of my tires (which only have 21,000 miles on them) were too worn down and that it would do no good to rotate, and that I should purchase new ones. I asked the manager what the prorated warranty on the old tires covered, and he said what I currently have weren't covered by warranty because they are "performance tires" and don't list a mileage number "at the top of the receipt". He was also confrontational and rude about me even asking. So what did that tire protection policy cover? My whole family always buys from Big O, but after this, I think maybe we should be looking for a tire retailer that is not actively trying to screw us over.</text><user_id>106470772582367223801<//user_id></record>

I tried to give this place a second shot because I had a coupon. The guy told me was going to cost $75 for an oil change after I had a coupon for $17.99. What kind of s*** is this place trying to pull? I would suggest going anywhere else other than this place!< /review>

I came here after a long road trip and did regular maintenance and checks like oil change, tire rotate and balance, alignment, etc. Store associate called me to tell me some recommendations on top of what I came in for--which is fine--except one of those recommendations was that my back tail light was out. I said no thanks to all the recommendations bc I only wanted to get done exactly what I came in for. Later that night, after I had gotten my car back, I went to O'Reilly's and told them I needed a bulb for my back tail light (because it's cheaper there.) I didn't know which one was out so the store associate came outside with me and stood behind my car while I had it on and was pressing the brake pedals. He said none of them were out. So lesson learned kids...Big-O-Tires Long Beach lies.</text>

Do not get your car serviced here! I went in to get new tires and an oil change and then about a month later my car was out of oil. I returned and did a synthetic oil change thinking maybe I put too many miles on it and then another month later my car was shaking and feeling like it was going to shut off mid drive. I checked the oil and again and there was not even a drop left! I paid $79 for a synthetic oil change and they literally didn't do anything. I got a friend to do an oil change and   another surprise found out that they never even changed the filter,it was the original one my friend put on about 4 months ago!! They took it off and retightned it so tight it was almost impossible to take off. Total RIP off and very expensive for a waste of time and money.< /text>

<Review>They are intelligent because they are very polite individuals which makes them appear concerned.
But they claim things about the car that are simply not true
Why?
I can only assume they want to charge you more $$$$$$$
I was told a few ridiculous things
FIRST THINGS FIRST.........WHENEVER YOU ARE  TOLD THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH YOUR VEHICLE ALWAYS GET A SECOND OPINION
WHY?
Because you can compare prices on service and figure out if Big O Tires is a Big O Lie

Ok so I found a coupon online for discount oil change I called their number and was told to come in the mornings because it less busy
I followed the direction

The next day shortly after arrival and as soon the cars hood was popped open I was told that I had coolent mixing with my oil

I was a little amazed that the service provider could see that without inspection he must have X-ray vision to see into the engine -Amazing!

Then another service provider claimed that my oil cap was faulty
And they would not change the oil because of my supposed issue with coolent and oil mixture

I said ok

But then he said "we will do it but we shouldn't and the car will break down soon"

They changed my oil charged me the $24 and I went on my way

My father is a mechanic so on the drive home I called him and express the supposed issue
He educated me to get a second opinion but to look at the coolent to see if it needed Antifreeze or water

It was not low and after driving to a mechanic that offered free inspection the mechanic asked me where I was told this ridiculous information I said Big O Tires
He said can you imagine how many people fall for this kind of bullsh*t

So please don't get distracted by their kindness and politeness and Always get a second opinion

Oh the place that offered the free inspection is Mikes auto repair on Atlantic

<review>Horror of a place ! I did a phone order. Went to the pick up desk inside. A person standing up at the pickup desk told me order is ready. But asked me to wait in line to pay - same line as in store orders- even though they had a payment register right at the phone order pick up desk. After waiting in the in store line for 10mins - they were still confused about my pick up order.

After all the confusion they still messed up my order and had to come back into the store to pick up. I short, this place is run  by confused employees.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fc7556c3e56ab:0xf293f5b6ec20d906</Gmap_id></record>

<review>Appears to be courteous and hardworking staff. They were busy when I arrived for pickup so my order was maybe an extra 15min, 30+ in total wait time from placing through Google maps. But when I got home to enjoy the sandwiches and wraps everything was good as expected<//review></record>

<review>Ordered a salad online. Had it delivered to my work. They sent me a wrap instead.when I called they were less than helpful.

I had my company order over 12 Turkey avocado sandwiches for our workers the other day and half of them had no meat and some with maybe a piece of meat or two.. ridiculous! Over $100 worth of food and they ripped us off that's how you get reported to the better business bureau. Robbery<//Review>

I've been coming here for years now but there seems to have been a recent change in management.(I'm thinking buyout) They brought in new vendors for the food and they've taken their costumer service up a notch. The employees seem happier and more coordinated.  Everything tastes fresher and bread is a lot softer. It's a noticeable difference in quality.< /Text>

Never been to a Togo's. Did not know you just walk up to any counter and order. No lines. Would have like somebody behind the counter to at least acknowledge I was standing there looking lost. A " I will be right with you." would have helped.<//text>

This is my local Togo's. They make a fair sandwich, but the service there makes me give them a lower score. I've literally ran into only one person in a decent mood since I've been going there (almost three years.) I can get a sandwich anywhere, I would really prefer to get it somewhere that isn't such a downer every time I'm there.<//review>

I love Togo's, generally eat it twice a week.  This location as well as the one on Osgood are terrible.  Extremely rude, and always manage to get the order wrong.  Ingredients do not seem as fresh as other locations, and each time I have given these locations another try(5+ times) I end up throwing away half my meal.  Time to find a new sandwich shop to frequent.</Review>

Avoid this Togo's if you can. Easily the worst service of any Togo's I've ever been to. The employees couldn't care less about anything. Extremely slow and rude. To top it off, there was hair in one of our sandwiches. Never coming here again.< /review>

I walk in at 740pm monday and employee just stared at me. As i wait in line he stared and said nothing. He had head sets on ignoring me. Then they argued on who's going to give me service. After I got my sandwich it is a mess it looks nasty as if it was drop then pick it up and put it together. Forget this place but its the only one open late. There better togos around with better service.</Text>

My group and I were the only customers in there. Two workers looked at us from the back when we came in and then one worker came out to greet us after a couple minutes. Then he proceeded to fill up the condiments before he helped us. It took 28 minutes for him to make our four sandwiches and get us  out the door. Ridiculous.< /review>

<text>I managed a Togo's for almost 3 years so began with trying to call in order for pick up. Called three times all which I hung up after 90 sec ringing no answer. So I show up and I'm first in line with a order of two 6 in sandwichs both cold and simple order too. It took this kid literally 19 min . And did I mention that the phone while I was waiting for my 10 min long process of sandwich was being made and thought at this time the shift lead was helping a customer she still ignored the phone . And it wasn't till which I assume the owner of the store came in did the shift leader finally answer the phone! SMH. Now the cake topper . When I was trying to drive back to work with 5 min left of my lunch I take a bit and literally I got bread mayo 4 pieces of thin salami two slices of cheese and he forgot the turkey! I sat there and instructed each item to be put onto the the white roll! Wow SmH! I was furious .I called store and they say they took down my name and number to receive a free sandwiche next time I came in . Lol it's been two weeks and I just don't have time to deal with such incompetence. If u r in hurry or like to receive what u ordered this is not the Togo's to go in Newark . Castro valley and bayfair as well as one on Hesperian near A st r great though!<//text>< Gmap_id>

<review>We placed an online order for quick pick-up, but they didn't start making our sandwiches until we arrived, sort of defeating the purpose of pre-ordering. It was about 8pm, and they took about 30 minutes to make three simple sandwiches that did not have custom mods. ingredients were sloppily strewn about the counter where they make sandwiches, and  they had to run back and forth from the back room to get basic ingredients like lettuce and tomatoes. It's 8pm on a saturday and I'm sitting there thinking "is this the first sandwich you've made today?" A friend of mine mentioned that he had chosen wheat bread, and the owner snapped at him "if it doesnt say it on the receipt we serve white bread." Sure enough, wheat bread was on the receipt. Overall a terrible experience for what should have been a simple sandwich pick-up. Do not go here.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I like TOGO's, usually, but this was not really a TOGO's. At least I hope so because the people running this place seem to want it closed. They didn't know how to make a wrap, they ran out of bread. The person in front of me asked for a meatball sandwich and was told they had run out, then 5 minutes later as they were making a call they found the container right in front of them! It took me 40 minutes to get my food and I was third in line. There were 5 people behind me that may still be there waiting. Unfortunately, several TOGO's in the area have closed. Soon to be replaced with a  restaurant more suited for the changing demographics.<//text>

Ordered chicken santa fe wrap, they said they didn't have spinach wrap but gave me regular wrap, it tasted undercooked, chicken had some fat and forgot to include avocado then bacon. Totally sloppy works! The wrap was falling apart. Not happy here.< /Review>

<review>Gas leaked from pump after filling the has tank. Spilled all over the ground. Went inside to get a drink. Every can of soda was touched with something super sticky, like jelly. Person behind the counter was condescending, rude, and very unhelpful. Would not recommend giving these people your money.</review>< pictures>

None of the items inside the store had prices marked, and when I brought one up to purchase, it was super taxed.

Never seen something like this in America before.< /text>

<text>Worst gas station to ever! Attempted to pour gas in both pumps and either it didn’t process the credit card or ran out of gas. In both cases, ask the cashier about the issue and he couldn’t respond and defer us to pour at a different gas station. So lame. If there’s an issue with the station itself, then put up a sign so people don’t attempt pouring gas and get frustrated.</text>< GmapID>

<text>No baby changing station. I would give it zero stars just for this reason. Also 4 dollars each for a water when normally they're 2 for $3. Expensive, not worth the stop. And if you have a baby, basically screw you. I'm tired of stopping at gas stations with no changing table. Never again. Yeah, I'm bitter, so what. Put a changing table in and maybe I'll change my mind.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
Definitely the poorest place to grab a cold milk. I bought a small container on 8/30, and hit the road to my customer. I was very unpleasantly surprised to find that this milk was not cold and was on the verge of spoiling. Station staff NEED to monitor their dairy selections more closely or fix their refrigeration unit.</Review>

Just dont go here unless it's a last resort. Gas and snack prices are inflated, not to mention that you wont even know the snack price unless you ask up front. Also theres another gas station if you get off here keep going straight beside the highway until you have to turn left.<//text>

New Years night and the belligerent man working there tried to charge me 3.75 for half a cup of hot water to warm a baby bottle in.  I inquired if they'll use the money to clean the bathrooms which are a safety and health hazard.<//Review>

<text>They know they are the last gas before heading up the Grapevine so they feel justified committing highway robbery with their outrageous prices.  If you read this warning in time, stop at the gas station at the Laval Road exit for prices that will be at least $0.50 cheaper.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>I don't know if the owners of this station are members of ISIS, the Mafia, or have an expensive drug habit.
Their prices are currently $1.50 more than I paid 30 minutes ago up the Grapevine in Gorman. This kind of apparent gouging should be illegal. DON'T STOP HERE unless you like having your wallet raped and pillaged!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Racist inconsiderate cashier plus the gas is $1.00 more than any where in the state. Very bad customer service.< /text>

< Review>
Sushi is great as always. The waitress tells you that the soup is only for one person. Misleading. The amount of soup they give you is for minimum of two people. The beef was undercooked in the soup.</Review>

My family has been coming here for the past 10 years. The staff is always so friendly and at this point, knows us and always asks where a family member is if they are not with us at dinner. This is also how things are in the Japan town community. The fish is fresh and the soup is delicious. It's always a must go when I visit my family in San Jose< /Text>

One of my fav spots for delicious Japanese food. I give this place two thumbs up. I will be bringing family next time. Prices that are reasonable. Feels similar to a restaurant in New York I loved.<//text>

<review>What here for a quick lunch and the food was good, but not great. Maybe because I just got lunch specials with the salmon and the beef teriyaki and they didn't taste special really but definitely solid quality and the temperature was not oily. It's a good lunch spot, we'll have to come back in the evening time to try the sushi and give it a rating again.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

We just met friends there for dinner. And we had our 17 month old granddaughter with us. The wait staff was very nice and went out of their way to make sure our granddaughter was comfortable and they were entertaining her. The food and service was good. Our friend’s husband was celebrating his birthday and they came out with a birthday ice cream and candle and a birthday hat for him.< /Review>

Tsugaru was one of the best sushi restaurants I’ve ever been to. Every item was fresh and flavorful. The wasabi and ginger were the best I’ve ever had. The Hana Maki, Yaki Ika, Yosenabe, Fireball, and Green Roll were all very delicious. Highly recommended< /review>

My favorite Japanese food restaurant in all of San Jose. It’s in Japan town on the main strip.

The fish is always fresh and the rolls are epic. Best part is; they always give you extra. I’ve order various sashimi plates and they all came with a few extra pieces, so the prices are actually very good.

Their nigiri is absolutely delicious with huge pieces of fish, like you would find in Japan, not the small little pieces that the USA is used to.

I’d recommend getting the sushi combo plate. It’s enough food for two grown men, costs around $43 but you get so much food, it’s totally worth it.

I love Tsugaru<//Text>

The decor isn't fancy but the food is good.  The rolls are pretty good and quite large.  The size can be a little much to get into your mouth in one bite with chopsticks.  Go ahead, use your fingers.  Perfectly fine.  Don't waste your money on the house wines, this isn't where you go for that.  They also win the award for "only place open on New Years Eve".< /review>

<text>Slowest sushi/Japanese place I've ever been to. This was on a Monday night too. Food was okay when it finally came out but they gave me the wrong hand roll (gave a refund... was off by over a dollar though). Fish is too soft and chewy. All in all a really annoying experience considering we only ordered 3 items and it took around 40+ minutes to come out.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

We've been coming here for many years and it's fantastic.  Food is always fresh, prices reasonable, atmosphere relaxing, and ownership consistent.  Sushi is awesome, but so are the soups and donburis. Highly recommend.</Text>

<text>This was my first time at a Japaneses restaurant. We loved it. One reviewer complained about the house wine, I disagree, don't get me wrong it's nothing special but it was only four bucks. I do wish they had more wine choices. I had seared beef in Japanese BBQ sauce with a salad and soup. The BBQ sauce and beef were wonderful and I loved the salad dressing. My girlfriend had the spicy pork with tempura shrimp and tuna sashimi. She loved it and said the tempura was light and crisp. We will be going back. On a personal note I didn't think all the TV's were needed I didn't get the vibe of this place as being a sports bar but rather a nice family restaurant with excellent food.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcc84e6579ec5:0x99664576d655c147<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Good service and clean. The food was alright, nothing special. The batter on the tempura was a bit too doughy, didn't look/feel right, and the sauce was on the rice instead of on the side, which is a bit odd. Other than that no complaints.< /Review>

The restaurant is clean and the hostess was very nice, and accommodating for a late lunch seating. The Tsugaru Box was all quite good and great value for the cost, definitely will go back for lunch.</Review>

< review>
Pretty good lunch experience. The place is nice, we got a window seat and watched the people pass by. You get good portion sizes and I was stuffed by the end of my combo tempura lunch and the California lover's roll on the side. My friend had the bento box tonkatsu lunch and he enjoyed it. The iced tea glasses were large and cold. The rice was good. The service was friendly and fast. The environment was clean and not too loud, which is great for conversation. Price was reasonable too.<//review>

more like 3.5 stars

ordered seaweed salad, gyoza, unagi nigiri, crunch roll and salmon good stuff

I like how the unagi is served with the smell of char, a sign that it's prepared upon order; crunch roll is bigger than expected for sure, I like their gyoza, it's boiled then lightly seared instead of fully pan-fried, I can still taste the crunch of the veggie inside< /review>

This place has no redeeming qualities. Greasy tempura is not good. Neither is tough mackerel. The interior is drab and the table was irreparably sticky. Could make for a passable school cafeteria.< /text>

<review>I have been eating Donuts from MS Donuts for over 30 years. They have the best donuts hands down. I moved to another state and once a year I come back on vacation and get donuts here several times while staying in Orange. They have great prices and a great selection of donuts. Please help small businesses during this time I want to make sure this donut shop that I love is still here the next time I visit Orange.< /review>< Pictures>

I love this place awesome food portions are more then enough friendly people and great prices . My people orange please support this little whole in the wall place . They have been a supportive group of people in the community for more then 23 years . They are having trouble staying open due to the fact that they are a small place and cash only plus consumers are living large chains due to grub hub and such but we will miss this place if we don’t take care of our local business owners please give this place a chance . Let’s eat people 😀<//text>

<Review>Great place to eat. I've been coming here for the past 25 years ever since they opened. Linda and Andy are the best.  Great portions and reasonable prices. Fresh cook to order or straight off the line all the food is fresh and delicious. I refuse to go anywhere else but I highly recommend that everyone comes here.</Review>< Pictures>

You're not asking for much when you go in. It's not an expensive sit-down  restaurant. You just want to go in and try some delicious donuts. And that's what they were. The staff was nice, the place seemed clean, and the food was great. It's as simple as that.

I got a turkey croissant for breakfast and it was super delicious but the reason for that is it's swimming in butter, so it's not the healthiest thing to eat if that's what you're looking for.

I loved the fruity pebbles donut. It was amazing! I'm going to go back and try their other donuts again because something about their frosting is exquisite and stands out from other places I've tried.. I can't quite put my finger on what it is yet, so I'll have to experiment!< /Text>< Pictures>

Been coming here for years, they treat you like family. It's a small place, not fancy but delicious. I always get the broccoli beef and Orange Chicken. The Best Orange Chicken around!<//Review>

<resp>None< /resp><review>Great food, family owned. Linda is awesome! She always remembers our favorite orders. Prices are reasonable.  Best won ton soup ever, same with the Orange chicken. The food quality is fresh and flavorful.with generous portions. The only reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is 1). They don't take debit /credit cards, cash only...2). It is very small only 4 booths and a table.  Great for take out though

Customers: Please wear a mask to get take out. Transmission of COVID-19 to those who run China Wok would be a disaster for this family and a loss for this community.

I have been going to China Wok for over 24 years. It's like the corner pub, but for Chinese food. Very friendly with many regular customers. I get my lunch (takeout) at China Wok almost every day. I get the 2-item combo for $7.94 including tax. Their food is the best, the portions are large, and you can't beat the price. Service is terrific. They know each customer, what they usually get, and aim to please. I love their mushroom chicken, which also has zucchini and carrots, but I've had many different items and they are all good. I don't eat deep fried items (too many empty calories), so I can't comment on Orange Chicken, etc., but items that are not deep fried are not greasy at all and not as salty as other places with more expensive food. Wonderful flavor. I look forward to it every day.

You should be aware that they don't take credit/debit cards. That keeps their costs low, so it's for the best, in my opinion. It's the only place I use cash, and well worth it!< /text>

Customer Service SUCKED!!!!
He handed me the bag upside down, then when my croissant dropped to the floor, he said  NOTHIN, NADA. I said is there anything you can do, I mean this was clearly a mistake, he said those are expensive. I was like yeah no sh** I just paid $5 for it like a dumb A**, Thanks Ms Donut. Its good to know you care more about Money than your customers.This guy charged way to much, anyway!!!
$3.50 for an Orange Juice COME ON It's squeezed Oranges dude.<//Review>

I went there this afternoon for lunch after long while. Everyone was the same, still served quite good amount as they did, so was the taste. It's been almost 10 years, everytime I pass by on 55, it reminded me of good old days living over there. Hope this place remain, prosper more another 10~20 years.<//Text>

The food is fresh and the best I lived in Vegas and I drive there to get Chinese food because you can't find good Chinese food anywhere out here and it's like family when you go there Linda will remember you from the first time Andy is the cook he will cook you anything you want try the war wangtong soup Wendy is the best she always makes you laugh and feel like family< /review>

Lady was rude rushing me, never friendly and always talking on her phone. Wanted to charge me .10 more on each bar donut and .50 to use my card, when I was never charged that before. There's other donut stores nearby that I'll be getting my donuts at, even if they charge more I'm willing to pay for better friendly service.<//Text>< Rate>

Horrible! I just picked up an order of chicken and shrimp fried rice. Disgusting! Most of the chunks of chicken were covered in fat! You can't even trim the fat off the chicken? No flavor either. Then there were the eggrolls. So greasy I had to throw them away. If the food that is made to order is this bad, I can only imagine how bad the food is in the stream table must be. Really really bad! Try at your own risk. Even Panda Express is ten times better than this place. (Btw, this place, even in 2017, doesn't even accept credit cards. Maybe because they know how bad their food is. If I had paid with my CC I would have had my bank deny the charge.)< /Review>

First thing's first, hair was in a doughnut! We haven't checked some of the others yet. The lady that was working there was so unprofessional. She was incredibly rude and when we asked for some time to look over the selection she just said okay and grabbed a doughnut hole from the case and ate it in front of us.< /text>

The owner/cashier is rude and unfriendly, and the shop itself isn't very clean. Also, the items are overpriced ($1.75 for a can of soda). The donuts themselves are okay though.</Review>

Very friendly service, a wide selection of raspados, juices, snacks, and the best part is if you want to personalize your raspado (you can combine flavors) they will make it just they way you like it, just ask. Clean and very attentive. Everyone who works here is happy and friendly. Service with a smile. The fruit is always fresh (they chop everything). Their new paletas have me excited, there are so many flavors, so creamy, so delicious. The cheese paleta is one of my favorite. They have something for everyone.< /Text>

Woah, so many juice options! Their root beer floats aren't bad either. I went here on a typical LA hot AF summer day and was super parched after riding my motorcycle. Raspados Zone was in the area and I was fiending something to quench my thirst. Ordered a smoothie and a root beer float because why not. Oh man, the smoothie was made fresh and on the spot, the flavors are all upfront and you can taste how fresh they were, and the root beer float was pretty good too. Just a warning, though; don't do what I did by ordering both a smoothie and a float because you won't be able to finish both.</Review>

Nothing like a good old Raspado on a hot day. So refreshing and tasty. Made to order for each person. So many veritys of flavors and drinks with refills. Nice and happy staff and handicapped parking and access and table seating and public restrooms. Their prices are not that bad. A good place to visit throughout the summer and year round.</Text>

Just took my family here and I purchased a Butterfinger bar. As I was eating the bar it tasted funny. I looked at the best by date and it read 7/2018 smh.. the employee in charge told me to get another one. As I checked they all had about a ten month old date. I told the employee I hope I don't get sick and he replied you should be fine. SMH I would like to see him drink 10 month old milk. I have a good feeling it will get me sick.. I will no longer take my family to this place who knows what else is expired.<//Text>

Waste of money , the mango one was frozen mango and it tasted like chemicals. It didn't taste real. We'll not be back and we'll continue going to our raspado place on Francisquito and Azusa.

<review>Love this place! I try ordering something new every time I go. Staff is always friendly and ready when you are. It's hard finding an elotero wo(man) these days, so if you're craving a good normal sized elote/esquite or even a churro como los del swapmeet, this is the place to go. And unlike other places where they don't give you at all what you pay for, this place leaves you wanting more and being able to get more for your buck.< /review>< pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) The place very good the employees very cordial the problem the esquites lacks flavor you do not feel the sabador of the epasote which is what it must feel to taste them on the other hand the churros have a slight flavor of refrigeration I suggest adding a little cinnamon and making the churros on the premises everything else excellent luck in your business

(Original)
El lugar muy bueno los empleados muy cordiales el problema los esquites le falta sabor no se siente el sabador de el epasote que es lo que se debe de sentir al paladearlos por otra parte los churros tienen un ligero sabor a refrigeracion le sugiero agregar un poco de canela y fabricar los churros en el local todo lo demas exelente suerte en su negocio<//review>< UserId.>

I’ve been to this place since 2012 and earlier. The food is nice and all but restrooms are kind of messy sometimes. They also don’t have sockets, so don’t expect to plug those in. The management is very nice and in my years I have not had a problem. The area gets shady at night, so I don’t recommend going at night, its best to go around 4-7 PM.<//Review>

This spot is the one I always prefer. I visit a lot of restaurants but here I keep coming back again and again. The team is very amicable and the food they place on your table is so delicious. I would always prefer to have a good dinner in this restaurant. I highly recommend this place.</Text>

<Review>I'm from Bakersfield and I have to say it's a gorgeous, spacious well kept McDonald's. My order was quick and the servers were kind but I have to say it looked like they just threw my filet o fish sandwich in the box . I've never had to unstick the cheese from the bread to straighten it to that extent.</Review><Rate>4< /Rate></record>

Bad customer service! lack of knowledge. I cancelled an order & they (SM) gave me a return receipt but the money was still pulled from my Card!
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE...as this has not been the first time.</text>

This place has the most amazing service. The staff are really nice and they are always willing to make things right. It is hard to try to please everyone but I notice this place does the most they can compared to other McDonald's.<//Review>

Today I went for the hunting  eggs at McDonald  I notice.  At the time of the raffles. The staff from McDonald's family was winning the prices, I saw all those poor kids jumping to win something but they only have one ticket and they never win. But the staff family had like ten tickets per person  so they win all the prices. I ask one  of the supervisor  why those people had 20 ticket and she laughed  at me and said oh because she had 20 kids. I wish somebody stop and do something for those kid, they deserve  to have the opportunity  to take a toy home.</text>

😒 it's not that great. The food hardly ever taste fresh && they usually mess up drive-thru orders. I had stopped going for a good while because I was annoyed with there service . The service is usually better in the morning. It's rare when they slide the window open and say " good morning or good afternoon " ...</review>

<text>It's McDonald's. The food is exactly what you'd expect... when these fools manage to get your order right. It's ridiculous how often they screw up simple orders. Like a double quarter pounder with no onions. I got a single quarter pounder with onions but no pickles. Stupid mistakes like this are the norm for this location. I stopped going to this one because of how often they get an order wrong.< /text><Rate>2</Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

On 4/15/18 @ 8:00 as I got there iI See the night shift manager and another worker that were going to give out a Happy meal order with toy that had fell on the ground and manager picked it up and threw it in the happy meal box Wich had food in it already and we're going to serve it like that to a customer, it's sad how even that manager couldn't do the right thing and be a role model for the other employees, I called them out on itt just to get bad faces in return and a half full $3× fries  it was a terrible experience all the mistakes I seen that night and bad faces that were made at me while waiting for my order it was horrible the cashier was nice tho and showed her sympathy for what I was going threw with the manager and other staff......before this experience it was good tho......I only go there cuz my kids like the layground and when my kids want their happy meals Wich they love....< /Text>
