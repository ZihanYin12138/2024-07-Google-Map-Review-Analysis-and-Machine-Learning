<Review>Service was amazing!!! I was originally going there for a place called Urban Pizza, but found out it is now El Pueblo Mexican Food. Food was amazing, service was great and fast. The cashier Laura came up to my family at the end asking how we liked the food? Great customer service, will definitely be back again especially to experience the bar side of the restaurant!!! Thank you again for the great food at such a great price to feed my family!!!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Their Burritos can be extremely good. Especially when all special ingredients added at extra cost. $13 for a single burrito is not cheap but it’s full of good extra ingredients makes it amazing tasty lunch. However, I have been ordering from this place few times a week on DoorDash and there is only about 25% chance of getting the quality order.

Rest of the 75% you get missing ingredients or undercooked  fries. I feel like there is two different cooks at this place. One loves his job and the other should be fired.

So ordering from this place is hit or miss gamble with mostly losses.

Good luck on your next order< /text>

Great drinks and mexican food for great prices! Fish tacos are only $1 and california burrito was great. Monthly strawberry cucumber $7 margaritas were amazing as well. Uses fresh strawberries and cucumbers to make the puree for the drink which he strains out after mixing.<//Review>

I stopped by this place today because i was craving mexican food. It was right off the freeway. The prices are not bad at all. They only took about 5 minutes to give me my order. Food was delicious. Place is clean, they also have a bar inside and they have tvs. Its a very relaxed atmosphere. I would definitely come again. Red salsa is delicious<//review>

< Review>
A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY, VERY SMALL PORTIONS FOR A HIGH PRICE,

So just last night I went to El Pueblo in Delmar I normally eat there all the time but I paid for a burrito a simple one bean and cheese burrito with sour cream it was seven dollars and it was like I bought a $.99 frozen burrito at the store! It was very small and had no taste very disappointed very very very disappointed! I do not recommend buying food from the one in Delmar the one off of Birmingham Drive in Cardiff iS EXCELLENT  :(. Do not go to the one in Delmar!!!< /Review>

Very grate!!!! Wonderful service and the food... so on point!!! So glad we went there instead of the McDonalds right across!! the price was about 6 dollars for 4 tacos which filled me up perfectly 👌🏾 not so full to where it hurt but not leaving me hungry!!! Better then spending 12 or 15 dollars on a damn burger that don't even match the same size as the picter and with some frise that seem processed...
DEFINITELYwould go back the next time I visit.... I hope to see that place soon agen!!!! 😍😍😍😍< /Review>

Very good tacos. Ordered 2 fish tacos and one spicy pork. I would rate it 5 stars but one of my fish tacos has no fish.</Review>

Happy customer of El Pueblo at the Birmingham exit (4 miles north). So glad to have the new restaurant here off I5 in the Del Mar area. Got two great burritos, fish tacos (always an amazing deal) and a tostada tonight. They were all wonderful.

Hats off to any business starting up in the COVID-19 era. I wish them all the best. I will be back again and again!</text>

Kickass fish tacos. Right now 2 for $3. This is the best 1.50 taco I've had. I've been eating the .99 tacos at the car wash on Birmingham for years. This is a new location for them.
They have a bar if you want to wash your food down with a beer.
The location used to be Urban Pi and they pretty much left it as is.

I thought $8 was a bit much fit my daughter's bean and cheese burrito but the food is good.< /text>

Great beer selection! Lots of big screen TVs in outside patio. Guacamole is runny, no bueno. No black beans, just refried beans. Fish tacos were good. Chicken tostada was good. Chicken taco & carne asada taco was good, but nothing special. Average Mexican food.<//review>

I ordered a Carne asada burrito to go, which took 30 minutes to get, they weren't even busy. As I was waiting I saw one of the employees sweeping the floor and she was sweeping in the direction of the other guests which would get whatever she was sweeping into the air and in their food, then she was asked by her supervisor to take a burrito to a customer, she put the dirty broom and dustpan down and grabbed the dish with no gloves on nor did she was her hands. After she delivered the food she went back to sweeping, had another order to deliver, put the broom by the hand washing station and neglected to wash her hands and picked up another order. The supervisor said nothing. It was so gross I had them cancel my order.</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Carne asada quesadilla is the best. Greasy and delicious food. Best spicy salsa  needs to be spicier but is good. Great flavor. Don't buy the fountain drink 3.00 for a LG cup 2.50 for a small. Not worth the price on soda. Everything else is tasty and reasonably priced. Expect to spend 25 or more for 2 ppl</Text>

Came in for fish tacos. One of them was enormous, no way you could even take a bite. The other was about 1/6th the size, quite off putting visually. I took my first bite, the fish was cold. Fortunately they remade them, but it really was not good. I wouldn't go back and I do not reccomend the fish tacos.</review>

The closest to authentic Mexican food I had anywhere in the US. The place is very nice and clean, very friendly staff, everyone kind and willing to help. The best feature is that this is not the tipical taco place, not as formal as a restaurant and at the same time above all of them, it has class. You can sit down, enjoy your meal with a refreshing cold beer or a nice glass of wine, even a clamato if you like. No hard liquor. The best Chile Relleno I had in a long time and the adobada is excellent. Great family place!!< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Let me start off with saying if you like Mexican food with no flavor eat here,The food taste like water No taste, number two I ordered four tacos she took my order one pork two Asada one chicken The cashier takes my order no problem 15 minutes later she comes to me and says you can’t mix the meats How funny just a little spoon of meat can’t mix it I said OK I’ll take a refund since I had Taquitos that had no flavor But if you like food with no flavor this is your place.<//text>< time>

<rating>4</rating><review>(Translated by Google) Every time I have gone, it is fine, today I was not happy I asked them for an extra tortilla to my order and they told me that they could not give it to me, it did not occur to them to say that they gave it to me paying extra, that was bad 👎 and they put the tortillas aside. next to the food and lastly they forgot to put a fork on me it was today

Todas las veces que he ido esta bien hoy no me quede contento les pedí una tortilla extra a mi orden de plato y me dijeron que no podían dármelo no se les ocurrió decir que me lo daban pagando extra que mal 👎y aparte me pusieron las tortillas junto ala comida y de último se les olvidó ponerme un tenedor fue el día de hoy</review>< Pics>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Well I liked it at the beginning because of their move in special but after the first 2 years I don't anymore because of the huge increase that keeps going up and up and up. My storage was broken into last week and I was finally notified 2 days later. The latch was broken off last week and has yet to be repaired. I don't like having to pay for insurance monthly either if it isn't my choice or option. especially if it is supposed to be monitored.  It had been broken into and nobody was monitoring the screen while it was in process. Then I am told 2 days later. Would you expect a good review afterwards? Sorry.

HELLO everyone... I have a happy update.. They did end up making me a happy customer and I am still there! Happy endings are still possible in life!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The folks at Extra Space Storage are very friendly and are always very helpful  when asking questions about my storage needs or my account.  Their prices are great vs. the competitors locally.  They also have a moving truck that they allow you to use once you have a signed contract.  I would recommend them to anybody needing storage.</Review>

I am a highly experienced Corporate Residential Property Management Professional who recently obtained the services of Extra Space Storage on 4020 Wible Road in Bakersfield, CA on 10/13/2014. I admit, I was slightly apprehensive to the idea of using a storage facility initially because it was my first time, and I wasn't sure of the process, but as I approached the office for my 5:30pm reservation I would soon learn the meaning of excellent customer service in this industry. I had the pleasure with working with an awesome manager by the name of Candace who provided me with all of the information I needed, provided me with an ultra-convenient location for storage. When I originally scheduled the reservation for a smaller unit, I noted that once I actually say the square footage wasn't enough, Candace immediately accommodated me to a larger unit in the same convenient location. The overall experience was smooth and put all my initial apprehensions to rest knowing that this facility was under the management of staff who were competent, kind, and experienced. FIVE STARS for EXTRA STORAGE SPACE on WIBLE!!!<//Text>

I was using this storage for my company. They were kind enough to receive all my weekly deliveries from FedEx and have placed in my storage. Zero break ins, the facility was secure. New employee Jared is so awesome,  calls me when I get deliveries. He actually made the place go from 4 stars to 5! Thank you!<//Text>

I was looking for a storage space. I looked at the Derrels but i was dissatisfied with the lady that i spoke with there, as she seemed disinterested in securing me as a customer. I called Extra Space and the lady who I spoke with, Yvonne, was great. She was friendly and professional. Went down there and rented a unit. Place is clean and secure. They were a pleasure to deal with and i have had no issues in the few months that i have been a customer there. All i can say is when you do have to speak to someone at a storage place, youll want it to be this place.<//text>

< Review>
After renting at several other local storage places and having had nothing but bad experiences from short access hours to stolen property with inoperative surveillance cameras I found EXTRA SPACE access hours from 6am to 10pm (the longest I've seen locally) Working Surveillance cameras and a not only friendly but very helpful staff, Manager Karen Martinez was very quick to not only return my call after leaving a message at closing hour but al a o to accommodate my storage needs quickly. I "totally" recommend this place to anyone needing some  "EXTRA  SPACE STORAGE"

I wish everyone you meet was as knowledgable as Ms. Candice Little. She was very friendly and extreamly kind. She knew her business on price and measurements on the storage units. Her knowledge of the sizes of each unit was exceptionally well.Her manners where very proper and sincerely genuine Like I stated in the beginning I wish I could meet others like Ms. Little everyday!!.</review>

Great place, reasonable prices, & plenty of parking.
Sometimes, long waiting times to get in; but they do their best.
They always have something that's worth getting; not all dispensaries can boast that!</text>

Since you guys change the online order to the front desk my orders take forever to get and I watch more ppl pass me in the non online order area it's very sad feels like online orders are getting the short end of the stick first complaint ever by the way just makes no sense to order online anymore when 9 ppl pass me and I'm only second in the online order line - I'm just saying</text>

Good quality bud and such, lots of selection for being the only spot in Hollister. Walk in wait time is a thing but thats of course to be expected at all dispensaries. First time customer discount was 10% and they had a special so I ended up getting a few pre-rolls for 1 cent each (for every 30 bucks spent) and like 12 bucks off my order. No complaints here. Do it!!< /review>

If that isn't enough to sway your decision, their prices are highly competitive and weekly and daily deals make them even more affordable. Very professional atmosphere but still welcoming.

Genesis Marketplace took hold of the south bay’s first dispensary, and rightfully! Other than the vast options for products, they have the best staff You could ask for. You won’t find a more friendly and informational staff anywhere else!</text>

<text>Recently opened in town and it never seems busy. They are so organized they have you in and out in a flash or will take their time assisting you with any questions that you may have, or just want to take your time looking over their products. All bud tenders are very pleasant and knowledgeable. They have daily specials, online items with photos,  price's and quantities. Just remember they only take cash and you need your ID to get passed  security waiting at the door. The receptionist checks you in and can answer most questions, along with a wall menu that is updated often, in the lobby where they also offer seating , and a small supply of incidentals for sale. They have wheelchair access,  parking, and a discount for those with proper identification.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
Let’s start off with the customer service here.
I’ve had nothing but good experiences at this place. I come here strictly for the concentrates. With that being said I’ve had great experience here with all their products. One thing I do wish they could work on is their on line order menu. Most products aren’t labeled indica or sativa nor do they display the thc/CBD percentage. If they could work on that, they would be that much better.</Review>

Awesome community, they have the knowledge and are super polite all the way around. It's secure and quick in and out. I recommend trying the house flower as it's cheap for good bud! Enjoy!</text>

staff wasn't very knowledgeable at all. don't plan on taking your time because they rush you to the max and if you ask questions be prepared to get passive aggressive attitude responses. The quality of everything was okay but very over priced.< /review>

I've been to a handful of dispensaries over the years but this one is in my hometown!

Felt safe, secure, respected, and felt like I got a good deal! (Fair prices)

Will definitely be back, many times!< /review>

I went on a sunday so on sundays it's 20% off your total so that was combined with my first time customer 20% discount so i got a total of 40% off of my total. I went in looking for something that can help me sleep and the staff was so helpful and friendly. The girl that helped me gave me so much info and helped me choose something since i don't really consume it only tried it when i was a teen but never cared for it. I will definitely be going back soon im very happy with the outcome of my visit here.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Ordered Pork Chow Mein, Fried Rice and Fried Shrimp. And of course the Great Pot Sticker< /Text>

Order the house special plate but the put way to much pepper on the noodle ask for a new plate with less pepper but they just gave me my old plate back. Than ask if they not gonna make a new plate with no pepper than give our refund back but they refuse to cooperate. The order of fried shrimp is super hard and it taste super old. Horrible customer service they don't even care about the customer at all. Would not eat here and will not recommend this place to anyone.</text>

Just tried this place for the first time last week, very friendly staff, good prices, and very good food. Portions are pretty big imo so you will have a good lunch & dinner the following day. Personally, the Chinese style chow mein is my favorite.</review>

<rate>2</rate><Name>OTAKU FANBOY</Name><review>Disappointing. I'd have to agree with lots of reviews negative and positive. Big portions? Just the noodles. Small portions? The meat and rice. About 75% of the dinner plate was "pork chowmein" which was virtually flavorless noodles with 3 small pieces of pork put on top. Mixed old and fresh food. Meat over done and some pieces like leather. Fried rice just browned rice sprinkled with a couple little things for flavor. The sweet and sour sauce I liked as well the egg flower soup, but neither was great. Service not great. Ordered for here but given in bags to go and had to ask for napkins, and forks spoons which were plastic. Disappointing selection of drinks, just plain coffee, fountain soda and water. Price was slightly above average. You're better off going to Panda Express or Lin's Fusion in town but for the best ever Daikokuya if you get to Little Tokyo L.A. I won't be coming back here nor would I recommend.</review><gmapID>0x80945c77458980cd:0x28a56622ce8aca1< /gmapID>< user_id>

I used to go here all the time before the pandemic. I dont know what happened but our dinners tonight were inedible!!! Everything was gross. So so disappointed! Should have been warned by their new sign in the window saying no refunds.< /review>

He passed on in September 2004.
However, much culinary arts wisdom was given unto me as knowhow, this originally and collectively, even though 3 of my immediate family members are now gone: brother [11/17/1948-11/13/1969], father [05/07/1925-10/16/1998], and mother [07/07/1927-01/14/2020], they tought me much, culinarywise, as I made time and attendance for it.

<Review>I'll never go there again. Yes they have pickup at the door. Ordered my food sat in the car for it to finish. But here is why I'll never go back. As I was pulling a way I saw one of the cooks put is finger up his nose and go right back to cooking the food. Disgusting plus we're in the mid of the   Pandemic, enough said.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< rating>

<Text>It's hard to write this because the owners are so nice but hopefully they read this because they need to know -
We always get the same thing, a sweet & sour pork combination plate and a fried shrimp combination plate. The problem seems to be that the pork and the shrimp are cooked FAR in advance and are tough and chewy to the point that they aren't edible. Our went in the trash last time. The fried rice also seemed to be cooked far in advance as it was room temp and dry. The chow mein was OK but also cooked in advance and barely warm.
I understand the need to prepare food a LITTLE in advance so that you can get orders out quicker but it should never be more than a few minutes, not hours or seemingly sometimes even the day before.
Hopefully things change because we'd like to come back.<//Text>< pics>

Huge portions with wonderful food!  Takeaway seems to be their mainstay. You can eat in as well. Very good menu selection all meals can be shared by at least two people. Prices are excellent. This is a hidden food gem.< /Text>

Bare bones as a sit down place, but good food every time, and a great deal...delicious and very generous portions...usually ready pretty quick too. No mystery why they've been around as long as they have.

Note they will be closed from July 15-30, 2019 for summer vacation, and reopen July 31st.< /Review>

Been eating here for years. Always nice portions of food at affordable prices. The food is much more tasty and authentic than most other Chinese takeout around the area. The portions we get normally allow us to have leftovers for the next day. This seems to make the meal really worth the purchase because if you throw the food in a pan with some water the food is as bomb as it was fresh. 5 out of 5 stars from me.</review>

First of all, very friendly service. Affordable lunch options. I paid $7 and change for a BBQ lunch special and a small drink. My gripe is the fried rice and slices of pork. The pork is dry.  The fried rice has no visible egg and about a pea or two. Is this a common thing in Clovis/Fresno? The lunch special did come with a side of chow yuk which is like a stew with chunks of chicken and veggies. That was actually very satisfying. Not sure if I would come again. I'd like to try other menu options in order to give a more fair review<//Review>

We have been going to Kowloon Kitchen for over 40 yrs.  Its been owned by a couple of different people over that time.  Right now it has excellant service and the food is fantastic!  The prices are great!  We love it, we went twice just in the last 3 weeks.  Never been disappointed.< /Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I got there so called lunch special (noodles with orange chicken)$5.74. I was disappointed because there noodles were cold and it look like has been precooked. The chicken was cold too and just covered with orange favoured sauce. They didn't provide any water or anything. Never coming back here 😓😠<//Review>< Pics>

Ordered the Mandarin dinner & it was ready in 60 seconds. No joke. Everything was cold & seemed like leftovers. I would give zero stars if I could.< /text>

This is an iconic institution in Clovis. It has been in business for decades. The food is prepared fresh when you order it, the portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. In my view, it's the best Chinese food restaurant in California.<//Review>

I have been eating Kowloon for over 40 years. It was my favorite restaurant. The last time we had gone to the restaurant we had to travel 22 miles as we have moved. Ordered my most favorite Eggrolls noting that every thing on the menu had gone up considerably, charged me for sweet and sour sauce in which used to get along with order free! Paid with my debit card and was handed a machine in which I had to pay a mandatory tip. Got home to find the egg rolls to be half the size as usual and contents inside looked like it had already been chewed up and the taste was nothing like I was expecting! What happened to the Kowloon I loved for so long!< /Text>

<text>We have been coming to Kowloon Kitchen for 20+ years now. Love there big crispy egg rolls and the special plate is always plenty of food to share or eat on for a whole day and left overs. Our whole family will share several items from the menu and it makes for a feast at really affordable price. Its pleasant seeing the same faces for so many years here. I remember the younger adults who run the cash registers now, sitting and doing homework as little kids.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80945c77458980cd:0x28a56622ce8aca1<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place has been around forever! My parents used to get food from here when I was young. Strayed away from it for a long time but, today, we just thought about trying it again. The prices continue to be very reasonable and the amount of food you get is enormous. It seems to be less saucy than what I remember and it appears freshly prepared. I wasn't impressed with the orange chicken, it lacked in appearance and the flavor was standard. Everything else was pretty descent</Review>

I have been going here for years ever since I was really young I have never had any problems they have nice friendly service and the food is always warm and delicious I would recommend it for anyone who has a family of four or more order two or three of the mandarin dinners and I always have leftovers anyone who says anything bad about this restaurant has very poor judgement< /Review>

Don't go and order around closing time, you will get leftover food from early in the day or day before
Ordered Dinner plate special. Fried  shrimp  was hard, dry and tough. Bbq pork slices were also dry and tough. So disappointed !! Never before had food this bad from this restaurant.<//text>

I'm not sure if the people that rated 1 star even like chinese food in the first place which defeats the purpose of rating.  Anyways... Food is good plain and simple. Is it the best, probably not and I have only had Chinese food from three places in Fresno and this is the one I have liked the best. They are fast, courteous and cook in front of you so you know there is no reheating. The prices are great for the portions they serve. I made the mistake of ordering three plates; one for my wife, child, and me... we could have eaten with at most two plates, but have gotten away with one plate. I ordered for my employees cause it was on my way to work and everyone loved it. RECOMMENDED< /review>< time>

< Review>
Horrible attitude, bad service and dishonor for respectable Chinese restaurants.  I order a soup and lomain.  They don't provide a regular spoon and they don't care about clients. Too arrogant to accept that a dessert spoon is not  for a large cup of soup. Also they don't accept returns of anything even when they have not the minimum sense of service or polite attitude.  $18 dollars.  The chicken smelled like expired . You can go anywhere and you will have better service. DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. Go to HUNAN BY HERNDON AND CEDAR AVENUE. GET THE RIGHT SERVICE AND FOOD ACCORDING TO YOUR DOLLAR. NONSTANDARD U.S. RESTAURANTS SHOULD DISSAPEAR. ALSO THEY KEEP MY RECEIPT DANGEROUSLY BECAUSE IT IS THE POSIBLE EASY WAY YO AVOID TAXES.< /Review>

I've been eating here since I was a kid. Portions are huge and food is great. I recommend calling in before going to pick up your order, if they're busy it can take anywhere between 20-30 minutes.<//text>

<text>This was my third time here so I thought at this point maybe if I got something different it would be good. I was wrong! maybe people like it so much because of the time it's existed but the shrimp are absolutely horrible it's more batter than shrimp and super greasy so expect a stomach ache. They gave me a whole chicken wing with no chicken inside of it literally just batter. And every dish under the noodle section is the same meal unless you get a different meat. I'm just being completely honest. There's sauce even taste sold the chili sauce I mean. Time means nothing if the food is just getting nastier< /text><user>103851435636706693679<//user></record>

<review>So yes the portions are big,  but you get alot of dried up over cooked food. My wife ordered shrimp meal, all over fried hard as a rock and one even had a hair with a folickle in it. My pork was dry and the sweet and sour pork was so hard because it may have been the left over pork from another day. That some how they thought putting it as sweet and sour pork and bury it in sauce maybe people would eat it. So yes thank you Google people for giving this place 5 stars. I am not even calling them to replace my order, why so I can get more old food!<//review><rate>2< /rate><pictures>None<//pictures>< userid>

Huge portions for cheap! I regularly order the special chow mein. The only thing that I don't like is that sometimes the lady boils the meat and vegetables to finish quickly, and as a result, the vegetables become mushy. Every time I go, I always have to ask them not to overcook the vegetables.</Review>

Kowloon kitchen was a great Chinese spot about 15 yrs ago. It has gone through so many hands the food is just horrible. The pork used to make sweet and sour is as hard as Rick. It's dried overcooked. The Orange chicken is cooked the same as the pork dried out, don't mention the fried rice. It tastes as if its been sitting out exposed to air all day long.  I have to say it is the uavthe worst< /review>

We ordered food to go back in March 2016, when we came to the restaurant to pick up our order we saw a cockroach climbing onto the stove top area! We got out of there as fast as we could. I understand that most restaurants have issues somewhere, however, if their infestation is so bad that they bugs are actually coming out while people are cooking in the area...their problem is extremely severe and totally not worth getting sick from.

I will not be going here ever again.</Review>

The chow mien had a flour sauce over the top that tasted like.....well flour! It was so bland tasting. It was such a HUGE amount of crap food! Sad it all went in the garbage. Yep, not going back there.</Text>< Pictures>

The egg rolls are the size of burritos!   Though I'm not into them because of how huge and greasy they are, but I'm sure most people wouldn't mind trying one.<//review>< username>

Sad  to say I was brought for the first time here to try their food and had bad customer service food was ok and to top it off I sat in front of the Kutcher and witness with my own eyes the lady pick up chicken for the orange chicken from the floor and put it back in the food. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN AND MIGHT EVEN CALL code enforcement. ..😠😤😤</review>

So sorry, no good customer service, found a lash on my chicken, lady in front, denying even after looking at it. Asked for extra plates to serve my guests it bothered her, asked for ketchup, she was just plane rude. It's been years after giving them a second time after another incident. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!</text>

<Review>Jae was great! Very personable and explained the different codes and all steps. I usually use the HR Block online service. I just wanted to come in person to check on a few things since this this past tax-year was different than most, and to make sure I'm filling correctly.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x8085778fd5a0ea71:0xe9c5b4b613568661< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I don't fee as though my refunds are being processed properly. I deserve more back I donated a car in 2020 through Make a Wish Foundation i gave the paper work to H&R Block they told me there wasn't anything I could get due to the fact in would have to have been an itemized return 12k or $1,100 which was the sale of the donated vehicle at auction time. I basically gave away the car to a charity & was fooled by the organization & H&R didn't do anything to try & make amends on the behalf of my donation. Every year I see the same exact tax consultant & pay a fee plus H&R's piece of mind & a bank fee etc.. I need to learn how to do my own taxes I'm always paying for services instead of trying to get things done myself. I go to them every year & trust them with my information yet I'm on the customer shouldn't they have tried to help me. I'm short $1,100.00<//review>< userid>

Tony Wong is the best, I was referred to him by my mother over 10 years ago and I have been coming back to him since then.  Total professional who cares about his clients, he is an asset to your company and his community.< /Review>

The person doing my taxes filled out the same form I could have done online and offered no insights at all. I had to actually show two employees where certain form fields were, and had to correct numerous misspellings. The tax professional also entered the wrong forms and had to delete them later, wasting a bunch of time.

At the end, I got a quick screen "these are your tax tips for next time" and the preparer just clicked through before I even had a chance to read them.

It was clear they had little experience using their own software or simply did not care about the job they were doing.

In fact, my girlfriend had her taxes done at the same time and her preparer was even worse. She literally left in tears after the preparer entered her forms incorrectly and vastly overestimated the amount she owed. Then he blamed the system for not being intuitive (you would think he should know how to use his own software after 20 years in the business!)

Finally, the woman waiting with us had a scheduled appointment but was told that her tax preparer would be running "30 minutes late". She was still waiting when we left almost 2 hours later.

Train your tax professionals in customer service skills. Actually have them explain what they are doing and why. Make sure they know how to use their own software and have exposure to non-standard tax forms. I shouldn't have to show them how to do their own job, and fill out the forms for them, when I am paying more than 200 dollars per hour.

I will not be returning to this location again any time soon.</review>

<review>Chuck Taylor All-Stars or Converse All Stars (also referred to as "Converse", "Chuck Taylors", "Chucks", "Cons", and "All Stars") is a model of casual shoe manufactured by Converse (a subsidiary of Nike, Inc.since 2003) that was initially developed as a basketball shoe in the early 20th century. The design of the Chuck Taylor All Star has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in the 1920s. The shoe consists of a stitched upper portion, a toe cap that is usually made of white rubber, and a sole that is usually made of brown rubber. Although Chuck Taylors are made of various materials such as leather, the original and most widely known version of the shoe is made from cotton canvas. The innovative detail of the original shoe was the "loose lining" of soft canvas that was intended to provide flexibility and prevent blisters.

The Chuck Taylor II, an improved model, was announced by company management in July 2015. Incorporating Nike technology, it retains the outward appearance of the original shoe while employing a modern lightweight material for the insole.[1]<//review><response>None</response>< user_id>

Purchases shoes for the family. One pair needed to be returned and they would only give store credit. Now I returned to get more shoes and the card shows 0 balance and they said there is no way to check it. Be careful with store credit from them. Or have them check to make sure they loaded it correctly.</Text>

Never a disappointment with shoe quality or with customer service. I always take my time shopping here and staff is always there to help out if needed. Great deals are always happening so take advantage of that if you're planning to buy shoes and/or shirts there. I always find my shoe size here so that's convenient.< /Text>

<review>If you go here, ask for George! He's helped us two years running now (no pun intended), and remembers is even though we're only there once a year. Very helpful staff, and a great selection of clearance and new merchandise both. Definitely check it out if you like Chuck Taylor's!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

A bunch of Chuck Taylors available at buy one get one for 70% off. Aside from that the shelves are disorganized with stock price of boxes like you were at the warehouse itself. Staff is accommodating to and friendly and if you want to go without the crowds then go on the weekday. The shop is bright and the store is very clean.<//Review>

<Text>California's overlooked museum and underrated as well.
This place of historical significance was amazing.
Our tour guide is George and he was a wealth of information from each and every door, stairway, and room.
No pets allowed but fantastic job  by the friendly and well trained staff!!
If I could give more than five stars I would.
Thanks again George!!!!<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I actually really enjoyed my visit here. I went during their Spirit Tour and it was centralized around the ghosts and paranormal experiences people have has there, it was also really informative.
They have regular tours as well. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable and seem to enjoy working there.
I would absolutely come again< /review><user>101669936916767003424< /user>< response>

Very interesting place i highly recommend it because it is the last civil war post in CA, but the guide we had was really condescending to my 9 year old that didn't know much about the civil war yet and she was OCD about making us move in a certain direction through the tour, and not touching anything at all except for the stair banister. She seemed like over the top about it. I thought she could have been a little more friendly towards my daughter she was obviously knowledgeable but no personality whatsoever and made my daughter feel like an idiot.</text>

<review>The Last time I went was years ago, and I just want to say that this place has a lot of history behind it and if you want to know more about the history of Wilmington Ca. and know more about Phineas Banning and all this indeed is the place to come to for a plenty of history about Wilmington as well as the Drum Barracks Museum. It is really a neat museum as well as you can really learn a lot about this place and how Wilmington was founded and about this wonderful Museum. So if you would like some history about Wilmington Ca. and all Please come here to the Drum Barracks Museum you will get a lot of history as well as learn more about how Wilmington was founded. Please come here it is great. I also got to sing here for the founding of this place years ago and I was glad that I got to sing when this place was refounded. Thank you so much.< /review></record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>It was closed when we arrived, but just walking around the perimeter of the grounds gives an amazing sense of the history. It is a fascinating since we so often think very little of the Civil War in LA because, as a state, we where new to the nation. Completely worth the visit.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

<review>Bought a $65 bubbler from The Dungeon. Tried to use it but was having an issue with it not bubbling. Upon closer inspection,  the stem wasn't even attached to the bowl, as in there was a defect in the glass and the base of the stem didn't line up with the bowl. I went in and asked to get it switched out for a different one but was told to come back after 9:00pm since the manager would have to authorize it. I went in tonight and was told I cannot trade it for a non defective one nor can I get a refund because I had used it once. The reasoning is "it can't be put back on the shelf" if it's been used. It is a defective bubbler that shouldn't have been sold to begin with and shouldn't be resold, regardless. Out a bubbler and $65. Would not recommend shopping for glassware as they do not hold their products up to par and don't right their wrongs. 👎<//review>< pics>

Just want to say the owner of this place is obviously awesome and let me tell you why. After being totally outed by the fire of which we’ve all heard about, the camp fire. Rick is the first solid business owner who; when asked about sharing his business location with me to help a CAMP-FIRE survivor regroup, has extended his hand to meet with me and discuss sharing some of his space! (Shout out to high five too)

I not only love the clothing that he has because it feels great and looks awesome on campus but give him a tip of my hat for having a keen business eye when it comes to making money, for giving CSU Alumni and CAMP FIRE survivor(s) hope of re-opening the door to self sustainability. Respectfully “Hats off” from one Butte Strong to another; to Rick from Jeff Donnelly.< /Text>

Hands down best smoke shop in Chico. Staff are always welcoming as if you are part of the family. Family run business, great atmosphere, great music always playing, best prices on glass and novelty's for great quality. Anytime I go in for something and they don't have it the next time I go in they end up having it, they are great at getting what the customer wants. Ehab (E)  is always making jokes he's a very funny guy, and always has great advice for all my smoking needs, he's very knowledgeable as well as his father (Rick). The main reason I LOVE The Dungeon is because of the staff, to be honest every smoke shop has the same stuff in them but for the past 25 years that they've been in business the hospitality and compassion for the customer and their needs are most important. Not a single time have I left The Dungeon in disappointment! DungeonBoysForLife!</Review>

<Text>I, with all honesty, cannot even give this business a one star rating. My very first visit to this business was on the 28th, April. I went online, and checked out all of the 'headshops' in town, and came to the conclusion that I would go and check out, 'The Dungeon" smoke shop. I went in, looked over the array of merchandise. I was not overly impressed, but hey, for all intents and purposes, there was a plentiful selection. I did not find exactly what I wanted, and therefore compromised, on a rather decent looking, bright yellow pipe, of frosted glass, with a silhouette of, Bob Marley. After using the pipe, I decided to clean it. I took a q-tip, and some hot water and proceeded to clean. As the cleaning proceeded, I realized that the yellow was coming off. After further examination, and a bit more cleaning, I realized that the 'yellow' was not infused within, rather, the inside of the pipe was simply hand painted yellow. I was furious that I was sold not only and inferior item, but also, and item that eventually would have damaged not only my lungs, but my very life. I went back the next day, intent on at least getting an exchange. A friend came along. I was greeted by two men, one, the son of the owner, the other, a large red headed guy. I will admit, that my attitude upon entering was borderline surly, though, I never raised my voice. After explaining the situation, I was bluntly told that it did not matter to them. I bought the pipe, and used it, therefore it was not returnable, and, the son of the owner told me that there would be no exchange either, and to get out of his store. He made it succinctly clear that He did not care about my displeasure, or the quality, ( or lack of ), of the pipe. At this point, not only did I become incensed, but so did my friend. After a bit of attempting to calm the situation,  the large red headed guy became a bit verbally aggressive towards myself, and my friend. We were told to get out, threats of calling the police were made, on both sides, and if we had any more issues, we could bring it up with the father. I returned 2 hours later, as instructed, to not find the father there. The owners son was there, and still, with disdain, he informed me that I was not going to get an exchange or a refund. Suffice to say, at this point, all civility went out the door. I made it clear that at least, an exchange was going to happen. I also made it clear that I knew for a fact that this smoke shop sold drug paraphernalia to minors. After a silence of 5 minutes, I was given a decent exchange. I will never go back to this establishment. It is a prime example of the type of smoke shops that ought to not be in business. I will take my business to, Blaze N J's, or, Dragon Tobacco.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808327ba5f197e6d:0x5e31fb9492a334e7</gmap_id></record>

They kind of gave me an answer. They did what basically what everyone else here in San Francisco does. Make what should be a simple yes or no into something much more complicated. Had to call some place else if I remember correctly to see what they thought about my ?< /text>

<Text>Shuping and Jonathan were amazing, thorough, professional, and outstanding! Me and my partner had very complicated multi-state returns and they went above and beyond to make sure we got the best refunds. I highly recommend them and look forward to working with them next year.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>I went in thinking I owed based on trying to do my own taxes but luckily I decided to make an appointment with Shuping and she saved the day!  I'm receiving a return for both State and Federal.  She mentioned a few new tax relief laws that were applicable to me and I felt a sense of relief! Thank you!<//text>< Pictures>

I’ve always had the same tax pro each year who wasn’t available this year.  Shoutout to Jose, started off with him changing the appointment time  on me and acting like it was just such an inconvenience for him, made nonstop spelling errors while doing the taxes that I had to catch, and ended with him changing the price by nearly $100 from what he quoted me after looking through my documents at the start of the session.   He couldn’t justify it and just ran away leaving me to pay the bill.  Would NOT recommend him.</Text>

< review>
My experience with H&R Block was really bad but then I was finally connected with the District Manager, Sharon Degener who has, perhaps, the most outstanding customer service skills I have ever encountered. After getting the runaround for months and poor communication from the preparer I was working with, she not only honored the original fee given to me, but she gave me some additional compensation if I use them next year and promised to hand select someone. She re-instilled some confidence.<//review>

Rigo was awesome and answered all of our questions. We were in and out within 15 minutes.

Update: We ended up renting the unit for 3 months and the light bulb in the unit was shot from day 1. Rigo promised to take care of it, never happened. Followed up with him three separate times, was told numerous excuses each time about maintenance workers coming to fix etc. Exit gate always broken and yellow-taped. Walls were cheaply built and broken as well, you could actually see our stuff from outside! Anyone could have easily break the wall to get into our unit<//text>

<review>I AM SO HAPPY - I am in the process of moving out of  State temporarily and I have been going to storage facilities to try my hardest to find the right one because trust me - you need to find people that you can trust, have a great attitude, helpful, maintain a good operation and are just straight up amazing at their customer service - I have to just say thank you and give a shout out to Martha who finally helped me start feeling comfortable with the idea of using a storage unit - she was so helpful, knowledgeable, personable and professional- this is definitely where I would trust to store my items. Also this place is really well kept up !!!! All the other places I’ve gone to have been an utter disappointment- thank you so much to Martha - you rock !<//review>< Pictures>

Hey just wanted to leave a 5star review on the excellent customer service I’ve received from public storage. Very friendly people and they really care. I lost my keys and I have all my things in storage and not even 10 mins of being there the staff assisted me in removing my old lock so I can replace it. Thank you guys</Text>

This location has a nice peoperty,easy access and great workers. Got helped by a beautiful young lady named Cynthia and she helped me with all the information i needed to know about renting a space. She showed me around the property and  even offered me some great deals on boxes. Public storage is highly recommended. Thank you Cynthia for all of your help.< /Review>

Unfortunately they did not have the size that I needed available but their great associate there, Rigo was so very kind enough to help me find a location nearby that had the unit size that I needed, at the sale price! Rigo went above and beyond by finding the unit that I needed. He even made arrangements for me with the manager at the Sheldon Street location,  to give me a tour of available units in my size category and paving the way for a smooth rental. At a time when everything is stressful and hectic,  Rigo certainly made the rental process the easiest part! Thank you, Sir!<//text>< response>

I have rented at PS before ,and Iam sure it wont be the last but this time I have to say I have been treated very well by Rigo. He is a great person and good for biz. He really knows his stuff, he helped me decide what size of space I needed and reminded me that I needed a lock. He was very helpful giving me packing and storage tips. i will def. recommend this PS to my friends and family. Iam a very happy camper. Thanks again Rigo :)< /Review>

<name>Bills Money<//name><Date>1530347961150< /Date><rating>5< /rating><review>Excellent customer centric care and attention. Place is well kept and very accessible since it's right off the 5 freeway and close to the 405 & 170 freeways. Early morning and late access from 6am to 9pm everyday makes it convenient for busy people and most work schedules. Rigo is laid back and knows everything about the storage industry. He'll set you up with the right deal and match the quantity of your things to the right unit. This is a good place to store your things. He set me up right and followed up with me through email and phone. Also gave me advice/suggestions about how to donate certain items I wanted to get rid of to various charities.  Most workers don't want to interact ...not the case with Rigo. Thanks.<//review>< pics>

Decent rates but poorly maintained. No light in units. Only one of the gates works. Units walls are broken and accessible easily from mid passages. Service is very good.<//Text>

This facility is clean. The management is always helpful. I’ve been here 2 years, and I’m confident to say that the manager on site Rigo is helpful, courteous, and professional. If you need anything he will take time to speak with you, give you advice, and generally makes doing the whole “public storage” thing an enjoyable and fun experience. Rigo if you see this, you earn your 5-stars every time I deal with you. Went in to pay my bill and he always has a positive attitude. Had to go online so others know this is a well-run location.</text>

Ive had my storage there since december and everyone working there is really cool, but in particular i want to thank Rigo he is way polite, respectful, and very determined to make sure if im satisfied with my storage space, if i need more or less room  every time i see him. Its the reason ive been comforrable leaving my stuff there.</Text>

From the moment I walked in, I already fell in love with the place. The aesthetics, vibe, and the eclectic selection of restaurants has it all in this place. The outdoor area of Haven City provides ample seating and beautiful scenery for photo ops or even hanging out. So far, I have only tried On + On (amazing and flavorful food) and Native Son Bar. Great drinks & happy hour. I can't wait to go back!<//review>

Wow this place is amazing 🤩 talk about having a food variety all in one place what a great idea, with indoor outdoor eating space!! A lot of different food options and desserts too! Nice and big spacious environment this is my first time here and I will definitely be back to try more food options, I mean why not!

Love coming here! There's something for everyone and tbh it makes me nostalgic for NYC. Also, don't sleep on the gelato shakes from popbar or the shrimp fried rice (I can't remember which kiosk it was from). Good food all around.< /Text>

<review>Haven City Market is a relatively new place which is really just a collection of great restaurants with expansive outdoor dining. None of the restaurants at Haven City are massive businesses so if you are looking for a places like that then Haven City Market isn’t the place to go. However, if you are looking for smaller businesses with great food then you’re in the right place. I’ve only eaten at a few places there but they were all amazing. I found the Cauldron to be a great place for ice cream. Overall, a really nice market witch even nicer food.<//review><name>Benjamin Snitzer<//name></record>

A great culinary hub in RanchoCucamonga. I enjoy the diverse food select and open area atmosphere. I highly recommend it for families, and even casual business meetups. Seems great for the casual date as well. Damn, I just realized I'm single.😑< /review>

Great hangout with plenty of dining options. Stopped at Shrimp Shack, ordered the shrimp with grits, shrimp tacos, hard lemonade and mango margarita, everything was delicious.

Laid back atmosphere, definitely a fun place to eat and relax.</text>

<Review>It is a very nice place  especially when you want to get out and try something new! Last night my Husband and I were at the little Greek place ( Basha K.. nooot for sure on the name) and we saw a cheerful group of people all sitting and we couldn't figure out what they were doing until we walked up to them. THEY WERE DOING A GROUP PAINT!!! Not your average grub. Not your average experience! YUM!!!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Would love to come here and eat. Heard it was great and the food is fantastic.
Unfortunately, after seeing a live music post with no mask in sight and no social distancing. Going to have to hold off on coming. Can't support a business that is for profits before health.< /Text>

Great selection of every nationality of food you could possibly want to eat all in one place. And cocktails are amazing from the corner bar Native Son. The outdoor area is great to grab a beer, your favorite food and meet friends. Staff is all friendly and the Food Hall is clean and lighting/ambiance/plants are a great addition.  Love this place, can’t wait to go back.</text>

Great Spot with great food. The atmosphere is fun for a date night or lunch with the family. I have recommended this place to several friends and family, my kids husband and I love it. It's nice to be able to decide what you want to eat even if everyone else doesn't want the same thing. I like that they offer Apple pay and Google pay which makes it convenient when you have teens who want something different than you want. We can all order our food at the same time a lot of the locations have QR codes so you don't have to wait in line, either way the way is not long. Great selection of food. Really cute patio set up with enough seating. If you check out their Facebook page you will find that certain days they have live music or comedy shows.<//review>

<Text>Lots of food options! Why pick one when you can pick all?!

Only negative thing for me is that it's usually overcrowded. But that just shows how good this market is.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< name>

<Review>A lot of great choices to eat if you don't mind spending a little extra. This place does not cater to big families with a lot of mouths to feed. In my opinion they cater more to adults food-wise. It was very clean, and nice ambience. The outdoor sitting with a DJ was a nice touch. Small pets are allowed from what I seen. I will be returning to try something new at this location. It appeared to get more crowded after 6 p.m. and some places were sold out meat like the BBQ stand with the pulled pork. I was told they sell out by lunch time.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Nice place to try different eats, outdoor patio, misters in summer heaters in winter. Native son bar has lots of craft beers on tap and good selection of custom cocktails. Weekend live music and weekday movies. Fun place to hang and chill.</text>

<Text>This place was so cute! We came here as a big group to celebrate a friend's birthday so it was perfect that there were a million and one options - Everyone could find something they liked!

I wanted to try something new so I went with Taiwanese cuisine. I tried the Dan Dan noodles, which has spicy pork and is served with a boiled egg. Though it wasn't actually spicy, it had a lot of flavor and was really good! I also decided to get myself and the birthday girl a drink from the bar. It was the Big Samurai, I believe. I just loved the adult style capri sun packaging haha and they were fairly strong too.

Our group also took advantage of a lot of the dessert options! We got two different kinds of churros and ice cream, crepes with banana strawberry and Nutella, and mini churros with a chocolate dipping sauce. Everything we had was great, the atmosphere was very nice for either groups or date night, and I definitely plan to come back to try all of the other yummy food options soon!</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4yeN6lYWlP-q0OpmEYCDfknwkCgkI3U7ozxbd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c3351592ed31d5:0xdbea509c7612ba35<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Came to get some lunch and try one of their restaurants inside the plaza.
With plenty of parking and easy to find made the visit pleasant.
The plaza has many different restaurants available with a variety of foods to choose from.
Italian food, Asian selections, American food fusions, to specialty hotdogs, fresh fruit juice, boba, and much more. Some photos not shown.

With lots to choose from we decided to go with "JoJo's Kitchen" Taiwanese eats.
We got an order of their Popcorn chicken, Dan Dan noodles, and Beef noodle soup photo not shown.
Everything was good and enjoyed our meal outside. Their service was Expedient and polite.
Then went to Acai Life superfoods and got a watermelon juice drink to go which was delicious and quite refreshing on a hot day. Service was excellent.
We'll have to come back one day to check out some other options in the market place.</Text>

<Text>A lot of great choices to eat if you don't mind spending a little extra. This place does not cater to big families with a lot of mouths to feed. In my opinion they cater more to adults food-wise. It was very clean, and nice ambience. The outdoor sitting with a DJ was a nice touch. Small pets are allowed from what I seen. I will be returning to try something new at this location. It appeared to get more crowded after 6 p.m. and some places were sold out meat like the BBQ stand with the pulled pork. I was told they sell out by lunch time.</Text>< pics>

The first time I discovered this place, I was thrifting at the Goodwill next door. I saw the outside so I decided to go in and check it out. The look and feel is very trendy and cute. Super IG worthy. I've only tried Firewings (which was fire), and another place I can't remember, but I plan to eventually try every place inside there.</review>

We went here tonight for the Taste of Haven event - pay $30 and get 6 vouchers for sampler dishes at the restaurants of your choice. We enjoyed the experience, and it was a neat way to get introduced to the various restaurants and try different options. My favorite was the Baba K chicken shwarma, and my husband's favorite was the Jojo's braised pork belly rice.

However, the items should have mathematically been worth $5 each, but not all of them were. For example, the Vietnamese sandwich from Lantern was tiny, as was the Jojo's pork belly rice bowl. Although the event was a fun way to try the foods, we wondered after if it would have been cheaper to actually buy small dishes at each place, rather than the whole $30.

Also, we were there 5-6:30pm, and Elmer & Jasper's as well as Belly & Snout were sold out of their voucher products. :(</Text>

I've been coming to Haven City Market since it's opening weekend last year. They have a good variety of food vendors to choose from, mostly asian fusion from what I've experienced. It's basically an Inland Empire version of the Anaheim Packing District if you've ever been there before. Same concept of one big trendy place with a bunch of different vendors inside.

Haven City has a real nice outdoor seating area for you to dine out and enjoy the day/evening with some good food. I believe they also do offer movie nights and morning workout classes? Not sure if those are still being offered but I know in the past they have been. Usually during the evenings they have live entertainment in the outdoor area as well.

So far I've tried a few of the vendors: BurgerIM, Fire Wings, Pan Pasta & Ibasa tacos to name a few... all have been pretty good. My favorites are definitely Fire Wings and also Boba time for drinks is the way to go.

I like that they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating because it does get packed on weekends and evenings. I believe they are now open for indoor dining as well so that's nice to know customers are welcome to eat inside (masks are still required though).

Definitely will continue to come back to Haven City because I do really like a few of the vendors they have and the chill vibes!<//Text>

I love this place! There is so much food to choose from and they always have fun little events each week. It's been so boring during Covid but I love the fact that Haven City Market always has something fun to do! They also have a little bar if you're looking to enjoy a cold one after a long week of work. This place will always be my go-to. :)</review>

<Review>I went to order fire wings I ordered the 10 piece and fries and a drink everything looks amazing when I got home I live about 10 minutes away I tried to parmesan chicken wings they were awful greasy and they were dry very dry I was very disappointed so I went on to try the teriyaki chicken wings same thing looks good but tastes awful completely dry I think what they did is they cook and when you order them what flavors they put on them the fries were okay but I will not go back to that place FIRE WINGS!  I paid about $16 and I was very disappointed again I will never go back to fire wings at Haven! Don't let the pictures fool you !<//Review></record>

My mama said there would be days like this, she said good things come to those who wait. All dogs really go to heaven. You are what you eat and I guess I just ate Haven and I was in the city. Such a dope place I mean it should be called Narcos because it’s so dope. I will be back like the terminator or kawhi Leonard</Text>

<review>We went here tonight for the Taste of Haven event - pay $30 and get 6 vouchers for sampler dishes at the restaurants of your choice. We enjoyed the experience, and it was a neat way to get introduced to the various restaurants and try different options. My favorite was the Baba K chicken shwarma, and my husband's favorite was the Jojo's braised pork belly rice.

However, the items should have mathematically been worth $5 each, but not all of them were. For example, the Vietnamese sandwich from Lantern was tiny, as was the Jojo's pork belly rice bowl. Although the event was a fun way to try the foods, we wondered after if it would have been cheaper to actually buy small dishes at each place, rather than the whole $30.

Also, we were there 5-6:30pm, and Elmer & Jasper's as well as Belly & Snout were sold out of their voucher products. :(</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

There's a variety of options for food, and the outside dining setup is really nice, especially if you're looking to gather with a small group of friends in this pandemic.

We had a blast sampling the food and ordering a few beers and boba.</Text>

Each time we visit Haven City we are never disappointed. There's so many different delicious choices you can't go wrong. Shrimp Shack and their shrimp boil is delicious and a must try. Don't forget to give into your craving for Mediterranean food at Baba K their lamb shawarma is delicious!</review>

This actually a really cool place. The aesthetic of a street market mixed with modern eateries. I can see the appeal of it and enjoyed just being there. If only covid wasnt an issue, I could find myself visiting this place more often.< /Text>

<Text>The experience was amazing. There were so many types of food from all different cultures. The photoshoot opportunities are endless. I went with some friends and we each ordered something to share. We had Shrimp Tacos from Shrimp Shack, Lumpia and Pork belly Sandwich from Belly & Snout and some Hot wings from Fire Wings. They were all delicious and I got to try something’s that were new. We ate outside under an umbrella and seats that were sanitized. They took the coronavirus pandemic seriously and it was a clean and social distancing environment. I would go back and try something new.</Text>< user_name>

<Text>I came here the day after the Grand Opening. This place was easy to find.  There are still a lot of people the parking is full. I had to park far away but it ok. There are a lot of food choices. We tried a couple of restaurants and it was great experience. I saw that there will be more restaurants to come. The place is clean. There are public restroom. There is an outdoor seating area and lots of games for kids and kids at heart. I would recommend this place but don't expect it to be cheap.< /Text>< userid>

Great and diverse food court. However, masks aren't strictly enforced and i watched a food service employee prepare poké with his mask below his chin. BobaTime has this drink with butterfly pea tea in it and its amazing.<//Review>

<Review>Good vibes, lots of options. Room for expansion. It looks like new shops will be moving in soon. Fire Wings has 24oz of Space Dust for only $6!< /Review>< pictures>

A bustling hall of food that covers a wide variety of delicacies. I'm sure there's something here that would suit anyone's cravings. The decor is inviting and the inside is spacious, while also offering an abundance of sitting both inside and out. There is also art across the walls throughout that is very cute and sets the mood for the place.</text>

<user_name>Jennifer Law</user_name><rate>5</rate><Text>Great place for new and familiar food places. Not all the venues are open yet but most of them are. The variety is great: tacos, okonomiyaki, sizzling plates, chicken wings, seafood, poke, sushi, burgers, acai bowls and more! There are also dessert shops like bubble milk tea, popsicles and ice cream! It's definitely worth checking out while it's relatively unknown and the lines aren't too long yet. The trickiest part was finding parking out in the front parking lot. There are options to eat inside and there are heat lamps on the outside. A great place if you live in the inland empire and are too lazy to drive out to Anaheim. As an added bonus, there was a live band that did some great covers. There are also places for you to hang out with your friends and family ~ ping pong tables, watching sports and some fun arcade games like basketball and skeeball.</Text>< Gmap_id>

It was 5 out of 10. The place was clean. Lots of empty suites. No indoor seating right now but you can eat outside. There are a few tables with benches. Also most of the places are kinda pricey.  Many dishes over $10. So prepare to drop $30 for 2 people.</text>< Pictures>

A very cool concept like a hip food court but with a bar!  Very reminiscent of something you would find in Singapore.  Tons of options but mostly skewing twords Asian culture.  Dessert options as well, looks like in normal circumstances they have some arcade games. There is a bar with full alcohol which is really cool a really nice outside seating area with plenty of shade and grass.obviously during covid-19 is not at full capacity. I'm sure once things go back to normal this will be a pretty cool Hangout. I only tried one place which was pretty tasty although the prices are not exactly what I would call cheap, the place I tried I kind of question their for the price but it was tasty.  It's def a foodie place.  Worth anotger visit for sure.</text>

Great selection of food, lots of variety for almost anyone to enjoy. It has free ping pong tables, free wifi, arcade games, and a comfortable outdoor seating area. You could spend hours here trying the different food and drinks. Ideal for bringing a group of friends to just spend some hours talking and eating.< /review>

Would really like to see the outdoor patio area enhanced for night use. Overall, an excellent use of a vacancy, and hopefully will be able to attract more business interest to the area.<//review><time>1575268840843</time>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I'm really enjoying the food and drink choices you can get there.

I do have to point out that some workers at certain restaurants don't care about their masks and wear them under their nose, or even under their mouth. And then they brush you off when you request that they put the mask on. I get it, it's annoying, it's hot, but we all do it. Why would somebody, that serves me food, be an exception?< /Review>< pics>

It's finally open!!!
I've been waiting for this market to open for my foodie needs. So far this place impressed me.

Sunday weekend opening was packed so I decided to visit again Monday lunch and it wasn't madly crowded but there were still good number of people.

Here are the food places that are open as of 10/28/19:
1. Acai Life Superfoods
2. Baba K
3. Belly Snout
4. BurgerIM
5. Cauldron
6. Churrobar & Coffee
7. Crepes de Paris
8. Ibasa
9. It's Boba Time
10. Native Son Ale House
11. Oke Poke
12. Oko Yummy
13. ON + ON
14. Popbar
15. Sizzling Place
16. Shokunin
17. Shrimp Shack

Coming soon:
1. HoneyMee
2. Jojo's Kitchen Taiwan Eats
3. Lantern Vietnamese Cafe
4. Pan Pasta
5. Umai Savory Hot Dogs

I glanced at each of the restaurant menus and everything is fairly reasonably priced. Not everything from some menus are available though because they just opened this weekend.

I tried:
1. Belly Snouts' pork belly fries and it was tasty with lots of meats and the fries were crispy.
2. Ibasa's Al pastor and carne asada tacos - they used delicious corn tortilla and both meats were seasoned well... But they didn't have corn yet.
3. Oko Yummy seafood- it was freshly made with lots of seafood. It was good especially the sauce they use.
4. Churrobar's plain churro and one dipped in white chocolate. They were freshly made so it was nice and hot and crunchy. They didn't have ice cream though...
5. It's boba time's Jasmine milk tea was spot on with soft yummy boba.

There are plenty of tables inside and outside which both has their own nice perks:
--Inside: 2 giant white screens where they show NFL games, 2 ping pong tables, some arcade games including 4-player pacman and of course nice and cool indoor AC.
--Outside: play area for the kids, outdoor games including giant connect 4, heaters for cold nights, and fresh air.

I would definitely be back to try more food here.
I'm so glad Rancho now has an awesome foodie market! BUT WHERE'S THE RAMEN AT!?!?!

(Parking is decent size but might be crowded on weekends and dinner time so I recommend parking across the street and just walk)<//text>

<Review>Well done Haven City Market, well done . This place is beautiful at night when all the lights outside are on. Inside is so well lit and inviting, the space is well designed with what feels like a free flowing layout. There are some free ping pong tables that my son and I enjoyed playing for a few minutes while waiting for food. If you've ever had those nights where you can't quite decide what you wanna eat? Well Haven City Market would be a great place to go, you'll definitely find something here to satisfy those cravings.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I've tried a few places here. On + on would be one of my favorite. They have clean and healthy options. I like the outside area. It is nice and relaxing. Some of the food options can be a little pricey. It just like a mall set up but with  FOOD!  Cute place to check out, but in my opinion just a giant food court.</Review><Rating>4<//Rating>< Pictures>

This place is great. They have good variety of food choices. Perfect for a date or family outing, they have table tennis available for free and a lot of seating. I highly recommend this place, it's our new spot. Tried a few of the places in here and their food is great.</Review>

Tables outside were filthy. Good food choices inside, but the way it was designed makes it difficult to maintain social distancing. Some staff at certain restaurants are not wearing gloves or masks (or wearing masks wrong with nose sticking out) when handling food.<//text>

Got our food to go. Place wasn't as crowded as before and free masks were available to those who didn't have. Still a great place to bring family when your ready to join society again.</Review>

Weirdest place ever. It's just a mini mall but just for food
It's a decent place where young people and single desperate Asian ladies take their overly aged rich white boyfriend's to, for them to be more cultured.
Anyways it's actually a pretty decent place for 15 mins then youre bored</Text>

<review>Lots of different places to eat. It seems crowded but its not too bad. Easy to find seating, lines are quick and food doesn't take too long. Food was great, lots of parking too. Great place to visit on a Saturday night with the family or for a date. Oh and there's live music too!<//review>< Pics>

<review>This is such a fun place to grab some great food and hang out with friends! There is tons of open seating, vendor and random things to do. I just know that come spring time their outdoor seating is going to be packed!! Only complaint?? You can't eat here for less than $10. And if you're thinking dessert to? Add another good chunk of change. Not cheap, but oh so delicious and fun!< /review>< Pics>

<text>It was just okay.  I understand the place is still developing but its really hidden and I wouldn't have known about it if I was driving by.  I was browsing through the selection of food and I missed some because of the construction.  Other than that I was alright.

It's okay for a quick bite but if you're looking for something more quiet, this definitely is not for you. There is a bar and open air eatery. Great place for a friends get together. The restaurants are more Asian oriented but there is a taco shop,  burger place and a hot wings joint.< /Review>

Highly recommended. The only problem is parking and how crowded it is, its still new so its really busy right now. But there's a lot of good choices and different ethnic foods. I personally had Belly and Stout and On + On. Also there's an outdoor courtyard that plays live music and a few games to play. If you're interested i would recommend you check it out< /Review>

<text>Its a spacious food lab with several food choices. My son is a fan of Burger IM, my husband goes for the wings at Fire Wings and i try different spots.

Love the variety of food items available!  It's definitely a crowded locale.  That may die down in a while.  We enjoyed what we chose to eat tacos and crepes.  The atmosphere is very energetic, full of people, noise and music.  I only wish there was more seating.  Overall though very enjoyable.</Text>

This place is great! Multiple bars to hang out at and plenty of common eating areas once you decide from an excellent choice of food. Outdoor area has heated and yard games. Perfect for families, quick lunch break, or meeting your friends to hang out.< /text>

<Text>Visited twice so far. Safe, friendly environment. Love the choices, and have yet to run into something I didn't find tasty.

Due to it's popularity, I suggest showing up as early as you can. As the day progresses, all of the vendors start to run out of product.

Otherwise, quite pleased with my experiences and will continue to eat here.</Text>< Pictures>

This place is like Grand Central Market but with a more family vibe to it. It's was the best idea to develop a indoor place  when there is a variety of reasonably price places to eat. It also looks like most of the establishments are family owned, so if your about supporting that, it a great place to be. They also play sports games on a huge projector and had a DJ playing.</Review>

Place is awesome.. All kinds of food from all over.. Seafood boil, sushi, churros, coffee, acai, poke bowls, burgers and famous chef inspired spots.  A must if you are in the area.. They have an outside area for kids.. Outside seating for adults.  Tvs everywhere and games for all to play like ping pong and basketball hoops.. Really fun time.. Check it out..<//text>

It's a cool concept and I'm glad to have this place nearby. I just wish it had an expanded variety, too much Asian food. Not that there's anything wrong with Asian food but too much of the same thing becomes stale</Review>

It's a big hype. A lot of these places are chains, and a few of them are absolutely dead because prices are 3x more than local competition, which isn't acceptable if you have 0 reputation.

Overall, the three stars isn't a BAD rating. Just needs improvement. Strong point is that it's very clean and there's constantly at least one person walking around taking care of trash and stuff.

Suggestion: sound absorbing material/foam on ceiling/walls because it's incredibly loud and almost impossible to have a conversation when everything echoes in the small space.<//Text>

Love, love, love this place!! So many different options on where to eat. I like that the options are different and not your typical mall food! The outdoor sitting area is just as nice and spacious so you are not sitting on top of other strangers!<//review>

Haven City is a warehouse of several eateries mostly of oriental cuisine. I went to check it out not eating at any of the places. There were about at least 14 to 15 different eateries with seating available,  a ping pong table, a full screen tv with seats, a popsicle vendor, ice cream frozen while you wait, Wild Wings, etc. Its a place opened once before Christmas. Family oriented, teens, parents , elderly would love to come mingle and eat. Outside patio seating. I observed a lot, huh?</text>

Great new place in the heart of Rancho Cucamonga. Food choices seem to be of premium quality at an average price point. Good alternative to the usual past food variety. Overall good experience thus far.</Text>

I really want to try the pork sandwich place, the creole place, the burger place, and the wings place. Next time.<//text><username>Craig Lewis</username><rating>5<//rating>< Response>

This place is so cool. There is so many  different types of food.  Baba K was really good. And the ice cream churros. I strongly encourage everyone to try out Haven City Market. I believe there is something there for everyone.</text>

Native Son has over 24 different beers on tap. They have a great selection with rare beers on tap. Cocktail list has your favorite cocktails and the bartenders can make you something special if you don't see what you are looking for. They are open till midnight on Friday and Saturday.< /Text>

<review>For the past year or so I've been passing the construction zone of, supposedly, some place called Haven City Market. I never thought they'd actually finish it or get enough places to rent spots. Lo and behold, it's open. I was excited to see what kept us waiting so long and, to be honest, I'm not disappointed. I quite liked it actually. The Chipotle style restaurants with a variety of food types ranging from Mexican to Asian fusion looked cool, unique, and new. In addition, there are plenty of dessert and drink options like boba, beer, cocktails, etc. The aesthetic is industrial mixed with plants which I'm into. I especially enjoyed the "backyard" where you can sit outside and enjoy the weather.  Overall, great experience (especially with the food from On-On Fresh Asian) and I look forward to trying some other places out.< /review>< pictures>

Great variety of food options! For being a new facility the bathrooms we surprisingly dirty to my standards and the floor was sticky in more than one location.  This is our second visit since they have opened. We went on a Wednesday night and it was not extremely busy.   Our first visit my daughter got sick at Burger IM, it was opening weekend and places were running out of food, it could have been mishandled food with a new place getting slammed so we went again tonight and so far so good.  The wings place and shrimp shack were both tasty, I also tried cauldron which was extremely filling.  Churros are better than waffles in my opinion.< /text>

Great variety of foods here, great place to take your kids. I personally loved the adobo fries and calamanse drink. Kids loved the churros and ice cream. There were also ping pong tables and a open area for your kids to play outside.</Text>

Place is awesome.. All kinds of food from all over.. Seafood boil, sushi, churros, coffee, acai, poke bowls, burgers and famous chef inspired spots.  A must if you are in the area.. They have an outside area for kids.. Outside seating for adults.  Tvs everywhere and games for all to play like ping pong and basketball hoops.. Really fun time.. Check it out..</Review>

<review>Very disappointed with the lack of ethnic diversity at the Market Place. A dominance of Asian food and Asian vendors even if they were not selling Asian food.
Our culture is moving to a more inclusive environment and the market place didn’t reflect that.</review>< user_id>

Rancho Cucamonga finally has such a food mall like packing district @ Anaheim. I love the diversity of food here. You can have Americans burger, Mediterranean kabob, Taiwanese braised pork in rice, Japanese okonomiyaki, etc here. And the place is clean with lots of seats. Unlike packing district at Anaheim, the parking lot is big so no worry about finding a space. There is kid playground outside of restaurant area. And there is table tennis table inside which is fun. If you like watching some major sport event. They have projector tv broadcasting games. The only thing is to get more restroom. I don't think one for men and one form women is enough< /Text>

<Review>A lot of foodie selections. I had some dan dan noodles that was a bit spicy,but it was excellent because of the cold day which lay outside. I also had a watermelon boba which gave my taste buds a rather expressive feeling of relief sotheness. There are coined basketball courts to shoot competing to get high scores. There was a boba milk tea stand for various types of milk teas. They have seats outside to lounge. Many pizza options are also available in the city market. This place is at a great location in Ontario. Parking is available almost everywhere,so there's no problem with that,a lot of access. This is the first time I been here and hopefully the chain keeps on going.</Review>< Rate>

BurgerIM is the place. Great burgers, fast, friendly service and a generous Veteran's discount. Definitely stop by and see them.</text>

A lot of foodie selections. I had some dan dan noodles that was a bit spicy,but it was excellent because of the cold day which lay outside. I also had a watermelon boba which gave my taste buds a rather expressive feeling of relief sotheness. There are coined basketball courts to shoot competing to get high scores. There was a boba milk tea stand for various types of milk teas. They have seats outside to lounge. Many pizza options are also available in the city market. This place is at a great location in Ontario. Parking is available almost everywhere,so there's no problem with that,a lot of access. This is the first time I been here and hopefully the chain keeps on going.< /Text>

<user_id>109945475079281859780< /user_id><Review>It's different than what we were used to as far as a food court. The outdoor eating area can't be beat.I would return just to sit outside. Doesn't have the hustle bustle of the mall so that was nice. I'm not real big on Asian food so the selection was not the greatest for me. I opted for Burger IM which was delicious, but the portion size was laughably small. I could have eaten double so for 8 bucks a burger not including fries and drink I'll probably just be headed back to In and Out. I would have given five stars but the selection of restaurants was just not for me. Coming from the supersize  era, gen x'ers will not be impressed. Happy Grubbing.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>This place is a food and fun experience in one building!  There are burgers and fries, poke, crepes, a churro bar, dessert bar, an actual sports bar with adult only beverages, a ton of asian fusion foods, a superfoods spot, healthy asian spot, crab and corn on the cob, burritos and Mexican food, ice cream, and multiple flat screen TVs with sports running, awesome music tracks playing, ping pong table, mini bowling and basketball games, and a ton of places to eat indoor and outdoor. During summers they hold live band music on the patio and Special events.  The outdoor patio has both concrete and grassy areas to sit and eat and there are plenty of opportunities to meet new friends you sit across from during your dining experience.  The parking lot is big but always packed so go early! Handicapped parking is also available for those in need. The building and outdoor patio are  wheelchair accessible but the doors are not automatic so some assistance needed there.  Food prices are pretty reasonable and service is typically quick if you don't go at lunchtime for the local work force from 11AM to 1PM; parking is better too before and after the lunch rush Monday through Friday.<//Review><rate>5< /rate><user_name>Tess Reid</user_name></record>

It is not bad, but just pricy. If the food/drinks here can lower down 1 to 2 dollar, it would be a great place. But for now, it is super midiocore w.r.t the price.< /Text>

<Review>This place is an awesome addition to Rancho  Cucamonga!!!  I highly recommend checking it out. There are lots of little cafe style foods inside the market place, along with boba, coffee, desserts, even liquor! They also have ski ball, pingpong tables, and an outdoor recreation area. The only downside is having to choose which spots to try first!!  We ate at the Happy Bento next door (sooooo good!) And for dessert visited the market place for delicious coffee and VEGAN churros.  We will definitely be back and I am excited to take more of my friends/family here!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< GmapID>

We waited for a year a more for it to finally open and...its just ok. I live right up the street so I will continue to visit and support small, local buisness but they have to strp up there game. Lunch truck, gourmet prices minus the gourmet. We need some more street tacos!  BTW...they did a nice job on the interior and patio area.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Haven City Market is a popular food court located in Civic Center Plaza, rancho Cucamonga. They have so many options - nitro ice cream, salad bowls, churro in ice cream, sushi, tacos, BBQ and so on. This is the place where you go with the group of friends who all have different tastes. Everyone walks away happy here.  All the ingredients are fresh and the food is tasty. The price of the food is very reasonable. They have sufficient seating (both indoor and outdoor) arrangements though finding a suitable place for parking is challenging when you get there. However, this place has enough entertaining food options for even the pickiest eater.<//Review>

Lots of good options, esp for those who can’t figure out what to eat for lunch. Does get fairly busy during the lunch hours and parking is shared with the dentist office.< /review>

<review>Great selection of food and drinks. Some of my favorites places is native sons for drinks, &coffee for coffee, Churro Bar for churros, Firewings for wings and BabaK for Mediterranean food. These 5 places have become a staple of my diet. Finally Rancho Cucamonga has a awesome place to eat and hang out. If I was to dock them some points during busy times seating is hard to find.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Some of my favorites places is native sons for drinks, &coffee for coffee, Churro Bar for churros, Firewings for wings and BabaK for Mediterranean food. These 5 places have become a staple of my diet. Finally Rancho Cucamonga has a awesome place to eat and hang out. If I was to dock them some points during busy times seating is hard to find.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Haven City is an awesome treasure in the area! Hip location with a variety of eateries that are individually unique. Lots of seating indoors and outdoors.

Pros: variety of good food
Cons: indoor seating can be dirty<//Review>
