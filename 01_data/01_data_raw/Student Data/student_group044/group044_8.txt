<Text>StorAmerica was pretty clean. Looks safe enough I suppose even though where our storage is it's narrow back there. I've only been there in the day so I hope there's ample lighting.<//Text>< pictures>

Unfortunately I wish I had something better to say about this local business. I have rented before from another company in Hesperia and when I moved  to Victorville decided to try this company because of its location nearby. This was a mistake. I reserved the storage unit online because the website said there was “no obligation” and that I could come in and finalize the signatures and contract. The website also said that the first month was no cost just a $29.00 move in rate.

So the same day (Friday) I went in and spoke with the manager who was nice. As we were reviewing the contract she stated the cost due and I advise about the online pricing. She took a moment to review the information and then confirmed that I was right and the monthly price of $149 would be due the following month in March. We proceeded to sign the contact.

I then came in 3 days later  on Monday (I would have come earlier but they are closed on Sundays) and advised that my father in law did not need the unit anymore and we would need to cancel. I first offered to move to a smaller unit but none were available. I said even though we did not move anything in I understand that we have to pay the $29. But the manager stated we would be charge the first month fee of $149. I reminded her about the conversation we had before I signed and she stated that she made a mistake when she told me I would not be charged until March. Unfortunately she is the manager and I will have to wait 6 days to find out if I would be issued some sort of refund and 6-8 weeks to receive anything in the mail.

She admitted it was her error and yet I will be the one that has to pay the price for her mistake. No accountability. Poor customer service.

There are plenty of other storage units in the HD that would like mine and your business.< /text>

{'time': 1612298916107, 'text': 'Dear Kathleen,\nWe apologize for any confusion or miscommunication that may have occurred during the move-in process. We do offer a $29.99 move-in special for our new tenants, but due to the limitations of our online rental system, and depending on what day of the month the tenant rents online, this promotion may require manual adjustment on the backend. In this case, the $149 you paid online would have been credited for the following month, minus the $29.99 and the prorated rent for January 29th through January 31st. The District Manager has been made aware of the situation and has approved a full refund for your move-in costs. For updates on your refund, please feel free to contact the office directly at savvlamesa@guardiansc.com or 760-241-7974 and our team will be happy to assist you.\nRegards,\nManagement'}< /response>

Ashley and Juan were very professional in helping me with my storage needs. Friendly and personable. The rates were a little higher than other places I priced but the location and overall attentiveness they displayed was the deciding factor. They seem willing to listen and show a sincere desire to make my moving a little less stressful. Thank you Ashley! I will absolutely recommend this facility to anyone looking for storage needs! 😀👍</text>

< review>
***UPDATE JUNE 2020***
(STAR RATE INCREASE from 2-Star TO 5-Star)

Upon reaching out to Management with Stor-America, we came to a reasonable rate. I am EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE for them extending this courtesy to me.  The interactions with staff and Kimberly, the Mgr. have been consistently professional and kind.

THANK YOU STOR AMERICA for providing a long-termer like myself a decent and safe storage.

This facility has undergone many changes and endured some hardships along the way.  Over the course of my ongoing tenancy here, they seem to be coming onto the upswing of their business. So glad they have found some success through these very challenging times.  WORTH SUPPORTING LOCAL businesses, like this one.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

(PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW)

Moved into this nice storage facility in March 2014. The staff was very accommodating and professional.  Juan, Ashley and another gal whose name I sadly cannot recall all were so helpful in the account setup and move in process. The introductory move in special made it possible to choose this location hands down for affordability and convenience of location.

LOVED that they offer a Free truck for moving in, it really made the whole matter very stress-free! THANK YOU for making me feel very welcome!

Fast-forward 5 yrs, Mgt. has changed a few times and increases have happened annually.  I can understand to a point why this happens, however as of July 2019 the rate increased from $87 to $102 for a 5x10. (And that is without the additional insurance, which I had to cancel due to inability to afford the extra $10 monthly fee)

I wish to remain a loyal and devoted customer, tho it has vastly become a burden to meet these rates. Can only pray they could work with me on keeping my storage affordable.< /review>

<Review>This is my first time renting a unit at a storage, StorAmerica Self Storage is a great place. Very clean and the personnel and extremely helpful and friendly. I recently had to go in to open my unit, I lost my keys to the lock and Juan was nice enough to help me cut the lock. Most of the times I call in to make a payment Juan answers with a very friendly and positive attitude.

I've had a storage unit for business here for six years.  When I first came, Juan and Anita were running it..  Overall, it has been a very safe and secure facility.  During the construction of the new overpass, Anita, who was the best customer service person around, always took care of me to make sure that there were signs and arrows so that we could work around the construction and get to our place.  Sadly, I recently found out that Anita is no longer there.  And that became apparent, because the place did not seem the same, however, Juan came back and I'm glad that he did.  He is outstanding in meeting any needs.  I emptied one of my units our recently and his staff worked with me to get everything checked out perfectly.  When I'm in the office to make a payment, I hear Juan on the phone and he is always caring about the customer's needs.  That assures me that he will take care of me if there is ever a problem.<//text>

StorAmerica on La Mesa are now charging me $190 for my 10 x 20 unit!!! This is BS!!! 😥😣😭      I was paying $160
WHY I ASKED?
They bought more storage units around the area. I didn't buy more storage units around the area but I have to pay for them.
Who pays $190 for a 10 x 20 unit??
I called around and for a 10 x 20 unit and the highest is for $139 the lowest is $90 a month.
For the rent to go up $30 more a month is WRONG!!!!
I will go somewhere else soon like Bear Valley storage for $120 a month (10 x 19)
My bad Juan your great, you love your job but everyone else that works their don't!!

To the owner of StorAmerica Self Storage, your very wrong in charging $190 for a 10 x 20 unit and raising $30 more a month👹👹👹😬< /review>

If you had contacted the store on the Property Manager’s day off, then the acting Manager would be more than capable and happy to initiate your lease and get you settled into a storage space. We regret to hear that the timing didn’t work out for your needs.\n\nKind Regards,\nManagement'}</response><GmapID>0x80c36612b38fada1:0x59dbf2812da375e8< /GmapID></record>

ATTENTION anyone looking for storage.  i put my belongings in storage at StorAmerica and within six weeks my locker was broken into and my things taken.  I thought my stuff would be safe, they have a gated facility, with cameras and people at the front desk,  yet someone drove a u_haul type of truck into the facility ,  cut the lock off my locker and proceeded to rob me.  Now the whole time someone in the office watcher the hole thing and got it on video so there is no doubt about what happened.  a police report was made for insurance.  Foot draging by storamerica and a refusal by there insurance co.to live up to there responsibilty has prompted me to write this review.  i have been lied to on several occasions about the status of my claim and gotten the  run around. I WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE UPDATES UNTIL THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.  Beware of StorAmerica, your stuff is not safe there.</text>

<Text>Terrible customer service and security. My storage unit was broken into by someone who had a code to get into this supposed secured and monitored facility. I was told by the manager that there was footage of the vehicle that broke into the storage units that night. That's right, I said UNITS. Apparently the security at this place is so lackluster that the criminals had time to break into multiple units. The manager then lied to me 4 weeks ago saying that my insurance check was in the mail on its way to me but surprise surprise I never received it. I call up the manager two weeks ago and confront her only to be told that it had in fact not been sent and that the insurance company was still in the process of reviewing the claim, after almost 3 months. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place.</Text>< pictures>

Rate increases are customary for the storage industry, as growing operating expenses and increased competition must be accounted for.   With that said, we would like to work with you in getting you to a more comfortable rate. Please feel free to contact the office at Victorville La Mesa and the manager can help negotiate your rate on your behalf. We hope to keep you as a customer and we thank you for choosing StorAmerica for your storage needs.   Kind Regards, Management'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

So I’ve never gotten my nails done before  I got a manicure and a pedicure and it was the best experience. My nails are beautiful I wish I could remember the names of those who help me but they were the best. One of them was a man with tattoos on his arm and the other was this woman with semi short hair that was on the red side. So if you see this thank you so so much ❤️✨</text>

Came in for a pedicure. Worst experience. The lady that did my pedicure cut me three times. At first they said $18 for a pedicure, but when you sit down in the chair they charge you extra for anything else. $5 extra for some callous gel and a sponge to scrape it off. Didn’t remove any callous what’s so ever. And when I mentioned that and asked for a callous removal tool to be used on my foot, the owner told me it was “illegal” for them to use anything other than a sponge. What a load of B.S. paid $23 for some nail polish and three cuts on my toe. Wouldn’t recommend.< /text>

<Text>I got my  acrylic nails done here twice already and I’ve never had my nails done so horribly. The first time I got them done at this nail shop they did my nails sloppy, the powder they use was all lumpy underneath my nails. The second time which was yesterday I got them done my nail broke just by picking up my phone. I don’t not recommend coming here.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2c9163b64415b:0xcb43fc918a3ea37e<//GmapID></record>

I like all the ladys who do the pedicures but the one who do the acrylic nails dont do a great job. The only one who actually does do a good job is the one who collects the money. The rest do a okay job.<//Review>

I had to wait forever, finally I get seated for my french manicure...and the lady was very rude, she acted all exasperated...and gave me the worst manicure EVER!! Lumpy polish...crooked lines...just horrible, she just rushed the whole thing and produced a sloppy french manicure...my five yr old niece could have done better.

<Review>Worse experience ever... i never do reviews, but went in, to get mani/ pedi and my acrylic was lumpy the nail polish was thick and didn't go on smooth...
The worker tried fixing it a few times. Instead of it being a pleasant experience, it turned out to be very stressful. And time consuming.
Hate this place, never going back! Zero stars if I had my way!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Terrible experience. I went in to get a gel manicure and the lady doing my nails did a horrible job. First she get mad at me cuz I tell her that two of the nail need to get fixed cuz they had some little balls sticking out she tried to fix it and made it worst I tell her no I don't like it she tryst again and makes it even worst so I tell him no I'm sorry u need to remove the polish and do it again she get so mad that she starts to talk in her language to another lady. Then she is mad the rest of the time and trys to get me out of her sit asap. It's been one week since I get them done that the polish is falling off already. I won't be going back ever again for that type of service and treatment.< /Text>< pics>

This place has horrible service..... my mom and I used to go there but we stopped going because they are really rude. My last experience there was HORRIBLE I told the guy that I wanted medium coffin nails and he's didn't even ask me where should he stop cutting he just cut  and cut and he did them super short and the shape wasn't even into a coffin shape it was in a  triangle shape and then when I told him that this wasn't how I wanted them done and can he please take them off and redo them he started catching an attitude with me so I started catching one back and he started talking in Chinese and he started snatching my hand  and screaming at me  because I told him to not to be snatching my hand and he was still catching an attitude so I FORSURE got my butt off that chair and I told my mom that we need to leave now and we haven't gone since. This happened on Saturday and how is a grown man going to be catching an attitude and screaming at a 16 year old that's out so I don't suggest you guys come here because this experience was the worst experience I have ever had</Review>

(Translated by Google) Every day the service is worse in this place, they do not respect the time they give you an appointment, they will make fun of each other with their language, they do not value the client, they hurt you and simply Sorry, I continue to hurt you, I have been a customer for years but now if they are very M at your service

1st and last time coming here i usually go to pico up the street but wanted to try a new spot boy oh boy did i pay for that!Ordered 16 piece of catfish steak and got maybe 3 pieces of steak and the rest was a mystery??A couple pieces had the texture of a pork chop!SMH...Wont be going back for sure and i drove 30 mins to try them out,I see why pico is higher priced atleast they give you what you payed for 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂 (Look at the pic if you know fish you know those are not catfish steaks)<//Review>

I remember coming here around 6 months ago or so. Wanted some fish. Searched online and found this place
Never had been here. I read reviews and said it was a good place to eat. Parking lot small and crowded. Inside,  receipts from other customers all over the floor, only 2 couch benches in there and tv on wall. Ordered my food. Took 35 to 40 mins to get it. I was mad but took food home. Fish wasnt good to me. Seasoning very bland. Mac salad...will just say it was not for me. Wont be going back there. Im good</text>

The fish is really good the young lady that helps at the desk is very sweet and down to earth she treats customers like family she treats you like shes known you for years. The fried chicken used to be really good but I dont know if they have a new cook but the chicken is not that good but everything else is 👍<//text>

< review>
This is the best fish market in Long Beach! I want to give 5 stars, however, I believe customer service experience plays a part in ratings so I cannot give a 5. When ordering my food over the phone and coming to pick it up I feel rushed and as if the person on the other end is snappy and rude. This has happened on 3 separate occasions. I am the type of person that no matter how good the food is or the product is if you don't know how to treat me, then you don't deserve my hard earned money. My husband absolutely loves this place which is why I haven't cut them off completely. On the flip side I love, love, love the banana pudding. Disappointed in the service though, especially since I get the sense this is a Christian establishment.</review>

I waste of money. I spent almost $9 on a Fish lunch that wasn’t seasoned. The fish and fries had no taste, plus I only got 3 pieces of fish. Also, I was denied the use of the restroom because it no longer available to paying customer l.</Text>

Easy to find.. they have sign board for truck entrance, follow that sign. All dust area. If product is ready They are fast when you got a dock, otherwise you know produce shippers. Check in lady very slow. Take your food with you or order uber eat 😂. Restroom near truck entrance gate.<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>NEGATIVE 10 STARS:  Horrible excuse for a cooling/shipping warehouse.  Typical wait is 4-6 hours just to get to a dock, then another 2 hours to load 8 pallets.  20 trucks in the lot and they load 1 truck at a time.  Obviously they don’t care about the trucker being on a strict ELD time limit and running out of hours sitting there just waiting to load.

Terribly managed.  If I could give negative stars I would.  Sick of this place.  I am biased because I worked at a well run efficient cooler.  They need to find a new manager that actually knows what they’re doing and cares about the image of their company and the trucker.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80d75a6449695447:0xcd0ed31a6a435ef7<//gmapID></record>

The restrooms for the truck drivers (the people responsible for transporting their goods /making money for them ) is every bit of inhumane. The inmates in prison I’m sure have better/cleaner restrooms than this place and it’s flat out WRONG because no one in the office I’m sure could be paid enough to use the public restroom they have for us truckers ! Shame !!!</text>

This is a produce storage cooling place. Well organized. Numerous signs to truck parking lot, which was marked with red cement circles embedded in ground as a guide. Quick in and out. Watering the property to keep dust down.Friendly professionals from clerks to loaders.< /Text>

Notoriously unresponsive, unhelpful, and horrible attitudes from shipping personnel.  This cooler is the bane of my work life, and the talk of my office.  On top of that, our drivers hate going there.  I don't know if they are understaffed or if management simply doesn't care.< /Review>

I had the nicest lady cut my hair and she took her time. No rush job. Don't you hate it when they rush you in and out? I got a discount for a special they were running and the quality of the style was really great.< /review>

The place is good. Good customer service and clean. I don't know who controls the app time for this location but it's not very accurate. It said a 5 min wait but when we got there, there were a handful of people already waiting.< /text>

<text>Cool haircuts two times in a row by different stylists, wait time is not too bad ~25-40 min for walk-ins. I liked how the queue is organized and shown in the screen so you have a rough idea about how long you need to wait. Staff is friendly and you can occasionally find discount if you are regular at the nearby Safeway behind the bills. Thanks Laila for the awesome haircut today. Currently the price is 17$/cut, and sometimes discounted rates are available on weekdays between 1 pm to 5 pm.
I tend to have bad haircuts often but this is a welcome change.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1570567406009, 'text': 'Thank you! We look forward to seeing you again next time!'}</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>I recently got a haircut for my daughter. As soon as she came out of the parlour she started crying seeing her hair. I told the stylist clearly just trim the hair, I don't need a boy cut. Even in between told her many times not to cut too short. (As my daughter is trying to grow her hair) She did not understand what I told. Even If I want I don't think my daughter would ever go back to that place again. Sorry this is the first time I am giving a very bad review and it because of my daughter's crying.<//Text>< date>

After approximately 8 times visited, I have had a similar experience each time. I appreciate a hair cutting place that has consistency even when you have different hair dressers. I usually go for a trimmed comb over that I style messy. I have not had a complaint yet. I will be going again. My Wife also has had a few hair cuts here and all 3 times were positive experiences for her.< /review>

I came here several times before and have received pretty good haircut and service. Today, I experienced such blatantly rude treatment to the point where I felt mortified.

They seemed busy and overwhelmed with 10 people on the waiting list displayed on the monitor at the front (people making appoints online). I waited till the hairdresser (first time seeing her there) to call me up and asked her how long my wait was. Although there were 10 names in front of me, she said she can cut my hair right away. Being confused, I nicely asked her again to double confirm. That's when she started raising her voice in short temper hurrying me to sit at her station. She started cutting my hair in a rudely hurried manner ignoring my direction. She was hurrying and pretty much bumping her electric razor to the back of my head. A minute into it, she walked away for a few minutes suddenly answering a call in the backroom. She then came out with saying a single word of apology or excuse. I was on the verge of walking out of the salon half way then. I suppressed my frustration and decided to wait till the end.

The hair cut was much shorter than I would have hoped. I was at the verge of refusing to pay and complain. However, I didn't want to embarrass myself by risking making this unpredictable and rude hairdresser lash out.

I will never come back to this place again. A terrible quality control and mgmt. This store needs to realize that most of their clients are local and repeat customers. They also need to train their employees to be able to communicate better in English. You don't need to be proficient at speaking fast. However, you must be able to listen to requests or at least have the patience/decency to clarify what you don't understand. My family will not be back here again. Horrifying.</text>

Sometimes I get good haircut, sometimes it's bad. Sometimes stylist are good, sometimes very very rude.

I've been going to this place for last 3 years now, once every 2 months. Overall I would say I got good haircut around 50% time. But my experience is getting worse & worse over last 4-5 visits. Today's visit culminated my frustration. Stylist was very rude, hurriedly finished my scissor cut is less than 4 minutes and overall finish was pathetic. Every time I thought let's take one more chance at this place but not anymore, I'm not finding it worth the price.< /text>

The stylist was very nice. However, when I looked at my credit card bill I found that the gentlemen that checked me out added an extra tip that I didn't authorize. I tipped my daughter's stylist in cash for a reason. I'm very displeased.< /text>

<Review>I got coupon fro $5 off, they said their machine wont  read online coupon  from iPhone. I received the worst cut in my entire life. There was a Old Lady she  don't listen to what you want. She ruined my hair style, Avoid this place. I will not recommend to anyone!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

Frankly they suck at cutting hair. My hair is always left with different lengths at the top. I have to go home and fix all the long pieces sticking out here and there.< /text>

Came here as a returning donor (had stopped coming in during Covid-19) and was told i had a flag on my profile from 6 years ago back when i lived in a different state. Why was this not taken care of 3 years ago when i started donating here??
Anyways, agreed to do a sample to remove the hold. My phlebotomist missed twice! Then they told me they had run out of needles and I had to choose between using a large needle on the vein that has been poked twice, or come in a different day.
Sorry, but I am never coming back!
Definitely not recommending this place to anyone. Don’t let the great rating fool you. This place USED to be good. Not anymore.
The only reason why I was compelled to write this review was because the rating truly does not reflect the way donors are treated.< /Text><username>aryssa torabi<//username></record>

<text>Terrible! Do not give this business your business.  You lost me as a return customer today. I will not recommend you to anyone. I have been a plasma donor for years. Be consistent and I highly advise you to retrain your front desk personnel on being more confident in providing reasoning for turning away long time donors.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< name>

They need to allow new donors to make appointments or have a specific time window when they should show up. My husband has been rejected 4 times with half the reasons being they didn't have the staff to process a new donor at the time we arrived. It takes 2x as long to process a new donor over a repeat so I'm not sure why they wouldn't do appointments. (Also if you make it that difficult on people, no wonder they have to beg for donors.) Other than that, the staff is nice and the facility is very clean and well maintained.</text>

<text>Saving lives matter. ... very good professional employees for the most part... there's one employer that's very rude her name is SERA she's very unprofessional rude with the patience.
Now Victoria is very kind professional she took the time to look around and notice that I was still waiting to be process she,immediately got my folder and take care of me and got me in the back quick.Very kind of her.we need more like her. Now SERA needs to learn from Victoria on how she takes care of her patients...she's very unprofessional rude and she likes to argue. A while back we had an incident with my wife in the parking lot.my wife was parked on a parking spot SERA came and park behind her.when my wife was trying to leave SERA told her with an attitude  you shouldn't park there  We end up talking to the supervisor that day he must have just talked to her I came back and she was still working here I don't expect for for someone to get fired over that but if it continues and there's a history of her having attitude she should not be working behind the counter you need to be very professional when you're behind the counter.< /text>< Pictures>

Biomat is top of the line in everything including professionalism, service, attention, and great humor!! They make you feel very comfortable and genuinely care about you. You can actually call them friends! I've done if the a type work in auditing and this place is right on target and appears to be very compliant.

I've been donating plasma for decades.
Nation wide.
The San Diego Grifol Biomat management and personnel are SECOND TO NONE!!!!
The friends I've enjoyed for years at the La Mesa location are far more than just  highly trained medical professionals,
Their caring, personable attitudes towards the donors as well as their co-workers is why I look forward to donating twice a week for years now!</Text>

Nice staff except for bearded fat Hispanic guy. State Something wrong with my labs. I did my lab regularly at the VA and results came nothing abnormal. This is probably happened to some people. I have a feeling that some shouldn't be donating here. Others that are healthy have thier results botch or switch and disqualified. I just donate to the red cross when I can. I recommend that to everyone Red Cross does take Plasma and blood and saves lives. I understand financial needs and they seldom will treat people like destitute. I hope they can change the laws where thier pay is beneficial to thier donors.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I truly enjoy donating plasma at the Biomat Center on El Cajon Blvd. in El Cajon. Everyone there is very professional and well trained. The facility is very clean and organized and you can earn a few extra dollars while helping others.</text>

<text>I thought the way I was treated was incredibly unprofessional and just weird. Asking me to take off my shirt and wanted detailed information on scars and "prove" the dates of tattoos by photos on my phone and then threatened to be permanently banned from donating plasma because I couldn't prove through pictures. They stabbed me multiple times and instead of telling me oh we can't find a vien try again tomorrow they just stuck me and ultimately put on a temporary "ban" for like 50+ days because they couldn't return my blood to me. Then they wanted me to drink a whole bottle of gatorade which I have an allergy to red dyes. I expressed that and they tried to tell me I couldn't leave without drinking it. Honestly the whole experience was weird and I would recommend octoplasma instead. I just don't think taking off my whole shirt so they could "inspect" my body was necessary.< /text><gmapID>0x80d956e5f6c9dbd5:0x8f51f47506cafe26</gmapID><Rating>1</Rating>< pictures>

The employees have been kind and helpful to me overall and I appreciate that. Wait time has been fine, 2-3 hrs is what they list on their website and it’s never taken me over 3 hours. Drink lots of water if you want your donation to go faster. The bathrooms have been clean more often than not. The interior of the facility is a little outdated but I wouldn’t let that keep me from donating.<//Review>

so , my problem is with their appointment system. for example,  i have a 2pm scheduled appointment.  i show up at 1:55. the front desk says i cant check in at the computer kiosk until they tell me. i wait almost half an hr before they call my name. so, now its 2:30 when i begin the screening process.  the reason is because donor wait times are recorded from the time the donor checks in at the kiosk. they have these TVs all over the center displaying wait time stats like they have wait time standards and goals, but by not allowing doners to check in at their scheduled appt time , they are intentionally manipulating the wait time data and disregarding donor's time which they should be compensated for.this has happened to me well over 20 times . i think its dishonest and shady. i have brought it up to several employees and they straight up admit that they do that to keep their wait time stats down. #1 factor in donor's compensation is the amount of time the donation requires.<//text>

It’s been all well and good for me so far until today when I was waiting in the lobby for my husband to finish donating. It isn’t one of my days so therefore I was minding my business in the one corner, working on my laptop. Even though it’s hot outside, they made me leave because they were closing the doors... They’re lucky af that we have a vehicle I could attempt to stay cool in- I’d be really ticked if we had taken the bus over here as we had in times prior to today... Not cool at all.<//Text>

This place has people with no experience, It seems as though I always have to have two people touch me, When this should only require one  person,  the last time I came. I had too come back in to get my payment, then today, after showing the text message, I still had to call back for the bonus. They need to hire people who know what they are doing</Review>

Very poor experience for first visit! Called ahead, told them was NEW donor, asked if open till 2pm, they said, no 4pm! I checked again, told same thing. Drove over, in the rain, only to be told i needed to be there at 1pm for new donors!! I said i called first and instead of apologizing, the  staff became rude. I asked if I could at least fill out the paperwork, and was told no, against their policy . Was also given incorrect info about mail with address on it... has to be PHYSICAL address ( i have a po box due to my profession) very dissatisfied with client service!< /text>

This place is an excellent facility. As a retired RN I am picky about clinical procedures, efficiency and cleanliness and this place delivers on all three. I have found the staff compassionate and patient in an extremely busy environment. I feel totally comfortable in donating at this facility, by far better than others in the area.<//text>

From the start they made me feel uncomfortable and they were very rude.   I was made uncomfortable from the start they throw papers and videos saying to watch this and sign this. There for a hour signing consent forms before they told me I can’t donate because of my piercing is less than a year and when I said well why would you have me sign a whole bunch of consent forms and read this stuff if I am not qualified. She says well I can “defer you permanently then”. And I said well after this I won’t be coming back and the girl stormed out of the room.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Was so close to getting to the 8th donation but they lost my chart. I didnt lose my chart, they did. No compensation for my last visit due to their incompetent staff. Definitely will not be coming back.

My suggestion to the readers, if you think this is remotely close to being a stable income, think again. When (not an if) they lose your record, they wont get any sort of repercussion, no, its you the donor that will. Think about that before you come to this location.</Text>< pics>

I've ALWAYS had a pleasant experience with the staff here! They really work hard at keeping the wait time to a minimum.  EVERY phlebotomist is phenomenal! From the the beginning to completion,  EVERYONE is kind, considerate and professional.  The facility is always clean! I HIGHLY recommend this location for your next plasma donation!!!</review>

Poorly trained and over worked staff. Supervisors (e g. Brent Noriega) and corporate fail to act on complaints. According to Biomat S.O.P. phlebotomist are to stop the machine when blood goes into plasma bottle. During first cycle blood dripped into the bottle, I advised the phlebotomist she failed to stop the machine. It then went into second cycle and I was deferred for 8 weeks due to her negligence in failing to act. On another occasion after the 8 weeks my phone wasn't allowing me to set up an appointment. I called and advised them. I told them I was 12 minutes away. Then said they had two openings and to come. When I got there they wouldn't see me despite calling prior to and driving. Supervisors and corp failed to disciple and take corrective action and measures on my complaints. Contacting medical board and BBB. Then legal action<//Review>

The wait times are ridiculous, plan on being there for at least 2 hrs... the staff are always complaining about other staff, and seem to be overworked and understaffed. The pay is ok, but considering how much they get for it and how rough the experience is, they should pay more!</review>

Usually dont have any problems the staff( today alex male skinny with glasses was very rude) is more or less helpful but for the last few appointments ive had ive always been on time however the appointment system is so stupid that i still end up waiting over 45 mins to be screened and sent back today i arrived for an appointment at 5:30 only to see that there was one screener and people backed up until 4:45. Not screened or used the kiosk . Then you find others who don't follow directions and go straight to kiosk get to cut in line .  Its extremely unfortunate that they dont have to wait . Please tell me what is the point of scheduling an appointment when you wont honor it or have the same rules across the board . Update it is now 6:32 a WHOLE HOUR (I've been sitting in the back for 20 mins)  after my SCHEDULED appointment and the rn Danielle usually very helpful today was short and rude . They blame “New management” for 99% of problems ive always found if you like your supervisor 9/10 the employees will be more inclined to work and work hard .  Moral of the story YOUR APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING SYSTEM SUCKS ! and your employees are becoming more and more rude .  You have your employees irritated because they are always out of “ratio” overworked and under appreciated and your donors are suffering as a result of it . I should not know your job drama as much as i do but these last few times as i was waiting and average of 45 mins after an appointment  to be screened i couldn't help but pay attention . 6:41 and im still not on a machine . You should also know when a donor asked about the tvs he was rudely told to sit down and that we arent allowed the tvs or music because they need to focus . This is unfortunate considering its the least you can all do especially if we are waiting this long to be stuck . Sarah whos been here for 2 months is about to stick me . Lets see how this goes . SPOKE TO SOON sarah is not going to stick me she just set up the machine it is now 6:50 and i havent been stuck . WOW JUST WOW also just overheard that out of the 6 phlebotomists you had scheduled today 2 showed up and one was for a morning  shift .  And theyre having a debate about sick pay and how many chances you get after youve used them all . In regards to missing work ALL OF THIS IS REAAAAL GREAT TO HEAR AFTER IVE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER AN HOUR AFTER A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT . Britni stuck me at 7:00. A WHOLE HOUR AND THIRTY MINUTES LATER britni was amazing she apologized after she seen how long i was waiting and had great bedside manners . I have to give at least one star for this review to post but i give yall a half<//Text>

<Review>Great Process of collecting the Plasma, clean facility, and super helpful and friendly staff. The wait time is the worst and everyone’s reason is they are “understaffed”. 20 minute wait to see screener, 20 minute wait to get escorted to a bed, and another 20 minute wait to actually start donating. Hire some people or do something cause the wait time is almost not worth the compensation<//Review>< Pics>

It’s my first time and last time trying to donate plasma here. They Wouldn’t except my w2 as a proof of  social Security number. I even printed out my whole tax return from TurboTax and nothing. Talked to management and said they need a “real” w2 and not the one I was providing them which I got from my job to file my taxes. Other than that service was awful, everyone  was standing in the front but no one was doing anything or helping anyone out. DONT COME TO THIS LOCATION OR EVEN THIS A ESTABLISHMENT<//Text>

I donated for years and was diagnosed with mental disorder, told them about and said it's fine. Then they flipped out when I told them about it again and told me not to come back. So be careful if you go here.< /Text>

Got kicked out forever today after complaining to management of my second intentional infiltration in the past three months. I have been donating at Grifols for the past almost 14 years pretty much twice a week. After having nearly 1000 donations I am kicked out for accurately calling an incompetent and negligent employee to management;s intention. I would stay as far away from this center as possible If I was a potential new donor.</Text>

If you want to spend 3 1/2+ hours out of you day to be treated terribly once you actually get to donate then come on down to biomat. The majority of the workers there always look unhappy. I would suggest going to one of the other facilities in San Diego or don't donate. They feel as if it is a privilege to donate rather than being happy people go there to save lives. Hope this helps anyone considering coming here.<//text>

I will give this facility 5 for being clean.Most of the staff is knowledgeable and very nice. BUT!...one bad apple can spoil it for the bunch. Its very uncomfortable to come an environment and before you get there you are hoping you don't get a women named Lupe, Because she may be having another one of her bad days or she bluntly stares at you with such a mean face. she makes me not look forward to going to donation. Lupe is always using her authority to speak to co worker unprofessionally and RUDE.  Lupe badmouths her teammates to donors and tells donors how she is so better than everyone there, its just so inappropriate. Team leader should build there co workers esteem up and work as a whole.! it really does take a village.

I have been a donor for 3 years never had a problem till last week. I have been misinformed with this company who blindly did not want to own up to their mistake.
Just letting you If you have been away for less than 5 months you will not get renewed donor fees. You have to be at least 6 months or they will dupe  you. DO NOT LET THEM FOOL YOU THAT YOU ARE A NEW DONOR ASK ON HOW MANY MONTHS YOU HAVE BEEN AWAY. The way THE MGR OF THIS PLASMA CENTER handled their customer service on their MISCOMMUNICATION WAS HORRIBLE!!! I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS SPOT AGAIN!!!< /text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Biomat USA provides some great service.  The staff is very friendly and understanding when it comes to the needs and wants of the donors, they have a wide variety of movies that they show to keep people entertained, and I really enjoy the fact that donating plasma puts money directly and instantly onto a prepaid Visa card.
The only complaint I could make is that they get pretty busy some days.  So much so that they sometimes make mistakes.  I once waited an extra 20 minutes in the lobby while they skipped over my name, but when I stepped to the counter to them they had no problem realizing there goof-up and bumping me to the head of the que.  Other than that there is nothing I can really knit-pick at.

If I could I would give this a 4.5/5 or a 9/10, but google wont let me.</Review><Name>nate guioguio<//Name><user_id>112752488351038041276</user_id>< gmap_id>

<Text>The worst experience I've had with any medical facility.  I went there to donate and to help people, and they lied to me multiple times.  I had to go back there 2 days in a row, wasting valuable time and gas, and they just lied to me again.  Horrible, inept staff - they don't know what they're talking about.  Avoid this place, they will waste your time and money too!< /Text>< user_name>

I would give no stars if possible due to the fact that I called ahead of time to make sure military ID paired with SS card would fly. Of course, they said yes, or why else would I be here? I drove 40 minutes just to waste my gas and time. Thanks Biomat San Diego.< /text>

So today I walk in this facility for the first time previously having donated before on other facilities this one is by far the worst experience ever at a donation place . I walk in the place is full and I said I was a second time donar so a worker told me with a rude tone go to the kiosk then I go and I can’t sign in and she says in a very rude tone that I can’t donate on both centers at the same time which was something that was not told before . I thought it was rude of her part because her tone was rude and disgusting and the name of the employer who treated me rude when I asked a simple question is Marina thanks to her I will never be coming back to his facility and everyone should be ready to be treated rude at the front avoid this place overall.<//review>

<Text>Professional center in Ogden, UT. They said prepare for 3-4 hours on first visit and it was just shy of 4 hours as they expected. The phlebotomist's were well trained and genuinely cared, because I watched one lady call 3 regulars by name without their file.</Text>< user_id>

It was ok experience the first time, but never donate because I weight less than it should be. Women got weight more than 115 pounds and more. Guys more than that to pass and donate plasma. But overall the staff and experience was ok. Movies play there. But not sure if kids are allowed inside.<//text>

The money is crap for your time, last resort place.
They profit from your body, bullshit.
A lot of doners look like current drug addicts
Also forcing you to drink a cold poweraid when the place is freezing or you won't get paid is completly insulting.</Review><user>113702317437520005531< /user></record>

Worst place ever. I was deferedeported from donating because I could not tell them my address. I live in mexico and I am american I do t speak Spanish and I can't read it. I already gave them proof of my address. Did our know they sell your plasma for 1700 dollars as of 2008. And probably even more now. And pay you 25 dollars they also allow homosexuals to donate and it's a violation of federal law to do so. Every day they have to ask if your ever even 1 time since 1988 had homosexual sex. And then the very obvious homosexuals are donating increasing the risk of spreading aids and hepatitis. Also not permitted Are drunks and drug addicts. But look around and you will see them also. They don't pay fair in fact they pay 25 dollars for a bottle they sell for 1700 dollars and they lie. They say it's for the benefit of kids and old people but the plasma being paid for can not be introduced back into the body. Only donated for free can be. This can be found on Google as well. Now the plasma is sold to pharmaceutical companies for experimental medications. They lie to us. The plasma industry is a 12 billion dollar a year industry and this corperation is in Switzerland it's not American all this money is going out of usa. They are criminals crooks liars.< /text>

It's Taco Bell. The staff was friendly & helpful. It was extremely busy at the drive thru & they got a change & extra wrong on my app order, but given how busy with only 2 employees it wasn't a big deal. Everyone was happy with their food.< /text>

Bad customer service. Place order on the app for a quick pickup and took longer than placing it at the store. What’s the point of the app if the people working there ignore the app orders<//review>

I like the service...My only complaint is when I say yes to taco sauce I ask for only a couple of mediums and when I got home I found 25 hot sauces...I hate throwing them away...Can't be good for their bottom line<//review>

< Review>
The $5 box is a solid deal for these days.

I take small issue in the nonchalant and almost careless nature of the cashier. I asked for a root beer, she gave me pepsi. And she also forgot to add sauces, which is like, somewhat essential to the meal, no?

Anyway. It's alright, maybe it wasn't the best day.< /Review>

Very close to our house, we tend to frequent it more often than other taco bells. Sometimes their taco meat tastes off, or they're super greasy. But its fast food, the people are super nice and my order is always right.< /text>

Very slow when it comes to ordering by the time you receive your orders it’s cold. Definitely wasn’t worth the 40 minutes I waited in line< /Text>

I haven't eaten at taco bell. But the service was top, all smiles and nice staff. Orders taken quickly and processed quickly. I might be wrong here maybe it's like that at all taco bells. But I ordered a 5 layer beef burrito. And I didn't taste any beef. They didn't give me the wrong thing but that brown processed pastry that's supposed to be beef doesn't taste much like beef.<//Text>

Disaster. Wanted a 7 layer burrito and a bean burrito with sour cream . The bean burrito  didnt even have sour cream and the 7 layer burrito had hair in it. I took a bite out of the 7 layer burrito and a hair came out of it. I put the hair on the burrito and i went back to the counter to tell them. They had a little conversation in the back and called me a lier that how can a hair be in the burrito. Its a long hair i told them i dont have long hair i have short hair. The lady gave me the most stupidest answer ever. She said in her words: how can a hair be in the burrito.  Im a 16 year old teenager  guy i am gonna tell all my friend that go here never come  here  again. If i vould i would give it -5 stars< /Text>

Taco Bell will save your life if you are on a very low budget. They're variety of seasonal $5 boxes are amazing and even come with a drink, which you can have free refills if you dine it. Some of them are very tasty. My favorite is the $5 Cravings deal with no sour cream in the burrito. It is amazing< /review>

<Review>Service was slow, I orderd 5 tacos and 5 burritos I, ate four of the burritos, myself one had onions, one had cheese, one had red sauce and the fourth taste like burnt beans, I gave away the fifth burrito and the tacos I fed to my dog. The next day. My dog was sick. I remember when Taco Bell was a 4 or five times a week choice for me. What a dissapointment. Hopefully it was only this store.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< userid>

Nothing against the employees or the food. Want to grab a $5 box that they advertise. It was actually $5.99 here</Text>

Just built from ground up with modern landscaping and better quality interior design. Drive thru service is fast and efficient. Super friendly staff always smiling and attentive.< /text>

I have been here numerous times, dine in and drive thru, and they seem to be short handed. Yes they are friendly and smiling, but the service needs attention. Food is great but working on getting orders needs to be addressed.<//Text>

<Review>I've been to this location several times the food has always been done fairly quickly except the last two times I don't know if they're short-handed but it seems to take longer than usual a couple of times on the drive through and through the dining in section of it they took a little bit longer than most of the time dirty clean Taco Bell.< /Review>< pics>

They forget a lot of things like change receipts food. Sometimes they are just not paying attention at all. Some of them have bad attitudes. No phone number listed either .<//Text>

This doctor almost gave my dad the wrong medication. He didn’t even bother to check his medical history! After my dad told him about his conditions he went to check. What kind of doctor does this? DO NOT COME HERE! Also didn’t want to give him his prescribed medication!! It’s all about taking your money!!
Este doctor le iba a recetar a mi papá medicamento sin revisar su historial médico? Que clase de doctor no se fija que enfermedades tienen su paciente? Este doctor solo roba dinero. No vengan aquí!< /text>

Very bad service especially the doctor I work in the medical field and for him to tell me I needed to get Labs, Injections, and Medicines to be done all in the office or nothing. Trying to steal your money ! I have insurance so there is no need for me pay for everything and plus for the reason I was going didn’t even require all extra stuff only reason I was there it was late and couldn’t see PCP that day. So he didn’t even let me choose or talk what I wanted to be done. He will cut you off and tell you all mad its Everything or nothing and walks out on you.
DONT GET FOOL FOR 20$ consult
And the rude staff don’t even know what they doing. I should of read the reviews before stepping into the office. They are a rip off!< /Review>< resp>

Doesn't even deserve one star to be honest. Dr. Sweeney is among one of rudest people I've encountered to date. Won't ask how medication is working, how it's effecting me daily. Clearly only cares about pumping out the same prescription everyone seems to be getting..curious (Venlafaxine) Guaranteed I won't be returning, don't bother unless you want to wait for half a day for horrible service.< /text>

The doctor a fraud he lives off of the ignorance of the Hispanic people and he has clearly capitalized on it, I had to wait exactly 2 hours everytime I visited this clinic wich was a total of 3 times. I went in with a physical trauma to an interior part of my body that was causing me a blood infection and high blood pressure among other issues such as anxiety. This doctor took as much money from me as I possibly allowed him too! He never diagnosed me correctly and I know because I was diagnosed by global medical on Bristol st that's how I put this thief to the test using all his sales and scare tactics to keep me on his medication and blood test with no positive results! This place should be closed down and his license revoked!!!</Review>

The doctor is so unprofessional, completely rude and has a habit of kicking the patients out with any due consideration. If there were a way to revoke his license that would be a great thing for this city! He should not be considered a doctor. If I could out 0 starts to this review I would.<//review>< Pics>

He made me feel so comfortable. Yet I felt I was treated like family their concern for my well-being was genuine. I would go back in a heart beat if any sickness comes back since their prices are accommodating .< /text>< Pics>

This place doesn't even deserve a star.

I was seen today by a dr sweeney. I waited 3 hours patiently. My work insurance hasn't kicked in and with a UTI, I couldnt wait to see a doc. When the doc came in the room, he asked me about my symptoms and if I suffered from anxiety and trying to dismiss the reason I was there, like, First off, that's not why I'm here....he started saying he didnt believe I had a UTI but he would give me antibiotics.  The MA came into the room to tell me what he was prescribing and I asked why I needed 2 shots of rocephin along with oral antibiotics.  I told her that was unnecessary. It's either one or the other. She went and told the doc I was refusing treatment and he came storming into the room saying that I  could not pick and choose what medication i wanted. That i had to take all or nothing. I stated I couldnt afford all the meds he was recommending and he stated "I'm not here to resolve your financial situation and that's not my problem." I told him I was not gonna take anything that was not necessary and I walked out. Please dont go there, if you dont have insurance.  There are other options. This doctor and his clinic are just ripping people off and stripping them away of their dignity and  charging them for services they dont need.<//Review>

<review>Worst clinic ever! I when in for consultation due to the fact i had asthma, i saw the doctor and agree to get injections and neb treatment. I ask the "MA" for a prescription for the meds she stated "that they dont give prescription since they sell medication at their office, that if i want a prescription i have to come back and talk to the owner of the clinic a male doctor name sweeny" (whos is not even in town) So basically they force ppl to take the treatment at their office. All they care about is MONEY! Every other clinic ive been to they give prescription, they never denied a prescription to a PATIENT. This is the first and last time i come here, never going back! I dont RECOMMEND this clinic, if i could give a zero star i would.< /review>< date>

Honestly this is by far the worst I’ve been treated at a clinic. The doctor I think his name is Swenny was extremely rude and disrespectful I don’t know how someone can treat his patients with such disrespect. He is just something else. Anyways horrible experience and won’t be coming here ever again.</review>

I will not recommend this clinic at all; Especially that they want to force you to get the hold treatment and lie to you about the prices; they don't try to help you out the nurses only want to charge you high prices: I found it really strange that the doctor cannot give you a prescription note; not authorized ;they toll me you need to come later to see another doctor ; if already saw one; I could verly understand here; i was sad that my son needed to witness all that:( definitely not coming back<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Clinic remedy for all venlafaxine and if you have diarrhea or any other problem the first thing you need to do is the covid test costs $ 145 in 15 minutes this list, will it be robbery? When it takes 10 days for hospitals to give you the results, for several years treating me for the same problem and nothing, today the doctor got angry because I did not want to do the covid test, he got angry because I asked him for an antibiotic for the daily and I I don't know, "I answer if you don't take the test I can't work with you"

Then he gave me VENLAFAXIN and ALPRAZOLAM medication that would help me according to that. Well, lie never relieved my pain. I went with another doctor that if I speak with the truth and help me with my problem. BE CAREFUL THIS DOCTOR GIVES YOU DRUGS FOR ANY PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE

(Translated by Google) Hours are 9:00 am to 9:00 pm on Wednesdays.
Arrive at 8:10 pm and they did not want to attend to my daughter they told me to come back tomorrow, for me that means unethical, but obviously not for them.

El horario es de 9:00am a 9:00 pm en miércoles.
Llegue a las 8:10 pm y no quisieron atender a mi hija me dijeron regresa mañana, para mi eso significa falta de ética, pero evidentemente para ellos no.</Review>

(Translated by Google) It is the worst clinic they are thieves I went to the consultation and the doctor was very rude he ran me from his clinic and he did not give me the prescription only because I did not want to buy the most expensive medicine, with them, I asked at the pharmacy outside the cost was 3 times cheaper and he said that he will leave me and never come back, that he has little education and professionalism, I don't know how to call someone like that doctor,

(Original)
Es la peor clínica son unos rateros yo fui a consulta y el doctor se porto muy grosero me corrió de su clínica y no me dio la receta solo xq  no quise comprar la medicina carisima,con ellos, pregunte en la farmacia de afuera el costo era 3 veces más barata y me dijo que  me largará y jamás regresara, que  poca educación y profesionalismo tiene no se como se le  puede llamar médico a alguien asi,<//review>

(Translated by Google) The service of the staff apart from the doctors is very bad, the ladies in front of them spend their time criticizing and laughing at people without any respect or professionalism. Today I had to wait 3 hours for my nephew of months to be treated at the end I had to go since they passed it at the end of the list 2 times, Miss Fernanda Soto very unprofessional and rude. Management: how is it possible to have someone like that representing your business? What a shame!!!
The doctors are very good but if this continues the clinic will be a failure.

(Original)
El servicio del personal aparte de los doctores es pésimo, las señoritas enfrente se la pasan criticando y riéndose de la gente sin ningún respeto o profesionalismo. Hoy tuve que esperar 3 hrs para que mi sobrino de meses fuera atendido al final me tuve que ir ya que lo pasaron al final de la lista 2 veces, la señorita Fernanda Soto muy poco profesional y grosera. Gerencia: como es posible tener a alguien así representando a su negocio?? Que verguenza!!!
Los doctores muy buenos pero si esto sigue así la clinica será todo un fracaso.<//Text>

<Name>Angel Elizalde</Name><review>(Translated by Google) They are a ball of thieves, they believe that they help people by charging them, $ 25.00 dollars for the consultation. And they are forced to buy the medicine they are prescribed for more than $ 100.00 dollars. And if you don't carry full money, they don't give you the recipe to buy it elsewhere like at Walmart. And they get annoyed if you ask them for the prescription, in addition to being a patient treatment, the most degrading part of the customer service staff. Please do not recommend that place is frustrating. Your service.

(Original)
Son una bola de rateros, hacen creer que ayudan a la gente cobrándoles, $25.00dollares la consulta. Y los obligan a comprarles la medicina que les recetan.por más de $100.00dollares.  Y si no llevas dinero completo, no te dan la receta para comprarla en otro lado como en Walmart.  Y se molestan si les pides la receta, además de que es un trato al paciente, de lo más denigrante por parte del personal de atención al cliente. Por favor no les recomiendo ese lugar es frustrante.

Get ready for 60 minutes of torture on the chat help. It is nearly impossible to talk to someone.

<Review>Took a while for a home install, but well worth the wait. The tech was extremely helpful and polite. He went above and beyond to make sure our install went as planned. He even called customer service to get our install fee waived, since we were pre-existing customers. Internet is super fast.<//Review>< Pictures>

Sometimes staffed by ONE (staffing issues, Comcast?) surly, rude and lazy kid, beware if he's on duty that day. They're also closed for lunch every day , M-F for an hour, and closed on weekends. The techs, installers and phone reps, however, are all great to deal with. If they'd just fire that kid, it'd be a lot nicer to deal with the store.</text>

I recently had Comcast Internet installed at my fathers house and was very happy with the service.  the only reason for 4 star was the install window they promised on the sign up was a 2 hour window but as soon as I committed to the order it became a 4 hour window.  The installer was helpful and efficient.  The service is better than advertised.  So far so good.< /Review>

Great to know that there is a cable TV/internet company that understands what customer service is.  I went in fully expecting to get little help with my internet problems and I expected to walk out after having to cancel my TV service.  I did walk out fully satisfied that I will continue enjoy TV and internet service.</text>

Wish I could give a negative.  I was sold a package via Comcast online.  They swore it would be available in Ukiah area.   It is NOT what was installed.  Not even close to the same channels or features...yet I am paying the same price for old equipment, poor service and features and channels I'm not getting.   I've wasted countless hours on the phone with their worthless customer service who are completely unaware of what is actually available in this area.   The girl in the local office could not be more rude!  Clearly this is an issue they run into everyday and is completely fraudulent.   Comcast simply does not care who it screws.  DO NOt SIGN UP FOR A PACKAGE ONLINE< /text>

In addition, Comcast ,for which I had set up for my elderly mother, gave her a faulty receiver which malfunctioned. When  discovered this and returned the receiver, the sales person said," yes, we know this model is defective". And yet  had not replaced it earlier at  their own initiative. Deplorable company. As of today I have spoken with customer service and they insist that they cannot find my account and deny the looting of my bank account.

I really wish i could give them a better rating cause comcast by far has the best / fastest internet out of all the palces around here. Unfortunately comcast is a giant corporate buisness that is profit drivin above all else. They give you a cheap price to start out but then just keep raising and raising the price. You can even call and change to a cheaper plan and within a couple months they will raise the price of that plan.< /Text>

At home complete service along with cell phone down, as our cell phones are thru micro cell / Comcast internet, therefore no cell phone service either. A female rep from Comcast attended my call on 09/29/15 PM and assured me of fixing the problem immediately. Unfortunately, no body fixed the problem, no body called to show up to fix the problem. I guess, it is simply a joke to Comcast reps, and indirectly discouragement to their customers to move on with a feeling of who cares @ Comcast!! After waiting until noon 9/30/15 called in to Comcast again, got another surety of some one contacting me with in 30 minutes to take care of this issue.. I hope I do not have to call Comcast again to have this problem taken care.< /Text>

<Review>I have placed orders for internet service twice. The first time a crew arrived and said there was not enough signal strength at my location and it would be two weeks. I never heard from the company again.

The second time a contractor arrived, said the same thing and told me he would submit a report and I should hear from comcast within two weeks. I have not heard yet.

The company has been next to impossible to reach even publishing an incorrect phone number on a web ad for the Ukiah office.

The contacts I have made are with distant representatives who promise to file a report and then leave me waiting again.< /Review>< pics>

Well, I went in to pay today and they asked me for $80. I said No and I came home and called.  They told me that they hadn't changed it because I was supposed to have called back to say I had payed the past due of $80! ARRRGH.

planned move with plenty of time.  Comcast said the box was down and it had to be repaired by other people.  Today I move and have not been able to get through by phone or computer and haven't heard from comcast.  In short with even plenty of notice you can't do a simple job.  My service goes off today and I will be left with no phone, no internet, no TV.  I'm going to find some one who actually provides and not just Checks the box.  Ha there isa real world  not just this virtual one.

really angry customer.

<Review>Comcast has a service drop hanging in my backyard with a loop of wire  waiting for a kid to swing on it or hang from it .  I visited their Ukiah office on June 26 and placed a service request, two weeks later there’s been no remedy and they’ve not called to tell me why.   In order to get updates on why it’s not been fixed , I stopped by their office today but they closed an hour early....sorry for the inconvenience.  Another office visit and was told a supervisor will call you.  Four business day's later.....crickets.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808164de5730862d:0xcb473d5d65fb1d39< /GmapID></record>

<text>Convenient Big Lots location that stocks all the goods in the South Bay. One gripe if I may; many products don't have pricing which is annoying and helpful at the same time. If they put price tags on their products, I'd likely spend way more. So, their lazy policies are actually saving me money. Yeah,,, that's the ticket I keep telling myself ;)< /text>< pics>

Big Lots is a great place to buy over the counter meds,kitchen,  bathroom and  holiday decor and spices.
Some things are a bit pricey, and not worth it ,but there are many great deals. The staff are kind and helpful.</review>

We came from the Biglots east of em.

Ours was busy and out of stock.
They said they'd call this one.

Our Biglots waited 20 minutes on the phone for them.  They never answered

I called this store.

They hung up on me mid sentence.

So we head over and, low and behold,

The store is empty with only 3 employees
And not a lot bulb among them.
Hour wasted.</text>

I would give 5 stars but there's been 3 different times  where I walk in and the staff are nice and friendly expect the black girl. She has the worst attitude I usually feel welcomed but once I see her my whole mood gets thrown off. Last time I paid with her and said thank you cause it was the 1st time I seen her and she didn't smile or say your welcome. Fire her  . I'm not the only one who's felt this way. Why have someone work there when it looks like they hate their job.</Text>

<review>Nice, in a small shopping center next to the 99 cent store to the right and the upscale Thrift  store to the left. The store has top quality items that are cheaper than regular stores. The store even has furniture, dog food, cat food, house hold items, snacks, and much more. Sales Associates are very nice. Good place to find good quality Nick knacks at affordable prices. Check them out. Located on PCH.<//review>< Pics>

It's been this way for years, probably as far back as when it was Pick n Save, so I have no hope that they will ever do anything in terms of hiring more employees to help facilitate the lines.<//Review>< Rate>

Good deals.  But the line is usually long.  Yesterday it went pretty fast but that was unusual.  Deals not always worth the wait if you have little ones in tow.< /Review>

<review>I think the woman who rang me up was named Mali, at least I hope so cause I wanted to shout her out for being so kind. Maybe it was Mari. I'll be back because of her service alone! Such an angel.  Awesome food prices as well. Big lots is kinda pricey on some stuff but that's the way of the world now. Can't say I don't miss PIC N SAVE, though!</review>< response>

< review>
The cashier was rude. I came up with one item. The price didn't seem right. I told her I thought the prcie was different. She sat there looking at me wanting me to pay the price on the screen. I asked her if she was going to do a price check. She then huffed and rooled her eyes. Like I was bothering her by asking her to do her job. I will not go back to this location.</review>

Always find good deals but the parking lot is always sketchy. Today there was a couple vagrants outside pulling pants up and down. Um, really? Please keep your parking lot safe or you won't have customers. When we left, we drove around the back of store to avoid traffic and it appears there are several people living there. I probably won't be back as I really don't feel that safe.< /Review>

It's a big job to keep a store filled with so many diverse items neat and presentable.  The ladies who work here are very friendly and welcome you when you go in. There's a quirky guy who works in furniture who may seem grumpy at times but in general he is very helpful if you just ask.
I find so many deals that are much better than big box stores and get my daughters art canvasses here and some school supplies throughout the year when other stores are out or simply too expensive.
If you live in Lomita or in South Torrance shop where you live to keep the stores we enjoy open.< /review>

They have some really cute things at the Big Lots in Lomita on PCH. I didn't give 5 stars because a lot of the things are on the expensive side.</text>

They are a want to be Walmart/Target type of store. Some things are priced reasonable and other things are a little bit pricey. This is the only store I've ever heard of where you can't use your store credit card online. Only in the store.<//text>

For a cheap store full of junk this one is in better condition than the other stores. I come in and wander every couple months and usually find a deal.<//review>

<text>It is a lot cleaner than before. It was always cluttered and sloppy looking inside. Now one could walk around looking for the items without an obstacle course in front of you.

Prices are reasonable.<//text><gmapID>0x80dd4a691f85f3db:0x3c1709e24480d9e9</gmapID>< Pics>

Good store for odd convenience items but you can find the same items on sale for cheaper. Some of their seasonal items don't have a good enough discount for me...<//text>

< Review>
I have gone everywhere looking for a Christmas tree on sale and couldn't find one. My mom suggested I call Big Lots Lomita, which I did. The sales rep Octavio was so polite and kind. He helped me look for a Christmas tree and kept it on hold till I got there. When I got to the store, the other sales reps were very kind to me. Octavio did this seamlessly. Octavio is a great asset to Big Lots Lomita and thank you Big Lots for hiring wonderful sales reps at the store. I will be shopping here more often in the future.<//Review>
