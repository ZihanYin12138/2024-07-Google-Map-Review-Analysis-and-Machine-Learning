Food Poisoning. Had to be from the sausage. The pizza didn't taste very good but we ate it anyway. Big mistake.  It's not cheap either. Jakes Pizza and Pizza My Heart is delicious. This pizza is dog food.  We wanted to try it because it's the closest pizza place to our house. Big mistake.< /Review>

You can call in your order, order it online or use Doordash for this location.  Any of these means is easy to use.  Never had food late from here, always made to order.  I don't think they have a heated warmer to keep the pizza hot before pick up, just a padded bag.  Place is clean and staff is polite.  They have a few tables if you want to done in with a few TVs running.  Haven't had a parking issue when I visited, place is easy to spot from the road.<//Text>

<Review>Via Mia is our ONLY pizza place. My family, friends, and I have been ordering from here since they opened. They NEVER disappoint!! I owned a pizzeria for 10 years in San Carlos,  CA...and they blew us out of of the water. Whether it's take out, or delivery....they are are always the best. Don't bother with the rest, this is this is the go to place.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Reliable, delicious delivery pizza. The Pepperoni Blast pizza has the crispy, spicy joy of the kind of pizza you’d eat in your childhood. The specialty pizza menu is enormous, meaning you can always try something new. A variety of other options, including salads, wings, and calzones, means it’s easier to build a menu the whole family will enjoy.<//review><date>1614532732801<//date>< resp>

Long-time favorite, mostly because they have artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes (which can be difficult to find pizza toppings) and pesto sauce (which not every pizzeria has either). Good quality for the price.< /review>

The all meat pizza is the best. The pizza does not make you feel bloated unlike some of the franchised pizza shops.

With that said this is definitely a pizza only place, the chicken wings were really bad we had to throw it away.  This was not the first time I've got chicken wings even the last time I got it was equally bad. They know their pizzas but that's it.< /Text>

<Text>We are regular costumers. We love this pizza place! The menu has a nice variety of the best pizza combinations and also salads! We usually order to deliver and it arrives super fast and warm!
Staff is always friendly and very patient with clients, specially over the telephone in which can be some words lost in translation but they make sure to take the order right :)
I'd like they send more salsa and ketchup on big orders, I never asked for it so probably they will be able to do it if I request it.<//Text><Time>1552882259263< /Time>< UserId.>

The pizza is consistently delicious, comes with tons of toppings, and is always delivered hot (very important) and on time.  Unique combinations of toppings as well.

This is one of the best pizza places in the South Bay.< /review>

The crust was baked just right, and the amount of mozzarella was just right on my Veggie pizza.  The toppings were fresh and ample.

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>New to the area. After looking at the great ratings  on Google and yelp I decided to give this place a try. I ordered a large combination. I loved the flavor of the sauce, and fresh toppings. This place in my opinion is better than round table or mountain mikes. Decent price as well.</text>< Pictures>

<review>They have amazing service and some of the best Pizzas I've ever had. I've been to many different Italian pizza joints, but this one hits the ball out of the park, both because of the authenticity of the taste and because of the amazing service from the owners.

I can't recommend this place enough to all my friends and family! Check them out, you won't regret it.</review><rating>5</rating><resp>{'time': 1510945289315, 'text': 'Thank you'}<//resp></record>

Quick pickup service (the pizza is ready in 10 minutes or less). Consistent, delicious taste. Cheerful owner. Seems to be a big basketball fan 😀. Well-lit, safe parking lot.< /text>

Pizza was okay. The garlic crust contained most the flavor . Was a delivery, gave me one parmesan packet and one pepper packet. That's enough for one slice..not a whole pizza. Hook a brother up with some packets!!</Review>

<text>Decided to try this place tonight based on the mostly positive reviews, and the available delivery. What a disappointment. Delivery was pretty fast, but the pizza was not much better than frozen. Generous on the pepperoni (though low quality), skimpy on the sauce, and the crust was a little tough. We also got an order of wings that are barely edible. The sauce on them was almost nonexistent. They were extremely rubbery, and had an unpleasant, but slightly familiar off taste that we couldn't quite place, but would most closely resemble the smell of slightly rancid meat that's been in the fridge a little too long. My wife and l each managed to eat one, but we will not be eating the leftovers.  I also ordered a meat lover's calzone, which wasn't bad, but nothing I'd order again. We're sticking with Pizza my Heart.< /text></record>

I love this place!
The pizza is always hot and really delicious(especially the crust). The greek salad is great, very fresh, and I also like their calzones.
You can tell by the taste of food if fresh ingredients are being used, Via Mia obviously does. Their food is consistently good, delivery is always fast, and they have great customer service.  Highly recommend.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I ordered four pizzas for pickup on Sun 1pm, and had a friend pick it up.  It was a deal from a coupon, 1 large specialty and one large 1 topping that included a 2 liter coke.  my friend was told the coke didnt come with it, then had to wait till 1:20pm for the order to be ready,and was told he was getting the coke as a compensation for the delay!  Not only that, they mixed up pizzas and gave me a Hawaiian when i ordered bbq chicken, and no one liked it (it was mostly pineapple, not appealing)! They also messed up the order last time I bought from them a few months ago, also switching a pizza.  That is called sloppy business.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I order pizza from Via mia  sometimes in Saturday afternoon after my sons soccer team games, they have Halal meat. The pizza is terrific. they have wide range of choice, I would prefer to order the combination pizza that includes mozzarella cheese, salami,pepperoni, mushrooms, lingiica,peppers, black olives, italian sausage and ground beef.
also they have another pizza called All Meat, they add all meat toppings with vegetables.

The service was fast and the team are friendly. the only disadvantage for me is they closed a good location in Santa clara (due to a fire in the plaza) the older location was better than the new one and off course closer to my home.</Text>

<text>Just a random reservation and we literally had the best dinner and service in Santa Monica.
I don't often rave about salad but I swear everything was picked that morning!! The entire staff was "your waiter" they knew and could intimately describe every dish and every wine. Order your pasta and let them pick your wine. They actually ask the few questions and pick something you'll love instead of their favorite. We are only visiting here for a week but are booked to return. Thanks!!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Superb place. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. We had crabcakes, mushroom risotto, lobster ravioli and some wine. Everything was cooked perfectly, the risotto was spot on. I took more photos, but just go, plenty of outdoor seating! We will be back.</Review>

Order the tasting menu for some of the appetizers. See second picture. If you want to treat yourself to some rich, and very curated, authentic Italian food this is your best bet. Very respectable wine catalog. Don’t expect to spend less than $100 usd on a bottle of wine. The Italian waiter who served us was exceptional and added facts and creative descriptions to the dishes we ordered. Dress appropriately.<//Review><response>None< /response></record>

<review>This was one of the more unpleasant dining experiences I’ve ever had. And I eat a lot. The waiter was extremely impatient and made us feel quite unwelcome, the Food was somewhere less than mediocre, and the price was quite high for the value. Food is probably my biggest expense item, so I wouldn’t call myself cheap, but this was a waste.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>lucifonseca05< /username>< gmapID>

Went back here for dinner on Friday night . They don't have the yelp waitlist but gladly it wasn't that busy .  The host said it would take about 30-45 min which it did . More like 30 min . Outside you can find nice clean area with chairs to sit and wait. It is nice considering you're in DTLA , you don't want to be wondering around the streets.</review>

Sublime balance of flavors and texture. Mom and I deeply enjoyed their flawless execution of eggplant parmigiana (epic), wild arugula salad, Dover sole, gluten-free vongole, and black truffles over homemade pasta. Italian food this good if very, very hard to find.<//Review>

Hands down THE BEST Italian Restaurant In Los Angeles possible the best that Ive had period.

I love food, I love Italian food, family is Italian, travled to Italy (Rome, Florence, Venice etc)  This is some really really really great food.

The place is very romantic, great for an intimate dinner.

Owner is very kind, and genuinely a nice person. Family owned.

Wine selection is fantastic.

Everything I have ever had here was just amazing, pure joy. The flavors are bold and savory. Everything from appetizers to desert.

Very authentic and magical</Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I've loves in LA my whole life. I've never had an experience as bad as this one.  An hour and 15 minutes in to our dinner we still hadn't gotten our food. when we asked about it they lied and said 5 minutes. 15 minutes later we were told ttackstar truth by one waiter that they had lost our meal ticket. they offered literally nothing. then when when the food came half the order was wrong.  At that point I asked for the check and they had the nerve to actually bring  a full bill. My friends meal was average. I ended up saying no thank you to waiting for them to cook my food and having to wait longer. Honestly, SKIP this place. Go to Capo, Giorgio Baldi, or Scopa. The food is better. The service is MUCH better.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2bace1d2a445f:0x3f9a1fb54c8e9ca6</gmapID></record>

This cozy Venice gem transports you to Italy.
Fully staffed by local Italians who help to create a knowledgeable immersive experience. I'm always impressed  with our servers and how unpretentious and friendly  they are.
If you are a wine lover you can discover both amazing new and old world selections( check out the super tuscans) on there extensive and thoughtfully crafted wine list.
Try the grilled octopus salad or beef carpaccio with black truffles for a starter. Next enjoy one pasta or a sampling of a select 4 on one plate. Save room for a  whole branzino or grilled steak.
I'm  a dessert lover so no meal is complete without a sampling of gelato and a shot of espresso.
The menu varies seasonally and there are also many options for vegetarians.< /Text>

Very average food and mediocre service. We were a party of four. Three of the entrees were served 10 minutes prior to the fourth. No apologies whatsoever from our waiter. We decided to call it a night and go get a gelato on Ocean Ave instead. It took our dear waiter another 15 minutes to process the bill (total amount equally split between two credit cards so nothing too crazy). I will not be back and I would not recommend.< /Review>

Parking:  Difficult street, paid lots (medium difficulty)

Came here on a Thursday night and at 5PM, the only opening was at 7PM.

I ordered the

-Truffle mushrooms (THIS IS WHAT I WOULD RETURN FOR.. THIS WAS DELICIOUS).  They tasted like dry portobellos, lightly grilled or spritzed with truffle oil.  SO GOOD. Definitely recommend this overpriced dish.
I would order these mushrooms again 100%.

-Meatballs were really tender.  Soft and the sauce was not overpowering at all.  However, nothing special.

-Ordered the lobster ravioli.  Really good but wouldn't order it again.  The sauce was tasty and lightly salted.  The ravioli skin was really delicate and had the perfect amount of chew.

-Langostines. They were good and I think VERY LIGHTLY SEASONED.  To me, this should be more of an appetizer since all the other dishes overpowered this one.  However, the meat was tender and great to try..  Try once but that's all I would recommend.

Final verdict:  I would return ONLY for the truffle mushrooms... MMMMM</review>

F-ing food is amazing it's actually better than that I just can't find a word to fit.  Waiters ate fantastic and if I'm not mistaken they all speak Italian.  The place is a little small so make a reservation you will not be disappointed. The food is a little more then you might be used to spending but don't let that stop you.  Treat yourself you only live once and if you live in California I promise you will not find a better Italian restaurant then Via Venato.  The next really good Italian restaurant is about 2800 miles east.< /Review>

Pretty disappointed. Service was so slow, we were there for 2.5 hours and took us over 30 mins to get the check, kept having to ask. And then they charged us wrong and had to do it all over again. Food was good however we ordered the “whole fish” for $50 and when it came out it was a tiny piece of dry white fish all on its own. Cannot BELIEVE that it cost $50 it’s absolutely ridiculous.<//Text>

Asparagus ravioli that is to die for! (Words that I thought I would never utter) Boutique authentic restaurant with a very Italian staff who are very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine. The venue is cozy with a romantic vibe. Each table is accented by traditional candlelight. I was blown away by the salads, both the seafood medley and mushroom salads were great from the tasting menu. More importantly, I do not care for salads in general.
If you want the most bang for your buck, stick with the pasta and salads. The meat and seafood courses definitely are on the pricey side.</Text>

I have been meaning to write as I never do but felt compelled. After 15 years as one of many foodies from SF, (owned 3 organic sustainable restaurants), moved to LA a year ago, I can honestly say this is the best Italian restaurant in Santa Monica. The food is prepared to perfection, the Italian staff & its service is exceptional. You feel as if you are in Roma, its a slice of Italy in our back yard. Magnifico!< /text>

I don’t know about others, but I am in love with this place. I’ve eaten here many times in the past 16 years, and I never left having a bad experience. Absolutely delicious gourmet Italian! The ravioli are a killer, bt to be honeat, everyhing I ever ate was top notch - fresh, delicioussss, healing food, and great presentation.
This has been on Main St for many years and is loved by locals, a true local staple.
The people are great also, always friendly and conversational. It is a smaller sized spot, with very romantic atmosphere and perfect for that great date you have your eyes on 👌👀❤️🤙. Yesss, the ladies will LOVE this, if they love Italian food. Low lights, and very classy ✨💯🙏.< /review>

<Review>I don't understand what the fuss is with this place, the food definitely isn't up to snuff.

Also the server wasn't satisfied with his tip and came back to the table to publicly shame us, silly bald Italian guy.

We ordered a four course meal and everything tasted so good, we shared every dish, three hungry men could eat a lot. The service was excellent, and we just walked in, we waited 20 mins for our table, not bad for no reservation. Highly recommended.</review>

Best lobster ravioli ever!!!!!!!!!!!! ugh, I could eat it everyday!!!  Ambiance is very sexy.  Great for date.  Small tables, with water, appetizers, bread, candles, and wine, it becomes irritating.  Anyway tables and horrible valet service still gets a 2 thumbs up from me.< /Review>

Had a reservation last night for my wife's birthday at 8pm. Arrived at 755 and waited 30 minutes without being seated. It wouldn't have been so bad if there were somewhere to sit inside, but their bar has no chairs and can only fit 2 people. We had to wait outside in the 50 degree weather the entire time. At the very least I'd expect to have someone check in with us to provide an update or offer us something to eat/drink, but that didn't happen. Very frustrating experience. Not something I'd expect from such a high end restaurant, especially when they know we're there for a special occasion.<//Text>

This may be my favorite restaurant. We've been 3 times and each time is the best meal I've had. The menu is simple but the food is very impressive. Most recently we had the pumpkin sage ravioli, prime rib beef carpaccio with truffle, turbot and langoustine. I preferred the langoustine over the turbot but both were delicious. Yes it is expensive but it's special and if you appreciate good food then you will know this is worth it.</review>

<review>Best Italian restaurant in Los Angeles. Everything on menu is truly amazing. Food as afford if not better than being in Italy. Staff are amazing. Uní pasta, the best ravioli in USA. Spaghetti pomodoro is better than Italian grandmas. Filet with porchini mushroom sauce is heaven. Branzino cooked In salt is mind blowing. Crab salad is the best ever. Grilled prawns melt in your mouth, spaghetti with bottarga is simple and unbelievable.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>My boyfriend and I asked our waiter for suggestions. He was very knowledgeable about the food (his name was Simone I think) and suggested their portobello mushroom appetizer. It came sliced with melted cheese atop…just amazing! Next we chose the Prime NY Battuta. Simone suggested a perfect red wine pairing. The steak itself was soft enough to slice with a butter knife! My compliments to the chef!< /review>< pics>

<Review>Get the Raviolis!  They are the best part of the menu.  The tables a very close together, so don;t expect any privacy in your conversation.  While you are looking over the menu, keep in mind that they are going to read you a list of specials a mile long and you will most likely want one of them.  i gotta say, i ordered the $24 vegetable risotto and complained very loudly to my dinner companion about the high price, then when i saw the small portion complained even louder, but by the third bite i'd definitely quieted down.  this was the best Italian I've ever had in LA and worth every penny.  i tried my date's dish too and can't decide which was my favorite. It is a pricey place, but I think it is well worth it.</Review><user>106899407588508775056</user>< Rating>

I especially loved the crostini, & portobello risotto with truffles, & the spaghetti with lobster.  We ordered two bottles of brunello di montalcino (#606 + #617) and both were delicious and reasonably priced ($144 + $167).

The restaurant is small so a reservation is recommended.  There’s valet parking in front if you can’t find a metered parking spot.< /review>< Pics>

We had an incredible meal here.

I loved the pumkin sage ravioli, squid ink pasta with baby calamari, the uni pasta was out of this world amazing, lobster ravioli, ricotta ravioli were all amazing! Oh get the cheese plate! it comes with 5 different types of cheese and the honey comes with black truffle. SO delicious!

The wines that Franco suggested were all great. I loved the Prosecco to start and loved the chardonnay from napa.

Via Veneto is gorgeous, dimly lit, romantic with beautiful chandeliers.

Excellent place to come for a special occasion or date night.

The restaurant was lit by candlelight and perfectly romantic!Warm bread with extra-virgin olive oil for dipping was promptly served, accompanied by green and black kalamata olives. I ended up ordering the ravioli combo plate, which came with a trio of lobster, asparagus, and pumpkin ravioli. I must say, there wasn’t one that didn’t melt in my mouth! I will defenetley go back.< /Review>

<review>I was really in the mood for seafood. I started with the calamari salad. I still can’t seem to get my scallops to taste right when I cook at home, but these were awesome. Not to mention, the calamari was not chewy….. It’s just a great combination altogether. For the main course I ordered the spigola. My waiter Carlo was very sweet and convinced me to order dessert (okay, so there was no convincing, but I have to satisfy my sweet tooth). I went with the panna cotta. Honestly, it was so good I wouldn’t mind coming to Via Veneto for this alone. Can’t wait till next time!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

My first time at the beautiful Via a Veneto last night. It was our 29th wedding anniversary and we were celebrating with four nights at Shutters On The Beach and dinners in a variety of different restaurants in Santa Monica. First, we are a well travelled couple. Second, I am Italian and a foodie. Dining at Via Veneto was like being in Italy. Entire staff is Italian... charming, sweet and very warm. Service was impeccable. The food was spectacularly delicious. My husband had the burata, heirloom tomato and prosciutto to start and veal Milanese for his entree. My appetizer was a duo of fresh salmon tartare and fresh ahi tuna tartare. Both tartare were made with olive oil and was very delicious and so fresh. My entree was a porcini veal scalloping. It was mouthwateringly divine. For dessert we split the panna cotta with fresh berries and Nutella. Everything was wonderful. The restaurant itself is beautifully lit be three chandeliers and the room is intimate. One of the nicest things about Via Veneto is that it’s not noisy. One can have a conversation without shouting. We just loved it and will be coming back soon. You must make a reservation. This restaurant is a little gem and is always booked. Be warned however, it is not an inexpensive restaurant but I believe that you get what you pay for and Via Veneto definitely delivers.<//review>

<userid>106330183764507937487<//userid><review>Come here is you like pretentious food somehow manages to be both overly complex and at the same time bland tasting and for good measure expensive - but mostly come here is you want your server to treat you like a peasant from the 1800's - our table received 3 eye-rolls (that we saw) for who knows what reason - maybe because we were 50 years younger then the average patron? It was so blatant as to actually be amusing- wish the food was as fun!

To the owners stop acting like you're a Michelin star restaurant and treat your customers with the respect and courtesy any patron deserves, regardless of perceived wealth, social standing or race.</review><Resp>None<//Resp><Name>Charles McCoy<//Name></record></dataset><record>

I am screaming ROMANCE and elegance from my expereince at Via Veneto!

Try to look for street parking but valet is $7

So to start I have to say i absolutely fell in love with Franchsesco's accent and how attentioned to detail he was. He brought out the best suggestions and the most delicious subsitution for a vegetarian! I bet i could of asked him to just record him speaking the alphabet and he would of done it in a jiffy! Btw- i must of raved about his amazing accent at least 10x that people in our party must of thought i was crazy!

Prosecco - how can you go wrong with Prosecco especially to start the evening!
The group seemed to really enjoyed the
Black Squid Tagliolini with baby Calamari and Bottarga Uni Spaghetti dish and I personally really enjoyed my
Ravioli tasting with the  - spinach, tomato was DEEELICIOUS!  , Ricotta, Di zucca Pumpkin in butter Sage.
My Mushroom Risotto was Ahhhmazing that i had to save it for the following day just so i can savor it a bit longer!

Now my favorite part of the evening : DESSERTS!!
They absolutely did not disappoint, i almost fell off my chair on how delectable every single dessert i tried this faithful evening!

profiteroles- ahhhhh melt away ...just melting
panacotta - I could of had at least 10 of these!!
tiramisu - THE perfect tiramisu !
sbrisolona - nutella short bread cake- How can you go wrong with Nutella!??! TELL ME HOW!?

eccoci qua (echo chi qua) means "here you go"...BOOm Thank me later after you give this place a shot!< /review>

(Translated by Google) A very chic and romantic restaurant. Italy in all its splendor. The kitchen is precise, with great taste. The service is at the top. Attention must be reserved to be sure to have room. 200 usd on average to two.

This was my second time going to this particular nail salon. They quickly got me in for an appointment, even tho they were packed full when I walked in. I got a manicure done, a full set of gel acrylic. Nail technicians were friendly and accommodating to my needs. (I recently injured my wrist so doing normal things, such as simple movements, weren't as easy as usual. She was very sensitive and paid close attention to better assist me.) I described what I wanted and I got exactly that. Good experience. Thanks!<//review>

<review>1. I had to choose my own nail polish which I did not like.
2.they book people when obviously they’re full.
3. Nail tips are cheapy and they looked crooked when they put it on my nails.
4. She has a attitude.
5. She told me to go dry my nails without instructions under this thing that wasn’t even on and I didn’t know.
6. She didn’t tell me when or if I could leave the nail dryer so I sat there for a half hour more than I needed too.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Always clean. I have been coming here for the last 5 years or so. I can only speak to the pedicures. I enjoy the massage and scrub. The hot towels are nice too. They are always polite. Polish is alwsys nice and neat. I am always very relaxed when they work on my toes.<//Review><user_name>Brownshuga Mo Smith<//user_name><GmapID>0x54d4000810cde343:0x144f867433fa0966</GmapID>< date>

Made a pedicure reservation for four and it was not honored. The ladies in the salon literally let 2 walk-ins be served while we were announcing ourselves while standing in the lobby. There was no apology or attempt to make things right. One of the nail techs even rolled her eyes at us while we were trying to figure out what was going on. People in our party had traveled from Fortuna and McKinleyville to be seen at our appointment time, but the employees clearly did not care. This was my first visit to the salon and I will not be returning. Very poor customer service.<//Text>

<Text>I just walked in, left from another salon. There are three employees and Within 10 minutes they began my pedicure and was able to get me in for a full set of acrylics and matching toes and are charging me less for all of it! Where U.S. Nails Only had one employee working and wanted $80 for long acrylics with gems and more to add toes!! Not only that but the customers in here are friendly and the staff is extremely polite and they have massage chairs for the pedicures. It’s nicely decorated inside they have lots of colors and it’s a relaxing experience! Im very particular and I’m not gonna go anywhere else for my nails in Humboldt County!!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>I went to this place yesterday for a pedicure around 2 PM. I was very happy with my experience here. The people here are so welcoming! ! I didn't feel rushed and they did an awesome job. I think the prices are very good for the area as well. Clearly I really like it here. So I would highly recommend this spot for all!<//Review><user_name>Margaret L.

< review>
A bit pricey for gel nail polish. Pedicure was 25, but I got gels & it was 45, plus tip is a 50 pedicure. The lady had my water so hot I couldn't put my feet in, then she drained some & started putting ice cold water in, so I got a cold foot soak. ☹ I told her several times she could stop the cold water but she didn't understand English. Other than that they were nice, the place was clean, & they had a great color selection.</review>

I did Shellac and they got it on my skin around the edges on both hands and feet. Terrible service, terrible paint job- I could have done better myself!! And VERY overpriced for Shellac. I will never come in here again. Go elsewhere!!<//text></record></dataset><record>
< Text>
Absolutely horrific service. No one ever spoke to me until I paid prior to paint application and I was POINT BLANK ASKED “ARE YOU GOING TO TIP ME?!” I was going to but 1. This is OPTIONAL 2. The service wasn’t completed!  I was shocked! Also the massage lasted 10 seconds and the paint application was done very poorly. I will not be going back.< /Text>

They did the shellac for my nails and it was perfect! My technician was very talented and she fixed everything exactly to my liking. 2 weeks later and my pedicure is still good as new! The place is clean and relatively quiet. I'll continue to be their customer.</review>

Just what I needed. The massage chair was perfect and the man who did my pedicure did an amazing job. The hot stone leg massage was my favorite.< /text>

< Review>
Went to this shop because don't know the area and needed a fill & pedi. I will not be returning. I was over charged a lot for the quality of service I received. So going to chalk it and remember to NEVER visit this nail shop again nor recommend it to anyone. Your better off nail less then sporting a sh** nail job form this place.< /Review>

The last review was right. The service is horrible. The only people that do a decent job is the men who work there. That lady with the fake hair is very rude as mentioned. She actually cut my finger because she was filing so fast & not paying attention. She acted like she didn't even notice the blood gushing from my finger, as she kept moving along until I looked at her crazy & asked for something to stop the bleeding. I was livid!! This same lady waxed my eyebrows & acted like she didn't need to wax the top when that was the bushiest part. She was just trying to do as little work as possible for as much $ as she could get. This is always a last resort place when the other salons in town are way too busy. Other than that, don't waste your time or $$ on this place.</Review>

Very friendly atmosphere. There was a sort of limited selection of fresh fruits and vegetables when I went, and one fresh flower stand. The majority of the market is comprised of a variety of prepared foods and drinks (ex: Korean BBQ, artisan grilled cheese, Poke, Indian, Mediterranean...stuff like that). There was also two places to get fresh eggs and one of those places also sold fresh meat. In addition to that there were a few booths with non-food items like candles​, lotion, jewelry, clothing. Plus, there were two places with live music. It's not nearly as big as the Little Italy Farmer's Market, but it is nice.<//text>

I love this farmers market! A few blocks of a street in North Park are closed off for it, so just look for street parking in the neighborhoods (if you end up parking far, there are so many electric scooters that you can use to speed up your trek to the market. Lots of fresh produce, and fun food options. I tried the Lebanese street food stand and got a half Zaatar and half Akkawi wrap (definitely add the veggies for a $1). It was so delicious and I definitely want to try everything else on the menu.

There are a variety of food and drink options and it is also right by a lot of North Park's main businesses if you wanted to hang out there before or after your farmers market trip!<//review>

I love this market and shop there almost every week. While I'm sure each and every vendor there is great, I mostly frequent the produce stands. I love being able to buy fresh, in-season produce at affordable prices directly from the farmers who grow it. The market has really expanded a lot in the last year and even has live music on most nights. Check it out!</Text>

Great little farmers market! Great people. Dog friendly! Took the puppy who is still learning about walking around in crowds and people were very understanding of his puppiness.... He lived all the attention he was getting and calmed down after we were there for a bit.</text>

Lovely little farmers market and craft thing. Always something fun to browse. The guy selling honey sticks was super fun to chat with. If you are there and see his booth, get a Pins Colada and a Chocolate stick, together they taste like chocolate macaroons... My favorite! And my fave used to be root beer.</Text>

Every Thursday of the year (except Thanksgiving Day) this is the place to be for local food and music. The vibe here is very friendly and community oriented. Organic groceries, prepared foods, arts by local artists, and everything from soup to nuts is available here. Get yourself and your friends to the market!<//Text>

This is one of the smaller Farmer's Markets in the area, but it still has a good selection of produce, cooked foods, desserts, etc.  Parking around here can be a little tricky, so be patient and be willing to walk several blocks to and from the market.< /review>

This is my regular FM in San Diego, great produce vendors especially as well as excellent meat from DaLe Ranch. Not nearly as crowded or hard to find a place to park as compared to the over-hyped Little Italy and Hillcrest FMs.</text>

< Review>
Today I was in the Subway on Henderson and I was blown away!  I was there during their lunch rush and they were busy.  The owners of that Subway should be very proud of the crew that was working that shift.  With the speed that the crew had would put any fast food restaurant to shame!  Food was awesome, crew was fast and friendly plus the store was nice and clean.  Keep up the awesome job young men and women.< /Review>

< Review>
No Only do they Make DELICIOUS Sandwiches, are ALWAYS Smiling, Kind & Courteous..they are HONEST..!
After purchasing a Yummy Foot-Long Steak & Cheese.. I must have Dropped my Wallet somewhere in or around the Store..!!
As most wallets do.. I had EVERYTHING in there..Including  $280..!!  I came back the following morning and before I could ask..the Gentleman behind the counter asked me if I had Lost my Wallet..!!
He Apologized for going through it but it was only to try and contact me..!
Everything was in it..even the $280..!!  Thank you Subway for Hiring an AWESOME Crew..!!< /Review>

My husband was near to this restaurant and got me and my son this pizza for dinner. Its the worst pizza we have ever had. We bought mushroom and olive and cheese topping pizza. Pizza crust was too much thick and burnt at the bottom. Obviously to cook that big crust, they might need to cook so much time and burn the bottom.  Also the cheese layer on the top is so little and mushroom is chopped into too tiny pieces and pizza was looking odious too. Priced little high... But still I don't complain much on price.  this is the first time we got and we are not getting it again....< /text>

Wow, one of the best pizza I ever had was at this place .....I am a vegetarian I ordered a no meat pizza and my friend ordered some chicken wings she loved the wings ....in short it was a win-win for both ....nice place to hangout, also ..as it’s Covid-19....we need to maintain social distancing but there is a really good seating out side ......</Review>

It was a nice outdoor dining experience. Same great pizza. Clean tables to eat at, spaced far enough apart to see other people and not feel too close. I can't wait for the next pizza night.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I got the Hawaiian BBQ Pork and it was so good, I almost stopped my mom when I saw her grab another slice! The only problem was that I got the thin crust and it was a burnt on the edge, but it's probably because there's really no way to avoid it (it's either get it a little burnt, or get it undercooked).<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>WOW. Pizza was super thick and I was worried about it being too bready but it was all crispy- the bottom of the pizza and the crust. I don’t think I’ve had a pizza like that before. My only issue was that the toppings were a little cold. We loved our pizza though and we will be back if ever in the area.<//Text><rate>4< /rate></record>

<Text>My coworkers and I recommend Legends pizza for your office catering/outings! ♥️♥️♥️

The highlight is that the pizzas don’t feel heavy in your belly, the dough is magical. All ladies in the office went for at least 6-8 slices. 👍🏼🍕♥️

We tried all the types of crusts, we loved them all, specially the gluten free!

Meat lovers were in love with the teriyaki chicken over a normal crust.

Veggies in the office were amazed by the freshness of the onions, 🍅, 🥦.

The Mediterraneans couldn’t have been happier with their pizza with tons of jalapeño.

Our office manager liked it so much that we’re having them again next week 👌🏼< /Text><user>116193825748257647725</user>< Rating>

Good pizza and beer and casual atmosphere with friendly staff.  Prices and decor could be better, so leaving one star off so they have something to aspire to.< /review>

<Text>Best pizza you'll probably ever find. 100% worth checking out. Extremely fast too. Staff is very friendly and will take care of you're pizza, salad and wing needs. Seriously do yourself a favor and try some, even if you arent feeling pizza. It's one of those places you just dont skip over.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< date>

I like their lunch deal. The staff are nice. Sometimes they don't have pizzas for lunch because they are making and baking a huge corporate order or party, but they offer a salad bar deal if u ask. Which I don't mind at all.</text>

<Review>Pizza is like Mcharts but better.  The crust is lighter.  Very healthy tasting which I like.  Most pizzas taste like there is something artificial in them and Legends does not have that.  .  Best eaten very fresh as the toppings are very generous and can make the crust a little soggy if not eaten within 15 minutes.  When we have take out pizza my wife and I reheat slices in a frying pan to make them crisp again and then the pizza is good.<//Review>< Time>

I keep looking for a favorite pizza place in this area and I was hoping this might be it. Unfortunately it just wasn't very good at all. The crust was tasteless. The toppings and sauce we're kinda run off the mill. I gave 2 stars because it was just barely ok and customer service was nothing special. I won't be back.< /text>

This place that took over the location had a high bar to meet. And truth be told, I really enjoyed it. My son, the pizza critic, also enjoyed it. McHart's will also be a special place to me...but I'm glad that there's still good pizza to be had in that location.< /review>< Pictures>

Best pizza in Cupertino hands down. Try the chicken bruschetta you won't be disappointed. They have 5 tvs and all the big games playing. Great happy hour beer on beer and wine as well. Check this place out.< /Text>

I'm not an expert like the others but I'd say their pizza is really good and the staff and owners are outstanding.< /Review>

Very friendly people, great gluten free crust, I’ve had reactions at other pizza places from cross contamination, but never at Legends.< /Review>

This location is far and above the rest. The facility is beautiful, with  an open floor plan, and very clean. The holds and setting are top notch. They have a lovely training facility as well as a moon board and hydraulic tension board for the average climber such as myself. And as a bonus, the pricing is quite reasonable.

I have no doubts that this gym will be successful and hope that they may consider expanding to more locations in the future.</text>< Resp>

It has a beautiful interior design that is set up to accommodate the best equipment and present a spectacular atmosphere for the fitness guru.
I cant wait for this gym to finally take off. The rock climbing arena looks absolutely stunning!!!

I have been going here for about 7 months and LOVE it.  The gym is huge with a fantastic top rope area as well as shouldering area.  The staff is wonderful and super helpful.  Go, take a class and see what it is all about.  You will be hooked too. Especially great for a work out that doesn't seem like work.</review>

<text>We met Grayston when we walked in to check out the gym and his enthusiasm was delightful. It's a spectacular space with a welcoming feel in the common hallway and the cleanest and most spacious bathrooms, worthy of a fancy restaurant. All I do is boulder so it was really fun to try the gym out - I loved it. The pads are great, really comfy to land on. Some of the walls are pretty high so it's good to get your footing. The setting is solid, really great problems with lots of core, maneuvering, technicality, and power. My partner tried some great beginner grades and she found the V0-V2 to be pretty good. I loved the V5-7s and loved the slab wall and the overhangs. The weight room upstairs has an indoor and outdoor portion and you have the moonboard and the hangboards. The staff is great and everyone seems to be on their game when it comes to making sure to keep things clean, distanced, and masked. Parking wasn't bad for us, usually 2 hour spots available. And I think LBR has agreements with a few businesses near them to use their lots at certain hours - it's worth asking them about it. They sell chalk and chalk bags and a few other items. Can't wait for my next session.<//text>< pics>

LBR is taking all the best of older gyms and making it better-- Better locker rooms, better saunas, prettier yoga rooms, and more aesthetic climbing walls at all the best angles. The space isn't 100% complete-- like the cafe and gear shop are future cool features, but the climbing walls, weight room, and training walls are all SO nice. Can't wait to train there as much as possible!!!</review>

I have been to a LOT of gyms and, despite the limited real estate space, this gym knows how to provide an enjoyable experience.

They have everything you need to train to crush that outdoor problem.

The setting here is diverse and very fun.
One of the finest aspects of Long Beach!!!<//Text>

Was in town from Minnesota and stopped by to check out Long Beach Rising. The facilities are top notch and super clean. They have fully equipped locker rooms with showers, sauna, and so forth. I climb around a V4 level and found the gym to cater very well to all levels, with easily identifiable and consistent routes. 15$ for first time visitors it was well well worth it!<//Review>

Awesome climbing gym. The staff are amazingly friendly and easy-going. So are the members and visitors! I'm completely new to bouldering and I still felt super welcome, like I belonged here. The facility is huge and beautiful as well. There's a small weight room and two roomy yoga rooms if you want to do some post-climb stretching. So happy to have this community resource in the neighborhood and on top of it, a brewery next door for post-climbing pints! $15 for your first day pass — just do it.<//review>

This gym is wonderful - clean and modern, solid route setting, latest amenities, chill staff. The interior is unlike any space for gyms and creates an awesome vibe around training, particularly the Moonboard. The setting and angles ares awesome. Problems that make you think and work you.

While it is early days right now, can't wait for the new features coming to this gym.</Review>

I was visiting family in Orange county from New England and had heard of this gym from being a big fan of the bachelor (lol). We always hit a few climbing gyms when we visit but this was by far our favorite. Beautiful facilities and great routes. The movement was very fun and there were a good variety of climbs and holds. Everything flowed really well and we liked the mats. Also awesome to have both a moonboard and tension board! We will definitely return someday!</Text>

Jan. 12, 2019 - Nice new climbing gym. Fresh routes to try with some unique holds. The walls are like sandpaper for more friction, but easy to scrape skin as well. Friendly staff.  Open house mid January but formally opens Feb 2019. Monthly membership fee in the $80s.< /Review>

The setting is really good and has a nice mix of technical and pumpy, fair ratings. Really great amenities and a very unique building, the amount of climbable wall space is great. They reset once a week to keep things fresh and do not clutter the walls. The best aspect about this gym are the holds, they are the newer holds the market has, some stuff you would see on the IFSC and the friction is awesome, even their walls have grit and you can smear really well. My shoes might degrade faster though. Tall walls, so throwing to a upper hold when you feel not secure in your position feels slightly panicky, but it makes you commit to the move. Glad  they just opened, Hangar 18 has the oldest holds I've ever seen, like holding onto glass they are so polished down and greased up. Long Beach Rising is expensive, but they appear to have put a lot of money into the gym and it shows.< /review>

The best experience I’ve had with any eye doctor. Super friendly, easy going, helpful and professional. Answered all my questions and provided superb advice when I brought up my issue with dry eyes. Would recommend to anyone looking for an eye exam.</Text>

<Text>Dr Pang was very knowledgeable and passionate about her work. She explained so many things no other Optometrist had ever mentioned before went into detail and made sure we understood. She had a great attitude and my family and I are very pleased and look forward to continue going to her for all of our vision needs. So happy and very satisfied with our visit.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Dr Pang is the best. I came to her when I needed my first pair of prescriptions and she    perfect in my prescription. Also guiding me in how to wear eye glasses. Today, I decided to add contacts for my everyday lifestyle and she was so patiently  in making sure I left with the right prescription by testing me twice and changing the right prescription when I left her office. I don’t trust any other doctor when in comes to my eyes. I have recommended  family members and friends to come and see her and everyone loves her.

Thank you Dr. Pang for your kindness, your patience and the wonderful service you give us in making us feel comfortable with our new eye vision!</Review>< Pictures>

Excellent experience!!! So glad I went here! Dr. Pang was so sweet and knowledgeable and I felt so comfortable during the whole experience. I've been to many eye doctors in my 27 years of needing glasses/ contacts but by far my best experience yet.<//review>

Diane Tran is the best eye optometrist I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Her professionalism, charisma, and knowledge are superior. She makes sure you are comfortable throughout the eye exam and constantly checks on your comfort level. She makes you feel relaxed and guides you through all eye exams. She explained my prescription with thoroughness . I can tell she loves her profession. I felt uplifted by her positive energy. Thank you Diane Tran. I am so thrilled Diane Tran is my optometrist.</review>

<text>This was my first appointment with Dr. Pang and I found the whole experience very positive. The appointment was easy to book online and the location was convenient with good parking and easy access inside Target. Dr. Pang is very friendly and made me feel very comfortable with all the Covid safety measures. The eye exam was extremely thorough and Dr. Pang explained the purpose behind each test procedure and the results. She addressed all my concerns, answered my questions, and gave me a good sense of what to expect as my eyes age. I left feeling that I had just met a caring, highly skilled optometrist and a wonderful person!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>Dr. Alice Pang took her time with me during my eye exam. She noticed something in my eye when we were reviewing the pictures, so she had me take a few more pictures to make sure it wasn't anything concerning. She answered all of my questions, which is the main reason why I continue going to her.
When she called me in, she checked my temperature and had me wash my hands. Everything was sanitized multiple times! After my exam, I went to the front to choose out my glasses. The woman who helped me (I don't remember her name) had chosen a few for me. She had great taste because I went with one of the ones she chose! Thank you Target Optical! I will be back next year!<//Text>< Time>

<review>This was my first time seeing Dr. Tran.  She explained each test and the reason for it.  She also answered all my questions and took time when fitting my contacts.  I haven't had this kind of service in years.   I know she has become my lifetime eye doctor.   In fact, I even purchased contacts and glasses - something I never do.  I usually leave with prescription and order them online.   Thank you Dr. Tran.   I will see you next year!  And I will be telling all my friends/family about you.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The ladies in the front were helpful in letting me know what my insurance covered and what procedures would be an extra cost during my eye exam. Dr. Pang explained my retinal scans well and answered my questions about Lasik in a very understandable way. They are efficient and informative, with a comfortable atmosphere in the clinic. It's also a bonus that they're inside Target so I can continue my errands all in one place!</review>

Doctor was professional and helpful .. employees are very rude and non-attentive to client perception. Very short and constantly talking to each other as customer waits in front of them. Went to another place to buy glasses because of poor service.<//text>

Dr. Pang was quite thorough and didn't seem rushed.  For an eye exam that included retina photos took about 1/2 hour.

Her and her staff were quite pleasant and took their time to satisfactorily answer my many questions.

I've been looking for a new optometrist and will be a continuing patient of Dr. Pang in the future.< /Text>

Dr. Pang's conversation with me as her client was engaging and informative; she explained the purpose behind the tests she conducted, and kept me feeling calm and at ease....a true professional:)< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

The doctor is very efficient and comprehensive. I feel like I had everything taken care of. I came in three years ago for my last eye exam, and I will continue to see Dr. Pang in the future. She is the only eye doctor I need, and I can get the exam done during my lunch break.</Review>

< Review>
I have been a patient of Dr. Pang for about three years now. Every visit has been a positive experience. I keep returning to her because she appears to genuinely care about her patients and is always very professional. She asks a lot of questions to fully understand your concerns and she takes the time to explain everything. I have recommended her to family and friends and they have had the same experience. Thanks Dr. Pang.</Review>

She’s the only dr. I’ve ever had, that cared to take the extra time to notice details that might be life altering. Nobody ever cared to tell me if I had signs of something that could be serious.... and I get routine yearly exams ever since 2000.<//Review>

The only place to get a good "touch wash" in town.  The offer of a clean inside your car is cheap though.  The guy who does it is never available ( even when you make an appointment ) we drove here twice for it and sat around for nothing.  The cheaper price tag for the internal clean was worth nothing as it wasted my time and time is money, on top of that, when I complained about this issue the manager only offered the clean to be "more thorough"  it should be as thorough as possible in the first place dude.< /Text>

Came here looking for an interior and exterior detailing, came out losing value on my car. What a joke. I wouldn't even go here for their most basic wash. I, like the idiot I am, decided to take my car here in a whim. The guy apparently running the shop did a full walk around of the car, going through the trunk, the gas cap, saying how they'll take care of it all. After paying a rather premium fee of $265, and waiting six hours for their interior and exterior detailing. My car came out with more scratches than I came in with, and there weren't that many to begin with. I had to argue over a poor DETAILING job for fifteen minutes straight, pointing out the obvious places they missed, thankfully I at least got a half refund.  The kid running around with a rag mouthed off that it was "just a pine needle" when clumps plant matter were everywhere.  Dirt could be wiped off with your finger in many places.  The mats were sitting beside the car still dirty when I showed up. The photos show for themselves - don't risk your car or money, I did it for you.< /text>

I drove 20 minutes to get my car washed and vacuumed. I arrived 15 minutes before closing, at 4:45 pm. The employee said I too late to get my car washed and vacuumed. I don’t think I was the first to be turned away. There was another car backing out when I pulled in and I wouldn’t be surprised if the car after me was turned away as well. Expensive too, $22 for the middle range wash and vacuum.</review>

Behind a lube place.  Can be busy during the later morning and into afternoon.  You stay in your car or sit and wait under the porch.  Staff changes a lot.  Hot and hard job.  You may be better off doing your own windows.  Last time there I paid them to vacuum and clean the interior and they skipped half of it.  Varied prices.< /Text>

They broke his drivers side door handle and refused to admit that it happened even though they left the door open for him to get in the car so he wouldn't know before he left. They did not return his floor mats. The owner refused to come to the shop or see him at all. When he went back for the floor mats they gave him two instead of all four.

Very disappointed.   Didn't soap or brush my car before entering the wash.  Didn't dry my windows after going through wash.  Had to go to the office to the owner to get my windows dried.  People at the start of wash acted like I was bothering them.  Poor customer service.  I would rather go to self wash than be treated and served like I was this time.</Review>

<review>I had already been there almost an hour. There were only two cars in front of me. By the time they finished I had only 15 min to get my son from school so I didn't really look at things(except thru all the streaks on the front windshield) until I got home. I COULD NOT BELIEVE I PAID $27.00 for this! I've lived here 35 years that was my first time in there. I WILL NEVER GO BACK! And I will be sharing and sharing my pictures and my experience I had here with everyone.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgLZW3x7b62wYaRH7z-RhNZNYDneFHty8_5iMw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGVv_ApJxq3tfFLQFeaEw2TMt_iGbt5gs2p5jL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAz-DrdPw1XbGLxgUM5pELMbjUL9M9-3klQyvT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfIKSWZos3eF_hdLF8XxSnuj_2m8fYDQU68_QB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaF2L4ui4K_dMWQ6HwsW_j0xJhMksonZZZJRhC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x8090cf7c69e41889:0x5939e4c5600190d3<//gmap_id></record>

I went a couple of weeks ago and they did a fine job. They were busy and the guys were working their tails off!  I did just discover while removing my rain mats that the passenger side regular carpet is missing. I tried calling and could not get through. Hopefully I'll be able to get in touch soon, before the mat is gone. Hope I am not already too late.  We are out of town  so cannot stop by. Hope they read their reviews!!??< /review>

AVOID AT ALL COST!!! Absolutely worst car wash I have ever been to. You might as well hose the car off your self. There were some polite staff members but the owner was terrible. I started out polite and courteous pointing out scratches they put on the car and spots they did not clean, and he said "It isn't our job to scrub the car." He then proceeded to tell me all the times people have tried to take advantage of him. Terrible experience</text>

This was the worst customer service I have ever had in my entier life. They were so rude to me, they did not clean the inside at all, left my mats out of my car left the doors open walked up to me and told me he cant do any more work on my car and left,  He had to go to lunch. I paid for thier best wash because my little car needed it and they did nothing to it and treated me like i was trash. That kid has the worst attidued i have ever come across he needs to be fired i would not allow him to work for me that whole place needs to be worked over and taught a lesson on service and keeping loyal customers, i have been there before awhile ago what the hell happened.< /text>

I was very disappointed from top to bottom I had to ask for a rag to do it myself after paying to have done. They used the wrong cleaning product on the inside probably tire cleaner cause it was so greasy I had to go home and clean it again. I asked for the owner to come out and look at the massive smears on my windows, did not look vacuumed and it wasn't even that bad to start with I do not recommend anyone wasting there money there.<//text>

The day we went there was not enough workers and it took about an hour and a half to complete the service and they did not clean the inside wind shield. Very understaffed.< /review>

< Review>
Slow, untrained, drug addicts, that are lying, thieving cheats. Management is very unprofessional; dirty, lazy, disrespectful, waste of space. When will they shut Floyd down with all the OSHA and labor law violations? P.S. The Manager is likely to not understand even the most basic of questions and is extremely short tempered.<//Review>

I am a patient at the Ryan Ranch office. The staff is courteous and professional, starting the moment you walk in the office. Every appointment I've had begins as scheduled. No waiting. The Physical Therapist is well-educated, knowledgeable and listens to all my feedback. Highly recommended as a place to receive your physical therapist needs.</review>

I recently was released from having therapy here after months of appointments and I couldn't be happier with the outcome of it all. Every appointment started and ended with positivity. It didn't matter if I came in depressed, happy, crying or in pain. I always left feeling better, physically and emotionally. The friendliness and professionalism you experience here will make you feel comfortable and confident in yourself. The staff here, every single person, are there for you. They call you by name, always taking the time to address your needs. I want to say that I will miss the staff, they are really fantastic people. Thank you so much for being a part of my recovery, I will miss seeing you and can't tell you enough how much I appreciate you all. Joseph, Janice, Heidi and Michael - you all played different parts in my recovery, Thank You so much.< /Review>

<text>I had a hip replacement and other long term issues that weren’t improving so I went to Terrapin Physical Therapy. I worked with Tri Nguyen for several weeks and I was very pleased with his knowledge and skills. I felt he truly listened to me and patiently worked with every complaint, encouraging me along the way. I will gladly work with Tri again in the future. Plus, I felt very comfortable in the facility. During this period with the virus they are very conscientious about wearing masks, taking temperatures, washing hands and cleaning equipment between clients. I recommend them highly.< /text>< Response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Did a few sessions here for a foot injury at the very end of 2020, at the height of the holiday pandemic surge. Couldn't have been more pleased with the staff, the numerous hygiene protocols in place, or the facility. Excellent hydrotherapy pool. Terrific exercise machines and equipment. The space feels like home -- very comfortable -- which I did not know was possible at a PT place (I'm an athlete so have been to lots). I loved that aspect. My therapist, Michael, was attentive, a good listener, and creative, and the exercises he gave me helped me a lot. Heidi and Janis (sp?) at the front desk were exceptionally helpful and good humored. And, from the hand washing station at the entrance to the swift wipe downs of equipment, the fresh clean towels and bathmats in the pool area, and lack of other folks using the gym area or pool area while I did, I felt extremely COVID-safe. If I could give these folks an extra star, I would. I highly recommend this place.</Review>< pictures>

I have had lower back problems for much of my adult life. In late 2018 I had lower back surgery at Monterey Spine and Joint and was taking a long time to recover. It was suggested that I try aquatic physical therapy, which I did for 18 sessions at Terrapin. The facility is clean. Everyone there, especially Tony, was qualified and comfortable to work with. I improved day by day and now feel that my recovery is almost realized. I continue my physical therapy exercises at home and continue to feel better. I give Terrapin Physical Therapy credit for helping me recover.<//review>

<Review>My experience at Terrapin Physical Therapy (post op knee replacement surgery) has been extraordinary!  I have been especially impressed by the care and expertise of my therapist Tri Nguyen.  He did a very thorough evaluation, helped me set goals that I am thrilled to say I have reached, and went "above and beyond" to help me progress to where I am today.  He obviously loves his work and successfully strives to make a positive impact on his patients' lives.  The facility has strict COVID protocol in place which they follow closely.  A shout-out also to the other staff at Terrapin!  Janice and Juliana at the front desk are friendly, efficient and very welcoming.  Joseph has also been very helpful.  The aquatic therapy has been wonderful and the treadmill in the water certainly added to my success.  I highly recommend that you visit Terrapin when you have physical therapy needs!</Review>< rating>

I wanted to do pool therapy after my hip replacement so my orthopedic surgeon send me to Terrapin and I'm very glad that he did. I really enjoyed my time there and thought that they did a great job.

One of the things that I really liked was that I always worked with the same therapist, Tri. Tri was great and asked me lots of questions about what my desires were for post-operative life, and came up with a treatment plan designed specifically for me. He always listened to what I had to say and then would modify a day's treatment to address any problems I may have had since my last visit. The treatments never felt rushed and I really felt I got the most out of the regime.

They also seemed to have a strict COVID protocol which they followed closely, so I was never concerned with catching the virus during a visit.

I would highly recommend Terrapin to anyone who needs PT on the Monterey Peninsula.<//Text>

The Terrapin Physical Therapy group is truly an exceptional group of talented healers and fantastic people who are sincerely focused on each client’s experience.

The clinic has exceptional energy and provides a safe environment to focus on your healthcare, therapy and physical fitness goals.

Each and every team member made it a point to introduce themselves and ensure I was as comfortable as possible and were highly professional and friendly.

Personally, I would recommend this group to anyone and everyone. Try them. You will be very pleased.

<Review>I went in to see Tony for lower back pain that was preventing me from doing my normal routine.  He was so professional, and is highly educated as he has a Phd in Physical Therapy.  Tony laid out a plan, and explained how the process works.  I followed his directions, and with his expertise, I was amazed at how quickly my back healed.  He helped me recover, and I am now able to do my normal activities.  He also has a very professional staff.  Juliana is very patient, and assisted me with my complicated schedule.  They also have implemented strict COVID safety protocols to ensure you are safe while at the clinic.  I highly recommend Terrapin PT if you want results!<//Review>< pics>

After an extremely intense and long bout with sciatica (in bed for 2 months), I was too weak to have a scheduled full knee surgery. Michael and Tony at Terrapin helped me regain my strength with pool therapy. I worked with Michael for 4 1/2 months and was able to continue with the surgery. Returned for more pool therapy after surgery also. This was a lifesaver for me. Far more effective and less painful on joints than traditional “land” exercises. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. Many thanks!< /Text>

< Review>
Absolutely the best physical therapy team!! I went to see Tony in 6/2018 following my left shoulder surgery.  His knowledge and expertise is the reason I am able to live a normal life.  Shoulder recovery is very difficult physically and emotionally.  I recently had a rotator cuff repair on the other shoulder.  Again, he is my go to for therapy.  Keep in mind I live in Las Vegas and he is located in Monterey, CA.  He is extremely effective in person and virtual.  If I have any in-person rehab needs, I am happy to go to Monterey to see him.  He is awesome!!</Review>

I have been working with Tony post surgery on my big toe joint to address stiffness.  My surgeon wasn't happy with my wimpy version of self-help and said I'd better start seeing a physical therapist or I might not have enough flexibility to ever wear many of my shoes again.  That got my attention and I knew just who to see.  Tony had helped me with shoulder pain years ago so he was the guy I'd be relying on to make sure I can wear pretty shoes again.  It has been about two months now and I'm thrilled with the progress.  Between the work Tony does on my foot, Terrapin's wonderful pool and work-outs, plus the exercises he has me doing at home, I am back to doing everything pre-surgery and am pain-free.  My surgeon said I'm very close to getting a high heel clearance!!
Also....I was seeing Tony during the COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place.  Their office has taken every possible precaution, and I never once felt at risk.</text>

Over the years I have been to several PT practices.  Results were disappointing, as they treated me like a frail old lady. I am an old beat up jock and don't accomplish much with a 5 pound weight.
Michael and the staff and Terrapin challenged me at each visit.  It was so good to know Michael worked with me every time and pushed me  to improve.
I am better off after my sessions at Terrapin.<//Text>

< Review>
To enable an even more efficient and flexible therapy schedule, I received physical therapy sessions at both the Terrapin and Ripple sites.  The consistency and follow-through from site to site and therapist to therapist was excellent and provided an uninterrupted positive continuum of service.  That level of staff communication, in itself, was greatly appreciated.  Clear goals, focused activities toward outcomes, and constant, consistent ongoing education about my personal therapy from the therapists and aides kept my progress at optimum levels.  The hydro-therapy sessions were a powerful asset to my recovery.  The emailed exercise routines for home use were yet another tool to support my success.  Both facilities provided a positive and encouraging environment which supported defraying the 'oft times high stress of real and perceived hurt and pain that the road to recovery can bring about.  Nothing but high kudos and great thanks to the Terrapin and Ripple teams.</Review>

<Date>1546894404118< /Date><Text>Best place I have ever been to for PT--Top of the line facilities--underwater treadmill. I was a college volleyball athlete for 4 years and been to many PT places for various injuries. This last injury I had was the most severe resulting in a kindner procedure foot surgery and a scope done to my foot. Following surgery I developed Complex Regional Pain Syndrome which brought on a number of additional issues. I came to Tony at Terrapin/Ripple unable to stand with crutches  for longer than 5 seconds and 3 months later left running. This was the best PT treatment I have ever had. Tony is very knowledgeable, their underwater treadmill and new equipment was top of the line, and they had weekend hours. I recommend to everyone, and I'm so happy I went to Terrapin and Ripple.

I just can't express enough how extremely happy I am with the treatment I received at Ripple Physical Therapy.  Nathan was my physical therapist and I would recommend him to anyone needing treatment.   He was kind, compassionate and very knowledgeable.  He took the time to teach me proper techniques which will be very helpful for my continued healing.  He seemed to take a sincere interest in helping me overcome my physical limitations.  Which, I feel I have done with Nathan's help.  Even Tony who was not part of my therapy often asked me how things were going and encouraged me to continue on.  And Lexie at the front desk couldn't be more of an asset.  She is professional,  courteous and just down right sweet as honey.  Don't let her go!  Overall I am extremely satisfied and am actually a little sad my time with Ripple is done.  I wish everyone the best.  Thank you Terrapin and Ripple Physical Therapy.  MDGAMOTAN<//text>

I am so glad that I was referred to Terrapin!  I love the environment and the people- always so positive and friendly.  I had nerve and joint issues and I dealt with headaches on a daily basis. Working with Paul and Steve, they were so patient and encouraging in treating my symptoms.  They not only treated the immediate need, but also incorporated strength training and a home program for long-term support.

I love the little nuggets of wisdom they shared to help give me perspective and understanding. They are such experts in their fields and operate with great wisdom and insight.  Bottom line, I received great care, excellent support, and much needed encouragement to work through my challenges.   It was my first experience with physical therapy, and I am so grateful it worked out as it did. I'm ready for the upcoming hula season! Many, many thanks!< /Text>

I was referred to PT for ulnar nerve problems. I came away much better. Tony, my therapist was able to mitigate my symptoms by manipulation and by providing a number of exercises that I can perform at home. My personalized exercise plan is available on line, a great feature. Tony, the other therapists, and the office staff (Heidi) were extremely helpful. If your doctor gives you a choice of physical therapists, I highly recommend Terrapin.<//review>

<Review>I had a sore shoulder from using the kick board wrong in swimming class and Tri helped me.  We started by talking about my injury and Tri asked me what my goals were for recovery.  He kept those goals in mind throughout our sessions, which I appreciated.  Tri follows a very caring process and has a calming presence. Once I finished my 13 sessions, the owners, Tony and Heidi, offered me a gym membership where I went through my sessions and Tri taught me how to use every machine!  Great business, nice, educated and supportive staff!< /Review>< Pics>

Terrapin is the place to go for physical therapy--the facility is clean and modern (my favorite part is the pool), the staff is knowledgeable and attentive, and the treatment is really effective. I originally came to physical therapy at my Mom's request for my lower back pain and saw it as something to dread, but now it's something that I look forward to during the week. I come back not only because it makes my back feel better, but because I have fun. It's an amazing environment.</Text>

Couldn’t be happier! I’m a 48 yr old female who started running at 47. I immediately tore my meniscus, most assuredly to horrible form. Post surgery, saw Tony for PT, then saw him for running guidance a year later. I’m running the fastest, most pain free I ever have and am SOO happy. Best decision I’ve ever made!!!!! ☺️<//review>

<text>Lisa and the rest of the staff at Terrapin were great. I took my therapy seriously and the plan Lisa laid out for me we well thought out. I "graduated" early from therapy due to hard work and being lucky enough to have a great therapist for my wrist issue.<//text>< pictures>

Tri's skill and knowledge taught me so much and helped me successfully work through PT to recover from shoulder and bicep surgery. The entire Terrapin experience including the front office was a 10. We are fortunate to have this quality facility in our community.< /text>

I've been attending Terrapin for approximately 2 months now and it's been an excellent experience. As a military member, my schedule is not fixed; there are seldom unexpected events and situations with Soldiers and their families . The staff at Terrapin always work with me to adjust my appointments. Also, Jennifer is very professional when comes to dealing with me. She answers all my questions and she is always prepared with the specific exercises that I need to recover. I am always please with the service at Terrapin.  Thanks for your service!<//text>

<text>I had surgery to repair a ruptured Achille's tendon nearly 6 months ago. I began PT somewhat against my surgeon's wishes and it the best decision I ever made. I made super quick progress and thanks to the combined efforts of Paul, Katy, and Steve, I am back on the treadmill and expect to be back on the pavement very soon. Not only are they professional and pushed me to a safe limit both on land and in water, the staff at Terrapin are very courteous, friendly, and truly care about your well being. This was my first experience with PT of any sort and I'm glad that I went with Terrapin.</text><user_name>Eric Barajas</user_name>< Date>

<Text>I've had 3 hip surgeries (same hip), two back surgeries and numerous physical therapy sessions, including acupuncture, and nothing has helped as much as the water therapy that I got at Terrapin Physical Therapy and Tony's guidance.  I continue to exercise in the pool using the exercises Tony prescribed.

The entire staff was friendly, knowledgable and very helpful. Local surgeons should experience the water therapy for themselves!<//Text>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I recently suffered an injury that requires physical therapy. I was set up with Terrapin and didn't quite know what to expect. My first appointment was outstanding. I met with Heidi upon arriving and she quickly got me squared away with the paperwork. When I finished, I was quickly seen by my therapist. Tony explained what we would be doing and answered all my questions. He was extremely knowledgeable and built my confidence in the healing process. This injury has come with feeling a little depressed with not being able to live a normal life like before my injury. Tony, my therapist, listened to my concerns and set a plan to help me "get back on my feet."

I mentioned that I would like to come back for a second appointment the following day. They didn't have any times available, so Tony agreed to come in at 7:40am to see me. This was not his usual work time but he went out of his way to accommodate me. I was super impressed with his willingness to help me out. I really want to heal and conveyed this to Tony a few times. I am a motivated customer and he was willing to go overboard to help me achieve my goals.

The pool therapy is unique in California. I understand that there are only 5 locations that have pool based therapy in CA and Terrapin is one of those locations. I enjoyed my pool therapy and responded well to the process.

I am excited about my future sessions with Terrapin and getting back to my normal daily life without this injury!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It really helps that I continue to work between appointments. Terrapin PT has taught me a lot and how to keep it going. They work with you and not force you beyond your ability.

My right hip and back gave me terrible pain.  My therapist, Tri, and Steve provided me with pool therapy, exercises and deep tissue massage that helped put me on the path to recovery in just a few weeks.  I was amazed at the progress I saw in such a short time. I would recommend Terrapin to anyone looking for a dedicated group of health practitioners for physical therapy.</text>

Where to begin?  My husband was involved in a motorcycle accident  due to some idiot running a stop sign, which resulted in a bad wrist break.

After having successful surgery with Dr. James Lin with Monterey Spine & Joint, Dr. Lin referred him to Certified Hand Therapist Lisa Livian with Terrapin Physical Therapy, also at Ryan Ranch.  Lisa had a great relationship with Dr. Lin and could email or call him directly if anything came up, which was great and showed a team approach in my husband's healing.  Lisa would tell him how he was progressing and Dr. Lin would confirm it.

Lisa was so AWESOME and explained every step of therapy and the function of each exercise and would address any questions or concerns my husband had.  She showed me how to massage the scar tissue in my husband's hand between PT sessions and I was grateful for being welcomed into the sessions to be a part of his healing process, versus asked to take a seat in the waiting room.

She and the staff were great, always smiling and warm and tolerant of our sense of humor.

Fast forward 6 months and am grateful to say my husband is healed.  Choosing Dr. Lin and working with Lisa Livian were the BEST decisions we could have made throughout my husband's road to recovery.

Lisa, you were so essential to B's healing and we are thankful beyond words for everything you did for us.  We may have started as patients but left as friends.

They were welcoming, patient, and understanding of the stress that my body was going through as well as understanding the emotional and mental stress related to therapy and my accident.

I love this physical therapy office.  The staff is expert in their treatments and business practices.  I went here to rehab my right hip after replacement surgery.  I responded so much better than I have after other surgery rehabs because I used their pool.  They worked with me to find a safe and quick way to enter the building because my walking is compromised right now.  I finished this therapy about 1 month ago and now I need to exercise my left hip which needs a replacement also but surgery can't be done until July.  With pool therapy I can keep the muscles as strong as possible which will make recovery faster and hopefully keep me out of a nursing home afterwards.  I can wait to get started this time because I know it will make me stronger and reduce the pain I am currently having.< /review>

Terrapin Physical Therapy is an amazing place to be. Not only do they heal your body, but they heal the mind. Heidi, the office manager, does great at her job. She is very friendly and compassionate.Tony, the owner of Terrapin, is an extremely intelligent man. He has nothing but a warm heart.  All of the therapists are skilled, compassionate, honest and empathetic towards patients and staff.

I have worked at Terrapin for about 8 months as an aide. They treat all staff, including myself, like we are a team. I have never had a bad day at Terrapin. Come see what Terrapin has to offer!

While Tony was my main therapist, I also had weekly aqua therapy sessions with Steve, and also benefitted from other sessions with Paul and Jennefer and Katie. I had been suffering from a poor recovery from a total knee replacement, and frankly was despondent about ever recovering fully when I was referred to Terrapin by a physiatrist. I COULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED BETTER PHYSICAL THERAPY, and can hardly express my gratitude to the Terrapin team for the help, and the hope, which they gave me. They are knowledgeable, extremely courteous and respectful, and highly motivated to help people recover!</text>

I have no idea why my staff would tell you we aren't accepting new patients.   Over the 10 years since we began our practice in Monterey, we have always accepted new patients and continue to serve new patients everyday, six days a week.  While we aren't perfect, we work hard to make sure everyone has a 5-star experience with us.  I am looking into this immediately and addressing this issue with my staff.  Again, my apologies and thank you for bringing this issue to my attention.  I wish the very best to you."}< /response>< gmap_id>

Delicious burgers, but slow service...especially when you sit outside. We waited a long time for our drink and fry refills. No fries to enjoy with the yummy burger, and no drinks to wash it down with :(

I suggest the digital table side kiosks include an option for waiter service (especially for outside dining). The only real options on there is buy more food. But we just wanted fries and our lemonades refilled. What’s the point of bottomless if no service?

All that aside, the burgers are still delicious. I loved my tavern burger with fried onions. And hubby inhaled his burning love burger. Mmmm!< /review>

It was good never disappointed with food.  About a 30 min wait for 6 not bad.  Only thing our waitress only came around twice,  other staff helped us.  We had to ask for napkins, sauce, and a fork for the salad ( how do you forget the fork). Overall it was good.<//review>

Ordered online to be picked up. Ordered the black n blue with no pink and no onions plus mustard and an avocobb salad with ranch, and coke. They were on time but forgot the coke. When we got back to our hotel, no fork or dressing for the salad. The burger was rare and full of mushrooms, no mustard. Why bother asking how we want the food cooked if you aren't going to read it? Horrible experience. Shame on you for ruining what should have been a decent meal. God knows I paid enough for it<//review>

<Review>Red Robin's a good place to go the staff is doing their best with the covet stuff and running around.

There's maybe two problems I have which is none of their control at this point of time

1. I try to order online and I can't do that I have to call in.

2. I have a rude customer jumped the line while I was waiting to get help.

The staff is very nice fast friendly service can't go wrong Just don't let any rude customers give you a bad day<//Review>< Pics>

After all, we are colleagues and friends.

As for Red Robin in Roseville, California, I can tell you that a young lady named Kayla has shown me and our GrubHub customers a great deal of respect and kindness and assertiveness in making sure that each order is prepared correctly.

Believe me when I tell you that that is not where the service stops. Kindness and the art of loving and inclusiveness Has No Limitation.

So if you want to enjoy one America’s best burgers prepared in one of America’s best restaurants and served to you by one of the best servers in Roseville, California, go to Red Robin.

Ask for Kayla.

And let her present you with not just the best and most enjoyable night out, But one of the most heartfelt evenings you have ever experienced in your life.

I have to wonder how I could possibly be the kind of person that could know these beautiful human beings and call them friends.

And though I feel unworthy, you should present as if you are. Because You are...

Light and Love to You, dear friends.

Kayla, Sweetie darling, You are the bomb.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Food was awesome. My waiter who took my order and packed it up for me was Amazing! She was so upbeat and naturally casual (genuinely too) and so very nice.  It's really nice to go into a place and the employees are excited & happy to see that you came in to thier place. Nice change! 😁<//Review>

<review>Outstanding food. I usually get the keep it simple buyer just because that’s the kind of guy I am, but I have heard great things about all of their food. I highly recommend the “Mountain High Mud Pie” it is amazingly addicting and is a must eat. They have bottomless drinks and fries. Thank you so much for the amazing food!!</review>< Pictures>

Ordered our food at the table outside the front entrance and was told it would be brought to our car. We waited an hour . I finally went to find the waitress and saw our food sitting on the table inside. The waitress finaly acknowledged me and gave me our food.  Went to the car to eat and everything was cold. This was absolutely unacceptable.  I took the food back and asked for a refund.  This is really sad when restaurants are wanting business to stay open and provide service like this, we will never return to that Red Robin in Roseville again.< /review><date>1609774934087<//date>< response>

Great experience. The amount of customers  were way less than they used to have but that's to be expected  with things opening back up. All of the staff were great. Chris J was our server and he was on top of it. He made sure we had refills on drinks fries and sauces at all times. When we had questions on the menu he was able to help and even helped with options when he was told what we like. He was  making milkshakes for other servers in between  checking on his tables. The food was great. Definitely love coming here and will continue  to go back.< /Review>

<review>An excellent dining experience, largely due to our excellent server. Unfortunately I cannot remember her name, but she had darker hair and bright green eyes, and worked on a Tuesday evening. She was incredibly friendly and checked in with perfect timing to give us drink refills and to see how we were doing. The food of course was wonderful as well. I am a light eater, so normally I do not finish my food, but I did this time, so that goes to show how delicious it was. My partner and I truly enjoyed our time here.< /review>< userid>

We started going here when our kids were small. Now they're all grown up and we still eat here! Mad Love burger is my fav, with a side of honey poppyseed dressing for dipping. My hubby enjoys the Whiskey River Chicken BBQ wrap with a special request for crisply children (instead of the reg chopped/shredded). The service is also usually pretty fast.</Text>

<text>The help was very rude,  VERY.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  They were very disrespectful. I wouldn't recommend this place to veterans,  the over 60 people, red hat women,  or the disabled.  I am disabled.  They don't have management that is ethical to all, let alone  Christian values. Christians don't believe in false witness,  and overbearing attitudes. They need to read Corinthians, love doesn't demand it's own way.  Tomorrow others with love and kindness.<//text><date>1594623622104<//date><Response>None< /Response></record>

<Text>The food was pretty darn good. However, for me personally, cleanliness of a restaurant is very important. If you look closely at this restaurant it's dirty. The women's bathrooms were gross. You can tell that they are not cleaned well. The doors are red and yet around the locks and all the way down it is black. The walls are dirty, the wooden mini blinds are disgusting and it's just overall a very dirty place. Kind of makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-j0QJAHnH6AndGgrawfich6q96XAKlamHBKke=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ5_eTFXuHRok8_vVQYDQ360XKveZQN7I0jyz4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x809b21d688876d09:0xe7b3eaee00aba257< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This was my first time at a Red Robin. Good restaurant, the waitress gave me great suggestions after asking for my taste, bottomless fries and drinks were great. Definitely better than any of the big chains.
Service was very good, the waitress passed by every few minutes to ask if there is anything else she could do for me.</Text></record>

<Review>If you have food allergies this is the place to go for a really good restaurant burger. Their web site has a allergen menu where you check off what you cant eat and they give you options on what's on the menu you can have. Also shows ways you can have menu items by removing what your allergic to. I had the big taco tavern burger on a gluten free bun with no cheese or sliced peppers with a side salad. I usually get the steamed broccoli which is also bottomless. Love coming here, we've always had great service from the wait staff.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Good food and service.  They'll provide you with a tablet listing the nutritional information on everything they offer, if you ask. They'll also put your beverage in a to go cup and top it up at no extra charge.</Text>

What can I say for a place that touts burgers and brews I can give it 5 🌟 for the burgers and leave it at that. Also excellent is the fact that they have a good number of bottomless sides many of which are free with the burgers. The beer selection is very limited and very pedestrian, this place is for young families more than craft beer people.</text>

Good service, good food. Not the best I've ever had but good quality and plentiful. Really enjoyed the Pina colada style (alcohol free) drink. Bottomless fries were a plus.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Catering Review:
I work for Toyota and I ordered the burger bar, salads, cookies, and other sides from Red Robins catering menu for our training event. We had lunch for 75 people 3 days in a row, all catered and delivered by Red Robin. We had a great experience each and every day from their team. The burger bar came with tons of fresh toppings and sauces, making it customizable and different each day. The salads were fresh, and cookies were a hit. The best part was that the Red Robin team was early each day, friendly, and stuck around to help set up the lunch for the event. We were more than thrilled with the food and service, and will definitely be using them again.<//Review>< pictures>

3rd time around I fill out their survey telling them they set their AC too low (even when cold outside like last night) and is not enjoyable to have dinner while freezing.. not likely to return.. apparently their surveys are a joke and no one pays attention.. seems to me they want to eat fast, pay up and leave quickly< /Review>

You can always find a reasonable deal and the rewards program is excellent. The best part is that they have gluten free buns so my wife can have a good burger. It’s not fancy but it’s red Robbin, you know what you’re getting and it’s very reasonably priced.< /Review>

< Review>
We usually eat in the bar area, but had one of the kids with us today and ate in the restaurant. The food was fine, but the place was filthy! Our table had a nasty, sticky substance on top and crumbs scattered around the table and benches. The floor EVERYWHERE was dirty. I asked for fries to come out early...that didn't happen. We also had to ask for drink refills. It was not busy in there and all of the staff we encountered seemed like they'd rather be ANYWHERE else; the DMV or a root canal, possibly.
The bar is always spotless and the waitstaff in there are wonderful.</Review>

<text>Went there for the birthday burger. Pretty much the only reason I go anymore. Burger looked unappealing when it came out. Grilled onions were barely browned. Bun was soggy and greasy.  Fries tasted stale. Server wasn't super attentive when we wanted our drinks and fries refilled. The electronic device, where you need to pay the bill, looked like it hadn't been wiped down for a month. Felt kinda gross touching the screen through the menus to pay the bill. Wanted a to-go box for the remainder of my GF's burger, but after waiting for our server for a while, we just cut our losses and left.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x809b21d688876d09:0xe7b3eaee00aba257<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Love the bottomless salad option, not sure if that is new or not as it had been years since we ate here.  It was really busy so service was a smidge slow, but understandable.  One batch of fries was kind of soggy, but 1 out of 6 isn't so bad, they were probably just rushing to get people food.< /review>< pics>

My husband and I have always enjoyed Red Robin. We recently moved up here to the Roseville area (from Santa Clarita, CA.). We are overjoyed that the Red Robin on Galleria Blvd. is just as wonderful as we were use to in So. Calif. The staff are friendly & prompt, never forgetting what is ordered or needed. The food is always cooked to our liking, servings are hearty & the temperature is appropriate.  Great restaurant! Great place to eat.</review>

I used to really like Red Robin. But the last few times the food hasnt been great. Those yummy steak fries that are endless were cold and gross. I got the tortilla soup the last time we went and it was filled mostly with a huge chunk of melted cheese and a little soup. My husband didnt enjoy his burger either.</Text>

<time>1545041414877</time><Rating>1</Rating><Review>It started off good. But then we got the service from hell. Our waitress kept coming by which was great, but when we asked for either more (unlimited fries - with at least 12 steak fries in our two baskets) or a refill of our drinks, it was taken care of by someone else. Our hamburgers tasted like it had NO flavor. The hamburger buns were old and stale tasting. When we asked for a box to take our left overs, we were forgotten. Insted, she brings other customers their boxes. She then turns to our table and asks "how is everything", all I could say was " we are still waiting for Bill". The manager when contacted even acted like she didn't want to here about it. Thia is not the first time having a REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE AT THIS LOCATION. I will not be returning back to this location. I'll go to taco bell or McDonald's.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Don't go here!  Tried to charge my card at the table then at the waitress stand but their computers were down so nobody's cards would work so I paid cash. Got home and had 3 pending charges, 2 different amounts. Called them and manager Roberto said he found my transaction and would delete charge. Then I got another additional pending charge.  So 4 pending charges totalling $140 are being held on card after I paid cash.  This is ridiculous and makes me think they are being hacked or their system has major flaws or waitress doesn't know how to use system. Asked to speak to store manager  by phone and he's not available for over a week? Really?? Wow! Will keep an eye on my card for charges to disappear and WILL NOT BE GOING BACK HERE. Waiting to hear back from District Manager.<//review>

Decent food for decent prices. I hate the noise at this chain. We travel a lot, though, and it is nice to have a place where I know that I can find safe, gluten-free food. The gluten-free buns are some of the best that I have had, and I can actually eat the unlimited fries.<//text>

I usually give red Robbin 5 stars. I decided to get  my free birthday burger today. I asked the host before ordering if she needed a print out or to see the email from my phone. She said no all I need is your phone number. So I placed my order and she went to put it in. She came back to me and asked if I had been there today. I said no this is my first time here today. She walks off, I logged into the account and  and pulled up my birthday burger while waiting on her to come back. She came back to me and said I'm sorry our system is messing up today. She said the order went through and will be out shortly. I was upset and felt horrible because there were other people in the lobby looking at me as if I was trying to get over on the Red Robbin that's not my character at all.<//review>

Food was good. Service was also good.  The one thing we noticed WAY BEFORE we even went inside was how dirty the front door was!! Smeared with funk from dirty hands and soda. There was a sticky Spot that you had to pry your foot off before you walked in.  Other than that,  it was okay.<//Text>

We had a waiter still in training but he did very well. Another waitress came around to check on us too in case he missed anything. The round booth we were in was a little dirty from the guests before us. The bottomless fries weren't filled fast enough and I wish they were because that's what this restaurant advertises. Overall, it was still a great meal with my sisters.  Everything tasted good and our drinks came out fast.<//Review>

Red Robin is always good if you're craving a burger. I love the bonsai burger with there awesome teriyaki sauce and a pineapple slice. Their Royal Robin with an egg is yummy, and you get bottomless fries, and a tower of onion rings. This Red Robin has excellent service, today our server shared in our excitement of purchasing a wedding dress, and even brought the bride to be a sundae with a flag that said congratulations. Come to this restaurant, and request Natashia as your server.</review>

Red Robin is not as good as they used to be. The bottomless fries aren't really bottomless, we asked for more it took till half way thru our visit to get more. The atmosphere is good here, lots to look at and our waiter was really good.</review>

The food is delicious but I sometimes have issues with things I order getting to my table. Seams like with large groups, random items don't actually get ordered and sent to the table. When I've gone with a small group, everything goes fine.</Text>

Great crispy chicken salad for me, yum! Nice variety on the menu for everyone else, good kids meal options, not that busy when we went later in the evening on a weeknight.  Food was a little slow, but our service was great otherwise.< /review>

The worker we dealt with was rude and very unprofessional. We went in to eat and we were being told we could not have our stroller in the eating area because it is a fire hazard. She proceeded to speak very unkindly and was complaining. The manager came to see what was happening and he said to give us the seats that are stroller accessible. If she would have said there was a wait for the seats with stroller access it would have been alright. Just because we were using our stroller we were discriminated against. If you have a stroller DO NOT GO TO RED ROBIN!! it’s not a family environment!! If I could leave no stars I would!</Review>

Food and service has been going downhill for a while now. This last visit will be my last. I'm convinced that the cooks don't know what they're doing and definitely can't cook an egg correctly, even if their lives depended on it. Our server actually had to go back to the kitchen to cook the egg that goes on the Royal Burger. I'll post a picture of the egg that actually came on my burger and believe it or not, this one wasn't the worst one I've gotten. It's sad to see the downfall of this establishment because I used to love going there and the food was very good, but something is now terribly wrong with this restaurant chain. It will probably be out of business soon.</text>

<text>Food was good. I docked two stars because service wasn't the best. Our server never offered refills on our bottomless fries or drinks. We asked for boxes and it took them quite a while to come. Opted to get dessert elsewhere, and paid using the machine on the table so we could finally leave.< /text>< Pics>

Food was mediocre, fries were cold and burgers were lukewarm. The wait time was very short and the waiter tried his absolute hardest to make my table have a great time. He was excellent, the rest of the visit was less so.<//Review>

<text>The burgers are always excellent as is their selection. I like that they offer an egg as a burger topping as it is one of my favorite burger toppings but it is hard to find a burger place that offers it. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is that it is near impossible to get a refill on your fries here. I usually ask for an extra basket when the food is brought to the table and it still takes 20-30 minutes to get a simple refill of fries. Bottomless steak fries are a staple of Red Robin's but for some reason, at this location, it is always like pulling teeth to get your fry refill.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>First time eating at this location.  They didn’t have the impossible burger available.  The Pineapple sprite had nothing pineapple about it.  When asked for a military discount server said “we don’t give discounts our food is already so cheap”.  Funny because is @ a different location we were able to get a military discount and a “Thanks for your service”.  Won’t be going back.< /Text><GmapID>0x809b21d688876d09:0xe7b3eaee00aba257<//GmapID>< Rate>

Poor service.  I understand that people can be new, but we had to ask for everything.  Only good thing of the night was the 2 appetizers we ordered and the 2 kids meals..  The burger I ordered was cold, nasty and tasteless.  Waitress seemed put out when I told her I ordered the chips instead of fries.  As for the bottomless side item.  Forget it.   Wasted $71< /Review>

<text>I've come here multiple times and every time I'm highly dissatisfied withh the service and the food. Today I came because that's what everyone wanted but it was definitely the last time. I'm completely done with Red Robin and the horrible "service" that was given. The food is definitely not worth the money. The fries are okay but it would be great if you didnt have to wait 20 minutes to get more on these so called "bottomless" fries.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Plenty of good burger places out there to choose from.< /text><response>None<//response>< UserId.>

Good food . Went for my birthday couldn’t get my free birthday burger . Kinda has a ridiculous process to get it . . So because of that didn’t get my birthday burger as advertised. They have a process to get it but they do a horrible job to show that . Then they tell you after the fact . Witch is irritating ( Guess just showing your ID like Denny’s is too hard )

Also was very stingy with bottomless anything. With the initial dishes we barely got fries and when we asked for more ( after doing everything to get our waiter to get to our table ) they barely gave us fries . You could literally count the fries with one hand and still have fingers left over. And they didn’t even bother with our drinks . They never were around enough to even ask . Plus they Got my burger wrong to the point I didn’t care anymore.

It’s just irritating especially I was just trying to enjoy my birthday. Overall good food . Service and birthday policy could improve and be less stingy with bottomless anything.<//review>

<Text>Sara is an amazing server. She pretty much knows what we order and is super friendly and upbeat. The only problem we had this time was a grilled cheese sandwhich was burned and it tasted that way. The rest of our meals were on point.  Hopefully mext time we come in, all our food will be on point.< /Text>< Pictures>

Food was good.  Staff was pleasant but the place was a mess.  Friday for lunch and we got there at noon.  The place had been open for one hour.  The restroom looked dirty.  Floors were dirty.  Counters wet.  No seat covers in one of the stalls.  We saw a menu on the floor of the restaurant and saw various staff members walk over it multiple times.  Same with a children's place mat.  Finally a patron picked that up while wrinkling her nose.  As I said, the staff seemed pleasant but detached.  Like maybe that wasn't in their job description.  Just a weird experience.  Not awful just not enjoyable.</text>

service was questionable until Savage stepped in!!! She cleaned off a table for us, sat us, then waited on us. Even had the kitchen make us fries while she got our order! She made this visit amazing! Friendly, funny and honest. She's the reason we'll go back to this one.< /text>

<review>For those of you who go here and don't know what to get. The royal red Robin Burger and one onion ring tower is the best combo to get perfectly full. I love coming to this red Robin because the environment is great and so is the service. A+ rating! They never let us down. Would recommend for all.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Food was good but the waitress kept asking if I needed help with the on table kiosk.  Once maybe, but 5 separate times? We were trying to relax at little and have a bit of family time. Kind of felt like she was trying to rush us out.</Review>

<review>I left my camera there when I was in the area for the weekend. They quickly sent it to me within days. THANKS to their Management staff for getting this done quickly. The service when I was there was also EXCELLENT. Great service is one of the reasons why people come back. Will eat there again whenever I come to visit in the future.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>4< /Rating>< name>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Would not even give it a 1 star. The last few times we have been here,  they say bottomless fries but you get a half a$$ed full little basket of fries and no one shows up again to refill anything. Its a total gimmick.
Bad service too. Hit your light and no one shows up but passes right by and ignores it. 😕<//text>< pics>

Great big hamburgers, I never go away hungry. The restaurant used to have a lot more decorations, posters and memorabilia on the walls before they redecorated it while back. The new remodel isn't much to brag about. I eat here with my son at least four times a year for the last 15 years. They used to bring out good portions of fries and keep them coming. Now it takes more time to get a refill on your endless french fries and the portions are much smaller. So if you like their fries, ask for them early and often.<//Review>

<Review>Me and my wife were seated and waited 30 minutes, no waiter so I walked up and said we need a waiter. Waiter came 5 mins later. Took our order. Didn't even ask how we liked our burger cooked (pink or no pink). While others who came in only 10 mins got their their drinks and their bottomless fries. He didn't even bring us fries. Then brought our burgers over cooked and dry. Fries were over cooked too. Not only was the service bad but so was the food. Jon was our server.< /Review>< rate>

< Review>
We’re visiting Beale AFB and ventured out to Roseville for some lunch and had a great experience at this lovation today. Our server Lauren was so friendly and such a great server, we sat in the bar and ordered a couple of appetizers and drinks to start off with and just wanted to sit and relax and she was checking on us just enough! Not intrusive and not slacking either. Our food was tasty and our entrees were HOT AND FRESH. The rewards stuff was down in their ziosk system so Lauren went out of her way to print our receipt and highlight what we could do to make sure we still get our points on our account.

With knowing it was my son's birthday and we used his free birthday burger on him they still didn't offer to sing nor did they give him a scoop of ice cream yet everyone else got that. Everytime we go here something is wrong and or we have to wait a long time for something simple like extra napkins, I finally just get them myself.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x809b21d688876d09:0xe7b3eaee00aba257< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The food was pretty good, but it took us 30-40 minutes to finally get our check after we had finished eating. It wasn't that busy either. Probably won't be back.<//text>

<Review>Their pretzel appetizers with caramel sauce is to die for. Depending in the server will depend on your visit, most of the time we get a pretty good table and server but this last visit wasnt super great, our server didnt pay a lot of attention to us and helped other larger parties. We were even seated next to the kitchen so they couldn't miss us, at one point something was dropped and splattered on me, thankfully just in my arm and I was able to protect my new white shirt. We had to ask another server to get us some sauce since ours neglected us. Other than that they have some pretty killer food.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809b21d688876d09:0xe7b3eaee00aba257</gmap_id></record>

<review>So, came tonight because my kids love coming here. We typically drive past the Lincoln location and go to roseville though because the service here is traditionally poor. Tonight was no different. It took 10 min for our server to even come to the table. We were brought o-rings with no plates. Apparently they were out. We asked for plates again a few minutes later and were told the appetizer plates were being cleaned. We asked for any plate they had and were told they had none. My kids shared the plate the utensils came out on to be able to start eating. Food was brought out ok, they magically had an extra plate for my kids that were sharing. We were out of drinks for the full meal, no refills were ever offered. We had to ask twice for our refills of the Mac n cheese. We come expecting not so great service and tonight met our expectations. We will continue to drive past here.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Won't be going back. Took awhile to be seated just because they only had one waiter. We only know why because we overheard. They left us sitting in the lobby of an almost dead restaurant with a 5yo with no updates. Then the lobby was super dark, too dark to color the kids menu. Chicken was unseasoned. Kept having to ask for more "botomless" fries. Asked for ranch at beginning of meal, reminded them twice during meal, finally got it after we were done eating. They had baloons for kids but didn't offer us one, so it wad more of a tease.< /Review>

<Text>Red Robin is a titan that has fallen far from where it stood. I remember 10 plus years ago when going to Red Robin filled my young heart with excitement, however, not it seems like an empty husk of its former self. The food is mediocre at best, with their menu seemingly being downsized from what it used to be. The staff seem inconvenienced to take your order, let alone bring your drinks in a timely manner. After being asked about our appetizer that we order 15 minutes prior, we were told that it would come out with our entrees, which I dont need to explain the fault of this thinking process. After our meal showed up, the last time we saw our server is when she brought the check. This is a classic case of "Dont meet your childhood heroes". Unfortunately I would recommend to avoid this chain with a 10 foot pole, far from what it used to be.<//Text>< pictures>

Surprisingly, this Red Robin branch in Roseville was very clean and had very nice waitresses. Comparing this Red Robin to others I’ve been to, the dishes seem to be bigger servings. Now it’s may just be me but that’s what it seems like anyways.</Review>

<text>Ate at the Roseville location with my daughter and it was fantastic. It was busy but we still got in quick. They served me a free gourmet burger which was fantastic. One of the best I have ever had. I got it free because they served it to Veterans for free, lunch, dinner. Thank you Red Robin!!! We will be back!!!< /text>< Pictures>

Love the bottomless fries, atmoshere, service and burgers!  The only thing that makes me not give it 5 stars is the strange after taste things have..especially the fries..Can't figure out what it is..MSG maybe? But it's so strong it's the only thing I think of when I think of Red Robin now.< /Review>

Love the food, but the service can be "hit or miss."  If there is a problem with the service, it's usually that our server doesn't come around.  The food is typically prepared correctly, but the server may not come around to refill drinks or fix any issue with the food until the food is cold or gone.

I will say, though, that many times when management has been informed of an issue, they've always come by to make things right.  This poor service we've received definitely isn't a reflection on the entire waitstaff.<//Review>

Red Robin burgers are great. The service at this location has been consistently low quality, inattentive, and sometimes rude, well below what you would expect from sit-down burger place. On my last visit I spoke with a manager and shared my concerns. His response didn't contain an apology or any incentive for me to return to this location.</text>

Good food, but crazy busy, always. The servers are great, food is proportional to the cost, but tables are typically a bit dirty. As a general rule, I tend to not wait 30 minutes to be sat for a burger and a beer. If you want food quickly, not a good place.</Text>

We got there, order our food.. waited almost an hour still no food.. our server didn’t come back to check on us or let us know what was going on with our order, instead he sent his fellow lady co worker that works in the “bar” she said to explain that our order somewhat did not show up on their system and blame the computer! Really?
But people that order after us got their food.
Umm ok..
And then a “manager” came in his name Jorge (HORHE)
“Trying” to apologize again, and this time he blames it on how they gotten busy and our order was not put in in their system/computer. It is not an excuse to blame the “their busy” when clearly people that order after us got their food. And they weren’t busy AT ALL. I will NEVER come back and I REFUSE to give red robin my money. JUST CLOSED THIS LOCATION. Period!
This red robin needs more training when it comes to their SERVICE, because they are lacking on that department. They also need to know how to handle this kind of situation. Worst red robin i’ve been to. I will be calling corporate, this is unacceptable.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Red Robin burgers are great. The service at this location has been consistently low quality, inattentive, and sometimes rude, well below what you would expect from sit-down burger place. On my last visit I spoke with a manager and shared my concerns. His response didn't contain an apology or any incentive for me to return to this location.</text>< Pics>

Good food but garbage service. Last time i went here I had to get up and refill my own soda. I was watching the waitor goofing off in the kitchen with his co-worker and not refilling our fries or drink. I decided to give it another chance today.  My girlfriend and I just left the restaurant because we were seated for 15-20 mins and no one came to take our order. Never will go to this red robin again unless it gets new management.</review>

The food was good, but the service was entirely mediocre. The waitress didn't check in on us, we had to ask twice for fries, they weren't refilled after we finally received and ate them, I had to go up front to ask a manager for a box to go, and this happened when the were only handful of patrons eating.< /Text>

One of my go to for good gourmet burgers. Can't beat their bottomless fries and will never get tired of their freckled strawberry lemonade. Our last waiter wasn't as friendly though.< /Text>

The place advertise bottomless fries. So your craving for fries and place offers bottomless fries. That what your expecting, right. Well they dont serve a basket anymore. They give a handfull on this square plate with your hamburger. Dont get me started with the hamburger. Anyway, so i ask can i have more fries.The employee retreive me , it was a basket, and i counted ten fries . So left the place with a fry craving. Had to go to Mc Ds for a large fry! Star minus in my book!!</text>

Service was okay. Problem was with Roseville location is that the place was filthy.  To the point we almost walked out after sitting down. Blinds looked like never dusted, table, touch panel looked like they were cleaned with dirty, greasy rags.
Apparently after telling some friends the story,  they all agreed having similiar experiences at this location. Close the restaurant and send a cleaming team in! My daughter loves Red Robin, we will avoid Roseville location though unless cleaned up!</review>

I guess management was trying to save money by cutting back on wait staff because service was dreadful albeit the food server did her best to get us our food in a timely manner. And forget the house red wine: I think the horse had TB!<//Text>

Until I tried it a second time recently. There was no wait and we got seated right away. Unfortunately the spot they sat us at was right under a strong vent that was blasting us with cold air. We sat and waited for 10 minutes before we eventually got up and left. No one even bothered to come and take our order or ask if we needed drinks. We ended up having lunch at Blast 825. I haven't been back here since then.<//review></record>

I've gone here for years and the servive and food used to be top notch. The last 2 years have been hit or miss with the food quality but usually horrible service. Tonight the fries were overcooked, the burgers were decent and the seevice was just OK. We had 2 different waitresses and the 1st was attentive until our food came. Neither one made sure we had utensils or napkins and I had to wait 20 minutes to get those. I hate leaving bad reviews but Red Robin really needs to get their act together and train their staff to higher standards.< /text>

Service here is always slow. Servers change constantly creating confusion when trying to pay split bills. They actually charged us for another table and then charged us twice on top of that! The manager tried to solve the major problem by throwing gift cards at us. Avoid this place and eat at one of the 10 competing burger places in town that deserve your hard earned money.<//review>

Worst restaurant experience I've had. Ordered online at 640pm, says it will be ready by 708pm. Waited until 800pm and received cold food that's disgusting. About an HR wait for cold food.</Review>

Then we asked for the corn dogs kids meal (9) for our kids to split along with another basket of fries, and sure enough they forgot the fries. Write it down, if you cant remember it.< /review>< resp>

This review is for the dining out customers. Ordering lunch here is a nightmare, the orders are always incorrect. This not a single occurrence either. This happens every single time. Attention to detail isn't too much to ask for. I understand multiple orders does cause confusion, but everyone is no excuse. Very unsatisfied and disappointed.</Text>

<text>Well don't call the curbside number for them to bring your food out unless you want to be forgotten about and your food to be cold. I usually never use the number for the curbside pick up, but today I wasn't feeling well and decided to try it (I usually just go in and get my food). Well today I called and they said they would bring my food out. I sat an waited for awhile and just figured my food wasn't done yet. After about 20 minutes I went inside and my order was just sitting in a basket. Needless to say im super unhappy and my food wasn't even warm anymore and they also messed up my order and i didnt realize it till i got home. if it wasn't for the waiter being super nice in would have given 1 star not 2. Also if it was busy I would have understood, but the place wasn't....<//text><rating>2<//rating><UserId.>114354243197945968347</UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Just OK at this location. When food was served, my hamburger was a little cold, and the meat was dry, I've had better, Red Robin is not the same as it use yo be. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the food this time.< /text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Granted I'm leaving this review six months after the fact... My family and I all got severely sick after eating here. Not only was our food cold when it came out to us, it took an hour to get our orders and our drinks were never refilled. My husband had ordered a hamburger and got hardly any fries with it. I was 5 months pregnant at the time and I got very sick, my two year old son got very ill, and so did my husband. Needless to say we have no intention of every returning to this restaraunt. I've been to several different Red Robin's and have never been very impressed with the food anyway.</Review><name>Desiree N G Jackson</name>< pics>

Food and service was good as usual, just really really expensive for our family for what we got. Close to $70 for 2 adults and 3 kids.< /Review>

Burgers are good as you would expect. Thier fry policy has suffered. They bring you out approx 8 fries. Then you are stuck waiting for another 8. They are good but it is annoying to have to keep ordering.< /Review>

The burger was ok, but it wasn't worth buying two drinks and another entree for the free Tuesday burger deal (especially when you upgrade to get the better burger).< /Review>

<text>Food was ok, typical for a chain. They give you 'bottomless fries' but they bring you like 5 at a time. I ordered soup which was OK but was in a bowl just a bit larger than an ashtray. While the food was ok, it's obvious this place is run by corporate America. OK to go to if you're in a hurry and just need to grab a bite, but it's not a destination.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I hope I just caught them on a bad night... Fridays are very busy in this area.  The wait was long, which I expected, but it took forever for them to take our order, they were out of the pizza my kids wanted, and I never got a refill on my water.  When my burger arrived, it was smaller than the picture looked, and was generally disappointing in taste.  All that said, they were very busy; so I may go there again on a non-Friday night.< /Text>

<review>I love eating at Red Robin, just moved into the Roseville area. I was craving Red Robin, so my husband and I went the service was so bad! Waitress was rude, she would interpt me when I was talking. Tables were dirty, emplyoees just standing around talking to each other, she never asked if we wanted more fries, when I finally asked for more fries she brought out BURNED fries, and no ranch after I asked like 4 times! So disappointed, not going back😢</review><rate>1</rate><Name>Tania Cole<//Name><time>1490846805344< /time></record></dataset><record>

Worst service ever!  Even though we went right at opening time and there were only 5 tables with customers, our service was horrid!  We asked for ranch with our burgers and "endless" fries.  The ranch was not brought to us before we were done with our fries.  We asked for more fries and never got them!  We had waited for 20 minutes before giving up. I wont be going back :-(</Text>

We had ask for things several times. The bun was real dry. Had to get the manager just to get bill and a to go box, after sitting there for about 20 to 25 minutes waiting.</review>

We are not that picky but this was terrible service and terrible food. I think Red robin has been sliding backwards for a while in my opinion. We did not have our glasses filled once. We asked for lemons for the water. they never came. We finally had to ask someone else who brought them right over. not going back. Didn't seem to care much.< /text>

Red Robin is a chain so the food doesn't vary much. What I think is ridiculous though is the burgers are about a1/3 smaller than a few years ago and the price has gone up. The quality of the meat and produce has suffered as well. It's all about money not quality.<//Review>

<Gmap_id>0x809b21d688876d09:0xe7b3eaee00aba257< /Gmap_id><Text>Ordered your onion rings for take out. The gal in the bar who helped was very nice. Gave me what I asked for. 4 pkgs. knife,fork,spoons./w salt & pepper. I wanted salt. I needed the salt. Got my order to the car. I was starving so had a ring. Oh my god. They looked alittle to dark but I was in the car & it was night. But when I took a bite, I thought my teeth would start breaking. They where so 'crunchy' , hard!. And yes , they where very dark. I remember the rings there golden brown /w a soft crunch & tender onion inside.not so done that you could'nt see it! Needless to say I went home & finished the 13 rings. ALOT of the crunch in the bottom of the box /w a small pool of grease. They where still warm to the very last one. How do they do that & still keep the crunch?  Anyway, I will give them another try some day, inside.. with a burger. I'll ask for medium oinon rings.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< UserId.>

Waiting 30 minutes for food to arrive after ordering it is not a reason for it to be cold when they finally bring it to you.  This makes it difficult for a nice gratuity.<//review>

Fry's were cold, normally they're scorching. They changed the garlic fries and they are terrible now. Powered garlic, gross.

Our server was slow and forgetful. I'm a big tipper and they owed me after tonight's disastrous meal.<//Review>
