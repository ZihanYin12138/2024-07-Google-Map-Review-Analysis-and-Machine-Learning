We called and the locksmith showed up in less than an hour to attempt to open our Sentry safe. The safe had some mechanical and electronic issues but the locksmith was tenacious and finally got the defective unit open.
Despite numerous strategies being tried, the safe would not cooperate and ultimately the technician used heavy tools to open the unit but he knew where to attack so our closet near the safe was not destroyed.
The service was great and the price was reasonable considering the amount of effort expended on opening this horrible Sentry product. If you cannot get your defective Sentry safe open, call Lusky.<//text>

Lusky Locksmith promised me he could not only open my safe which had a dial combination lock on it (dial broken off) but would also replace the dial with a new digital lock. He worked around my schedule which fluctuated a bit as we coordinated a time he could respond. As promised he did a great job and left with a perfectly satisfied customer. This is the first time I have personally needed a lock smith service and hopefully the last, but if that changes I know who my first call will be to.  Thanks Lusky!</Text>

My husband and I have a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee that we recently purchased with both key fobs only partially functioning. They were able to reprogram both remotes as well as replace the rubber button overlay on one of the keys for only a fraction of the cost quoted by the dealership! Thank you for your amazing service.< /review>

<Text>Reliable, quick service. Highly recommend!
Apparently Honda has a common issue with key ignitions, and mine left me stranded on Fiesta Island. Luckily a quick call to Lusky Locksmith and they were there to help within 25 minutes. Price was fair, but more importantly didn’t have to tow my car to dealership to get it fixed.<//Text>< Pictures>

This was the fastest and most efficient locksmith I’ve ever dealt with. When he said he was 30 minutes away, he meant it. The pricing was fair and he made a new key quickly. I’d highly recommend him.< /review>

I have never felt better cared for from a company than I did at Lusky Locksmith. Not only are they extremely knowledgable, but they go above and beyond to help you out when you're stuck in a locked out situation. They are genuinely good, uplifting people who truly care about their customers.< /text>

I lost my keys to Toyota Camry and didn’t have an extra set. After days of searching, I called the dealer and they quoted me $435, not including the tow.           Lusky was referred by a friend, So I called on a Saturday morning around 11a. He was nice, helpful, and confident he could help me. He traveled from UTC to La Mesa and was there within 40 minutes.
He explained what he was doing while he did it, he was professional, and he was done within 45 min and I was on my way. He even said if someone returned my keys, he could reprogram it for cheap. I HIGHLY recommend to any and everyone.<//text>

<Review>I broke my car key and the dealer couldn't make a copy key for me. I was pressed for time. Mr. Lusky was able to follow me into Miramar Air Station and create a key for me in less than an hour. Great experience. He's mobile and can meet you to your location. Takes card and can make ANY key. Very happy with my new keys !< /Review>< pictures>

Yosi is a fantastic locksmith. Very professional, honest, and extremely hardworking. He is so polite and patient, taking time to explain his process and despite the difficulty of opening the safe he was tasked with, including the hard-to-reach location of it, Yosi greatly exceeded my expectations and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone. If you need a locksmith, Yosi Lusky is the professional you need to call!< /Text>

<Date>1623077718956</Date><review>Indy and Diana where so attentive to our needs and never did I feel that we were pressured at any moment. We set up an appointment and everything was explained clearly and we were able to see and go back home and think what would be the best plans for my husband and I. They kept checking back and seeing if we had any questions and they sought to seek for the best deal for us. I have definitely recommended them with friends and family.< /review>< user_name>

<Text>One of the best insurance agencies I have ever gone to, the concierge style service was great not only was I invited to come in for an account review but once I was there i realized I was not properly covered so we started an Umbrella policy and Life insurance they made me realize what was important for myself and my family.

The moment i walked in it was a very friendly and welcoming environment, I wanted someone who speak in spanish and they helped me. I got my car insurance through them and they saved me worry time compared to other places i have been insured with. They had no extra fees or hidden charges everything was very transparent. Definitely recommend.< /review>

<review>I have no hesitation in recommending Indy Mahindru if you are looking for an agent that provides and excellent customer service (available in three different languages no less) and the family care he provides to his customers is second to none. The insurance consultancy offered covers financial advising, legacy planning, home insurance and business insurance. Due to the current Covid19 restrictions meetings are organised through Zoom and Skype with a great degree of flexibility putting the customer's needs first with a very professional approach at all times.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x808de50251fec8bb:0x15eea77f977129c3</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I recently decided to join the State Farm family and I was not disappointed at all after my agent Diana J took such good care of me and helped me get the best deals and coverage. They will go above &beyond and will teach you about options you probably didn’t know such as life insurance and how beneficial it is.

I am privileged and honored to give my review on Indy, For his authenticity, His professionalism and being such a great representative of the state farm insurance and what it has to offer, I was very inspired not only of how he has displayed himself but also stressing the importance of having great insurance coverage for our family and God willing our own family business one day, I am honestly still trying to process and taking everything he has shared with us but we look forward to connecting more and continuing with a honest friendship and business relationship. So grateful< /review>

Customer service was great everyone was very friendly. Family oriented agency, Diana is the girl who initially helped me with the questions I had they let me know why it was better to have higher limits on your auto insurance which I never understood until being here now I know I am covered and won’t be personally liable for an accident.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I came to this office looking for a good rate on auto insurance they explained to me the coverages and discounts and I ended up having higher coverages than what I cam in eith they gave me that piece of mind that I can be covered in case anything were to happen, everything was explained to me in spanish and they helped me set up payments and roadside assistance. I was then also explained about renters insurance and how that can help me in case of any liability claims. Not only did I get that discount but my home is covered. Eventually they talked to me about life insurance which I didnt even know State farm had, they made it clear that not only should I have insurance on my car and home but on my life as well because of the difficult times.

If you are looking to buy into life insurance I definitely recommend going to this agency.

My family and I were searching more information about life insurance and feel blessed to have crossed paths with Indy and his staff. We were truly impressed by Indy’s professionalism and knowledge base. He helped us understand more about our options as well as the importance of making sure our children would be financially safe if God forbid anything were to happen to us. We purchased life insurance policies from State Farm because we felt heard, respected and safe with Indy.

Indy was attentive, responsive and demonstrated that he went above and beyond to ensure we were feeling satisfied with the process. I truly appreciated his patience answering all of our questions.

Thank you so much for the excellent service. You represent State Farm beautifully. Five star service all around!<//Text>

I wanted a lower insurance payment before coming in to the office but once I was there they told me about the difference in coverages and I walked out paying around the same but knowing I was actualky covered more than what i walked in with.< /review>

I wanted a quote on auto insurance only, but when i sat down and asked questions they explained to me why it was better to have higher limits and renters insurance. I walked out knowing I would be covered and protected in case anything happened.<//Text>

They responded in less than 24 hours which was very quick service! He was very patient, polite and very professional. He also answered all of my questions and assured all my doubts. It was evident that he was very knowledgeable as he knew exactly what I needed. I was provided with the best service and I could not have been more satisfied.

<Review>I was able to set up the right life insurance guided by Indy. He made my search for the insurance so simple, everything was broken down to me, explained every point in detail. Not only Indy helped me getting the right life insurance, he also helped me saving some $ by switching my auto insurance to state farm.
Indy got me all set up and transferred over in no time.  He even had some great tips about how to lower my rates in the future.
I love having an independent agent that I can actually talk to.  I know it's pretty old school, but it just makes me feel better.
Also he made my visit very safe during this pandemic by providing me with hand sanitizer when i walked in, sanitizing his work station and following the 6ft distancing the whole time.
Thanks Indy! I highly recommend this agency.< /Review>< Pictures>

Feel so fortunate to be connected with Agency that values their clients.
Indy helped me get a life insurance policy answering all my questions patiently. Must say Excellent selection of policies as to cost & coverage. Indy was very professional and made things really clear to me when he walked me through the process.

Thank you for making a difficult topic, feel so darn easy to get settled !!
Would definitely recommend them to family & friends.

Keep up the great job and more power to you & your team!!<//Text>

Indy may be new to area but not new to Insurance world. In fact he has redefined the concept of excellence in helping diverse clients with insurance requirements. Indy helped our family with umbrella policy covering life, auto and home in addition to business insurance. He and his team are highly customer focused, knowledgeable about different levels/types of insurance and helped create the right insurance package for us. Kudos to his multi-lingual team on their dedication, honesty and consistent efforts to deliver what was the best quote that I received after shopping for insurance with different agents and providers. There was no pressure to sell me unnecessary insurance policies. Indy came to my home, completed all necessary measurements and took into account all details, consulted me on how much insurance I would need in case of need, before providing a quote and same goes for my auto insurance.
He consulted me on amount and type of life insurance that would best suite my current/future needs rather than selling me most expensive one.
The business policy his team helped prepare, provides more coverage than the  previous one that I had with lower premiums. He and his team always responded to my calls after the policies were in place and were super helpful with submitting a claim.
Thanks Indy, Team and State Farm for excellent customer service and coverage.<//Text>

<review>This is an edit from a previous response I wrote a couple months back in August 2020. I did give this agent a good review (5 stars with a pleasant experience) because I explained the situation with my parents in regards to them getting automatically transferred to this office in Seaside. I explained that they do not want to come to this particular office because they rarely do any business out in the Seaside area. Their previous agent who they’ve been with for 20+ years was in Salinas and they want to stay in Salinas with whom their original agent got replaced with. With numerous calls to both offices in Seaside AND Salinas, I was getting bounced back and forth in regards to how to get my parents files back to the Salinas office. Finally I was able to talk to Indy and explained my parents requests. Indy understood the situation and said that there would be no problem with transferring their files back to Salinas. With a lengthy conversation with Indy, I had confidence that he would proceed with his word in transferring my parents back to Salinas. Now fast forward 2 months to today October 2020 I get a phone call from my mom saying that she received a letter from Indy’s office in regards to one of their policies. Both her and I are confused as to why there is a letter coming from that office? Come to find that my parents files ARE STILL IN SEASIDE AND WERE NEVER TRANSFERRED back to the Salinas office. At this point my mom is now starting to get really upset with the whole situation. We do not understand why their files are still in Seaside and why did he not transfer them when he said he would? I understand it takes some time but does it really take more than 2 months to transfer files??? I don’t get it and the frustration is getting worse!</review>< Pictures>

Just starting a family, and reached out for life insurance options and boy did Indy not disappoint! He was able to talk over the phone with me and lay out all my options, he works day and night to make time for his customers because he understands how busy our lives get. He broke everything down to make it easier to understand and had options for any budget. Him and his wife were so helpful, their customer service was better than I could have asked for. Life insurance is a big deal and they found ways to tell stories to make it easier to understand and put it into perspective. They have my business and will for life!</Review>

The best team around to work with for insurance! So I worked with Indy & his team members earlier this year and they explained everything to me regarding life insurance. I just graduated and got a job and never thought about getting life insurance because I am so young. But Indy explained to me all the benefits and I ended up purchasing it. I would totally 100% recommend him to my friends and family.
Also, they have really good coffee inside their office :)</Review>

Was a wonderful experience doing business with this insurance agency. I was able to get a prompt solution and Diana was professional and patient during the whole process. Would definitely recommend this agency for those who are looking for a great deal and great service experience.<//review>

Diana was the most helpful I was recommended by a friend who told me of how great they were when it came to meeting my insurance needs needless to say I was not disappointed and Jose  was also the other team member who has answered my phone calls. This is a very well coordinated team they came through they followed up as soon as my policy had been issued best agency</review>

I usually am not the one to put reviews on Google but I guess the service, the camaraderie that Inder’s team has built with me and my wife has forced me to genuinely share a review. I have been doing business with them since Nov 2019. Whether it is my property insurances or life insurance umbrella policies they have got it all covered. Having moved from India in 2017 I finally found someone I could trust. Thank you guys.</text>

When you call, request an agent by the name of Jose. He's a great agent who is both friendly and helpful.</text>

Diana really helped me out. She was very informative when it came down to telling me about different types of coverages and policies that would suit me. She offered me all the possible discounts which actually made me feel as if the agency cared. They are very friendly and answer all your questions.<//text>

I have travelled across country to many different states. I have never seen a goodwill selling used items that were donated, as if they were a boutique! 👎🏼
The prices for basic brand are extremely high! Price gouging is in this area is terrible! I will not be supporting this goodwill. Do you self a favor go to the Macy’s and by something new for this price.  This is supposed to be a goodwill we’re things are affordable. Who ever is managing this store needs get their act together and do something about this!!</text>

I am diaapointed in the price mark-up's and the fact that they took away dollar Sunday's. They get everything by donation and are a huge company. I feel they are losing the point the business was started in the first place. Maybe I'm not missing something.< /text>

This seems to be the place where the best quality clothing donations go in the Goodwill system. They have an entire area for quality label clothes and the sizing system makes it easy to find things. Every week a particular tag color is on sale and on Sundays they are $.99.< /Text>

I try the arrozcaldo and i was expecting like Philippines arrozcaldo because it’s filipino food restaurant.
but the taste is plain porridge 😤 you will do the taste😡
Philippine arrozcaldo is with the taste of chicken broth and flavorful..
better to change the name in the menu, put LUGAW..< /Text>

< review>
Worst customer service.  Staff are not knowledgeable
and not inform by their management about their online promotion.  Eventhough I have to show it on my email staff comprehension still don’t it.  Staff spoke in tagalog talking negative about me, they thought I don’t understand.  Store are not complying
about social distancing.  Staff is rushing me what else to get because they want to help their friends behind me.  I told them I’m not done yet I will order more.  I end up buying 2 items instead of buying more
suppose to be buying for 15 people.  It’s a nightmare experience.  Management needs to coach their staff well.< /review>

I needed a Birthday cake with a Spiderman motive the same day, the cashier said that the decorator was going to be in later on. The lady topk my information and payment and said to come back in a few hours. I went back and had a beautiful Spiderman cake ready to go, my son was amazed and very happy with the cake.<//Text>

<Review>Pork barbecue wasn’t I expected too not a real Filipino barbecue looks like they just put some mafran sauce. The banana q is hard and doesn’t taste as real banana cue.
Sorry but I won’t recommend this place to anyone at all,
Bad cook.
Maybe their pastry is good I didn’t have that

It's classic FilipinX food and a comfort for generations far away from home AND bring your own insulin. Last time mom had the fresh lumpia and the wrapper was tender and fresh. Vegetarian options were (expectedly) limited but the ensaymadas are exactly what we were expecting. This time we only had time to run in and out. Service at the bakery counter is quick and the pandesal were, just as the ensaymadas were, a perfect recreation of warm memories. Mom says the mungo hopia were also on point, I couldn't tell you I hate mung beans. If you have a minute and a sweet tooth swing in, you will not be disappointed!<//review>

Place is nice and friendly staff..only suggestion is as the winter approaching it's getting cooler inside, chairs and tables are cold and food were already cold before you finished. A portable heater will do.< /text>

I went today around 11am and the cashier didn't bother saying hi or anything after greeting him. He was on his phone and seemed like he hated his job. Work somewhere else if you don't like your job! But, the lady who handed my drink was super nice and had a nice smile on her face. Thanks to her and hire a new worker!< /review>

< Review>
Located on Top of the Hill next to Auto Zone in Daly City, Goldilocks serves turo-turo (point to what you b want) style. Their bakery boasta of many cakes for special occasions and there are pre-packaged delicacies you can grab to go as well.

If you haven't tried Filipino Food yet, try these guys!

Not only does the location have a clean eating area, the servers also understand the logic of cleanliness as seen in the way they handle your food.

Parking is free on site and it's an easy jump on the 280 freeway from there!

my favorite: UKOY

Thanks for reading my review!
Stay awake and alive.<//Review>

<Text>I decided to stop off and try the food and I will never return. The lumpia's are the Chinese version. The rice was very sticky and the adobo sauce tasted of to much salt.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Having a great selection of traditional dishes like Adobo and kaldareta, and famous for the beautiful and delicious cakes and Filipino pastries.  Love the siopao and ensymada and have been enjoying their mouth savoring pan de sal since I was a child!  Bibingka malangkit is a must try dessert!</text>< Pics>

I have been coming to this store since i was 6 years old and i am now 20. I have seen this store transition from owner to owner and the change in the layout through the years. I have even seen when they had a butcher and sold poultry and beef. Over this period of time i have slowly seen this store change into somthing completly diffrent from what i remember as a child and now it is like an ordinary dollar store. There is nothing that makes its stand out. It mainly caters to the locals who buy their daily needed items. I would have gave it more stars but it simply isnt a very good dollar store nor does it stay true to its price point.< /Text>

<Review>Same products you would expect from any "99 Cents" store in the area, its your average store to go to when you need a fast cheap temporary product, There is also a section where they have clothes that for some reason is usually closed off or seems closed but they will ler you in if you ask. There is a parking on the back which is too tight for large vehicles. This is not a bad store, but it does not deserve past 3 due ro the sale of Betta fishes which are not in good conditions, 99 cent stores are not good places to sell nor buy pets<//Review>< resp>

<Text>This was an ok Dollar store. After making my purchase, I asked to use the restroom. The answer I got was that they don't have a restroom for customers. I think that the 99¢ store up the street was much better.< /Text>< Pics>

This store is way better than any of the other ones I've been to! They are very professional and helpful, and they actually care about their customers! Stacy went out of her way to help me out, and she genuinely did whatever she could to make everything happen! Thank you so much!!!< /text>

<Text>Excellent customer service!
The treatment is with respect, I came to check out some why they are charging $4 to make my payment but they explained everything súper responsable and Set me to autopay so that way I save those 4 extra fees

the worst experience.i wanted to cancel a line that i have paying for about 6 months that i no longer need. i had my husband go to the store so they can remove it. he said they were trying to charge him $15 to remove a line. i couldnt believe it i went myself and they said the same thing besides the ugly attitude the girl had she said metro doesnt allow to cancel lines and if she was going to do it i had to pay $15. i ask for the manager name she said she couldnt provide it. My daughter has also made a complain about this store and nothing has been done. The sold her a phone the next day she wanted to return it and never gave her a reciept. Only a paper where they wrote on itand said that was a receipt with final sale in pen. I went to a metro in tustin and they said there is no such thing a hand write receiyts they were suppose to print one out and they also told me that my daughter was charged incorretly $120..when the phone was suppos to be free nd only pay $80.i dont understand my this placeis still open<//Text>

The best experience ever. Today i walk in with an issue on my cell and to my surprise the team member anna was very helpful. She has a great customer service. She literally went the extra mile fixing my problem. Thanks anna for a great customer service. You should get a raise or a big promotion for doing a great job. Congrats< /text>

GUYS I wouldn’t trust this place even the owner has to put fake reviews to make this place look “good”. Maybe hire good workers and have good customer service at this location and lying wouldn’t be an issue. Pathetic place.< /text>

These girls will do anything to get you out of the store with a smile!! I had a question regarding my plan because I had gone to another store and they messed up my monthly plan so this store helped me resolve the issue not only that but I even walked out with the latest moto G& power, you can tell they know how to do their job. Leaving everything at a great price even their cases :)</review>

I felt the two women that were there the evening I went very rude and disrespectful. They were hanging out outside. Slow to attend to me and my relative. And their bilingual skills were horrible! For that reason I rate their customer service so low.< /Review>

To be honest this place was way better than others I have been to. The people that helped were honest and straight forward and could figure out what I needed before I even asked. And they made clear what I was paying and what I would be paying for. I recommend this place.< /Text>

All I have to say is this Metro stands out from the rest. The employees go that extra mile to have us customers happy. Honestly this is how it should be when u walk in anywere employees with smiles great attitudes respectful and very helpful. I would highly recommend this Metro to my friends and family and i know they will come out satisfied and happy.<//Review>

the worst place to go. i went there bought hands free for my iphone. they did not even give me the reciept and i needed the regular hands free and these people cheated gave me the hamdsfree with bluetooth. i told them to check it they said its brand new and works for sure. when i get into my home and i checked them they were not working without the turning on the blutooth. i returned it back and reqiested them to exchange it for the handsfree i want or give me my money back cause i did not need the bluetooth handsfree. they were so disrespectful and they were refusing exchange and return. my god i was so shocked and mad. long story short i came home without exhange or any returned.
please do never go to this place. or do never buy anything from them<//text>

Charged me for phone cases as I bought my phone and they proceeded to sell a phone case separately. I did not notice because I was grieving over a lost family member but when I checked the next day they didn't not give me any detailed receipt of what I bought. ( Basically  they will steal money from you) NEVER GO TO THIS STORE!!!</Text>

But she informed me for that price I could be getting unlimited and so I did . No other store ever checked that !! I'm so happy with her advice and I decided to upgrade to the j7 and got a speaker .

This store is the store you go to if you want to get ripped off!!! And they don’t provide no receipt because they do not want you to see what they are over charging you for!!!! Which it’s illegal to not provide a receipt, that’s why I called weights and measures on them so they can get audit and finned also the federal-bureau of commerce!...  All those so called employees customer service sucks! They get all offended when you confront them about their rip offs!!! Never again will I deal with IRIS and ANA biggest rip off people at this location! Don’t let them bundle anything to your purchase!

Esta tienda es a donde van si quieren que les roben el dinero... son puras rateras...

Just noticed the girl that works there reviewed this store as great customer service ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️ IRIS RENDON IS A RIP OFF!!!!!!< /text>

I spend all my contacts and applications apart that opened are the only ones that open earlier than other meters by tmobile

Thanks to the lady I think she was the very friendly manager 😉

(Translated by Google) We went to buy a glass to a phone and a girl iso several attempts to put, but there were air balls, after several attempts we asked him to ask help to the short girl who already has more time there, just came to tell us that He sold it and we put it to him.
I answered that No and he only said how much they paid and he returned the money and he went overbearing.

Fuimos a comprarle un vidrio a un telefono y una muchacha iso varios intentos por ponerle , pero quedaban bolitas de aire, despues de varios intentos le pedimos que le pidiera ayuda a la muchacha chaparrita que ya tiene mas tiempo ahí,  solo vino para decirnos que nos lo vendia y que le pusieramos nosotros .
Le conteste que No y solo dijo cuanto pagaron y nos regreso el dinero y se fue prepotente .<//Review>

(Translated by Google) the worst place to buy cell phones or accessories. they are a scam. They say it's a final sale and they don't give you your money back. I do not know why give a star if what I want to put is a Madr3 window to this store.

el peor lugar para comprar celulares o accesorios. son una estafa. dicen que es venta final y no te regresan tu dinero. no se porque darle una estrella si lo que quiero poner es una ventada de madr3 a esta tienda.< /text>

I had a front and back glass on my iPhone that needed to be replaced. I took it to Smartphone repair and Shervin was able to repair my phone pretty quickly. Because the back glass of the phone was also cracked, it took an extra day for the part to come in.

The phone works great and will definitely go back for other repairs if needed.

Thanks for providing great service.</review>

<Text>I have visited Shervin and his business for over four years at two locations. He has helped in the replacement and repair of three of my phones, my daughter’s and my son. He has referred me to professionals when he could not provide the specific service for my phone. I again have problems with both my iPad and iPhone and Smartphone Repair is where I do my business< /Text>< Pics>

This was the best, friendliest and cheapest phone repair shop I ever visited! Shervin is very knowledgeable and replaced the glass on my Galaxy S9 while I waited. Highly recommend this place.</Text>

Awesome service! Replaced my iPhone 6 cracked screen with little to no notice. I call him, he got the part while i drove over and fixed it while i waited! He also includes a lifetime guarantee which can't be beat by most places whose repairs run at a much higher cost.

Highly recommend!<//text>

Shervin provides excellent service.  He fixed two of our iphones.  He provides honest, fast and professional service.  He is willing to pick up and drop off and is still less costly than others I have found in the area.   I highly recommend Smartphone Repair!!<//Text>

Called to get a quote for my son's phone and the guy answered and told me to bring in the phone to "see" what it is. I asked if he could call me back with a quote because I did not want to drive to Irvine to just "see" what the problem was when I already knew. The line was quiet after a few hellos. I called back and he out me thru to voicemail.  Wow... how rude.  You will never get my money at this point.  A little courtesy goes a long way.<//Text>

How wrong they were. Not only did this guy fix my phone but he also did it cheaper than the Apple Stores quote for a new iPhone 6s!
Also as a woman I often do not feel confident going into tech stores and often feel that I am being taken advantage of, for the first time in a long time I was treated like an equal, he didn't talk down to me, rather he explained what was wrong with my phone and gave me an exact quote before he undertook repairs.

I will 100% recommend this shop to my friends and family. I cannot rate them high enough!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Shervin is the owner of this place, I met him yesterday as I frantically needed to fix my shattered screen on my iPhone 4S.  I had dropped it earlier in the morning and needed it back because I had to use my phone for business throughout the day.
I received great service, my phone was fixed in less than 30 minutes and Shervin also fixed my volume down button that had not been operating for some time.
The fact that this business is open on Sundays is reason enough for me to return.
Thank you very much Smartphone Repair...</Review>< Pictures>

Honestly the only good thing I could say about my experience is that my screen isn't cracked anymore. I Called, and the guy assured me he could come pick up my phone and have it back to me within the hour. He came and picked up my phone and left, TWO hours later... I called and asked where he was. He said he'd be there within 20 minutes. 45 minutes later... I called AGAIN asking where my phone was and he said he was with other customers and had to make another phone call then he'd be on his way, sounding very frustrated that I was calling for a second time. (Which honestly, do I need to track you down almost 3 hours later wondering where you took my phone???) I only called to get my cracked screen fixed. The settings were changed, the entire screen is not as sensitive and sometimes doesn't work at all. He said it would probably be $70 but ended up being $95. I would have paid the extra $40 going to Apple and having it done correctly. Definitely learned my lesson here and please learn from my expirience and just go somewhere legit. He's sassy and sarcastic, and you won't at all feel like a priority. Sorry Shervin. I'm not happy.< /Review>

I had the worst experience with this company. This guy has no respect for his customers. The place smells like weed and the guy kept yelling to me in the store in front of people. He kept my phone for three days. I dropped my phone off on Saturday and didn't get it back till Monday. He kept lying saying he was working on it for three days when in reality, he just wanted to keep it till Monday because the store to buy the parts for my phone didn't open till Monday. He didn't call me the whole weekend and when he finally did I asked him why he didn't call me and he said I had the wrong number to reach you on. That was a complete lie. I saw him write down the right number to reach me on Saturday when I dropped the phone off. He just didn't want me to take my business elsewhere so he wanted to keep my phone for three days so he can fix it. When I got there he wouldn't give me my phone back so I told him I was gonna call the cops and he started yelling at me in his store in front of people saying that I'm "threatening him" by saying I was gonna call the cops and that I was "threatening his business." If he's doing nothing wrong he should have no problem with the cops coming. He will lie to you and say it might be $100 but he will always make it out to be $130 every time. You can get it fixed for the same price IN AN HOUR at the Irvine Spectrum down the street. I wasn't able to meet with a group project from not having my phone so now I will be getting an F on that part of the class. The guy is a complete liar about everything. I swore I would write this down as a review just to warn anyone else from going here.

After reading everyone else's posts on yelp, it also sounds like there's a reason it takes multiple days to fix everyone's phone. It sounds like he's taking out parts of the phones and selling them and putting bad parts in that are just gonna make the phone break or malfunction.</Text>

DON'T take your iphone 6 plus (or any phone) in here to be repaired. The screen he installed was faulty and didn't work properly, it costs more than the apple store to replace the screen ($135 compared to $129), and the overall store experience is very poor (smells like weed, dog running around, door locked and no one there during normal store hours, repair times much longer than he tells you).

I took my phone, iphone 6 plus, to smartphone repair to have my cracked screen replaced. It cost $135 and took about an hour. However, the newly installed screen consistently malfunction, so I took it back. He replaced my screen, but the problem persisted. He told me it was my motherboard.
So, I took my phone into an apple store to have it looked at. The genius there told me that my phone hardware looked perfectly fine, but the screen from smartphone repair was low-quality, had faulty connectors, and was the cause of the persistent malfunction. Since I had a 3rd party work on my phone, it voided my warranty. My options were to try another 3rd party screen replacement or trade in my phone. I  chose to trade in my phone.
I started out with a cracked screen, but fully functioning phone, and ended up having to replace it because of malfunctioning screen and voided warranty.

At the apple store, I learned its CHEAPER to get your screen repaired at the apple store than at smartphone repair, 135 compared to 129.

So, if your considering getting your iphone repaired here, DON'T. Go to the apple store. Its CHEAPER, EASIER, takes less time, won't void the warranty on your phone, and they use higher quality screens.< /Review>

I only rate it 1 star because that's the lowest the ratings go.  This is one of the shadiest businesses I've been to and experienced.  I never write reviews for anything, ever.  But I had to create an account so that I can describe the horrendous experience I had at Smartphone Repair.

I believe there are 2 or 3 guys working in this shop.  The name of the guy I worked with was Shervin.  I went in to replace an iphone screen and waited on-site until it was finished.  After waiting 30 minutes he cracks the replacement screen while snapping it in place and he does not have anymore screens in stock so he tells me that I have to go phone-less for the next day.

I go back the next day to pick up my phone and the home button does not work.  He has to open the phone back up to connect the wiring for the home button but he stripped the screw as he was working on it and can't get the phone open.  He then proceeds to drill into the screw head damaging the bottom of the phone in the process.  He opens the phone, makes the connection on the home button, then returns the phone back to me minus the screw that was damaged.  He does not have a replacement for the screw that he stripped.  He then asks for the full price.

He sees that I'm upset then claims that the new screen looks "beautiful" then tells me that it was my fault because I brought in a phone with stripped screws then starts getting very defensive.  This literally leads to a heated argument where he does not return the phone back to me and will not issue me a receipt (I had already given him the cash by this point).  Honestly, all I wanted to do is get out of there.

This was one of the shadiest guys I've ever had to deal with.  You may not have as bad as an experience that I had, but I would not want anyone to risk going through what I did.  I would rather buy a new iphone at full price then deal with sleazy business guys like this.<//Review>

I plan on coming back…when I break my next phone screen!  I broke my touch screen on my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I looked at several off-contract phones, but they were expensive or not much of a value.  Thought about replacing the touch screen myself; which I have done before but there were always issues (i.e. death spots on the touch screen).  Instead, called Shervin and had my phone fixed the next day at a great price.  Highly recommend Shervin (Smartphone Repair)

Jeff is a real professional. Arrives right on time, very friendly, properly masked during Covid And does some extra things without being asked. He’s just that kind of good guy that you like to do business with. And Angela, his wife who makes all of his appointments, is also super easy to get along with. I highly recommend them</review>

<review>Dr Clean is a very professional company. They responded quickly to an emergency situation at my parent's home. The water heater burst, flooding part of two bedrooms.
I went to google and found Dr Clean. I read about them liked what I read and as they had five stars I called them. Great decision! Spoke with Angela when I called and Jeff came out within a couple of hours, after normal business hours, assessed the job and began work immediately!! Turned out to be a bigger job than I thought it would be and included an insurance claim. Dr Clean did an awesome job  explaining what was needed. After working with them for a week or so we found out that they are a family-owned business. We love supporting local businesses. Their work is impeccable and we will definitely use them again for carpet cleaning and recommend them to everyone for any kind of carpet cleaning or repair job.
We were very very happy with their work and were pleased with their high work ethic. Thank you Dr Clean.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I’ve used Doctor Clean for over 2 years now for our carpets after being referred by a friend to their service. Enough good things can not be said of them. Their communication and personal care is refreshing to deal with and they have always arrived on time or early. The quality of their services is beyond affordable and technicians very personable.

<Review>Often times I leave the house while they are cleaning and I have never had to worry about them being trustworthy.

There is a lot of foot traffic at my home and the carpet is quite dirty.  It essentially looks brand new when they are done cleaning.  I am particularly happy when they apply the protectant.

I highly recommend Dr. Clean.<//Review>< pics>

They are the best. I have a stone path through my living room that I have been unable to get clean for several years. They came in and had it done in an hour what I could not do for several years. They’ve also been cleaning my rugs for many years and have always done an amazing job!</review>

Showed up early as requested, got straight to work and efficiently and thoroughly cleaned the carpets to brand new. I had to leave during the cleaning and felt very comfortable leaving my home in their hands. They even locked up prior to leaving. When I arrived home I was extremely pleased with the results and even found more to be done than what I had asked for, which just should the attention to detail. Definitely recommend!</Text>

Important for me was that the carpet was not wet and soggy after Jeff was completed.

I have been a customer of Doctor Clean since 2012. I always have them clean my office rugs and they do a wonderful job. The method they use allows the rugs to dry faster so my office isn’t closed on normal operating days. I highly recommend this local company.< /text>

Prompt, helpful, friendly. Hit the estimate exactly and pre-treated to help with dog stains. Carpets haven’t dried yet, but already seems like it’s going to work great. Very clean. Got my living room carpet to white! :)< /Review>

<Review>I have used Doctor Clean for over ten years, they are the best carpet cleaners in the Bay Area. They really know how to get your carpet, rugs, upholstery, and cars interior clean. If you have a stain that you think won't come clean call Dr. Clean, they have the tools and knowledge to get the job done.</Review>< user_name>

We had Jeff at Doctor Clean come to clean our carpets and were amazed at the job he did.  Carpets looked almost new even though they were 20 years old.  He arrived on time and was a very friendly gentleman.<//Text>

He went the extra mile and was extra thorough. Plus he answered our questions and gave extra details when asked.  We walked into the appointment anxious, walked out feeling like we knew what we were getting into during the purchase of a home. Great reporting software that makes reports available very quickly and in a web based and/or pdf based format. He earned our repeat business. You won't be disappointed.< /Text>

Jason was super professional and very thorough. We felt that he did such an excellent job and gave us a very clear understanding of everything going on in the house. We had gotten a quote from another company that was a bit cheaper but Jason was worth every penny.<//Review>

If you need an inspection that is through and detailed hire them immediately. This inspection saved us from buying a home that was nice on the outside but a hazard under the hood. We will hire them again for our next home inspection.</Review>

I am a first time home buyer and every step of the process has brought upon stress. But with Jason at Citrus Home Inspection, that went away for a moment. Jason was punctual and very professional in his appearance and mannerisms. The quality of his instruments is on par with the quality of his work, which is backed up by his knowledge of building construction. Jason took his time to go over the details of the inspection at the end and the report he sent us was top notch, with detailed descriptions of concerns and high resolution pictures to back up his findings. I will never suggest another home inspector. If you need a home inspector today, you have found him. Worth every penny. Thanks Jason!< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Jason helped us with a mold inspection when we prepared to bring a chemotherapy family member home from the hospital and wanted to eliminate any risks. We needed someone ASAP and Jason made himself available. He was very thorough, very professional, very congenial. In addition to observation, he made good use of scientific equipment in his inspection and shared his findings as he went along.
The follow up report was issued in a timely manner as he promised, and it was well organized and easy to read.

As is probably obvious by our comments above, we would not hesitate to recommend him to friends, family or for our future needs. Although we were focused on potential mold issues, he would be our #1 recommendation for any home inspection.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Jason provided more value than the typical inspector I have used in the past. First, he was on time and spent more time at the house than I expected. The value of the report was first rate, but more, he spent considerable time reviewing all issues with us before We departed. I had some follow up needs, and Jason was prompt and professional in providing assistance required for our lender. Jason’s knowledge, complete reporting, and professional demeanor were great. I would recommend him to anybody and will use him again.<//Review><user_name>Bob vesely<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Citrus Home Inspection went above and beyond inspecting a new property that my husband and I were purchasing. They were very thorough when inspecting and gave a detailed report on anything they found in and outside of the home. We were very impressed that they used a drone to photograph the roof of the home to allow us to see things we wouldn’t have been able to do so otherwise. They were professional, kind and  answered all of our questions we had. We would highly recommend their services to anyone!</Review>

Jason did an amazing detailed job during our home inspection.  The result of his work revealed some significant findings that others may have passed up and not taken notice of.  This allowed me to make a rational and economical decision to not move forward with the purchase of this particular home.  After putting pen to paper on Jason's finds and recommendations, my wife and I would have spent well north of $20,000 to bring the home up to a turn key standard.   As I noted above, Jason's price was higher than I expected, but surely well worth every penny.   Thank you Jason for saving us ton of money down the road.  Bob D.< /review>

My experience with Jason Agre at Citrus Home Inspection was beyond amazing. I hired Jason to inspect a home I am purchasing. This is the 5th home I've purchased in my lifetime, and I have never had a more comprehensive, exhaustive, and complete report. As well, I have never hired a friendlier, more communicative inspector. I rarely post reviews, but felt compelled due to the quality of work and service I received. Beyond top notch! I highly recommend.</text>

<text>In the process of buying our first home and we were put in contact with Jason. He called us immediately, explained the process, and answered all questions I had in thorough detail. He kept in contact with me during the whole process and when I showed up near the end of the inspection he walked me through and showed me each room, all points of interest, and answered everything every step of the way. His report was professional and all incline he followed up to make sure I was taken care of and had everything I needed. I will continue to go directly through this company for any needs I have in this department and will refer any friends and family to this company. My family can't thank Jason enough for his timeliness, professionalism, and customer care.</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

We are in the process of purchasing a home in Big Bear, CA. Citrus Home Inspection (Jason) completed the inspection and report. What a positive experience! Jason is professional, personable and very thorough.   Since we were on the property during the time of the inspection, he gave us a verbal "big picture" of what he found. We received the final report today, and it's beautifully prepared, with easy to understand narrative accompanied by great visuals. We know what needs to be addressed by the current owner, and what we can hack away at once we take ownership. We would never have predicted that the home inspection would be one of the most positive parts of purchasing the house!<//Text>

Jason was a total professional throughout the entire process.  He provided very thorough feedback and recorded any potential issues or code concerns.  His digital printout was very informative and was instrumental in closing my offer.  The format is even user friendly for agents as it allows for them to be included to pull directly from the report for repair request.  I would recommend Jason and Citrus Home Inspection to anyone out there.  Military friendly business with quality performance.<//Review>

As a realtor it is imperative that you use a home inspector that you can trust - Jason is just that. He is extremely knowledgeable.  He is a consummate professional, takes his time to explain to my buyers and sellers every detail. His reports are detailed and accessible, usually within 24 hours.  Jason is at the top of my list when it comes to home inspectors!< /Text>

Jason was timely, professional, courteous, and provided a thorough inspection of my prospective home. He answered all of my questions and pointed out several things that I may have overlooked. At the conclusion of his inspection he sat down with me and pointed out what would be included in his report and, again, answered my questions.

In a matter of hours, I received Jason's very thorough, detailed report, including photographs and recommendations. I would highly recommend Jason for any home inspection needs you may have.< /Review>

<Review>Jason did a very good job on our inspection. He was there before he said he would be and he left hours later. He even stayed extra hour to walk my client through some of the trouble parts of the home. It's nice knowing you can rely on someone to do the right thing. Plus they offer some other incentives that other companies don't offer. Great guy great company and was even less than some competitors.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Jason Agre did a fabulous job for me. He went through the house examining every inch inside and out. It was almost discouraging how many issues he highlighted. But, as he correctly pointed out, that is what we ask him to do. His report was easy to follow as it was categorized from safety issues to minor cosmetic details. Each item was well explained and then he spent all the time I needed talking me through each of them, answering my questions, helping me prioritize issues, and even discussing repair cost estimates. The result was that after serious negotiation backed by Jason’s report the seller met all of my requests. I highly recommend Jason and would hire him again in a heartbeat.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Jason Agre from Citrus Home Inspection completed the inspection on our home in the mountain town of Green Valley Lake. We were instructed to arrive an hour after the inspection started so it would be complete upon are arrival. Jason had completed the inspection when we arrived and gave us a thorough explanation of the issues and showed us all areas of concern. He was able to answer any and all questions we had reference the inspection. Our inspection report was competed before Jason left the property. Payment was quick and easy (and affordable), all done on line. I would definitely recommend Citrus Home Inspection if you are buying a house on the hill.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>Jason was amazing! My husband and I were looking for a home inspector close to home, while doing our research & reading reviews we seen nothing but great things said of Jason Agre at Citrus Home inspection. I'm so glad we made that call. He made everything  so easy to understand.  I also have two small dogs that were freaking out the entire time! But Jason talked to them & tried to calm them. That's something that meant alot. The fact that he took the time to give them attention was appreciated.  Thank you Jason! I will absolutely be recommending your services!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1567055619941, 'text': 'Thank you Claudia, your pups were so cute!

<Review>My experience with Jason of Cutrus home inspection was nothing short of great. Jason was very friendly and very knowledgeable of his job and what he is doing. Jason took the time to sit down and explain in detail of the inspection he performed. He was informative and was open to any and all questions and suggestions. He answered all of me and my wife's questions without hesitation and even elaborated more than just giving a short answer. I highly recommend and refer Citrus Hone inspection any faybof the week.<//Review>< Pictures>

I couldn’t have hoped for a better experience than I had with Jason Agre and Citrus Home Inspection. His fees were very reasonable, he adjusted his schedule around mine and he was very knowledgeable. Additionally, Jason’s use of current technology (drone and FLIR infrared camera) allowed him to find broken roof tiles and a leak stemming from the master bathroom. The house was previously on the market and had been inspected less than two weeks prior to Jason’s inspection and the leak was not found at that time. I wouldn’t hesitate to hire Jason again and I’ve already recommended him to a friend.<//Text>

I couldn't be more pleased with Jason Agre of Citrus Home Inspection. He was professional, friendly, knowledgeable about the area and the specific details that pertained to the home, detailed and patient. He gave us a thorough personal walk-through and description of the issues he found, and then that evening we received his incredibly thorough and well organized report. The website he uses makes the process clear and simple for the buyer to understand, share, and request for repairs/credits from the seller.

I would use Citrus Home Inspection again and again!</Review>

Jason does amazing work. He arrived very early and was already inspecting the roof prior to my arrival.  He is EXTREMELY thorough,  and answers all of my questions and concerns. He has the latest and greatest technology,  some of which consisting of a drone for aerial views of the roof which also takes crystal clear hd pictures, and a thermal imaging camera which he showed me can help identify hot/ cold  spots in the home. We had the inspection report that night,  and it's very easy to understand.  He is very reasonably priced,  especially considering the time and work he put into the inspection.  If you're looking for an  honest inspector who will get the job done right,  look no further!</Text>

<review>Such a great experience during a stressful process. Jason was so thorough during the inspection and was very patient with all of my questions. The process of buying a home is such a stressful thing in itself and knowing that the inspection was handle by someone so honest and detailed made it one less thing to worry about. Thank You Jason!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Been using Western Exterminator for many years now & have always been very happy with their service. Todd always communicates with me the day before he comes about his arrival time so that I can keep my dog inside, which I appreciate. He's always been professional & knowledgeable whenever I've had questions. Highly recommend!< /Review><UserId.>106219830459755932257< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We have used Western for our pest control service for years and have been fortunate to have Charlie as our service tech in Mission  Viejo for the last handful of years.  He is always on time, friendly,  and extremely professional. The care and concern he shows for our peppery as well as the employees is truly appreciated.  We would highly recommend Western for all your commercial and residential needs,  and hopefully you can be lucky enough to get Charlie as your technician.</Review>< pics>

Had horrible experience where an inspector that I was paying for talked to the prospective home buyers for my house and told them of extensive damage requiring the roof being torn off. Before a report was issued. And they tented my house in 2017 and did not see the damage at the time. So either the tenting was ineffective or the inspection at that time was not complete. And best of all, Western Management did not think the inspector did anything wrong talking directly to the perspective buyers. Evidently you specifically have to request that the inspector not divulge problems to your buyer before the report is even written. FYI

I've used Western in the past and liked them. But as they say you can tell the worth of a company by how they handle things gone wrong. So now the buyers have backed out and Western Santa Ana is being evasive about helping me out. They also make it very difficult to get to talk with management and its taken many phone calls to ferret names out. So transparency is an issue if you do have a problem. Complaining to the receptionist will only get you so far. I am very frustrated.</review>

<Review>Charlie at Western Exterminator has taken care of our house for many years.  He's on time and does an excellent job!  We used to get ants inside the house and after Charlie sprays the house, we don't have any issues with ants or any other pests for that matter for many months.

The price is very competitive and there are no hidden fees.  He doesn't push unnecessary service and is always a pleasure to work with!   I highly recommend Charlie and Western Exterminator.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I have used the services of Western Exterminator for many years, and I have always been grateful for the work that they do.  It is of such high quality that I would not even consider another exterminating company.  Some years ago, I established contracts for quarterly service, and while the quarterly inspections and treatments are always timely, I have been able to call at any time for service.  This company is simply outstanding.  While all of their technicians are excellent, I have to acknowledge especially Charlie Gray, who has responded to practically all of my service requests over the years.  I have always appreciated his careful attention to every situation that requires extermination at my home.  And whenever I have questions about the various invaders from insects to mice and rats, Charlie has proven to be a patient, comforting, and informative teacher.  I am glad that Western Exterminator has him on its technical staff.</Review>

<Time>1615222584378< /Time><review>I use Western Exterminator for monthly pest control services and have used them for over 10 years. My service professional, Frank, has been assigned to me for most of those years.  He is courteous, professional, hard working and always goes above and beyond my expectations. He calls me the day before service to let me know what time he will arrive and checks in to see if I have any new pest control issues. If he finds something new during his visit he always touches base with me and we discuss any additional services that might be needed. I also appreciate that he is very good with my two dogs and he always closes the gate behind him. Thank you Frank and Western Exterminators for hiring and retaining great employees.< /review>< Rating>

<review>Western Exterminator has been top notch from day one. They're very thorough in their reviews of house issues and helpful in coming out to get rid of your problems. I would highly recommend their services. I have a bi-monthly service to eradicate ants, spiders, and lessen the mosquito issues in the hot months. I also used them to plug holes in my garage and take care of a rodent problem. I would recommend Western Exterminator to anyone!< /review>< pictures>

We absolutely love our technician Rick Jasperson. He is extremely thorough he's always respectful and pleasant and he's an extremely hard worker. He's always very accommodating and responsive to any inquiries we may have whether it be a sneaky little mouse or a few extra ants. He always goes out of his way to make sure the problem is taken care of. I couldn't ask for a better Tech then Rick.</review>

Western Exterminator, through its Orange County pest control specialist, Charlie, has been servicing our home on a scheduled basis for over ten years. Charlie has provided great service, mostly preventive but occasionally focused on a specific challenge (Help Charlie, bees are forming a hive in our hose reel!).  There is no better service out there.....dependable, personable, professional.</Text>

< Review>
Western Exterminator assigned one of their technicians, Isaac, to our home about 6 years ago, after we called asking for help with bug and rodent problems with the old house we just purchased. Isaac brought his knowledge and expertise, as well as a great attitude to the problem. He was able to get the problems under control, and maintained our home safely for many years after. Recently, during an inspection for a real estate transaction, a hidden nest of cockroaches was discovered in our attic. We had no idea, since there was no evidence of their existence in the living areas. Isaac brought his knowledge and expertise to this new problem, and over the course of 3 days, managed to exterminate the entire nest - bravo!! We have come to depend on Western Exterminator to maintain our home with this kind of excellent response.< /Review>

Since Western Exterminator was bought out five or six years ago, the family business atmosphere faded with it. Recently they have been very aggressive with their billing, such as sending out delinquent notices when the bill has been long paid. I find it very rude and it reeks of much greed. I am busy enough with my life and too busy to check and see if I already paid a bill that I am most certain I already paid. It makes me feel as if my mind is not as crisp as before and it is a waste of my time which is also valuable.  They have also had an enormous turnover of service technicians too, which shows that they don't treat their employees well. In addition, when I complained to management a few years back about my technician neglecting part of the standard service I pay for, his supervisor actually had the gall to tell me that my previous technicians were just going out of their way when they performed that particular service in the past, which is a blatant lie, because the cobweb tool is always on their trucks and they have always taken it out and removed cobwebs for years without me saying one word. This shows that the problem goes further than the bottom and all the way up to management. When management sticks up for a lazy employee, that is never a good sign!<//Text>

Rosie is always here when expected to perform our service. In the rare event that we have a pest sighting, she takes care of it right away and we have no more issues.
She also has helped explain other services that we've used (e.g. sanitizing the building) so we know what to expect.</Review>

I have been using Western Exterminator for about 10 years.   Todd is the rep that comes to the house each time.   He is polite, knowledgeable, and personable.    As a homeowner I appreciate the consistency of the same rep coming to our house.  Rarely over the years have I had to call because of seeing insects outside of our service but Todd makes it a priority to take care of any unwanted pests.   I appreciate the service, the dependability and Todd who makes it all the better to work with an exterminating company.<//Text>

Over these past 30 years he has been the most professional, caring, understanding, compassionate, and on time service person we have ever dealt with. He has helped me clean out my pantry while hunting for pantry moths. He has always taken special care of our koi pond, because he has one, and knows the danger of chemicals around them. He is accommodating when we are on vacation and changes his schedule accordingly. I just can't say enough about the man except that his professional attitude is outstanding and, therefore,  he has also become a friend.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Isaac is the best! He's been our exterminator for over 5 years. He's helped to keep our tree rats at bay and recently helped with a surprise cockroach infestation in the attic. Really went above and beyond with that one!
If we have a problem, he comes right out to help. We're moving and we'll miss him!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Todd, our technician is clean, personable, on time and thorough.  He always asks if there is anything else we want looked at.  When called out unexpectedly for an issue that has arisen he is always courteous in response and then schedules a time that is convenient for both of us.  I believe he is an asset to your firm.

<text>We called them Friday, for a one time service, for mosquitoes. We made arrangements for them to come Monday 8-10. 8 am door bell rings. A very nice young man, with his mask on, proceeded to check our entire property, telling us what he was doing. I wish I would have noticed when he left. Anyway, he explained that we didn’t have mosquitoes on our property and left without charging us a penny. How surprising, I don’t think it’s ever happened before. Anytime I have a problem, I will call them.

We have been customers of Western Exterminator for over 20 years. For most of these years, Todd Gregory has been our service technician. He responds quickly and takes care of our property expertly. We’ve really depended on him when we’ve had surprise issues, and he never disappoints! Thanks Todd and Western Exterminators.< /Text>

Kyle was very helpful in getting me in touch with a scheduler for my termite inspection. I was set up with a free inspection by James. James was on time, used good Covid practices and was very through in explaining what he found. He gave me a good price and is working to get my work scheduled on an expedited basis. I was impressed with his knowledge and professionalism.< /text>

We use this service bi-monthly. It is an effective and great service. Jacinto is a fantastic technician who always calls ahead to let us know he’s coming and checks in before and after service to find out if there are additional issues that need to be addressed. I would highly recommend Western Exterminators for all your pest control needs with a tech like Jacinto!<//Review>

We've been using W.E. for many years at both commercial & residential locations. Charlie is also very responsive if ever needed between our monthly service dates. We don't ever have to worry about insects, bugs, etc inside or even near the outsides of the structures.</text>

<review>I’ve been working with Charlie for almost 4 years and I’ve never met someone that provides these services that I can call to help me discard a rodent in the backyard and show up so fast to discard it and clean the area do my kids can play again or be so flexible with my time or do work around the house or office on his day off. Thank you Charlie.< /review><user_id>112277548852538793843< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

We did have one incident recently where we saw what looked like possible termite dropping. Patrick came out and did a home inspection.  He was super nice and set up a local attic spray appt. for us.
Everyone is so nice and I feel like Western is a good company. Their prices seems very reasonable. We have used them for about 20 years.<//review><time>1569986623981<//time>< username>

Expect the bare minimum to be completed. We had our technician change and I brought up that we needed bait stations at all exterior dock bay doors. His response was that he knew this needed to be done but since the previous technician didn't set them up that we were fine with it. It should be the technicians job to recommend and fix anything that he does not see is correct. To not know and let it go would have been understandable but to know and tell me you know is not the way to meet customer satisfaction.< /Review>

< review>
Over the years Western Exterminator has been extremely reliable and service oriented. Our technician, Isaac, is very conscientious and his attention to detail is second to none. The best thing is that we are pest free! The other day I sent over a picture of some dead bugs to Isaac that I discovered outside our home and was relieved to learn that even though they looked menacing they were harmless June bugs.</review>

Issac does a great job every month.  He always calls or texts the night before to let us know when he will be at the house.  And is always willing to make an extra house call when needed.< /Text>

They come every other month and spray the perimeter of my yard, dust under the eaves, etc.  They call in advance so I never miss a treatment. It's wonderful not having to worry about ants, etc. NOTHING!! Very courteous!</review>

The primary reason for our satisfaction with Western Exterminator is our service technician, Ernie.  Although we moved from our home of 15-years to a new home three years ago, Ernie was able to continue to be our technician. He is responsive, does a throrough job, and always considerate of any unique needs that arise.<//Review>

<Text>I would not give a star if I had that choice.
I have sent multiple responses back about Western Exterminator service and billing issues and I have never received a response. Their billing system is awful. You never know what is being billed and for what period of time. But you will always know what is owed. They do not bill on regular cycles. My December 2018 and January 2019 bills came within a week of each other. Confusing to say the least.
Our technician is a nice man but comes at odd times. We have an ant infestation and he came to our house just before it was dark. I told him about the problem and he noted our service report as “no pests found.” Tough to pay $50 per month for service like that.
Now that I have cancelled our service because I think I can do a better diy job than Western Exterminator, the Operations Manager has called me several times to see what can be done to keep us with Western Exterminator. The damage had already been done.
It boils down to a concept of “worth what paid for.” I could not justify paying $50 a month for their lack of service and billing support. While I will keep Western Exterminator’s termite service, there is no way I would ever consider Western Exterminator for pest control services. There must be far better pest control providers or doing the work yourself than what we experienced with Western Exterminator.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Tenting was done well.  Service for our subterranean traps  is abysmal.  Minimal coordination of service visits.  One visit the traps were not even opened just.  The last visit traps were left open and never closed.  Still waiting for the tech to return.<//text>

The service is very professional and great.  They always find a way to work around my wife's and my schedule to ensure someone is around to put the dog away when they come out.  My service technician tells me what is being sprayed, how long I need to keep my pets inside, and if I every have a weird bug infestation somewhere in the house he perks up and asks to for detail to ensure the problem is eradicated.  Since I started my service my flea problem disappeared, cockroaches, which are everywhere in Fullerton, aren't at my house, and black widows which used to be everywhere have all but disappeared.  He also stays away from my garden which is organic and pesticide free, but he makes a cool perimeter around it so things can't go from my garden into my house.  The cost is reasonable, but I will be honest that there are other exterminators that have offered me slightly better rates, however, I'm sticking with Western Exterminator.  You get what you pay for, and for me the proof of their excellence has been my bug free existence.< /text>

<user_name>Eileen DeBrita< /user_name><Text>As a LONG time customer,  almost 30 years now, and have been VERY happy with the services that Western performs!  Sabas has been our technician, for many years now, and we could not be happier with his professionalism, yet very friendly and kind, calls to confirm our appointment, and then still calls when he's on his way!  If EVER I encounter any insect that wriggles, flies or just a pest from the neighbor's pets, Western immediately, within 24 hours, has tech Sabas at my door; and no questions asked, or any additional charges to my quarterly service fees. I would highly recommend Western Exterminators!  And I believe I've only had 2, maybe 3, technicians, in all these years, as they are very loyal, and they better be treated right, or so I've been told by a manager. Hopefully, this will get to the "powers-at-be", to recognize their employees, as they are the face of the company, that the world sees!!!  Again, thank you Sabas!!!!<//Text><Response>None< /Response><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been a satisfied customer for over 40 years. Western has rescued me from ants, rodents and wasps, sometimes on weekends. My serviceman is great and there is little turnover in staffing. I highly recommend Western.<//Text>

David is very nice. The ants this year are extremely bad.  living in a townhouse our walls are right next to neighbors, if they don't spray it is  more of a challange. But so far he has come back once and he said he would again if we need.  Before our next scheduled spray.< /Review>

Haven't had any bugs in the house or rodents since using Western Exterminator Company for over 2 years now.  Danny Lozano is the best!  He knocks down any outside webs, and sprays under the patio furniture per my request.  He's very polite and very professional and does a great job!<//review>

<review>Operators that answer the calls are super nice. I have no doubt that they pass on the message for service, its getting the tech to respind that seens to be the problem. Plan on calling at LEAST 3-4 times before someone will show up and that is if they dont cancel in u at the last minute.<//review>< Pics>

Highly recommend always holding out for that.<//Text>< pictures>

<date>1620777561118< /date><text>This place was a wonderful experience for my family of 5. 4 generations went to this restaurant to celebrate Mother's Day. What a fantastic decision this turned out to be.  The restaurant  was elegantly appointed.  The servers were quick and friendly.  The food was delicious! This was my first time ever attending this restaurant and I will go back again.!!!! I was pleasantly surprised.  My only regret was the amount of wasted food generated by our family.  I just wish there was another way to taste everything with smaller portion sizes.  Anyway, it's a great place for dinner! Go on an empty stomach! Thank you for a beautiful dining experience for my family and me.< /text>< rating>

<review>Great ambiance and amazing food. Only downfall was that the meal and experience felt rushed.  They sat the 2 of Us at a 4 top table and we must have been asked if we were done "will that be all for you" 5 times.  No time to relax and enjoy the meal.  Grant it We didn't order wine and drinks (we were just in for dinner while working) so hopefully that wasn't the spark that we felt was being placed under our bottoms to expedite our departure.  Needless to say... I would definitely go back.  It's worth it.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x8085072c051576f1:0xef004a4a10bf4322</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The smiles says it all.  Meat for days.  Well worth it.  Staff is very attentive.  Salad bar is superb with hot soup.  Will visit again.</Text>

Ive been here four times and the food always taste the great!, this time i dined in for two persons and  they would not pay attention to you if they are busy. They mostly served the tables who have a large group. Overall the food was great! but 62$ per person was not very satisfying. I was not able to enjoy the meats because i lost we lost our appetite when we waited that long for the meats. I recommend to go here on weekdays so that they wont be that busy and would be able to serve tables better.< /Review>

All the food was top quality and offered a variety of flavors.  Servers were happy to bring specific requests for meat and temperature.</text>< pictures>

You'll leave there stuffed lol. The service is exceptional, you never have a problem getting what you need. Everyone is literally so nice, they make you feel so welcomed. Everytime we leave at least 6 people tell us thank you for coming, all the way to the door. It's nice. It's a great place, and an awesome experience no doubt. 5 stars for sure</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Really good food. The whole experience is great there . The salad bar is really fresh with a lot options . The meats are great you can get them from rare to well done just tell the Guachos. Everyone is super super nice . The meats is unlimited so eat as much as you want definitely recommend this place , a little pricey but well worth it.< /Text>

We had a reservation for 8:30 and we had to wait for 10min which was no big deal since we could see they had a birthday party that was leaving and they had to move some tables. It was mine and my fiancés first time and they were so nice and helpful. It was very busy so going to the salad bar  was a little hectic. I would've preferred they just brought me a salad. Besides that, the wine selection and wine wall décor was awesome. The meat just never stopped coming. The bacon wrapped filet mignon was my absolute favorite. The bottom sirloin was our second favorite! We would definitely go again! preferably on a less busy night.< /text>

< Review>
Had an amazing night, was greeted at least four times just on the way to our table. Their process is a little different from normal restaurants so we were patiently taught how they work and before we knew it, we were being offered selections from vegetables to salads to filet mignon to lamb to chicken to so many different varieties you couldn't imagine. It's almost literally a reverse buffet, and then to top it all off the tres leche cake was oh my God so gloriously delicious. Reasonable price for all you can eat filet mignon, I swear, they were offering us helpings so fast that before we could stop or knew what was happening we were so stuffed we could hardly breathe. Would recommend a hundred times over, exceptional service, food and prices.< /Review>

An excellent all you can eat steakhouse. The place is big with very nice ambiance. The service is EXCELLENT. Really. The food is very good and it keeps on coming. There is a great selection of meet, shrimp, grilled pineapple, fried bananas and much more. There is a great selection of wines, also by the glass. This place is tasty and also make you feel pampered and special. Highly recommended.<//Text>

One of the best dining experiences while visiting Napa.  Staff felt as if you were a part of their family and made sure you never had an empty plate unless asked for it. Cuisine was extremely flavorful and well prepared. Highly recommend!!</Text>

<Review>Wow! Great place for a extremely filling meal. I’ve been to quite a few Brazilian steakhouses and this one is the new king in my opinion. The seasoning was on point, the meat was super tender, and the staff was super friendly and accommodating. What more can you ask for?

Don’t be scared off by the price point of this meal, it is well worth it. You really do get so much for your money, but make sure you are hungry, and I mean hungry, before you go there.<//Review>< Pictures>

<user_name>emily lopez<//user_name><Text>our friends told us to try this place for my birthday and it was the best experience ever!!! they had so many options to choose from for the meats and you get to try ALL of them. the servers bring it table side on these huge skewers. the salad bar was good too. if you go you should definitely save room for dessert! our waitress jenifer surprised me with a brazilian flan because i said i never tried one before. she was so sweet and took care of us very well! the managers are also very kind and stopped by to see how we were doing and to ask if we had any requests for the meat. a little pricey but worth it. 10/10 my husband and i are definitely coming back for date night!< /Text>< Time>

Cannot turn anything down! That being said, you can slow down and wait for the second round of meat so do not panic! Def. try grilled cheese with spicy honey with grilled pineapple! Trying to keep your social distance from the salad bar and from the people around the bar is little difficult, you need to adapt a bit. We loved all the meat we had, just thinking lamb chops could be better.</text>

<review>Fantastic place to eat an authentic Brazilian all you can eat barbecue and salad bar. There are countless cuts of meat from beef, pork, chicken, lamb, salmon. If you plan to go here, come starving so you can have the best out of it. The salad bar is full of different types of cheese, vegetables, sauces, and some deli and sushi. It is definitely worth the money for celebrations and special dates.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODhLKWf3Ur0NUcUBXOmKSxRCKQNtbDx6zW-Ztx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

<review>Not a place to go on a date if you're into conversation. This is not a negative reflection on the wait staff, just the set up.

Maybe when COVID is ever a thing of the past, Salad Bars will be available...but besides the constant meat offerings; items usually self serve are now offered individually.< /review>< UserId.>

<rating>3</rating><Review>I would start to say that the food was unbelievably good. But I had to deal with “white rich people” Ik that sounds bad but listen to me. I was just enjoying my food and I just hearing 4 old white people just talking really negative towards us because I’m from “Alaska” and they judge me for eating a lot of meat. If you plan to go to this restaurant watch out for negative people like that also dress formal because they’ll judge you for that too and that’s what they’ve done.< /Review>< Pics>

The selection of meats and the endless variety of meat and all you can eat salad bar with tremendous sides is the perfect way to celebrate a event.

The food was nice. The meat came often, but did wait for a beef tenderloin for 1 h and 20 min to come around. Probably a bit overpriced, but overall atmosphere was nice.<//Review>

I've been to several Brazilian Steak houses.. this one was by far the worst.

During covid, the salad bar isn't open for self-serve which makes sense, but then there is no one coming around with salad bar choices even though it's still offered on the menu... so if you dont want to eat meat you basically don't eat. We had 3 people in our group do the salad bar option, so this was terrible for them. Then, at the end of the meal, the staff claimed those people ate meat from other people's plates, which they did not, they dont eat meat, they only came to a Brazilian steak house to support the birthday we were attending. The restaurant tried to charge them over $60.00 each when all they ate was maybe 3 pieces of asparagus and a piece  of lettuce... it was an extremely uncomfortable experience. The entire time it felt like a trap and money hustling scheme.

The meat was fine, nothing to write home about when compared to other Brazilian steak houses.

Will not be recommending to friends who visit the area.< /Text>

< Review>
Wow!  I must start by saying I am NOT much of a meat person....opted for the amazing salad bar.
WELL worth it!
My husband and son had the full meat course.  Loved it!
The food was incredible!
Cocktails were perfect!(I had the mojito).
Most amazing was the service!
My son dropped his fork and before he had time to reclaim it, a lovely gentlemen brought him a replacement.  Our waters were never below half full....

I have never witnessed such impeccable service.  Ever.  From our waiter to the gentlemen bringing the meat....This place has definitely invested and fully executed a true customer service experience.  I have worked in the hospitality industry all my life and have NEVER experienced such service!
Props to the owners, managers, for the dedication to expectations.  To the entire team that assisted us(must have been at least 8 individuals working with our table throughout the evening)were lovely human beings!
I WILL be back!
My only fear is they have set the bar too high...not sure I won't compare our service moving forward to this amazing place
Kudos to a wonderful group of people!<//Review>

Galpao is carnivore heaven! The parmesan pork loin, lamb chops and the succulent, tender beef ribs are the best in the building. Grilled pineapple was a warm sweet palate cleaner. Shrimp,  sirloin,  filet mignon, salmon...If you love meat and want to dine in a restaurant where they keep it coming until you cry uncle,  this is for you!</review>

In town last week for work and we had a group dinner at Galapao.  The food and service were great.  The salad bar was filled with many tasty and healthy options.  Of course, the meats were wonderful.
Looking forward to heading back soon.</Review>

<text>Uncommon place with Brazilian all you can eat service during Covid times. The self-service buffet is closed, but they offer options in the table. The meat was very good. The prices are ok for lunch during the week $39 against $63 for dinner and weekends. There are Brazilian drinks like caipirinha.< /text>< GmapID>

Great meat selection, great service, restaurant manager Brito was amazing.  Not enough seafood  no scallops ☹️but it was still great. If they charge dinner prices for Sunday lunch they should provide all meat and seafood.</review>

I don't give many 5-Star reviews. This place was amazing. Very good food. Incredible service. Big variety. Excellent cocktails served very quickly. Dessert was excellent. Nice atmosphere. Not a single complaint. A bit expensive once you add cocktails and dessert but the service and quality are worthy. Highly recommended.<//review>

Service is exceptional. It was our first time visiting and we were blown away. They had a large salad bar with so many options to choose from. Once you get to your table, the food won't stop coming. The Caipirinha's were also delicious. Highly recommended you visit.</review>

<text>Absolutely lovely experience! The food, the service, the setting were all first rate. The servers and young men cutting the meat tableside were courteous and solicitous, but what really impressed was the industrious, thorough, quick and cheerful young woman filling and tidying the salad bar. She worked hard, she worked swiftly, she was amazing. Five stars for a wonderful experience all-around.</text>< Name>

<review>In this day and age there are a tremendous amount of options for one to dine at. I have barely tried all of the world's cuisine, but I intend to one bite at a time. A Brazilian steakhouse happens to be one of them!

On A Saturday evening we had reservations for 6:00 pm.  By then the parking lot was completely full and we had to use Napa Winery Inn's lot next door. No big deal. We were politely greeted and waited a few minutes before being seated.

For attire you can get away with everyday wear. Not everyone followed this, but to my surprise there were a lot of guests dressed casually. I felt a little overdressed from everyone. Nonetheless a lot of the staff had smiles no matter who they were serving.

Our waitress Tahis for the evening was just wonderful from beginning to end. Maybe I just haven't been to many restaurants with excellent service. It was the little things she did on her own like asking if we wanted fresh mashed potatoes or bananas throughout our meal. Without asking she gave us new plates instead of using the same one. Her demeanor was genuinely hospitable and very attentive. She alone gets five stars!

Buffet ($59.95)-

They do have a gourmet salad bar that had a variety of items including; vegetables, cured meats, cheeses, sushi, deviled eggs, bacon, and more. There were also a few selections of hot soups. We were also given cheese bread and mashed potatoes at our table.  I will admit, nothing was really memorable compared to the meats we had. Although, I would like to try the soups next time though.

From a handful of mixed reviews I was hesitant to how our experience would be with the all you can eat meats. On a whole we happily devoured each delicious mouthful of seasoned well meat. The bottom sirloin steak was the only tidbit that I thought was unpleasantly overcooked. Sidenote, the simple caramelized bananas went perfect with the meat. The sweet and savory hit the spot!

For the amount you pay per person it is expensive and probably not the best place to bring children unless they really have an appetite. I would suggest eating your money's worth before calling it quits! Our lovely dining experience was exactly what we needed to celebrate our 11 year anniversary. My Love is already set on having our anniversary dinner there again!< /review>< pics>

<Text>I think I will have to try them a second time before I can fully decide if they deserve a 5 stars. I think the service was average could have been better. It a little slower when they got busy.

The food is good, but if they could please give a different color chip to turn over when you only eat chicken or fish. It was so annoying having 8 waiters bring pork  Steaks,  and a number of different meats and you constantly repeat no I would like salmon or chicken. Then they don't bring it for maybe 20 minutes.  The wait and lack of true service if your not eating red meat is miserable and you still pay the same thing receive 70% less service and probably 50% less food.. not good.
If you fix this one point you would be worthy of the price and more stars</Review>

<review>Get ready for this! Have enough hunger:) it's fixed price per person with all you can eat brazilian meat delicasies of 17 different types of grilled meat. My favorite was the special sirloin. And also has at least a hundred different Napa wines to go with it. Very good staff, excellent service.< /review>< pics>

One of the best restaurants ever! Great atmosphere and the service was excellent. Unbelievable salad bar with cheese and smoked salmon.  The meat is the star here, and there's more than you could imagine. I was particularly impressed with the lamb, and the bacon wrapped fillets!<//Review>

We made a reservation 2 weeks ago and when we got there we were told to wait in line-outside- together with all the other people that had also made reservations.  We waited for over 1 hour to be seated. Waiters and manager RUNNING all over the place, I'm not exaggerating,  they were all running! My waiter couldn't give us much attention (I don't blame him). I'm Brazilian and it was my first time there. I expected more.<//text>< GmapID>

We showed up at opening time at 3pm on a Saturday and didn't have to wait to be seated. We were treated very well, excellent service and friendly staff! As for the food, everything was delicious. Everything at the bar was fresh, and the Brazillian steaks were so good. Their house special sirloin steak was to die for!</review>

Wow. What a wonderful selection of meat did they serve us. I was a bit tearful because I didn’t have room for lamb chops. There is a buffet of cheese, cured meats and salads but as soon as they see your card flipped on the green side they hover around you with different cuts of meat. Everything from salmon to lamb was served and I tried my best to feast on half of the animal kingdom. A bit pricey if you go as a group but definitely worth it to take the one you love.<//Review>

<review>This place was easy to find and absolutely gorgeous inside! I came with my best friend to celebrate her birthday, which I mentioned in the reservation, and they were great about it! They bring a ton of varieties of meat on giant skewers, and if you want it, They plop it right on your plate! They kept our water refilled, rolls (heavenly and gluten free) stocked up, and they asked if we were looking forward to anything in particular. Then they brought out whatever it was we wanted! Delicious food, super attentive staff, and at the end, when we ordered creme brulee, it came with a birthday greeting on the plate! My friend was super surprised! The dessert was delicious too! If you are celebrating anything, maybe on a date, or just for any reason, I highly recommend it! They just opened up a Walnut Creek location as well! Give them a try, I guarantee you will walk in and roll out!<//review>< user_id>

The best way to put it is that their price is very steep and I still can't complain. I wouldn't go there every day because I would go broke, but when I want my wife to know she's worth it this place passes with flying colors. It's particularly special for steak lovers (my wife) but I can't get enough of their sausage and lamb. I'm not a steak lover but they still definitely make close to or possibly the best steak I've ever had and my wife agrees. I don't mind paying their steep price on occasion because when it's this good I want to be a part of making sure it doesn't go away. Tip: if you show up here, show up hungry--it's all you can eat and it's so good I often regret not being hungrier.< /Text>

< Review>
We had our mother's day lunch/dinner here and it was well worth the price. The servers have been really helpful on how to go on with getting our fill and the gauchos that served the food have been quick to response. There is about 17 types of Brazilian BBQ that you can pick from and we only went through about 6 or 7. Their lamb chops are great, the flavor or the rosemary combined well with the flavor of the meat. The pork was tender and juicy not dry at all, and the flavor of spices that were used enchances the flavor of the pork just right and their beef was just how I like it (medium to medium rare). I liked how the beef was seasoned just right and how there are some charred parts that made me crave for more. The dessert complimented the BBQ by toning down the experience to end the meal perfectly. My wife, my sister, my daughter and I enjoyed it very much. Next time we will bring our appetite and I may be able to go through all 17 choices in their menu. Thank you for the experience.< /Review>

<text>The noise was overwhelming!
We were seated in an area with other groups of diners, but their noisy conversations were so loud we couldn't hear our own conversation!
The salad bar was nice, the offers of beef were good but overall $200 was a lot to pay for a ruined dinner. Sad.< /text>< user_name>

<text>Truly a unique experience with great ALL U CAN EAT MEAT! Lots of fun!
Local tip-
Go sit at the bar, have drinks and order the steak appetizer, Brazilian mash potatoes and salad. .  I'm pretty confident you and your date will be suffonsified for a fraction of the cost.<//text>< time>

<review>Wow, that's all I can say. 17 different types of meat and a fantastic salad bar. Don't fill up on the salad bar because when the meats start coming around you will get full fast.<//review>< UserId.>

Excellent Atmosphere...Excellent Food.

One Issue...We visited for a 2pm lunch on a Sunday.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all, but we constantly felt rushed. We drove 2 hours from northern Lake County to visit this restaurant and the whole visit was done in 38 minutes.  When you spend $200 for a meal, you expect to enjoy it and not feel rushed.  There was a constant flow of staff coming to the table to offer food, replace plates, fill water glasses, etc. etc. regardless of our little table cards flipped to the red side. I think its fair to say that 5 minutes never passed without someone visiting the table.

If we make it back to the restaurant, we hope to not feel so rushed.< /Text>

Staff are extremely attentive and treat you like royalty.  Food is really good, with some meat selections (i.e. beef ribs) being you've-got-to-be-kidding-me good.  Ambiance is great: filled wine high-end wine, beautiful and cozy....not at all like other "dining hall" steakhouses.  It's great to see they are expanding locations so others can share in this amazing experience.</Review><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

My friends and I celebrated my birthday at Galpao Gaucho. We were served by the most excellent staff. We felt as if we were the only customers, and all of our special needs were met with smiles. A wonderful and delicious dining experience. I can't wait to return!</Text>

<text>What a great experience!  Very unique and fun.  All of the reviews have covered the basics.  Don't fill up on the salad bar - start enjoying steak as soon as you can and most of all, be adventurous!  The service was excellent!  They create such a fun atmosphere which we truly appreciated.  Yes, this place is expensive, so probably not the right place for light eaters or children.. You will overpay for them.. But for us meat lovers.. its wonderful!  I would like to be back and have more of a Brazilian experience.  It would be nice if they had the traditional seasoning and more Brazilian side dishes over and above rice and beans. .</text>< resp>

<Review>Amazing Food!!! My husband brought me here for my birthday. I had never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before. The bacon wrapped chicken and bacon wrapped filet mignon was wonderful! They have a great salad bar. The staff is attentive and the meats keep coming. I also was given a choice of complementary dessert for my birthday and selected the lava cake....so worth it! We will definitely be back for a future special occasion.</Review><name>amy bragg<//name><UserId.>103365449560074888786</UserId.><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1574477907347< /Time><rate>5<//rate>< GmapID>

<Review>Not great. Either our meat was undercooked or over seasoned. I had a slice of beef that was so salty, I almost spit it out. The shrimp should’ve been cooked through but instead, when you bit into it, it was almost mushy. Save your $62 dollars and go to a regular restaurant. This place is not worth the $$$.</Review><time>1579411122113</time><gmap_id>0x8085072c051576f1:0xef004a4a10bf4322< /gmap_id><name>Jennica Schofield<//name>< resp>

<review>I dare you to try to finish your glass of water here before someone refills it. You can't. They have water ninjas here that make sure of that. I don't know how they do it.
Food is good too. Not sure I'd pay $65 for it again.

But seriously, those water ninjas are something else.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>My first Brazilian Steakhouse experience and it was amazing. The food is impeccable,  "salad bar" is an understated way to refer to the amazing spread of salads, soups, veggies, cheeses and other amazing items you can get. Salad bar was kept perfectly clean with staff constantly attending it to ensure no messes and everything well-stocked. This is definitely NOT your Souplantation salad bar. The service was perfect - staff friendly, helpful and accommodating. And then there is the meat...just...WOW! I finished off my meal with a carajillo- great presentation!

A real experience  in dining out.  It is ($60. each)  but if you can afford it please try it.  A LARGE salad bar with everything.  Then Waiters come by with skewered meat offers of every kind and  they keep coming until you tell them you've  had enough.  All you can eat. Excellent  service.<//review>

All you can eat buffet of barbeque, with an excellent antipasto and salad bar. Not a good choice for those who are vegan, vegetarian or not meat eaters. If you like ribs, premium cuts of steak, or large garlic prawns, this is the place to satisfy your carving. The drinks aren't anything special, but they're good.</review>

We felt supremely catered to...service is over the top! The meat is seasoned perfectly and served to your preferred temp. Don't eat meat? There's something for all appetites; even the vegan dare I say. Perfect for date night, boys night, girls night and family time.< /Text>

<Review>Wonderful service and delicious food! I always prefer my red meat rare which isn’t necessarily possible here because of the way it is served, but it was still incredibly flavorful and when I mentioned I preferred lamb chops rare, they brought the next batch to us first and it was about as close as you can get. The strip steak and tri tip are juicy and delicious! Don’t fill up on the salad bar and save room for meat! Buuuuttt that’s hard to do because their salad bar is also very nice and not your usual salad bar. The decor is lovely and the wait staff is attentive. They were funny and friendly and if I was local, I’d go back again and again! So when I visit Napa in the future, I’ll be back!<//Review><Name>Sarah Morehead<//Name>< UserId.>

There was no difference is the service or food quality if it was only two of us there.  The staff is beyond wonderful!!!  Easy a light meal the night prior and light snacks the day you go.

Great place if you love meat .. or not! They have a pretty good selection of salads, cured meats, soups, cheeses and veggies. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Great place for lunch also cheaper and you can have the same experience but during the day. It's a must go!</Review>

We just had lunch at this great restaurant! Reservations was made for 1pm, but we were faking behind time due to the winery visits but Galpão Gaucho accommodated us! Phew..

Food was excellent! A big salad bar and 17 different types of meat. All cooked to a very high standard. Above average prices for lunch, but well worth it due to the high quality of food.</review>

Great food, great atmosphere, amazing customer service. This place has that and so much more. I was easily able to reserve my table using the "open table app, when i checked in, they knew who I was and immediately led me to my seating, all with smiles along the way. Throughout the dining experience, staff was around to see if there was anything else I needed, they were attentive and quick to respond. Definitely coming back.</Review>

<review>While vacationing in Napa, we were looking for a nice dinner to celebrate our anniversary. We love gaucho style restaurants so we decided to give this a try. What a wonderful find!
Friendly, respectful staff.
Comfy atmosphere.
The food...De.li.cious!  So many choices at the salad bar. Nice cuts of meat, very flavorful. (The salmon was a little bigger piece than necessary for this style of reataurant but soooo good!) Of course, we topped it all off with the chocolate molten cake. Not too rich, certainly not lacking in flavor.
Thank you for making this anniversary memorable.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRKhYW3EWS1ZwZD5NRpsrM2C_lXK6Uol3f6KvG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

I finally stopped by Galpao during my last visit to Napa (not sure why took me so long to do so!). The restaurant hosts a large food bar that includes salmon, a wide variety of cuts of perfectly spiced and grilled filet mignon, ribeye, lamb, pork, chicken, salmon and more, all carved tableside.

Also, imported cheeses, along with everything else you could possibly want, and don’t forget the full salad bar. With over 40 items offered, there is no shortage of food. If you enjoy steakhouses, then a trip to Galpao Gaucho in Napa is a must. The food is excellent, and the customer service is extraordinary.

We had a great meal, definitely going back next time we are in Napa</Text>

Decent and SOOOO expensive .. the service was ok... like decent .. they served the meat WAYYY to fast . They want you in and out fast .. they rush you .. the meat flavors were good ,out of 5 of us 4 our stomachs bloated right away, Almost like they put something in the meat to mess your stomach up so you don’t eat alot. They are sneaky on your bill to.  they will try to get away with a bunch of extra charges .. they charged for 2 extra people and drinks, it’s really crazy .. my brother said they always do this when he goes but they always fix the bill iIFFFF you catch it .. it was mom AND dads birthday this time and they promised a free dessert for each of them .. they brought out 1 ONE creme brûlée with 2 candles and 2 spoons and put it in between them ! REALLY!!’!?!? I WILL NEVER GO back .. the bill was $500.. and SOOOO NOT WORTH IT.

P.S. triple check your bill< /text>

The service here is worth more than the cost of your meal. The sides and soups are amazing and the selection of meats is fabulous. The flavors are VERY good as well. There just aren't enough words honestly.. I will be coming back!</Review>

Superb dining with delicious food. High quality gourmet dishes including cheese, Italian deli meats, olives,  Vegas, and slow roasted meats that are mouth watering.  The grilled pineapple is from Heaven. Outstanding service and exquisite decor.  All nestled in the heart of Napa. Lounge area is awesome and energetic.<//text>

Excellent place to go, if you have the money. Table for 7 ran almost $600. If you do have the money dont hesitate to try it out, as a matter of fact i demand you go and have a great feast there.<//Review>

Expensive but well worth it!
The entire experience and how professional the service is was beyond imagine. We had a hard time finishing our water and drinks cause they were Soo prompt with their service.
You get a small card that lays on the table and you flip it to is green side and prepare for the onslaught of delicious cuts of beef.
This is how great the service is.
They checked my Girl friends ID card to make sure she was of age to consume alcohol.
And when we asked for our check they have us a molten lava cake and some well wishes.
Not once did we mention it was her birthday.
I work in customer service and I would have never thought about something like that.
A+ service.
There's a reason why this place is well known.
The over all experience was well worth the price and I will be coming here for every special occasion< /Review>

Thank you to the crew at Galpao for an amazing night. The level of service we received was unbelievable. At every turn, the staff was one step ahead of us in tending to our needs. Whenever I thought that things couldn't get any better, there they were again, showing us just how attentive they were. It was my wedding anniversary and they surprised us with a creme brulee. It was a small but very meaningful gesture for us. I  would absolutely dine here again and recommend Galpao to anybody else. Cheers to the staff at Galpao who make it possible!<//text>

<review>If you absolutely love meat then this is the place to go! Came here on a Friday night - All of the meat that was served was delicious to the last bite! The steak was like butter when cut. Didn't struggle with the knife at all. They come around with different types of meat,17 different types of meat. (rib eye, sirloin, prime rib, and MORE) ask how would you like your meat and they cut the perfect piece for you. Every bite had the right seasoning, char, fat and juiciness. I enjoyed this experience with a group of friends who all thought the same thing.

Dessert - I had a strawberry creme and my bf had the molten cake. Both were scrumptious and I didn't know which one I liked better. How about ordering BOTH again, just to finalize my decision.

The salad bar had an immense selection of cheese! There was smoked salmon, fresh veggies, salami, sushi, bread and so much more than I was to excited to remember everything there.

The inside has a fine romantic dining ambiance feel which made it more enjoyable. Location of the restaurant is really easy to get too, right off the highway! I normally am one to take photos of my food and where I am and post it on every social media I have but I was so impressed by this place that I didn't even want to ruin the setting of how beautiful it was.

I am going to have to take my mom here and the rest of my family to experience this amazing place.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

A meat lover's dream come true!
The smell captivates you when you walk in. The staff was friendly and service was excellent. I enjoyed more meat in one outing then I have in years. Great place, great atmosphere, good time all around.</review>

Good steak n meats. Good side dishes and a pretty good salad bar, good solid options but nothing crazy. Also some authentic Brazilians working there, fun sharing culture and laughs. A little pricey for what you get, unless your starving and can eat forever.< /Review>

<review>Great selection of food. Impeccable staff!
You sit down for drinks, then to a salad bar (not much salad, mostly cheeses, deli meat, sun dried tomatoes, olive dishes, sushi, veggie dishes, and 2 bowls of salad).
Upon arrival to your table, you are greated with an onslaught of various meat (chicken pork, salmon, and lamb). You may pass or accept any meat (rare, medium or done, and in between). There's a red and green card to let them know if you want more meat or if you are enjoying the food and don't want another slice at that time. There's one server for a table with 3-4 others serving the meat. It is a we'll trained and choreographed meal.
Once done with the main course, there's dessert too.
Overall great experience, clean restaurant, and gregarious staff.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rating>5< /Rating><date>1512709426027< /date><Gmap_id>0x8085072c051576f1:0xef004a4a10bf4322<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Spent Valentine's Day with my fiance here. From the bread, to the amazing buffet-style salad bar, and table-side cuts of sirloin, lamb chops, ribeye, pork sausage, and may other meats. Definitely a new favorite spot for special occasions. Word of advice: if you're craving meats, skip the salad bar or go skim on it, cause the meats just keep coming! The service was FANTASTIC even for the busy dinner rush, granted they probably planned ahead for it. Everyone from the front counter to the servers with the skewered meats were just pleasant. For the price you pay, it's worth it for those hungry carnivores.< /Text>

<text>Great service grear food and quality. I am always concerned the quality in food drops when things start to become mass produced. This place however kept the quality in the meats. Chicken was cooked well and juicy. Lamb and beef were moist and flavorful. Deffiantly a must have! We Will be back hopefully sooner than later.</text></record></dataset><record>

Galpao Gaucho's is the best Brazilian restaurant we have ever been to. The steaks were extremely moist and tender. The lamb was juicy and aromatic. With all that meat being served around the restaurant our olfactory glands were working on overtime. The servers continued to ask us if we wanted more, never letting our plates to get empty. I was well impressed with the great service and how well they worked to provide my wife with a wonderful birthday meal.</Review>

While the meat offerings were tender and juicy, the flavor of the steaks offered was slightly bland.  Also, the cost of dinner for two is too cost prohibitive for frequent return visits. Specialty drinks from the bar are also overpriced.</review><Rating>4< /Rating>< Pics>

The experience was amazing. The staff professional,  attentive to our every need. The food was amazing. Everything in the salad bar was fresh and well prepared, with an array of vegetables, salads  and meats. Then every piece of succulent meat that was presented at our table to the last piece....the flavor, the quality, the taste was delicious.
This was my first time ever at a Brazilian Steak house and I will be returning.< /Text>

A return guest, I was delighted to see that my first experience with food coming out and being offered faster than I could consume it wasn't a fluke! The meat was delicious, and while the salad bar offered good variety, I was disappointed to not see many fruits for an after-meat treat. The only thing that bugged me a little was that the servers didn't notice when toasts were being given, so we had to shoo them away a few times! Poor us, we were being pestered with delicious meat!<//text>

<review>Best steak/chicken/salad bar ever! Very pricey though, with the creme brulee it added up to 150 for 2 people. But it's a great place to get stuffed and a great place to splurge!!!! So worth it!!!!<//review>< Pics>

We had the best time having lunch here. Drove 1hr and a half just to try their steaks. Every steak has its own unique texture and taste. By far the best steak we ever had!!! One of my fave is their house special steak and the spicy garlic picanha! Service wise is superb, staff was friendly and always smiling. The steak just keep on coming 🤗 , there's a wide variety of salad and appetizers on the salad bar. They deserve 10 STARS!!!.. We will definitely come back and will recommend this place for BEST STEAKHOUSE and awesome dinning experience!!!👍<//Review>

< Review>
Very good salad bar and the meat choices. We were a pay of 6 for a birthday lunch. I just did the salad bar. great choices. I had plenty food from the salad bar plus the soup,  cheeses, bacon, salami and smoke salmon were all in the the salad bar. The others did bother the salad bar and the BBQ meats.</Review>

<review>I’ll be honest, everyone was nice enough, but half of what they brought out I could have made better at home. Flavorless meat and limp shrimp. Took 20 minutes to get out check at the end of the meal. So long in fact, our table had already been bussed and reset for the next guest. They just forgot about us</review>< response>

Brazilian bbq that is both decadent and savory. Additionally, the salad bar within has enough variety to satisfy any vegan members of your party. Or you could just tell them to shut up and drink.

The only thing is, prepare to test your wallet for its generosity.</text>

I'm torn on this place. My wife has a gluten allergy, the staff was super nice but did not seem well trained in allergies. The salad bar is fresh and delicious, lots of great choices. The meat was delicious but it found it greasy, I don't eat a lot of carbs and you need something to soak up the fats. I'm really glad I did it once and I would recommend to try it but I don't know if I'll ever be back.<//Text>

<Review>Be prepared to spend but you won't regret it. This is they once a year kind of place. My favorite restaurant on planet Earth. If you're a carnivore like me, this is as close as you'll get to heaven on Earth. All the cuts of meat are perfect. The bacon at the salad bar is the best on the planet. And their soup is stellar. Try it once and you'll figure out how to budget so you can come back again.<//Review><userid>110447665883360563048<//userid>< pictures>

Loved, loved, loved it!  If I had to pick a con, I would choose Sharp Cheddar Cheese for one of the cheeses on the salad bar.  But the Filet Mignon, Lamb, and Salmon with the best passion fruit sauce in the world stunned my taste buds into happiness.  The service was amazing.  Even better than fine dining on a cruise line.  The salad bar was quite good too.  :)<//review>

Great  service.  The meats just keep coming. Salmon, shrimp,  sirloin,  filet mignon, ribeye, leg of lamb, lamb chops, bacon wrapped chicken, ribs, and so much more. Recommended you dont eat lunch prior to going. This place is awesome.  "Reservations are a must" your experience will take nearly 90 minutes or more.<//review>

The steak here was some of the best I've ever had in my life. There's quite a large selection of meats to choose from, most of which are beef. Each meat item served has its own flavor and texture, which keeps the experience fresh as you try the different items. There's also a salad bar (which has a few other items such as bread, not just salad) that you can use if you need a break from meat during your meal. The atmosphere and service is also great. Just make sure you're hungry before you come, as it's all-you-can-eat and you'll want to get your money's worth, as it's very expensive. For this reason, it's a place that's best visited for special occasions.</Text>

The food is amazing, only beaten by the fantastic service. I left absolutely stuffed to the gills, and still a little disappointed I wasn't able to try everything. This is easily one of my favorite dinner spots in Napa now.

It's a little like a buffet, with the best salad bar I've ever tried, which risks filling you up before you even get to the main course, where servers bring you all of the delicious meats. All of it was excellent, but the lamb was my favorite.<//text>

<Review>This place is all you can eat. Servers go from table to table with meat on a spit and cut a slice onto your plate. The food is delicious - take your time and don't fill up on the salad bar. My favorote meat was the spicy tenderloin.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<date>1467754836457< /date><Review>A very interactive experience when you buy the full meal.  Flip your card to green and the chefs will stop by and offer their cut of meat, flip card to red and enjoy. Very cool bar and fast and very courteous wait staff.  Buying the full meal takes the pressure off of deciding what to order, because you know that you will get to try all of the meat cuts,  and the salad bar.  They use a very impressive rotisserie which you can see slightly while looking beyond the bar into the kitchen.< /Review><UserId.>116912503449975752650< /UserId.>< Rating>

<Text>It's a hurricane of food. Amazing salad bar, but I found the meats under seasoned and greasy. There was no "wow" moment. Being a big meat eater I was disappointed by the quality vs cost. Rather go to a high end steak house like Harris'.<//Text>< Name>

Quality of meat wasvery good. Atmosphere was good as well. But the salad bar was just average, nothing special. Servers were very kind and working hard. they were serving different kinds of meats continuously without interruption. Overall experience was very good. I would like to visit again.</text>

First time there for happy hour and it was great!  Service was very attentive, drinks spot on and the food was great... two of us had 4 drinks and shared a bar snack for $55 out the door,  that's including a 20%+ tip... we'll be back again tomorrow!< /text>

Upscale but overpriced. Meat was good quality but variety was limited to cuts of meat with basic seasoning. For the price you pay - $59 per head plus drinks / dessert it's worth going to try it but wouldn't go again.<//Review>

Been here at least 10 times and counting. I go whenever I can! Always serving high quality meats with a more than satisfying salad bar. The price may seem expensive to some. But for an all-you-can eat steakhouse that serves quality meat (plus chicken, salmon and meat wrapped in bacon) along with a great/unique staff. It can't get much better. Highly recommend this place!< /review>

Lots of great meat! Good beer on draft, I had a great dark beer that went well with my dinner.
Started with the salad & cheese bar. There were four cheeses & at least five cold meats. Salad condiments included hart of palm, sushi, asparagus & many other high end goodys.
Don't overlook the hot rolls! I don't know how they are made, but they are great. Mashed cheese potatoes and fried bananas are the sides I was served.
I focused mostly on beef, with a spicy top round & the flay menon being my favorites.
Also had a Brazilian flan to finish.
Over all great food, at a fair but high end price.</Review>

This place has delicious meats and impeccable service. Extremely enjoyable the bartenders are amazing and accommodating. While it's pricey due to the all you can eat it's definitely worth the price you pay. Good cap place to cap off a day of wine tasting.<//Text>

Always a great experience. Servers are kind, always in a great mood and super accommodating. The meat preparations are en point. All you can eat can be great after a day of tasting heavy wines of Napa.

Don't go if you are looking for a quiet, uninterrupted meal. The nature of this is restaurant is interactive and you should be ready for a steady flow of meat sabers until the check comes. It's a lot of fun if you are ready for a familiar family style dinner and the meat comma that follows.

Kid friendly, if your kids like meat. Loud enough to get away with minor tantrums and servers are understanding- bringing kids cups and removing sharp knives.

Can generally sneak in without a resy, but not always.  Definitely worth a try at least once for the fun of it.</text>

Food was really good! A bit pricey, but then again it is Napa... anywhere you go other than Denny's and fast food is going to be expensive! Food was fantastic, it is an all you can eat place, and they even have cards on the tables for the meat that says yes please on one side,and no thank you on the other! There is a bar with food that you can eat, but save your appetites, because there are guys that come around with 14 different cuts of meat for you to eat! It really is a cool experience! Again it's pricey, but I highly recommend it!< /Text>

ENDLESS (!!) cuts of meat are juicy and delicious, and this place has just enough atmosphere to prove they are serious about the business, without being too good for my kind (nice pair of jeans and collared shirt is ok).  Noise level is befitting of a place full of hungry, excited customers (you may not be able to hear conversation a few seats away). Buffet with a few dozen selections of hors d'oeuvres is complementary, as is a small selection of desserts.  Drinks and other desserts can be purchased in addition.  Be prepared to spend over $75 per person, knowing that in return you will leave with a greater appreciation of the fullness of life.</review>

C’mon, you see the reviews, you see the ratings. This place is good as advertised, expensive but this isn’t a backyard BBQ! Also, expected the various meats but the pineapple was a nice touch</Text>

<name>Mn M< /name><Review>We loved the service and the food was wonderful but there were 2 things that keeps me from 5 stars.  1. They should've told us the tip would be included up front and at 20%.  I would have been more open to additional tip but the surprise was a but outputting.  2. The atmosphere wasn't quite committed to the theme of the restaurant.  It was a little confusing.< /Review><time>1522638785284<//time></record>

<review>Excellent "special occasions" restaurant... especially for us out of towners. Honest service from attentive staff who mostly spoke Portuguese to add to the authenticity. Great time for Father's Day and will be coming back every time we are in town.

Our party had over-tipped and the server made sure to catch us before we left. Of course we left a great chunk of the money we "over-tipped." Being a restaurant industry fellow, myself, I had to give them a nod in appreciation.

A definite place to revisit or check out if it's your first time.<//review>< pictures>

Visited after a Sonoma race weekend with a large group. Good food with no menu to order off of. Don't it sucked into the salad bar! Eat your meat!</text>

We had fun and ate like royalty. Salad bar was fresh and tasty with a lot of variety. The sirloin steak was my favorite, but all the meat selections were  delicious and fabulous.< /Review>

Excellent place, easy access well arranged and what i meant about it is.. it can seat a bunch of big group but you cannot feel that squeezed feeling on the table once seated, plenty of parking and very friendly servers relaxed ambiance as well.recommended to all<//Review>

I am sorry we are kind of disappointed with their food it was not worth 54$ per person. If you are person who does not eat tons of food and care about quality of food then don't go there.< /Text>

Food was excellent, abundant, expertly prepared and served. No prices on menu.  59.95 per person plus beverages and desserts. On the way home I realized we had been charged for five $11.00 desserts rather than the four we ordered. All told, five people, dinner beverages, desserts & tip came to 430.00.</Text>

Great choice of meats grilled perfectly and all you can eat--also an amazing salad table filled with delicious items--price moderate but you don't have to order a-la-carte items like in other steakhouses---
Rudy, the manager, was wonderful and really did a great job with our group--😊</review>

This place is amazing. More meat than you can eat for as long as you can stand to eat it. Wonderfully flavored and tender beef, and amazing lamb! The salad bar is a nice touch, but save room for the meat!</review>

17 unlimited select cuts of beef, chicken, pork and fish done in the wonderful Brazilian  currasco tradition. YES, it IS a pricy restaurant.. comparable to Ruth's Chris and Morton's of Chicago but the ambience, service and dinning experience make Galpao Gaucho a must try for all culinary commandos!<//text>

<Text>Cuts of (meats)cooked to perfection! Services 5 stars, salad bar great ! The only missing imo is a lack of hot food, surch as yuca( Brazilian mandioca) missing good white rice  and brasiliam feijao tropedo  , please add real Brazilian linguica not Argentina sausage, if you are a Brazilian you can  definitely tell the difference , other than that I highly recommend this place to anyone including the picky Brazilian eaters</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Ok, so I don't leave reviews ever, and I mean ever! But to put it simply this place has delivered for me twice in my life. The first time being my 3rd date with the woman I ended up marrying, the 2nd time being my wedding reception. My wife an her family are from Brazil and I wanted to make sure they felt at home. The level of service, quality of food and overall joy throughout the entire experience made it a memorable time. All I can say is show up hungry and ready for meat because even skipping breakfast and lunch, I didn't have enough room for the train of delicious meat. This is authentic Brazilian food and an experience given with love an care. Thanks again to this amazing place.< /Review>

Great food, great service, and overall great ambience. Parking gets tricky, though, because it is located right beside an inn.<//review>

I've been to one other steakhouse like this in Rosevile, which I thought could not be beat. I don't know if the Food beat the service here, or vice versa, but both were beyond my expectations. I never write reviews, but this place was even worthy of me asking for management, to express my appreciation!< /Review>

The chefs don't allow you to choose what size you want your meat in. Besides they don't offer bins for your leftovers<//Review>

< Review>
Went here on Saturday and enjoyed excellent, friendly service and a great meal. We did feel a bit rushed though. Atmosphere is noisy and decor is a bit uninspired. Drinks were expensive even for Napa. Meat selection was not as extensive as some Brazilian BBQs I've been to, but everything was well prepared and full of flavor. Worth the visit and will go back.<//Review>

The only place to go when hungry for steak and other varieties of meat. If you're not a meat eater they have an awesome salad bar that is much more than that.</Text>

A place that you must visit in Napa!  The quality of food and service was beyond our expectation. The ambience is also great, it is probably the most beautiful  restaurant in Napa.< /review>

<Text>As a Brazilian it really impressed me and the also Brazilian staff made it a good experience.
Good food. Lots of meat.
But I'd just suggest to add brigadeiro e mousse de maracujá as a dessert option.
One other idea would be to have Brazilian wine there.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I visited the restaurant with my wife for my birthday dinner over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.

We were greeted at our table by our waiter JJ. He is Brazilian and was fun to talk with. He gave us the lowdown on how the restaurant worked since it was our first time in a Brazilian steakhouse.

We started at the salad bar which was much more then that. Smoked salmon, vegetables, sushi, cheese and much more. Be careful not to eat much to save room for the main course.

We also had Pao de Queijo which is Brazilian cheese bread. So good but don't fill up.

We were then told to turn over these cards at our table when we were ready to eat. They had red on one side and green in the other for obvious reasons.

We went green and waiter after waiter came by our table to slice of tender goodness of bottom Sirloin, top sirloin, braised rib, lamb chops, filet minion with and without bacon. On and on everything was delicious. Salmon, sausages, ribs all tender and mouth watering. We had to turn over the red card a few times.

After dinner JJ brought out a birthday chocolate molton desert for my wife and I to share. Outstanding.

Overall experience great. Food awesome. You will not leave hungry. On the pricey side but worth it.< /text>

My favorite restaraunts in Napa...always a wonderful experience. The salad bar never disappoints...the pão de queijo is delicious, the sides for the bbqs...would love to go here every week! As a vegetarian there are still great options...this is a meat eaters paradise. The wine menu is superb and The desserts are fantastic.  The service is outstanding. Love love this place!< /Text>

Wow. Too amazing for words yet I will attempt to convey the sheer pleasure as well as satisfaction of experience we had today.
My husband and I arrived early for dinner service ( we left home early not knowing that the restaurant was so easily located right off the freeway with very clear signs) which began promptly at 5pm.
Although we were early by about 15 min we were greeted most generally by the hostess who seated us at a table by the bar with not one but three menus to order a multitude of dishes and cocktails to pass the time.
I went to wash my hands and found that the bathroom was not simply clean but had a scent of flowers. It was similar to a fresh spring bouquet.
I was again amazed by the beautiful fountain that greeted me at the sink. Quite unique in that it resembled an antique wine pump. Truly amazing. I had to ask my husband to "go and wash your hands" because I knew I couldn't describe it and give it the awe inspiring description it deserved.
He loved the attention to detail as well (I also told him I would love that to be an addition to our bathroom remodel).
The restaurant is simply beautiful. Upscale, classy yet without pretense.
A fancy gala or (as we were in) jeans and shorts are all completely comfortable.
As we were greeted and attended to by many staff, one of which took our drink order promptly as well as bringing soft, warm, egg shaped and sized bread in a basket that brought back memories of my mother's home made bread with home made yeast, full of love and flavor. Delicately crispy crust with a warm and tender inside...Mmmmm.
Before I knew it we were being seated. She gave us our choice. Nice touch.
We started at the ample salad bar. Not wanting to fill up on salad as this was our first experience at an all you can eat Brazilian bbq, I limited my choices to the asparagus, cheeses, chicken salad, brown bread and butter. Too delicious!
Then the meats begin to come.
The entire staff is welcoming. Our server kindly explaining the way it all works and how to get more from the menu. The laughter, the quality, the atmosphere, the attention to detail. Every detail. Even when I wanted to save the rack of lamb bones for our dogs (we have three), it was not simply accommodated but done without hesitation.
I ate more than I've ever managed. Ribeye, rack of lamb, sirloin, salmon, filet and more. Most was cooked to perfection. The salmon was dry but saved by a bit of lemon and the sweet yet tart sauce served with it. The end pieces of sirloin my husband had were a bit tough but only in comparison to the melt in your mouth meats the proceeded it.
When one of the meat entrees was not in circulation, I had but to ask and it was moments later on my plate.
I have not had such a euphoric dining experience in over 20 years.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
There are many places with 5 star or close to 5 star ratings. But  we have been disappointed by most. On the other hand... YOU all, truly deserve it! We will be dining again and again. Most importantly we will be singing your praises and bring others to enjoy the pleasure of dining with you!
Thank you for a world class experience at Galpao Goucho in Napa!<//review>

<review>I barely had one plate of meat and felt rushed out. Bus lady was clearing everything off the table before we can put down our eating utensils. Didn't ask if we were done. Not worth the $60 if you can't enjoy and take your time eating your dinner.< /review>< rate>

<Review>(Translated by Google) This Brazilian restaurant is very elegant with a large table area, although the number of people who come are mostly tourists, it is very likely that you have to wait half an hour to an hour, I recommend you make a reservation and it is still usually that you Touch wait a few minutes. Your experience in this place begins with an orientation of your waiter where he tells you that you can have access to the whole salad area that is very varied and then they explain that you have a type of red and green button that means that you are ready to start enjoying the 17 different meats among them can be, chicken, shrimp, sheep, salmon, beef in its different cuts, ribs, pork etc, when you want more you put your button up with the color green and if you want more you put it in red, and all these options are inside the firm for a price of $ 62 per person and drinks like wine per glass costs an average of $ 15, beer for 6 dollars and any other drink for an average of 12 dollars and desserts are not inside the firm and cost on average 12 to 15 dollars, but in general the service is good although nothing extraordinary, but if you can consider a romantic place, In general I can say that in general you get an average of $ 100 plus tip, well if you are willing to live something like that I recommend it.

<Review>(Translated by Google) This Brazilian restaurant of great elegance, is designed with a buffet style where you sit and then they give you an orientation by the waiter who touches you then he explains to you about a green button on one side and red on the side other this means that when it is green any of those that bring you one of 17 options of cards with their different cuts and like a type of cooking you want to receive to eat as it can be well cooked, half cooked or a little raw and It can be starter, lamb, chicken, fish among other options and there is a wide variety of salads, soups, cheeses or other sandwiches in the salad area where you serve yourself and as many times as you want, a personal recommendation is that if you know that you Like just eat that because there are many options and if you eat everything without choosing it may be that when you get to what you like more you will already be very full, as it is worth mentioning this place is a bit expensive 63 dollars per pers ona more apart drinks are paid that a good wine per 8-ounce glass comes out at 15 dollars and a beer at approximately 6 dollars and very delicious desserts among which the three Brazilian-style milks, chocolate with ice cream are two options for an approximate of 15 dollars each in general is a very beautiful and delicious experience if you take it easy and live everything to the fullest, in general I can say that an unforgettable experience for about one hundred dollars per person plus tips, if you dare to live something New in unforgettable.
