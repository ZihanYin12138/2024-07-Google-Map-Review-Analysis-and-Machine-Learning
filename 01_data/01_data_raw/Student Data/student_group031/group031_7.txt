<Review>Excellent place to mattress shop! Big variety to choose from. I didn’t get the car salesman vibe you get from some places. Tomika was amazing! She was so helpful and very knowledgeable. I was able to find the perfect mattress thanks to her help, which is very much appreciated.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>I had a great experience at this store. Amanda was able to walk me through the process of finding the perfect mattress for me. Since having my new mattress I have never slept better. Also, being new to the area I was looking for a reputable place to purchase additional furniture and had no idea where to go. Amanda referred me to a local furniture store that had exactly what I was looking for and at almost half the price of what I had seen it for at another store in the area. This is where I will be coming if I ever need additional bedding. I highly recommend this store.< /text><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

I had a really good experience at Mattress Land. Amanda, a store representative, was able to help me find the perfect mattress for me and my budget. She was patient, not pushy, and very attentive. I could not have asked for better service. I will be sure to return here for any other mattress purchases.</text>

Was a very positive experience.  I had just walked out of another store for not being treated with even a little bit of respect.
I will share the positive experience with friends and family.< /Review>

Amanda was amazing! She went out of her way to help me get the right mattress set in a hurry for my aging mom who was moving to an assisted living facility in 2 days. I was literally driving around town in a rented moving van looking for a bed and not only did Mattress Land  have what I needed available to pick up the same day but I also had a choice of mattresses. And I got a great price. Satisfied customer here.< /Text>

Incredible location to get a new mattress. Compared to other locations, they had the best prices for the specific type of mattress I required (side sleeper). The sales representatives, specifically Amanda, that helped me were very open about their return, exchange, refund policy when I asked about any concerns I had. She made the process very straightforward and simple and I was able to get a mattress very quickly. They also offer curbsdie drop off with no additional cost. Nonetheless, I had a great experience and would suggest Mattress Land for getting a new mattress and a good night's rest !<//review>

A great mattress-buying experience. Amanda was very knowledgeable and patient while my fiancée and I tested mattresses and asked questions. Hopefully won’t need another new mattress for quite a while but I would absolutely come back here. Good buying incentives on the premium mattresses along with great financing options made for an easy purchase.<//text>

I was so lucky today to find information out about a new mattress - by text, online and by telephone. My thanks go to John, who so patiently helped me select what I was looking for; and to Amanda - who called me to go through my order, process the payment and put me in line for delivery tomorrow.  Super service - so much appreciated 😊

My mattress was delivered on Saturday - the delivery men were prompt and efficient.  The mattress was carefully placed on my platform frame and I received my other two items, along with a recommendation to read the washing and drying instructions.

I will recommend this MatressLand store to others.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /review>

Tomika was friendly, helpful, and committed to finding the right fit for my partner and me. She found the perfect mattress for us and sat politely through our bickering while we went round and round to ultimately choose her first suggestion. Thank you for your time, Tomika; it was a pleasure!</Review>

Bought a mattress and box spring from this place.  Sales lady was great.  After that it went down hill.   Waited 9 weeks because of covod to finally get delivered.

I got it set up, one of the box springs didn't come with paper work. The delivery guy made a not about it.  Fast forward 3 months and that box spring is broke.

I call them out because they have a warranty and they denied my warranty.  Haha for improper use.  The box spring that was probably defected already and the reason they had no paper work it now mine.

What a joke. Why have delivery and have your team set it up if they are setting it up incorrectly and violating your warranty to begin with.   Your own company basically violated the Warranty for me when they set it up.< /Text>

My boyfriend and i were in the market for a new bed but weren’t quite sure what we wanted.  Tomika Strobehn was our Sleep Advisor and she was awesome from start to finish! She was very informative and was more than happy to answer any questions we had.  She did her best to make sure we were happy with the mattress and the price and she wasn’t pushy at all.  It was clear that customer satisfaction was her main goal and not the sale itself.  If anyone is in the market for a new mattress I highly recommend you go see Tomika, you won’t regret it!<//Review>

She went above and beyond,to say the least, to help us walk out with the mattress we fell in love with! Thank you Amanda for the great customer service you provided and for not giving up!<//Review>

<Review>Hello to anyone that may be reading this review. I can honesty say without a doubt that my day of visit on December 12, 2020 was absolutely amazing! I went with a friend that day to just look at mattresses and see the prices. As soon as I stepped into Mattress Land located at 3658 Ming Ave. Bakersfield CA. The sleep advisor TOMIKA STROBEHN approached me and my friend. At first I thought I was going to get the question “what are you guys looking for?” straight of the bat. However, I was proven wrong Tomika welcoming felt like someone that was inviting me to there house to have a cup of coffee with laughter and joy. I never felt pressured or anxious when I was talking to her. Tomika was amazing help with being patient and understanding about my situation about purchasing a mattress. She showed me a variety of mattresses that were around my price range and some that were ONLY in store deals. Also, if I may say she’s not there to sell you the most expensive mattress but really cares about the clients that come through those doors. As we started to discuss about numbers(prices) she offered me a deal that I couldn’t refuse. In all honesty I even questioned if she was able to do that offer but without a doubt she was not playing around. At that very moment I took my card out and said let’s do this. So if anyone that wants to seek or wants to get informed about a mattress I would highly recommend you stopping by Mattress Land and asking for TOMIKA STROBEHN to assist you! Whoever is reading this review you have nothing to worry about! She is here to help you and that’s a promise! Happy holidays everyone!

Thank you, Tomika Strobehn!

<review>Came in knowing exactly what we were looking for. We were studied up on what we needed and just wanted a “quickly” transaction. Sales man, John, took us straight to options that met our specifications... it was a very pleasant experience to have a salesperson who was knowledgeable but not “pushy” in anyway.  We left feeling heard and like we paid a very fair price.  Can’t ask for more then that... well, you guys could make my bed?!  Lol.< /review>< Pictures>

Our experience at Mattress Land was awesome! Josh was very helpful in determining what mattress comfort type my mother needed and was very knowledgeable about the mattress brands. Josh made it easy for us to make a choice and purchase a mattress set. Thank you Josh for being informative and for making it such an easy purchase. We plan to to come back for future purchases.

<review>Tomika Strobehn was a great sales rep, she took the time to show us mattresses that both I and my girlfriend would love (we’re very picky) and even talked us through price ranges to make sure it was the perfect fit for us.

Omg! Tomika is awesome! After checking out different mattress stores I went straight back to her at Mattress Land! She completely got my personality and while addressing all of my concerns never once made me feel like she was simply trying to make a sale!

I appreciate her and my whole experience! I am so happy with my choice and cannot wait until I get to sleep on it!

I also met Josh and we had a fun time comparing mattresses to cars! It was awesome!

Great experience for sure!

Thank you guys!</review>

Tomika assisted me in finding a mattress that not only fit my budget but was very comfortable. She had me use the mattress fit to see what kind of mattress I needed so that I got the best support. I felt that she truly wanted me to get the right mattress and wasn’t worried about just making a sale. After testing out different mattresses and seeing which one was right for me I purchased the nectar memory foam. Great mattress and great staff at Mattress Land.

We have had waterbeds from 1974 on so this was a new experience. Our sales person was so sweet. She worked with us showing us every bed in our “sleep range” even some that weren’t so we would see what was out of our range. We were so satisfied when we left . AAA . We haven’t gotten the bed yet but 👍🏼 Thumbs up so far!!</text>

< Review>
I just had a great experience here. Marissa was great! I came in less than 30 minutes before they closed and didn't feel rushed into buying anything. I was given time to figure out what mattress felt the best to me. Marissa was very knowledgeable about the mattress I picked. She seemed to have a LOT of experience. I haven't had the same experience anywhere else, and I've been everywhere it seems. I got the best deal in town by far here. Make sure this store is on your list and make sure to ask for her. Marissa has upper management written all over her. You can tell by the surge of great reviews they have been getting, she is a keeper. Thank you Marissa!< /Review>

< review>
My husband and I have been looking for a bed, but we wanted to get a good deal and the best bed possible at the same time. I met Marissa from Mattress Land and told her about the beds we looked at preciously. She told me that she actually had the same bed on clearance. Also, that there were plenty of others to choose from as well if we chose to go a different route. Marissa was so professional and personable, making us feel comfortable and not pressured during the whole experience. We ended up getting an upgrade to the one we previously looked at, along with amazing pillows all for a price lower than was quoted to us elsewhere. We are so grateful for coming here and being treated so well. If we ever need another bed, I know we are coming here. They have an amazing selection for all sleepers and the best deals in town. Highly recommended!</review>

< review>
I really enjoyed my experience at Mattress Land, I walked in a few days ago to check out some mattresses because I’ve had my current mattress for about 8+ years now. I was amazed at how far the technology has come now! They have this cool bed sleep fit thing that analyzes you and tells you what comfort level is perfect for your body and sleep type. Just like the Dr Scholls machine Does when you buy gel inserts. Besides that they have very friendly and knowledgeable staff, who are genuinely just trying to get you in a better bed and better state of sleep. They carry some really nice brands as well, I didn’t get a bed on my visit but I plan on returning for sure to get my mattress from here. I don’t normally post reviews like this but I felt like I needed to! Thanks Mattress Land.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>My husband and I went into Mattress Land SleepFit on Sunday at 5:45 pm.  They close at 6:00 pm and we were hoping we had enough time to purchases a mattress that same day. Felicia was great, she has amazing customer service skills and my husband and I were blown away at how professional and honest she was.  Honesty is very rare in a sales type position and we were grateful. My husband and I both walked away feeling like this was the best experience we have had by far for such a large purchase. Felicia gave us a great deal and worked right within our budget, which was extremely helpful considering we are expecting! We felt Felicia went above and beyond to assist us with our purchase even staying over 30 minutes after they were closed! Usually stores push you out or make you come back the next day with coming in so close to closing time.

We have yet to receive our mattress as it will be delivered on Saturday, but as soon as we do I will update this review for the mattress itself!

I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking to find a good deal on a nice mattress with AMAZING customer service!!!

Thank you Mattress Land and FELICIA!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Most Exelante as Always. This Place Tiki s has a facility that is clean and comfortable at the price. That is equal w the Competition of other Motels in MODESTO. There is a adjoining public Social Watering Hole(BAR) next door. Very good atmosphere w/a Beer garden. Well Managed Place also. The staff is friendly and kind and runs their buissness very professionally as I have been a visitor and neighbor for 2 years.</text>

< review>
We arrived in Modesto from Dallas late. This bar sits surrounded by a motel (Tiki Motel). We thought about staying at the motel, then walking over to bar- lol- my husband goes to the motel window, presents his Texas ID, and the motel manager says, “you don’t wanna stay here or any motel on McHenry. There’s lots of drugs, we do family relocation, and the police are here all the time.” He suggested places out on Hwy 99- which we did find! Thank you!

After in our hotel we went back to the bar. We had been traveling all day and needed a few drinks before calling it a night.

We parked out back. Parking is tiny. Based upon our prior research- this is the “best gay bar” in Modesto. It looked kinda “dive bar”- but we do “dive bar well”

First in you are “hard carded” for ID- then metal detector run over you. That’s wild! Only in REALLY BAD dive bars have we ever seen this.

We took a seat at the bar. The chairs/stools are something right outta  “Pier one imports“ - the padding’s on the bar edges terribly worn out. The seating in back is red and worn- inside is TINY! This place is small!

We had a few drinks and crowd began to pickup. Most seemed like your typical “Jr college rural” crowd. The bar is definitely “dive bar quality”. If this is “the best in Modesto”- I’m terrified at what the other looks like.

There were some local  street “urchins” from the tiki hotel wandering around- so I guess the metal detector makes sense. This is a rough part of town it seems- based upon our observations and what we were told.

Drinks were on par with most bars in price and quality- we left before midnight as to not risk being in the area to long.</review>

<Response>None< /Response><review>This place has really gone downhill. It wants to be a nightclub when it grows up, but what it is, has been, and excels at being is a neighborhood bar. The drinks keep getting weaker while the prices keep going up. When the owners realize that what they have is a good neighborhood gay bar, it'll be a nice place to go. Until then, it's just a sad little nightclub.</review><UserId.>106485886206863914743<//UserId.><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

You guys are dangerous. Driving for Uber last night I picked up a guy and his sister from your bar and the girl was so drunk her brother carried her out. She was completely unconscious coming out of the bar, the entire ride home when she threw up in my car and then her brother carried her in the house. If her brother wasn't there would you have taken care of you'r customers? Oh I highly doubt that as I stopped being a customer there years ago for your sloppy bartending and customer service.<//review>

I been coming here for a couple days and I spent money on a weekly. I slowly realized there were roaches and bugs in the room but I still stayed. The next morning the toilet plugs up and overflows. There was toilet water everywhere. My boyfriend asked them if they can fix it and if we can get the room cleaned up. We waited 2 hours before I went myself and asked to switch rooms. They said no. That I had to have Joe the maintenance man unplug the toilet. When he came in he was very rude when all I asked for was a clean room. He told me if I don't like it then leave. And then he walked away left the mess and the toilet. I really recommend not coming here. You get what you pay for tho. Cheap hotel, cheap bad service. 👌👎<//Text>

<review>I went there last night with friends. I have a female to male friend who the security gaurd wouldn't let in because the ID was andrea where now he is andrew. It's understandable with the major appearance diffrence but most other bars just ask for a bank card with the same name as the ID. Nope, this guy was a jerk. Made him wait to check a line full off people that were behind us first before making Andrew write his female name 5 times in front of a crowd of people. From an "LGBT-friendly" bar?? That was BS!<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Caliber Collision not only rocks, it RULES! The catalytic converter was stolen off our Prius and there was a 20 car wait for a new one from the dealer. Because my wife and I were only visiting in San Diego when this happened, Linda at Caliber was able to get us to the head of the line and managed to get the converter replaced in less than a weeks time, saving us some serious bucks in hotel expenses. And in addition, we were able to leave the Enterprise rental car at Caliber when we picked up our car, saving us the time and hassle of returning it to the rental company. Really outstanding, exemplary and phenomenal service. Suffice to say, I cannot recommend this shop enough!<//Review>

<review>Luis took absolutely special care of my rig.  There was never any question about what was going on day in and day out.  Any issue with insurance he handled and gave me the update.  The love and care he put into my truck has made him part of my family.  Thank you brother and to all those who assisted.< /review>< Pictures>

Caliber Collision was amazing!  They worked on corrective repairs from another repair bodyshop botched attempt.   Caliber Collision were extremely patient while the insurance company worked out some issues and keeping me informed.  They did an amazing job and exceeded my expectations with their professionalism.  I recommend it for everyone because it important to choose a shop to that gets it right the first time.  The staff is amazing!<//review>

<review>I just had recent experience last week Tuesday with this company. On October 6,I had got in accident which messed up just my whole passenger side as you can see in the pictures.That same day when I stepped in Caliber I was welcome and given good customers service by the receptionist and Mr. Luis. While they had my car Mr. Luis kept in touch very often.They also had  text message system that kept me with the latest update in which status my car was in.My car stayed with them week and two days after the day they originally told me.My car is odd color so the first painting they did Mr. Luis called me days before the original expected date I was going get my car saying he was not please how the color came out.I respected him for that too.He could had me pick my car up knowing the color did not match but he did not.I also had other paint damaged on my car not from the accident Caliber took care of that I did not asked them too.They even replace my lights too.:)I  thought that was nice of them where it save me time and money trying figure out how to get them repairs taking care of.I highly recommend this company! I want thank the whole staff for my recent experience with them.I am very pleased with my car and the service they provided.Shout to Mr. Luis again he was the one I interacted the most.

<review>I wish there was a lower rating. Caliber collision save yourself from the second accident of using their services. I called a month ahead to schedule a 2-3 day bumper replacement. The bumper did not arrive until the second day the car was in the shop. On day 3 I received a call informing me the paint was peeling and the bumper had to be removed and repainted. I was told the car should be ready the next day. Day 4 I received no phone call and when I called the office my call was not returned. After a few mile walk to the shop Linda had said she called and left a message. My phone does not have voicemail. Day 5 I received not call and had to walk back to to find out my car would hopefully done by the end of the day. Restore the rhythm of your life by avoiding Caliber.<//review></record>

< Review>
The ladies in the office were great and maybe this would have been a 5star if i worked with them from the beginning. Instead i worked with Luis who honestly didn't care about me just wanted to get the car in and out.
Unfortunately my car came out of this shop missing push pin in my bumper and making rattling noise under the car. Thank God for my dash-cam! I was able to find that the lift system they used completely knocked my exhaust system off the hookers. It took me 24hrs to figured out the issue but it shouldn't have been an issue at all.  The Manager Wendi was very nice and understanding when i told her i just don't trust there work after finding this issue.

This repair shop is not for tuner or modded cars!!</Review>

Brought my car in because I was rear ended on the freeway, and Junior took great care of me! The entire process was explained clearly and thoroughly, the repairs went great, and my car came back looking brand new! In addition, the front office was clean, organized, and had wonderful customer service - providing snacks and beverages for waiting customers. Seriously nothing but great things to say about this place; I definitely recommend.</Text>

Brought in my Camry to have front  right head lamp  replaced due to a faulty one the first time it was installed. The whole process was painless and quick. Luis Hernandez  and Wendi Lopez from the Bay Park location went above and beyond, also Andrew from the Mira Mesa location went above and beyond. I would recommend their services to anyone. Thank you.</text>

<text>Caliber Collision was the recommended shop through Geico following my accident. From the moment I arrived till my car was completed, the staff at Caliber have been amazing. I received weekly updates on the status of repairs. My insurance covered a rental for 30 days. I was rear-ended and I was worried about structural damage which was identified on their assessment too so the car took longer than initially expected but Caliber covered the additional days because it took longer than their initial estimated time. Jr was my point person there and he did a great job of keeping me in the loop and addressed any concerns I had. Even after my repairs were completed, I thought maybe the alignment was a little off so they took care of that too and provided me with a rental. The level of service was stellar throughout the whole process and I would recommend their services to anyone without hesitation. My car looks and drives just like before the accident. I hope I don't require their services again in the future, but if I do, I will definitely come back to Caliber Collision.

I only have comparison for repairs like this one other time. I had only been in one accident prior to this and I had my repairs done through a dealership at that time and my experience was very different there. At the dealership, my repairs took longer without covering the additional time and the repairs at that time did not look as seamless as the job that Caliber did.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The prices are competitive & they've had an .89c soda fountain since b4 McD's even thot about it, F'sho'!

Gas prices cannot save the ridiculousness of this gas station. Cannot use any form of credit cards and get charged .35 extra for debit cards.< /Review>

<review>My girlfriend had a terrible experience at this gas station.  She handed the cashier two 20-dollar bills to buy $40 worth of gas.  While she was filling up, the pump stopped at $20.  She questioned the clerk and he said that she only gave him $20, and that is what he added to the pump.  She asked to see the surveillance video, and he told her that he would have the manager look at it the next morning. She had to make countless phone calls to get them to look into it.  They finally returned her call, and admitted that she indeed paid $40.  They told her to come in the following day so that she could fill the remaining $20 of gas.  So, she had to return to this gas station again.  They never even apologized or offered her compensation in any way for their mistake< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

I will never shop there again.  I went there tonight to purchase 15 dollars in gas.  I was charged 16.38 and was not able to pump the gas.  The clerk said that he had put everything in correctly and that I should be able to pump the gas.  I was not given an original receipt so the second clerk that was there had to reprint the receipt.  When she did she noticed that I had been charged for something  other than gas but I did not purchase anything else.  When I asked them for a refund I was told that the only person that could do that was the manager and that he would not be there until the following morning.  Now I have to go back in the morning to try and get my money back.  This is very unprofessional.< /text>

I loved the shrimp cocktail! It was full of flavor and really didn't need anything to be added into it. My children didn't want seafood, so we were glad that the menu included breakfast items at 4pm! Very good service. The only downside was that it looked a little dirty. There were crumbs all over our booth and on the floor. Seeing that upon arriving made me think twice about staying, but overall, glad I did.< /text>

We ordered the Tostada de cevichè de Cameron (cooked shrimp) and a cevichè de pulpo(octopus) & fish. It was about $12 for tge octopus & fish cevichè & $6.99 for the shrimp tostadas. Both were great. Quick &Friendly service but little parking. No outdoor dinning, Take out only* (3/20/21)</review>< Pics>

Got a shrimp and octopus cocktail. The cocktail was good but needed more flavor. Shrimp tacos were bland. The only thing you can taste was the salsa alicante they provide. Which is really delicious actually. But pretty much, the chips and salsa side was better than the meal.< /Text>

The food had that authentic Mexican American flavor. We had the breakfast menu chilaquiles con salsa rojo, huevos con chorizo and the chuleta con huevo definitely a must try.</Text><user>107768703916492125058< /user>< response>

<review>Came by this little spot today for lunch service was fast and friendly.
Food was prepared in timely manner.
Ordered med shirmp cocktail and wet burrito had two Bohemia beers only thing I'd change is beer temp wasn't as cold enough .
shirmp was a lil soft and had too much cilantro in cocktail.
other then that food was good ..</review><date>1538686295878< /date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Not so happy I was grabbing prawns but they gave me kemados and talludos regularly boy to another place but this one made me more dry and I decided to try there but I do not like it at all then the person k attends grabs the chips with his hand and without gloves not there k to be so delicate but in the times k we are there k to see where the sanitation orders follow

(Translated by Google) Raw shrimp ceviche had no flavor. As much as I put lemon, salt and tapatio I just didn't know good. Marline's taco was also not good. I went to the place because they recommended it to me but I won't be back!

(Original)
Ceviche de camaron crudo no tenia sabor. Por mas que le puse limon, sal y tapatio nomas no sabia bueno. Tambien el taco de Marline no estaba bueno. Fui al lugar por que me lo recomendaron pero no vuelvo!</Review>

(Translated by Google) Good customer service, only that the place needs more cleaning, is a bit neglected.

This is my go-to shop. I have always shopped for my own parts and upgrades, I bring it, they assemble it, resulting in an exhaust system well worth the money and always under budget. And if you're not into chasing parts yourself, he'll have that covered as well. Here is the #003, "6th ✴" I have ever given.< /review>

My muffler was falling off my '94 K2500 4X4. I call her 'the
beast'... she's been ridden hard up in the hills, but is well taken care of. I'm picky about only quality work being done on her. These guys did exactly what I needed, exactly like I wanted it done. It was good work too, cause its held up to 6 more months of beating around up in the hills👍. Couldn't be happier. Keep it up guys👍<//text>

These guys are seriously the best! I brought them my car after other shops said what I wanted couldn’t be done. I have a difficult exhaust configuration but they took the time to look at my vehicle and discuss my options. Other muffler shops wouldn’t even put my car on a lift and look.

The work done was top notch quality and the service could not be better. If you want excellent work, friendly service, and all around great people then look no further!< /review>

After jumping from muffler shop to muffler shop getting quotes, I landed at hands down the BEST muffler shop with the most affordable prices in the greater Sacramento region. The owner is Awesome, informative and a genuine funny guy. I will never take my car or allow anyone I know to go anywhere other than NO LIMIT! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ thanks boss man!</text>

They are not only professional but they were so welcoming and a joy to be around. They did an amazing job on my exhaust and gave one heck of a deal.

I have been here a few times and will never go anywhere else. They can do anything you need from simple exhaust repairs, to one of a kind systems that look amazing and work exceptionally well. They also do custom metal work for old school trucks and cars that are truly a work of art. They have always given me the best product for my money by providing the high quality of service. There’s no reason to ever go anywhere else. Thanks no limit!</review>

These guys are awesome! They do a great job for a good price, they're it done quick, and they dont haggle around tying to get you to buy extra parts. They find out what you want and do that exactly. Great friendly people!</review>

<review>I had initially had issues with the work I had done here and wrote a pretty critical review. However, Josh, the owner had reached out to me and went above and beyond to work it out with me.

He already had my money and could have told me to take a hike, but instead told me to come back and it would be taken care of.

I'm now very happy and wish I would have just made my dissatisfaction known while I was there in the first place because I'm certain he would have made it right in the first place.

Customer service on point!</review><gmapID>0x809b2041fd2eda5b:0x82f0ef4f283fd0ec<//gmapID>< Response>

<Review>My experience with No Limit was a very positive one.  I have a 1980 F150 and it needed a Catalytic converter to pass smog.  With the truck having already failed I was seriously feeling I may have to sell this truck.  He put me good to go in about an hour and the price was so right I refuse to even bring it up.  I feel like I ripped him off.  I passed the smog with room to spare after he did what he does.    The receptionist is also very people person people.  She had great phone etiquette.  She quoted me a price that seemed very low and he did it for even less than that.  They are a small shop with lots of word of mouth going on.  The word is good.  I'm going back with the wife's Honda.  The muffler is about to fall off. .< /Review>< rating>

< Review>
Made an appointment at No Limit for 9 30, around when they open. I showed up on time and the place was locked up like they weren't even open. When I called the number they have displayed on google a woman answered saying that the employee who opens the business in the morning was running 15 minutes late. I waited patiently since I knew it would be a minute now anyways. In total I waited 50 minutes outside of no limit and still no one showed up. I left and got my truck worked on within 20 minutes else where. This is my first experience at No Limit and definently my last.< /Review>

Josh and Sharon treat you like family. This is the best muffler shop I’ve visited or rather best shop I’ve visited in a long time. Super knowledgeable, straight forward, will save you money and time by doing it well and right the first time. I took in my 08’BMW M3 and got a custom MoD on the muffler. Josh did a great job and I am very pleased with the results. Thanks No Limit:-)<//text>

<Text>Josh is a consummate professional. I have received nothing but the best service and have spent a substantial amount of time at this shop having work done on my car. I have observed Josh do things for his customers that no other shop would do. I can’t say enough good things about No Limit.</Text><user_name>Ken Ferreira</user_name></record></dataset><record>

I had a broken hanger and snapped weld plate on my exhaust, pulled in and was told to cut in front to get welded up in less than 5 minutes... NO CHARGE.. Josh and his boyz at No Limit always make it right in seconds... I'm sad to be moving away but will make the drive for Fabrication and exhaust any day< /Review>

<review>I went there for a quote. Josh told me how much and that he could do it right then. I was nervous because it's a new car but he took amazing care of it. It sounds and looks amazing. Great work and price. Thank you so much Josh.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Went a while back to try and replace the muffler on my brother's car. The female that was there was friendly and helpful, but due to frustration from what looks like a pulled engine, an employee yelled at us about what to do for the car in not the most friendly of manners.  Thankfully we turned down the offer because due to California's new stupid law, it would've been illegal.<//Text></record>

I went in to have the cats on bank 1 replace on my toyota and they messed up and changed bank 2, i didn't find out till i took it to my mechanic on Tuesday(memorial day weekend so sunday nd Monday were closed), i went back after the weekend and they 1st) tried arguing that we said passenger side when we had made it clear it was bank1 never said passenger or driver side and then 2nd) tried forcing us to buy a new one when we just wanted the old one they took off of bank 2(which was perfectly fine) to be placed on bank 1, i spoke to their lead guy and tried explaining what had happened and that everyone makes mistakes that we just wanted it fixed. and the guy(Josh i believe) responded that he was a genius that he didn't make mistake and after speaking to my mechanic(who regularly sends them customers) they chose not to do it. Absolutely pathetic service, I would not recommend anyone to go there. Do not waste your time<//Text>

<Review>I called and asked about a basic muffler for my 92 Ford PU, I was quoted a price of
$90.00 door.  Without a doubt  a very good price.  Arrived following morning greeted by the employees, told them I had been quoted 90.00, and without any issue they began the work on my truck.  I was in and out in 35 minutes with absolutely no hassle whatsoever.  The business rocks and anybody looking for good fast service at an affordable price needs to give these folks a call.</Review><gmapID>0x809b2041fd2eda5b:0x82f0ef4f283fd0ec< /gmapID>< Rating>

So i went saturday to get my bank 1 cat replace i was recomended to go there by my mechanic on my toyota sequioa and they replace the wrong one they replace bank 2 . I ran my truck for like 100 miles that same day the check engine light came on and then i Erase the codes and ranned it  but the light came back on. So i told my mechanic he checked it and said they put the wrong one. Went back told them and they wanted me to buy another one turns out another guy had the same issue they kept saying they had already talk to me then i check Their reviews and saw the guy who had the same issue had already commented his experience same like mine and they kept saying they had already spoken with me. Josh was  kept saying he was a genius that he did not make mistake and i believe everyone makes mistake and josh not only made two same mistake he also seem he  does not know which bank is which and doesnt do his job right and scans the vehicles before working on them.He's a pathetic Arrogant person I believe Customers come first. I do not recomend this place and if for some reason you do makes sure You let Genius Josh that bank 1 on A toyota is the driver side</review>

Had an issue with the Catalytic Converters on my 2003 Astro van.

Josh understanding the need for this vehicle to be running for my family proceeded to get us in and out as quickly as possible. Not only was he able to do that but he actually saved me about $200 on my repair from other quotes I had.

It has now been about a month and the vehicle is running great. His workmanship is high quality.

So if you want to support an honest family man - her is the place to go!< /review>

I was completely taken advantage of and paid way over price for the work I had done, on top of that they wouldn't warranty any of the work,  I'll definitely go to one of the many other muffler shops in sacramento over this place. Very bad customer service. They were smoking weed while working on my car.< /review>

<Review>Great prices. Got dealer direct parts and hooked up material cost at lower rate than dealer in and out less than 2 hours. Saved 500$ compared to dealer only part/install estimate. Go here theyll have you fixed up in a jiff. Great job to the owner. Mr. Ford.  Thanx for the hook up.</Review>< pictures>

Bought numerous things there over the years friendly privately owned wrecking yard, with a few RVs an a few boats along with a ton of older model cars and trucks, not to mention all the late model stuff.   This is a recommended yard with only a $1 entry fee and reasonable prices on parts plus driveshaft service and a vast knowledge of thier inventory.</text>

<review>I am A fan of U & I because I've had the pleasure to know the owner and his daughter's Kim, Katty and Kelly with my luck I am wrong on the name's and John Katty's husband I think I was 14. OMG that's 36 years ago  when I met John I will never forget I had this crush on him all the girls in the neighborhood liked the teenage boy's not me I wanted to be around anytime I could when John was around  I was his secret STOCKER . Sometimes when I would go in to U&I I wondered did he ever know there was no time to go the minute they were open he was there when they close that's my luck anyhow Kelly was my best friend we went to private school together when I think about her she was beautiful girl I miss you Kelly I hope your well last time I heard you were in Hawaii go figure my kid's are Hawaiian. Back to U&I these are the most honest giving people I have ever met my Parent's treasured there friendship with Mr.&Mrs. Bud Long I wonder if John can figure out who I am I have to find a motor for my daughter's 2nd car I borrowed while my Subaru STi was getting serviced I had no clue the surpintine belt broke so it overheated I guess I didn't know there is so many signs when a car is hot I didn't see or smell that fishy smell I don't think it was me but that's ok I will fix it she is getting tired of her husband driving her new Jeep to work I don't blame her so John I hope you can help me find a motor for her 2003 Toyota Matrix bucket you couldn't give that car to me it is slow see you soon I will tell you who I am when I see you if anyone put's negative review's I urge the public not to believe it these people are the real deal they go out of there way for there family and friends I LOVE YOU GUY'S SEE YA SOON.</review>< resp>

<Text>Only come here because I have to or I would go elsewhere. The cashiers are rude you have to hunt someone down to get some help and the place is huge! My family lives close by and this is the only market for some distance which sucks because this Rio Ranch really needs to work on the produce they sell and customer service. A gallon of bottled water here is super expensive, you can walk a few feet and go to the Dollar spot for a gallon for 99 cents.  Although I do like that they have a water dispensing machine outside for 25 cents. Prices seem to be very high here in comparison to other markets.<//Text>< rating>

<Text>Store is gross... opened products randomly places on shelves,  trash in isles/shelves, damaged products just chillin on the displays, half drank coffee cups in the shelves in multiple isles. Went in Friday morning to get 1 can of Lechera,  then again 2 hrs later to meet my mom at the store and all the trash was still there, no worker cared to pick it up or do anything about it. 🤷‍♀️🤢< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dcb4cec969d969:0x46bdbf9eeca2ae2a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
ATTENTION: This store does not accept returns for any reason, unless a product is defective due to their error or negligence.  It doesn't matter if the product is new, in the unused and unopened package. Their reason: THEY DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC.

Here is a LIST OF STORES THAT DO:

Cardenas
El Super
La Surtidora Cash & Carry
Costco
Trader Joes's
Stater Bros.
Vons
Winco
Ralph's
Sam's Club
Walmart

Do yourself a favor and shop at a store that offers 100% satisfaction guaranteed. Rio Ranch Market DOES NOT. 👎</Review>

Last I checked English was still the primary language spoken in our country !! So apparently not in this store because this is not the first or second time at meat counter I pick a number and they only call the number out in Spanish so I can’t understand and the counter on wall that shows the number is not changed until they have helped 5 people before you !! So I left my cart full and walked out . Never had this problem at Cardenas or El Super ! Please don’t think in any way this is racial because my children are Hispanic and I love all people regardless of religion or race . It’s about customer service ✌🏻< /review>

We bought 3 lbs of shrimp ceviche, 5 minutes later we got home we about to eat it and it smelled horribly spoiled!!! We called them to let them know and we ask if we can come back and return it. So we came back and returned it but they not offer a store credit and manager told us we have to use it now while we at store.we don’t have a choice even though we don’t need to get anything we end up getting something.and the guy manager did not even say sorry or apologize to us.its like nothing happens.i should’ve called the health department on this store and call the corporate store to complain about this manager. This guy manager don’t care about the costumer, he not cares about going to work and go home and get paid.low class attitude.i still go to this store coz it close by me.and I always see that ****head manager every time I go here.wonder how he bacame a manager with the kind of attitude he have.👎🏼</review>

Zero customer service. I would like to give them no stars! Will never set foot in this store again. Went for literally just 2 items and am new to the area so I tried to stop someone, anyone to ask for help but got brushed off and avoided!< /text>

<rate>3<//rate><Text>It's OK but the bakery staff seem bothered by your existence if you approach the counter. I stopped ordering pizzas here because it's such a hassle. They don't answer the phone to take an order and give you this exaggerated wait time when you finally order a pizza, even when you're the only one ordering. So they got what they wanted. Provide such a slow service until the customers stop coming. It doesn't bother them, they get paid anyway.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I enjoy shopping there. The weekly specials are pretty good. The produce can be hit or miss sometimes, but they tend to last. The bakery makes excellent cakes! The carnitas at the deli shop are pretty good. The prices are comparable to most of the other big stores.< /text>< pictures>

I looked at their weekly newspaper that comes with daily specials. I thought I would give them a try. What a great surprise! They have six different meats you can choose from and I usually get 5 of the 6 each time I go now.
I remember trying something when they first opened and I was not impressed. They are so much better now.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dcb4cec969d969:0x46bdbf9eeca2ae2a< /gmap_id><Date>1530243211922< /Date><Name>Grizzly Just Grizzly< /Name></record>

Good prices on most of the produce. When I bring my own bag I start bagging it myself and most cashiers won't help me. They leave my items sitting there waiting for me to run my credit card, then they start checking out the next customer while I  hurriedly try to bag the rest of my items.<//Text>

Your forced to by 4  or whatever the sale is of something if you want the sale price. Selection is always the 99 cent store size. Price is 3 times that. Not going back unless it's an emergency.< /text>< pics>

The food aspect of this store is not bad as the tacos and burritos are good but I wouldn't recommend their pizza as it was too gooey for me. The grocery store aspect is decent as they usually have what I'm looking for but I only go here when I dont want to travel far because things are pretty expensive in my opinion compared to stater bros or food 4 less.< /Text>

<Review>I went in there for some tacos they took 10 minutes can make me 8 tacos. I was served in a plate with aluminum foil covering when I asked for them to be placed in a styrofoam container box, I was told by management and that they weren't allowed to give those with orders because they will get in trouble and they couldn't afford it. This from a multimillion company.< /Review>< userid>

< Review>
Bad customer service cashiers don't say hello no eye contact. This day there was only 2 cashiers yes the lines where kinda long but it went fast when it was my turn there was two people behind me i put my groceries on the conveyor to be rung up and i brought my own bags (2) and the cashier bagged my groceries but then she gave me my reciept never said thank you and pushed the rest of my unbagged groceries plus the bag i brought and i told the cashier giselle i belive was her name what about my other groceries snd she said she was not obligated to bag the rest of my groceries and i was shocked so i asked her where is your sign that says that so she repeated what she said and i asked to speak to the manager by that time no one in her line and i told her why did she bag some of my groceries and not the rest if she is not obligated and her last customer bought a bag and she bagged her groceries so she got more of a pissy attitude and she started throwing my groceries in my basket and i threw them back on the conveyor and she called security and she closed her register snd then the other cashier also said there not obligated and she also started throwing my groceries in my basket to the point she pushed the basket and i was holding on the basket so it was like i was pushed snd security told her to stop it manager showed up and he said it was not there policy to deny bagging there customers groceries its all about customer service and the whole time that he was talking to me the other cashier was smiling and putting her thumbs up the rio ranch on misson never treats there customers so rude but I've noticed almost a year this store had no good customer service especially the cashiers this has happened to my husband where he had to bag his groceries.< /Review>

Over all they are good but Management has some problems. Employees who are good in dealing with public but moved to backside store jobs or fired. Regular changing of managers.</Review>

I loooove this place, once must choose what items to buy here because it has a lot of hidden deals in its shelfs but as far as bakery items and meat...... this is the right place. Not to mention it has a great kitchen serving hot freshly made food.< /Text>

<Review>Looking at the copy of the adverstisement, I was interested in some of the produce and meat that were on special.  Though I am long time resident of Inland Empire.  This is the very first time visiting the Rio Ranch Market in Southern California.  Searched on line for the store locations.  Decided to visit Fontana store on Cherry Avenue around 5:50pm.  Parking lot was clean; shopping carts collected.  First impression as I entered, the store was clean and organized.  The floor waxed and shining. Shelves were stocked, zoned and no missing labels.  All advertised items are highlighted with proper and visible signage.  Decided to go down aisle by aisle and see the quality and products carried.  Cashier greeted me and security guard was friendly and helped me loading the bags onto shopping cart.  One of better grocery shopping experiences that I had in comparison to F4L and El Super.  Fontana will be my home store from here out.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>Ordered carnitas and carne asada tacos. Slimy cilantro and dryest meat ever. Ever. Ever... Honestly meat was so close to beef jerky. I wanted to drive back. But just threw them in trash. Dont believe me. Try some yourself. Maybe i got there microwaved left over meat. Maybe youll get lucky and get fresh cilantro and meat. But beware. Thats all</text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
waited almost 30 minutes in the line because cashier had problem with checks of some woman, meantime my ice cream has melted so i went to the fridge to replace it , meantime guess what ? i've been kicked out from the line by cashier because i left my line,nobody cared that my two cases of water were still on the conveyor, ridiculous, will never shop there again.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is not possible that they ALLOW parking in front of the MAIN ENTRANCE, enter and look at the car parked in RED LINE, and when I left to do my shopping the car was STILL parked in RED LINE, that causes LONGER lines of cars

(Original)

<Text>(Translated by Google) The store is close to us and is very convenient for residents
prices are good on some things
but what does not change is the attitude of several employees today the security was in a rude way to not let us into the store because they had to close were 9:52 and they close at 10:00 the security stopped at in the middle of the door and told us that nobody was coming in after I talked to the one who picked up the carts and made very bad comments about the truth if they are not comfortable with whether I work so they are there

I came here to get my tattoo from Gabby. It was my first one. It was a smaller one that I got on my forearm. Honestly, I’m extremely happy. The experience was great. I liked their setup, cleanliness, and professionalism. This tattoo means a lot to me and I guess just seeing it on me after it was done had to be my favorite part. I’m definitely recommending Inkwell Tattoos for your next tattoo.<//text>

<text>My Sister and I had gotten matching turtle tattoos in remembrance of our Dad. Rob was hands down the best tattoo artist I have ever worked with. He is very passionate in the work that he does and the service he provides. He made us feel very comfortable and made the experience one to never forget. I love how clean the shop was as well and the care he put into the aftercare portion of the tattoos as well. I will definitley return for more work. So thankful we chose him, the turtles are beautiful💖< /text>< pictures>

<review>I looked around at a bunch of different tattoo shops around town, and this is the one that caught my eye. I got my first tattoo done here, and I am pleased to say that it was a very pleasant experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with smiles and a very relaxed environment. The staff is wonderful at communicating with customers as well. The place is also very clean.

Rob did my tattoo and did an amazing job. He explained everything he was going to do before he did it, making sure to not leave me in the dark about the process. I will definitely be coming back in the future.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Most of mine and my husbands tattoos  have been done by rob and a few by Scotty. The laid back comedic atmosphere makes for a great place to get the best tattoos you’ll ever get! Don’t be shy go these guys for great art and a great time! (All the guys are great btw)< /review></record>

<text>I always highly recommend Rob to friends/family for bold, clean, STRAIGHT line work. Got my first tattoo from him in Sept 17, a half sleeve with some corrective work of a piece that I already had, finished it up this year, and got in for their 4/20 sale this year for my first color tattoo! Love the art I wear and I’m always getting compliments! The shop is always CLEAN and staff is super cool too. Bold will hold. 👍🏼< /text>< Rating>

Juan is absolutely amazing with his work and is super cool to talk to. He is always flexible with fitting in appointments and has some beautiful original pieces. He has done pretty much all of my wife’s tattoos and has done 4 of mine, all of which are my favorite ones. Everything healed great and the color has stayed extremely well. He gets pieces done efficiently, never taking too much time but always paying attention to every detail and never overcharges for his work. I’ve followed Juan wherever he goes and I will continue to do so no matter what.</Review>

If you want a tattoo go see Juan!! He’s done 5 pieces on me and has done 4 pieces on my husband. He does amazing work, he gives you an opinion if you ask for it. He makes sure you are 100% happy before starting. What I like the most is you don’t have to wait too long to get in his chair especially when he’s excited about a piece. His work speaks for itself, go check him out you won’t be disappointed!!< /review>

Definitely need to visit Juan!  He has done two cover ups for me.  He does a great job a packing in color.  Lines are smooth and when he is doing script practically perfection.  He did a 6 hour tattoo on my husband as well.  All tattoos healed nice. Obviously I’d recommend him because we’ve used his talent multiple times!< /Text>

Rob is absolutely amazing! I have searched for the right place for years and never felt as comfortable as I do with Rob and the artist at Inkwell. Rob took my inspiration and really brought it to life and made changes that suited me, my personality and I am so proud of the work he did for me. I cannot say thank you enough nor can I wait to get in for my next piece of art...</review>

I was tattooed by Rob "Brown Guy". I had been watching his sessions and absolutely loved his work. My husband passed away after a long battle with cancer and I wanted to memorialize Mario somehow. So I messaged Rob and gave him an idea of what I wanted. Within the week he had the start of what would become exactly what I wanted and more then I knew. I went for the appointment and the finished artwork was so want I wanted that I got teary. Rob had added special meanings within the tattoo that meant more to me then I think he realized. The shop is super clean and I felt so comfortable with him. I was very nervous since my 1st tatoo was not professionally done. Rob has a very light hand which I appreciated so much. I have recommended INKWELL TATTOO to many of my friends and they have been just as happy as me with his work. He's not just a tattooist but he's an artist in every sense of the word. I will be going back very soon.<//text>

I got my first tattoo with Juan I’m really
Picky with the style of roses but his is the best. My boyfriend also went and got a guardian angel and the detail is crazy. Definitely recommend.</Review>

<Text>This place is great, I've been going to Scotty since before he started working at Inkwell and this place kicks the other tattoo shops a**, not only because of the quality and the variety of styles these guys offer from realism to old-school, new traditional you name it they will pull it off.  The ambience and the kick back mood makes you want to come back for more the owner Rob" brownguy" is awesome, he's been in the industry for years and Juan pulls off some beautiful portrait/realism tattoos. These guys are very professional they know what they are doing they make you feel at home.<//Text>< pictures>

Two years ago I never would have gotten a tattoo. April, I got my first. This shop is the go to. They’re knowledgeable, they’re friendly, they really work with you to get you a tattoo that will last your lifetime, and beyond. The shop is full of work and a great environment for everyone fo all comfortability with tattoos from full body to a first time customer. You will want to come back!<//Text>

My wife and i literally walked into this hole in the wall and let me tell you...we do not regret it one bit.

Rob, Scotty and Juan were all super friendly, expierenced and professional .
The shop is clean and the music volume is just right.

My wife got a free hand tat by Scotty and he even touched up some spots on another tat she had gotten by another artist.

Rob did a few pieces for myself and honestly I think I found my "artist"

All in all solid work all around.
Will be going back for further art.< /review>

Im an artist and i choose and trust Rob to do my work...he has a lot of knowledge ,skill ,love for what he does and most important respect ....his shop is always clean ,the way he sets up is very sanitary .....he puts love in what he does , he is not like a lot of artist who are just trying to make a quick buck (trust me i seen a lot of it ) he will meet with you and design something one of a kind for you  ..always makes you feel welcome and wanting to come back ....Rob is the only person i trust to tattoo my head ( last one i got was a name on the left side of my head ,BIG) i dint even look at it when he drew it ...thats how much trust i have in his skill and reputation

Had my first tattoo done about a little over a year by @Juanpatt (ig) & I love it 😍 My beautiful rose tattoo hasn’t faded, it’s still colorful as the first day I got it. Tattoo artist @Juanpatt really has talent. Not to mention I drove 3hrs after I followed his work for over a year as well. Still to this day I recommend him even if he’s 3hrs away, totally worth it. Planning to go back for my birthday 😁👌< /Text>

Pumps keep disconnecting early for some reason. Makes it difficult to know if you're full or the pump just jumped. Have left not full multiple times as a result. Also staff is not great at managing traffic. There might be a mostly empty pump and then a pump with a huge line and some staff members help distribute, others just chill there, letting the traffic build up, not doing anything, with a mostly empty set of pumps which the traffic can't see. Frustrating to watch. But prices are good. Wait times can be long ...in part due to the bad pumps and lazy employees (Some! Some are doing a great job managing traffic)</text>

This Costco gas station gets crowded in the middle of the day and late afternoon (like any Costco gas station). Expect to wait about 10-15 mins before reaching the pump. Otherwise it's clean and the prices are hard to beat. They provide two choice for grade: regular or premium. You need a membership to purchase gas here.< /text>

<Text>If you don't have a Cost Co card, your wasting money. Gasoline is going up but CostCo offers some of the best savings. These savings off set the membership fee and you come out a winner. I bought a computer at a savings of over $200.00 the membership fee is $50.00 they pay you at the end of the year a percentage of your purchases. So you get the savings and money back, win win.< /Text>< pics>

Oh boy is the line long. You have have wait a long time at peak hours. Although the prices are cheap, it's not very good gas because my gas mileage isn't the most efficient. I recommend safeway gas. Little to no line and my cars gas mpg is high after filling up.</review>

The Arco at Howe & El Camino is usually the cheapest than everyone else, except Costco, which several cents less per gallon.  But, today, Costco was a full 20 cents cheapest, at $3.799 for regular!< /review>

The Costco gas near Arden is the busiest. Thankfully they have someone directing cars & keeping lanes moving.</text>

I recently decided to start getting gas here. The lines can be long at times but they do move along pretty quickly if the person at the pump knows what they're doing. 😅 not everyone does and it just holds up everything. I really do like that the employees are constantly monitoring the pumps to help the people who don't know what their doing as well as preventing skimmers to be placed<//text>

It's a costco gasoline. Google Maps asked me to write a review about it so here it is. It's decent. It's not horrible, but it's not lovable either. It's a gas station, what do you expect me to write a review about Google?<//text>

Quality gas is the cheapest. Lines move fast because they are organized.  They wipe the pumps down after each use.

< Review>
This is a great place to stop on the way up to Tahoe to fuel up before you get stuck in traffic on the way up to go skiing. This place is crazy crowded and I am surprised they have not installed an extra set of pumps for all the islands. Our Costco at home has doubled up the number of pumps making the lines go that much faster.
I will keep coming back here because it’s very convenient and close to the freeway on the way up to Tahoe but it does not make for a pleasant stop over. There is a Starbucks in the same shopping center so it helps to stop there as well for a bite to eat and a little caffeine.< /Review>

<Review>I probably shouldn't spill the beans on this, but if you go before 8:45 AM on a weekday, there's virtually never a line, since everyone seems to stop in the evening on their way home from work leaving downtown. I run through Quick Quack (conveniently located in the same parking lot!) for a car wash, and then Costco for gas, every Tuesday morning. Super easy and fast!!< /Review>< Time>

Great prices as usual but not a fan of this location. Pumps are often out of service and the lines are ridiculously long and holds up traffic in the surrounding area.<//Text>

Best price of gas at the moment. I dont think you can find anywhere cheaper in Sacramento area.
We drive a bmw X3, always go for the premium gas and it works great so far.<//text>

One of the cheapest high quality gas stations in the area - as evidenced by the constant lines that are at least 4 deep at all hours of the day. They recently started accepting credit cards! Long hoses allow filling up from either side of the vehicle. An attendant is available during regular business hours to help and will pump gas for those that have disabilities. I think the lines have been a little shorter since they remodeled the lot and put in the Quick Quack, but it's difficult to determine the long-term effects.</text>

Best price in town, and If you get a Costco Visa card, you get another 4% rebate. Sometimes lines are 2 or 3 deep, but it moves along pretty fast.</text>

Good gas price, most of the time there is a long wait.  Poor site design, had to wait in the street for few minutes before able to pull on site in to a line.<//text>

Long lines, cheaper gas (most times), but what else can you expect. It's like knowing it's rush hour and complaining about traffic. Just don't complain or go somewhere else if you're impatient.</review>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Usually cheaper than anything else but Arco ... Still I prefer pouring Kirkland over Arco any day....But amongst other Costco's in the area this one is the most expensive....for cheaper I always fill at the Stockton one if I'm around there....

Location sucks for not having Diesel as any other Costco in NorCal DOES!...  It also has the oldest machines... my card doesn't get read now and then...

Now with the new quick quack behind ...traffic has gotten hectic... So u gotta be super careful for people going the wrong way out.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Pro: cheap by 2 cents than any cheapest gas station in town
Cons: get your pillow ready for a nap, long waiting busy most of the time. can't use any credit card only F American Express
Not 24/7, Sun 7:30 am and not open yet.<//Review>
