Loved the work that Myo did on my nails. The design was perfect and exceeded my expectations as always. I have missed coming here since the start of the pandemic but I’m glad to be back.<//review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>(Update because the recently changed their prices) If you are thorough like me, you can easily spend between $100-$150 per visit. A good pedicure is about $40. They charge for everything: reshape, cuticles, size change, take off, fix, any special color requests, etc.

Best nail shop in San Jose. They can do a variety of nails and usually have amazing customer service. Only downside is they can be extremely busy. Not all nail techs have the same skills so be sure to tell the receptionist exactly what you want.</Review><user_id>103884797678597862081<//user_id><username>Tra Shawn<//username>< Rating>

<review>Very average. All staff works like machine. Actually looks like a factory when you sit there. Service is okay.
Cash only otherwise they have ATM machine inside that charges few extra dollars.
My pedicure nail paint want done properly. And my hand nails started chipping in one week.<//review>< date>

<text>Seems to be a really busy place and seeing the satisfied looks on all customers getting their nails done.

However, I am confused about their ONLY CASH policy. Is that even legal?

Why does any business in this era needs to adopt such policies?

The only conclusion I can arrive at is that they are avoiding TAXES big time.</text><Gmap_id>0x808fce9688beb321:0x88933ac8bfebeac7<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Best place to get your nails done! They can do any design you ask for. They don't rush and they take their time to make sure your nails are perfect the way you want it to be! Look on my Instagram for more of their work, they're the only place I go to! @viet_nascar< /text>

Got the worst nails ever. Miki who did my nails was in super rush - gave me cuts in 4 fingers while doing nails. And didn’t even apologize.Watch out girls don’t go. It’s so unhygienic and not safe when  you use the same brush, nail paint and everything which you have used on someone who bleed 🩸. Scary</text>

I come here somewhat frequently and the customer service has never been the reason I go here because it’s mediocre but I really appreciate their work. However the last time I was there for the services: pedicure & new acrylic set I was treated very poorly. The lady who did my manicure was very aggressive to the point where she filed my skin instead of my nail and my finger bled, she did not apologize instead she gave me an attitude when I then asked her to shape my nails how I asked and to be less aggressive. She also proceeded to hold my fingers in very uncomfortable and awkward positions to the point where my fingers were cracking. Ultimately I was really disappointed because I enjoy their work but I would not recommend this place anymore and certainly won’t be back.</text>

I really appreciate that this place is clean and I'm always able to make an appointment during lunchtime on the weekdays. They are also reasonably priced. The only thing is that the last time I went, one of my gel nails chipped within 2 days. Doesn't always happen though so maybe it's a one time thing.<//Review>

This time I got the Signature Combo (mani pedi) from Ana and Kim and am so pleased with my experience. The place is clean, professional and they have the best selection of colors.

<review>I go here at least once a month. I don't have a regular person I go to, but I had experience with  many different employees that do my nails with great results.i never had a bad experience here. The place is always packed so the best time to go is right when they open if you want to do a walk in. If you go later in the day, you better call a few hours ahead to get reservations. It gets really packed and sometimes you have to wait 20 minutes or more for your turn if you do a late walk in. The most recent time I went, I got red and champagne glitter gel on my natural nails and had them filed oval shaped. It looks pretty cool! I do recommend trying this place out, but be sure to bring cash! This is a cash only place!< /review></record></dataset><record>

We made an appointment for Minh for our wedding day and the appt could not be found. However the staff acted fast to have someone else take care of us and the treatment was incredible. This place is cash only and if you speak English there is a language barrier.< /Review>

This nail salon is BIG! I went on a Saturday at 2.30pm and all the ladies were busy but I had an appointment so I didn’t have to wait to get seated. The downside is that when I told the lady I was getting the “original”=simplest mani-pedi she looked upset because I didn’t get the more expensive service. Also she made me pay for the manicure before we even started... Overall it was an OK experience.<//review>

I wish they handed out champagne here because they hand you a menu list of pedicures and manicures to choose from which include massages or scrubs and so many other additives. My toes came out really nice and I def enjoyed the work done for my pedicure. A little pricier than your average nail salon because you can choose from a range of different options depending on what else you want done. 4-stars because it’s cash only. Make sure to bring cash! They def do a great job and have the massage chairs while u get a pedicure. They’re pretty basic but always nice to have. They’re pretty busy on Saturdays.</review>

< Review>
I always get a basic mani before doing any kind other services at any nail salon so that I can observe the technicians habits, cleaniness, and general service.

Queenie's is known for nail art and there is definitely not denying it's really well done and beautiful. They do gel, acrylic, and shellac. Also even on a weekday (Wends.) they had at least 20 technicians on hand who mostly were all busy with a customer. So definitely make an appointment if you can or expect to be waiting a while.

My techs name was Evan and she was nice but mostly stayed focused on my mani which is always a +. The only thing that threw me was how dirty her nails where :( and it's not the typical nail polish under the nails kind of messy that is common with nail techs. Hers we're actually dirty and it was really off putting. The only saving grace was that Queenie's overall is a 100% on cleaniness from what I observed (each customer gets their own sanitized tool pack and files, pedi stations were cleaned out properly after each use). But basically since all the tools she was using were clean it didn't bother me too much plus what would I say?

Cuticle work and nail filing was good but she didn't ask me what shape I wanted for my nails and automatically did square which was fine but I wish I had been asked. The other not such a big deal but still I wish I had been given the option is nail color choice. I was given 1 pallette of colors to choose from and while it was a variety the customer next to me got 3 different color pallette options however this might have to do with type of service given I was doing a basic mani while most do gel, shellac, or acrylics.

Quality of work so far is quite good. My nails are going strong 3 days later with regular use (dishes, typing, gym, etc).

I paid $25 for the elite mani which comes with collogen gloves, massage, and the other basic services.

*NOTE: CASH ONLY*

So not a perfect experience but nothing serious. I would definitely go back and try out more services.</Review>

I made an appointment for my first visit ever.  When I walked in,  I was shocked at how packed it was. I just knew my appointment time wouldn't be upheld. I was wrong! Amy came and got me just as soon as I sat down. She did a great job and was soooooo fast! The price for a full set was super reasonable too! I was so happy! I'll be coming back when I'm in town!</review>

I always come here. You can reserve online easily, or you can walk in (but you eventually might want a specific nail tech, and you aren't likely to get them without a reservation) I usually get queenie for my nail art, sometimes myolie if it is less complicated. Prices are reasonable imo and they even accept five star to collect points!<//Text>

Love, love, love Queenie's I'm so glad I found this place! Tiffany is my girl, she always does a phenomenal job. I like my nails to look thin (as if my own) and she manages to always do it without compromising the strength of the acrylic people are always in disbelief the it's not my nail, mwahaha but, that's  Tiffany's magic.<//Review>

Worst manicure I've ever had, hands down. I was terribly disappointed as I only treat myself to a gel manicure once in a while. Simply no care went into this manicure at all. Won't be going back.

There was sloppy polish dried under my nails that I was digging out for days after. Manicurist (Jenny) cut some of my stuck skin free from the dried polish with scissors part way through applying the gel so I had blunt, straight cut sections on my nails that started to peel the next day because there was an inadequate amount of polish on the edges after she cut it.

Filing was not even and the shape varied on each nail. I had to ask her to fix some of it and even then it didn't look great.< /text>

<review>Hands down the best nail shop I've ever been to. Clean and aesthetically pleasing. Jenny always helps me get the look I'm going for and I always get tons of compliments on my nails after a visit to Queenies. Pricing is decent for the work they do plus they have a reward program that allows you to earn free pedis! I've redeemed 3 times already. Heads up they are *CASH ONLY*< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>7/7/16-I was very happy with my nails and the service, but I am very very disappointed in the way Queenies handled their business regarding payment.  Payment is now cash only.  They did not convey this to me or other customers in the salon and we were all surprised by this. This tells you what they think about their customers! They conveniently have an ATM in the back and of course there is a service fee to use it!  Had I been told that it was cash only, I would have stopped at my own ATM.  I told The staff up front several times as I was leaving that when customers are making appointments, they have to let them know that they only take cash.  It also should be noted on this page.  On my way out, there was a small sign hand written "Cash only."  This was very disappointing.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Great location, near Pho mai & Target on Landess. 1st time going to this place because it was for my girl's wedding #HappilyEverAspiras first impression walking in was WOW! Place looked high end. Didn't make an appointment place was packed, they had a lot of employees each all busy taking care of customers, but my daughter & I didn't wait long. We both mani & pedis but I can't remember the names of the workers that helped her, Myolie did my pedi & she was great, cleaned the dirty things up reaaaall good & when another worker wasn't quite understanding of a customer's request she would kindly help. For my nails I went with an almond shape full set & Simon took care of me. My nails turned out great even my husband thought they looked nice. Quality is CLEAN! & he did them just like I like them. The shop looks great, didn't take too long, I like that they had a lot of workers to accommodate everyone, & they've got this cool system for points to earn & at the end I was expecting an expensive total but it wasn't pricey at all. Definitely going to try & make this the only place I get my nails done at. I heard they do champagne for special occasions but I don't drink..</Review>< pics>

< Review>
WORST WAX EVER
I went to queenie's to have my legs waxed and it turned out to be a mistake. The same day, I already had hair that were still sticking out. After 3days of waxing my hair were all back, and I am not really hairy. The service was not what I expected, and after a week I already have spiky stubble on my legs and for the money paid this is unacceptable.<//Review>

They value their customers and the quality of their work very highly - I broke a nail and came back, and they fixed it for free. Queenie works there herself and makes herself available to customers to ensure great quality!< /text>

I see Trang every 3 weeks for dip powder! The technique she uses allows my nails to stay strong and doesn’t lift! I get compliments on my nails all the time.

I highly recommend TRANG!!!</Text>

<review>Consider the following:
My wife and I have been coming here for the past decade.
I bring everyone that comes to visit me here to demonstrate San Diego Mexican food.
I brought my brother here once, and he recently asked me to bring him a burrito from this shop. He lives 500 miles away.

The quality of the food is beyond reproach, and has been for 10 years. I recommend the surf and turf burritos, the surf and turf fries, the shrimp tacos, and everything else on the menu. When you go in, grab a cup of the water out of the jug to the left. Its amazing.< /review>< resp>

< Review>
Their prices are reasonable, they're in a central location which makes it the perfect place to grab something to eat while you're in PB after hours. They don't sell water I guess and you have to pour your own water out of a Gatorade keg. They don't offer you salsa to go but you are also more than welcome to package some up for yourself. The staff are nice, they're just what you want out of a Mexican restaurant in the evening @ pacific beach.</Review>

< Review>
The woman who works the counter is very rude when answering the phone and always closes the place early. Called at 830 one night, was put on hold for ten minutes, no one came back to the phone. Went to the restaurant and by 840 they were already shut down for the night. They weren't supposed to close until 9. Horrible customer service from that woman.<//Review>

Great food all the time, I always come for mini tacos on Tuesday and would more if it fit the schedule. Great service and employees have such a nice heart that they kept my lost wallet for a week even though it had $300 in cash. I couldn't be more thankful and happy their around now.<//Review>

Burritos are off the charts good. Delicious food. Cozy atmosphere. Easy to get to. The carne asada burrito was delicious and the breakfast burrito with ham and eggs hit the spot. We’ll be back for more after-surf burrito deliciousness!<//Review>

Not sure if is this is under the same owner as the spot in Pacific Beach, but this place definitely does NOT do the $3.99 or $4.99 breakfast burrito. Just came in at 9am on a Saturday and it was $8.99 for the hashbrown breakfast burrito. And for $9, definitely not worth it< /text>

<Review>They are open late and the food is good. The staff was friendly, I left something in the restaurant and they keep it safe for me until I could pick it up. A lot of people from the surrounding clubs tend to go there. So, it does get really busy as more people start to leave the clubs and bars.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Ordered the saddest excuse for a breakfast burrito last night from these guys, the thing fell apart within 2 bites and  I just found a hair in it this morning! Piss poor service, don’t even try to make your food decent and apparently unsanitary. Just walk to Rigoberto’s, they’re better anyways. Also if it says open until 10, you don’t close 20 minutes early because you’re tired of being at work.< /Review></record>

$4.99 breakfast burritos from 8 am - 11 am every day?  Sign me up. Service was fast and friendly. But seriously?  You’re here for said breakfast burritos. I got the Grande, double-wrapped which was neither grande nor double wrapped. My compadres bought the steak & bacon breakfast burrito, which looked mighty fine. So, tomorrow (yeah, I’m going back) that’ll be my choice. Sauces were good, too.</Review>

I have been 3 times since moving to be PB (1 Month total). This place is great and the staff are friendly, honest, and accomedating. Food is clean, tasty, and well prepared for an awesome price. Parking is a challenge, but since when is parking not a challenge in Pacific Beach? Ha ha

1st Time: Fish Burrito
2nd Time: California Burrito
3rd Time: Brrakfast Burrito

I know these are a lot of burritos but I can assure if these are awesome then their various platos are awesome, too< /Review>

<Review>Used to come here all the time. We preferred it to Vallarta down the street. But the last few times we have come they’ve been closed. Tonight was 11 minutes early, the previous time was 17 minutes early. My husband and I both work in food, and know how frustrating closing can be. However, closing early and sitting in back talking with all the lights still on is utter BS.</Review>< rate>

To note is a particularly unique shrimp burrito. Almost a sealed shrimp fajita, lacking beans, lacking rice. Grilled shrimp, onion, tomato, and sour cream. A thick, saucy vegetable-and-shrimp burrito that heavily delivers its wares and is deceptively - yet gratuitously- filling.< /text>

Stopped while driving by because it looked like a legit, small time taco place. Glad I did because they were doing $.99 Tuesday TJ street tacos. Generous helpings of meat and guacamole, no rice or bean filler. Good corn tortillas. Carne asada was cooked just right, where it's still tender but has a little crispy-ness to the outside. Chips were warm and fresh, salsa was good. Will be going back.</text>

(Translated by Google) Today I went to Cotijas, I asked for a bacon, just cream potato and cheese, and I asked the cashier to please that if they could give me the non-golden bacon and I said yes
Already when he gave me the order the bacon was super golden paresis chicharron 😔😔😔
I told him he heard it asked that the bacon was not so golden and I said sorry the bacon is already golden brown if you like we can change the donkey for one of meat potato cheese and cream and I said yes and when he gave it to me Dad was super cold like you just took the dacron from the refrigerator and just threw it on the iron 😔😔😔😔 they didn't let it get hot 😔😔😔 I had to throw the burrito because I was embarrassed to tell them that my order was wrong and I wanted to avoid they'll bother me better, throw the order and I got out
I went to that taco shop very often, I will not go, the food is no longer good

Best shrimp taco of my life.
Friendly service, reasonable prices, incendiary salsas. “Spicy” = hot. Remember that.< /Review>

<Review>Great lunch. Service was great and the food was tasty and hot.
It is a pleasant surprise to get a quality meal in a small town.
Hopefully they get the support to keep it going.</Review>< date>

<rate>1</rate><text>They might have good food But I never found out.   I know that sometimes (bad) Mexican restaurants try to charge a A little bit more to non-Mexicans but  his attempt to  charge me a little more was blatant and insulting.
His menu clearly states the tacos are two dollars . I ordered two tacos and turned down his offer for a drink. I guess that wasn’t enough for him because he charged me $6.73. When I asked him about it he stammered and gave me a song and dance but  he did not apologize for his math error nor did he try to correct it. Instead he just told me that was MY price .
To me it’s not about the money the two dollars don’t matter that much to me what matters is that this little restaurant has gotten good at just charging people just a little bit more here in there than what’s on the menu. This is a very bad habit and usually the sign of a restaurant that’s in trouble.
This was my experience I decided not to do business with  them.
If you decide to my suggestion is take your calculator<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Good food, a gem in the wilderness. Literally I have drove past here for a thousand times, feeling hungry, and never stop, and now I regret it.

I walked in thinking they just sold Mexican food---but boyyyeee was I shocked! They had the best oven pizza🍕 I have ever tasted in an affordable price. So don't let the sign out front fool ya--The atmosphere is very family-friendly, cozy and mostly locals. Check it out Princeton, CA. Can't miss it! 👍< /Review>

<Review>The food isn’t bad, but the owner definitely doesn’t know what personal space means. I worked at the restaurant on and off, from the first day to the last he tried to hook up with me he would say things he shouldn’t be saying to his employees, I quit and I applied for another job they called Ivon for a  recommendation, and he told them I was to much drama I got sick a lot and when I would quit I never would give a noticed.he also forgot to mention that he text the girl that got me the job to tell her I was better looking and he was happy I was their. But he failed to mention that he tried hooking up with me, and other girls who work with him. He also fails to mention that if he called and  you were not available to work he would never call you to work again so basically he would fire you without really technically firing you. It’s sad we need a good restaurant in town just not this kind!< /Review>< gmap_id>

Amy your clearly bitter about Ivan not giving you a good recommendation, I’ve worked at El cazador for over a year and Ivan has never disrespected me or anyone for that matter! What your doing is  slandering his place of work and him! So please save your drama!<//Review>

They also have great chicken dishes, good and interesting drinks and fun staff. I always recommend this spot for people looking for a change of pace. So tasty and reasonably priced. What more could a girl ask for?</Text>

Elegant place. Dress up. Bring your partner for dancing. Bar  upstairs. Comfy couches upstairs. Great food. 2 drinks each  plus 3 course dinner for 2 will be about $175. You can go for dancing only, but limited seating upstairs, unless you reserved a dinner table. I reccomend a dinner table upstairs, because of the view of band n the ballroom is awesome. My only complaint was womens restroom upstairs. It's only 3 stalls. One wasn't working, the other one didn't lock. So basically only one. Trash on floor And no toilet paper on stalls.<//text>

This is such a cute restaurant. Service is exceptional. Portions are generous. Cocktails are tasty. And it's super romantic. It's a great place for a date night or a special occasion. Would say it's better to be a bit dressed up but doesn't seem necessary either.< /review>

This place is awesome! 10 for atmosphere, 10 for the music and the dancing, and 9 for the 3- course dinner. The food was good, just not great. The food service was ok. My husband and I went to celebrate our one year anniversary and the Cicada was a great way to do that.</Review>

This club is such a gem. So old school; a trip back in time without having to travel 88 mph in a Delorian. We went to the New Year’s Eve Eve party and danced all night to music from the 1920’s-1960’s. Big band music and all. It was marvelous and we can’t wait to go back again for Frank Sinatra night. Will keep you updated on the food when we go next time. Only downfall is drinks are a bit expensive for average drinks.<//text>

I love Korean cuisine and this cute place had amazing Yukgaekjang (spicy beef soup) and delicious kimchi. Just the right amount of spice! And I found it cute that the tables have drawers in them with napkins, chopsticks, and spoons. Clever idea!</Review>

I loved how most everyone was dressed in some period clothing fashion, but if not they were still dressed in elegant style!

The full restaurant menu is great Cali-Italian, but my one minor gripe (and a primary reason I don't eat here more frequently when they do the band nights) is the narrow prix fixe on the special club nights.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdt7SSz3pi77x1yWl_Y2Zm_KOYAxTTDpd885lu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8Oe1vKoHUEjWMKQHna7U-_DqxwovG_irH2m_x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7b4e31a2fe1:0xc5bd0edb9c8feea3</GmapID></record>

The only thing I enjoyed were the free tacos, after every drink I got they gave me a raffle ticket so I ended up with plenty and had about 8 tacos, they were bomb AF, a lot of meat, super juicy, all the fixings were on the side so I can dress it up.</Text>

This place was so elegant! The food was delicious and the  service was outstanding. The entertainment was amazing tio. They had a Frank Sinatra night and it was beautiful. The first floor had a dance floor next to the band. You have to make reservations for a table and you can sit on that table all night. There is a bar upstairs and couches if you feel like hanging out there all night if you choose to not get a table. The drinks are delish! I'm definitely coming back.< /text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Such a fun new place in the area. My dad and I wanted to try something different so we ended up here. He had the Hawaiian fried chicken and I had the shrimp in pineapple shoyu sauce. Both were delicious, paired with rice, salad and kimchee. The fried chicken was a very generous portion and everything tasted fresh. You can tell they take great pride in providing fresh, made as you order food.< /Text><time>1580814530551< /time>< gmapID>

From the outside, this place is literally a Club .  Once inside, it is a quaint, lovely oasis.  The atmosphere is cool, part indoor, part outdoor dining with a small, cute bar.  It is like being in the backyard but not in the middle of CA .<//Text>

Yes please!! We live with a 10 min walk from this place so we consider ourselves very lucky and have possibly also given up on that Keto diet cool kids are talking about, bc PASTA at La Pergoletta is sort of a little slice of true Italy, and that's better then your beach bod ;-)< /Text>

I remember the days when the Exploratorium was located at the Palace of Fine Arts. With the move to this location along the Embarcadero, I haven't had a chance to visit this new facility until recently when I went to "Exploratorium After Dark" on Thursday nights from 6-10pm.   During this time, the Exploratorium is open to Adults 18+ and serve beer and wine.  Tickets are $19.95 at the door and are first come first served to capacity.  Avoid the long lines and assure entry by buying your tickets online before 5pm and save $2 too.< /review>

This place is awesome! 10 for atmosphere, 10 for the music and the dancing, and 9 for the 3- course dinner. The food was good, just not great. The food service was ok. My husband and I went to celebrate our one year anniversary and the Cicada was a great way to do that.</text>

< Review>
Finally got around to visiting Cicada Club and it far exceeded my expectations! An evening here will run you a fair bill (dining prix fixe is $59 per person plus the $25 entry and pricey drinks) but is well worth it.  You must reserve a table and eat to have guaranteed seating, which we did - but there looked to be ample seating room with couches in the bar and lounge area.

The venue and decor are exceptional, with amazing art deco wall to wall. The dress code means that everyone will be dressed to the nines and many in vintage looks, so you'll feel truly transported to another era.

The music was amazing - it rotates but we got to see an incredible big band.  There dance performances as well, which made for a fun and lively evening (not to mention the dance floor constantly hopping with guests).

The food really surprised me. I expected it to be average because the club is so experience focused, but it was actually very good. I tried the seared scallop, almond salmon, crab linguine (special), tirimusu, chocolate cake, and apple tart as we were all sharing a bit. Everything except the chocolate cake was memorable, particularly the scallop and salmon.  The chocolate cake was the only thing that left something to be desired, mostly just a dry brownie.

Overall, Cicada Club should definitely be on your list. You'll be hard pressed to find another place where everyone there is so enthusiastic about embracing the evening and having a great time. Strongly recommend!</Review>

Do you like big bands? Do you like live music? Do you like the bygone era of the 30s, 40s, and 50s? Then Cicada Club is the place you want to be. Grab your top hat and tuxedo or your sequined dress and go have a blast. Once you walk through the doors you are swept away back in time. From the sparkling chandeliers, to the imported marble and hand carved wood pillars this place is a visual delight. There is a different band placing each weekend. And plenty of ballroom dancing. The food is outstanding and the bar is extensive. Grab your favorite somebody and treat yourself.<//Review>

I feel like I walked into the 1920s when I visited this restaurant. It is gorgeous from inside with the art-deco theme and live music with a small dance floor. They cater to vegetarians so certainly made it easier for me. The ambience is great and the food was good too. This place is great for a valentine's or anniversary date.< /Review>

<text>Went to a wedding here last night and had a great time. We had two choices for dinner which were chicken or filet mognon. I chose the filet and it was absolutely amazing. My lady got the chicken and it was out of this world as well but the filet stole the show. Place is very 1920's style with God lead everywhere and is very oldschool but very cool.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8UWCAuAykkRNot5y4UfaDQMsK4_lEvYvJBdj-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO50SI4qGpIdk2FyvN0XzmAYAjBDdxoX9jNRMEJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7b4e31a2fe1:0xc5bd0edb9c8feea3</GmapID></record>

<text>The dessert and cocktails were amazing. Would of enjoyed another cocktail. I highly recommend getting the Groupon deal for this restaurant if you can as it is pricy, but even if you don't get the deal and are looking for a nice dinner out; this place is fantastic.Best dining experience my wife and I have ever had. The staff was very friendly. Our service was exceptional. The menu was small, but in this restaurant a small menu means quality entrees.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1569613613393, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing your experience at Cicada Club.

Been 3 times already, and never disappoints! The food is A1, same for the place, beautiful architecture. A bit of a waiting line, but worth it. Recommend to go early lunch/brunch time. Vegan and vegetarian options< /text>

Lovely venue. Food was good, although personally I wouldn't say it warrants c.$45 per entree. Service was okay. Although waiter didn't seem impressed we didn't want an appetizer. Apple pasty puff pudding was the saving grace....It was fantastic!
Ambience was lacking. Our table was 7.30pm on a Friday night and only 1 other couple there. When we left there were 6 couples at tables. Overall, if prices were slightly better I might come back. But you should go on a night when there's a band for good ambience.<//text>

<text>Cicada Club is a once in a lifetime experience, and truly like taking a step back in time. Get into the spirit, dress in period attire and play along, be a 'you' as you'd be in 1929 at the height of big band and swing. Amazing place, gorgeous inside and out. no wonder it's been in so many movies and TV shows.<//text><GmapID>0x80c2c7b4e31a2fe1:0xc5bd0edb9c8feea3<//GmapID><user>100406036954299588491< /user>< pictures>

We were pleasantly surprised with the ease of checking in. The atmosphere  was elegant and the music was perfect . I even liked Tony the elevator man.
We felt we had time to dine and enjoy our meal.< /review>

My drink of choice was the "Mary Pickford" and it was delicious. My favorite part of the club is the way everyone dresses up! It was like walking into the past. If you aren't familiar with the old timey dance styles there is a second dance floor on the top floor lounge that offers a bit of privacy. The valet for the club is only $10 so we chose that as our parking option for the evening. If you haven't checked out Cicada Club make it your next weekend outing - you won't be disappointed.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Good food. Pretty exclusive. Cool history. I was only there for an event and was only offered a prefixed menu so I couldn't choose what I normally prefer.  The salmon I had was good and so was the salad. I hope to return and experience their full menu. Make sure you check if they are open because their hours change often due to special events.< /Review>

An amazing place!!! Incredible decor. Like stepping back in time. Beautiful upstairs bar. The menu is old school and phenomenal. I've paid way more for much less satisfying food. Expensive and worth every penny. A wonderful night out. A real treat!< /Text>

My wife and I went with a large group to the Cicada Club to celebrate a friend’s Birthday. We were pleasantly surprised by the vintage architecture and vibe at the club. Food was okay. It was more about the style and the jazz band. It was a great experience.<//text>

Art Deco and preserved very well! Travel back into a time when decor was every bit as important as the fine food they serve. Jacket and tie required on Night Club night. Host is very friendly and accommodating. It is very difficult to find this hotel and restaurant from the street. Just type in their address in Google Maps and park in the lot which is located directly across the street. NOT A WHEEL CHAIR FRIENDLY PLACE if you go upstairs! Cicada is a hidden gem in the middle of downtown! It's a Must See!</text>

<text>A historic building with a great atmosphere, the wait staff was excellent and very nice to us. A friend was having a private event in the upstairs lounge so we figured we would have dinner before heading to the party.

The reason for the four stars is that everything was perfect until we reached the end of the meal. The creme brûlée wasn't great and their selection of brandy was limited.

Overall, the valet was quick and the atmosphere was great. Definitely would return!</text><rate>4</rate><Date>1427546437645< /Date><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< user>

I had a great time last night at The 10th Anniversary party. Great place all around.  Especially the staff from the amazing hostess to all the wait staff. Everyone makes you feel special and important.  The food is great. I really enjoyed the vegetarian spaghetti.  Cicada has a touch of class that has been lost in these modern times.  I was very happy with my experience and am really looking forward to many more.</Review>

The night was beyond disappointing. I bought tickets and made a reservation weeks in advance for my boyfriend's birthday. We were seated at a table where one of the seats faced away from the stage and the band but when we politely asked permission to rotate the chair, they never got back to us. Our waiter, William, ignored us most of the night, avoided eye contact, and never checked on us. He seemed very eager to take our check though and have us leave, as he stopped by our table 3 times within 15 minutes after we got our bill. That was by far the most attention he gave us during the whole evening. As an avid member of the swing dancing community and a follower of the Los Angeles Art Deco Society, I would not recommend going here for any kind of special occasion or nice evening. But a big thank you to the lovely hostesses who were helpful and kind to us.< /Review>

Ok, I'll pile on... the burger was pretty good. The bun was excellent. Very fresh.

The waitress told us it was ranked as one of the top 15 burgers in the country. That seems a little far fetched. It was good but I wouldn't put it that high but that's just me.<//Review>

The ambience and venue are absolutely breathtaking - making for a wonderful girl's night. Although, it definitely would be great for date night or anniversary dinner. The food delectable, every dish description made my mouth water - will return to try more. The Fettucine Filet Mignon Ragout was amazing! Everyone loved the nine-pepper new york steak. My favorite was the cocktail list -creative, delicious and affordable. They serve the classics - Manhattan (my fav) and Sazerac - to your more creative Bee's Knees and Penicillin. Service was on point - attentive, friendly and well-timed! Valet parking is available, in addition to the pay structures in the area.</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I was shooting a wedding at the venue last year with my wife. The catering manager tripped on someone's equipment (not ours) and took it upon himself to yell at my wife even after she explained to him that it was not our equipment. I was upstairs scoping out good shooting angles when it went down. I came back to my wife crying. It took a LOT of restraint. Moral of the story is that I will never shoot there again.< /review>< pictures>

Sundays you will find Maxwell DeMille's vintage night with live band and entertainment to the jazz Era years.  The food although is a bit expensive is well worth to have! Be sure to make reservations or call ahead in case they are closed for private event the they host from private, corporate or film Hoots as well.  Most memorable scene that comes to mind is on the  "Pretty Woman"  film dinner scene.  Beside the it can be seen on numerous other films.  Bruce all mighty, and several music videos and commercials as well.<//review>< pics>

Truly magical experience! A time-capsule that takes you back to the era that F. Scott Fitzgerald invoked in "The Great Gatsby." Men dressed to the nines with their 3-piece suits and fedoras, women dressed like goddesses in their flapper dresses. What's not to love. Came through with a group of 8 for a birthday party and were very impressed with the entertainment supplied. A band ripped and rolled through a selection of jazz standards that had everyone swing-dancing and slow-dancing the night away. The bar can be a tad on the slow side concocting your drinks but other then that this place is a sure fire winner for any of those who are looking to have a classy evening on the town.<//text>

The cicada restaurant really gives everyone who visited a complete and imersive experience. The clubs art deco look, the friendly staff, the amazing band, and great food all really leand to the prohibition era experience. Everyone who visites should dress in proper 20s or 30s attire... Really completes the experience. Nice place for a group to celebrate a milestone.</text>

When you go downtown LA and you see all the old buildings, you wonder what it must have been like in the old days.  I understand for you Easterners and Europeans, 80 years ago isn't all that long ago.  But here in SoCal that was a while ago.  When you walk into Cicada you are taken back to the 20s or 30s and you see what what intricate workmanship looks like.  It's a delight to be there.  The food was good and the service terrific.  You have to stop by sometime to enjoy a complete experience of yester-year.   Oh and the music is often incredible and from the old days also.<//Text>

<userid>102191991550028128685< /userid><text>The closest Gatsby-esque moment I've experienced. Stunning ladies in their flapper attire being twirled around by gents sporting a bow-tie on a Sunday night. Live 20s band singing, playing the piano, dancing, etc. That feeling that you're in another era was priceless. Right when you walk in you wouldn't believe that this is in downtown LA.

You don't have to pay for dinner to enjoy this. Sunday nights (with cover) they'll have live music and a lounge upstairs in the back to rest your feet after hours of swing dancing.

DINNER: we got a great seat with an amazing server. It's a one table per night seating (so the table is all yours that whole night). Food was decent, the risotto was my favorite. Alcohol was ok. You're paying for the experience and the great service. Evertime we stood up to explore/take pics/dance, we saw the server refold our napkin. I've only seen people do that at club33 and CUT.

If you still want to enjoy the 20s after dinner, I recommend walking over to Varnish. They have live 1920s music as well.

R.Gadget suggested this place to my bf. Thanks Gadget!!!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7b4e31a2fe1:0xc5bd0edb9c8feea3< /Gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics><Date>1398196265978<//Date><resp>None<//resp></record>

<Review>The place was okay, the waiter didnt seem really happy that half of us ordered desserts only and the rest main course meal, the food was trash straightup , most things were frozen, the cake was hard as a brick, the prices werent even matching the actual food amount, never coming here again.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c7b4e31a2fe1:0xc5bd0edb9c8feea3< /gmap_id></record>

I went to have dinner and the food was very poor.   Service is not that good.  No Parking only valet parking - and good luck, it appeared our vehicle was not safe to leave alone in their unsecured lot.  Downtown Los Angeles is creepy.   I would not recommend this to a friend.< /Text>

Nice interior dining room with a moody 1920's vibe but the food and service didn't impress - penne pasta was uninspired and chicken was dry. May need a do-over.</Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1523845628245, 'text': "Hello Elena.  Your server did not purposefully charge you $95 as we have already discussed.  I was available and helped you in an efficient manner.  I made an exception for two people at your table to not order dinner which is the policy of our Cicada Club nights and tables.  I'm sorry for your experience."}</Resp>< review>
BAD experience, snobs, waiter was very rude, charged me $95 for dinner I did not have, I only had a drink...he was not happy that I did not order food, only drink. There were 12 of us, 10 ordered but my friend and I did not. I got bill for my $12 drink with tip included, which came to $16, and now I saw $95 charge on my credit card... Called restaurant back, there were nobody to talk to.</review>

Directly across the street from the Monterey Aquarium. The crêpes are sizable and well stuffed. The counter staff gave a complete underestimate on the size of the paninis (hands held up to indicate size of bread was about half of the final sandwich size). Service was quick but inaccurate for my special order. Expensive due to tourist area location.< /Review>

My husband and I stopped here for my Birthday lunch this weekend. Really cute restaurant with seating outside. Service was great! The friendly girl at the counter was very helpful when I couldn’t make up my mind. I chose a veggie panini on sourdough. It was sooooo good and had came with a side salad. Can’t wait to go back and try one of their sweet crepes!!!< /review>

<Review>I wanted to leave this feedback on a website, but this establishment doesn't seem to have one. We went a couple days ago. The floor is weirdly sticky, and the tables are covered with a greyish slime. The whole place needs a thorough cleaning. The food was adequate and at least relatively inexpensive. But I wouldn't eat there again if my feet were still sticking to the floor near the cash register.</Review>< Pics>

Came here on a small day trip looking to get some good crepes, and was pleasantly surprised at how DELICIOUS they were! I tried the King Zaki and from now on every time I go to  Monterey, I will DEFINITELY be getting that order. The customer service was fast and friendly. The workers were all incredibly sweet and patient if you couldn’t decide what you wanted, plus they gave great suggestions. I suggest anyone go if they’re looking for a sweet treat to eat in the Monterey area.</text>

The food was good enough. We had a savory crepe and avocado toast. However, that is the only reason why they are getting three stars. The staff were polite and welcoming, however our food was ready 7-8 minutes apart and they forgot our water (which we asked for twice). Also they use disposable plastic cups... Right next to the aquarium where they warn about those exact type of plastics.

Simple fixes?
- Manage to get the orders done at the same time.
- Have a water station where guests can get their own water.
- Reusable cups.<//text>

I leave this review because I was surprised, shocked and bemused at this establishment. Very cute shop that says crepes on cannery row, so we came in and ordered a savory crepe. 20 mins go by and the order does not come through. I'm seeing both the workers on the other side not doing much but just moving around. I finally go up to the counter to ask for my order and the server gives me this surprised look, "your order?" and looks at the receipt and says, " oh he (as in the guy making the crepes) didn't make it". I'm sorry, but what? There were like 3 people in the restaurant at the time and mine was the last order. I got my money back including the tip when I asked the order to be cancelled but really, how can you let this happen on a weekend when the area is bustling? Maybe that's why this place was not as full as the other restaurants?<//text>

<review>Stopped by for a banana,  almond and honey crepe while walking along Cannery Row.  Service was kind of slow and while the crepe was okay, I've had better. The crepe was kind of thick and reminded me more of a tortilla than a crepe. Will do in a pinch but nothing special.< /review>< pics>

<Text>We had one crepe and it was fantastic, but that was the ONLY good thing about the visit it seemed. We ordered two other sandwiches one with special instructions that were completely ignored. The food took about 10 minutes which I would expect for a place like this. If you are going to charge $45 for 2 sandwiches and a crepe at least have the service, speed, and atmosphere to match it.<//Text><date>1572214061518<//date>< username>

Surprisingly good crepes considering it's Cannery Row. however, they have committed the mortal sin of tourist restaurants on the Row: no public restroom. Fail. God help you if you want to perform basic human hygiene before you eat. You can't do it here.< /Text>

Let me just start off by saying the food here is not the issue. The food is delicious. The place is just badly run, in need of a manager and a staff who does more then just stand around. They are very nice but its teenagers being left alone to run a business. The tables were dirty, there was no utensils, the garbage was over flowing and it took forever to get our food.<//text>

I know the place just recently opened so I would like to make two suggestions. Placing stir sticks by the cream and sugar station instead of up front by the silverware.
Also having a self serve water station would be nice as well.<//Text>< Pics>

I was visiting from the east coast. It was a good Nutella crepe. It was a little crunchy. I told them I was eating in. I even tipped when I paid. They have everyone a china plate and gave me a paper plate.</text>

Longest wait ever. Even after asking, before we ordered how long it would be. Told 5 mins for a 25 min wait for a single crepe. Only one person cooking and going at glacial speed. Lady taking orders was even worse than the guy cooking.<//review>

<Text>Today, Saturday 07/06/19 I had one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life. My family and I went to Monterey for the first time and walked into the “Crepes on the row cafe” for some coffee and crepes for the kids. As I entered the store at exactly 5pm the young Caucasian cashier immediately says “we are closed.” On my way out the store another Caucasian woman entered and she did not state she was closed, instead she took her order and that customer sat and drank her coffee alongside many others who were sitting inside eating their crepes. When I witnessed that she did not refuse service to this customer I immediately entered the store once again and stated “I thought you were closed but I see you continue to take orders?” Is there a problem? Is it because I am Hispanic?”  I also stated, “Your hours of operations clearly state you are open from 8am-7pm on Saturday nights.” The young cashier who claims her name is Diana, says “this customer only wanted coffee.” I replied “I also wanted coffee, you could’ve said we are no longer making crepes but we are only serving coffee. Instead, the young Caucasian girl who claims her name is Diana says nothing ! I have NEVER in my life felt more discriminated in a business in which I entered to enjoy with my family during my vacation! Not only did she lie to me but she refused to serve me and my family. After an hour at exactly 6pm I passed by the store front and they continued to serve customers. If I could give this place NO stars I would because that is what it deserves!</Text>< pictures>

<text>I loved the show and what they are doing!! Absolutely 100%
But........ when I looked in their website at the cost of not only their services but their PRODUCTS as well... I knew that this is for the wealthy only... I am not poor but the cost is mind blowing and I was deeply saddened by this.. it’s a shame... so many good dogs won’t get this training. Just think about all the people that were forced to put their pets down because they couldn’t afford thousands of dollars for medical bills. This is training that saves lives. Lives of creatures that are so under appreciated in this world.</text>< pictures>

I have a beautiful 6yr old doggie called 'Mobberley' but being a mini schnauzer he can be very very stubborn so we watched Cali K9 and now with our motto "Always training" he is slowly and surely listening more😁😁😁😁😁Thank you Cali K9 for a fabulous and inspirational show and awesome training techniques✨✨✨✨✨✨✨<//Review>

Trainers and staff are amazing, patient, talented and loving! The dedication they have to these animals is incredible! They take the time to train not only the dog but the human as well! Thank God for all their hard work and dedication to saving dogs that would otherwise be discarded.<//text>

<Review>Excellent show, I binge watched the whole season one night! Informative dog training tips that you can implement with your dog at home. So much love and heart in the show. Go watch!< /Review></record></dataset><record>
<Text>The new Netflix show is amazing!  Gave me a different perspective on dog training. I would love to see Season 2 happen with more episodes, was way too short.

Keep up the amazing work that your doing.</Text><name>Talice Luna-Freeman</name>< Rate>

Can I leave a review just based on what I've seen with your Netflix show? I mean WOW! Jas is AMAZING! I'm in Houston, TX and our pooch is well mannered but to a fault. He's definitely not a guard dog. He loves EVERYONE. What can we do to ensure he'll alert us of strangers or intruders?<//text>

<text>I order the kit on calik9.com DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING! I’ve tried to call the store no answer I placed an email no response I purchased the $227 kit which I was extremely excited for but I only received two items and I’m missing tote , treat bag ,bandana , slip lead, long line leash, tug toy, and reward ball. It’s been 2 days since I’ve received just the training box and touch pad. I still have no track of my other items definitely a scam and I’m looking to return just the two items I received because everything else is missing. DO NOT PURCHASE NO ONE HAS REACHED OUT TO ME VERY BAD SERVICE!< /text><user_id>112919355659512930201</user_id><time>1616949623326</time>< username>

We paid for expensive training package weeks ago and still can’t get booked even though we are in San Jose. People needing training can’t wait months. No refunds. Their website store needs closed down. I’m not impressed after looking at YouTube either. My dog can’t be trusted around kids and husband is about to give away.<//text>

I can’t. Believe how helpful the show is. With 2 days my family and I were training our aussiedoodle who is a total beast to walk. We all enjoy watching the show on Netflix. I love how the show is very professional but it show humanity. That’s what we need in this world. Amazing job!❤️ The Glassmoyer family<//Text>

It's good, but a little bit hyped IMO. I think it's very distinctive at the personal protection level, but for everyday type of training- it's solid- but not stellar. Again, IMO.< /review>

They use out dated methods, have no certified professionals staff, nor do they do continued education to keep up with the industry.

Their methods will hurt your dog and they don't tell clients about fall out because that would hurt profits. Go to a real trainer instead.< /Text>

CaliK9 is a great facility and Jas has a good team of trainers (himself included obviously) that pretty much takes care of everything. I had purchased the 20/20 training package for my German Shepherd that I initially trained myself from when I got him at 11 weeks up until about 3years of age when I took him in to go with some more advanced work to certify him as a service dog and protection dog, and it's definitely worth it! Jas does great work and I really enjoyed the training, to be honest though they're not really just training your dog, they're training you to train your dog  and its all based on the dogs behavior, which is great is a pretty great tactic and it teaches you to understand your dog's behavior. My  the only reason I give 4 stars is because I feel his admin team should be more organized and stay top of tracking records or the emails they send out. I haven't finished all my training sessions nor have I heard back in over a year, but I also haven't followed up on a count of being very busy myself (bad excuse I know but life happens). Either way, if you consider wanting to get professional training, Jas has a long line of very credible work and has even trained dogs for some very famous celebrities and athlete's. I'm also very thankful for his guidance with my K9. And I'm long overdue for refreshers lol.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>My dog was leash reactive (but otherwise sweet and smart) but her behavior is now well under control after a package of 1:1 and group classes. Now she goes to daycamp and truly loves the obedience and agility work. Her favorite thing on Earth (aside from roast beef) is going to "canine school" for the day. She hasn't had any adverse reaction to other dogs since beginning her training (which we found were based totally out of fear) and is perfectly pleasant on busy streets and loud, chaotic situations. The instructors are total pros.</Text>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I've been bringing Marvin to Cali K9 for almost a year now, and he has come a long way. From a giant , rambunctious puppy, to a giant teenage dog, he's becoming a very good canine citizen.

I take advantage of all of CaliK9's available resources. I try to get Marvin in for daycamp with Frenchy at least once a week, we have a private session whenever time permits, we go to a weekly group class and i have booked Marvin for boarding when i am out of town.

The boarding here at CaliK9 is top notch. It's sad to leave your dog for 3+ days, but i have peace of mind knowing he's with the people that have trained him. He's going to get proper care while I'm gone and that makes me so happy.

You can see how much everyone at CaliK9 cares about their clients and i am so glad to be a part of this CaliK9 family.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Justin has been amazing, and we're seeing significant improvement in our puppy!

Only con I can think of is that it's difficult managing your schedule and getting a hold of them on the phone if you call their main line.

UPDATE (2018): Justin has left Cali K9 and imo he was the highlight there, we ended up not using our full package because he left.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>If you're looking for serious dog training, look no further. Winston, our Doberman Pinscher has been trained here for two years now after another training school in Sacramento gave him anxiety and fear based aggression.

Jas (the founder/owner) is passionate about Cali K9, and it shows. Everybody who works there is exceptional and we cannot recommend them enough. Winston will be moving on to protection training next year, and we could have never done it without Cali K9.</review>< pictures>

<GmapID>0x808fccc2e30a1545:0x773c4e230de6ebf3<//GmapID>< Review>
In 2011, I was a veteran dog owner, but a real dog training novice when I decided to train my elderly pit bull at Cali K9's occasional weekend classes in the Oakland Hills and Fremont. I quickly discovered there's a lot more to it than the standard "sit, stay, down" drill. Jas and his team trained me, not just my dog. And I also earned from watching other dog owners interact with their dogs in such a balanced way.

It was up to me to practice the training techniques I learned and use them consistently. This experience changed what became my last weeks with my 15-year-old best friend. Sadly, she was slowly dying of cancer and I eventually had to put her down. Around that time, I was home alone and was caught up in a scary armed home invasion robbery, which cemented my decision to re-evaluate and beef up my home security and get another canine companion.

A client of California K9 Solutions knew about a young Doberman rescue dog that needed a forever home. He was big, beautiful and friendly, but completely untrained and "all over the place". At the time, it was impossible for me to walk him down the street. Cali K9 trained me and my 95 lb. wild teenager at their facility in San Jose so I could take him anywhere. The 15 minutes of practice once or twice a day paid off and now I'm able to walk him off leash and feel confident he'll listen to me. In addition, he's turned into an amazing security dog, so I feel totally safe in my home and neighborhood. This whole experience turned into one of the best things that's ever happened to me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Jas and company!</Review>

This was my first time going to Woodland Cell Phone Repair. The staff is really friendly and the place gives out a good environment. I had a broken back glass on my iPhone X; I was expecting to leave my phone for the repair and pick it up the next day, but Carolyn did a professional repair in just a couple hours!
I also need to mention that they have really affordable prices for repairs and accessories. I really recommend this place and thank you Carolyn for fixing my phone.< /text>

Great customer service! As soon as I called I felt welcomed and appreciated, and I was given the same treatment when I walked in. The service was fast, and professional with a great price to wrap it all up. I highly recommend Woodland Cell Phone Repair for any maintenance or service you need regarding your phone.</text>

I’ve bought multiple apple devices from them and they are always super informational and give great deals, especially compared to their competitors. These ladies are focused on doing great for the community and for the people. After working with them I will never go to another cell phone shop again.

<user_name>Amanda Bowers< /user_name><text>I have been needing to get my screen fixed for so long! I was recommended this place by a coworker; they were able to see me the same day and it only took 20 minutes to fix! Their prices and customer service are way better than anywhere else I’ve been before! I also had them put a screen protector on and there were no bubbles or anything, it was perfect! They also have really cute cases and pop sockets. Definitely recommending this place to everyone I know!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1602802597278< /Date><UserId.>107540398834674379605</UserId.><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

My 92 year old mom's Doro 7050 flip phone froze up on an in-coming call. We didn't know how to unfreeze it so I brought it to Woodland Cell Phone Repair. In a few minutes, Gabriela (Gaby15gabs) showed me how to unfreeze the phone and it rebooted just fine. Thanks Gabriela!< /Review>

<text>These girls are the sweetest and have the most fair prices in town! Don't be fooled by old reviews, there is a new owner Gabby! Theyre other employees were so friendly as well. I went to her 3 year anniversary special this last Tuesday and got my phone fixed at an amazing deal! They were giving away free tacos with repairs and they were delicious! I love supporting locally owned businesses. I will definitely be back if I have any other issues!!< /text>< Pics>

Ive been to this place of business many times for cell phone repairs. I refer all of my friends and family to this business for their cell phone needs. Gaby is always really helpful and honest and will let me know whether or not its worth putting money into the repair. Ive repaired several phones with her throughout the years without ever having an issue. I highly reccomend Woodland cell phone repair for any of your cell phone needs.<//text>

<review>Went in today to get my charging port cleaned I work in a auto shop so my phone is always getting dropped and dirty so I’m no stranger to needing my charging port cleaned, the lady on the front desk informed me she could replace my charging port with a new one for not very much more and I of course said yes I also was having a problem with hearing on my phone speaker and she said there was not much she could do about it but replace it so I told her never mind. I got back after she had finished she not only changed my charging port she replaced my broken screen protector, cleaned my speaker and gave me a 90 day warranty I’m absolutely happy with the service and the customer service. Thank you so much I will be coming again.</review>< username>

Woodland Cell Phone repair has amazing service. The staff is very friendly and efficient. I took two iPhones in a 6 Plus and a 7 plus, which I thought were a complete loss, they replaced both screens and I had two fully functional phones. Besides their great service my phones were repaired in a very expedient manner! I definitely recommend Woodland Cell Phone Repair and all their services.</Text>

<Text>By Fair Best Customer Service ever!! Not only was Gaby super helpful, she's really funny. I went in expecting the worst probably thinking it was beyond point of repair. And Gaby too on the task. Returning my phone like new!! And the best part of the my experience was the price!! I was expecting to pay an arm and leg!, not with Gaby, very reasonable prices for the amount of work she had to do. All and all very Proffesional and quick turn around time. If you or anyone that you know needs phone repair highly reccomend going to Woodland CellPhone Repair. Thank you Gaby your amazing!!!</Text>< date>

Gabby and her employee were so wonderful to my boyfriend and I! We went in today due to a promo and Gabby put brand new tempered glass on our iPhone 6s, for FREE!! It was so cool that she did that and I will definitely be going to her for any repair needs!</text>

Don't take your phone here! Pay the extra money and go to a professional place. Super cheap aftermarket screens. Trust me! I took 2 phones here to get the cracked screen fixed. One screen cracked the same day it was fixed.  They tried to blame me but ended up fixing it. Once I got both phones back the screens were not responsive, there were spots where u couldn't touch at all and this was both phones. Same exact problem. I told them problem and they said that's normal and got defensive like it was my fault again.. Save your time and money and don't go here.< /Text>

I came to get my iPhone 8+ screen fixed and they fixed it quite quickly and when I got it back it had cheaper quality than it had originally (cost $140) and I pointed it out and the lady up front said its because its a 3rd party screen which I understood and she told me that if I wanted one like the one Apple has it would cost around 200+ dollars but I go to Apple and ask and they said it actually just cost 165 for and an original Apple screen so the lady completely lied to me. So don't come here. I suggest go to Apple for an extra $25 for a GOOD quality and original screen</text>

Cesar is great! He helped me fix my phone for free. He's a nice guy who actually cares about his customers and knows a lot about his phones. I had an unusual problem with my iPhone after I had the screen replaced at another place in SoCal and he helped me fix it in like ten minutes and even came in on his day off to make sure it was fixed. Thanks!! I'll definitely be recommending friends and fam to this place. It's hard to find a trustworthy phone repair place but this is it 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼</text>

They say they open at 10am but no one bothered to answer till 12! Once they finally answered they told me they don't fix charging ports. And they call themselves a cell phone repair store. What a joke.<//review>

<response>{'time': 1487134813546, 'text': "Hi Marcos, I apologize that we were not able to repair your charging port.  The community has been great to our business and we do repair about 12 charging ports a week at our location.  Not all charging ports are repairable.  Some cheaper phones do not have removable charging ports.  Some expensive Samsung Galaxy Phones sandwhich the charging port behind the lcd or between the glass and the frame which makes for a bad repair.  In theory, it is possible to repair just about everything out there but it doesn't always make sense for you to have a particular phone repaired because the cost of doing so exceeds the cost of a new phone.  I personally go out of my way to identify the best possible solution to your cell phone problem.  Sometimes that our service is just not a good fit.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nMarc Bravo\nWoodland Cell Phone Repair\n530-400-7760"}</response><gmapID>0x8084d0f2b4aea1d7:0x9865821ddbd8116e</gmapID></record>

Phone screen completely messed it up. I took it in, not only did he fix the screen and everything, he reactivated the flash on my camera. Now it works good as new, and im only down 120 vs 150 at other places. If your phone is broken, worth checking this place out.< /text>

This place repaired my iPad2 screen as promised at the price quoted. It was a reasonable price.

I would have ranked a lot higher, however, the customer service was very bad. I was told that it would be done by the end of the day and they would call me. After 2 days, I finally called, but they are closed on Fridays and I left a message. They never called back and I finally stopped in to check. My iPad was ready, but nobody ever called me. I expressed my disappointment that nobody called me; but they didn't apologize or even seem to care that I waited that long, with no communication.

A simple apology would have earned them 2 more stars.< /review>

There really is NOTHING bad you can say about Waldman Orthodontics.  From the staff, to the office, to the "patient of the day" surprises, this facility is top notch.  Most importantly, Dr. Waldman is a beyond excellent doctor.  He goes above and beyond to make sure his patients get the very best treatment.  My daughter had a complicated situation from an injury, and he led us on a very long, difficult path with patience, knowledge, kindness and understanding the entire way.  We are very grateful to everyone in the office.  I can honestly say they made the entire experience wonderful.<//Review>

I had both an excellent experience and excellent orthodontic outcome with Dr. Waldman and his team. I was told by numerous dentists and orthodontists that my bite problems (open bite) could only be corrected with surgery which would have been invasive and painful with a tough recovery and much lost time from work. As a medical professional myself, significant downtime was not something I was willing to undertake for this issue. Dr. Waldman offered me a much simpler solution with confidence (Invisalign). His treatment plan worked as he described and met all expectations. His experience with Invisalign is extensive and he can unlock its full potential. After treatment, my bite and smile are better than I could’ve imagined. The dental monitoring system which accompanies the Invisalign treatment is great so that you can see your progress along the way and helps keep you motivated.  I highly recommend Dr. Waldman and his team and if I had to make the decision over again I would do so without hesitation.< /Review>

Waldman Orthodontics is simply amazing. My daughter just finished her treatment and we will miss Dr. Waldman and his team. They are kind, fun, and helpful, and they are perfectionists -- which is what you want in an orthodontist. We cannot recommend them highly enough!<//text>

< Review>
Dr. Waldman and his team are fantastic! This was the best money I ever spent! Although his services for Invisalign are on the pricier end, it's worth every single penny to choose his facility over others. Over the course of my 16 month treatment, I probably stepped into the office about 4 times? Each appointment was always on time and concise. The use of the Dental Monitoring System allowed the team to monitor my progress from home using a VR looking box designed for your mouth, lol. By having the DM app, the team signaled when to stay on the current tray or advance onto the next set of aligners- this was especially useful during the first round of closures during of pandemic because I still had access to the care I needed from the comfort of my home. Upon re-opening, the office made sure to take every safety measure possible in order to protect both patients and staff. The office is extremely accessible by app, text, or phone which is so convenient as a working adult! My friends and family are so impressed with how quickly and beautifully my teeth have shifted. Thank you Waldman Ortho!</Review>

Waldman Orthodontics is the best! The staff are friendly, informed and work quickly to help you with any issues you may have with scheduling, financials, etc. Dr Waldman is incredible. I had a very difficult bite issue and teeth that were quickly moving in a direction they shouldn't have. Dr Waldman created a very "out of the box" approach to fixing my bite and giving me a smile I love. It was well worth the investment.</Text>

Man, you’re in GREAT HANDS!  Seeing is believing, and all I can say is... I BELIEVE 😍😍😍. My son’s teeth were scattered all over the place when we came in here, and he’s not the most responsible person to take care of his teeth, but even through all of that, he and I both screamed when his braces came off. BEAUTIFUL, STRAIGHT, EVEN TEETH! This was the most tech-savvy office I’ve ever been to. The top-of-the-line equipment.  Dr. Waksman & his lovely staff starting with Stacey...they’ve left a beautiful mark on our hearts.  My son Chase would never complain about going to this office, he was always excited! Dr. Waldman kept things interesting and his office is so intriguingly stimulating, not only for the kids, but for the parents also. Thank you guys for ALWAYS greeting us with open arms and a huge smile.  Thank you for ALWAYS making Chase feel independent and important,  we appreciate you. ❤️
Did I mention that everyone there is so beautiful? Lol. They are...inside and out.</Text>

<Review>Dr. Waldman and his team have been nothing but amazing. From our first consultation visit a couple of years ago, to our final visit in a few weeks, the first-rate service and friendly and professional staff have been consistent throughout. My son, now 14 made a great choice in selecting Dr. Waldman as his Orthodontist.< /Review><Name>Pamela Coleman</Name>< Gmap_id>

I just finished my treatment with Dr Waldman. The entire staff is friendly and professional. The office is nice, and the appointments are easy to make and change. They don’t send unnecessary emails which I appreciate a lot. I’m very pleased with my final result. Dr Waldman makes sure you are satisfied with your treatment, and will work with you until you get your desired results. He cares about his patients and delivering excellent service and work.
I chose Dr Waldman over several options I had, and I’m glad I did. I definitely recommend his practice a 100%.<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>My daughter just got her braces off!!!   Dr. Waldman is the best of the best!  My daughter had an extremely over-crowded mouth, with permanent teeth that had grown-in behind other permanent teeth.  Without hesitation, from day one, Dr. Waldman exuded confidence and competence in handling my daughter's case.  Looking at the before and after photos, one would think that Dr. Waldman would have had to extract teeth, in order to make room for straightening.  He did not!  Instead, he used his expertise to slowly, gently and conservatively move her teeth.  When we showered Dr. Waldman with praises, seeing the teeth after the removal of the braces, he was as humble as can be!  He has every right to boast about his skills, his brilliance and his impressive professionalism!  Without hesitation, we recommend Dr. Waldman for your Orthodontic needs!  You will not be disappointed !<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt9cRwRrN2CSSm4WLBz9WEJ7_q5NgZm7YSxP5N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF5ZG1ct4be4OGd0WXx5AP-slXovt60LbcxIdT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

Best. Orthodontics. Ever.  All three of my children had their orthodontics done by Dr. Waldman and so did I.. mom.  Dr. Waldman is an incredibly kind, professional, knowledgeable, and caring doctor. All of the technology is state of the art. In addition to Dr. Waldman being the finest orthodontist ever, his entire office staff and technicians are top notch. Appointment times are respected and on time. The office is clean, has great magazines, and coffee! There is no doctor or staff I have ever given a higher rating.</Review>

<Review>Dr. Waldman is the best in the business! I've had three of my children treated by him with difficult cases. In all three cases, he did an AMAZING job and their smiles are truly beautiful!

As a dental professional myself, I put a lot of research into who I could trust to do my adult invisalign. After meeting Dr. Waldman I knew I could put my complete trust in him. He is a brilliant orthodontist. In addition to his skill, his advanced technology really sets him above the rest. His use of Dental Monitoring (an app that monitors your progress from home) is next level. As a working professional, it is very difficult to go to frequent appointments. With Dental Monitoring, I only have to go into the office every 90 days. This app also ensures that you are always wearing your aligners appropriately by doing weekly check-ins and sending you personalized messages. Most importantly, a practice is only as good as it's staff. The staff at this office is unmatched. Stacey and Jessica handle anything I ever need and go above and beyond to help me. They both answer my emails at lightning speed which is so appreciated. The dental assistants Loretta and Mary are so great and very skilled in their practice. I couldn't be happier with my experience at Waldman Orthodontics. Thank you!!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b94f3cb2af65:0x85fe5d2873b55e69< /gmap_id>< user_name>

My daughter had every dental issue and then some and started seeing Dr. Waldman at around age 9. He saw her faithfully once or twice a year -- at no charge - until she was ready for braces at age 13. Two-and-a-half years later she had a gorgeous smile. We could not be more grateful for Dr. Waldman's professionalism or his patience. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</review>

<review>If I could give Dr. Waldman and his team more than 5 stars I would.  I cannot give them a higher recommendation and would send all of my friends and family to him and his amazing team.  I am an older professional, so it was very important to me to work with a team and orthodontist with expertise in adult dental work as well.  Dr. Waldman is an expert when working with adults as well as working with children and adolescents.  He was warm, professional, easy to speak with and ask questions.  He was detailed, answered all my questions, discussed multiple options, but at the same time, helped guide me and gave his expert opinion on what would work best given my cosmetic needs and dental issues.  I always felt taken care of at every visit, and my appointment was always on time. I had the privacy that I was seeking given his office set-up with semi private stations (versus other clinics where the work is done in open rows of chairs).  And in addition to Dr. Waldman being so fantastic, his who team was incredible.  They clearly communicated.  (If I gave a preference at one visit, it happened at the next without having to ask again, even if it was a different technician).  And his front office staff were beyond friendly and helpful (which is an important aspect of the clinical experience).  I have since completed my 18 months with ceramic braces and I am 100% thrilled with the results.  I cannot thank Dr. Waldman and his team enough.  It was an absolute pleasure working with them all.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I don't usually do reviews but this one has to be done.
It would not be fair if I do not let them know what an amazing job they have done, our daughter gets so many compliments on her smile that her confidence has gone up so much she is no longer afraid of smiling,
It was so easy the service is exceptional the staff is so welcoming I would highly recommend Dr. Waldman to anyone, If We could give him 10 stars we would do so.
See our results.< /review>

Dr. Waldman is  a great orthodontist!  My daughter was not an easy case, and she now has beautiful teeth.  He and his team are uber professional.  The office is managed very efficiently with appointment times that are honored.  I messed up on my end once and they tried so hard to fit me in, even though it was my mistake.  All the personnel are very courteous, especially Ashley, who has a ready smile and the most pleasant disposition.  I have had an excellent experience for the past 2 years and would highly recommend this practice.< /text>

Dr. Waldman is one of the nicest and most professional doctors I have ever encountered in my life. His primary focus is achieving great results for his clients. My daughter loves going to her appointments and so do I. His facility is modern and clean, his appointment system is automated which takes the hassle out of scheduling, no long wait times and a phenomenal staff.   Last but not least, he offers financing on treatments to which gives everyone a chance at a great smile. I'm a busy mom with various businesses and this is the first time I have ever reviewed any business good or bad.  Best orthodontist.</text>

<Review>Dr. Alex Waldman is the best and most knowledgeable orthodontist.  He is extremely insightful and can envision what treatment plan is necessary based on the individual person's characteristics.  Dr. Waldman also has a very caring nature and is able to put my kids at ease in his dental chair.  He cares deeply about achieving the best smile for everyone who walks through his door. The new offices are beautiful, modern, spotless, and a model for how every doctors office should be.  Dr. Waldman is the only orthodontist I would ever use!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I saw Dr. Waldman for second opinion; I wish I had seen him before we were so close to the end of my daughter's treatment; I had an amazing experience at the facility; Dr. Waldman is super thorough; he spent over 30 minutes with us explaining what needs to be done.  He spent all this time knowing that he would not be taking over the care of my daughter as she had only a few months left in her treatment; he explained that it would not make financial sense for me to change over to him.
Since I am a physician, I understand the costs involved in providing care; the office incurred significant cost to see us, and yet, he did not charge us as this was a FREE consultation.  I highly recommend him; he is clearly knowledgeable, has great staff, and is interested in helping people.  I wish there were words I could use to recommend him more highly; however, I will refer all my family members to him.  Thank you Dr. Waldman.< /Review>< Pics>

<date>1522370296846< /date><Rating>5< /Rating><review>Dr. Waldman and staff are professional, courteous, and great with children. By inviting them to participate in games and collecting redeemable points, the office teaches kids to be responsible for their own hygiene and wellness. Most importantly, Dr. Waldman is efficient and knowledgeable, and expertly plans for each patient's overall orthodontic strategy—explaining the pros and cons of all options over a multi-year time frame. My daughter just completed Phase One and we're excited about coming back in a couple years for Phase Two. If we could give him six stars, we would!< /review>< pictures>

Once again, another treatment completed awith Waldman orthodontics that has left us all smiling. Dr. Waldman is an orthodontist par excellence - thought out, professional and courteous. The entire staff is friendly, helpful and the atmosphere in the office is so pleasant that my children are always happy to come. One of my children in particular had a complicated case and Dr Waldman went above and beyond to provide the best solutions possible and worked closely with the oral surgeon. He is always positive and encouraging to his patients and every visit has been a pleasant one. He treats each patient individually and considers all angles. I highly recommend Dr Waldman if you’re looking for a professional orthodontist, and a great smile!< /Text>

<Text>We love Waldman Orthodontics!  My daughter looks forward to her  appointments! Dr. Waldman is an excellent Orthodontist as well as an A+ human being. The staff is fantastic as well - skilled, efficient and kind.  Maya looks forward to getting her braces off - but will miss her visits (and so will I!)
Recommend wholeheartedly!</Text><date>1447270434767< /date><userid>102661094874602157859</userid><Rating>5</Rating><resp>None<//resp>< pics>

Great office! Very helpful and organized. Dr. Waldman is an amazing orthodontist, went to many orthodontists for opinions and he seemed the best. Very nice office, and in a convincing location. Staff is very friendly, and makes you feel comfortable. Highly suggested!< /text>

<review>Dr. Waldman has treated both me and my teenage son. He has an incredible bed-side manner- very detailed in his explanations, compassionate, and respectful. He is also very knowledgeable and does an amazing job! I would recommend him as an Orthodontist to everyone!
Dr. Waldman's staff is professional and accommodating. I don't think I ever had a long wait at any appointment!< /review>< Pictures>

I met Dr. Waldman for the first time in Torrance where we discussed my daughter's orthodontics treatment.  When he opened his own office in Beverly Hills and left his Torrance office, I followed him because I had a good feeling about him and the 20 mile drive was worth it. With great tact and intelligence, Dr. Waldman delivered on his promise to fix my daughter's complex case and I was amazed at not only the appearance of my daughters teeth, but also her newly found confidence to smile without being embarrassed about her teeth.  I cannot forget the charismatic, professional, and efficient staff that helped Dr. Walman treat my daughter. I cannot thank him enough for the 4 amazing years spent under his adroit treatment.</text>

<Text>I decided as a senior to have braces.  I never had them before.  I am so happy I chose Dr. Waldman.  His professionalism and friendly office made my experience very enjoyable.  He and his staff couldn't have been nicer.  The office is easy to get to and is very pleasant.  I would highly recommend this office to anyone who is thinking of braces for themselves or their children.

Sincerely,

Dr. Waldman is one of the kindest and most caring medical professionals I've ever met. he provided expert care for my  daughter, and as a result she now has an incredibly beautiful smile and healthy teeth. Dr. Waldman and his staff were always incredibly courteous, informative and professional, putting our worries at ease and providing expert care. I highly recommend Waldman Orthodontics.</Review>

<text>This may sound a little crazy, but my daughter and I both love Waldman Orthodontics. I am just finishing invisalign treatment and Sofia (9 years old) recently got her braces. Whether you are an adult or a child, Dr. Waldman seems to know almost intuitively what you need from him. He is kind and funny and never appears rushed – and he is a brilliant orthodontist. But it’s not only Dr. Waldman who makes this place wonderful. I have been amazed by the quality of the team he has assembled. Every single person who works at this office is kind and enormously competent. In other words, Waldman Orthodontics is the best!<//text>< Rating>

<Date>1570135336528< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I was a fairly extreme case. A huge underbite, lots of crowding on the top and bottom, and I wanted it fixed (preferably without braces). Dr. Waldman, along with my maxillofacial surgeon, came up with an Invisalign-based treatment, and the results are stunning. After a lifetime of crooked teeth with an awkward jaw, I now have one of those "perfect" smiles. Through the entire process, Dr. Waldman was kind, caring, and professional. The staff was always super accommodating, especially towards a 30-something in an industry that mostly caters to tweens. I cannot recommend Waldman Orthodontics strongly enough.< /Review>< Pictures>

Both of my daughters have been through braces with Dr. Waldman.  As busy as his practice is, he knows every kid and every parent.  Everything he does is top notch.  His office is clean, organized and well run.  All of his staff are cheerful, polite, gentle and more than competent.  They communicate well and have the latest technology.  Huge patient satisfier is the appointments are ALWAYS on time.  In six or seven years we've never waited more than 5 minutes.< /text>

Dr. Waldman came highly recommended, and he has never faltered in meeting and exceeding expectations.  Always accessible, diligent and friendly, every experience with Dr. Waldman (and his staff) has been exceptional.

Dr. Waldman is the BEST! He has the best staff...super friendly and encouraging. I always feel the love whenever I walk into the office.

I had my braces on for about 18 months and it went by so fast! I would do it all over again if I had too. This experience was above and beyond what I could have imagined.

I know people think braces equal expensive (they are) but Dr. Waldman and his staff worked out a payment plan that total fit my budget! If I had known that I would have done this years ago!</Text>

<Review>I had a very complicated situation which I thought would require me to remove some teeth, but Dr. Waldman managed to pull it off miraculously with a few years and a few instruments. Getting my braces off in a few weeks and my teeth look amazing! Many thanks to Dr. Waldman and the assistants.

<user>102676053499702680947</user><review>We came to Dr. Waldman for our 2nd Childs teeth: she had a terrible cross-bite and open-bite from a love affair with her thumb. Phase one was getting her thumb out of her mouth and fixing the bite; and Dr. Waldman worked what I thought was a miracle: He felt the work was finished, as her alignment was proper, and her teeth were almost perfect. She wanted her teeth straighter, and he tried to talk us out of it, saying it really wasn't necessary. He didn't push an up-sell.

The experience of working with him and his team was delightful across the board.<//review>< pictures>

The prosthodontist does Invisalign himself, but mine was a complicated case and he wanted to make sure  I went to THE most expert in this ! Dr. Waldman had also done my son's braces over 10 years ago, with perfect results. At all times, the care that he and I received was expert, professional and very friendly by everyone --- the doctor, the techs and the office staff. Everything was fully explained ahead of time.  The prices are expensive, but competitive with the area, and there are no surprises along the way, such as hidden fees, etc.  I highly recommend Waldman Orthodontics without hesitation.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2b94f3cb2af65:0x85fe5d2873b55e69</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Waldman's office is not only our favorite dentist office it's our favorite doctors office of any kind! The office is not only incredibly organized it is the most tech savvy office; making it not only easier for me but fun for the kids! Everyone in the office could not be nicer or more helpful. Did I mention Dr. Waldman is a fascistic orthodontist?? My kids actually look forward to their appointments!</review>

I was hesitant to get braces (again) at 50. And I honestly didn't want to drive over the hill from Sherman Oaks to Beverly Hills.  It is all worth it! I have never seen a doctor's office so thoroughly professional, efficient and genuinely nice! Dr. Waldman has my absolute confidence. And it's no big deal wearing braces. : #)</Text>

<Text>I presented to Dr. Waldman with a complicated dental plan that involved a cosmetic dentist, oral surgeon and an orthodontist. This required coordinating with all of the doctors involved to figure out what to do. I just finished this 2 year dental plan and I can say with out a doubt that Dr. Waldman is professional, friendly and exceptionally knowledgable- I knew I was in good hands the minute I met him. The staff is so friendly and bend over backwards to work with your schedule. Lastly, the office is the most beautiful medical office I have ever been in. The design and architecture makes coming in a real treat. Not to mention the coffee bar! For a second time ortho patient like me, kids or anyone that needs orthodontics Dr. Waldman and staff are the folks you should choose hands down.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Very satisfied. Nice doctor and staff.  Professional.  They have free in-house xrays so you dont need to use outside facilities.  They are responsive and kind.  Updated office.  And doctors education has been in Berkley I believe, one of best schools
We were a patient for 2 years and will go in for retainers check up.
I actually find them on yelp too.  After the free professional consult I retained them and i must say he was maybe the 15th doctor I consulted.   Many in which wanted to start treatment years earlier just not to loose a patient!!!   Dr. Waldman told me to wait a year and then start.<//Text>

The office looks cool and offers ipads, wifi, and (most importantly for my little ones) free hot chocolate. The office staff is so professional, friendly, and experienced - scheduling is quick and easy. Dr. Waldman really knows what he's doing and when treatment is necessary and which type will work best. My daughter's smile is just beautiful now. We particularly liked how Dr. Waldman took a wait-and-see approach at first, while other orthodontists were recommending expanders and other unnecessary work. Not only that - Dr. Waldman didn't charge anything for the X-rays and observational visits. Of course he did eventually charge for the braces (and it's not cheap), but the payment plan and auto-payment option make it manageable and simple.  Highly recommended!!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2b94f3cb2af65:0x85fe5d2873b55e69<//gmap_id></record>

Dr. Waldman and his entire staff are top notch!  They are such "people persons" who care about and understand kids and families and everyone's concerns.

Our pediatric dentist, Dr. Nikfarjam (who is also fantastic, by the way) recommended Dr. Waldman to us.  I was skeptical because they work right down the hall from each other, and I wasn't sure I wanted to go to an orthodontist that just seemed convenient.  It turns out that Dr. Waldman is simply the best, nicest and most knowledgeable person and doctor.  (My own father was a dentist, so I can get kind of picky about who touches our teeth!)  I think he received his MD from Harvard - so he's obviously smart.  But he explains things in a way that makes sense to "common people" and he never seems rushed or that he's just trying to work through his schedule.  His associates are also wonderful, warm, knowledgeable and professional.  Although going to the orthodontist isn't everyone's favorite thing to do, my son never resisted going to see Dr. Waldman.  To me, the fact that Dr. Waldman has one of those really expensive low/no radiation 3-D scanners speaks volumes about his priorities - he spends money on equipment that won't harm kids - even if it means lower margins for him.

Most importantly, my son started out with the craziest and most crooked teeth possible - and now has beautifully straight teeth.  In fact - he just said that one of the things he likes about himself are his "nice teeth!"</text>

<review>My experience is with the manager Vicky.  I have parked in places I wasnt supposed to .  The manager has always been kind enough to text me so I wouldnt get towed.  She also has helped me on multiple occasions with my mail.  She has gone above and beyond the call of duty.  Very, very helpful.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1612997132575, 'text': 'Thanks Gordon. We believe you are right... Vicky is a sweetheart and extremely helpful.

<Name>Laura Hough Noble<//Name><date>1587572689042<//date><Rating>1</Rating><review>I’m looking for a mobile home park to live in. Just drove through Country Living and I just have one question. What country did you mean by “Country living? I noticed some construction going on, but management needs to get out of the office and start handing out some pink slips! Either clean up your space or vacate! Vehicle parts, pieces of old fencing, dead trees and shrubs, articles of clothing, filth everywhere! Also, cats running all over the place. Most of the homes need repairs to the skirts and porches. I grew up poor, but knew to keep myself and my surroundings clean. I would be embarrassed to have anyone come visit me if I lived at this park!</review>< pictures>

I've lived here 20 years, I've had no serious complaints, We are under the Rent Control ordinance , The space rent is reasonable, many improvements has been made and are beginning to be many more. Management is doing a good job. Good Clovis schools for the children.</Text>

It's rare I give 5 stars but it was well earned today everybody woz wonderfully respectful kind and considerate as well as professional. From giving me the address over the phone, text reminders, to accommodating me because there was an accident and I was running a bit late. The staff was welcoming when I got there, easygoing and easy to deal with and helpful.  The technician conducting my scans also was professional polite and cared about my comfort and getting the tests done as quickly as possible and accurately as possible and provided me a disc. At the end of the day equally important was validation for parking making the total visit quite easy. Many years ago I came here and it was not a good experience today was a complete 100% turnaround I highly recommend this location for your X-ray CT and MRI needs.< /review>

When calling there is no way to get hold of live operator. You have no idea if they validate parking or not. For x-ray appointment not required but I had to wait one hour 15 minutes to be called..  not many people were there so it was not busy. The receptionist was less than friendly but once she handed my file to a gentleman, he was helpful and apologetic. x-ray tech was ok with her communication style. By the way, they do validate parking, have lukewarm coffee and the office is clean.</Review>

I am always put at ease and 100% accommodated, whether I need a wheelchair or extra care. The facility is very clean and neat and I feel secure throughout my visit.

Great experience. Friendly staff. Covid-19 safety protocols in place.  Filled out the paperwork then I was taken to the back to change.  Comfortable gown that wraps around so you don't have to tie them or feel exposed.  Changing area with lockers and shutter doors not curtains.  A small sofa to sit and wait for them to come and get you.  Friendly techs.  When done I requested a copy of my images and the front desk put them on a CD for me.  I was also able to make my appointment online. They also had openings for an earlier day and they called to see if I wanted to do the MRI sooner.  They have a parking structure, but I parked at a parking meter.  So I can not say anything about the parking; if they charge, validate, or the cost to park their.</Text>

<review>I was sent by my Urgent care to get an ultra sound. I got an appointment on the same day but when I was on the way they called and wanted to move my appointment to another day - which was not ok with me - so I was told to be prepared waiting a while.. once there, I was waiting only 5 minutes. Ultra sound was quickly done and the staff was very comforting as I was really nervous and worried about it..
Everything was clean and well organized as well. I can recommend this place.
Thanks again.<//review>< Pics>

HIGHLY professional individuals with caring hearts. You can't see their smiles because of the mask, but their eyes let you know THEY ARE HAPPY TO BE OF SERVICE!
I've was having an MRI done today, and was genuinely concerned about the virus and being around people. I am BEYOND appreciative and impressed of the way the facility is being managed. I appreciate how kind and concerned everyone always is, and how well I was received and treated. HIGHLY RECOMMEND 😇</Text>< pics>

<Review>I was treated with upmost respect and the facility was clean. The office and rooms were spacious allowing room for spacial distancing. I liked the lockers to put my personal belongings in, with a personalized code. I was concerned about my wedding ring set, which I never remove. I had been to facilities that use a key, but I know a key is metal and would not be allowed in the MRI. I would like to have read some literature on the code before the last minute. The staff made sure my lockers were secure before I left them. I was made comfortable during the procedure and was given both ear plugs and ear phones. I was told how long the procedure would last. I was very happy with my experience.< /Review></record>

My appointment was at 12:30pm and they ask to arrive 20 minutes early and which I did. Will behold stood in line the 20 minutes early waited to be served.
The lady behind the desk was on the phone with the tech because he’s running late and he should be here shortly Will that turn our to be 1 hour  and 1/2. I had to go back up to the window to ask was I going to be seen then she reply he’s having problem with  the lady on the table.
I have never experienced this type of service from Beverly Image . Will not take no more appointment on a Saturday. Very slow service. Then afterwards ask for a copy of my report same lady said take a seat a d she would get to me. Well behold she went waiting on other patients and sat another 20 minutes. Had to go back to the desk with minutes received the CD.
Not a happy patient<//Text>

<Text>Facility and people at facility are amazing, however scheduling department was unprofessional and hard to deal with prior to my arrival. If I had a choice I would have gone somewhere else...the operators demeanor, capabilities, and overall attitude demonstrated throughout the initial phone call turned me off immediately, thankfully they are just one aspect, and the on site staff are much more accommodating and genuine...I can only imagine how many people may feel this place is not amazing because of that first interaction.

Also be sure to bring some form of photo id, they have to comply with making sure the right human and receiving that right tests!

I would give location 5 stars, scheduling 1 star.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<name>Tommy Salyers< /name><Review>I went in not knowing what to expect. My current urologist didn't take the time to explain anything. He is in the process of being replaced. However, Beverly Tower Advanced Imaging especially the technician who did the PET scan was awesome. Explained everything that was going to happen in a language I could understand. I was so comfortable that I fell asleep and must of moved my head because they had to do an extra image. I felt comfortable and cared for the entire time. I highly recommend this business especially if is the first time you are have special x-ray done. IE: MRI, CAT scan, PET scan, etc. A+ patient care.< /Review>< user_id>

Today I went to have a CT Scan at Beverly Tower Wilshire Advanced Imaging. Everyone was very friendly. I was seen in a timely fashion & both Ruben & Joe were professional and knowledgeable. The longest part about the visit was filling out paperwork. (They send it to you early, so I would advise to do it before you arrive) . 10/10 would recommend<//Text>

<review>They buy their reviews,(Who is really stupid enough to believe almost 3k people gave them a 5 star rating? This place is horrible and will try and steal from you. They will do tests that were not prescribed by your doctor and try to charge your insurance, if the insurance does not pay they charge you for it. Hopefully they will be closed down for insurance fraud. Avoid them al all costs, you will regret it.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Was going to leave 4 stars because overall the experience was pleasant. The front desk staff was a little rude, one person more than others, but the rest of the staff was great! Giving 3 stars because it’s really annoying how immediately after leaving (literally 15-20 minutes after walking out the door and getting into my car) I received a text message asking me to leave a review. Never had that happen ever after leaving any medical place, nor have I ever even been asked to leave a review. So here it is.< /Review>< Name>

As far as walk in xray appts go, this went pretty smoothly. Considering I showed up without the correct paperwork the overall visit took about an hour. The xray tech deserves a shout out for being a compassionate human being, kindness goes a long way.
They validate parking.< /text>

<Text>Everyone at Beverly Towers Advanced Imaging on Wilshire was friendly and professional. They explained everything very well. I snuck out to eat a banana (was starving) and ended up making them wait when they had come to call me in for my appointment, and they were still so nice about it when I got back.
They were up front about everything. They even provided information that the MRI contrast contained Gadolinium and graciously allowed me to opt out and have it done without contrast. They were very nice about everything.
And they validate parking! They social distanced us and I was in and out quickly. Highly recommend this group!<//Text>< user_name>

The wait time was less than 5mins from my scheduled appointment. The staff was polite and friendly. Waiting area was no problem or clustered.
My nurse and doctor was amazing. I received great pictures of my ultrasound and for the first time of my pregnancy I was able to find out the sex of my baby.

I appreciate each and every one of the staff who went the extra mile to make my visit more comfortable.

Big props to Dr. Isabelle. Wonderful job, thank you.< /Text>

I have severe anxiety and with recent events have dreaded all the scans and tests I have to have done. But after disclosing my anxiety, previous reactions to tests and what looked like reading my body language, from the receptionist to the technician the kindness was overwhelming. During the MRI, the technician reminded me of my rights and right to refusal to do anything on multiple occasions and checked in on me often. I’m so glad I came here and they made this nerve wrecking experience as comfortable as possible.<//Text>

Although I approached the office assistant responsible for a different procedure, she insisted she could still help me complete my registration and checked me in promptly. When I was taken into the exam room, I was introduced to two kind technicians. The procedure was explained thoroughly, as well as possible risks and side effects. The exam technicians were compassionate about my expected discomfort and distracted me with light conversation. If I ever have to have an HSG done again, I would only want the exceptional care these ladies offered.</Review></record>

The staff at Beverly Tower Wilshire has always been impeccable. They're attentive, friendly, and give a real feeling of self-assurance that you work to being taken care of. From the front desk staff who are very thorough and professional, the technicians who work in back and run the machines and get you ready for your procedure, they are a Class Act. I got my first MRI at Beverly Tower Wilshire almost 20 years ago and have had several there since. They have always delivered fast, confident, high-level service. The results have always served my health perfectly. They are probably the best in the country at what they do.<//Review>

<review>This facility was outstanding!
I had a PET scan this morning (the first appointment, arriving just before 6 am), and as far as scans go (and I've had them all...multiple times...due to metastatic breast cancer...so I know what I'm talking about), this was practically a spa day!
Shiran was my technician, and she couldn't have been nicer!
I was treated with kindness and respect, my needs were met, my pain and physical discomfort was considered. Even the injection wasn't so bad (and trust me, I have one arm that can't be used due to lymph node extraction, and the "good" arm has pretty fried veins from chemo). Shiran was gentle, and calm, and made me feel really comfortable while I went through the steps to prepare for the scan.
She made sure I was warm and comfortable while lying down for the scan (not the easiest since I have a lot of complications that make comfort hard to come by), and practically swaddled me like a baby.
It was up to me to just breathe, and lie as still as I could, but she made everything else quite easy.
Thank you Shiran!!!

I was called back quickly right after given paperwork. Only to find out they had the wrong patient. That administrative process was uncomfortable, lacked professionalism and made me very anxious. Especially seeing that the rep helping me with paperwork kept asking for help as to what to do and the rep being asked for help could’ve made an effort to show care instead of just glancing at my rep without ensuring proper procedures were being followed. There’s much more to this. You can contact me if you’d like to hear it< /Review>

I was incredibly disappointed with the service provided. First, I was told to walk in for my X-ray and then, when I arrived, told that walk-ins were not accepted and I had to call and make an appointment for a different day. Then, my birthdate was recorded wrong and I was billed almost $1,000 because they did not submit to my insurance correctly. Incredibly unprofessional and unnecessarily difficult for the patient!<//Review>

I was hesitant to go in and have a needed diagnostic checkup because I was worried about catching COVID. The minute I walked in, I was reassured. The seats in the waiting room were an appropriate distance apart. There were hand sanitizer machines available for our use, and despite the pandemic, my appointment went quickly, smoothly, and in a very streamlined and organized way. I got the same great service I always get from Beverly Tower facilities. And I was out of there in well under an hour! If you have to get checked for something, don't worry about going there. They've got everything well under control--or they did for me today, anyway.< /Review>

i was told to come at 4 for x-rays before my mri just to find out that they stop doing x-rays at 3:30. the appointment for my mri was at 445 but wasn’t called back until after 5:45. even after being called back, i was left waiting in a hospital gown for another 15 minutes waiting for a tech. no one ever apologized for this serve waste of time. this place lacks any consideration for your time and patience.< /text>

The people who work here were very kind to me. From the receptionist to the radiologist assistant this office was an example of how customer service should be.

I’ve been to a number of medical offices lately and I’ve noticed a bad-ittude with all of the front desk staff. This office however seems like they treat their staff right and they’re happy. What a difference.< /Review>

I arrived thirty minutes before my appointment time, I was told their would be a little delay, but I didn't really have to wait but a few minutes longer than expected and the nurse I had was so understanding she made me feel so relaxed, my doctor was just as understanding and patience with me was beautiful because I can be a grown baby when it comes to doctor appointments, THEY WERE A GOOD TEAM FOR SURE !!<//review>

Winning today to get my knees and my neck imaged I got there around 4:00 the gentleman at the front said that they normally don't take patients at that time however he was kind enough to take me in. Once I was in the imaging Center the two gentlemen were very well versed and knowledgeable about how to place my knee and neck for getting it x-rayed. Highly recommend Beverly tower to get your X-Rays done CT scans or MRI. #SeñorJulio</Text>

Charon (spelling?) was great! She made me feel very comfortable , and sat with me the whole hour and a half of my test. She answered all my questions and made the experience much more tolerable. She also has a good sense of humor, which can be a godsend when nervous about a test.

This is my 3rd time here and have always received great service.</Review>

<username>Tracee Munnerlyn<//username><Text>I called days before to my visit to make an appointment for x-rays and was told no appointment was needed and to just walk in. I arrived at open, 9am - the time told to me on the phone - only to discover at least 15 other people already waiting (I later did a search and saw that the office actually opened at 7am).

I checked in easy enough but ended up waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes before I was called. During that time I witnessed not one but TWO huge roaches crawl across the floor & die. A heroic fellow waiting patient threw them in the trash.

Staff was super friendly - especially the person who did my xrays, absolutely lovely - but wow, why can’t I make an appointment for xrays so I’m not waiting for almost 2 hours with the roaches?<//Text>< Pics>

Beverly Tower Wishire is a wonderful place. They were so kind, gentle and patient with my 80 year old mother. We went in today for a MRI of the brain and my mom is extremely claustrophobic that she usually can not complete these exams but the way the staff took care of her she was able to do the whole thing. Thank you Veronica, Moises and the kind nurse that helped with the IV for being so amazing with my mom. We left with a happy feeling and we don't get that everywhere we go. I wish everywhere could be just like Beverly Tower Wishire</Text>

The lack of service at Beverly tower Wilshire is beyond belief. Not only they gave me the wrong time for my X-ray, but they gave me attitude too. The people at the front have zero understanding of their patients time and think the world is as lazy as them.  I wonder if their m managers are as lazy as them bc I would not come back here by choice.  horrible service! Horrible management.< /Review>

<Text>Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful. The wait for a chest x-ray was two hours for first-come first-served, but I gave them my phone number and they called me when it was my turn, and they held my place in line. Can’t ask for better than that in our current health care system. Best way to completely avoid the wait is to get there at 7:30 am< /Text>< Date>

I LOVEE Beverly Tower!  I always tell my treating physician  to send me there if I need any type of radiology work done.  Ive had MRI's, Ultrasounds, x-Rays, of late, I have used their services quite frequently and also years past. Always the same, consistent , expedient and wonderful service, from the front desk to the technicians.  The techs are very kind, professional and comforting if you are the least bit nervous. Very good about appointment reminders as well. Validated parking too!</Review>

It was fine. A little noisy perhaps. But everyone was pleasant and seemed to know what they were doing.  You really can't ask for more than that nowadays.
As far as their technical expertise,  I guess only doctors would know how well they do.< /Text>

My appointment was scheduled for 8:50p, I’ve never had an appointment scheduled so late In the evening which I actually liked. The staff is extremely nice and welcoming. In particular, the gentleman that conducted my MRI. He was phenomenal! He made sure I knew every step that was taking place, explained to me how everything would go, and was just very patient and warm. He made me feel at ease and very comfortable, when in general being in tight spaces like that tube makes me extremely anxious!< /review>

Although I stood in 3 positions, my CD shows only 2 views.

I came in for an ultrasound appointment, I just had to fill out the corresponding form and I was in in less than 10 minutes. I was called and attended by a very nice and professional young lady. I sadly forgot her name but she was very kind and made me feel very comfortable. Definitely recommend this place.<//review>

I had an MRI  done at this location.  Not only was the front desk staff very sweet. But the gentleman who took me through the MRI was very Nice and helpful. He made sure I was comfortable. The machine itself is a bit intimidating but he made sure I was safe and comfortable. Thank you for making my experience pleasurable.< /Review>

<Review>Nice facility, clean and friendly workers.  However, I was left standing waiting to check in with no greeting and finally when it was my turn there was still no greeting, just what are here for and when I responded MRI, she pointined to her left and said that check in back there on the right.   Wow, I just stood there in the wrong line because there are no signs directing clients to right desk.  Very confusing.  Really how hard is it to have a sign???  Luckily the girl at the MRI check in was very welcoming and nice.< /Review>< Rating>

Everything was good and professional except for Covid considerations. Anyone could enter the waiting room and the imaging room. Temperatures were not taken and questions were not asked to find out the likelihood of the client having covid 19. People could sit anywhere,  including next to each other. Finally, before going into the MRI machine I was asked to remove my mask. What if the person before me in that MRI machine had covid 19?<//review>

The most modern, yet warm and inviting, well-appointed, state-of-the-art facility for imaging, equipped with a large MRI that quells anxiety, and the technician and staff were the most exceedingly accommodating, personable, and knowledgeable, possible. I love this place. Very alert staff.</Review>

<Review>Everything went well and the staff was polite. My only issue is that the person who I made the appt with told me to arrive 20 mins early for check, which wasn't necessary as I'd been there before. All I had to do upon arrival was sign a form, that didn't does not take 20 minutes. Since it had been years since I was last there, I couldn't remember what the parking situation was like. So I asked her and she told where to park. When I got there the parking facility was closed. I had to park on the street and walk a block and a half in the pouring rain. All this while I was in severe pain. Other than that, everything was fine. The wait was only 10 mins after my appt time, which is pretty good for any medical appt these days.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b951b65ef119:0xd6e942e1789d80be</Gmap_id><user_id>109548612906438104217</user_id></record>

My mom had an appointment for a Petscan . We were very worried no one would be able to find her veins. I want to say thank you to the man who took such care and was patient with my mother today Oct. 1. You are a compassionate and caring human who made a very tough day easier to manage. My mom has terminal cancer and doesn't have much time left and your act of kindness has touched my family in a great way. Thank you.</Review>

Actual service was really good. Tech was professional and very good at her job. Scheduling had a bit of a snafu, as they had a wrong number for me, so my first appointment got cancelled. This would’ve have been a big deal, but when I rescheduled, the number still hadn’t been fixed (I had tried to correct it in the office). Still 5 stars<//text>

I went in for a kidney ultrasound and I can’t talk enough about Alex who was the ultrasound tech.   Alex was truly awesome and amazing 👏 because he is a professional who pays attention to every detail while keeping u comfortable and relaxed during the whole procedure.  I would highly recommend Beverly Tower Wilshire and give a high rating for fast and friendly service but most importantly 5stars for having a very clean environment.<//Text>

Overall a 5. They checked me in on time. The people were very nice. I was disappointed that as the front desk person took me to the back, a worker emerged without a mask from a hallway. He quickly put it on when he saw us but he should have had it on. I would also have liked to have known if the locker keys and pens were sterilized after each use.</review>

I had a terrible experience here. The clinical staff (radiologist, rad assistant, X-ray technician) were friendly, but the 5+ people I interacted with from the scheduling department and the front office were completely incompetent. Due to several errors on their part, I had to come back THREE times in order to have my imaging done. I also did not feel comfortable with their covid precautions. They have you laying on the same board that the previous person laid on, without any protective sheet like you see in a medical office. Also, no temperature checks at the door. If restaurants can temperature check their patrons, so can an imaging center. Save hours of your life, a huge headache, frustration, and go elsewhere.</text>

As soon I arrived. Staff at front desk. Very polite. All of them wearing a 😷. Social distance in place. Ms Isabella and Christine. I hope I’m mentioning their names correctly. They were both professional. Ms Christine . She was a sweetheart. Wow I’m blessed and thankful that She was the one taking care of me. The  Place was spotless. They were ready for COVID rules. I been to other places. Beverly Tower Center. 5+.
Thank you so much for everything that you do.<//Review>

<text>I'm used to reviewing restaurants more than imaging centers , but they asked me to so here we go: parking's expensive $20 Max I found a place on the street and then lo and behold they offered to validate my parking. The waits are a little bit long so I had time to move my car and save a few bucks.
The facility is beautiful and professional. Lots of colored glass, stone and wood highlights,  very nicely done and very clean. It's something you would expect in Beverly Hills.
After checking in and getting your background paperwork done you'll need to be patient. This place is an Imaging Factory. Not in a bad way, but in an efficient and professional way. Everybody there knows what they're doing and has a job to get done. I was there for a cat-scan and had three different technicians who were all excellent and very knowledgeable about their craft. I was in and out in 10 minutes once I got to the machine and out the door in another 15 (only because I waited for my copy of the scan). If you get assigned to this center you're in good hands, it's American medicine at its best. Enjoy

Lovely staff and wonderful team of technicians/doctors who helped with my scan. I felt I was in great care at this radiology center. The staff and technicians explained everything and made me feel comfortable during my procedure.  Also very clean facilities. I could tell they cleaned it thoroughly throughout the day.< /text>

< review>
The absolute, most horrific experience I’ve ever had at an imaging center. The way the staff handled my father, a neurologically impaired individual was horrendous. He had an hour and forty five minute MRI and was offered no breaks whatsoever. When he was clearly uncomfortable and feeling overheated and overwhelmed, they did nothing to comfort him, nor tend to him. I will never return to this facility and I will be sure to advise any of my clients, friends, and family to avoid it at all costs. We will be filing with the AMA.</review>

The front desk tech who signed me in was very nice, professional, and responsive to me when I needed some help.  She was all alone with patients and paperwork and yet she maintained her composure and was helpful and courteous to everyone.

The tech who performed my ultrasound was also professional, calm (which was reassuring) and pleasant.  She made an uncomfortable procedure more tolerable.

I only dealt with these 2 women and I truly appreciate their professionalism and courtesy.</Text>

Great staff and made me feel very comfortable for my MRI. They also did a great job of spacing out the lobby and keeping everyone 6 feet a part.<//review>

I arrived about an hour early to my appointment. Please be on time!!  You must wear a face mask and stand 6 feet apart. The staff was professional and friendly. The ultrasound tech that performed my ultrasound was awesome. Overall, I was satisfied with their service.< /review>

What a great and very well organized, despite covid, business. I checked in online 24hrs ahead, today for my appointment I waited  5mins before I was gowned FOR MRI.  Waited a further 10mins while they sterlised the equipment from last client. Very professional and responsible staff, spotlessly clean, first class all the way. And they validate parking in lower level parking lot. They made a nervous client very very happy, I was out in less than 45 mins total visit! Professional and friendly staff.</text>

Wait was much longer than expected. I came 20 minute early as told and they were almost 40 minutes late, so I waited for around an hour. My technician was kind and helpful. Walked me through the procedure, offered me a blanket in case I got cold. Checked on me throughout to make sure I was okay. Overall a good experience.< /Review>

<text>I pre filled out My information online. I showed up to the appointment 10 minutes early. I waited three minutes for them to call my name. I went in to receive my MRI and x-rays. From when I  walked into the door until the moment I left, it took 50 minutes. Very pleasant staff and helpful with every question I had.

I highly recommend this facility.</text><user>112420922725236796130< /user>< Time>

It’s really leave a bad taste on my mouth and I will not going back there again<//Review>

This is the first medical facility that I have been to since the pandemic struck that does VERY VERY little in regards to precautions and safety measures. No temp taking. No hand washing. Some employees are not wearing masks properly ie. below their nose or around their necks. Overcrowded wait area!!!! Clearly they care more for money than patient care. On the other hand, the techs were lovely and professional.< /Text>

<Text>I was taken back to my MRI by a nice technician. Unfortunately, she did not explain anything about the procedure and what I could expect.  I have had several MRI and knew what to expect but had I not I would have freaked out over the noise and experience. She gave me little foam earplugs that I wouldn’t even have you Used to try to sleep in my quiet home. I honestly thought I would have hearing damage from the loudness of the machine. When I was taken out, I noticed that right there were headphones that I could have used. They really need to prepare and explain what to expect before people have that experience!</Text>< Pics>

Clinical staff is efficient and knowledgeable. Excellent treatment experience.

Would have been five stars if not for appointment delay.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Walked in without appointment and within 20 mins I was changing into a gown to get my X-ray. The X-ray took 5 minutes ! I was in and out with validated parking in less than an hour.  They have designed a very good internal system to accommodate the patients in an efficient and expeditious manner. The staff were friendly and polite.  All in a clean and comfortable atmosphere.  On top of that, they offer coffee and tea while you wait.  Couldn’t be more pleased.   And to the staff, good job! Be proud of yourselves!  Your conscientious hard work is noticed, and I thank you.<//Review>

<Review>Beverly Tower Imaging treated me with the utmost respect and care, especially during a scary moment for me in needing an MRI. I needed to be seen at night, which was very convenient especially as I work from 9-5. A 6pm appointment was great, and there were hardly any patients waiting.

The technicians who assisted me, Enrique and Raezelle were respectful, kind, courteous and patient. The gentleman who gave me my CD, Oliver was also friendly and asked me how my visit was.

I would recommend this office for any and all medical needs.<//Review>< Pics>

I went on a Tuesday evening (4:45/5pm). I was there for a walk in X-ray.  I was in and out in 15 minutes. It was the fastest experience I’ve ever had. It might have been a bit of a stretch, or I might have been lucky but it was really low traffic and they’re really quick with getting their imaging!

I would go back there for sure. Especially on a Tuesday evening.</review>

In the wake of COVID-19, seemed like all staff members were pro-active sanitizing & cleaning during my 6:40 AM apt. Extremely friendly, helpful & caring staff. Only two things I would recommend:
1) Supply “WAX EARPLUGS” for MRI Patience (or Recommend bringing your own with noise warning). The cheap foam plugs hardly muffle the incredibly loud sound at all to very sensitive ears and those with migraines that has both issues: it cranked up pain like unbelievable and ruined the day in pain And ears ringing.
2) Supply HAND SANITIZER STATIONS in various area  so everyone is protected and both staff and patients can use it.</text>

I was greeted right when I entered by a super friendly staff member. I was seen in good time and the women was again, so nice and explained to me what we need for the ultrasound. I was in and out quickly and left in a good mood. Highly recommend!</Review>

Clean, friendly location to get your imaging done. Karen is great. Thanks for all you do.

1/5/2021 Came in for a PET scan. There was a mix up with my appointment, someone didn’t call me to confirm the day before, but Amy worked with me to squeeze me in for my scan in the afternoon. The downside being I had to remain fasting until I was done with the scan and that wasn’t until 5pm. I really appreciated Amy doing all she could to accommodate me as I didn’t want to reschedule. Jimmy the tech was very personable, patient and explained the process throughly. He also welcomed suggestions for improving patient care which is really meaningful. Thank you Amy and Jimmy.<//review>

The staff was friendly and courteous. The issue was the wait time especially during Covid. When I arrived there, they told me the wait time for chest x-ray was 45 minutes. They don't do appointments for x-rays. Why??? I was finally called to go inside after 90 minutes. I waited another 15 minutes inside. It took 2 hours for a simple cxr. The waiting area was full. People came and left and no staff member did anything to sanitize the seats. I will never go back there as long as Covid is present.</Text>

<text>The staff that I came in contact with were very nice. My issue was that I had received a text from the office that said if I did not want to wait inside (the waiting room felt a bit full to me) I could wait outside and text “here” and they would let me know when they were ready for me. I waited for a while outside and then I texted 40 mins in to see how much longer and did not get an answer. Finally at an hour and twenty I called and they said the texting system was newish and some people forget to look at it. They said I should come back in an hour. So to get my MRI it took two hours of waiting. I know things are not easy right now, but don’t have a system and tell people to use it and not have staff trained to look at it!< /text>< name>

I can only give a mixed review. The technician who did the actual MRI was great. Unfortunately,  I was not given the option to fill out paperwork ahead of time which I would have done; there were way too many people waiting for appointments which were running late; I was told that temperatures would be taken which did not happen; I didn't see any one clean the chairs in the overly crowded waiting area.</text>

Very proficient and professional from the front desk to the CT scan employee. Especially the Persian lady who does the CT Scans (I can't remember her name). She was reassuring, informative and very friendly. I even gave her a pen light to express my appreciation. She stayed past the 9 pm closing time to finish up with me!!< /text>

When I arrived at the reception desk, I was greeted with a smile and quickly help. I was taken to the waiting area for my MRI by the technician, who proceeded to explain the procedure and allowed me to see the type of machine for the testing. I was put at ease after that. She had taken time to position me  for comfort. I was told the length of time each section would take. Also I needed an IV for the contrast, the other technician was experience in finding my difficult veins, great experience I had. Would request procedure done here, if ever needed again. Thanks to all the staff. Mrs. Shirley Pierfax<//text>

Easy check in. Nice staff. Nice doctor. Wish they played some music in the room because i was sitting in silence and felt awkward. Also walking the patient through the process would be helpful. I thought I was getting something simple done and it seemed to take longer than expected. I left the office feeling worried.< /text>

I arrived for my appointment, and was seen almost immediately - which was refreshing considering the wait time in some doctor's offices. The 1st procedure was done just as quickly.  The technician was professional, provided coherent instructions, and was friendly. The 2nd procedure was just as fast, and the different technician just was friendly. Beverly Tower Wilshire exceeded my expectations, and I was very happy with the whole experience.</Review>

<review>This place is honest insofar as they operate for one purpose only: to take your money.  You can't even check in until you've paid the full amount IN ADVANCE.  They don't bother checking with insurance because it's not about whether you're insured, it's just about taking your money.  They claim that "most insurance doesn't cover this," so they don't bother.  Just hand them your credit card because that's all this is about.  I had to hand-write-in my insurance info because as far as they were concerned, it didn't matter.  Well, it does matter.  I have insurance for exactly this kind of thing.

Whether they do a good job or not is immaterial: it's not a health care facility.  It's a money-grubbing operation ONLY.  So if you're OK with that, go ahead.

Why a physician would recommend this place is still puzzling me, and I certainly will take this up with the physician who recommended them.<//review>< userid>

This was my very first experience with X-ray at Beverly Tower Wilshire Imaging.
I was warmly greeted as soon I came through the lobby and approached the desk.
Everyone I came into contact with while I was there was professional and knowledgeable.
Great location, easy atmosphere, and a dedicated staff.</text>

I have been to this Beverly Hills location a few times before for both myself and my daughter. Each time was awesome. The staff is always friendly and helpful. However, for this review I am specifically talking about my experience today.
The whole process was easy and painless. The paperwork was minimal and mostly already completed with my information. The front desk staff was very helpful, efficient, and friendly. The lobby is welcoming and clean. Once I got to the back the technician was sooooo kind and friendly! She made me feel so comfortable and checked on how I was doing while in the chamber. The most important thing I felt was that everyone’s kindness wasn’t contrived!!! I work in the front office of a medical office myself, so I know what customer service looks like and this place has nailed it!!! Thanks for the great experience!!< /Text>

Frankly I was quite surprised that there was no sanitizer anywhere to be found in the waiting room, no one monitored who was wearing a mask over their mouth and nose and especially no one disinfected anything after use. I was afraid to go into the restroom because of this.  The fact that this is a medical center with no cleaning going on except for the floor made me very uncomfortable and will not return to this facility.  I went to the wrong place first and their procedures were quite stringent and I will make sure to go there next time I need an xray.  I will say that the technician was very nice.<//text>

Had complex ultrasound and they made sure to align the right expert to do the test.  They had to cancel the first appointment as they wanted to make sure the most qualified ultrasound person did it.  Most places would have just done it without a care if done right or not.  Ultrasound guy was great and dedicated at what he did.<//text>

Professional. Fast. Communicative. Only hiccup was a patient wandering around barefoot and with no mask. After a few minutes someone came out and said something to her.Other than that everything went smoothly with my MRI and x-ray.< /Text>

When I got off The 8 hour plane ride here I had a terrible pain in my left calf and found the Beverly tower Wilshire imaging Center which they were able to fit me in the schedule. The technicians and the doctor was absolutely spectacular, first class just wish I had this kind of situation in Connecticut. But what an outstanding imaging they are.

I took my son to have an x-ray and the staff were very nice, respectful. They told me that it will take approximately 1 Hour to 1:30 Hours! Everything went very smooth and even the stagg who did the X-ray were very professional and accommodating to my us😀 I had a great experience and recommend this place to everyone 😀😀❤️< /review>

These are some of the nicest people one the world. They are so professional, friendly, courteous, polite, accommodating, and quick; virtually no wait time. I think I waited for 4 minutes! And, one could literally eat off of the bathroom floor to boot. Beware of the parking situation, though. In the evening, the parking garage closes and you may have to use the street meters.<//Text>

Everyone from schedulers, receptionists, and techs were not only nice but made this appointment easier. So grateful to have people like them who work hard to make sure patients like me are treated with respect as they consider our vulnerability when we have to go through testing.

<Review>They asked me to arrive 15 minutes early to complete paperwork. They were right on schedule. They did everything they could to keep me comdortable. Everyone was pleasant and explained the procedure ahead of it.  This was simple and over quickly, but I'm still in awe of the person who invented the MRI technology. It seems like a modern miracle to me.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I was out within 30 minutes of my appointment.Of course I was there for 20 minutes before for paper work. Getting there at 20 minutes before the hour, I was out of there half past the hour.

One of the most efficient medical experiences I have had in any type of facility. They were super efficient and proactively contacting me scheduling the appointment, the first time patient form was partially already auto- filled which was a big benefit saving time & hassle. And the staff on site were attentive and great.< /Text>

Everyone is not only friendly but warm.   I felt well cared for and I think the team genuinely takes pride in their work.   The team is young and the only suggestion I would make is that they take time to explain what they’re doing with a little more detail.</text>

When you need your innards imaged, it can be stressful. The professional team at Beverly Tower are friendly and efficient. It's a nice, clean facility. The waiting room is spacious and comfortable. There is ample parking in the building—and yes, they validate!< /Text>

Beverly Tower Wilshire, seriously!! Is the best in ways, they will never understand unless, patients as myself share, as I'm EAGER! TO DO. This was my third visit with them (im a chicken! With medicine lol) but FIRST, SECOND & TODAY, first! The office is ALWAYS,  PRISTINE! And the quality of care is given with dignity!! Worth and KINDNESS, from each worker. And when you walk in with medical issues on top of COVID 19! HAVING QUALITY SERVICE WITH A HUMAN TOUCH IS KEY.

THAT'S BEVERLY TOWER.

The front office was super efficient and managed my appointment with ease and professionalism.

I raved about the experience at Beverly Tower to family and friends.

Thank you!

Stephanie was my Sonographer during my visit to Beverly Tower and she was ABOVE and BEYOND fantastic in all the ways. Obviously one is getting an scan for most likely a concerning medical reason and she made the actual experience comfortable, fun, interesting, and effortless. (THANK YOU!)
I’d actually say that about my entire experience with Beverly Tower.
From my first call to set the appointment to accessing records after all was completed, the staff and service were great. They paid attention to detail, were friendly, thorough, informative, and made it a good experience.<//Text>

Very thorough technician that was giving me the ultrasound exam. Very explicative and informative about my results. The only issue I had was that he was training someone and it took a while longer because he had to explain every aspect of the machine and procedure in steps and detail at my expense. Otherwise he was a pleasure to have him perform the examination.< /review>

<text>I came here for the first time ever for an MRI. I’ve never had an MRI before so I was a little nervous.  But the staff here is so kind and patient, both the front desk staff and the technicians. The technician took the time to explain the procedure and made sure that I was comfortable throughout the entire process. When I was given the gadolinium based contrast, I did not even feel the technician insert the needle. That was a first. They are is SO well trained. I highly recommend coming here for any diagnostic imaging needs that you have. Thank you so much to everyone that made my time there pleasant!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>The people at the end took over an hour to have my CD ready. When I went back the second time to ask about it, she had it sitting on the desk. She said she had been calling my name which can not been truth. I was sitting just feet away and never heard her. Why didn't she just walk the few feet away and hand it over? She knew I was waiting for it.
To be fair, the personnel at admission, ×ray and the doctor were excellent. It took me longer waiting for the CD then the actual visit.</Review><Time>1581873577832< /Time>< Pictures>

When I arrived I was immediately greeted and there were many people ahead of me. I was there for X-Rays and expected to be there for a long time. I came late in the day and was seen not long  after I completed filling out the paperwork. The technician was pleasant and I was leaving in less than an hour. Thank you for excellent service!</review>

Today I had an MRI done at Beverly Tower imaging.
The staff was awesome .
The receptionist was very warm and greeted me with a smile.
The student technician was Bey friendly and patient.
He was very informative and answered my questions and was easy to converse with. The tech who did my MRI spoke to me and made the experience more enjoyable.<//Review>

Everyone from the front office to the back office and in between were very nice, professional and smiling. That is important to me for customer service. And they used 2 patient identification to make sure there were no mistakes. Give them all a raise in pay! They deserve it!<//text>

I was very much welcome there. The employees are friendly and helpful. I did X-ray, no waiting at all. Some other customers were sitting and waiting but few and not long. The place itself is nice clean and comfortable.</text>

<review>Their scheduling department is horrible.  They don’t know what locations can do what tests. They put at a location that could not do my test then-realized it. Took me over 2 months to get it done and at a location that was 2 hours away. When I got there they didn’t have my appointment. Had to come back a week later. Had they done it right the first time there is a location 20 min away they I could have done it a month earlier. Very sad and disappointed. Management said they would call me back and never did.</review></record>

<review>I was satisfied the procedure. The procedure was well explained before head and it helped me to understand what comes next.

I had same kind of the x ray procedure at the different place. With comparing that, it was much better treatment that I had this place.</review>< Pictures>

<review>We brought our 2-year-old in for an X-ray. They wouldn’t let us make a reservation, they said it was walk-ins only. When we got there they told us it would take 35-40 minutes. It took an hour and a half! For literally a 5-minute x-ray! Meanwhile we had a totally bored toddler with nothing to do. We will never go back to Beverly Tower Wilshire if we can help it and we’ll tell our doctor not to refer people there.</review></record></dataset><record>

The facility is conveniently located, has parking and the staff is professional and pleasant. I have been to this imaging center for years,  yesterday I happened to come on a day when there was a computer malfunction and still staff was very friendly dealt with it professionally and quickly.  The wait may have been longer than other times I was there, but they tried to make the experience as good as they could, even getting us drinks and snacks!!! Special thanks to the manager Olivia.< /Text>

<Review>I was nearly an hour late because of an accident in Laurel Canyon but they took me anyway, so fast I didn’t have time to complete the paperwork.

Was there for an MRI with contrast.  I’m a really hard stick for getting an IV in so I hydrated as much as possible. Still they couldn’t get the  vien. My only complaint is that they don’t have the use of ultrasound guidance for placing IV’s. One would think, it’s an imaging outfit right, no ultrasound?  That’s the only sure bet with me. So they offered the test without contrast which I accepted. Other places I’ve been just would not do the test at all. I may have to go back to do the contrast part of it but at least I walked out of there not feeling as if my morning was a total failure. Very professional staff, very friendly and exceptionally clean. Highly recommended.</Review><resp>None</resp>< name>

Experience was great. The check in was easy, filling out information was easy. The wait was not long. The staff was friendly, the building was beautiful, the inside was hugh, very clean. The inside smelled great, no trash anywhere. I would go to this location anytime. When getting my procedure done, the staff was courteous,  made sure I was comfortable with everything and they explained in detail what they would be doing each time. Wow!!!</review>

<text>The staff especially doctor, nurses, radiology techs etc were extremely kind and nurturing to my fears and concerns. I had a ct lung biopsy and was very nervous at the beginning stage. Due to Dr Somerville’s (and all staff attendees) patience and thorough knowlege of the procedure I quickly became less anxious. The Dr explained every step he made before making it and while doing the procedure. I recommend them highly< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>Made an appointment through my dentist for a CT scan needed for an implant.  Called me day before appointment to cancel stating my doctors office didn’t give them notes needed and insurance info.  After 5 minutes of going in circles I explained for the third time that I don’t have dental insurance so I will pay cash which resolved her issue.  Was told to be there 20 minutes before my 1:10pm appointment which I was.  Did some paperwork, paid and sat down.  Around 1:30pm went up and asked why I hadn’t been seen.  Lady at front desk goes to check, comes back and says issue with last patient, should be another 15-20 minutes but my scan will take a minute.  Would have been nice to know that and why not pull that patient aside and take me since I had now been there over an hour.  Eventually get me, do scan and I leave at 2:40, 1 hour and a half past my appointment time.  Obviously not too thrilled about this place.<//review>< pics>

<rating>3</rating><review>The main complaint is about the staff. I don't know if today is a particularly bad day, but most of the staff was altogether unwelcoming, extremely rude and just seemed like they didn't want to do the job. If people don't like what they do, there's always other jobs. Those kind of employees give the clinic and it's owners a negative image.< /review>< Pics>

<pics>None</pics><Review>I've been to a several ultrasounds for pregnancy and I've never been more uncomfortable. The technician had terrible bedside manner. I couldn't even ask questions pertaining to my ultrasound because she made the environment out to one where I tried and she blatantly said, "let me focus." It seemed like she was weathered and experienced, as she was teaching another technician probably in her early educational years. I was pretty taken back by not being able to ask questions about my own body. Also,  her due date prediction was way off from what my OB said. If that were the case, she should have never answered that question as she didn't my other questions.<//Review><time>1571375650826<//time></record>

Nice place, I can always find street parking. Nice people to deal with.
My last time there when the tech. injected the contrast, was the worst stick I've had. It hurt and bled more than past needles.< /review>

<review>A visit to Beverly Tower Wilshire Advanced Imaging is fast, professional and reliable. I went in for an X-ray, (no appointment needed for X-rays), so I walked in with a book, prepared to wait 30-40 minutes to be seen. Within 30 minutes I was all done and out of there! Front desk staff was friendly and helpful to everyone there waiting, X-ray techs were also great. I should mention they’re we’re 5 people waiting after me and they were all seen by the time I left. Incredible! I would definitely recommend this business.<//review><Date>1536782004715< /Date><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< user>

My only complaint is that I should have been told that wearing a mask is optional inside the MRI scanner. Rebreathing CO2 for 40 + minutes is no fun and causes a feeling is asphyxia.<//Text>

I've been going to the these guys for several years, because they're the best. They are super friendly and efficient, not to mention they're at the top of the fast moving tech advancements to that is the medical field, but they manage to stay there.This visit there was a scheduling error and they teamed up to help resolve it and they did. I'm not a fan of getting an MRI, but when you gotta do it, it's always nice to be stuffed into a tube by a polite and friendly person like anybody on the Beverly Tower Wilshire team! Thanks guys! 🤓

I laughed! I cried! It was better than CATS!< /Review>

Super nice. But I told them I was taking a certain drug and they didn't catch that it should not be used with the contrast dye which resulted in unpleasant side effects after and into the next day. They need to be more careful!!< /Text>

< Review>
I had an appointment at 5:30 pm (5:50 pm to do the ultrasound) on Dec 26th, I went there 2 hours early, and they said that’s fine, I was ready, so I asked if I can do the ultrasound or not they said no go use the restroom and drink water, that’s totally fine and I understand because I was there early and maybe they were busy with other patients, at 5:30 pm which is my exact appointment time I went and asked front desk if they can do it she said no you should wait more 20 min, I said I really can’t so cancel today and give me another appointment, I want there today Dec 28th at 4, I leave my workplace 45 min early because of this second appointment, and I was ready and on time this time, then they said go use restroom and come for ultrasound for your order you don’t need to be full!! Kidding me you guys wasting my time 2 hours and a half two days a go and today I left work early ! They pay me hourly , that’s not fair that I lose money because they don’t care about me that they and just eat , laugh and talk together , if my insurance was not medical they act same?! Or that looks and this manner was just because I have medical insurance?!
It’s not fair at all...<//Review>

< review>
I was sent here from my doctors office which is an hour away. They said it was going to be a 45 min wait for an X-ray but it turned out to be 3hrs. Parking around here is terrible. In pain and in the waiting room though, I saw the bigger picture:

They had a slide show on all the TV’s spouting the benefits of privitized imaging centers VS in-hospital imaging centers... the only benefit is cost, but since I’m on Medicare, I (thankfully) didn’t have to pay, thus, I only saw the negatives. As we know, there needs to be an overhaul of the medical industry here in America. After my experience, I now know privatized imaging centers are not apart of the answer. Please... more in-hospital imaging centers.< /review>

<Review>Showed up early as instructed and still waited over an hour after my scheduled appt time to have my study done. Spent 2.5 hours there for a 20 minute test. The place is a zoo. I would not return here nor recommend this facility to anyone. 2 stars instead of 1 as the MRI technician was lovely.</Review>< user_id>

I'd been told on the phone to fast for 6 hours but when I went to have my ultrasound done it turned out I needed a full bladder and had to wait another 30 minutes while I chugged water. They were only able to do one of two tests ordered by my doctor so I have to go back and do it all again.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b951b65ef119:0xd6e942e1789d80be</Gmap_id></record>

<text>I had been told there would be parking but the day I went the garage was closed and all the street parking was temporarily unusable so I ended up parking in a parking garage that seemed abandoned? If that gate stays open all the time maybe I'll add it to my list of possible good places to park for car sex.<//text>< pictures>

<rating>2</rating><review>Because their Burbank facility did not have a male ultrasound technician, they suggested I re-schedule for their Beverly Hills location which does have a male technician. After preparing for the exam room, I discovered my technicians were two females. They said their male technician is off on Fridays and that I could reschedule. "I do these all the time..," she stated. Disappointed, I allowed them to conduct the ultrasound. After only a few minutes, the technician said she was done with the exam. I asked if she could please scan at other angles. Even then, she barely scanned two other angles and wanted to stay strictly within an area of a few inches. I wanted her to be more thorough, as other ultrasound technicians are a lot more thorough. While I am in pain, I would hate for doctors to tell me they can't find anything wrong simply because the images were limited in scope.< /review>< pics>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>I like how this place works. When I arrived there were so many people waiting, and I thought it was going to take a long time. It only took 20 min for them to finish. They call people back in groups to decrease the congestion of people. It was nice and cool in there as well.

My only complaint is the parking. Bring cash! The parking attendant said they only take cash so I had to go back down to the third floor, take the elevator back to the lobby then go outside to use the atm.

You can also ask the clinic if they validate parking which is something I forgot to do.< /Review>< Pics>

The center wasn’t open at the time I was told to come for the appointment (sat morning). It opened around 20 min later. Once it, all went well. Friendly technicians.<//review>

I was late for my appointment due to traffic--Laurel Canyon was closed--but they made every effort to accommodate me. The ultrasound technician put me completely at ease and made the procedure as pleasant as could be. It is an elegant office in Beverly Hills and they made me feel like I was an important patient, and not just a routine appointment. Many thanks.<//text>< pics>

The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and professional. It took a good while to get my X-rays, but I did go in as a walk-in, so I should have expected that. Finding parking was difficult, but overall experience was good.<//text>

< Review>
My family member had a PET scan here today. VERY good experience with the technician - Lawrence Abrams - who was very attentive, kind and communicative.

They validate parking which is a plus in my books.

I only have 2 complaints:

(1) we weren’t given clear directions on how to find the parking entrance - which is on the south side of Wilshire on a quiet dead end street - so we had to drive around the block a few times In busy morning traffic before we figured it out.

(2)  they should have some form of distracting entertainment for the patients - there are TV screens, but they just have frozen medical ads on them. What would definitely be appropriate is soothing relaxing music piping through the facility to calm and cheer up the patients, especially in the PET scan waiting room and X-ray room because people are nervous about the outcome of their scan and anything the facility can do to distract them would be very much appreciated.

If they improve on these two things, I’d say they’ve earned five stars!<//Review>

Took over 3 hours to get an MRI and a disc with the images. A jammed packed lobby, no temperature taking, no cleaning of chairs between patients sitting in them... I’m terrified after spending 4 months in my home in quarantine, that I will end up getting sick from visiting a doctors office no less.</Text>

<Review>At the outset at the front desk, It was quick, efficient but I was treated very kindly. From the demanding to breath machine to the persons who performed their duties, in connection to why I was there, I was very pleased. Rather not come again soon, but if I had to, I’m sure the experience would be the same.< /Review><user>114269947559371965022</user><Date>1559403965381< /Date>< gmapID>

Friendly staff!  Walked in for chest x-rays between classes and I was in and out in about 30 minutes.  Without having an appointment and considering how busy the place was I expected to be sitting around much longer.  By the time I made it back to downtown for class, I had an email from my doctor's office stating they received my results and were able to provide me with the documents I needed.  Between the friendly and fast service Beverly Tower Wilshire Advanced Imaging Center is a winner!  Thank you guys.  One last thing- and I am embarrassed to admit that I did not get his name, but the gentleman who processed my payment by far made this great with his attention to detail when handling my request.  Thank You< /text>

I drove 1 hour for this location to get A CT scan with contrast because the nurse, Christian always got my vein right so I don't get poked too many time. Thank you Christian for doing a great job as always 😊< /review>

In an out like in an out love the timely manner an how everyone is so nice an clean would  definitely go back if I needed more help from their department today I went in for an x-ray first to see if I can get my MRI done they handled me with such professional status I love how they all work together they seriously know what they’re doing all you have to do is put yourself in their hands And they will do the rest  The faster you do that the faster you will get out don’t rush them  their time is your time so hold on good luck and hope all is well god bless you and they are department</Text>

The wait was long, even in the evening, but once I was seen the technician was amazing at her job and she made me feel at ease by ensuring I was comfortable during the abdominal ultrasound (which tends to take a while so comfort is important). The long wait in the waiting room made me give 4 stars instead of 5.</text>

I was very impressed with my visit to the Beverly Tower Advanced Imaging Center. They have a beautiful Suite in a very nice building just a few blocks away from my apartment. The staff was very friendly and efficient. They got me in and out in record time. I would highly recommend The Beverly Tower Advanced Imaging Center based on my experience with them.< /Review>

I came in for HSG procedure and only have good things to say. Receptionist was very friendly and professional and all the personnel that performed the procedure was amazing.
They took time to explain everything that was going to happen during the procedure and made me feel safe and comfortable.</review>

The mri assistant who walked me from the lobby to the changing room was a noce guy but has a challenge listening to and comprehending what client was saying.  It frustrating hearing somebody tell me or infer im not interested in my healing.  On the contrary i was making sure to dot i and cross t as i was trying to understand how to add a xray to a existing referral. After his insult i called my doctor from the changing  area and she called the your front desk for the authorization. It took all of 7min to get the additional  xray.  I shared with him to slow down and listen.  He wasn't very receptive. Everything and everyone else was top notch...< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I had a great experience here. This was my second time here. The first time I  accompanied my fiance when he was having a PET scan done.
I got a 10:30 pm appointment for a MRI, which is very convenient because I'm very busy during the day. Free coffee is available while you wait. The staff was welcoming and the technician was excellent.  I'm claustrophobic and every few minutes she asked if I was okay and let me know she was there if I needed her to stop and I wanted to get out. Due to my back problem and arthritic shoulder.  It was a struggle for me to get up after the test, so it took me a little longer. She was very patient and helpful throughout the process.
Bottom line, EXCELLENT FACILITY!<//text>

< Review>
Kristy, Raya and Sabrina are wonderful. This was my third lumbar puncture at Beverly Tower and the ladies have always been great caretakers. The experience has never been intimidating and the ladies are very professional. They inform me about the procedure and the after care instructions for me to follow. Thank you.<//Review>

Let's start with the most garbage place you can go to. I own a company who i deal with customers every single day and know the difference but  Unfortunately you kind of have no choice since all the local doctors send you here. I have been here several times over the years over various injuries and everyone here is rude and not helpful and i mean every single time I've called or been here. They even tried to refuse a MRI once because They thought it was not valuable for them and i had to double pay for 2 visits $100 instead of 1 time. They must of forgot that this cost thousands of dollars. I get better service at McDonald's for 99cent nuggets. They just care about one thing $$$

If you can avoid coming here do it!< /text>

I was very disappointed in the wait time when I went there this last time. I was called back to get my x-ray and had to wait a totally of one hour and a half. All because they said they made a mistake. No reason really why they couldn't called me in the room. Before pursuing to take others in front of me. That just got back there wasn't even waiting that long. You guy's should start accepting appointments for X-rays though it would be way more organized.<//Review>

I was told to be there 2 hours in advance because of the need to inject a solution into me and let it circulate in my body.  Sounded reasonable - but so untrue as to make me think they just want people waiting around so their fancy machines are not unused for a minute.  The injection was done during the scan.  You need about 10 minutes to fill out their paperwork.  But then I saw there in the waiting room for an hour and fifteen minutes before I was taken back to start getting me ready for the scan.  If they tell you two hours early, I suggest an hour early is more than enough.  No one up front, though all very professional and sweet, had a clue as to what was going on.  Find another imaging center if you can.  I assume the quality of the work is just fine.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
Once my doctor received the authorization from my insurance company this facility was quickly calling me to make an appointment. I was booked for an early appointment a few days later. The staff was quick to see that my doctor had submitted a wrong diagnostic code and they patiently fixed the situation. The front staff was very helpful and friendly. The fact that the lady who helped me spoke Spanish was a plus! It helps ease people’s nervousness. The two female technicians were friendly and made me feel relaxed during my procedure. They were ready to answer any questions I may have. Parking outside is tough but the fact that the facility has a parking lot and that they validate is so great. Will definitely return to this location for imaging in the future.<//Review>

Said our wait time would be 40 minutes. 2 hours later my sister and I were taken to another waiting room to put on our gowns. This inaccurate wait time prevented us from seeing our chiropractor, having a nice lunch, and being on time for work. Made our day stressful and had to keep running outside to plug the meter. Unsatisfied by their efficiency and staff. They did not seem confident with the X-ray either.</text>

< Review>
This is by far the worst experience I have ever had. They had over a week to get authorization for my MRI and ended up cancelling it the day of because they failed to call my insurance and get authorization. This is the biggest joke ever and I’m truly disgusted with how I was treated. This is people’s lives you are messing with - do your job.<//Review>

<Text>I waited 3 hours for an X-ray. Other people came in after me for an X-ray and went first. One had a child with him - that was not having the X-ray. Another was a child with parents. If I had known I needed a child to get through first I would’ve brought one with me. I did not look at my phone ones. I watched the front desk. I asked when am I next and them kept saying soon. Out rages waiting time. Deplorable and highly disrespectful.<//Text><user>108145311941961494969<//user></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>They're knowledgeable,very  aware of your needs and attentive. Why I gave it four stars instead of a 5 is because the waiting room needs a little bit of air conditioning and also the time seems to when you're seeing be later than the time of your visit which is a case and all doctors offices but otherwise except for those I would give it a five.<//review>< Pics>

<text>I was very disappointed with this visit.  The whole facility looks shabby and the bathrooms were not clean.  A patient walked in to the area that I was sitting in and was coughing, not wearing a mask and was not asked to wear one by the people at the desk.  There was no hand sanitizer available at the various desks where you were asked to sign documents.  I will not return.< /text>< Resp>

<name>Geo Moore<//name><Review>Great staff attitude and love the validated parking. It also seems you can book your tests at times and days most places aren’t open. My only criticism at all is that so many people are seen here so quickly that it doesn’t have that clean and fresh smell I like in medical facilities. A candle or one of those aromatherapy misters that are so inexpensive  in each area would spruce up that slight “ street smell” from being on a major street with lots of traffic.</Review>< pics>

<time>1570826322844<//time><Text>BT Wilshire AIC is a fine facility with competent staffing.  Although I was informed to arrive early for my appointment time, it still took some time before the Technician was able to complete my procedure.  There also seemed to be a minor disconnect with the proper preparations for the patient.  At the reception desk, I was informed to ingest a liquid prior to my procedure to assist in the reading of the scan.
But, once inside with Technician, he was alarmed that I shouldn't have taken that liquid.  He seemed to feel it would't disrupt the scan, but still mentioned that the Front staff didn't follow the Pre-Procedure instructions.
The procedure was smooth and the Tech performed all of his duties with complete professionalism.</Text>< Resp>

< Review>
Had to go in today for a possible hernia. I found the staff to be very informative & kind. I requested a copy of the image & they came out with a CD within minutes. I recommend them for CT scan! Be prepared though to go home after drinking the contrast and have some private time.  Try to look on the bright side and consider it a free enema!< /Review>

<Review>Hello- I am very impressed with Beverly Tower Wilshire Advanced Imaging Center. From the moment I arrived today I was warmly greeted and given the usual forms to complete. The staff is friendly and professional. The office is clean and well organized. And I was especially impressed with the Technologist, Larry, who was in charge of my PetScan from the beginning to completion today. He is friendly, empathetic and very professional. Overall I was extremely impressed with the groups commitment to excellence and their customer centric approach. Regards, Gerald Chamales< /Review>< gmap_id>

It took 3 techs and four jabs to get an IV for an MRI scan in order to be able to inject the iodine contrast. Ouch! I had to be repositioned 4 times to do the abdomen and pelvis scans maybe because this was an older machine. The techs and office staff were nice. I prefer UCLA.< /review>

Made an appointment the day before, and hardly had to wait for my MRI. The woman helping me and escorting me to and from the MRI was really nice and calming, which was much appreciated- I didn't get her name. She was young, tall, blonde, and wear red "college __" scrubs--  she was so great, exactly what I needed before my MRI!! Thank you ma'am!</Review>

For a busy office, the staff is on top of their game.  As a walk-in I was told it could be an hour to two hour wait; it was a busy, rainy day and the number of patients seemed maxed out.   However, due to their efficiency and organization I spent a total of 32 minutes in the office.  It was great, and such a relief during a really tough experience.</Text>

<text>I just had a back xray done which my Dr. recommended -  it is on a first come first served basis - unlike other procedures. The staff were terrific and kept me updated on my wait time. I was in and out within 30 minutes and during that time they checked my insurance - very happy</text><Name>Janine Burke< /Name>< Pics>

Nice clean building. Courteous staff who were wble and willlibg to still accommodate me even though I showed up 15 min past my appointment. Technician demeanor was comforting, no procedural hiccups. Overall, I had great experience. My husband had also used them a few times before, with no complaints.</Review>

The process of registering was straight forward by phone. We arrived half an hour early and completed few documents. The technician came out and called my name. The scanning process was very efficient and in half an hour I was done.
They had parking validation and I drove away.</text>

< review>
Terrible! Everyone's confused, from the call center and the front desk--and the doctor I saw made little amends to explain what the heck was going on or to make me feel comfortable leading into an invasive procedure. The staff confused what procedure I was getting done, so multiple people told me to prepare for it in entirely the wrong way leading up to my appointment date, they were 30min late to admitting me, and then they didn't explain the procedure to me that my primary care doctor had ordered until I was already in the room, vulnerable, confused, and asked to lie back.

Awful experience, don't recommend.</review>

< review>
The people who work at the facility are just ok except only one woman who was so much more HR oriented. I didn’t get her name unfortunately.  She took the time to address my concerns about the safety of the “contrast” liquid  that they use while doing a breast MRI.
It seems that most of the people who work at the front desks, are unhappy with their job. My technician Vanessa was very respectful and professional.
The facility seems very dated and it makes me think that their machines would be dated. The linoleum floors are cracked in the MRI room.
It has always been a struggle to set an appointment and the schedulers vary in terms of knowledge, ability and professionalism. Not courteous, for sure.</review>

I had to leave as I needed to gat back to work.  I came in next morning early 7:45am and was told 15 minute wait, I waited over on hour. When my name was called the person ran into the back room and left me wondering who called my name and why am I just standing at the front desk without any acknoldgement that my name was called.  So I sat back down then about 2 minutes later my name was called again this time I was directed where to go.  I will not be coming to this place again, if I need a scam or xray I will be asking my doctor for another company that can treat me with respect and and not like just a number. Your staff if over worked and have poor management,  not one smile from any of your staff they are stressed and it really shows. I definitely will be informing my doctor of my experience.</Review><rate>1< /rate>< Time>

Upon arrival, I was told that my service would be provided by an intern while the doctor stood-by instructing accordingly; the two of them spent most of the time chatting amongst themselves about images on the screen- I didn't know what was going on and I felt uncomfortable during the experience.

As far as medical appointments go, it was a very good experience. The staff was extremely courteous and friendly.

I was in and out very quickly. I would give them a 9/10.< /review>

<Text>I was in sport career almost from birth, so I’ve had so many mri thru different countries and it was the best experience ever. This company has very solid team who works in great collaboration of kindness and care! From the moment of meeting the front desk to the mri department I felt such a positive vibe! Thank you for that!
Especially people in mri department! They answered to all questions in detail and I’ve got help with each step as I had hardship to lay and stand up. Very grateful! The best team!< /Text>< rate>

Sitting in the waiting room watching cancer videos was horrible.
All of your people were great.

However, in the year of digital everything and speed of info is vital, I am waiting four days to get results. If you are at the top of your industry I expect to have my MRI read by midnight last Thursday and to my doctor first thing Fri morning. You failed me and added stress to my weekend. Not very considerat of you. Harvey Goldstein. I would like a thoughtful response. Thanks<//Text>

< review>
Had an appointment for dad at 7:40 am for abdominal ultrasound. Got there at 7:25 am. Didn't go in untill 8:45 am. Took about an hour for the ultrasound.  Next day, I get a call saying they lost power after we left and lost some of the pictures and now he has to go back to redo the test. Absolutely unacceptable.  1. What's the point of making an appointment if we have to wait over an hr to get in especially when you are NPO. 2. How does a large facility looses electricity. Don't they have a back up. I missed 2 days of work cause I had to take my dad there. This is not the first time this has happened. Everytime, we go there, we have to wait long time. The line is always so long just to check in. I'm never going back!</review>

I'm a little claustrophobic and Deigo made me very comfortable and took time to relax me.   He even put me in feet first since my MRI was on my lower back.
As much as I hated doing the imaging it couldn't have been performed with more consideration and empathy for me.
Easy to find, easy parking, great staff.
I highly recommend  Beverly Tower Wilshire Advanced Imaging.<//Review>

The technician was lovely but the scheduling was quite unprofessional. I was told to show up at 310 for a 330 appointment. I arrived but was told my appointment was at 410 not 330 even though I got a text saying 330. I waited an hour and ten min. Completely unacceptable, and inconsiderate of my time.< /Text>

The wait for X-ray at this facility was way too long (1.5 hours for a 2-min procedure) because they didn’t take appointments. It appeared X-Rays patients were at the bottom of their priority. I was sitting there watching everyone got called in who were there at the same time I was. And I was coughing and felt so sick that it made no sense they made someone sick wait over an hour just to potentially infect others, including themselves in the process. And I didn’t want to get sicker since there were other people coughing in the lobby. When asked about wait time, all the receptionists at the desk were unfriendly and looked unhappy, annoyed, and too busy to deal with you. Seems like a miserable place to work at. Poor customer service and experience overall. I would insist that my PCP to send me to a better imaging Center next time. There are competitions and options out there.</Text>

<text>I had been here for my MRI yesterday afternoon . The staff was very nice from the Reception to the technicians working here .
My experience was good at this place .
My only suggestion is to please validate tickets for parking for patients  or give Free parking for customers coming to this business establishment .
Thank you

Have not set foot yet and over the phone I find it so frustrating to set and appointment for HSG. HSG is programmed from CD 7 TO 10. When I called on CD 5 to set up an appointment as my doctor had told me, they said they only had appointments available but in the valley. To call when my next period will be. Since I have Pcos it's hard to calculate when. Now that I know when he said to call on CD 5 and told him I wasn't since last time they had no appointments. He said he was going to call me back, which he never did. Unfortunately my insurance won't send me to another place. Hopefully my doctor office will set up the appointment for me instead of calling.<//Review>

I had a medical emergency towards the end of the day and needed to get in right away for a pelvic ultrasound. Even though the facility was closing, they managed to work me in. The technicians are excellent and all staff is friendly as well.</review>

Normally I would have given this a better rating, but my appointment was at 7:15 PM.   I arrived at 7 PM  and I never got in until  8:05 PM. My head CT only took a few minutes and then I had to wait 10 minutes for a copy of the disk for my doctor.

Other than that, everything was fine and done professionally<//text>

The staff was friendly and efficient. I got in within 10 minutes of my appointment time and probably would’ve gotten in sooner if I wasn’t runnning a little late. Thanks for a good MRI experience! (Note: I parked on the left side of the building in meter parking and it was $1.50/hour)<//text>

Encourage front office to maintain patient confidentiality by not having the first question you ask a client, “what procedure are you having today?”
Standardize a system where the first encounter  is “hello, my name is...may I check you in using your drivers license and insurance card?”
With a large waiting room with 20 plus people waiting the last thing I want to do is repeat my procedure for all to hear.</Text>

Everyone was nice and polite, but the scheduler messed up my appointment by three hours    They squeezed me in after waiting almost 2 hours   I was scheduled to have an open MRI, but apparently they don’t have one. That was frustrating   And don’t expect them to get the needle in on the first try if you need  to put something in your veins for that part of the procedure.  I don’t think they do that very often there   At least they seem like nice people< /review>

<Review>Appointment was 2 days after I called. I was the last appointment of the day, in-and-out in exactly half an hour. There was no wait, the techs were friendly and efficient. I called ahead to see if I could get in earlier & was told that they were running right on time, so I would have to wait until the scheduled appointment time. Couldn't have asked for a better MRI experience. Veronica was great.<//Review><rate>5</rate><UserId.>111387189901444692258<//UserId.></record>

<review>Conflicting details about preparing for the MRI and two different arrival time. Was told to come an hour before my appointment and there was no need I just sat in the waiting room and no one came to get me till 20 minutes after my appointment. Then the staff ask if I fasted four hours before which I happened to but was not told to do so for the MRI</review>< date>

it says by appointment only. Unfortunately it doesn't really matter when your appointment is they will get to you when they can. I was scheduled to get an MRI at 10:30 a.m. But I ended up getting told at 1:30 p.m. that it would be at least 3 p.m. before anyone saw me. I would only recommend this place if you don't have a job or anything planned during any given day that they schedule or reschedule you to</text>

I had an evening appointment. The staff was lovely  and conscientious. The facility was clean.  Though I had  been dreading the MRI, I  pleasantly surprised, and was delighted with the experience. This facility got an A+ for me!</Text>

Very kind young man greeted me & had me sign in.  I was called to X-ray a few minutes after that, was taken to dressing area for a gown and called right in for X-ray.  The X-ray technician was very nice, friendly and did a great job.  I was finished with the entire process in, I believe, less than 30 minutes.</review>

I was concerned to visit here after reading all the negative reviews. I am happy to say that the techs were so good they made an unpleasant test bearable. Their communication was clear and concise and I understood everything that was going to happen which alleviated stress.<//text>

I am very pleased to share my “Five Star” Olympic-10 Caret Gold  Senior Citizen Stamp of Approval on behalf on behalf of the entire Staff and Medical Center  Operations of the “Beverly Tower Imaging Center”.

For the past “25 years”, I have always chosen Beverly Tower 100% of the time for all of My X-rays, CAT scans, MRI’s and Sonograms. One Stop Shopping..

From the moment I walked through their doors in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, My relationship with them has always been a very easy and smooth experience. I can’t imagine myself going anywhere else for any and all my medical Imaging needs.

As a senior citizen, I try not to waste any more precious time on anything that doesn’t work in the day to day, or is just not in harmony with my needs as I am now in the Autumn of my life.

Thank you Beverly Tower imaging center for taking such good care of me these past 25 years.

I look forward to another 25
:)..

Always

Michael7thSon..

Do yourself a favor, avoid this place at all costs. Many employees walking in circles. Poor customer service. Not accommodative at all. Ask for a referral to a place which puts the client first!!!< /Text>

I've had to go to these people three or four times in the last couple of months they're very professional that get you in as quickly as possible you do what you have to do as far as testing and paperwork and you're in and out very quickly and everybody's always friendly I can say bad about him everybody's professional everybody does what they're supposed to do as far as trying to get you to where you need to be to get your testing done in and out I would recommend Beverly Wilshire tower for anyone that needs any kind of MRI or x-rays or CT scans any of that done I would recommend Beverly Wilshire Tower</text>

The people there made me feel very comfortable and assuring. They took the time to make sure I understood the process, and Christi who gave me the dye injection was very apologetic for any discomfort which made me feel very comforted. 5 outta 5 💯💯💯< /Review>

They cancelled my apt for ct scan without even contacting me . I had fasted the whole day .
After I did have my scan it was very difficult to get results one week later . They said they sent results to dr and they never got them. I am still trying to track down the results .<//Review>

They couldn't find my work order but the gentleman processing my paperwork was very apologetic and i couldn't stay and wait for him to call my doctor he assured me that the next I was there I would not have to wait and he kept his word....so kudos to you guys for having faculty that actually keeps their word!!!</Text>

<review>Jada
Please educate yourself on Insurances. A training from your biller would benefit you, for example if a patient is HMO they need authorization before any procedure is done this authorization will include a CPT & ICD 10 code. I hope this clarifies the difference for you. Also being placed on hold is not being rude. Calling a DR.'s office repeatedly demanding a supervisor on the other hand  is very unnecessarily rude especially when it had been cleared up with the patient that was being referred to you.  I'm honestly shocked by the lack of professionalism. As a member of such a known facility you should be informed of the basics. Needless to say you won't see anymore of our referrals.</review><Rating>1</Rating><Gmap_id>0x80c2b951b65ef119:0xd6e942e1789d80be</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Terrible experience they didn’t have a doctor on duty for my 550pm appointment to preform my MRA! Was informed I had to call them back at 8am next day to schedule my appointment again!! Very disappointing, I am truly disgusted at my experience! I’m literally on hold with them now because the lady told me she put it in notes but now that I’ve called scheduling they say I had the MRA done yesterday!! Very sad , I wouldn’t recommend anyone to go here</text>

< Review>
HORRIBLE!!!

I would leave zero stars if I could!

Firstly, after my PCP referred me here for a CT scan, their robo-caller called me MULTIPLE times a day for two weeks to schedule the appointment! I don't need you to harass me, daily, into making an appointment, I'll schedule it when I get a chance.

On the the day of my appointment, I waited over an HOUR past my appointment time to go in for my scan. The tech, Christian, was extremely unprofessional, and was appartently training a new tech while I was in the room. At least ask me if it's okay for you to make me your guinea pig and discuss my personal health with other employees in front of me.

Worst medical experience, ever. I'll be filing a complaint with my insurance regarding my experience here. This place is a joke.<//Review>

Horrible experience from the moment I got there. The receptionist loooked like she hated being there. She was just indiferent. I said can you help me please. She said yes i proceeded to tell her I was there for my father and that he had an appointment. She then asked for his info. She gave me papers to fill out with out even saying a word. After i filled them out I went over to give them to her and she rudely said just leave them there. Once we were called in the doctor was just as bad. He asked me my dads DOB and the proceeded to the ultrasound room. I waited in waiting area right outside the ultrasound room. Once my dad was done i walked over to speak to the doctor and he had his door closed. This place is horrible no help no guidence no responce from dorctors nor receptionist.< /Text>

The staff is very incompetent and do not know how to check or read Doctor’s order. I went in 2 different time the 1st time I waited 3 hrs because the person who helped me couldn’t find the order the dr sent 2 weeks ago after 3 hrs of calling the dr and waiting with my 3 year old another person said they got the dr’s order. The second time the same thing happen today!!! After hrs of waiting called the dr they said it was sent 3 weeks ago. It took another person to check again they found it then I have to wait to get the X-ray done. You would expect because of the area the facility is in you would get a good service and things get done correctly. Nop!!!< /text>

The staff is rude, they don’t explain anything. They assume you should know what to do in a facility you’ve never been to. I was getting mri with contrast. They make you sit in a gown with a needle in your arm with others, withoutout any concern. During the MRI the technician does not tell you a thing. Just says lay here. Do not go here. Choose another place.< /Text>

I was at the Imaging center this morning to get my injured ankle and heel x-rayed , not exactly how i wanted to spend my “Prez Day” off from work this Monday but the front desk staff was friendly and welcoming and made the check in process effortless, the xray-technician was equally friendly and professional.<//Review>

I have to say the staff was very personable and kind to my son when he was in a lot of pain and needed to come in for a CT w/IV Contrast.  What a great crew you have!  Extra thanks to our CT Tech - Jarod - he totally got it spot on!!  He read my son's (understandable) fears and helped him through the process by explaining it thoroughly to him.  I'm so sorry I forgot the nurses' name that Jarod called in to do the IV, but I want to thank her personally as well.  It's nice to feel like a person first and patient second and they both conveyed that to both of us.  Many thanks.< /review>

Have always had great luck scheduling appointments, even at odd hours which fit my schedule better. Plus, I've had bot CT and MRI there recently and they are 1/5 the price of Cedars for the same exams.<//text>

Waited over an hour because of miscommunication easily remedied by looking on records.

I love their service, it took a while to get me in the system, but after waiting for about 45 Minutes I was escorted to change into a gown and lock up my belongings to receive images of my MRI to be sent to my PCP.< /Text>

I had 2 rude and impatient MRI techs. All they cared about was their time. The MRI techs couldn't even pretend to care about my ailment or my time. I am so disappointed by my bad experience there. I'm not going back there again.< /Text>

<review>This place is a good place to come with but only when the reception is named Michelle is working! Michelle is a very kind receptionist The other receptionist are very rude So if you do come to this place please ask for Michelle she is the only receptionist that is kind of willing to help when you need anything.< /review>< Rate>

The lady who is in the reception was the one who received me and called my clinic to make sure of my state of health. Also the young man who did the study for me was very respectful and kind. He also answered me in Spanish. Excellent workers Thank you for all your help!!

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Regular attention. The only bad thing is that before scheduling an exam they should check the exams requested by the doctor so as not to waste time making an appointment and then saying that they can not. Take the test because the doctor's order is not clear.

(Original)
Regular atención. Lo único malo es que antes de programar un examen deberían de verificar los exámenes que solicita el médico para no perder el tiempo haciendo cita y luego decir que no puede. Realizar el examen por que la orden del doctor no es clara.</Review>
