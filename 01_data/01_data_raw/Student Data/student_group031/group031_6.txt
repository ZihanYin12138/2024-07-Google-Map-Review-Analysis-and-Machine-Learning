Last weekend I went in to get a sim card replacement due to losing a phone. I already had a new phone just needed a sim card. The guy that was helping me just said let me check if i have any 4g sim cards. It was going to go into a galaxy s10+. He came back and said he was out, so I said wouldn't the 5g sim cards still work. And the only response I got was no, and they may get more tomorrow. So I left and then checked online and it says that the 5g card will work on a 4g phone it just will not connect to the 5g network. I confirmed with customer service online. the only response they gave me is that they will escalate the situation but i had to go another day with no phone. Went to different store thw next day and I just asked for a sim card for the s10+ amd they gave me the 5g sim card.</Text>

Rude service associate, he had no desire to troubleshoot my issue despite the store being empty. He and his fellow employees enjoy kicking  sand around on Verizon’s dime. Also Verizon is and has been perennially awful, and I’m over paying 75 a month for my cellphone plan/insurance. Switching to an MVNO.</review>

<text>Went in there during a weekday around 6 pm to start new service. I was bringing in 4 lines from T-mobile.  When I walked in everyone was busy and there was no one to greet us. We waited 20 minutes before someone acknowledged our presence and finally got us on a waiting list. After a total of 50 minutes waiting Edwin Kim (Solution Specialist) finally came over to help us. He was a nice guy but not very knowledgeable. He messed up on importing one of the lines so ended up having to import the incorrect number and change it after, which I got a $15 dollar charge for later in my phone bill. This was his managers idea by the way to change the number. So that was that, then he inquired about my line and said since I am the account holder that I would have to start my service there but I was hesitant because I wanted to take advantage of the Bring your own device and phone number and get a $250 rebate card but it had to be done online. He said I had to add it there since I was the account holder and that I could simply call later so they could adjust it. Well its been 2 months I called Verizon and they are not approving the rebate since it was not done online. Thank you for that, I've lost my trust in Verizon's sales team. Just wanted to share my experience at this store. You're probably better off dong everything online.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1582387874261, 'text': "We're sorry to hear about this miscommunication, Leo.

Made a same day appointment here. Despite a very busy store I was greeted immediately and didnt have to wait long at all. Everyone was very nice and also had a sense of urgency to get me help. Jennifer helped me with an upgrade and some accessories as well. She was extremely friendly and helpful and not pushy which is huge for me. Best experience I've had in a long time everyone was great. One very happy guy here</Review>

<Review>I went in to inquire about how to fix a cracked screen and the staff was helpful with directing me regarding who to call and how to set it up. My mom also visited to swap out a few chargers online support messed up with sending her because they were the incorrect type, and the representative was patient and helpful. The return was rather painless (albeit frustrating Verizon shipped the wrong parts and we had to waste time going into the store because we needed the chargers immediately), and the representative kept a smile on her face the entire time. I was very impressed with their 5 star customer service.< /Review>< user_name>

<Text>Customer service representative Ricardo at the Fullerton store off Harbor and Orangethorpe is a genus.  He does his absolute best to get you what you need and out the door ASAP.  This gentlemen should be the store manager.  He has  great personality,  people person , attention to detail and friendly.  Having a person such a Ricardo at you store will definitely see a spike in return customer as well as new.  this gentlemen get my vote 10 out of 10.....

I've always had good luck at corporate owned verizon stores. This is one of the good ones. Victor helped me out and really took his time helping me find my best options with no pressure and he really knows his stuff. I highly recommend this store.<//Text>

Went in and we were greeted right away.   Within 5 min Gabe was very helpful in removing me from one account to another.  Gabe was very polite and helpful during the whole process.  I would definitely go back again!< /review>

<Review>I visited today because I needed to make a payment and in addition, wanted to buy a fast charging cable for my mobile device. Let me say that upon entering, the store felt uncomfortable and the ambience extremely dull. All the employees were laying on the counters on their phones. Not one "Hi, welcome to Verizon!". No one smiled nor made my visit inviting in any way. Better yet, it seemed like I was bothering them by entering store. I approached a gentleman who inquired on what I needed. ( I never got his name as he had no nametag and he never intented to personalize our interaction). I advised I needed to make a payment and purchase a charging cable.  He asked what kind of phone I had and I advised him that I had an older Samsung Android. He said he thought they didnt have any. I asked if he could look and he said yes.  He went to the back of store and came back with the full charger with adapter and advised me that's all they had. I advised him that I wasnt looking for charger with adapter. He said they didnt carry just the cable. I expressed to him the La Habra location has it and they come in a little plastic case. He advised me then to go there. At this point I was trying hard not to lose my patience. I then tried to make payment but he said i needed a pin. I advised i didnt have a pin and he said i needed one even if it was just to make a payment. I asked him if I used the machine if I needed a pin too and he said he didnt know. At this point I was beyond irritated. I again looked around and everyone remained laying on counters playing with their device in the exception of a gentleman in a black shirt that had "Military Veteran" on the back. I then decided to leave as it was clear the gentleman assisting me had no desire to help me. No one in store showed any sense of urgency, no one asked me open ended questions to try and find a solution for me. No one made my experience memorable in any way. I could have perhaps wanted to upgrade to a better phone, add a line of service or anything of that nature but no one seemed to care.  Extremely dissapointed with atrocious service. The manager at this location really needs to step it up and add some life to the store, train his/her employees and reevaluate with everyone what customer service is. Avoid this place.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dcd601f5cd34c1:0xf43183ecb6de3ea5</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Apparently, if you didn't buy a phone at a corporate location, even if the store you bought it at was a Verizon store, corporate can't help you.

This store doesn't want to help, doesn't want to provide customer service, it wants to make money off of you. They will lie and they will provide you a disservice.

Don't give these people your money. They don't deserve it in any way, and anyone that says they do is simply paid to say so.<//Text>

<Name>Dezi Rose</Name><Rate>1<//Rate><text>They actually deserve no stars.  It is so baffling that Verizon hires low qualified people to represent their company.  I will be sending information to the ceo regarding this store and my experience. They literally wasted my time there and I honestly feel they were discriminating because I’m a female business owner who is younger than them.  I know it sounds crazy but if you only knew what I went through at this location. Just don’t waste your time here.  I advise you to just call over the phone and get it done or find a location that deals with actual business accounts.</text>< time>

The story is that Spanish is the primary language in that store including all of the signage. It is little Mexico even though they are within 2 miles of Disneyland. this is America and we speak the American language. I know it's English but it's our version of language .
The service was confusing the way they explained it and took 2 hours to change over one phone and my wife's number still doesn't go to her new phone and its been a day and a half since we went there. Just so you know the initial cost was $500 for two phones and that's with a two year contract.<//text>

Bad customer service
I was approved for 4 family plan lines I was so excited that's until I went into the store to finalize everything. When I first walked in I wasn't greeted by anyone no smiles nothing, just a place full of mean people. Sales person finally came over after he seen me looking at phones. I told him what I was there for so he got someone to help. His name is Jorge who from the start could care less what I wanted. My excitement was going down and down. He proceeded simply because it's his job nothing else moved him. He did everything he could to show her didn't want to help, then after he left and went to the back and stayed like 20mins he comes out to say "he can't do anything I would have to complete my order online", of course I'm like what?why? He couldn't answer that so I call them on the phone to see what the issue maybe. It was nothing once he got on the phone he then did his job right, but his cs still was bad I had already decided I wasn't going to give this man none of my money..I told him I had to make a quick phone call I had to go to bank to make a deposit but he held me up do long they were closed. He said store policies was I had to pay with bank card or credit card, I guess bcuz of the phones I was getting, no problem. As I was leaving out I told him I would be right back I guess by this time he real real didn't care and clearly ignored me. I'm standing there like wow really. I was so glad the bank was close I wasn't going back anyway.. I felt so bad after I left that place ugh they are bad for business...DON'T GO HERE FEELING HAPPY YOU WON'T LEAVE THE SAME!!!< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><user_name>Robin Greenbaum</user_name><Text>I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS STORE.  We needed to exchange a new Galaxy Nexus phone with a legitimate, OBVIOUS hardware defect (speaker did not function).  The first day we went in, they told us they couldn't do anything because the network was down but were quick to offer to sell us a "backup phone".  They said to come back tomorrow to exchange the phone.  We returned the next day but they told us they couldn't exchange it because we didn't have the receipt with us!  If a receipt was needed, why didn't they tell us this the day before?  Also, this phone is only available through Verizon so they would have to have all my info, making a receipt unnecessary.  The whole time, I got the feeling they just wanted us out of the store and hoped we wouldn't come back to bother them.  It was a huge inconvenience to drive out to this store twice and accomplish nothing.

We went to a different Verizon store where they DID NOT EVEN ASK FOR A RECEIPT and hooked us up right away with no complications.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

Horrible experience with representative Jose. I came in looking for a cover for a I phone 7 plus and was told I would be on the Q when I came in. No problem I said and the young lady pointed me out where some of the covers are in display while I waited. Jose then came out to help and was nothing alluring at all like most of the Verizon wireless reps are. Jose did the same thing and pointed where the cases are and did not offer to show me any nor bring any out (covers are all locked). I felt like I was being helped by someone that got that last customer before going home.  I asked if he may unlock some covers and show  me and Jose did not offer to bring them out of the box but instead started texting away and looking into the sky when I spoke to him. This is my first horrible experience at Verizon wireless store. I also requested a tempered glass screen cover and he brought out one for the I phone 6 not the I phone 7, then went into the back for a long time (I just fell like walking out) finally he came out and said he was out of stock for the IPhone 7 screen protectors. I was done at this point and said I wasn't taking anything. Jose could of cared less what I thought.</Review>

I visited this location to buy a smart phone that was recently released... When I got there the manager told me they were out of stock and to check back the following tuesday.  I came back and another associate told me they had 5 in stock but that they had to keep 5 minimum for new accounts... He said he'd check and see if they had a sixth to sell me.  Turns out they've had these five all week and said that they could order one for me.  I went to another location that said that was total b.s and that its not Verizon's policy to keep 5 phones handy for new accounts.  So this location gets 1star for making me drive across town when I've been a loyal Verizon customer with 2 lines for years!< /Review>

FYI: Don't let them confuse you when considering a Moto Z Droid phone since the Motorola phones on display don't have tags indicating price or model. There are three models: Moto Play, Moto Z, and Moto Z Force (from least to most expensive).

Even with the display model briefly advertising which model it was while in "demo mode", the employee helping me incorrectly identified it and brushed off the video presentation as incorrect (but I knew better since I had done research).

Other sales associates will also probably try to get you to buy the more expensive "Force" model by suggesting it has the best battery of the three, but in reality the "Play" model  has the best battery (least expensive too), followed by the "Force" (shatterproof but expensive and not scratch resistant), and lastly the regular model (thinnest and not recommended).

Lastly, The Motorola Droid Turbo 2 is last year's shatterproof model (also not scratch resistant).

Do a little bit of research or you will be deceived on phones and plans!<//review>

<review>This is an excellent place to get tiles. So many choices. I have been to many floor places and could not find the one I like. I found my mosaic tiles for my kitchen backsplash here. Prices are good and it took them the next day to get my tiles. B & w said 3-5 business days
and I needed it ASAP. Wish I have known about this place earlier. Excellent service. Francisco is Amazing<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

This is the best flooring and tile place I have been to. Always straightforward with what to expect and when to expect it and will give you transparent recommendations based on your budget. I got the most affordable premium vinyl flooring for less than I expected. I wouldn't go anywhere else!</Review>

< review>
Dan of Outlet Tile Center was INCREDIBLY helpful with a closet remodel project in our home. We were in a tough spot as we needed to match the unusual flooring in the other section of closet. It was a very difficult to find porcelain tile product.

Due to the pandemic, our family is staying in-- so I sent Dan photos of the unusual tile. He hunted down the manufacturer and distributor. He helped us place an order. We just received the order this week and it's a perfect match! We are so grateful to the Outlet Tile Center as they have the widest selection of tile and excellent customer service. This was the easiest textile purchase I've experienced. Thank you!< /review>

< review>
Do NOT shop at this store. They are not even remotely interested in providing customer service. Though they pretend to be an "outlet" their prices are higher than nearly every other tile provider around. I drove an hour to get here yesterday looking for tile to match existing tile in my home. I had a very specific conversation with a sales person about the tile I needed for a renovation project. He knew what I needed and was supposed to contact the vendor. I drove all the way back today, and he refused to even ask simple questions of the vendor. He refused to give me any contact information for the vendor. COMPLETE disregard for my time. With typical bait and switch he suggested I find something else. DO NOT patronize this store.</review>

We understand that remodels can be a bit frustrating especially when you are trying to match a specific tile.  We are always ready to help our customers with continuation projects, however, if the tile has been discontinued by the factory, there is not much we can do.   We apologize if we promised to find you the tile you were looking for without first requesting a picture of the tile, brand or series name.  We should have been more thorough before having you come to our store.   We hope you were able to find it in the end.'}< /Response>

The worst airline with the worst employees. Pretty much a guarantee 3-5 hour wait on the Export side.
If this place would at least take care of ONE customer an hour , it would move alot quicker. And that's sad to ask for just 1 an hour.
I don't get how this is the ONLY airline where it takes the longest to process paperwork.
It's annoying seeing employees just sitting there doing nothing . They make it look like it's slow or dead here when in actuality there's lots of drivers who want to get the hell out of here.

<Text>Polite and helpful staff but they need more knowledge of their systems.
I was picking my dog up, they said the dog never made the flight and someone else had to investigate and make calls to figure out that my dog was at pps instead next to baggage claim in the terminal.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeI01-k-KCQpPmWYjoRVv_N_pJqjf2u7SA6HpU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

Switched my flight and NEVER bothered to call me or send a courtesy email .. Luggage check in is super long I was pist after waiting all that time in line so when I reach the counter they tell me that my flight has been changed to a completely different airline waited ANOTHER 40MIN in line to get checked in when I could've waited in the correct airline to begin with and was rushing to get to my flight flew from LAX to Sea-Tac</Review>

Customer service at this place is terrible, they are extremely slow and rude. They joke around and talk to each other while you wait for service. Management doesn’t care either.< /Text>

Hi everyone,
I just wanted to warn you about this place. The owner “Alan” whom we made the contract with back in February 2020 took our money and disappeared. After we checked out the hall venue and all that, we signed the contact with Alan and left $600 as downpayment back in February 2020. The pandemic hit and he never communicated with us or attempted to contact either me or my now husband in terms as to what would happen if the pandemic would still be around by our October wedding event. July came and we called several times and we couldn’t get a hold of him. He called my husband once to see if he would want to change the date of the wedding, and my husband told him he wasn’t interested in changing the date. At this point we weren’t content with the service or the way Alan managed things. Considering how there’s nowhere stipulated in the contract about a pandemic, I believe no one was at fault for this. We deserved to have our money back. However, Alan knew we weren’t coming back and did not give us our money back. The times after this we tried to reach out to talk about that money, he either disconnected his phone or blocked our numbers and never even attempted calling us back. Now considering this place, it’s too expensive for what it is. I hope anyone reading this reconsiders this place twice.</text>

It was a easy process straight forward explains everything in detail very professional and on time also works with you. Hall is very beautiful. Always making up dates. Food is fantastic, waiters are very kind and professional as well as the bartender and all staff included. All my guess we're in love with the hall. Everything from food, photographer, decorations, restrooms, kitchen even there elevator is nice and elegant. You know when they say you get what you pay for?

Fairly decent hall, not too shabby. Quite pricey for what it is but it's the best you're getting in the area. Juan is very attentive nonetheless</Review>

Attended a 15 last night which took place here. It was beautiful and all but when we tasted the food, it was not so good and was served cold. The location is not so great. But the waiters were very attentive and respectful.</review>

Worst banquet hall ever. Yes the place is beautiful, and the decorations are amazing but let's talk about how when the waiters are suppose to be attending the guests. They aren't there they are chilling in the kitchen. I literally had to go and tell them to serve people and brink drinks to the table. There isn't any air conditioning so it gets extremely hot. Once everything is over and it's time for you to get your stuff. As in pictures, movies and stuff like that, you have to be on there ass so you could get them. They didn't give me my stuff until 5 months passed. It wasn't even high quality things for the price we payed for. The owners are rude and they don't seem to care once they are fully payed.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) For there I read the comment of a Mr. Lucas saying that Mr. Alan does not want to return the money or deposit of his event, and call the media.

For these types of people we are as we are in what head it is for this mr to say that.
In this case, what is done is to postpone the event to a new date, be more consistent and not so bad, since small entrepreneurs are being affected to the point that many are going to have to close.
We had an event in that room and the spectacular service and Mr. Alan very attentive, very professional, we were very happy and satisfied, to the point that we are going to do another event this year in August. We talked with Mr. Alan to see if it was possible to postpone the event and he very kindly told us that if and when he had news for when he could operate he would assign us a new date.

Thank you Mr Alan.

Note: this is a time when we all must apollate since it is no one's fault.

Por hay lei el comentario de un sr Lucas diciendo que el sr Alan no quiere devoverle el dinero o depisito de su evento,y llamar a medios de comunicacion.

Por este tipo de personas estamos como estamos en que cabeza le cabe a este sr decir eso.
Sr en este caso lo que se hace es posponer el evento a nueva fecha, sea ud mas coherente y no sea tan mala clase, ya que los pequeños empresarios estan siendo muy afectados al punto que muchos van a tener que cerrar.
Nosotros tuvimos un evento en ese salon y el service espectacular y el sr Alan muy atento muy professional, quedamos muy contentos y satisfechos, al punto que vamos hacer otro evento este año en Agosto nosotros platicamos con el Sr Alan para ver si era posible posponer el evento y el muy amablemente nos dijo que si y en cuanto tuviera noticias para cuando poder operar el nos asignaria una nueva fecha.

Gracias Sr Alan.

<Text>My review is not for the store but for the insurance they offer. Shortly after purchasing a 1000.00 pillow mattress one side stared sinking in alot . Their claims adjuster came to inspect and he did say it was sinking but the end result it was denied because it was not sinking  1 1/2 inches so in the meantime until it does I have to suffer with back pain I guess.</Text></record>

Shopping for a new mattress and since we always drive by Ortho Mattress we decided to stop by. The last one I bought was online and I didn’t get a chance to try it out before buying so it was nice to be able to go in and get the feel of different mattresses.

When we entered we were greeted by Efrain, he helped us out and showed us different ones, from economical to high end. If you are going for the fancy stuff, aireloom is the way to go. Feels great and when you add the mechanism option, the different types of massages make it feel amazing! Be prepared to drop a lot of money for it though. That being said, this place does offer interest free financing if you need it.

Efrain was very friendly, kind and professional. He was patient with all our questions and worked with our budget. You have to go in and try everything out, much better experience than shopping online. Will definitely return here.<//Text>

<review>I made a stop at this location not knowing what to expect. I'm not a fan of sales pitch and quickly turn the other way. Efrain greeted me very nicely and made me feel welcomed. He definitely knows his field and explained what I needed to know. Although I didn't get a mattress this time, I got a great sense of what to look for and will most certainly come back to this location when I'm ready to purchase. Thanks again Efrain.< /review>< Pictures>

After shopping around for mattresses, Ortho Mattress came out to be the best deal for my boyfriend and I! We came out with a better mattress than we were initially considering, and the financing options worked out best! A box, mattress protector and a pair of pillows were included in the price! Jesus was patient with us shopping around and stayed past closing to help us out!<//Text>

Awesome service at Ortho Mattress, Inc in Downey. My Sister and I needed to look for a mattress for our Mother that had hip replacement surgery and needed a good mattress that was comfortable and low profile so it would be easy for her to get in and out of bed. Sleep Specialist Efrain was so helpful, knowledgeable and listened to our needs and and gave excellent customer service. Now our Mother has a wonderful bed so she can have comfort and have a good nights sleep.< /text>

Went in looking for a new mattress. Efrain showed us the options within our scope of comfort. We tried many beds, some soft, some firm. It came down to beds, but ultimately we chose the one we felt most comfortable in.<//review>

I was in shopping for a mattress and Efrain was very informative and honest helping me choose and mattress. Never did i feel he was pushing for the most expensive matress witch I felt at other stores. I would highly recommend this location for all your mattress needs and ask for Efrain he's awesome.< /Review>

My partner and I went to this mattress store with a budget and a mission to get a decent mattress without breaking bank. Vanessa was super helpful and worked with our budget. No judgments. She was really down to earth and also gave us space to try out the mattresses without hovering !<//text>

I was looking for a new mattress after having one for over 5 years now. It was sinking in and I wanted something firm to hold well over time. Found this place and called ahead. Jesus answered the call and was friendly and gave me all the answers I was looking for. Went in and was greeted by Efrain who asked me and my husband what we were looking for. Showed us many different options. We bought a mattress and the best part was that it was under our budget plus free delivery!< /text>

<text>I brought my mom here because she was in desperate need for a mattress. As we walked in we were immediately greeted by a young gentleman, Jesus V. He spoke Spanish so this made my mom much more comfortable. He was very professional, helpful and knowledgeable. He let my mom try out all the options they had available, which they really do have so many options. He was so patient and I am so glad I decided to bring my mom. She was so happy and left with a great mattress at a great price! No other mattress place can compare! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to buy a new mattress!< /text>< Date>

They made sure that there were QR codes imbedded in the game if you ended up stumped on a clue and needed a hint.  We ended up finishing it in just over an hour.  The team at Code Zone was very flexible and helpful in coordingating with me for pick up and drop off.</text><Date>1627357646837<//Date>< user_name>

The kids could not stop talking about how fun it was and us adults are itching to do this again.

My family just had a wonderful time at the Code Zone escape rooms. We had previously done "X Marks the Spot" with 6 players and barely finished. Very exciting, with the right amount of challenge. This time we did "Get to the Game" with 4 players. Though we needed a few hints, we were able to get through it with a bit of time to spare and had a blast. I think this one is great for smaller groups or beginners who want a fun first experience. The staff is great and the atmosphere makes it comfortable, safe and memorable. Looking forward to trying their 3rd room!<//review>

We had family come up from L.A. and doing the escape rooms at the Code Zone in Petaluma were perfect for some great family bonding. The wonderful family who run the place were very nice and patient in accommodating our group of 14. We split into 2 groups, 1 group of adults and the other group made up of the kids. Code Zone was able to run both themed rooms concurrently so both of our groups could perform the rooms in the same 1 hour block.

Our plan was for the adults to do "X Marks The Spot" and the kids to do "Get To The Game." Both of our groups were able to beat our rooms and had so much fun doing so, we decided to book the next hour so we could swap rooms! Again, the adults were able to finish our room, while the kids came really close to finishing theirs. Super fun!

Completing the rooms was accomplished by dividing up tasks, with communication being the absolute key! If you see something, say something, because someone in your group may have come across something that may have you stumped. Overall, the rooms were really fun with the degree of difficulty of each being pretty comparable to one another.

I definitely would recommend Code Zone for a family group event or any other group setting for that matter, whether it be for a work team building excercise or just a group of friends getting together looking for some good fun! Thanks Code Zone! We had a blast!</text>

We can't wait to get back to try the second room as well as their Game Night experience!

<Review>We are a family of 6 adults who went to celebrate our youngest and oldest kids birthdays. We had a blast!!! One of us had done an escape room before but the rest were escape room virgins. So much fun for all of us. We will totally be back. The owner was amazing, patient and super friendly. Go, you won’t regret it! We were still talking about it the next day, such a fun group activity!!!! Thanks Code Zone❤️</Review><gmap_id>0x8085b7343d4496c3:0x21fe90c6d0fa590b< /gmap_id>< Name>

We brought a group of kids who are in a study pod together to help them work as a team and have fun. The experience was awesome. The kids had a blast, collaborated as a group while solving problems.  We definitely want to come back and do it again. Thanks for the effort from the staff. Super accommodating, friendly and helpful.</Review>

We had such a fun time doing our first escape room at Code Zone! The room was fun and challenging. Such a unique and fun way to spend an evening! I felt extremely safe and you can tell that cleanliness and safety are a priority for the lovely folks at Code Zone. I would definitely recommend booking your own experience.</Text>

Went there on Oct 24th 2020. My party had a lot of fun and I plan on going back in the future. We played the Pirate room which was so fun I highly recommend it. If you’re in Petaluma and want a fun way to spend an hour, come here. The staff was lovely and the young guy who took care of our group was very nice! Thank you!!</Text>

<review>I have done escape rooms all over the world. Big cities, small towns, and everything in between. Code Zone has the kind of heart that makes an escape room really enjoyable. The owners and designers obviously created their games with passion and the user experience in mind. I highly recommend.</review>< pics>

Code Zone is wonderful! We booked at a time when businesses were still open, to do the pirate escape room. When the new orders came restricting indoor activities we thought for sure we would have to wait, but Code Zone came up with an outdoor escape room. It had a board game theme, which I loved, and had creative and challenging puzzles.

Safety was priority number one and the “room” and all of its items were disinfected before hand and after we left. They provided sanitizer and gloves. Masks were worn the whole time. I felt safe and had a ton of fun.

This was my first time visiting an escape room, but it won’t be my last time visiting Code Zone. I look forward to coming back soon!<//text>

Our kids (14yrs) had a wonderful time for their birthday party.  The room was challenging enough that they were pushed, and while they didn't quite complete it, they still felt some success in what they accomplished.  They definitely want to go back and do it again, and the other room.

Owners/staff we're excellent in their communications, and as hosts.  Very happy to have this in our town. Highly recommended.<//Review>

My husband and I did the escape room with two teenagers.  We were a bit worried they would get frustrated as we chose the more challenging  one, but the kids really enjoyed it and we did as well.  It was super challenging and even though we were not able to “escape” had a great time.  Everyone at Code Zone was super friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend this as a fun activity for friends or family.<//Text>

<date>1581632898769<//date><Text>Code Zone recently hosted our Petaluma Active 20-30 club for a social event, and I cannot say enough about how wonderful they are! Incredibly friendly, helpful, & easy to work with through the entire booking process. We rented both rooms for a large group of 20+. They were accommodating in adjusting the times so the rooms could be run simultaneously. And very helpful with explaining how everything works, since about half the group (including myself) had never done an escape room. We had so much fun, a challenge for sure, but we made it out! I can’t wait to go back and try the other room! Highly recommend!<//Text>< Pictures>

So much fun! 9 of my girlfriends and I ransacked this place looking for clues and it was a really good time. I've enjoyed several other escape rooms and the Pirate Room at Code Zone is one of the best! The clues are thoughtful and just challenging enough to get you really thinking and the awesome decor give you an authentic escape room experience. It's downtown location is in walking distance to local restaurants and bars. Sara, the owner, was very nice and welcoming. Thank you Code Zone for a great girls night out!<//Text>

I was brought along to participate in an escape room for a friend's birthday party having never really done anything like it, so I didn't know what to expect. Whatever expectations I may have had however were absolutely surpassed by my experience here, both in terms of the level of detail and the complexity of the challenge. Definitely a great introduction to escape rooms and I'm sure a worthy candidate for experienced enthusiasts as well!</text>

<review>We werent sure about going during Covid19 but saw reviews about their sanitary practices that reinsured us.

When we got there and did the pirate escape room, our takeaways are:
1. it was very sanitary and everything was wiped down, hand sanitizer available, masks worn and you only do the room with your group.
2. it was fun for the whole family.  we were four  people including our 12 and 10 year old daughters.  We were on the last clue when time ran out and for all four of us it was fun and challenging and time flew.
3. The staff are the owners and inventors of the eacape rooms and are super nice and really get into seeing how folks in the escape room are doing.  afterwards they said when they traveled (before covid) they always do escape rooms where they go because they love seeing different escape rooms.  they also shared with great enthusiasm how they found the different pictures or props that make up the escape room.

Definitely check out Code Zone Petaluma.  It was a great activity for the family.<//review><Time>1602545835013</Time>< user>

I went to this spot with four friends at around 8:00PM.
We were met right away and set up with our scenario.  We did the "Pirate" scenario and were immediately super impressed with the room.  It was challenging and got us all thinking and working together.  Definitely worth doing!<//text>

Did the pirate-themed room in a group of 4 people. Decently high production value. The puzzles ended up taking much longer than any of us expected, but it still scratched all the right itches. Owner was very nice, and we had a great time throughout.</review>

We took a group of boys for my sons 13th birthday, and they all had a blast! I know it was an experience that they will remember and talk about for a long time. Great way to get them working together in a fun way. We didn’t solve the mystery, but it was ok, they all want to try it again someday to get those last couple puzzles done. Great addition to Petaluma! Great location  for a fun evening out.</Review>

Great time. Lots of mini puzzles so that you know you're advancing. All in my party (age range: 12-71years) had a great time.</text>

Our group (five adults, two kids) attempted the Detention room, and made it out in time! Very fun and clever puzzles. We had a blast.</Review>

We took six 10-year-olds for a birthday party and it was great!  She changed the level of difficulty for the kids and really allowed them to think everything through!  I'd highly recommend them for a fun thing to do in town!</text>

I used there online buying and in-store pick up option.  The web site was easy to use, and I received mail and a call from the store within an hour that my order was ready. Friendly staff ready to help. After checking prices around town, 1 place was out of what I needed, and the other 2 places where more expensive  for the same class of battery.</text>

Batteries Plus never fails to have what I need. It was a quick in and out purchase today for a lawn mower battery and two keyfob batteries installed. The staff are always helpful, knowledgable, and friendly.< /Review>

< Review>
Blatantly lying to customers! Took my iPhone in for a screen repair, and had them change the battery too.  I took it back because there is a faint blue line running vertical just, to my right, of center screen.  They replaced the screen again, and I didn’t have my receipt.  The faint line is still there, and  they say it is at the battery junction and it is because my phone is broken.  They said it was noted on the receipt as previous damage, and they would not honor another replacement in the event it has another problem.  I did not have the receipt on me and they said the broken case was noted on the receipt as previous damage.  I found the original receipt when I got home, and there is a clear ‘NO’ at the inspection note for ‘Frame damage’.< /Review>

On Dec 31, 2019, I brought in an old Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet, to replace the battery. They cut a tiny wire when they removed the back cover, and so had to order a new non-OEM battery AND a new OEM wire. After that the tablet would just go dead (something it never did before) in the middle of using it. The only way to revive it was to plug it in. In addition to that, the on-screen touch buttons were less responsive than they used to be (however, they later told me they were working normally despite my objections based on experience). I had to show them how the tablet was not functioning, and they sent it to an advanced repair center. They concluded the problem was just a defective battery, so they put a new battery in it and returned it to me. A few days later it died again. I brought it to them, and after a few hours they decided that they were done with it, called me to come get it, refunded me my money (sans sales tax), and told me they could do nothing more. That was yesterday, Jan 28, 2020. My tablet is now unable to consistently stay on for more than a few minutes without being constantly plugged in, which pretty much makes the new battery kind of pointless (also the battery they left in slowly drains even when plugged in). The on-screen touch buttons are now very unresponsive. I will probably have to buy a new tablet if I want to be mobile with it. This business with them was only supposed to take 2 days. Almost a month later, I wish I had never brought it to them. They were polite and refunded me most of the money that I paid to replace the battery, but they reimbursed me nothing to replace the tablet that they damaged, and they gave up on solving the problem that they caused. I will likely never go to them for this type of service again, and I will likely buy batteries/bulbs elsewhere.<//Review>

I'm not a huge fan of this store. Every time I have gone into there to buy something they have either try to sell me something I didn't want or what I was looking for was overpriced. The people have to do a square decently nice and informative but it's still a bummer to go into the store and not be able to walk out with what you need. I'm pretty sure they service and provide products for plenty of people but I have just not been one of those. Their selection of LED strips Hardison but I feel like they are more expensive then most of the places I shop. They have a wide selection of batteries that are nice and if they don't have something in stock they can usually find whatever you need and have it shipped to the store within a decent amount of time. Overall I think if you have needs for what they provide you should check them out regardless of my experience. So go check them out and see if they carry what it is that you are looking for.< /Review>

This battery 40R is a bit hard to find. Batteries Plus had them, cheaper than auto parts stores and better warrantee. However this battery did not fit under the slide on battery cover in my 2010 Mariner/Escape and I had to cut away part of the top to get it to fit....the new battery top is different that the factory battery.  Always good to have a battery post puller handy when you change batteries. For some reason these are hard to find for sale.<//Review>

About 3:45 P.M. Sunday, my iPhone 5c is without a battery.  It is the 'office' of my business. Monday morning I will be fielding calls for my appliance repair business.  Without it I am dead in the water.  Richard at Batteries Plus Bulbs carefully explains my options, walks me through the process, thoroughly explains the issues with the phone, and by 5:15 my phone has the needed parts replaced, is thoroughly tested, and back in business.  Very knowledgeable, affable and professional.  Well worth the cost!</Text>

I needed special bulbs that my local store did not have. However, I placed an order for these bulbs through the website and was able to pick them up at my store within a few days. There was no additional charge for shipping since they went directly to the store.  The entire thing was very smooth.< /text>

Everyone at the Redding Batteries+ is awesome, but Justin really went above and beyond great service. I was really stressed out because of a family member who is very sick and I was in a rush - generally overwhelmed and far from a model customer. Justin was very professional but also warm and friendly. He dealt with my crazy very well by diagnosing the problem and explaining the solution. He wasn't able to promise me he would finish as quickly as I hoped, but he said he would call when ready. He was calm and direct and that was really helpful. He was done much sooner than I had hoped. I certainly got a great battery replacement for my phone. Even better than that, when I left I felt so much better than when I went in - this is because of how Justin treated me despite my nuttiness. I am so glad I went in there that day. Please give Justin 5 Big Gold Stars and a Great Big Raise - he is the kind of employee you will want to keep happy so he stays forever! xo<//Text>

I paid a bunch of money to replace the back camera on my iPhone 7 plus and I went to go pick it up I noticed the camera was very blurry and unfocused. I also asked the girl to be very careful with the screen because I had just got liquid glass put on it, and she said okay. When I got it back there was scratches all over my screen. Definitely would not recommend this place their expensive and not worth it at all. Go to Shasta computer repair on bechelli, their cheap and get the job done.</review>

<Review>Easy to use. Ordered online, had it ready when I got there for pick up. The only complaint I have, is not so much their fault. I paid tax, and environmental fees for the battery purchase. Then I had to shell out $16 for a core deposit. When the guy said $17.10, I asked why it's $1.10 more? He said they have to charge a separate tax on the $16. Wait... what? It's a deposit, how can you charge a tax on a deposit? He said it's not the company's fault, but the state of California. So, be prepared to shell out illegal tax on all core deposits. Good old California! The tax me state!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1480693746678, 'text': 'You are correct in regards to the tax on core deposits. This is a state regulation that would apply to products such as car batteries. If you exchange your old car battery when purchasing a new one, you will not be impacted by the core deposit or the tax. We appreciate your understanding and look forward to an opportunity to work with you in the future.

<Text>Replaced iphone screen and it broke within 2 days. Replaced Galaxy S7 screen and it was dead within 1 week. Of course they don't cover them. They made me stand at the counter for half an hour filling paperwork just to make sure they don't have to cover it. Total rip off deal. Obvious scam selling junk that doesn't work. Plus the screen was so broken, Apple refuses to fix it, so I had to buy new a new iphone. While i was at this crummy store, an old man was complaining that he's replaced his watch battery 3 times this year. He was blaming his watch but really it's the cheap batteries. It's an obvious con job at this place and one day someone will shut them down. Think about it - they only sell disposable things that you can't prove if it's good or not. Who knows if a battery, bulb or screen is any good? We trust them and they abuse the trust. They sell junk and then protect themselves with a lot of legal documents so they can scam you with the blessing of their lawyers and corporate overlords. Don't buy anything here - it will break or run out too fast. That's how they keep you coming back to buy more. I paid a huge amount and they installed the cheapest screens in the world - one lasted only 2 days and one 7. And these are phones we have used for 3 years until they got damaged. You'd think the replacements would last at least a year - not only a few days. And the company doesn't care - they put responsibility onto the manufacturer. Avoid these corporate scam artists.<//Text>< UserId.>

I needed to replace the batteries in my RV.  I spoke to a very knowledgeable woman who suggested that I use two 6 volt golf cart batteries instead of the 12 volt one I had.  This worked out great and gave me much more storage capacity.  I ordered the batteries on line and they were ready to be picked up the next day.  The personnel at the store even helped me load the batteries into my car and gave me a wiring diagram.< /Text>

<Text>This place lacks in customer service to an all new low.  They sold my mom a cell phone battery, which stopped holding a charge in a few months.  Her phone would show it had a full charge but the battery would only last a few hours with moderate texting.  We took the battery, receipt and packaging back into the store and were met with Richard.  He was abrasive from the beginning, insisting that it was my mother’s phone and not the battery and then testing my mother’s phone.  His test showed that my mom needed to purchase an external charger for the battery because her phone was not charging to its potential.  I asked several times that the “guaranteed” battery be tested and the employee kept stating that the problem was my mom’s phone and that he “could test the battery but it would be fine”.  In other words, he wants us to spend money on an external charger without testing the battery.  He was so confrontational, and he was rude to an older woman and her daughter. I’d like to mention that I handle the IT orders for a large State office and I have extensive knowledge of cell phones, batteries and all things computer related.  It hurt me to see people so obviously trying to screw my mother out of money.  We took her phone to Verizon, and just as we thought, the phone is 100% fine, the battery is faulty. The money wasn’t even worth going back into that store though; it wasn’t worth the negativity that the employees put out.< /Text>< Rate>

The ease and convenience of ordering our new RV batteries online was A#1. The service we received at the Redding California store was top notch, thanks for loading those heavy batteries into my car. Thank you Batteries Plus Bulbs.< /Review>

It's rare that I give one 🌟 reviews. If I could, I'd give this location a zero. I have a phone that I really rely on that the battery was going out and it isn't replaceable by the consumer. It's a Pixel 128. I'm traveling/snow birding in my teardrop trailer for the winter. Knowing that you had to order the replacement battery at least a week ahead, lithium batteries have to  go ground shipping by law, and knowing that I'd be visiting my friend in Redding, I asked her over three weeks ago to make arrangements to have the battery and possible replacement screen. She dilligently pursued this matter and kept a detailed record of the phone calls and notes on the meetings and was assured by Richard that the battery would be ready and that I had an appointment this morning to get the battery replaced. We called and got ahold of Richard this morning to find out that despite all the efforts we put in to meeting the requirements to make this happen and with a detailed paper trail - nothing had been done. No order, no battery, no screen, no nothing. Furthermore, we were told conflicting bull stories about why it occurred and even hung up on in the middle of one phone call with the statement ''The line was quiet and I thought you'd hung up ' when I asked for a supervisor/manager. The manager tried to resolve this situation yet there was nothing to be done.

Don't go here. Not for anything. Go anywhere else.< /Text>

Screen cracked in less than a month, battery is aftermarket so iPhone Health does not work anymore. New screen would automatically click links without me even touching it. Went in for help and was told nothing could be done. Waste of $180.< /text>

Everytime I go in the employees take care of my needs super efficiently. I've been in multiple times and everytime one employee stands out the most, her name is Justina Symmes. She always makes sure I get everything I need and she has fantastic customer service skills. I always ask for her when I need something. She absolutely great and she makes the experience in this store the best.<//Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>I should have read the review first before attempting to fix my iPhone 8 Plus. I brought my phone in for a broken screen replacement. First service was quick and easy, I soon noticed the display wasn't working properly and was mistyping letters. I bring the phone back and they agree to put another lcd on. After waiting an hour I go back into the store and speak to the technician who was working on my device. He looks me in the face and said I just broke your backlight, we'll have to get a new device approved by manager Jessica. Jessica calls me back and says the backlights not broken and she's unsure why no other lcd's that she has in stock works on my phone ( funny how the one your company put in a few days earlier worked for a few days ) I take the phone to a third party source and they say that the backlight is broken. This was obviously a cover up for the technician and after further review one can only assume this happens often. I gave their 1800 number a call and after putting me on hold to speak with Jessica they said that Jessica said she doesn't know the problem but it's not your backlight and there's nothing we can do. iPhone 8 Plus around $700 small claims court here we go...<//text><time>1572491926308</time><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

This was first visit to Batteries Plus, needed battery for iphone.  Made appt on internet and got $10 discount.  Took about 25 minutes to complete.  Walked next door to Target and it cost me more than having the battery installed...LOL    Will be taking another iPhone to have the screen replaced and camera fixed.

This is Truly the BEST VAPE SHOP IVE EVER BEEN TOO!  I Live in The State of Georgia But I am Originally  from California, I frequently visit my family in California and Stumbled on this shop while here! The owner Aaron is Amazing he is kind, Helpful with what flavor you might want, professional and Is very knowledge  in the vape Business! If your looking for a reasonably Priced shop? That has Premium and Quality Juice or accessories ? This is the place!! You will Not be Disappointed! Great Selection! Thank you “VAPEWAY”!! JG</Text>

<review>Selection is good and the staff is nice, but it's been a 50/50 as far as asking for parts. I purchased a G-priv 3 from here and during that same purchase, I wanted to get a pack of replacement coils. The person helping ended up just guessing which one it would have been. Wrong coils, and the G-Priv 3 I bought ended up being $20-30 more expensive here than from other vendors. Definitely know what you want when you come here, as there's no testers and the knowledge seems questionable.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I was pleasantly surprised with the excellent service I received today.  Additionally, the other employee was assisting two ladies who recently moved to CA and he was taking the time to explain the current laws, etc.   Customer service is everything...and today y'all knocked it out of the park!  Keep up the great service!<//Text>

Excellent custom service, prices and a comprehensive selection; sets Vapeway apart from the competition. I have been a loyal customer since I moved to the area just over a year ago. Vapeway always has what I need in stock and it is truly a one stop shop. I highly recommend this place to everyone! They have recently lowered their prices significantly and are constantly adding and renewing juice vendors and flavors.<//Review>

Definitely better then any vape shop I've been to. There prices are on point and Ian was very helpful. I bought a T150 sigelei mod for 39.99 and I love it!! They have a wide juice selection with my favorite being a flavor called Wiggles (sprite and gummy worms) and it was only $18.50 for a 60ml bottle. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be going back!< /text>

<text>Initially the shop was pretty good.  They have a better than average selection in vapes and juices.  They even went the extra mile to order me coils they didn't stock.  But that's where it ends.

I bought two boxes of T-6 coils, as this is what I usually use and have never had any problems with them.  The ones I got have been nothing but problems.

The first one I used worked for about an hour and then I got an error saying there was no atomizer.  I tightened the tank but no luck so I replaced it.  The second coil worked but within a day I was getting the taste and smell of burnt cotton.  No matter how low it was set, burnt cotton sensation.  The next coil was the same way.

I went back to the shop today and some young kid was working.  Told me I had my settings all wrong and was pushing too much power and that's what was causing the problem.  Even after I told him that had never been the case before.

He called his boss and while not completely accurate in what he related the end result was I could come in on another day and talk to the boss or take a 25% discount on another purchase.

What I didn't tell the youngster was that prior to me coming to the store I took my vape to 5 different shops with the same issue.  Each indicated it wasn't my settings, they were bad coils.

Although I know the shop can't control what they receive, they should honor their product.  Really disappointed in the way this went down.  I know I'll be taking my business elsewhere and letting everyone know not to visit this shop.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1506341640532, 'text': 'Hi Eric. Thank you for the detailed review. Please understand, our Weekend employees really have their hands tied when replacing products (especially coils! ;)... please contact Aaron Monday (manager), and he can test the coil and knows 100% how to test it and show you while he is doing it. If it is the coil we do replace, however it needs to go through the proper channels. Hope to see you soon.'}</resp>< gmap_id>

The customer service here was just phenomenal. A lot of vape places have people working there who just talk down or scoff at you for asking questions but this guy (DJ) listened to every one of my stupid questions and walked me through every single thing I was curious about. He spent the time on me like I was dropping hundreds of dollars and he knew from the beginning all I was buying was a single 5 dollar coil.<//text>

<text>I've been coming here for 8 months at least once or twice  a week. Not because of the service or prices as both are bad. I only shopped here because of it's location. Terrible customer service, entitled young employees who don't give a crap about anything or anyone except their $100,000 BMWs! After spending over $1,000 here in the last few months, you'd think they would treat you better. Nope they're completely entitled, spoiled young punks! Two weeks ago they sold me a coil that didn't work, refused to replace it (cost to store about $1)! Next time I came in to buy juice and another coil they were out of the one I use. I decided to drive 10 miles to their other location...the whole time calling them (11 times) no one answers the phone. So I decided to head home, upset at the waste of time and money over a $4 coil. However I wanted to inform the manager at the original location that no ones answering the phone for 20min at location on Lincoln. Once he was done showing off his brand new 100k M3 to his buddy he said he had a different coil and how great it was! He never apologized for the waste of my time or money. Instead he charged me extra for a coil I didn't even want. The employees are so entitled they park all their expensive cars backwards/sideways in the only few parking spots! So customers have to park a block away and walk in the rain! DO NOT shop here!</text><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

Been here a few times picked up a few coils that were bad out of the package. But on a separate note the juices are pretty damn good and decently priced</Text>

< review>
Spent 10 minutes looking for the stairs to enter this upstairs business. Yes I could have called but that shouldn't be necessary. Ridiculous! Bought some stupid Vape juice at Walmart as my lunch was over. No time for that mess, sorry... Hope your rent is cheap as ppl will follow their map here and have no way of getting upstairs...<//review>

It's reads unit #202 upstairs to direct people. It is actually very easy to find, however, we are sorry you had to buy your juice from Walmart."}<//response><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>1</rating>< GmapID>

Clean store, slightly inaccessible but there is an elevator if you need it for the second floor. Helpful and friendly staff.<//review>

<text>Loud rap music with really ignorant lyrics, small selection of juice and hardware. The staff didn't seem very knowledgeable to specific questions I had. To top it all off they guy whined when I asked for a printed receipt. No point in me returning.</text>< pics>

Absolutely bad horrific scam. I have the row52 app. Saw a vehicle came in and went the next day. It only been 1 day 4hrs and the vehicle no where insight. Also came for other vehicle that came in 4 days ago no where insight. Ask the staff little to no help said it was there but it ain't. Check the hole section not he row just in case misplace but the whole section and looked and each vehicle in the section, Also the yard is a complete mess came on (Sunday) I have been to ipull-upull Stockton , Pick-n-pull San Jose, Newark, Stockton, Oakland, Richmond. All have cleaner yard and more helpful staff.< /review>

A large variety of cars and trucks to choose from. Parts are fairly priced and the personal are very friendly and helpful.  I definitely recommend this place to any mechanic, handyman or simply car user or driver.<//Review>< rate>

Knowing I specified the vehicle I was looking for, gave directions but not the directions I would need walking out of the door to the car's yard, allowed me to head in the opposite direction then I needed to be headed with toolbox in tow.<//Text>< Pictures>

My life partner, Jerry has been a customer of picknpull since they opened ( usually Richmond yard and occasionally Oakland).  We know their policies and haven't ever had a problem.
Jerry is a retired veteran, and has been a self- employed mechanic for a very long time.
Recently we moved to Vallejo so have been going to the Fairfield yard more. We thought we would check out the new American canyon yard.

So he ended up pulling a motor from an Impala for a client of his from this yard for $310 on 10/27. Took it home and installed it. Took the core in on 10/31 (the cashier neglected to return the original receipt of the purchase - although he didn't realize this until days later).
The motor ended up having a cracked head, so he took it back to that yard and was expecting to get the credit due him so he could find another motor to replace it but instead got told that he would get a call, which we never recieved ( this was when he realized the receipt was not in his possession anymore).
RICHMOND ALWAYS STAPLED THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE RECEIPT TO THE CORE RECEIPT -KUDOS TO RICHMOND!.
So, on the next Monday, we took the motor back (again) and asked for Sonny, the manager. And because we didn't have the original receipt ( but we had the core receipt which has a reference to the original receipt's number on it) - he said he couldn't (wouldn't, actually)do anything for Jerry!!
We put a complaint in;  another one to Schnitzer; contacted the Ethics point company; contacted 7 on your side; no response from anyone!!
THIS HELLA IRKS US!! ALL HE WANTS IS THE $280 CREDIT THAT IS RIGHTFULLY HIS!! THE CASHIER IS THE ONE AT FAULT HERE! THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE THAT, THOUGH. SO THE CUSTOMER LOSES! SO MUCH FOR THE STATEMENTS MADE UNDER THE 'INTEGRITY' PART OF THE COMPANY POLICIES! THIS IS ONLY
REGARDING THE PICKNPULL YARD AT AMERCAN CANYON! THEY SUCK!< /Text>

BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Went in to this store with my wife to buy a set of Cepella Sofa and initially did not see anyone in the store.  I Thought that employees are busy n the backroom.  We walked around to see if we would find a coffee table and end tables to pair with it and we did.  We found an associate on the phone and in front of the computer;  i waited for him to finish and when he was done he did not say anything and kept looking at his computer.  I asked him when he is done if he could help me.  He must be having a bad day because he was sarcastic and would not let me finish my question.  He would interrupt me constantly.  Needless to say, wife and I left the store and bought quite a few things somewhere else.  We like the design but service is just not there!<//review>

Great support from all the staff, specially from Jessie.  I took a look at all the styles and items that the usual big names stores have, but nothing compared to what I finally found at Scandinavian Designs in Murrieta.  Thanks again!< /Text>

Hidden Treasure and amazing customer service.

Never felt pressured into sales but was given dedicated attention. Definitely recommend Jerry, incredible service and definitely did what he could to make us leave happy. Got a dining room set and few other pieces and am super happy with all of it!</review>

The folks working were very helpful and attentive when needed.

<review>The salesperson and all the staff were wonderful.  No pressure to purchase yet right there to answer all my questions. Product was delivered in white glove style that used every caution to not scratch anything. Everyone from the delivery people to the manager were so nice and respectful.  No arm twisting and the fine quality of their products speaks for itself.  I highly recommend this store for all your furniture and accent pieces needs. Kudos especially to Anthony!!!<//review>< GmapID>

I was looking for stylish furniture that could hold up to an active household. Kids and pets run amuck in my home. The sofa I purchased is so great! The service staff and the delivery crew were engaging, always in touch throughout the purchase and in-home set-up. Theirs is a rare shop these days, so happy to have found this place!< /review>

<Text>I live in LA and often buy my furniture and interior design accent pieces from Scandinavian Designs. But when it comes to the Murrieta outlet, I have to admit that i had the best customer service experience so far. Alisia was the associate that helped me when I inquired about the media center piece on the phone. She gave me options, informed me about the current deals, and invited me to go over to the store. When I visited the store, she was not only helpful but also welcoming, warm, and really knowledgeable. Overall, I think it's worth the drive if you're looking for good deals and helpful staff.</Text><pics>None</pics>< user>

if you like Ikea you will love this place, if not, then not so much - prices seemed a bit high for minimalist style design furniture. Some items just are weirdly out of place - furry covered couches or benches - like a furrby or whatever, I cant imagine them in my house, so we'll call it a draw and head out to the next place.</text>

<text>After a new carpet install we needed to update our living room. We nosed around the usual furniture stores in the Murrieta Sun City area, but couldn't find just the right thing. On the way home we decided to see wat that Scandinavian store was about. Left with a new sofa, ottoman and side table. So unique. Our visitors always remark on them. We'll be back!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Favorite buffet now. Actually, the ONLY buffet we frequent now. Their hot and sour soup is unbeatable, and you can add vinegar and green onion, to taste. I am so happy with that option. Honestly, I come here for the soup, but the variety of seafood and other meats is excellent and I always leave way too stuffed. But satisfied. 😋 They also have a hibachi grill. Wish the sushi was better though, but even that doesn't take away a star.<//Review>< Pictures>

Low prices tend to attract certain people. At about $25 for all you can eat, don’t expect your fellow patrons to be classy or polite. One family of six, swarmed the crab legs as soon as they came out. Multiple times. Leaving nothing for anyone else. Wow, just wow.

Dinner here was good. I enjoyed almost everything Golden Koi had to offer. Most of the food was full of flavor and not watered down. There’s sushi, Mongolian BBQ, Korean BBQ, various Chinese dishes and then a pizza, huh? Nothing stood out as horrible so that’s a good sign.

The staff is very friendly and attentive. They do work hard to keep this place clean.

It is a bit messy at certain stations but you can blame that on your fellow patrons.

I’d eat here again.<//Text>

<review>Golden Koi did a great job of accommodating protocols during Covid. Everyone had to wear gloves when serving themselves.  I normally do not like going to buffets because the thought of people eating and kicking their fingers and going back for seconds and touching the serving spoon with locked fingers is a disgusting thought.  But because everyone had to use gloves to serve themselves,  this thought was diminished. The food was good and being a seafood eater, there were plenty of selections to choose from. I think the dessert table could have had more variety but I cant complain about the main dishes. I ate on a weekend and I'm not sure if the menu is the same for weekdays but I was definitely pleased with the selection. I would have given it 5 stars since they weren't lacking, but like I said I'm not an avid buffet goer so 4 is the most I would give for any buffet. Definitely worth the drive to head out to roseville. Wish they had one like this in Elk Grove.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>I’m surprised it is rated poorly by some! The workers are always friendly, the food is tasty, what more can you ask for? I took mine to go, as it was Saturday night and the place was at capacity with an hour wait. People know they are back open and are there in droves. When retrieving food, you have to wear plastic gloves. Overall I would recommend!<//Text>< Pics>

Went with 2 adults and 2 children but my 12 year old was considered an adult. Paid $90 dollars and couldn't even eat the crab it literally tasted like plastic or rubber!!! Even the feeling of the crab meat felt plastic. Never going again. Do not recommend.</text>

UPDATE!  The Koi Buffet is now open again! It's all the same great food as before. I just can't see the negative reviews here, cause service is great and the place is clean. The food is all fresh if you get here at a reasonable time. Best time is when they open! Fresh food and nobody has picked over all the food yet!  I gotta go back for those wings and ribs!

Closed for now due to the virus thing, but I really can't wait till it opens again! This is the best buffet in the area for a reasonable price. It's under new management so it cleaner than before and the service is perfect. The food is a generous selection of Chinese foods that you don't normally see at most buffets.

What I really like are the fried chicken wings and the ribs! Yeah Chinese do the best Chicken and Ribs! They even have french fries here, just in case you don't want Chinese food. I've always found the food hot and fresh, but do go 1/2 hr before closing and expect all fresh food just for you, it won't happen. Go at opening 11am! I want this place to open again!< /text>

Used to love coming here, food was great and price was fair. And just like any other Chinese place quality of food kept going down and price kept climbing up. Crab legs were soft and mushy. It’s still ok buffet but definitely not worth the $18.99 dinner price. Very disappointed 🙁< /review>

Went for the second time the other day I mainly go to buffets for the crab legs lol but I was a bit disappointed AGAIN because the snow crab legs seemed a bit old and had no flavor like they've been sitting in plain water all day.. my advice would be just STEAM the crab legs to warm them not soak them.. I Will go back and try again for a third time but if things haven't improved I will lower my rating because I am a crab Critic lol. I'll update y'all I believe in 3 chances after that you're canceled if no improvement 😒<//text>

Food was good. Steady stream of customers for the lunch crowd. Temperatures taken when entering. Everyone wears a mask when not eating, hand sanitizer and disposable gloves worn while getting your food. We'll go again.</Text>

Cons: When getting food, people don't social distance but everyone has masks and gloves on unless seated.

Otherwise, I loved it. Oysters weren't great but the Cocktail Shrimp made it a great date.< /Text>

Pretty happy decision to eat there. Looked at the food before deciding and about 8/10 things looked pretty fresh. This was on a Thursday evening so maybe not the most busy time. At least not very busy when we were there. I imagine weekends to be busier.

This place is pretty big. Could seat many people if needed. Food was good and I think it's cool they have soft serve and regular ice cream.

Mostly pretty typical Asian buffet stuff with a few surprises. The Mei Fun was nice! Thin little rice noodles with a simple and warm flavor.

I might come back if I'm in the area and looking for a buffet again. Sushi wasn't great here but most non sushi buffets that offer it generally meet a low expectation for that.

Solid 4 stars. Service was friendly too! Maybe even more so than most buffets. I'll give them credit there.

5 stars if the sushi were better and more of the food items were fresh. But the price is quite good for what you're getting.

Maybe it's tough for buffets to compete at this price range though because Thunder Valley does a buffet that is bigger and about the same price for dinner on weekdays. Between the two, I'd have to give it to thunder but for the sake of variety I'd probably come here from time to time if I frequented this area a lot more.</Text>

<review>There's a good variety of foods and the restaurant is clean.  The buffet area, dining area and bathroom are clean, and that's each of the handfull of times I've been there. I appreciate that during this Covid time, they are requesting guests sanitize their hands and then put on one-time use disposal gloves each time they go get a new plate of food. The sanitizer and gloves are provided. It's a reasonably priced buffet that offers Chinese food and then some American foods for the pickier eaters (which include a small variety of french fries, cheese pizza, fried chicken, mac n cheese, etc.). They also have good customer service.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x809b21ee172bf235:0x1c377604113065c2< /GmapID></record>

This restaurant use to be excellent.
But now the food was not that good. The food was barely warm, over fried and dry.
However, our service was great.<//text>

<Text>Celebrated our 22nd Anniversarry excited our  favorite buffet was open. We had to dine outside which was okay on a warm day. Food was dry, cold, and limited with no sushi, Mongolian, fresh fruit, or ice cream. They did have many protocols to stay safe with covid to include wearing gloves and mask and eating outside.We loved this place before covid and hope they can make it thru these tough times,but sadly not worth high price with half the buffet options available 😢< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>Just your typical Asian buffet. They have seafood and regular Chinese food a dessert area fresh fruit area. They have a grill station but the cook kept burning everything. They had sushi which was okay. The main thing I disliked was that they used canned tuna in some sushi rolls</review>< pics>

<review>New ownership and food and bathrooms much much much better.  Overall really good.  My daughter and I only bothered to come in because we were driving by and saw the new ownership sign.  Glad we did.  We'll definitely be coming back.  Sushi was actually very good (and cold) for a Chinese buffet.  Mongolian stir fry and grilled shrimp were excellent.  Many other quality options as well in the Chinese buffet selection.  So happy to have a quality Chinese buffet again in the neighborhood!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Love coming to this to all you can eat buffet. Great food and best of all lots and lots of crabs to eat. I want to thank the manager Francis for his hospitality and care for his customers, he made sure I got the best crabs first after they ran out! Definitely recommend this place. Also very family friendly.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The experience was great. Our server was on it with refilling our drinks and taking the empty plates away. The sushi was fresh and the tuna melts in your mouth. I also had bbq mackerel that was cooked in front of you and steamed king crab legs that was tender and sweet. Everything I tried was super tasty. Dinner was around $16 a person but truly worth it.< /review>

New ownership and food and bathrooms much much much better.  Overall really good.  My daughter and I only bothered to come in because we were driving by and saw the new ownership sign.  Glad we did.  We'll definitely be coming back.  Sushi was actually very good (and cold) for a Chinese buffet.  Mongolian stir fry and grilled shrimp were excellent.  Many other quality options as well in the Chinese buffet selection.  So happy to have a quality Chinese buffet again in the neighborhood!</Review>

This buffet has changed hands and let me tell you it's a lot better than the POS it use to be. The new ownership has some decent items to choose from and run this place decently compared to the former hyenas that ran this restaurant. I would give this place three and a half Stars. Not bad and for the price it's pretty decent.

My advice is to get in before the quality starts to go downhill. With places like this usually new ownership tries to do their best but when they start to realize they're losing money it all goes to hell.<//Text>

I don't think I can say anything good about this place...im not a person to usually complain about service but this place was bad. There was zero service for the 2 hours that we were there. To start it off they tried to seat us at a spot that had about a cup full of rice and noodles spilled all over the floor under the seats of one side of the table. We had to ask them to clean up our spot a few times until they actually did anything about it. We didn't get any drink refills(not even water) or plates cleaned off the table the whole time. By the time we were leaving we had plates piled up quite high andthere was little room for anything else on the table. The food was nothing special at all, so unless you are going to only eat crabs you might as well go somewhere else, cause that was the only food they had that was tasty.<//Review>

<Text>For an all you can eat place the food was very pleasing. One of the few we found with crab legs and oysters. The staff was very friendly and service was that of a fine restaurant. Plenty of food variety for pleasing children and adults, the only critical remarks I can say was that the dinner only signs were a bit confusing. I'm sure had I asked I could have cleared up that confusion. I can say the experience was overall pleasant and the restaurant was clean, well kept, and we'll managed. Thank you Koi.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x809b21ee172bf235:0x1c377604113065c2<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>The food was terribly stale and it would have been right to sue them for it.

The flavor was absent.

They charge extra for drinks and the food is large in quantity not quality.

Expect to waste your money by going here.< /Review>< Pics>

First thing you see is a nasty fish tank. The place was also hot and humid. Some of the food tastes  old.  The floors were sticky.  The cups weren't cleaned.

This place could use some help. For now I'll rate them a 1 due to the simple fact that I see no changing in the near future. These are the kind of people who will get by with what they can.<//Text>

I was invited by my daughter and grandsons to dinner at this place...it was appx.8pm...to say the least we will never go back.. they are very racist there,and stood over our table like they wanted to know everything that we were eating...Several guys working there didn't speak a lick of English ,and the manager,made them watch us,and she made sure they didn't say a word to us..it almost seems like a bunch of puppets walking around at her command...there was a old van outside..that made me feel like something wasn't right with the guys that were there...They seriously acted like they had never seen black families dine out,it was very uncomfortable,when my daughter asked about the price change,an older man said something to a older woman ,and she locked the front door...lol..it's a nice clean place,but the people's that running it is extremely rude and never people friendly...I'll pass on this place never to return...< /text>

<review>Hands down favorite buffet in the area!! So delicious, nothing tastes like it's been sitting under the heat lamps forever like at other places. Great service, employees are super nice and helpful. Also, compared to other buffet place prices, this place is priced pretty cheap for the high quality of food you're getting. Absolutely love it, and higly recommend to everybody!< /review></record>

<review>We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch there today. My husband & I are only visiting for a month from Fiji & we depart tomorrow.  Out of the 4 Asian buffets we visited here in California, I am highly recommending Golden Koi Buffet. The restaurant is clean, the varieties of food are so good & the customer service is superb. I ate alot of the mussels on the shell that was spicy & also loved the shrimps that were deep fried. The new manager, Francis, was so welcoming & checked every now & then to see if we were okay. The service boys, were quick to clear our used plates & were also quick to refill our drinks. Will definitely revisit Golden Koi when we are next here in California< /review>< Rating>

Good Chinese buffet with good selection.  Price has gone up some especially weekend nights.  Lunch is the best value.  Don't expect gourmet but look around there will be some good dishes.  If they are doing the Mongolian grill have that.  Don't judge this place on the nuggets and french fries that not what you come here for< /Review>

<user_id>108350969271284054717</user_id><Text>Place was ran down. Prices listed are not accurate. Customer service was very slow and was hard to understand wait staff and hostess. Steamed oysters were not fresh and tasted like sand and dirt. When I brought it to the hostess attention she went and yelled at wait staff in front of everyone for the slow service but, did nothing to help them or try to improve the evening. They are getting one star because my boyfriend was happy they had crab legs and they had a decent amount of meat in them. However, both of us had upset stomachs after even though didn't eat much and date night was kind of ruined.</Text>< rating>

<rating>4<//rating><text>Although this place has gotten better in the past few months they could improve their drink refill times. Otherwise the food is good, if a bit predictable. if they had frog legs, pigeon or oysters like many of their competitors (especially on weekends or for dinner when they charge more $) I would give them 5 stars.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Crab Legs were a bit bland even with the butter.... I enjoyed to Mongolian bit though, kept going back for more... Servers are a bit rude and don't refill drinks often at all. Oddly enough I'd probably still be willing to go back.</Text>

Best seafood buffet around. Salt and pepper shrimp, coconut or Walnut shrimp, crab legs, lots of times they have called mussels too. And that's not even 1/3 of the fish selection! They also have decent sushi (although it's not the best) and a grill, plus all the stuff you would expect at a Chinese buffet. The only downside is that the floors can sometimes be slick. I one-time went in wearing a special boot from my doctor's office... Had never had any problem with it anywhere else but it just didn't have enough grip on the slightly slippery floor
I ended up leaving halfway through my meal because I was seriously afraid of falling.</text>

It was okay there is a lot to choose from sushi bar crab legs Mongolia bbq type stir fry bar. But the melted butter for the crab legs tasted like plastic the crab was cold and wet like it sat in the pot it was cooked in all day. But it was worth the 12.00 i recommend there ribs they are awesome<//review>

Buffets!!! What can I say, most buffets are the same but if you manage to go right when they open is the best time to go.

Small buffets dont have enough people coming in at open so they dont make enough food then you find yourself waiting for things.

Not here, at ooen at least be smart when you go to a buffet, Golden Kois good is great to taste, fair priced, and they're always stocked, bot running low like some other chinese buffets. Maybe that's why they're one of only a few left around here?

From best potstickers I ever had ( because it tasted like they were partially deep fried) to their deep fries shrimp what else can i ask for?

Trust me theres more, just go!!!< /review>

The buffet selections are extensive including many Chinese food favorites, soups, sushi,  and Mongolian grill.  Ambiance is up scale and spacious. Servers were attentive.  I enjoyed my $10 buffet lunch plus drinks, and would do it again. I'm a little surprised the weekday lunch crowd was rather light.< /text>

The two ladies in the front had their own thing going instead of making their area look good. Your lobby is your presentation, right?. If that is right at front, Can you guys imagine how dirty is the back where we don't get to see?? Uhh goosebumps...< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Actually, 2.5 stars. The interior deserves 3 stars. To me it seemed a bit dark. Some chair legs are a bit torn. The front desk lady seems doesn't care about being polite. The food ... the food didn't look fresh and tasty. Some of the sushi looked real old. The lunch is inexpensive. And that's plus.< /Review>

Good food. Their customer service I feel like depends on their day. Food is good though and great options to chose from.<//review>

Best buffet in our neighborhood since change of ownership.  We get so much better reception at the front counter and the increased variety of dishes make it hard to be unsatisfied.< /Text>

Food was alright, did not taste so bad, though some of them were cold & dry. Staff were nice. Ate some fried crab, craw fish, stir fried noodles, fried rice, some sushi and kimchi. I don't know why my throat has been hurting after I ate there. Had to take some Aleve hope it helped but it still hurts. Will not come back again.< /text>

Top notch price for bottom of the bucket food. It was hard to find something edible on the Buffett. For 2 adults and two children it cost 66 dollars to eat. There are much better places to go around here.<//review>

<review>Food was not good. Flies. Employees kids running around, like 5 or 6. Dirty tables. Employee was having lunch at the table next to us, slurping a bowl of gross stuff. Windows looked like they were cleaned with a stick of butter. Waited a long time for dishes to be picked up. We should have walked out. This place was great a few years ago. Don't waste your money.<//review>< resp>

We love this place! Lots of foods to choose from. Sushi and lots of cooked foods and deserts too. Only waited a short time for seat once on a holiday, and usually get right in. Can do a carryout here too.</Text>

<review>I am not sure why the others are saying the food isn't fresh and delicious.  It is every visit for me.  It must be the day and time of day I usually go (Sunday, about 1pm).  Everything is fresh and hot.  They couldn't restock crabs 🦀 fast enough. I enjoyed just about everything I normally would order at Chinese restaurants. I don't get food poisoning from eating there.

Three things I don't care for there: salad bar, sushi, and the grill to order meat. 1) Chinese food isn't about salad, it's about cook veggies. Don't eat that raw greens at buffet. 2) sushi is Japanese food. Chinese are notoriously bad at making sushi. If you ever had bad sushi, chances are the owner of that place is Chinese or Vietnamese.  3) I watch those guys grill...not sure what it is but they manage to burn the meat all the time. Plus they don't change tongs between raw and cooked meat. That's just asking for trouble. Avoid these 3 and you'll have a more enjoyable experience.

I dock a star for crappy service, as it is expected of Asian restaurants to have crappy service.< /review>< pictures>

Been there so many times cause it's great for big parties and almost never any wait, the food is not always fresh and sometimes you can even taste it that it went bad. Last time we were there it smelled so bad like rotten eggs, no joke.<//Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>If I could give them zero Stars I would. My wife and I went there to celebrate her birthday and our 10th anniversary. We went during the dinner rush and the food was horrible. Everything was either cold or overdone the sushi looked like it had been left out in the sun all brown and wrinkly. The fresh meat for the grill looked at least a month old some of it was indistinguishable. The hot and sour soup was anything but hot and sour more like slippery and slimy. The vegetables in the salad bar were wilted and not very fresh at all. The desserts were dry with no flavor. The ice cream came out of the machine like liquid. I didn't want to pay but I learned watching Judge Judy that if you eat the steak you have to pay for it and if you don't like it don't have to go back again and you couldn't give them a review that shows how I feel. I would not even sneak food out for my dog. So heed my warning it's not worth the money or the stomach ache I'm sure to have later.</Review><resp>None<//resp><date>1532666946004<//date>< rating>

This Chinese buffet is glorious. Glorious. So much of so many kinds of food. So much food. Also I'll just say, they've often got pricey stuff in the buffet: crab legs, fish, shrimp, beef, Mongolian bar b que.
Fried foods.
Kid friendly foods (a whole line up of the kind of stuff kids who don't like Chinese food would like: fries, chicken nuggets, desserts, salad, etc). And two dozen more things. Classic American Chinese food: chow mein, been and broccoli, fried rice, General Tso's, orange chicken, etc etc. Also Soups. Crab Rangoon, egg rolls, pot stickers, teriyaki skewers. I truly cannot remember everything, just what I've tried.
Bring $12-15 and feast</review>

Way over priced horrible food. They honestly shouldn't be allowed to serve what they were giving us. Plus the tall server's that works their attempted to help us when our daughter spilt her drink, he went and got a rag wiped up maybe half of the split soda, laughed at my daughter, and walked away. Don't WASTE your money !!!!!!! I'm actually feeling kinda sick righting this.</review>

Rude front desk staff/supervisor/owner. Plates still wet. Food is not good for $16 price. We are  not done eating and they started cleaning with the smell of bleach. If you guys will accept guests last minute before you close, dont make us feel like you are rushing us.< /Text>

The food was just ok. The service was TERRIBLE. The manager is extremely rude. We had called about prices before we went in. When we got our bill we were charged more then what we were told over the phone. When we asked about it the woman was extremely rude about. On top of that it was freezing inside! Customers were eating in their coats. The staff was walking around in winter coats. When we mentioned it they just looked at us and walked away !!!! Absolutely terrible service.<//review>

<review>We came here when the place first opened for the day. The sushi was not the prettiest but we still got it thinking maybe it'll still be okay. It was probably the best thing we had but nothing special. I got a steamed oyster and shrimp, neither was clean on top of that both were bland. The rest of the food we got wasn't even heated to the right temps it was all luke warm. I 100% wouldn't take my friends or family here again.<//review>< Pics>

I normally do not like buffets very much due to lack of variety. Golden koi though has it down right there's just enough of everything to keep you interested. Staff is alert. Food is great and there is a wide variety.</review>

<user_id>105121732117294790021< /user_id><Review>If I could rate them zero stars I would. We had a party of 12 for a bday. The entire 2 hours we had not one person come up and ask us for a refill.  And worst of all they didn't bother cleaning our plates off of the table. Second,  the lunch service food is absolutely disgusting. Tasteless and a waste of money. I think the only thing I ate there a d enjoyed it was the wonton soup. My kids didn't bother eating their pizza, French fried, chicken nuggets, doughnuts,  not even their fruit. I mean just terrible. Never coming here again. Not worth the time or money. There are plenty if other buffets in worse r off areas that are much better.<//Review>< Rating>

<Review>Food is decent but the facility is neglected. There hasn’t been a toilet seat on the toilet in the men’s bathroom for a couple of visits. Had to ask to use the women’s bathroom for my 3 year old. The soap dispenser is also off the wall so no soap to wash hands. What do the employees do? Disgusting. Won’t be coming back here.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Very nicely furnished inside the restaurant. Food looks great, but not fresh. I got two salmon sushi and had to spit them out. Tasted like day old sushi. Most of the food are not good even the order to grill meat.
The only okay food were split shrimp with cheese on top, order to grill shrimp, the ice-cream, the fruits. Everything else are horrible. My friends tried the oysters and they said they were okay, but I didn't dare to try.

The only redeeming value is the nice decorations and the place is huge, a lot of space. Price is good. I think it was $15.99 AYCE on July 4th. So that's probably dinner price.</review>

The food has been going down in quality for some time.  Lunch buffet does not serve Eel, Tuna, or Salmon sushi anymore.  Some food is palatable, but most of the items during lunch is poor quality.</Review>

terrible customer service and food is barely edible, seemed left over from day before, one person in our party got violently sick from the grilled meat. they would not honor our 1/2 off on the 2nd dinner because the others in our party got the senior discount even though we got separate checks. not deserving of even one star but you have give star to be posted<//Review>

<text>Just yesterday my family had lunch at Golden Koi Buffet. This was the first and last time we visited this place. We didn't find any outstanding food in comparison to other buffets, but service turned out to be much worse. For more than an hour while we were eating our lunch nobody even tried to offer a refill or pick up durty plates from our table. We had to make a tower of dirty plates and left-overs in the middle of table. It seemed like they have forgotten about us or just ignored. We didn't even receive our meal ticket at the end, so strongly decided not to leave any tip for such shoddy service. But voila ... 10% tip (or as they call it service charge) was already included to our bill. Any attempts to get it waved were unsuccesfull. SO, KEEP IN MIND BEFORE YOU GO TO Golden Koi THAT YOU'LL BE CHARGED 10% MANDATORY TIP WHETHER OR NOT YOU RECEIVE ANY SERVICE.< /text><user_id>117944645768714234661<//user_id><Response>None</Response><Rate>1<//Rate><username>Oleg Y< /username>< gmapID>

The food was HORRIBLE and so was the service. I asked for fresh food and the owner said no one else was complaining. Very Rude and argumentitive. To boot my son got sick and is now throwing up. I suspect food poisoning. He said he NEVER wants to eat there again and neither do I.</review>

Weekends are very busy and food quality has gone down since opening a few years back, but overall good for the price! I can only handle going once in a while due to the crowd hanging around the buffet in hopes to grab a plateful of crabs and shrimp first!< /Text>

Food is terrible... not warm, over cooked. Sushi is bad quality. The staff always changes. I used to be a fan of this place. Not anymore. Nice neighborhood, nice bulding and plaza. The temperature of the air is either too cold, or too hot. Currently hot. I would rather eat outside! 1 star for the building.< /review>

<Text>Absolutely HORRIBLE! I never write reviews unless they are pleasant, however I felt compelled to write this to warn others how disguting this place is & to help people save their money. I spent $31 bucks on garbage. The food tastes like its been sitting under those heat lamps all day. Huge health concern. The sushi/tuna was turning brown. The crab legs were filled with water and tasted like old fish...not crab! My sons chx nuggets were so hard he couldn't even bit into them. The dessert buffet is cookies they bought at wal mart, left them in the package & set out for people to grab....like really?? That's what I'm paying for? The wait staff is not friendly at all. Workers are playing on their phones behind the food counters, just ignoring you. I could go on and on and on....but I think you get the picture!!!!!< /Text>< time>

<Name>Andrew Quattlebaum< /Name><date>1514338242235<//date><rating>1</rating><Text>Waiter was almost completely non-attentive. Never removed a single plate. I placed all used plated on a nearby table. We also had to request refills. Definitely could use some  coaching.

The cooks refilling the buffet were significantly more friendly and kept me updated on the ETA of what I was looking for.
They even looked me in the eyes as I was talking to them. I don't see a lot of that anymore.

I was going to give only a 2/5 star rating, but the cooks by themselves earned, and deserve, the third star.

- UPDATE -

Dropped to a 1/5 star. Prices are NOT posted. Adult dinner buffet is $16. Two children in our party, same age, charged different prices. Tip is added to the ticket. Our waiter didn't earn at time of anysize. I just had to wave him down to remove a stack of 4 plates. Total ticket for 2 adults, 2 children, and 2 softdrinks, and aadded tip... $51.04.

We will not be returning.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Super disappointed. Food was not as good as before.  And then they wouldn't honor a free birthday dinner for my son because we didn't have his birth certificate. REALLY, who carries a birth certificate with them and he's only 15, so he doesn't have a license yet. We had a party of 6 people, so needless to say we won't be back😣😣< /Text>

Food is horrible, it's cold and you can tell it's been sitting there for a very long time! Worst service ever, couldn't even get water! Stood in line to have chicken cooked for me and 20 min later they got one of the bust boys to cook it. No one was there restocking the buffet trays so the food options were very low. Place is dirty! Will never go back!!</text>

Bottom Line...the food is awful. I don't have high expectations for a Chinese buffet but this place sucks. There were a couple good things but for the $12 or $14 or whatever it is for lunch, it was a complete waste of my time and money.< /Review>

The service was wonderful, the people were very friendly, and were definitely on top of things. As for the food, it's mostly seafood oriented, so if you can't eat seafood or don't generally enjoy it, the number of items is severely limited. If you are a seafood buff, it looks very appetizing and I was very excited to see whole cooked crawfish among their selections, not something you generally see west of the Mississippi. I was also happy to see the bean-paste filled items, something my family greatly enjoys when we go to any oriental themed restaurant.
The soft serve ice cream, though, was definitely refreshing, having a vanilla custard flavor that was very delicious as opposed to the run-of-the-mill watered down vanilla you can find standard in a lot of other oriental buffets.
I would've been a lot happier, though, if there had been more beef-based products, or dishes that didn't have fattier-ended meats. The General Tso's chicken is also VERY Americanized, very sweet with very little spicy and sour. My current take-out place wins over The Golden Koi.</Review>

My 2 friends followed me in, they didnt eat because they had just finished eating greasy Mcdonalds. I told the staff it's only me eating and immediately they motioned their frail asian waitress to watch us like a hawk for the entire duration to make sure I did not pass a single rice grain or grape to my friends. No water refill. Napkins came right before they gave me the [charge fee ticket on the tray] to go pay. I ate at lunch time and it lasted to the crossover of dinner, they plastered many "Dinner only" signs above their newly switched better food trays to deter me from tasting it. Their bathroom is so dark to the point of it being spooky, you might start thinking about Freddy Kruger lurking in there. But really, the darkness is a slip hazard. The staff has no personality at all, they're all doing the mannequin challenge up until its time to take payments, then back to weird mode. Dessert section is horrible. 3pm Lunch time foods was obviously from 11am due to visible limp brown broccoli. I'm not talking about brown gravy all over it, Im saying the heat lamp destroyed greenness of the vegetables. Even the onions have wilted to fetal positions. Bendable  carrots. No crisp snap. Do not try their cheesecake, it tastes just like a flavorless styrofoam or a dish washing sponge (texture!)<//text>

Food was terrible , my girlfriend didn't even eat it, she tried a salad, but that too wasn't good, how to you mess up salad? When we told the people who work there, they said to us oh well its always the same.. I think they may be right, re-heated food it tasted like.

Stay away from this place,  YUK!  We wasted 40 bucks that night.</Text>

Food was just ok.  Seemed old and under heat too long.  Too expensive for the quality.<//Text>

<Text>Very poor customer service. When paid for dinner the waiter was on his phone while was doing his job. It's not my first time coming to this place.... Thinking that they changed their customer service skills I always get disappointed...< /Text><Date>1466628577820< /Date>< Rate>

Went in for lunch and they had tons of fresh sea food which was excellent quality for 10$. Better than most even more expensive Chinese buffets.</text>

Food is going downhill fast. Crab legs way too salty probably cause they were bad. Both my boyfriend and I got deathly sick afterwards. Service was horrible you'll die of thirst before you can ever get a refill on your water. And heaven forbid you use all your napkins you'll just have to use your shirt I guess.</review>

Food was all lukewarm and bland. Sushi was alright, but not worth going for. Service was good (they took our plates and filled our drinks quickly), except for the fact that I think they just topped off my drink with soda water instead of actually refilling it.

Would not go again.< /Text>

< review>
Went in for my son's 11th birthday dinner because that is what he asked for. We provided documents to show his age, birth certificate, and then asked for his ID to provide him his birthday "surprise" that they provide. The place was empty and I now understand why, service is terrible. We haven't eaten there before and never will.</review>

(Translated by Google) The food is very bad, shrimp any two or three days old, the appetizers are hard bread and gelatin. The whole rice was also hard as days. And now I don't even follow him ... I went by recommendation, but I'm not going to stop there again. 😖

(Original)
Muy mala la comida,camarones cualquiera como de dos o tres dias,los aperitivos el pan y gelatina duros. El arroz todo duro tambien como de dias. Y ya mejor ni le sigo... Fui por recomendacion pero ni loco me vuelvo a parar ahi. 😖<//Text>
