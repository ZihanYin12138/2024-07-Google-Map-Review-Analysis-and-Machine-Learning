Discovered this place by chance, but ended up being a regular. CREAM Chico is the place to go for your ice cream sandwich needs. They use baked goodies and even waffles as bases for ice cream sandwiches. There has always been friendly service. It would be a great place for a date or just a quick sweet treat.</text>

Delicious options and goodies to choose from.  Polite staff and decent prices.  Inside isn't very big so during hot weather may get a bit busy.  Still well worth it for a cold treat.< /text>

Store really needed to be cleaned.  The employees had no idea how to make a malt so I had to kind of explain it from a previous job I had. Newer employees really shouldn’t be left alone without proper training.  The employees were super nice though and explained that they were new.< /Text>

The second time I came here about two weeks later, the cookies were rock hard but the ice cream was still good. Seems to be a mixed bag from hour to hour, my advice would be to call in before you make the trip to see if and when they will be coming out with fresh cookies for the best possible experience. :>< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Fast and friendly service, options were amazing and so good! My family really enjoys coming here to satisfy our sweet tooth, or to cool down on a hot day. Topping options are fun and extensive. Prices are very reasonable.< /Text>

My boyfriend is vegan, so we always appreciate the three vegan cookie options and two non-dairy ice cream options. He's also really impressed that the servers always go out of their way to get clean gloves and non-dairy surfaces to create his food on--it was more than he was expecting! I had the vegan chocolate cookie with soy mint chocolate chip, and it was delicious!

During the summer, expecting long lines and a bit of a wait. There's not much seating inside, so it's more of a grab-and-go place, but it's well worth it.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x8082d8774b6f7af5:0xeae00bee8c7a08f9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My wife and I have been here a few times now. Each time has been ruined by the horrible staff working here. Today the girl working the counter actively showed the fact that she did not enjoy her job. She was impatient with my children while they ordered. When my wife ordered, her and my daughter both watched her roll her eyes when my wife asked a question. My wife did not order anything after that. We will not return. 3rd time is the charm.</Text>

<Text>This is a great new addition to the Laguna dinning scene. Great food, really well done. I loved the ambience even though recently renovated it still has historic touches that tell a story of the old Laguna beach. Definitely a must try!</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuxFHrRaCk_aO09KzLOe3qJ-idkBjYNj2QxpfK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnS88MlSFKgfQprckK9qc2iFOxDxC3kWGerMq_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

Long time Laguna residents... first time at Ocean at Main!  So happy with everything... the service was exceptional and the food amazingly delicious.   I highly recommend the lobster fettuccine.  Such a fun and great restaurant for any occasion.  It was my 30 year anniversary and I could not of been happier, the food and atmosphere here is incredible.  Easy 5 stars< /Text>

<Review>We came here for our sixth anniversary. The food is pretty tasty and the service was great from our waiter Zack. We loved the Mediterranean artichoke dip and the endive and pear salad. The chipotle chicken pizza had very little flavor and next to no chicken, but they graciously swapped it out for the shrimp and grits with crunchy bits, which was very good.<//Review>< Name>

<review>Great place! Former long-time head chef down the street at Montage, now running his own place.  Congrats, because this place is a home run.  Certainly one of the best dining experiences around.

The room is open and very comfortable. The service is professional, personable and very attentive. The food is seriously out of this world.  Great salads, homemade pizza and pastas, all high end, are done really well.  Seafood is very present, but I had the pork and loved it.

This may be the best overall restaurant in Laguna right now... Pretty much a perfect night out.</review><Resp>None</Resp><user>110326414720018839779<//user><username>Joe Vraneza</username><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x80dce56c6e7ca751:0x5e041ab282e26055< /gmapID><Rating>5<//Rating>< time>

My wife and I were looking for a nice place for an intimate dinner and thought this restaurant looked good. We were a bit under-dressed, but we're greeted warmly and seated promptly.

The service was great - friendly but not overly familiar, prompt and attentive. The food was excellent! We shared the octopus appetizer on the recommendation of our server, and it was superb. My wife had the Hawaiian prawn and potato soup, and it was excellent. She thought her beet salad was only okay, but my turkey sausage pizza was very good.

All in all, we thought the food was excellent, and we would definitely eat there again if we were looking for something special. The only negative I can think of is that the wine list is pretty expensive.</review>

Thank you for bringing your talents, food and wonderful customer service to the neighborhood.
Can't say enough about the quality of the food and atmosphere. TIP,  If you're a fan... add the shaved truffle to the risotto. The desserts were all outstanding. The spice cake is a must try.   Our server(Torri) was gracious and attentive. So glad Taverna is gone. Ocean at Main is a delight and welcome to stay.</review>

Absolutely excellent food from start to finish. Great atmosphere. Our server Tyler and the entire staff were exceptional. We have been dining at the Montage for years while Chef Craig Strong was the executive chef. So excited he has his own restaurant.  Chef always prepares amazing dishes.  Highly recommend. We will be returning again and again.</Review>

<review>So disappointed. We came here for our 4th Wedding Anniversary and the whole evening was just so unorganized, I didn’t expect it at all after seeing such wonderful reviews.  We sat down at 5:45pm, ordered the artichoke dip to start and a pizza for main. Our dip came out maybe 45 mins later... and after another 35 minutes we asked where our pizza was and was told there was a delay in the kitchen.  However other tables came and went that sat after us. We ended up asking them to cancel the order.  The waiter asked if we wished to take the pizza as it was next out the over... another 5 mins passed and we saw him serve other tables so we just left as it was now after 7pm & wasn’t paying more than the $15 on parking for no dinner... such a shame.</review><name>Bianca Matthews< /name><user>101749976662323402939<//user>< Time>

<review>Overall, a nice experience, maybe a 3.5 actually. Our server, as well as the lady at the front, were not restaurant pro's, but they did nothing wrong.  I had the salmon.  I didn't think it was a particularly tasty.  It came with a sauce which may have been  the sauce for the vegetarian 'pot au feu'.  Interesting wine list.< /review><Name>David W<//Name></record>

<Text>Best kitchen in OC.  Never contributed to a review before but his place,  I feel compelled to review.   Outstanding service, great beach atmosphere, and Sweet Mother of God the bar cigars and potato skins  are a taste of Paradise.

A party of 12 of us dined on Monday, August 5 and after 45 minutes we walked out due to the terrible response to our drink and food orders. Of the 12 one salad came out with less than a beet on it some lettuce, a couple of slices of a cherry tomato and a charge of $17.
We had to ask three times for two Dr. peppers for the kids. Outside of the one lady who served the wine the service and concern for our orders was terrible. I would highly not  trying this restaurant. The positive reviews  had to have come from employees, the owner or relatives. That restaurant was not busy as was the rest of the restaurants in Laguna.  The manager was walking around and did not come to our table to ask how things were going.< /review>

Too busy enjoying my food to take a pic!  This is the first time we have been here and sat at the bar since we arrived before dinner service. The cocktails are unique and fresh. Matt, the bartender, was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. We had so much fun hanging out that we were still there when dinner was available!  The flatbreads from their pizza oven were insane!  Just like in Italy!  Thin, crispy crust but with incredible toppings that were a definite improvement from any I have had in Rome. We also ordered the lobster fettuccini that is topped with lobster bisque!  I don’t know why this hasn’t been thought of before!  It was so rich and satisfying that I was full it still wanted mote!  We truly can’t wait to come back for the full dinner experience in the dining room or the beautiful patio.  We met one of the servers, Dez, who was so friendly we want to come back just to continue our conversation. All-in-all a great new restaurant that is not to be missed!!</text>

They don’t payoff your debt they just dispute it from your credit but it doesn’t get paid. The company can take you to court and have you paid for the debt obviously at a lower amount. I have disabilities and I been going through a lot, it seems that they like to explain things to disable people in a way that they made it sound that it was going to get paid. They take advantage of disable people. I would not recommend it specially if they take advantage of disable people. The lady that I spoke to said that I wasn’t allowed to take them to court. That the contract said that unfortunately my personal support worker was not home that evening.

If you want your debt to be paid don’t go with them. They said that I can’t get my money back but she was going to scale the call to someone else who would make that call. But if I get anything is because they are being nice and because they feel bad for me. I have so many health problems and now I have to deal with them making my health worse.< /text>< date>

If it were possible to rate ZERO stars, I would. This company is a complete scam. Thankfully I realized the scam before they took all my money and completely ruined my credit score. I have been trying to cancel my enrollment for 72 hours now. When you are initially signing up, they call you 8-15 times a day until you answer the call and talk to them for about 45 min. HOWEVER, when you need to cancel, it takes 4 different people, absolutely trash attitude and behavior. I spoke with someone named Carla Bassi, if she's who you're sending to people to change their minds about cancelling, she needs to be fired. Most unprofessional phone call I have had the displeasure of experiencing, and that says a lot since I work in the Entertainment Industry. Ed Bohanan, who is supposed to be an "Account Manager", claimed to have emailed my cancellation confirmation, He never did, and when I asked, he "doesn't have time for this" and hung up on me. Best Believe I will not be letting this go. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SCAM!! Will be filing a report to spare other people from this disaster of a company.<//text>

< Review>
After months of handing over thousands of dollars I finally realized what this company really is. Remember the game with the cups on a table where they slide them around and then you guess which cup the coin is under. They do nothing but collect yr hard earned money and shuffle around yr accounts and call you once in a while. It's an immoral scam and most likely you will get sued by yr debtors. They are horrible.</Review>

<Review>We wanted to buy a house and Elite DMS was recommended to me for helping to clean up my credit reports. The first thing they tell you is that this kind of protocol takes time but that the process is extremely effective. They delivered what the promised to do and that made us so happy! I highly recommend this place!</Review>< user_id>

From threatening calls to tens of messages filling your phone memory, staying behind a loan can be stressful. Fortunately, I joined the Elite DMS credit and financial rehabilitation programs that gave me hope and a second chance to showcase my financial ability. One thing that I really liked about the whole thing is the accessibility of the account manager and the fact that he was always willing and ready to respond to my questions. I have no problems encouraging other people to enter the program provided by Elite Document Management Solutions to enjoy the peace of mind I am experiencing.<//Review>< response>

My wife  and i gave this company a call to see if they can help with our debt. We thought about it and figured it was not something we would do right now , unfortunately  we did not qualify for what we had in mind and we dont have any problem paying our bills on time . But what they had to offer will and would have worked . There process is effective and great for the long run. Its worth a chance for any one who is having trouble  with credit cards ect and honestly unable to get out of the hole.
There team seemed vary professional and extremely knowledgeable .

<Text>I considered several services before I contacted Elite Document Management Solutions. I just needed affordable relief and as fast as I could get it. After I spoke with customer care, Elite DMS advised me that it can take a little bit sometimes. However, my third party collection activities stopped almost as soon as I contacted them. They worked really quick to get creditors off my back. It was less than a month when the threatening collection calls and letters finally started to decrease.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating></record>

I have had been wallowing in endless debts for some years until I heard of Elite DMS from a friend. I had never imagined myself getting out of it, but I finally got back to my financial ability thanks to the expert help and amazing credit repair programs that I was enrolled in a few months ago. I am so glad that you helped me and I shall be happy to recommend Elite Document Management Solutions to someone else experiencing a similar or even worse situation.<//Text>

<review>It pleases me to be once again on top of my financial stability owing to the great and professional help that I obtained from Elite DMS. I came to realize that nothing can stop anyone from achieving financial freedom except oneself. When I first came into contact with the financial experts at Elite DMS, I didn't know that they had the capacity to rethink and tweak my credit strategies.

I had been working with Elite Document Management Solutions for about six months or so when my income drastically increased again. Their services has helped me a lot and I was worried when I could not make my payment. I called Elite DMS and they were very understanding. As a matter of fact, they even helped me find a solution and made alternate payment arrangements with me so I could continue to use their services and get back on track.<//Text>

I was seeking pre-approval for a home loan and my credit was less than stellar. That's how I heard about Elite Document Management Solutions. I contacted them and explained my situation. After reviewing their credit restoration program with me thoroughly, I thought it couldn't hurt and I am glad I went with it. Elite DMS helped me to clean up my credit, which in time allowed me to finally be approved for a home loan with the standard down payment.< /Text>

It was the alert I received from their credit monitoring that informed me of the fact that a “ghost” was masquerading as me trying to open a store account with my information. Having your identity stolen really gives you a sense of violation and the process to clean up that theft is lengthy but much more damage could have occurred if not for the early alert from Elite.<//review>

I did not understand my paperwork, and I decided to use Elite Document Management Solutions. The company had great online reviews and pretty much everyone I knew recommended them. They helped me review all my information for clarity and accuracy to ensure that every detail on the documents was correct. They maintained a high level of professionalism which stood out for me. The best part is that it worked the very first time. I'm glad I went to them, and I would seek their services again. I highly recommend it. You won't regret the decision.</text>

<Review>Last year I had a lot of issues growing my business as a result of inadequate finances. Well, I had a good start with my business, but in between, I got stuck as everything in the bank was used to finance my startup. It came to a point where I thought of making the tough decision of closing my business. But you know what? That's not what really happened. A friend of mine referred me to Elite Document Management Solutions, and I was able to talk to one of the financial management experts who guided me through the process of getting and managing funds to boost my business. Today, my business is thriving because of the advice and guidance of Elite DMS.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Well apparently some shady individual applied for a credit card using my name and purchased my social security number, address, and phone number from the dark web. Elite DMS alerted me about this and the bank canceled the card and is conducting a criminal investigation. I want to thank these people for detecting the attempted use of my information for fraudulent use. Thank You!</Review>

I've always been weak with paperwork, and it is a bit too much for me to ensure all my financial documents are in order. I learned about Elite DMS online and saw some positive customer reviews. I called them and got an appointment, and going to them helped to a great extent. I was not expecting such a fast service. They were quick to check my documents, pointed out some discrepancies, and made some corrections. The whole process was prompt and took a day. I had a good experience, and I will go back to them in the future as well. I recommend them to anyone who is looking for financial documents assessment and financial advisory services.<//review>

One of the most stressful parts for me to get my finances together is to ensure complete and accurate documents that I can present to get loans or relief. I learned about Elite DMS online and reached out to them with all my loan problems. I can honestly say I never felt more in control as these guys corrected all my financial documents and explained to me all the options I had to get immediate financial relief. I had good sessions with the staff who were well-experienced and told me how some financial solutions could ease my loan burden. They confirmed and verified all details on my documents and helped me find the perfect loan program that gave me good support. I would recommend them to anyone who wants to work with a professional team of financial experts.</text>

But this company did not stop me from obtaining their services. They allowed me to continue with the training program, having notified them in advance about my financial status. All I can say is that Elite DMS understands their clients better than any other company out there.< /Review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I got my loan application rejected by two different institutions. Both times they found issues with my documentations but were of little help to correct me. I was browsing online and stumbled upon the services of Elite DMS and was immediately hooked by their document checking and loan facilitation services. I booked an appointment and was happy that I was taken on a phone call where the sales rep explained the whole process of document charges, loan options, and services fees. The ease by which I provided them the documents and got the verification makes Elite DMS my top preference for document checking and verification.< /Review>

<text>When I called Elite DMS, I didn't even know what was on my credit report, just that I let it get out of hand. I was ashamed and embarrassed by it. However, making that call was a game changer. Elite Document Management Solutions found several errors on my credit report and was able to get it fixed. In addition to that, they also monitor my credit and have helped me get back on the right track in taking care of my finances.</text>< pics>

Not going to lie, I went to them for debt solution thinking this was perfect someone can finally help with that headache but I spent over $750 with no results at all. Sadly I had one account in litigation and they did not ask about it or say anything in regards to litigations so I thought it was all good, then when I brought it up on our first call a month later they basically had to remove that from the program and my debt ended up being under $5,000 for them so I guess they just didn't see the worth in doing that. They charged me for September when they knew I wasn't going to be qualified anymore well ahead of time. I thought they would at least refund that $250 but they didn't. In my opinion if you don't actually provide the service you should refund some back instead of just not calling back and saying I'll talk to my higher ups and see what I can do. I'm not gonna complain because I'm still young and I'm learning the ways and I just got a high income job but if you want to handle your finances, just google, it's 100% better and free of charge. Just take the minute of your day to do your own research rather than asking someone who barely knows more than you do. I was only paying because my time was more valuable than the headache but that was a mistake going with this company.< /Text>

Elite Document Management Solutions is a great place to get help when you are in financial trouble. I had issues with my credit card and needed to move away from debts. Elite DMS helped me to get my life under control. Their staff is exceptionally experienced, and they helped me to review my information for accuracy and clarity. They ensured that every detail on all my documents was correct. They also offered me several financial solutions to assist me with my debt and determine the best ways to deal with the situation. Through their program, I'm now hopeful that I will soon be debt-free. I'm grateful for them.</Review>

I found out about Elite Document Management Solutions through a colleague. Before then, I was lost on to manage and clear the debts that needed covering. The elite team helped me to review all the information for upmost clarity and accuracy to ensure that that all the information on my documents was completely correct. They put my mind at ease that I can deal with lenders directly now. I'm now at peace, and all I needed to do was consult with them. Not having to stress about my lenders has brought some life in my life. The team was also friendly and accommodating. I loved everything about Elite DMS.</review>

<text>I thank God for my friend who informed me of Elite DMS services before then I was totally on how to clear all the debts I needed to cover. Moreover, thy removed the headache from me having to receive calls from my lenders and instead deal with them directly. I'm at peace now as I make my monthly payments and I'm well informed of all the updates I need to know from the lenders without having to deal directly with them. The staff at Elite DMS are friendly and accommodating to my needs. All my headaches are taken care of while I concentrate on my work and pay my debts pressure-free.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1582293965860< /Time><rating>5< /rating><name>Ronda Fernandez<//name>< gmapID>

<review>I was struggling with too much credit card or unable to move away from debt. Elite Document Management Solutions(EDMS), used their experience they have to help me get mine controlled. They had a staff who has first-hand experience with all manner of financial hardship so they were prepared to help restore my financial freedom. EDMS offered me a variety of financial solutions to help me with my debt and to help figure out new and progressive ways of dealing with my debt. By utilizing their debt relief program I stood a chance of freeing myself from debt.<//review><GmapID>0x80dc00716abdb189:0x6b51d411410b046d</GmapID><Name>Richard Demers<//Name><Rate>5<//Rate><date>1582666481654</date>< Pics>

< review>
When I needed a van for work I found what I was looking for at Lupita's Modesto. I went to see it and I drove home with the van - so easy. Aftera year I needed a car for my personal use and the first place I looked was Lupita's. Same exceptional customer service and treatment. I bought  my Grand Cherokee on the spot and I am loving it. I couldn't recommend them more. I will definitely come back as business is growing. Thank you!< /review>

<Review>My husband and I can definitely say getting a car at Lupita’s auto sales was definitely the best experience ever! Ever since we called the first time, Pedro gave us great customer service. He helped us so much every step of the way. He had a lot of patience helping us find something we liked and could afford. We definitely recommend Pedro when looking for a car there! Our experience was great!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

<Text>I worked with Horacio at Lupitas to purchase a car. The car needed to be delivered, as I live in a different city. At first I was concerned about buying a car remotely, but Horacio was very honest, professional, and accommodating throughout the entire process. The purchase was very low stress and I would definitely recommend Lupita's Auto Sales Modesto!< /Text>< pictures>

This dealership is great! My wife and I came in and let me say that this was the easiest and most hassle free experience I've ever had buying a car. And quick!
The girls were great to work with and answered all of our questions and delivered high costumer service. Went above and beyond for us as well as super friendly and made us feel very comfortable. I highly recommend Lupita's Modesto.< /Review>< rate>

<Review>Best prices in all of the central valley and surrounding areas. Noemi Chavez aka Nay Nay was able to assist me in finding the right vehicle based on my budget. She was able to help me in obtaining the best financing options available for me. I will definitely be buying my next vehicle at Lupitas Auto Sales.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>My husband was looking to buy a truck. We checked out several dealerships and ended up at Lupitas.  We met up with Maria.  She is very friendly and also speaks Spanish which is a plus. If you are looking for a used car or truck come check out this place. And my husband did buy a 2017 truck with very little mileage. Thank you Maria!</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The experience working with Lupita's Auto Sales was a complete nightmare.
We live out of state but the drive isn't too far and my father-in-law really liked a vehicle they had at their Modesto location, so we drove to attempt to purchase it.
After taking a look at a few different vehicles a decision was made on one he really liked, there were a few things that needed some work and they offered to fix it or give us a credit for it. We chose to have it fixed, drove back the following weekend to pick-up the vehicle.
After filling out all the paper work needed, we were ready to hit the road!
14 miles into the drive the check-engine light comes on.
We called the office and the "manager" says "no more excuses" whatever that means. We got back to the dealership & were told we could leave the vehicle or getting it repaired in our home state & they would reimburse us.
We decided to take the chance, it drove fine.
Arrived at our destination, safe & sound.

Then came the nightmare of having the vehicle registered.
They insisted on registering it, in the state of California, even though our home state was Nevada.
I legally CANNOT have a vehicle registered in California if I reside in Nevada.
We were told this was being taken care of & we would have a response in no time.
Eventually called a different person who, tells me she knew nothing of our situation & states he would take care of it.
Finally 4 weeks later, after getting passed on to multiple people we received the document we needed to register the vehicle.

Perhaps its that we purchased out of state, but this isn't a place I'd ever recommend.</Review>

<Review>I don't recommend this dealer but take your risk and ask for the history of the vehicle your buying my husband bought a truck here it only lasted 3 years for the motor to give out. We went back look for the guy that sold us the truck no one new who he was, they told us he was no longer an employee there how convenient for them.<//Review></record>

The ownership recently changed and decided to give this location another try. This place is amazing! The customer service was outstanding and the staff was extremely patient. I got a delicious ice cream cake and I am definitely going to be back very soon. A lot of flavors available too!< /Review>

<Gmap_id>0x80c29dc6a22cf6ef:0x4e9d7887c1c08dff<//Gmap_id><text>I googled this establishment Before driving down. google says it’s open until 10 pm.  I drove, parked and as soon as I stepped on their side walk the lights to the store got turned off.  This was at 8:30. Confused, I decided to get Boba next door instead. I went back to the car and the lights at baskin Robbins went back up.  I tried calling and they didn’t answer the phone.  I knocked on the door and the young man ignored me.  The least they could of done was explain the website was wrong.  Have some good manners.<//text><rate>1<//rate><user_id>109185956915950342453<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

The selection surprisingly has grown under new management, having more sherbets and ice cream choices than before but it looks slightly more ghetto in the back with all due respect.
The staff is really friendly and they won't rush you when you're deciding a flavor.
I will say their ice cream cakes are pretty bad as far as ice cream cakes go.<//Text>< name>

<text>FREE birthday ice-cream ~ Sign up on their email list!!

The Service: Very friendly, when I showed him my free birthday ice-cream coupon, he even wished me happy birthday!! The service is very efficient and professional!

The Ice-cream: So creamy!!! I chose "Very Berry Strawberry" ice-cream. BIG piece of strawberry almost every single bite. Super refreshing!

The Parking: Private parking lot in the plaza (FREE)< /text>< gmapID>

Maybe it's just me, but I prefer the Thrifty ice cream at Rite Aid a couple doors down. Equally delicious and way cheaper. This place does serve shakes and sundaes which Rite Aid does not.<//Text>

Awful service- just attempted to get ice cream- worker gave a kid 9 samples when the line was out the door. Then- we were next and the worker allowed a jerk to cut in front of my daughter and I. Left and went to Rite Aid for ice cream. What a joke.</review>

We moved to Oceanside 3 weeks ago and have been restaurant hopping ever since trying to find our "spots". This is, by far, is the best of the best. Everything- food, service, prices, overall vibe.. just perfect. Not only great for date night but awesome for a happy hour hangout. Plus the patio is dog friendly! We will be back every week for sure! (And might regret sharing this gem)<//Text>

Food is good,service is friendly, ambiance is nice.
But watch your card receipts make sure you put a line through the tip area if you leave a cash tip. I left a $20 dollar cash tip on a $92 bill and the server added $14 dollars more on the tip line of my receipt. Called and spoke to management they said they will look into it. 1 call back stating they are still looking into it then the nothing resolved</review>

We went on a Thursday which was prime rib night so of course we had that and it was spectacular! The homemade sangria was refreshing and delicious and the desserts we ordered were out of this world! Highly recommend this great little find in downtown Oceanside!</review>< pics>

<Review>Amazingly charming little place. Came here with the family for a late brunch. The food was excellent and the staff were super friendly. Tried the Pacific eggs Benedict and I'll be coming back for more.< /Review>< userid>

<review>We were very much looking forward to dinning at le citron. Live music and offering of prime rib brought us to the restaurant. The food however came out cold. I can overlook slow service but food temperature is a deal breaker for me.<//review>< username>

Best place I've gone to eat so far in Oceanside so far. Don't underestimate the Creme Brule at the end of a meal though, two people can definitely share it.  Really rich and thick but delicious.</Review>

Great service-Lori was amazing! We sat outside on the patio they had live music that was not too loud so we didn't have to shout to talk (very nice and unfortunately doesn't happen often with live music). To eat we had coconut curry mussels, escargot, and the whole sea bass which was filet and deboned table side and it was delish!! Friends has paella and other dishes that were amazing too!! We also had all three of their desserts. Definitely will go again. Go support this local business!!!!< /review>

<user>118073854156402021028</user><Text>So my boyfriend and I had a reservation for this place at 6:45pm, we arrived right on time. We parked right in front of the patio seating area, in which I noticed two empty tables. The door way where you wait to be seated, seemed to look more like a busy area for the employees- they kept running around and between any customers who walked up and stood there in the door way. It seemed at if there was only 3 employees whom were attending the customers, none of them really cared to approach us. Instead the man who might of been the owner,  walked up to us, allowing his mask to stay resting on his chin, instead of over his nose and mouth. He asked us how big the party was. I told him we had a reservation for for 6:45 pm, and then he told us to wait five more minutes. We stood there for about 15-20 minutes. One employee wore a blue and sparkly mask that was sheer/mesh. It was not protective at all. She also wore bell bottom jeans, and a grey hoodie. Another younger woman who seemed to actually be dressed professionally for a 4.5 star dining, kept pulling her mask down. Her mask was mostly down when around her other coworkers, not so much when she was around customers. But when she would poke her head through the window that looked into the kitchen,  in which the freshly made food was sitting on, her mask still remained below her nose and mouth. As we continued to wait to be seated, we overheard a conversation with two of the employees. They discussed that a few tables have not been helped, not even with waters. I told my boyfriend that I didn’t want to waste my money on a place like this, that I’d rather go to the cheesecake factory. As we left, I noticed a clean and already made table located on the patio, as well as the same two tables that we saw from the car, empty and still prepared for customers.< /Text><Rating>1<//Rating>< gmap_id>

<Text>My 1st time there, the manager and the servers where very nice and apologetic for the terrible food and extreme delays.  The egg benedict was below mediocre and the burrito was exrra bland with way over cooked beef cubes.  The egg benedict showed up 25 minutes before the burrito.  I would not recommend this eatery<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Le Citron is a new gem on the Coast Highway in Oceanside. The atmosphere is casual, tasteful and fresh. The food was excellent and our server was upbeat and attentive. Go get yours!< /Text>

<Text>Fantastic salt-encrusted sea bass, prepared tableside by the chef/owner, beautiful presentation with roasted whole tomato, assorted vegetables, and an olive oil-basil drizzle.

My beloved had a shellfish paella, also delightful, Instagram-worthy.

Historic Oceanside home, charming.

Go go go, real French and Moroccan food right here in Oceanside.<//Text>< pictures>

Normandie Style Mussels and Truffle Fries took us back to Cassis France.  Mussels were huge and the white cream sauce was reduced perfectly.  The Paella is a true Spanish version and was outstanding / incredible.  Prime Rib special was great quality and the sauce was excellent.  Beer and Wine only however they carry a rice version of spirits that did the trick.  Outstanding service, very friendly and attentive .  Only thing we expected was incredible bread, alas, we got pita.   Doesn’t matter, glad that was the only thing.  We plan on being frequent customers.  Glad we have this awesome place in Oceanside.< /text>

Best teriyaki in a ten mile radius or probably more. Sauce is the perfect meeting grounds of salty, sweet, and umamii. Chicken is grilled well done and is alll dark meat which is the only choice...

Oh and did I mention the most killer soup...</review>

<text>The name is spot on in multiple ways - the rolls are huge, generous, and "rotund", and the fish is delicious enough it could easily help me put on a few pounds. Seriously, every time I eat here I overeat. Seriously fresh fish, awesome and unique roll combs, delicious hot rice bowls, and some of the beef prices in the east bay combine to make this my new go-to spot for sushi. It's been an amazing find to help get through this Covid lock down. 10/10 would recommend.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>After going here for years, I am sad to say I won't be going back. Pictures are of what are supposed to be salmon sushi but the meat has so many different colors of "salmon" meat going on that I don't feel safe eating it. Plenty of other sushi places... Good bye Fat Fish, my first true sushi love.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCrEa3YzhjUzqOpTAuKzwgEelLya-3rVPgqajA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHPHWvPrcJECx4zn5KOtTO0ONdp_oPkKto7MjZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv0RmMYK-3u8t2vLauGmSbywdd3jxppBXuWUT7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808f8fd42d04ed1b:0x69e7caa73e410a54< /gmap_id></record>

This is my go to lunch sushi spot. They open at 11 am so you can order ahead. The fish is always fresh the rolls are good size. Some times its really busy so you'll have a longer wait than expected< /Review>

I order the Lion King roll. I was not a fan of it and would not get it again. The people working at the restaurant where very nice. Customer service was great. I would give it another try but this place would not be my first choice for sushi.</Text>

Love this place. Our 2nd time here. 1st I tried items 68 n 69. Loved both of it. Today I tried number 60 "Heart Attack" it's also yummy. The prices are decent very affordable. The place is a little small but the owner was very accommodating.  Asked if we wanted to move up to the booth eventhough it's just me n Edd. Definitely be a favorite sushi place  I will definitely come back< /text>

The service is a hit or miss sometimes the waitress/cashier can be really friendly and sometimes kind of rude, depending on who it is.The inside Could use some redesigning and some deep cleaning. I find it a little odd also how they have their “office table” with all the paperwork and the lap top right in the entrance of the restaurant, I would recommend them to put it in the back of the restaurant dividing it with a curtain or something of that matter.</review><Rating>3</Rating>< username>

My change was a dollar something and she only gave me my change. My girlfriend only got water in her cup and knowing the girl at the register ripped me off for a dollar I checked my receipt and she charged me for two extra sodas and I told my girlfriend I wasn’t happy and I didn’t want to confront the young lady because I might get mad so my girlfriend went up there and the other girl was at the register and my girlfriend told her about the mistake and the girl who handled my transaction told the other girl in Spanish that my girlfriend got a bottled water in Spanish and that she seen her well my girlfriend speaks Spanish so she told her that she didn’t and the girl was only going to refund one drink but refunded two. My girlfriend didn’t even mention the dollar I was shorted. I was not Even going to mention it to my girlfriend until I seen the receipt. Food was good but I expect honesty when it comes to my money especially when I spend just shot of 40 dollars 😔< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>So sevice is everything but great food saved this place from getting a lower star rating. Food is very good and fresh. I would recommend eating here. The only thing is i waited till our food came out to ask for my beer. Im used to having it brought to me. She pointed at a fridge. I asked her so what am i supposed to do? She said oh, ill get it. Im still not sure if i was supposed to get my own beer? I really enjoyed the sushi and so did the rest of my party. So, next time i go, ill ask about the beer. Maybe ill update this review at the time. Don't let my review discourage you. Its great sushi.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This has been my ultimate favorite place to come and sit down or take out.

Service and food is Delisious!!!

Very good pricing for quality sushi

You wont regret it!!!!!!

That miso soup is on hit!!!!!

Lion king, fried CA Roll and the dragon roll are my favorite must tries.

Small and compact but very homey comfy  vibe.

It has definitely gone down in terms of quality. I've had fat fish years before and felt like the quality then versus tonight has significantly changed. The prices are still reasonable however if you enjoy sashimi like I do, you'd probably want to just stick with rolls here or bentos. Affordable considering this was a walk around from my home but for quality of sashimi or nigiri, not so much. Maybe more of the albacore and salmon sashimi but definitely a bummer for the tuna.. you can tell it's the blocked/dyed kind of fish meat that's on the market.<//review>

<Review>I’ve been eating here since maybe 2014, always amazing food for amazing prices with a great staff. Today on my lunch I forgot my wallet at work and didn’t realize till I got there. Instead of walking away without my sushi, they let me take it back to work and call and pay on the phone which saved me such a hassle, very thankful for that.< /Review><name>Richard Blank< /name><resp>None< /resp></record>

< review>
I haven't been to this place for almost 2 years, but what a disappointment it was this time around. Fat fish used to be relatively cheap with decent quality rolls and OK raw fish, now the quality of their rolls (both the taste and presentation), the rice and fish wouldn't even stick together before it's dipped into soy sauce. We also ordered the fried oyster as our appetizer, and I can honestly say it's one of the worst I have ever seen, the bread crumbs covering the oyster were SO thick and hard. At least the person at the counter who took our orders was nice, that's about the only good thing I can say about this visit and I definitely will not be coming back in a long time.<//review>

My favorite sushi restaurant.  Big dishes and not so expensive.   Been going there for years now.  Open all day too, not closed between 2pm-5pm like some other sushi places.< /Text>

I highly recommend this location for some cheap yet good quality sushi. The food here is great and the service is even better. If you want to have a good time with friends and dont want to break the bank. This place is for you.<//review>

<text>Pricing is decent but this place has really gone downhill in the past couple of years. I ordered the papa roll, the baby lobster roll, bay marina roll and the honeymoon roll; the papa roll was without avocado despite it being listed as being part of the roll, and the honeymoon roll was without cucumber. They give you a lot of sushi hoping you won't notice these things so examine your roll before eating it. Also I was happy with the cashier who helped me she was very sweet but the chubby kid who bagged my food creeped me out (and I've heard negative things about him in the past from others) Cashier lady, my tip was for you for being so nice and efficient as always. Chubby kid, my brother has no idea why you hate on him so much but he laughs about it.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Place does look like a Mexican restaurant from outside. Service was good and fast. The sushi itself though didn't quite hit the mark. Rice was not sticky enough and the the Big Cali (deep fried California roll) had a very weird texture: soggy and oily. Super rainbow and pink lady though were very good options. All and all it seems like a hit or miss place.< /review>

Piles of paper stacked in the corner and dust on the ledges. Set up is weird. You order from a board menu, pay, grab your own drinks and sit and wait for your good. They ask for a tip on your receipt even though there's no table service. The young chubby Asian girl taking the orders is rude and messed up my order twice on my visits. Only reason I give this place 3 stars is the delicious  vegetarian rolls and the nice old man.< /review>< response>

Jilliane your review has nothing to do with with the food or of the Fat Fish I have known after three years.  Maybe it made you feel better but it was not fair to slam an establishment for the rude behavior of one or two out of dozens of hard-working, pleasant employees.

The sushi is fresh, large portions with quick, efficient and generally friendly service.
Fat Fish is terrific!< /review>

< Review>
Excellent sushi rolls.  Many are cooked so people that are timid with raw can enjoy also. At least 88 different rolls. Seafood, Deep Fried and Veggie. Also Donburi, Grilled Dishes, Bento Box, Sushi and Sashimi, Appetizers, Salad,  Udon and Ramen. Also Party Platters. The dinning area is small but most people are doing take out. Basically this place is a former very old taco bell building but no matter the food is pretty good.</Review>

I like this place sushi is ok place is kinda cramped and not nice that the restroom is right in front of your table, like litterally you have to move out the way so they can use the restroom. Also a couple of the time ive been there they have messed up our orders confusing tables orders etc.<//text>

Clearly said I want #17, the fat cashier said 14? Ok. And charged me $15 instead of $8.55. Only after I argued it's not what I ordered he changed it.< /review>

The food is here is aight. It's not bad but it's not great. I eat here sometimes when I don't feel like driving to Alameda. The sashimi is good and the 49ers roll is one of my favorite.but don't get it twisted it's raidernation all day . They offer ice and water on a small table which is nice. I appreciate whenever restaurants provide that. I drink alot of water and hate asking for refils lol< /Review>

Have gotten my order wrong twice, but the price and portions have me coming back. First was a regular Philadelphia roll when I ordered a super Philadelphia roll. Yesterday it was getting the all salmon sashimi wrong, then asserting that I got it wrong and charged me an extra dollar. I didn't know the order was wrong until I got home. I was shocked that they got the dollar (actually a dollar ten) and tried to blame me.< /review>

Sashimi was top notch..The salmon teriyaki in the bento box was about 2 or 3 oz.. Very thin.. Over cooked and chewy.. If you stay with sushi rolls.. They are good.< /text>

I have been going to the many sushi restaurants recently and found this place to be very underrated if you want a quick bite or a good sit in meal the food here is exquisite. They are also very honest I left my wallet there overnight with over 100 dollars and put a lot of credit cards and they returned it to me the next day.<//Review>

<Date>1457834772437<//Date><text>This is my favorite local sushi restaurant. Everyone there is really friendly and the service is great. Just know that you come in and order first - tea is free and you have to get your own water and ice (at the water dispenser). So, if you have a large party, scope out the seats before ordering. They have a large selection of rolls; the red lion, pink lady, dynamite, and heart attack arey favorites. The ramen is okay, the bento are great, the udon is good, the tea is free, and the prices for appetizers are reasonable.</text><Name>Emily Pham</Name>< pics>

<Text>Just went there I believe the owner was taking our order, walked away 3 times while taking our order. Then when we finished said they had no more rice?? We couldn't place an order for food even tho the place was packed and not closing for another 40 min. Really disappointed.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< name>

<text>You still really like this place food is good but wait staff going to cook either they're too slow  or unorganized now but the last two times I went there I waited almost an hour after pre-ordering on the phone get my food the last time they forgot to make my face after I called it in and I had to wait and this time I called it in they said about 20 minutes I paid for the meal and waited for about 45 minutes and as I got up to leave some of it though mean that you wanted her money back because of some other problem it's going to take 10 minutes they should say 10 minutes it's going to take the 40 minutes they should say 40 minutes but don't say it's going to take 15 to 20 minutes and then pick an hour that sucks< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
Danny and his team are great!. Val, (front office assistant) was very helpful in scheduling appointments for me. She sure is the backbone of the office. Sarah and Christian (Aides) were also very helpful. They helped me learn the exercises. Danny (the PT) has helped me a lot with the recovery of my injured wrist. In addition to the hands on work, the clinic offers modalities such as a class 4 laser and electrical stimulation. Both of these modalities have helped me a lot as well. The clinic has a lot to offer.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>My husband has been going to Synergy Aquatic Therapy for almost three months now and we could not be happier with Danny and his team. Everyone is friendly, professional and very knowledgeable in their field. My husband has made tremendous progress with his broken hip and femur since he has been going to Synergy. We would highly recommend their services to anyone who needs Physical Therapy. They are simply the best and we greatly appreciate everything they have done to help get him to where he is today!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Great staff. The clinic offers a class 4 laser, which has helped me a lot with my recovery. No other clinic in the valley has a class 4 laser. Synergy is one of a kind!. The manual therapy and exercises have helped improve the range of motion in my ankle. Danny sure is one of the best PT’s in the valley!.<//Text>

<Review>I come here for the Aqua therapy pool and it is awesome. I never knew you could put a treadmill under water. And with the warm water close to body temp I don't really need a warm up period.
I look forward to my therapy days because the staff are very nice. I am always able to get my appts when I need them.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I recently started at this highly innovative facility and from the moment I walked through the door I was greeted welcomed by the front desk staff. My initial intake with Daniel was better then my sessions with my primary care physicians.  I had a tour of the facility and meet with the staff, everyone is very professional and treats each patient with respect. I'm  looking forward to working along side Synergy to regain my strength and mobility.  I've been raving about this place since day one.  Thanks in advance team Synergy.</review>

I had been a frequent sufferer of lower back pain which was been exacerbated by learning to walk after having a stroke. At one point I was on so many pain pills with names I could not pronounce that I was rolling around in my chair looking like a zombie.  I was gaining weight which caused an unhealthy rise in A1C and cholesterol.  My doctor sent me to Synergy Aquatic Therapy and I put away the pills and haven’t picked them up since!<//Text>

I was always treated well, with respect and professionalism.   They also showed me a lot of patience when I would need to reschedule or cancel appointments because of my mobility issues and not having anyone to drive me to my appointments.   I would send my family and friends to this place if they needed aqua therapy.   My therapist and her assistant were amazing, always available when needed and patiently answered even my silliest questions.< /Text>

Couldn't be more grateful, the staff is the best!  Combined with other options that other clinics can't offer such as a heated pool with a treadmill in it, a hyperbaric chamber and class 4 laser!  This place IS the best place to get you back to the activities you want to do while keeping you away from surgery or medications with side effects!< /text>

I am nearing the end of 12 weeks of physical therapy related to a shoulder injury I sustained at work. First off, I want to state that they make dealing with work comp insurance a breeze. The people that deal with such subjects, behind the scenes, are knowledgeable and do their job well.

My experience with the physical therapy portion has been a great experience also.The staff is professional, courteous, friendly, knowledgeable and compassionate. I believe they do indeed care about the wellbeing of their patients and truly listen to any concerns they may have. Danny and Julia are who I have personally dealt with but in short conversations with other staff, I believe these attributes must be company policy!

The routine they have me doing is challenging but I do see progress. I am asked regularly about my progress (or lack of) and if certain excercises are becoming too easy. They tailor the routine as necessary to provide the best outcome.

I have read all of their reviews and do not agree with the negative ones at all, especially about being left sitting alone. Let me explain. In the beginning they spent any amount of time necessary to help me learn the excercises.  Now I show up and do my excercises as I have been instructed. If you do that, they will keep a distant watch over you and correct anything you are doing incorrectly and remind you if you forget one. I actually appreciate not being hovered over quite a lot! I am an adult and am very capable of continuing my daily routine with minimal staff intervention. It actually enables me to keep busy and finish in a timely manner. From what I have seen the pool is monitored constantly. They deserve a higher rating than they have. A disgruntled patient has obviously affected that...unfortunate!

One part of my own routine is that Danny helps stretch and massages parts of my shoulder. He is great! He is thorough yet gentle at the same time. He pushes me to my limits but never goes beyond them. I also like that it is a personal yet professional experience. I am always greeted by my first name and the conversation can be very interesting. He is a very likeable guy!

The facility is clean and well organized. They wipe down each table after every use. It is in a convenient location with easy access. They do have a pool for aqua therapy but my injury doesn't require me to use it so I can't comment on it. They also offer laser treatments to help with pain (ask them for more info) and have started offering CBD products. I finally agreed to have my first laser treatment today and will update this review after a couple days.

All that being said, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great physical therapist. I have been to other places for the same injury and this place beats them all hands down.< /Text>

My son in law was left unattended when he didn't feel comfortable and I was not allowed to sit with him then he was kicked out after years of therapy because she advised him to overdose and also he was always asking for someone to stay and no one would when he would jump off the treadmill on the pool< /Text>

The owner the R.N. tried to overdose me when i showed her what pain meds i was on she advised me to take both .....weeks later.she said i cant have you  looking like that....Was harassed because of my disability by the owner .....disgusting when they dont have patients shower off before entering the pool. That has happened to me and i have seen it several times..  I was left in the pool unattended when i told them i feel unsafe to be alone and i requested many times eventually when my co pay stopped  and i called them out on not makin pts shower off before entering the pool they stop me from coming< /Review>

What impresses from day one is the friendliness and professionalism of the Danny and his team.  I look forward to continuing my treatment program for sciatic nerve pain not only for present pain relief but also to learn skills I can apply to help me maintain an active lifestyle as I grow older.  Every subsequent visit reinforces that I am at the right place for this.<//review>

I am just going to this school, but I can say is the best school I have ever attended. They do give you the average amount of homework, but since I am in 7th grade it seems a lot for me. But they do take serious stuff seriously. I have seen them taking care of stuff happening on school seriously. I recommend to go to this school.< /Text>

Hi I was a sixth grader at Rodriguez and me Waugh always had to a answer me with a attitude and the counselor mr Rodriguez always had to get in my way to class and always made me late to class and he always thought I was doing something bad but I wasn’t doing anything and during lunch I hanged out with my friends and he always told me to leave them alone but I wasn’t doing anything bad to them and he all ways that anything you said in this room is our conversation when I was getting bullied and he told my teachers and my parents and even my friends never go to mr Rodriguez for help he always make everything worse.< /text>

Over my five year experience at this school, while yes it has improved, it is still a horrible experience over all. High school was much easier than this, and this school was just extra more than it is advanced.</review>

<text>Worst school ever! They discriminate those with special needs. My brother has special needs and he attended that school for a month without telling us that they don’t accept kids with special needs! The only reason they kept him was because they knew that they get more money if kids with special needs attend them.</text>< Pics>

Excellent school.  While all the 7-8 graders are on behavior/academic contract, the younger grades have a few knuckleheads mixed in. All the teachers strive for excellence.<//review>

It was good at first but the teachers just have so much disrespect to us and put us through so much pressure with assignments. They give so much Attitude and anger to us just because we missed or didn’t do one assignment. Starting at 7th grade they start to don’t care about the students. And plus they don’t help you with any work. Also, if your going here try not to mess with some kids…</Text>

This is one of my favorite places. Love their food and the service they give. Everyone helps with a smile and they are always making sure everything is ok. They don't have you waiting for service like in many other places. A very family oriented place to go and enjoy a delicious meal!< /Review>

Food was really good. The guacamole was made fresh and the best fresh made tortilla. I had a chili relleno with rice and beans and horchata. My wife had the jalapeno and cheese pupusas with roasted jalapenos and fresca de ensalada.<//Text>

< Review>
We usually go there & they attended well when we did. Went this time, they sat us down & we waited approximately 30 mins just to get chips & salsa + drinks. We ordered our food & we never received it. An hour & a half waiting for food it never arrived so we decided to leave & just pay for the drinks we got. Will never come back again.< /Review>

We have a few favorite servers there who simply ask us if we want the usual order. This is usually done before we even sit down. Food quality is always great and delicious. I would always choose to support this restaurant as opposed to a large chain.<//Text>

Had lunch here after a funeral. Food was delicious but the service wasn't very good.  There were 14 people in our party at 3 different tables. Orders got confused, drinks weren't refilled,  and chips and salsa weren't put out until requested 3 times. I will go there again and hope the service is better.<//Review>

service was outstanding which is unfortunate given the quality of the food. the food was under seasoned or over seasoned to the point that it was inedible. they replaced the food that was inedible free of charge which was nice of them! however, I've been here multiple times & the food is always on either end of bland & over seasoned; never finding itself somewhere in the middle.< /text>

The only thing I asked for and they couldn't even take the time to do that. I won't give a place less stars off of a mistake but come on :(<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I ate here on Thursday, I ordered a torta with asada. I ordered it with no beans and no tomato, what I got on it was the meat, avocado, grilled onion, mayonnaise and a little bit of mustard. I told my wife to torta was pretty good despite the fact that I called my order in and was told 15 minutes, got there in about 13 minutes and still had to sit and wait another 30.
We went back the next day. Friday I ordered the same thing, this time I got completely different meat chopped up instead of sliced like last time then I got guacamole shredded lettuce and that's it. I don't know what the hell happened, but I completely different sandwich.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Warning: The servings at this place are large.  The food was amazing.  Tamales that melt in the mouth.  Mouth watering paupusas.  Amazing rolled tacos.  Great service.  Friendly staff.  A hidden gem in Victorville.   Go, you will not regret it.</Text>

<Text>Omg if you haven't ate here then you are missing out on a experience like no other. Its my go to spot when Mexican food is played out but want something similar. They are called Popusas and originally from El Salvador. A bit pricey so I would go on a Thursday if you want to spend less since they are almost a dollar each. Its so good ill spend a little extra just to get some today!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><user>101859958498909469799<//user><date>1607376050918</date><Name>Eric Amaya<//Name><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

This place has become my husband's & my new favorite spot for to go! Between the Pupusas, Handmade Sopes, Burritos & Carne Asada Fries we enjoy it all =]] Prices are reasonable & the food is decently consistent. Give this restaurant a try! & Don't forget to ask for their spicy red sauce, it's smokey =P</Text>

They require a mask to get in the door to walk to your table. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Our food was ok. The salsa was good, but only first bowl is complimentary. After that its a $1. Pina Colada was good too.</Text>

To be honest, I liked my bean and cheese burrito. But my low rank is for three burrito my husband received which had some unknown substance in it that he couldn't chew or bite or swallow. We couldn't even make out what it was.
Now he's scared to go back.
I do have one recommendation for this establishment and any other Mexican joint in the area.
Please, please, please, if you use lard or any other pork fat in your ingredients... Let customers know. We don't eat pork and it would be nice to see what is being used to avoid getting sick and going against our religious preferences. That's a law suit waiting to happen!!!<//review>

Great place for Salvadorean or Mexican food. The pupusas are fantastic, and so are the margaritas. If you want to try real, authentic Hispanic food, you have got to try this place. Almost anything you order here will come out tasting great! If you go on Friday nights there is live music after 7p.</review>

I have gone in several times and I expect more when the owner is there. All the ladies are wonderful, friendly with great service, but the owner's hygiene is questionable. During covid 19, I called to place an order no answer for this location. So I called the one in hesperia, they tried to find out why the other location was not picking up and took my orde . The guy even called me back to confirm that the order was getting made. When I got there the owner was not complying with the rules to wear a face mask. He packed the food and off I went. Food is ok, if there was another salvadorean place I would rather order from there. I guess you won't find out if I died from it.< /Text>

This place is fantastic. The setting is always festive and the food is fantastic. For some reason I got a cold meal (which was still delicious when I tried it), and they still replaced it quickly. The drinks were large and so you likely wouldn't need more than 2 to get a good buzz going. If you want good Mexican food and aren't afraid to spend to get it, I'd highly recommend this place.< /Text>

<Text>The shrimp burrito is TO DIE FOR GOOD! There's this white sauce that I keep begging Tony (the owner) to give me the recipe for. But he won't. It's like having dinner with your family. They make you feel so welcomed. And the service is just amazing! Go! You will not regret it!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Name>

I did enjoy my time here. The service here was wonderful. I strongly suggest you stay away from ordering a margarita. It didn't taste right, I asked the server what alcohol was used...she said "wine". Who uses win in margarita? Big disappointment. Next time I just won't order that.</Review>

Tony is THE BEST! My boyfriend and I walked in and immediately were greeted with genuine smiles and seated within seconds. Service was welcoming and quite unbelievable! Laura was our server and she was so sweet and caring, she made me feel like I was back home in my country of Cabo Verde. The food was so delicious I actually forgot to take a picture lol. Being a picky eater it’s very difficult to find places I can feast for a reasonable price, but Pancho’s has such a great variety of food, spice and flavor that I ate a full plate of premium fresh nachos I could taste, a perfectly made fish taco and a lime margarita that was the best margarita I’ve ever had in my life! Wow, what an experience. We’ll DEFINITELY be coming back! Muitu Obrigado! ❤️</text>

AND everytime there's this guy invading our meal trying to sell candy bars.... He sets his candy bars right on the table and won't take NO for an answer. I suppose I go there because it's convenient following a long long wait at the DMV.< /Review>< pictures>

I had a couple of wonderful oyster shots at Pancho's in Victorville. Juicy, sweet oysters and the sauce they came in was simply delicious. Not to mention the sexiest presentation possible. Good company for a cold beer or a couple of tequila shots. Mmm .::. another reason to come back for the caldo de patas to recover.</review>

Such a disappointment with my michelada. It was so warm so I asked for more ice and that just made it watery. I hate wasting money. I didn't even finish it.< /text>

The place smelt like sewage and it was expensive. The service was ok, that's the only reason I gave it two stars. Also, there's no outside drinks or food allowed.</text>

<Review>I always eat there when I have to go to the dmv. Today I ordered 2 pupusas, normally they are good, but today both were really bad, some parts were under cooked and the chicharon tasted spoiled I almost gaged and didn't eat it. I got up went to the cashier paid my bill and walked out. I didn't complain or returned them because I don't like doing that but if I ever go again I just won't order pupusas any more.</Review><rate>2</rate><userid>102221363515890416695< /userid>< Resp>

Best place for Mexican/Salvadorian food in the H.D. Hands down. No matter who we bring to eat here, they have ALWAYS gone back and BROUGHT THERE FRIENDS OR FAMILY. What else is there to say. DROP THE MIKE. ♠️.</text>

It wasn't horrible but definitely wasn't great. Pretty sure the burrito I got had plain white rice in it, and I'm 100% sure my wife's was plain white rice and had no beans, literally just rice and guac with lettuce.<//Review>

<review>Today the food was not so good, I  think that the cook who does the cooking M-F was off. The service was slow as well. I don't know what happened but everyone has a bad day and today was it.</review>< Pics>

Oysters were bad and when i told the workers they said no they're good and didnt want to exchange for better ones. Waiters were rude about the stituation. I spend over $150. I was not asking for my money back or anything like that just wanted them to give us something different.  Rate service 0 .<//Review>

This is our favorite restaurant ever! Love the food, love the staff! I can't believe the customer who complained about being rushed through her meal when she sat at someone else's reserved table. What do you expect? Any way, we know to show up early enough to get seating and finish our meal before the reservations start showing up for the entertainment. Common sense. I recommend this place over any other.< /text>

<Review>It's a family owned restaurant and the service is  good and the staff is very friendly. The munuedo is excellent. That what I order most every time. Tony the owner is a very congenial person and friendly. The chorizo and eggs breakfast plate is really good to. I also like thier home made tortillas. I would like to see them put lingua on the menu.<//Review>< Pictures>

Order a burrito with no sour cream. When my burrito finally comes out I take a bite and there's sour cream in it. The owner told me it's cheese like I'm stupid and don't know the difference between cheese and sour cream. This place as went down and I will never come back.< /Review>

Amazing food, great atmosphere. Whether just with my sweetheart or the whole family (8ppl), they mail it. Try the Galliano India, more than enough for 2! I preferred the dark meat< /Text>

Ok... let's be honest, it's hard to find a good plate of Chilaquiles in the high desert to remind you of the home cooking you had growing up..ive had my fair share of some rather bad interpretations of chilaquiles, from soggy oily tortillas to hard tortillas chips with some sort of a mysterious red sauce. I'm gonna skip the whole essay step by step review to just say .... very good home made chilaquiles with an over easy egg and I added the carne Asada on top(my way of eating them) and the reason I gave 5 stars is because they use Cotija cheese on this plate. NOT CHEDDAR CHEESE BUT COTIJA...I appreciated the details. Enjoy.<//text>

The salsa was delicious. The handmade corn tortillas were incredible. I had the alambres it was spectacular. We also ordered the queso fundido it was a bit on the greasy side. The only negative thing I can say about this establishment is that the wait staff took a million years to get to us and were not very attentive.< /text>

<text>Very nasty food, slow service and dirty place.
I order pupusas, and I got some kind of tortillas with extra grease. The server was coughing all over the place with out covering her mouth. Nobody ask me why I didn't eat the food or anything else. I got up, paid and left.
I will never go back to that place.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c36437affdc85f:0xe9df84d9a814a71b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Been going here for years! But today they really dropped the ball! I was was served raw meat in my burrito on top of that the meat quality isn't the same as before every bite has a chunk of fat and the meat that doesn't have any fat is super tuff.</Text>

Your review is spoiled brat temper tantrum childish at best, and ridiculous to say the least.  :/

I've been coming to this restaurant for years. The food is da bomb. Everything I have ordered here is yummy. Even in S. California, Its usually hard to find Mexican restaurants like this that have genuine Mex food flavor. This restaurant is an exception. If the owners could find a way to put this restaurant somewhere in West L.A, they'd have so much business, there would be lines around the restaurant. Avoid the corporate Mexican chain restaurants, go to Pancho's.....way better.

Their recipes come from private home made sources

The service is not the greatest, but who cares? You want something? Just ask. It feels like family here.

They have live entertainment on the weekends and it packs the house.

The fountain drinks could be of better quality (Jamaica), but its not a problem.

<review>(Translated by Google) I did not like ..... the waitress was sweeping when we arrived, she said ..... feel, wherever they want ..... we sat for a while was the waitress with us, I arrive with the cutlery and napkins; but he did not wash his hands before attending us, that's unhygienic we left the restaurant we said we do not want anything thanks.

< review>
(Translated by Google) I bought 2 giblets to take away, it took me a long time to deliver my order, when I got home I realized that one did not have any grain, I told the restaurant by phone to tell him that they had not added grain and he told me that it was Ivan to give me grain in a glass. I arrived and they gave it to me in a small glass and the waitress thought I was lying to ask for more grain. They did give me but it was in a small glass and I don't see much of it, and when I got home, the menudo was already cold and the grain seems to have been given to me from a freshly opened can, I added it to my menudo but I got another bad taste. The truth is very bad experience and it was not worth the 22 dollars I paid, I will not go to that place again.

(Original)
Compre 2 menudos para llevar, me tardaron mucho para entregarme mi orden,cuando llegue a mi casa me Di cuenta que uno no tenía nada de grano, le able por teléfono al restaurante para decirle que no me abian echado grano  y me dijo que fuera que me Ivan a dar grano en un baso. Llegué y me lo dieron en un vasito pequeño y la mesera pensó que yo estaba mintiendo para pedirles más grano. Si me dieron pero fue en un vasito pequeño y vien poco, ya cuando llegue a mi casa el menudo ya estaba frío y el grano parece que me lo dieron de una lata recién abierta, se lo eché a mi menudo pero agarro otro sabor malo. muy mala experiencia la verdad y no valió los 22 dólares que pague, no volveré a ir a ese lugar.<//review>
