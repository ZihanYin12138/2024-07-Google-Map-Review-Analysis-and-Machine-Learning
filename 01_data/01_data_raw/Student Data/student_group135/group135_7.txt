<user>109760316034979349733<//user><review>Definitely won’t be coming back to this one will go out my way to go to the other one. Not only is there no customer service. they don’t even ensure that you have all your food before you leave there drive-through. We asked the lady if that was everything and she said yes and of course when we got home we’re missing a whole meal three piece tender.< /review><GmapID>0x80c35571c8b39aeb:0x2109a47257e74dfb< /GmapID></record>

The wait was ridiculously long. Everything is overpriced. The food was not good. The chicken strips were gross and the ranch is even worse. The bread that came with our meals is a plain piece of toast. They could at least slap some garlic butter or something like they have done at other dairy queens. I worked at Dairy Queen over 20 years ago and the food was delicious. I would not recommend the food at this location. The ice cream was fine, but I don't think you could mess that up. I will only be back when I am craving a blizzard.< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Took my daughter out for some delicious Dairy Queen but ended up getting handed someone else’s food but I gave it back cuz I orders two royal blizzards. When I got home I tasted my royal rocky road and it tasted like a snickers. So I drove back when I got to the window the manager “Raeleen “ wasn’t happy that I brought her product back she told me I got the right blizzard which she offered to remake one after being confrontational. I just came back to get what I paid for. She gave me a new one not even filled to the top. She was so petty I’m sorry you have this person representing your company December Herrera.< /review>< pictures>

<review>I was not impressed first I ordered like 4 drinks and the girl at the window didn't have the sense to put them in a cup holder. As the items came up she was just handing them out the window no bags not even a do you want sauce nothing. Then I ordered a six piece chicken meal she gave me a four pieces. I will definitely not be eating there anymore but I will still be buying the ice cream I loved there hot fudge Sunday.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This place is almost always very busy and it's kind of pricey. Dairy Queen's ice cream is good, and the staff hasn't messed up any of my orders so that's a plus!</Review>

<username>Palma Espinosa< /username><Text>I looked forward to the new Dairy Queen. My first experience was not good. I took a bite out of the chicken sandwich. It tasted bad. I opened it up to find brown, rotten lettuce. I noticed the owners car in the parking. How can a person not realize how bad the lettuce was. I will go elsewhere.< /Text><userid>116073607075166700644< /userid></record>

It would be awesome if the phone number on the website was updated/correct. Just came back from getting a banana split with  baby potions of soft serve and got triple charged for chocolate. Would have gotten strawberry and chocolate toppings but they were out of strawberry.<//Review>

<Text>We went there 4 times looking for there Shrimp Basket. Each time was a Thursday night. First 2 times the girl said "We ran out". The second 2 times they said "Fridays only". Sent a message to their corporate office with no response but when we went back this last Thursday the Shrimp Baskets off the menu. The last visit the girl didn't give me back my VISA card. Had to cancel a lot of auto pays.

Update 04/09/21: The late reply to this is inacceptable. We sent a complaint at the website weeks ago with no reply. If your representing DQ YOU should be reaching out to the franchise owner, not us. That's NOT how to run a company. DQ will no longer get our our friends and family.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I have never left a review before but this issue really bothered me. I did a order on the Dairy Queen app, paid for it and everything hoping I would be able to just go to the door and pick my order up but instead there is a sign saying for mobile orders to pick up in Drive-Thru. What is the point of paying ahead of time if I still have to wait in the long line?? Very disappointed, you guys really need to update your app so people know that you still have to go through the Drive-Thru to pick up order. Waited over a half hour just to get our blizzards and they were all melted, definitely not going back again.</Text></record>

Went here two weeks ago after skiing for ice cream with my kids. Drive thru was the only option and it took 30 minutes.

Decided against my better judgement to give it another try last night, hoping that things would be different. It was actually slower and longer - 45 minutes in the drive thru!

There's no excuse for this - obviously they are very understaffed. In n out gets twice the amount of cars through their drive thru's in half the time or less. Need to figure out how to run a faster operation - this is a FAST FOOD joint after all.

Two stars purely for the great ice cream - hard to find fault there - nothing beats a blizzard, in my opinion. But I will go to other DQ's in the future, never coming to this one again.<//text>

This seems to be a brand new business. I was happy to see a drive-thru DQ. Not a long wait but when I did put my order in, it took them a very long time to process my card and I was starting to get nervous. Once my card was given back to me they flipped my blizzard and it started leaking from the lid they put on it. I took it they did not give me any napkins. As I was about ready to leave they told me that they had accidentally charged the car behind me and now needed to give me credit on my card. That was very upsetting. I could tell that the girl at the window was new and she was probably being trained but I ended up getting the raw end of the deal. when they gave me the ice cream I noticed they have put a lid on the small Blizzard and it was squished down so much that you could not possibly open the lid they put the spoon inside the cup through the lid and so I couldn't take the lid off and my car without making a mess and I couldn't take the spoon off either.I was going to go through the drive-thru and give it back but instead I had to figure out a way to tear off some of the lid and ended up spooning it out little by little. I was a bit disappointed to say the least. I have a dairy allergy and this was going to be a treat that I should not have picked up and then to top it off have all this happen. Encouragement not to come in and save myself from the hassle. I asked for a turtle pecan blizzard and all it had was pecans but normally they put in some sort of chocolate syrup that hardens and it didn't have it. Boohoo boohoo.<//Review>

<review>Bad service,  part of order missing

Bad food, cold hamburger. Salty, tasteless fries

Slow service. One half hour wait

High prices. $4.77 for a large Sunday the size of a small coffee cup.  59 cents extra for  a very small amount of peanuts. 59 cents extra for a dab of whipped cream..

Vets 10 percent discount was .95 cents on a $20.00 receipt. You figure it out

Disappointed customer.  We really looked forward to this DQ opening in our neighborhood since we loved DQ where we moved from. This was our second visit and there was no improvement. There will be no third visit!</review><GmapID>0x80c35571c8b39aeb:0x2109a47257e74dfb< /GmapID><user_id>107073547522912425280</user_id><time>1609693284107< /time><name>Larry Vizard</name><response>{'time': 1609771845838, 'text': 'Thank you for the feedback, Larry.

It's a very long wait because the only thing open is the drive thru. Besides the very very long wait, I have no complaints about the ice cream quality itself.< /Text>

Had a great experience! Love this store, my third visit. Malicia helped me with getting a better pair of shoes for the rainy weather and was very helpful with everything I needed. Great service. I bought the Alterex dress shoes.   Thanks Lucky Feet Shoes! 😊👍<//text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Where to start on this horrible experience! We went in to purchase Hoke One One foot wear and were sold used shoes that were returns with out advising us that the shoes were returns. Within a week the shoe side seems failed and we returned to the store to exchange them or return the shoes and we were told that we could not return the shoes because they were worn and we would have to take up with the manufacture. The store manager stated that these shoes were returns and that the customer expressed some concern in regards to the seems. I asked why was that not told to us prior to us purchasing the shoes and why was that customer allowed to return the shoes? She blew me off and told there was nothing they could do. Well, I decided to write this review to hold the store accountable for their deceit & horrible customer service!

I love your store. I called the store before going in to see if there was anything they could do to allediate my foot pain. Well Sarah Ramos answered my call, she was professional, and helphful. I explained the discomfort and pain that I was going throught. She envited me to come in, she knew exectly what I needed. I left the store very happy. I will recommand this store to my friends. Great customer service. I have been shoping at Lucky Feet for a couple of years now, and its GREAT!!   Willa B.<//text>

Manufacturers defect your referred back to them to deal with it. Even if it was sold wrong in the first place because the person sized you wrong, your out all that money! I can buy a pair of Shoes for new balance and orthopedics insoles and save a few dollars or better yet go to Nordstrom Rack and buy Brooks shoes for 50% off. Don’t get ripped of by this sleazy company that just cares about you long enough to make a sale. Forgets about you as soon as you walk out the door, bad customer service! They need to put themselves in customers shoes and see how they would like to be treated.</Review>< user>

I am So Lucky that Annette was there to show me the way to Very Lucky Feet!!  She explained why my feet hurt So Much and how to correct the issue with GOOD Shoes and Proper Arch Support!
My Feet and Back were miserable being So Off Balance and I did not even know why until Angel Annette let me see for myself!

Had a great experience today with Annette at Lucky feet. I've been struggling for almost 2 years with foot and lower back pain and now I know why. She was able to explain to me and show me why, and do something about it, and all in under 10 minutes. You strongly recommend check this place out and getting a diagnostic.< /Text>

<review>I was not sure what is the best for running shoes , but I heard about Brook brand .
We went to this store to check out
The young white sales lady was so much knowledgeable about feet’s anatomy and helped us to choose the RiGHT perfect shoes for us

This lady is very professional and kind and she sized our feet scientifically by store chart And helped me and my husband to choose the perfect fit !

We both got Brook running shoes and this shoes is the “dream come true runninh shoes. “
It is so light n comfy n wide n amazing.  I feel like that my feet can breathe air n I love it very much.  !!!   Don’t go to big 5 but go to store like this !!< /review>< Date>

I bought several pairs of shoes costing hundreds of dollars. I get home to find out they did not give me the shoes I purchased. When I call to complain they told me it was my mistake and I need to come back in and correct it. Not even an apology for bad service!< /Review>

I am an OLD emergency room nurse, so it is very important what I put on my feet, both on and off the job.  Most of the shoes I wear now have been purchased at Lucky Feet.  Not only do they have a variety of styles that make my feet feel great, the sales staff, (especially Nichole) are so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable, they make shopping there a real pleasure!</Review>

<Review>Our experience here was absolutely amazing! When we first got there it seemed small, but the menu looked good, so we decided to try it. That was the best decision we could've made. The food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. The appetizers and dinner were spread out, which made it easier to enjoy all the food. Our server, Ben, was amazing. Overall, it was a great experience, and I can't wait to go back.<//Review><user_name>Rachel Kent< /user_name><Rating>5</Rating>< user_id>

<text>My hubby always said this is one of the best pizzas in the county.

Today, we finally went there. My first visit, and his first visit after 4 years. On the way to the restaurant, I read a review saying the sauce and dough was bland, my heart sank a bit. I told my hubby, ‘we will be the judge!’

And now I have to agree with the previous review. The sauce wasn’t just bland but also watery. The only flavour that the pizza had was the ingredients they put there when you tasted them individually... they actually didn’t blend in that well.

The key to the pizza is the sauce and the dough apart form the ingredients. I guess 4 years ago was the time it’s awarded one of the best pizzas in the US. Sadly, I couldn’t taste the same flavour anymore.

To be fair, the salad was quite good! And the IPA as well!<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhE8IuS9ovuU_hq1Uc_shFEp7LIlwicdO5I0Yq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_UNwMg0tqugVDQHUo5-4IMa5J6YQh_VWc2MVn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIelkUX81QDPFaZD-VjbcvaQO9SSaneTP59-B2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Always used to go there for the food and good pizza but haven’t been there in a while, my daughter Ordered 4 pizzas to go yesterday by phone. Opened the boxes and the sizes were personal pan pizza size around 8”inches, and $ 100.00 later including the tip.
Pizza is very good but you guys need to step it up on the sizes..<//Text>

Best Italian Pizza I have had outside of Naples. The cheese is made fresh and in house! The chef speaks fluent Italian. Where else do you get pizza with such fresh ingredients? A true gem!<//Review>

This place has gone down from good to barely acceptable.  The service is still good  (hence the 2 stars, otherwise i would have given none)
the pizza is terrible, the dough is dry  (clearly didn't have enough time to rise and rest before  baking it), the tomato  sauce, mozzarella etc are almost  flavorless, the crust was overcooked , they  put the mortadella in the oven , but  don't pre cook the  mushrooms  (either fry or Sautee')  to bring out their flavor, although i was guaranteed by the waiter that they were sautéed<//Review>

Outdoor patio dining open during pandemic.

Still my go to for neapalitano style pizza in orange county, but recently has dropped a but in overall quality. Crust is not as airy and crunchy as it used to be.< /Text>

Here on vacation and stopped in for lunch. The food was amazing! Easily in my top 5 best pizzias! If you are looking for a good wood fired pizzia, this is the place! Service was great as well! I will definitely return when back in the area.< /review>

<text>1 star for a good tasting margherita pizza.

The service here is horrible. When we entered we stood for a few minutes waiting for a server to acknowledge us in this tiny restaurant. When We were finally told we could just sit anywhere the waiter came up to us like 15 minutes later and We ordered a margherita pizza and the bake fusilli. It took us 45 minutes to get our orders. the restaurant wasn't even full at the time. I noticed other tables were given bread except us. We were starving by the time the food finally got to us. Pizza was great. Fusilli was horrible ...it looked like a Mac n cheese, way too saucey, had no flavor and had 2 bits of sausage in it. This cost $14. And I know, you're saying why did u get pasta at a place known for their pizza...in the downtown location I've had their pasta and it's delicious. She also never came in between our order to update us that the food would be a little bit longer to give us a chance to I dunno order an appetizer or something. They seemed like the y get a lot of to go orders and it seemed like their number one priority.<//text>< Pics>

Amazing pizza!  Took my coworkers here and everyone loved it.  Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed.  It's cool to see Julio making your pizza right in front of you.  I highly recommend Michael's Pizzeria!< /review>

Roasted vegetables make for a nice light starter and the margherita was very good even with the dough in the center a little soft.</review>

< Review>
I have been many times in Michael's pizzeria. I was there on 01/04/20 for dinner. Was not very pleased with my pizza since the prosciutto pizza was great but I didn't know the prosciutto was not cooked with the pizza. Our server was great but the restaurant is always too cold, that it made it uncomfortable to even eat. I asked the waitress to stop the fans which she did but it was still cold.  I hope if I visit again they make the place more enjoyable.< /Review>

First time visit to Michael's, my friend from Italy was leaving town, and it was recommended to stop by; I've been to Italy twice, and their pizzas are on another level. I tried one of their signature pizzas and was very impressed; I felt like I was back in Italy, presentation, taste; texture was perfect. I spoke with the chef and waiter and gave them my two thumbs up. if you can't make it to italy; it's the next best thing. You will not be disappointed. 😊</review>

The Gateway of Indian pizza is by far the best which includes tandoori chicken, fresh crab meat, artichoke hearts, and mozzarella on cilantro-mint Chutney! Delicious! If you are in the Houston area, this stop is a must. They also have a great selection of craft beers.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Michael's makes the best margherita pizza. But the service here has been going downhill. Last time I was there we waited 45 minutes for our meal even though there were only 2 other parties seated. I later noticed that they had been preparing two huge take out orders but never bothered to tell us. Didn't even see the server for those 45 minutes. If you are craving a good Neapolitan pizza just go to the downtown location.</Text>

<review>I'm from back east and this is some of the best brick oven pizza I've found thus far on the west coast. They need to crisp their pizza's a bit more but otherwise they are outstanding. Margarita Monday (free margarita pizza with purchase of another) is a steal. They also have a nice selection of local brews on tap.<//review><user_name>Hannah Janeway< /user_name><user>107365041246504460492<//user>< Rating>

<review>Delicious pizza and salad, very friendly wait staff. Parking can be a little difficult though. Also FYI there is another Michael's right next door. It is the same owner, but a very different restaurant. The one next door is an upscale Italian place. We ended up there first on accident.</review>< Pics>

This is easily the best pizza place in Long Beach. They make authentic Napoli style pizza cooked in a wood-fired oven. Fresh, simple ingredients mostly made in house make for an excellent meal. There is a rotating selection of good wine that pairs well with whatever you're in the mood for. They also rotate through several taps of decent craft beer. The staff is all friendly and helpful.<//Text>

Took it out. I had to order from the door and the line was 1.5 hr to get into the restaurant. I wish the menu would not have been small print on chocolate brown paper and I wish I would have taken more time ordering. I defiantly like the crust, the cheese, but would have liked to have sauce. Not that the pizzas no not have sauce; but this one didn't. I am a sauce guy. Now the calzone I ordered was great - I would have liked more sauce; but great. I'll give it another try. I need to become more familiar with the place.<//Text>

<text>A very hip vibe for an old school style pizzeria. Came during brunch on a Sunday and nothing says brunch quite like $3 mimosas and live music. We ordered a good amount of food and enjoyed all of it. We were struggled on ordering because we wanted to try everything. Well, there’s always next time. All the plates came out beautifully and had a nice rustic style. The owner was very attentive and came by our table a few times to check on the food quality and exchange pleasantries. It’s nice to see owners personally involved with their businesses. End the meal with a slice of tiramisu and you will walk away a happier person.</text>< Pictures>

Not your average pizza place...sophisticated but casual at the same time. Great wine list and pizza like you have never had before. Only a $10 corkage fee and an awesome wine store, The Bottle Shop, right down the street.</text>

My wife and I had dinner there May 11th. Server was kind and helpful. My wife and I both ordered pizza. To be completely honest... I'm shocked for how expensive it was for a mediocre pizza. I ordered the pizza with stracciatella, mortadella and pistachios..a helpful hint for the cooks.. Try squeezing out the stracciatella cheese with some cheese cloth first before placing on the pizza. My pizza was completely soggy and drenched in milk and fell apart. Flavor was good but I could care the cook could care less about presentation. Needless to say.. We're not putting this on our recommendations list.</review>

Its simply amazing!!
The chef was super sweet & offered us a complementary salad just so I could try the different flavors!! They made the pizza exactly how I wanted it.
I found this pizza place by coincidence and is now my number 1 place!!<//Text>

Unfortunately, we were the only table in the restaurant for the first 30-40 minuets. 4 top. The bread was awful- dry and felt liked it needed to be baked or add a pound of butter. Really not good even heavily dipped in olive oil. We ordered 2 pizzas and 2 pastas. Over 35 mins later we had the pizzas. An hour later we had the pasta. We had to ask for it go and it seemed to be 1 ordered package as two. Pizza was ok, although not crispy or super hot. The staff comp’d the wine and offered dessert, but it was a little too late since we were the ONLY ones in the restaurant for quite some time.<//review>

Feels like they've lost a step. Pizza isn't as flavorful as it used to be, particularly the dough and crust. Olive oil was flavorless. Hopefully they'll return to form, as this was once the best pizza in Long Beach.< /Review>

Very good, but it is a bit overpriced. I've been a couple of times now and I've had good experiences, but this last time my sister's carbonara pizza was a bit too greasy and salty. Plus, the white wines they recommended seemed way too light to hold up to the strong flavors of the pizza, so I'm not sure how good their pairing suggestions really are. They did have a pretty good beer selection, though, and you can't go wrong with beer and pizza! I had the seafood pizza, which I thought was perfection. Clams, octopus, mussels, shrimp and scallops in a zesty sauce on that chewy wood-fired crust, yum. Even though it was a chilly night the warmers kept us nice and toasty on the patio. It's a little too spendy for me to visit regularly, but for a special occasion it fits the bill.</text>

I've only had the pizza, but it's delicious.True that it's a little pricy but if you like margarita pizza, go on Mondays where you get two for the price of one.

We ordered a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms, olives, mozzarella, a couple other things I'm forgetting, with a tomato based sauce and an arancini appetizer. The food came out quick. A little too quick, but a thin crust pizza and a handful of fried rice balls shouldn't take long, really. The pizza was fine. Traditional thin crust, cooked in an open fire stone oven, made with fresh quality ingredients. Unfortunately, it was slightly burnt in some spots on the underside and very soggy towards the middle. Flavor was good, but just not executed perfectly. I was even more disappointed in the arancini. They were not freshly fried, it seemed as if they were fried at some point and re-heated in the oven....a travesty. They were VERY crumbly and would not hold their form and the flavor was un-inspriring.

Our waitress was great. Very friendly and attentive. The hostesses were....interesting. I don't see myself going back to Michael's, nor suggesting it to anyone else, unless they're going for brunch to load up on cheap mimosas, maybe that'd make the experience more bearable.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Got one item i was rather disspleased with how the size fit. Used the return shipping in the same box it came in and had the charge back to my card promply after sending it back.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>joshua lefrancois<//user_name>< Date>

<text>The store is really big. They had a very good collection. I just could not stand in for a long time as they were not turning on the AC when it was 85 outside. Good location in downtown.<//text>< pictures>

Pretty small compared to some other Lofts I've been to, but this one is in a great location convenient for anyone living/working in downtown San Francisco. Wish they had a bigger selection! The two associates there were very busy folding clothes and helping customers while I was there, but I prefer to be left alone while shopping anyway.<//review>

<text>If only I had a steady income, I would actually shop instead of window shop.  There are sales in this store, unfortunately by the time I know what goes on sale, the good stuff is already taken.  Super cute dresses, tops, and accessories.  Too bad I was looking at a dress and was ready to try it on, only to find it was $398!!! OOOOk......</text>< Pictures>

I love this store. It's location couldn't be more convenient for me to stop off as I'm headed to catch the ferry or a bus. It seems like they typically sell out of the larger sizes quickly here.  I can always find a 4 or a 6, but not my size (just add a 1 in front).  But that's ok. The staff is very friendly. If they don't have my size, I can always order it online. At least I had the chance to see the fabric and cut in person and up close.  I hope they never close this location!<//text>

Well I made the appointment for my son who apparently missed it. SO his ONE chance to get in for a pedicure by a salon that came so highly recommended he totally blew. SO now I get to clean up his mess AGAIN!! HOpefully he'll be able to get his own appointment at a premium(if they give him one) and fix the issue with a large tip!!!</review>

Consistently good. Best to make an appointment if possible. Introduced me to powder dips which are better for my nails and last three weeks.</Text>

Pros: Decent Mani/pedi and open on Sundays (not many salons in the area are)

Cons: took a really long time, and had to wait despite having an appointment. Didn't want to take credit cards, even though they don't advertise as cash only.</Text>

<Review>I love this place, and they love my dog. Which makes it easy to leave when you know they are taking great care of your pet.  The staff and owner are always welcoming.  They recognize my puppy the minute he walks in and greets him immediately.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this place.</Review>< pics>

From walking inside to going outside, the staff and the environment made me feel good about leaving my 5 months old puppy in their hands. Webcam feature is fantastic where I was able to work and occasionally see his activity at the same time which game me a peace of mind. We will return 😀</review>

The staff are so friendly and helpful. The waiting area is so clean and inviting. We had an amazing experience. Our little dog loved her time!   I also appreciated the phone app and being able to check in to see her adjust well made me feel good. Thank you for all you do. We can't wait to come back for more days of play and the overnight stays.<//Text>

I took my dog there for a two tonight stay as usual, when I picked him up I noticed he had a severe head tilt I ended up messaging the vet later on during the night. The next day I called to see if anything was wrong and if they had noticed wrong anything wrong with my dog and that's when they notified me that they sprayed my dog and a couple other dogs with a water hose to break up a fight. I was not notified of this until I called and told them that he was at the vet with a severe ear infection and the only thing they told me when I picked him up with that he ripped up his pillow. I then asked about the policy because when I first initially brought my dog to the place, I was told I have been notified if anything that happens. This happened the first night he arrived and they said they check to see your Sunday night and I started noticing the head tilt Monday and it was clearly noticeable when I picked him up Tuesday. Lisa who I assume is the manager then proceeded to tell me that she will take care of the vet bill and to send her over the invoice and sorry for the inconvenience. I sent over the invoice two weeks ago.<//Text>

This place is great. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. It is very stressful to leave the furry kids behind, but knowing that they are in great care is awesome. Having that piece of mind, make the time go by fast. Thank you Camp Bow Wow for taking care of  my little ones. You guys are the best! I see you (in the cameras provided) interacting with the dogs all the time and giving the love throughout the day. Truly a great place!</review>

I am very pleased with Camp Pow Wow. They took care of our dog in a professional way. The best thing about Camp Pow wow is that the dogs have plenty of time to move about, and not be in a cage all day, like other national chains.</Text>

Camp Bow Wow is Beyond Awesome! I recently had my dog there May 06-09.. and I was concerned as they were just opening up again on May 05, because of Covid-19... well he had friends to play with (as I checked on him via the web cam)... the drop-off & pick-up are Covid safe and it was easy to do... staff is always great at Camp Bow Wow Temecula! I paid via phone before my dogs stay and I also made sure camp staff had his up-to-date vaccine records before going to camp. My dog was well cared for and he was totally exhausted for three days after I picked him up... so I know he had a Great time! Thanks Camp Bow Wow for the GREAT Care my dog gets every time he is there! So happy you are Open again! :-)< /review>

<review>We love Camp Bow Wow! We love that our dog gets to play with other dogs instead of being locked up all day. The staff is always super friendly and our dog comes backs happy and exhausted. We were in town visiting family and sent our dog to the Temecula location and she loved it, exactly what we have experienced with each Camp Bow Wow. Definitely recommend them to anyone looking for doggy day care, over night boarding, etc.</review></record></dataset><record>

My dog -loves- going here! And his energy gets used up, so -I- love it when he goes here! :P It's expensive, $33 for 12 hrs. But it's a nice treat for once in a while, & I really like that I don't need reservations. I can just decide to take him on the spur of the moment.<//review>

<review>Camp Bow Wow has taken my high-anxiety Rocky to a high-energy-fun, always-playing Rocky. The staff is caring and very skilled to help your fur-baby transition to an environment that is safe. Rocky is so much happier to be in a place that offers positive interaction while I am at work. BTW, It has lowered my anxiety as well.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>We love their all day play product. It is so much better than other kennels where the dogs get an hour or two of exercise a day. The cameras are cool for an occasional peek. We love that there is interaction with other dogs and humans. The occasional timeout for the hyper dogs (ours included) is nice.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I love this place and my dog seems to love it too.   They have daycare,  overnight stays and training.  I've never used the training but have the other services.  Generally you can drop in without an reservation if you're only using the daycare.   At the end of the day my dog is super tired which I love.  My only complaint is she's always seriously dehydrated when it's time to go home.  It happens every time and I'm not sure why.  I'll investigate it next time we go.   I'm glad such a service exists.  I'd hate to board my dog at a place where she's left in a cage all day.  This place is great.</review>

Love this place! Like most people I was nervous leaving my baby with other people and checked out multiple places before sticking with CBW. I bring my puppy Oliver there for both day care and boarding when I am out of town, the second we turn onto the street he starts jumping around because he knows he gets to go play with all of his friends! This isn't the closest puppy day care to my place, but I will drive out of my way to go. The workers all know Oliver when we go and they are all so sweet and awesome! I 100% recommend this place for your fur baby!</review>

the environment is so clean and so organized the staff is unbelievably sweet friendly and always accommodating . They treat my dogs so unbelievably well here and are always concerned for her well-being and her safety .
I highly recommend CBW.
When I walk in my dog poles to get to the back house she’s comfortable and knows all of her friends are waiting behind those doors .
It’s nice to be able to go somewhere I know you have someone to take care of your pets the way you do watch them on the Kim anytime you’d like and know that they are treating your fur baby like a king/ Queen.</Review><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<Review>I was nervous about the camper interview for my 2 puppies. They can be very vocal dogs and tend to get each other riled up. When I arrived camp counselor, Melissa, explained the process and what to expect. I was happy that she took each puppy in separately to see how they could adapt to a large group of dogs independently. They both passed and we were offered the great deals for new campers that were too good to pass up! Melissa and the front desk girl were both very courteous and professional. My pups came home exhausted after their complimentary day at camp. Overall, a great experience and I look forward to taking my pups there again!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Loved Camp Bow Wow!  They had a great interview process that assured me that my dog was in good hands.  Employees monitored the dogs at all times.  I especially love how you can watch your dog on the camper cam.
You can rest easy knowing your dog is spending the day at Camp Bow Wow.<//text>

Rocky LOVES Camp Bow Wow.  He gets excited for Day Camp and when he gets to sleep overnight.  My boy had high anxiety that required medication.  Now that he attends Camp Bow Wow, no more need for medication.  Thank You Camp Bow Wow for employing AWESOME staff!< /review>

My dog loved it!  He didn't want to get back into the car. :P  I feel at ease because 1) There's someone watching the dogs the whole time, 2) There's a webcam I can access the whole time, even from my phone.  I love the fact that my dog can have companionship with other dogs, yet none of them "own the place", so they're all on equal ground -- theoretically. ;) The hours are great, too, because they're not just 9 - 5.  They start early in the morning and go into the evening.  The pick-up time for a full day is flexible, which I love.  I'm so thankful we have one of these in Temecula!<//review>

Charlie's groomer Trina did an AWESOME job with him! He's usually not happy when being groomed, however, Trina took the time to bond with him to ensure a smooth grooming session for both of them. On top of that, Trina gave Charlie the EXACT teddy bear cut we were looking for... No other groomer can seem to get it right! I still can't get over how perfect of a cut it is! Thank you Trina and Camp Bow Wow... Charlie will definitely be a Camp regular!!< /Review>

<review>I filled out the online reservation for the next day and filled out their three page application. They never called me back and never sent me an email. No problem. Went there and they told me “we didn’t call you to get an interview, PLUS we don’t take little dogs.” My dog is 8 pounds. Basically, I was up a creek. Fortunately, I found another kennel a few miles away that was great. But I won’t be back to Camp Bow WOW.</review>< userid>

Our family dog loves this place, the staff is so sweet and helpful. I love that just after one interview and a full day of play, the staff knows our dog's name and can recount her behavior and give us any helpful concerns that might have occured during her daycare stay.< /review>

<Text>Everything! The staff is great and super knowledgeable (which is extremely helpful for all of us first time puppy parents out there) and the facility is amazing! Absolutely love the theme and the fact that there are cameras to watch everything on! I feel really comfortable leaving my puppy there and am so glad they get so much play time rather than being kept in a kennel all day. That was one of my biggest worries. I also love how they offer training classes during your pets stay! That's such a smart idea!! Overall, I give Camp Bow Wow 2 thumbs up!</Text><Name>Amanda Nicole<//Name>< response>

I love how personable the staff is. My Maggie is nearly 15 years old and has had very little socialization with other dogs. The staff was so good with her, reading her behavior very well. They introduced her to other dogs slowly and patiently, and she adapted. I was so impressed with the process. I LOVE the live feed video! Leaving Maggie was harder on me than her, and being able to watch her via live feed was GREAT! It gave me a great sense of peace.<//text>

Best place ever !! Love the video cameras. You can tell these people love dogs. My puppy always comes home tired from playing which is comforting because it means she’s not stuck in a cage all day. Everyone needs to take their dog here !</Review>

Camp Bow Wow has incredibly clean facilities and allows us the awesome pleasure of seeing our Dog's play experience as he gets social time with many other dogs. Our dog is a rescue, initially very shy and terrified of other dogs. Camp Bow Wow exposed him to socialization at just the right tempo to get him playing as if he had always been dog-friendly.< /review>

They have an app that you can pay a small fee so you can see your dogs in the yard if you are too worried about them.

<Review>Always friendly and welcoming service. We can drop by and visit our dogs anytime and can see how they are doing from the lobby monitor. Availability has been good whenever we need to reserve. Our dogs come back happy and seem to love socializing with other dogs in the indoor yard spaces where there is plenty of supervision. I've added some training sessions in the past that help reinforce good behaviors at home.</Review>< Pictures>

We had a great experience at our very first visit to Camp Bow Wow! From the minute we walked in, we were warmly greeted by friendly staff members. They were happy to answer all of our questions and put our mind at ease that our girl was going to be in capable care. We love the flexibility in the schedule for drop off and pick up times as well as the overnight boarding options. And the price is affordable for the level of service and care our dog is receiving. It seems that they really go above and beyond to accommodate their guests as well as have a clean, welcoming environment for all of the pups. We were very happy to watch our girl Remi have such a great time with all of the other campers and how incredibly happy (and tired!) she was at pick up time. We are so glad we found Camp Bow Wow and can’t wait to go back and use their services regularly.< /review>

One star is too much to give them! I have used them Before and never had an issue. This past week I went out of town and had my golden doodle there for 3 days. When I picked him up he seemed happy. I got home and noticed that he was walking and acting strangely. He couldn’t sit down and was looking at his back legs. He walks almost like he is dizzy. His eyes look drugged. His nose is dry and hot. I called to ask if something had happened and they said no. I took him to the vet and he said something is definitely wrong and that it looks as if my dog was given drugs. Also that his nails were cut wayyyy too short! My dog is now in for observation. He won’t respond when we call His name, doesn’t look up or Move at all. This is a dog who is full of energy and happy!

I am furious about this and will be calling tomorrow when they open to talk to the manager about this! This is unacceptable and something clearly was given to my dog while in their care!!!< /review>

Their front lobby is very warm and inviting. It instantly makes you feel at home. The staff was great and walked me through the interview process. I was able to sit back and watch the introductions from a monitor and then got the ok that he passed his first test. I had my pup stay all day since I work full time but I got to check up on him through the Web Cam. I thought this was so cool and gave me piece of mind that he was having a great time. When I picked up my pup he was exhausted from playing all day and the cutest thing was that they gave me a certificate with his picture on it saying he passed. You can tell that the staff truely cares for their "campers" and we will be back for sure!<//Text>

<review>I was really nervous about sending my dog to a new place she's never been but she loved it! The people were really nice and friendly with my dog. They're very observant to any and all incidences that would occur inside the playpen at all times which makes me feel better knowing that if something happens they have professional staffing to take care of it. Also gives me Comfort to know that I can watch my dog on the video cam via my phone at work to check in on her and see how much fun she's having! Can't wait to start her puppy training!!!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Camp Bow Wow Temecula. During a recent overnight boarding, when my dog came home she was unable to walk properly due to her legs collapsing under her and poor coordination. She was taken to the local pet emergency department for evaluation which resulted in a 36 hour admission and neurologist follow up who diagnosed her with a Spinal Cord Contusion.

There is no definitive proof that my dog sustained the spinal cord contusion during her stay at Camp Bow Wow Temecula so this bad review is not based on that. I understand that accidents happen and that the dogs participate in group play during their stay. The reason for this bad review is because of the staffs behavior surrounding this incident.

When my dog was sent home, her report card said that there were no incidents during her stay and that she was a "happy camper." However, when I called to inquire if they could check her record for any incidents, the woman that I spoke to said that she did not need to check the record because she remembered my dog and that all she did was bark in her kennel while she was there. This is something that should have been on the report card. I also asked if there was a way to check if my dog was accidentally dropped, jumped on by another dog, given another dogs medication, or accidentally ingested something as all of those things could cause neurologic problems. The woman became defensive and denied these things. I then asked to speak to a manager, was told that one was not there at that time, and I said I would check back when there was one.

Later on I was contacted by the owner Lisa. At that time she was very apologetic and expressed compassion about my dogs condition. She then promised me that she or another staff member would check the video footage to help identify a potential cause for her condition and follow up with me. It is now 48 hours later and I have yet to hear back from anyone at Camp Bow Wow to check on her or report that they did/did not see anything on the video footage.

This bad review is because I do not feel that my pet was safe at Camp Bow Wow- not because of her potentially getting hurt while she is there, accidents happen- but because I do not trust the staff to act and follow through in the event of an emergency. During my telephone conversation with the manager, she reported to me that after speaking to one of the staff members, one of them did see my dog "walk funny" at one point but did not act on it because she didn't know if it was normal. They never called me asking if it was normal and if I wanted her to be seen by a veterinarian. Additionally, there was no report of this observation (or about her barking lots while in her kennel) on the report card. Needless to say, I will not be taking my dog back to Camp Bow Wow and I hope this review allows you to make an informed decision about where your dog stays while you're away.

UPDATE on 4/25/19 in response to reply:
My dog does not have a history of seizures and is not prescribed seizure medication. Also, my dog did not recently have a change in her food.

I am unsure of where this narrative about her "only getting the food she was provided" and that she "had couple of seizures" and to "watch for that" came from because Ava has no neurological medical history.

I spoke with the owner 8 days ago and have not received any follow up contact via phone from the facility about our original conversation which was promised. Their review reply was posted 6 days after my original review and contains information that ought to have been communicated to me either during my dogs boarding, when she went home, or during the phone conversation with the owner afterwards. Honestly, I didn't think I could become more disappointed in their approach to handling the situation but I am .

@Camp Bow Wow Temecula: Honestly, all I wanted was solid communication to discuss what happened. Not to point fingers but to ensure that Ava gets the help that she needs. You have dropped the ball on this one.< /Review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1556040783152, 'text': 'Dear Katie,  Thank you for taking the time to review Camp Bow Wow Temecula.  Negative reviews are tough; we try our hardest every single day to take great care of our campers.    When Ava checked into camp, our manager was informed that her diet had changed recently, and that we should be sure she only gets the food she was provided.  We were also informed that Ava may have had a couple of seizures recently and we should watch for that as well.  No medication for seizure prevention was given and Melissa communicated with the staff to keep an "extra eye" on her for symptoms.  No concerns in her behavior or demeanor were detected until she was walking out the door with the person who picked her up and our assistant manager chatted with your authorized pick-up person that she noticed a little trouble in the lobby with her back legs,.  We should have documented in your file right at check-in that you had shared health concerns about Ava.  Melissa and I are working on some additional communication processes,  We are also addressing the manner in which you were spoken to, to the person that took your call.  Thank you for bringing our communication shortcomings to our attention so that we can take our services to a "next level",  I, along with the rest of the Camp Bow Wow Temecula Team, are hopeful that Ava is feeling better, and we are working hard to make these lessons learned a part of our daily service offerings.  Best,  Lisa & Michael Haight Owner/Operators 951-587-2267'}</Response>

The staff is amazing and know exactly how to handle dogs. They are very attentive and alert to the pack they are watching. Every time we logged in there was someone with the group in the play yards. We were gone a week and our Chica acted like nothing in her life had changed, it was like we weren't even gone. It was exceptional for Woody who greatly responded from the experience and came back more socialized and confident. We are more than pleased and think of Camp Bow Wow as a great place for our babies to be when they can't be with us. They are great caring people and seem to love dogs just like they were their own.

We regularly used Camp Bow Wow back in the Chicago area. We were always VERY pleased with the service and care we and our fur babies received, so when we found one here, we were ecstatic! We always board our dogs together in the same kennel so they don't get lonely, but honestly they are so busy having fun I don't know that it's necessary. I love that we can check in on our babies via their webcam - being able to see them play/interact with other dogs brings a great deal of relief (and joy, too). The staff has always been amazing and this location is no exception! This is a fantastic solution for those of us who are in need of dog sitters. The prices are extremely reasonable, the staff is the best and our doggos have SO much fun there!! I highly recommend them! 👍👍</Review>

The Staff is AMAZING and truly care for your Dog.  They treat Brutus like he is their own.  The set up is great and the prizes are outstanding... and military friendly as well.  Everything from a tour, to the application to his interview was made VERY easy.  Brutus loves them.</review>

<Review>We were three days into a family vacation when we received a voicemail message from Melissa at Camp Bow Wow indicating concern for our dog “Mini Cooper” who had become lethargic and began to vomit blood.  As Melissa was unable to initially reach us, the decision was made by the team at Camp Bow Wow to take “Coop” to a local Veterinary hospital where he received the necessary emergency care that ultimately saved his life.

As “Coop” required continued treatment and the local Veterinary hospital was closing for the day, Camp Bow Wow’s owner Lisa personally transported our dog to a 24 hour emergency hospital in Murrieta.  She remained with “Coop” at the initial veterinary office, completed the transport and again waited at the hospital in Murrieta until she knew he was in good hands.

I recieved several calls both from Melissa at Camp Bow Wow and from Lisa with “Coop”.  Both kept me well informed of his status until we were able to catch the next flight home.

Additionally, they took outstanding care of “Mini Cooper’s” sister, who remained at Camp Bow Wow and was alone without her big brother for the first time in her life.

Had the team at Camp Bow Wow not made the decision to seek immediate treatment for our dog, he would have sucome to his ultimate diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

Our heartfelt thanks to the team at Camp Bow Wow Temecula and strong recommendation should anyone be seeking caring and dependable boarding services.<//Review><time>1552246909263< /time>< rating>

It was the perfect solution for us. Our two dogs are not social with other dogs. So instead of being crated for five days, they could stay home, while someone came in to take care of them. They were not stressed at all. Thank you! Lois A.< /text>

We left our 5 month old puppy for four days. When we would watch the live cam we could see them yanking our dog by the collar. Spraying him in the face with water and holding him on a lease. Our dog is not aggressive and is good with all dogs and kids. I had to call them from 400 miles away and ask them to please just kennel my puppy rather than be rough with him. Never gave him his treats or toy. He has also acted medicated for the past two days. I dropped off a happy puppy and picked up a scared puppy. He acts as though he was hit. I had a terrible experience.<//text>

I love that we can watch our dog on our cell phones when we are miles away from him! And I also like that your hours on Sundays are the same as the rest of the week. Your facility has the best availability of those in Temecula and the prices are comparable. Our dog came home happy and safe!</text>

<review>I really like that my dog gets to be out of her kennel during the day and has time to socialize and play with other dogs. I also like that she's provided a cot that is up off the floor in a kennel area that is more than ample for her to get up and walk around. It's also nice that she's able to get fresh air and sunshine and have fun during the day. I also appreciate your kind, caring staff who takes such good care of my sweet girl while she's there. Yvonne helped me when I called in for an early pick up, and she was so kind to me as well as my fur baby Kelsey. We choose to board Kelsey at the Temecula Camp Bow Wow as well as the Camp Bow Wow in Edmond, OK, when we lived there. We are preparing to move soon, and Yvonne let me know that when we move, if we use another Camp Bow Wow location, they can call the Temecula Camp and have her info transferred so that she doesn't have to do another "interview."< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Camp Bow Wow is a surprise for dog owners.  We appreciate how particular they are with proper shots, behavior, and 24 hour care. Plus it's fun, fun, and more fun.  Traditional day care and boarding facilities do not offer the same personal and caring atmosphere as CBW. CBW treats your pet the way they would want anyone to treat their own pet. Our dog Rusty can't wait to get out of the car and get inside to the staff and especially her playmates.  We feel very comfortable leaving our dog there and know she will be protected and happy.< /Review>< Pics>

They rejected my dog over the phone (queensland heeler) because I said I'm driving in from Nevada (3.5 hour drive)  You can tell the female on the phone was unstable just by her decision making with a few questions I asked.  Sketchy place and unreliable</Text>

We have taken our 2 Bassett hounds to Camp Bow Wow for a few years now and have had no major problems. You can even pay a very small (like $5) and you can watch your dog on an internet app so you can make sure they are ok. We have left our dogs there for 28 days and the staff had pretty much adopted them. They do definitely come home exhausted though there is nothing but play time during the day and at night they slept together in their own cabin.< /text>

< review>
We used Home Buddies (in-home care) thru Camp Bow Wow. We were very pleased and have/will recommend their service. Our in-home care specialists (Dakota and Howard) were excellent, They texted us with updates throughout our three day absence. Unfortunately, Morgan (our dog) was so stressed by the third day of our absence he had many accidents. Dakota was diligent in cleaning up the major mess and was very concerned for his wellbeing. Well, the good news is Morgan is back to normal. We will be using Camp Bow Wow (24 hour care) if we leave town in the future.<//review>

<Text>Love, love, love, CBW Temecula!  My dog Nikko is a pro and has no issues about being around other dogs.  Tucker on the other hand, hasn't had much socialization which made me very nervous.  It was a bit overwhelming for him at first, but the staff helped him through it.  He started playing and loved all the attention he received from the staff.  I used the web cam ALL the time and was thrilled to see them playing and having a ball.  It is a great feeling to see firsthand, they didn't feel like I abandoned them for a week, rather they were on a fun vacation themselves. I've been taking Nikko there for years and always VERY happy with the staff.  I'm so glad Tucker will fit right in next time he goes to camp!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

Camp Bow Wow is a nice place in Temecula to take your dog. If you are new, your dog gets a "review". The review takes three hours of your puppies time and only fifteen minutes of your time. You even get to watch your puppy interact with the other dogs. Even though the review takes three hours, your allowed to leave your dog for the day- basically giving you a free day of doggy care.

Leonidas, my puppy loved it there. It helped that he knew two other dogs, Samson and D. i had asked that my puppy be allowed to stay in the same room as Sam and D but due to his size, he was not. However, the package i recieved at the end of his doggy review day said that Leonidas had nap time with Sam and D.

When I am back in Temecula, Leonidas will be going to them!

Cons: alittle out of the way- Thank you GPS!

Pros: you get to monitor your puppy, you get a puppy package letting you know how he did and who he played!!

thanks for such a wonderfull time!</Text>

They forgot to feed my dog for 2 meals while she was staying 5 nights with them. They screwed up her reservation and displaced her for another dog even though she had been there for 4 days in a row at that point. Left me a terrifying message concerning my dog and then didn't answer the phone or return my calls until the next day. The girl at the front desk was very rude to me when I picked up my dog and discovered the mistreatment she had endured during her stay.<//Text>

It was our first time there and its absolutely a hidden gem! The vibes in there are cool but fun. Plus you can play your own music with their touchtunes. Random mix of people attend which is also nice.<//text>

<text>I adore every visit to this place.  It is a place I go when I need to come down from a hard day and am not in the most talkative moods.   The tenders tend to your needs but aren't pushy.

<text>This is a pretty neat little dive bar with some great decor. I would give them a 5-star rating if their drink prices weren't so high, and the gal who was bartending wasn't hitting on my date, LOL. We had a good laugh about it after we left, though. At any rate, I'll go back because the Jukebox is amazing, and it's a fun place to go just to relax and hang out with a pretty good group of people.< /text><rating>3</rating>< user>

<review>The costumer service is really bad. Or should I say, non existant.
My friend and I walked in. Sat at a table. The place was not empty because there was a total of 6 people. We waited for 15 mins. The bartender avoided eye contact with objective of providing service. She was doing literally nothing. We never felt so ignored by any business. If we had to order at the bar, should have said something. But no. Completely ignored our presence even though the place was dead. I hardly ever write a review but this experience had to be shared.< /review><GmapID>0x80945b6d68fb96d7:0xf8b4fde55fe6816f< /GmapID>< user>

We sat at the table next to the bar Right in the middle of the place. There is no way she didnt see us. But she just chose to ignore us. We waited for over 10 mins and nothing. We felt like a ghost in there. I live nearby and will make sure my neighbors know the kind of hospitality they have. The lowest.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Def in a better part of town, the music isn't too bad but the service was awful. The 1 bartender they had took almost 20 min to serve us and would even look at us and move to the next customer. A very polite woman next to us asked for a zest a lime and the bartender very impolitely told her she couldn't and didn't have a "zester". Then bartender processed to take the girl outside and try to fight her. Someone needs to teach this bartender about customer service. Who tries to fight a customer over lime zest? I'd come back if that bartender wasn't there again. Closed my tab right away.</Text>

HORRIBLE SERVICE! & BAD CLIENTELE!!  Used to be a GREAT spot to relax after along day, NOW if you're NOT being ignored by the bartender, the fellow patrons will start a FIGHT, because you said; excuse me miss, and her male friend thinks you're hitting on HER!!
Go to "SKYLINE" on Clovis ave. Safer, cleaner, SUPERIOR SERVICE & GOOD FOOD!<//Text>

<text>Their food is relatively cheap in price but the flavor and quality is great. The out door dining is awesome at night with the fire place going. The service is great too. I don't know why it shows two money signs, this restaurants prices are very affordable, my meal is cheaper on price than a combo meal at McDonald's. The to makes it more expensive. Alejandra is always great, she is helpful and goes out of her way to help me every time I come in.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpqVKg92esMzvCkvyflJEcU3Sg2xMhySnUoiu1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Last night I ordered to go, and I want to give a shout out to two hard working employees who were taking orders: Jessica and Jackie! While waiting for my order, I witnessed first hand how hard these two ladies work! When there was a lull in customers, they didn't take a breather and chat, instead, they each went and helped out in other areas, and were constantly on the move. Jessica and Jackie earned my 5 stars!</Review>

The cage free chicken club and hummingbird cake is what I get every time religiously.

The cage free chicken is always juicy and the bacon adds a nice saltiness to the entire sandwich. The hummingbird cake is layers of banana cake soaked with rum syrup and layered with pineapple, cream cheese frosting and chopped walnut garnish. The cake is the perfect way to end the meal.

If you’re thirsty the Passion Fruit, Coconut, and Lime Replenisher is refreshing and delicious.< /text>

Saw sign outside when walking by for their chicken tenders. My son is a connesuier, so I had to go in. Great looking menu, but got just the tenders.
Habanero sauce wasn't too hot, but had good flavor. The others were fine. All a matter of taste. The tenders are crispy or hot. I looked the hot better, with no sauce.
Got the large cookie and it was good, too. Looking forward to trying more of the menu.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Urban Plates is an excellent and exquisite, organic-based food restaurant. I visited their location in Manhattan Beach, and it was such a delight. The food was tasty, mouthwatering, and divine sans the guilt because everything is organic. The staff was charming. My husband, dear friend, and I had a beautiful experience. I highly recommend this restaurant—it’s a gem. Thank you.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b3b172ca923d:0x53b94712e0edf1ea</gmapID></record>

It is a very interesting place with a variety of plates in the menu, very friendly employees, and welcoming atmosphere for a reasonable price. The food is also delicious, and the service is very quick! Self-service mixed with traditional restaurant service is an interesting combination, which also makes this place stand out among other restaurants. An ability to mix different types of meats and sides is also an interesting novelty. This is definitely not our last visit to this place!</text>

<Review>Everything is organic and made from scratch.....for example they make their dressings from scratch not once but twice daily! Everything we tried was delicious and affordable for the value of  our dollar. The staff and management very friendly, helpful and accommodating. We will be back to try new things!< /Review>< Rate>

We really like this new Manhattan Beach location. The interior decoration is very nice and the exterior seating is cool with fire pits. The food, as always, is great! I had the super-delicious portobello mushroom sandwich. My daughter loved the braised beef and my wife really liked her tofu vegetable Curry braised. Did I mention the scrumptious Mango Tart Pie? A great dining experience!</Text>

THIS WAS THE WORST PLACE! We walked in one minute before they were suppose to close and the waitress looked at us and loudly said, “WE’RE CLOSED”.   She was serving someone at the time and was very unprofessional. I was disappointed at everything about this place.<//Text>

I called to ask if they could send 10 meals to nurses at Little Company of Mary to thank them for taking care of my husband. The general manager comped half the meals and took the meals to the hospital himself. He then called me to say they had arrived and the staff was "thrilled." What a mensch. The food is great and Urban Plates' spirit is even better!</text>

Also the prices are as good as you can get for the food quality. It's not cheap, but considering food is organic, healthy, and portions are well sized the value is excellent.< /text><Rating>5</Rating>< gmapID>

<review>I finally stopped by this place I've been wanting to try. I was greeted as I walked in asking if I needed any help with the menu. All food is organic and made in house. You walk up to the register, place your order and they deliver it to your table. Prices are reasonable and they offer vegetarian options as well.

I ordered the grass fed steak with one side. Food came out fairly quickly and the overall service was amazing. Brinton was awesome at helping me decide what to order.

The steak was flavorful and tender. I prefer med with a little pink in the center. Although the steak seemed well done, I still thought it was tasty. I wanted to try their in house drinks but I knew I wouldn't have room for a dessert if I did. I ordered cookies but was too full to continue.

I will definitely return and try the other items on the menu.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>Food here is fresh, healthy & tasty. Servers are very nice, but it's a busy place, so expect to wait. I had the Cesar's salad with grilled salmon and it was good. I also had the gluten free pineapple cake and although I liked the flavour (it wasn't too sweet), I didn't enjoy the texture of the cake; it was a little weird -- I can't really describe it.</Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>Upon arriving Britt greeted us and explained to us how ordering works and offered some recommendations on the food. He was very polite and came to our table a few times to make sure everything was okay. We had the braised beef  and turkey meat loaf. Both plates offered a generous portion and tasted great.</Text>< pics>

We popped in for a quick dinner. Sooo good. The food is fresh and delicious. You order your own food at the counter but then the servers bring the food out and take care of you. They have natural sodas that are so good. Look forward to going again<//text>

I tried their Ahi salad which was very good. I also tried their curry soup which wasn't as tasty as I expected.  They did offer to replace it with something else, however.
Service is friendly and the food is fresh. They have very tasty dessert pastries, so leave some room for dessert.< /Review>

Decent place to eat good whole food at a reasonable price. I will say this, the evening my significant other and I went there to eat, one of the waitresses made it quite obvious she was unapproving of the fact that we were an interracial couple. She refused to bring flatware with the food, never once checked in with us after dropping off plates(even though she Did check on every other table in her section repeatedly), and proceeded to roll her eyes and make faces at me when my significant other was away from the table, trying to track down the items she refused to bring us. This was not a pleasant aspect of our visit here.<//Review>< Pics>

My sister and I visited this restaurant by mistake and what a good one it was. The food was good I had the Sea Bass & it was so yummy, my sister had the Moroccan chicken but she felt it could use some more spices and she's right , but overall the food was good as was the service. And surprisingly the prices were good as well, one thing I didn't like was the juices , too tart for me and I'm a juicer which was puzzling because mine are never that tart. So next I go with beer.

Food took over 35 minutes to come out and was cold. Only had one person working the register on a Saturday night as well. I’ve been to the one in Playa and had a fine experience, but I for sure will not be coming back to the Manhattan beach location.< /review>

Not the best. I went inside to order togo. I ended up waiting more than 30 min while my food just sat there because they forgot about me and then said they thought it was a phone order. Everything was cold by the time I drove 5 mins home. Cold food is not so good... Not to mention my wife's salad was so drenched in dressing it was wilted and not eatable.< /Review>

The food here is urbanly delish. Their salads are my fave. My family and i have eaten here numerous times. The employees are nice and it is always a delight to be greeted by the host Michelle. Her smile and bubblyness keeps us coming back.< /Text>

<text>Looks so nice inside ,the cashier was very patient with me and answered all my questions. I ordered a chimichurri steak plate with mash and lentils, soooo bombbbb . Also got a couple kids plates and my mom ordered the Asian chicken salad , we literally got our food within like 10 minutes of ordering (we came around dinner time). Got our table checked on twice. Plus the parking was super easy to find :)< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Had grass fed beef that was texturally oddly gritty and just really bad, like they used beef that had been rejected by the prison system.< /Text>

<review>Got delivered it was cold. But a microwave fixed that.

The biggest issue was the wings. Supppppppper fatty. Like slime. They need to get with a research company to fix this.</review>< rating>

<Review>Horrible service I placed my order online and I waited 20min before heading to pick it up just for them to tell it wasn't ready until 15min later so waited the extra 15min then I went back in so they can tell me that it wasn't even in oven yet I would have to wait another 15 to 20 min. That's when I lost it got me so angry it was lunch for my daughter she didn't get to eat till she got off work because of their mistake. I was told that he was the only person working and he couldn't do anything about it bad management.< /Review>< Pictures>

This Papa John 's Pizza sadly don't have enough varieties of dressings nothing but garlic dressing. And I also didn't receive my receive with change. I only received my change so I didn't get the chance to know the employee's name. Bad consumer services. But the pizza was delicious!<//review>

I enjoy ordering from here! I random got given a gift for a free large pizza after ordering for a pick up here. I would definitely order from here again in the future. I like how quick they are because I live 3 blocks away from here. Deliveries can take an hour so beware!</review>

Place an order thru my phone and it was taking a while to get me my confirmation number so I called the place. Some lady answers I give her my name and says, "No it's not here" and hangs up! What kind of service is that? Poor customer service.<//Text>

If I could give zero stars I will do it just because is not that I’m against tips but be really careful the cashier will punch in for you to pay a tip... a tip for what? I asked the cashier because I saw when he pressed the tip option and he said he didn’t that I must of saw the amount backwards and when my receipt printed out I proved to him that he did added a tip.  That dollar is not going to make me richer or poorer but it’s an abused in my opinion, now I wonder how many times I come in a hurry and I haven’t notice how many times they had done this. Ridiculous never coming back here.<//text>

Worst customer service I can’t believe it.....and coming from papa johns!!!!!
had a promo code that was sent to me through the mail and doesn’t expire till 12-11-19 they don’t want to honor it or apologize for the inconvenience. If your promo codes aren’t going to validate when ordering over the phone or online save the money in marketing and just don’t send any :(< /Text>

< Review>
Food is okay, I've had a few overcooked orders. The most consistent issue I've had with this location is the inaccuracy of orders. I used to order pizza here every Friday for game night and over half of my orders ended up wrong. I've had issues such as wrong/missing dipping sauces, wrong toppings and the one that usually bothers me is when I ask for Chicago cut and they give me regular. I've emailed the company and spoke to to the manager but I still received inaccurate orders. I finally gave up and decided to take my business elsewhere.<//Review>

Came in to pick up a pizza I ordered online , the pizza was almost the same size as a personal one for $11 , I asked for my money back and when one of the young guys came to void the transaction he was making a pizza , as he left back to make the pizza I noticed he went straight to continue doing the pizza after touching the register , he didn't wash his hands ! goes to show how unsanitary  this pizza place is ! Don't recommend it !<//text>

This place is a hit or miss, sometimes they are on time and sometimes they take too long, sometimes the pizza is really good and sometimes its little ceasers quality.</review>

They are known for their dipping ramen. Their menu is concise and easy to pick from. The service is great and the food was prepared quickly. They have outdoor sittings available.

-1 star because they didn't follow any protocol of taking temperature or hand sanitization. When you pay with cards, you still have to sign on their touchscreen devices (making it unsanitary as they don't clean it after each use).  -1 because I don't think there's anything unique about this place. The flavor is average, the noodle is standard, and overall, sitting right on the benchmark.

Expect to pay between $18-25 per person. I'll be trying nearby restaurants first before considering returning.< /review>

A restaurant I should visit more often! I went to order the Tsukemen (dipping ramen) and I loved it. The noodles were nice and thick while the broth had a very delicious taste with a nice fragrance and an egg to add to the meal. I also had some peach juice to drink which I also liked. The workers were also extremely nice and kind to me which improved the experience even more.< /review>

<Review>Overview:
Did some research before coming here and decided to come to this location vs their annex location across the street.  Haven't had the annex location yet but very glad that we chose this one!  First off, can I just say that I appreciate a ramen shop that understands my late night ramen cravings and so they're open late?  We came here for second dinner at midnight and pretty much had the shop to ourselves.

Food:
I am a huge tsukemen fan so when I heard this place is known for their dipping ramen then I had to try it.  I immediately picked the cha siu tsukemen since it comes with the most food :P   The noodles were a great level of firmness, the chashu pork for tender, and the broth.... the broth was absolutely awesome and reminded me of some ramen shops I had in Japan.  I was really full afterwards!  To this day, I still day dream about it every now and then and plan to come back as soon as I can!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>easily the best tsukemen you will find in SoCal, and probably a top contender for best tsukemen west of the Rockies.

fwiw, i only ever order the tsukemen when i come here. I'm sure their ramen is great, but the tsukemen is just that good.

the broth is velvety and sumptuous, the char siu is evanescently tender, and the noodles have a delightfully springy bite to them. squeeze the lime they give you over the noodles to add some brightness and acidity to cut through the richness.

the portion might seem small but a regular bowl of noodles and broth is a challenge for me (a fully grown man with a healthy appetite). with extra char siu (that is, in addition to the pieces already in the broth) and a seasoned egg, it's a veritable feast.

if you live in Southern California and like Asian food, you owe it to yourself to come here. undefeated.< /Review><username>Nimish Pratha<//username>< user_id>

Went to this Noodle shop from recommendation from a you tube video.

This was our first time here and we wanted a nice hot bowel of noodles/ramen, because it was quite cool outside that evening.

We were so hungry and we both ordered Charlie tsukemen by mistake. The cold noodles were thick and delicious.  The slices of pork belly are amazing as well. The broth was a hot dipping broth in a separate bowl, also tasted good.

We both decided to dump the dipping sauce all over the noodles bowl to in order to avoid having to dip the noodles each time we took a bite to eat.

This combination was still good, but not what we wanted on the chilly evening.

Next time I am going to order the spicy ramen with level 3 heat.  That way I know we have ordered something served steaming hot.  The normal way we like or orders.

Going back soon!</Text>

<Text>Greetings,
Attached is the receipt of my purchase to emphasize truth to my claims of having dined-in at Tsujita LA Artisan Noodle. First off, I had horrible experience eating here and will not recommend you eat here. The noodles were cold. Initially, I dismissed this as the style of the noodles early on as I felt this place warranted my patience and understanding of the dish. However, I was wrong because then the broth was cold, which is an understatement to the reality that no heat at all radiated from this highly reviewed restaurant.

Most importantly, I failed to accept this reality of having a bad experience as I like to remain optimistic until the server, Saki, confused me and my partner's order, henceforth, destroying the last remaining shred of patience and our commitment to wanting to have a good time. We did not enjoy a peaceful and delicious meal. We were provided a completely different broth after asking for the same broth, which ruined our entire meal as the flavor was completely different from our initial order. At no point was it communicated and presented to us an option to pay more for the same broth prior to the servers mistake that ruined our meal. When presenting with the facts, the server did indeed state that it was a different broth. Our first was pork/fish based and the second provided was soley fish based to the point that you can actually smell fish. One confronted with the evidence the server realizing her mistake lied to us stating that what we initially ordered was exactly the same. It was not the same. A child could see the difference in color let alone the taste. We are not blind. In light of Saki's rhetoric and delivery of speech, we now felt profoundly offended. To top it off, she remained committed to ignore her mistake and force us to pay. We were not presented an opportunity of a new dish but, an additional cost as a reprimand to a mistake we did not make.

In sum, I have not felt such dissatisfaction from eating somewhere in my 25 years in Los Angeles that I felt appalled to continue the conversation with a server with no customer service skills. To her defense, closing time neared at the restaurant and I felt an urgency from the servers to want to leave. It being the end of the day I completely understand the feeling of dread of wanting to go home. However, this carelessness cost me and my partner our time, money, and energy that we can never reclaim. I am grateful for the privilege to having identified a future chain of restaurants I will never dine in ever again and recommend. It pains me to write this. The reality is that this review is well deserved and if possible no stars should be an option. Thank you for your time and would be more than delighted to look forward to a response.< /Text><rate>1<//rate>< GmapID>

1st timer here. I have to say the tsukemen was very salty. It has a funky kind of gamey taste. I also ordered the ramen which was a little better but it has a strong vinegar smell to it. Very underwhelming. Go to Mitsuwa or Marugame! Much better tasting ramen and broth.
Really disappointed and there’s so many positive reviews and hype! :*[ :( ;(<//text>

I’ve been lucky enough to try a lot of ramens all across the US. I still think Vegas and LA have some of the best outside Japan. I’d never tried Tsujita until today. I got one tonkotsu and one tsukemen ramen. Both were very dull compared to places like Mitsuwas ramen restaurants, and others around Hollywood. The tsukemen had a very game meat like taste, almost like it was slightly off. The tonkotsu ramen was basic but better than the odd gamey smell and taste of the tsukemen. This is supposedly the best ramen in LA, it’s not. The broths were also served lukewarm/cold to touch as a pamphlet is included for you to reheat yourself via microwave. Just not worth the buzz at all, in my opinion.

Edit: Got horrible food poisoning last night after eating Tsujita. Still feel bad today. It was all I ate yesterday so know it was that for sure. Saw it’s gotten a C health department grade in the past too, which was worrisome.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Excellent ambiance. Easy to find right on a well trafficked corner. Plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. Waitstaff was very friendly and accommodating of questions. Your entire party must be present in order to be seated due to covid rules so just be advised on that. Food was excellent and the drinks were standard fare for a nicer Japanese restaurant. Asahi and nigori sake were the orders in my group. The ramen was well prepared and the noodles had a good consistency and flavor to the broth. The pork was flavorful, tender and had a slightly smoky flavor which was VERY good. Extra noodles were quick to come out if you find you want more after you finish your initial bowl. Across the street is another Tsujita spot but we did not go over to investigate. Definitely would recommend a visit here. Side note, for parties over 4, splitting the bill can take a bit of time as it is pretty popular and waitstaff get busy.<//review>< pictures>

<review>The wait was short even though it seemed busy, the service was really nice and they had options for extra toppings and noodles, as well as a choice for a level of spice, which was neat. The chashu was really tender and the egg was made really well. There were unique ramen choices, I tried the summer cold noodles. There was a fly that kept hanging around our table and that kind of bothered us a bit.</review>< pics>

<text>One of the only great tsukemen spots in LA. The noodles are made perfectly chewy, and the rich broth is mouthwatering. There’s always a wait at the main store, so I suggest ordering takeout from their many other locations.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<time>1615702889029<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>New customer beware! Tsukemen is COLD noodles served with a side of lukewarm thick curry and cold pork belly. I expected the dish to be hot. No where on the menu was it clearly stated this is a cold dish.

The restaurant refused to make a new dish. Instead, they microwaved the noodles, and brought back a small amount of ramen broth to mix in with the Tsukemen broth to "bring it up to temperature". Very cheap and over charge for their copycat version of Chinese Dan Dan noodles.  This restaurant is over rated. They do not deserve royal customers. They have taken for granted the high reviews, and the reality is they fall short and the menu is MISLEADING!It's a cheap restaurant! Becareful to not get ripped-off!< /text>< Pics>

The 30 minute wait was well worth it. This was my first time trying the Tsujita style ramen and it was quite memorable. The texture and flavor of the noodles were perfect. It certainly did not contain the strong lye water taste like most ramen. After trying this, I still prefer ramen with broth but I'm certainly hoping they would consider creating a light broth with the same type of noodles for those who prefer something light that day.

I did however, had to take away a star because my gravy/sauce was lukewarm.< /review>

This is where you come to escape the hustle and bustle of LA. Although the wait is lengthy and you will be in and out in about 30 mins it's worth all the hype! The pleasure you can get from the famous tsukemen is beyond fantastic! Make the trip, wait the wait and dip those noodles to your hearts content!</Text>

<review>Adding lime on the noodles dramatically changed the taste.  The store suggested to try without lime first, and add it afterward.  It's really totally two different type tastes and both are very good.  It can be better if the temperature of soup can be warmer.  Long waiting line here after 11:30, but turnover is quick too.<//review>< pictures>

They may have descended from the untouchable, unearthly heights of the finest tsukumen in the country that they were when they first opened, but they're still a superb meal.

Ramen may be even more consistent and better these days, but when they're on their A-game, their tsukumen is among the very best available. When they're not, they're still damned good.<//Review>

The tsukemen broth was room temperature and the noodles were served cold. Broth could have been hotter and more flavorful in my opinion. I will say the chatsu pork was fantastic though so it's worth a try. My fiancé loved it a lot more than I did.<//review>

A small wait on a Wednesday evening. Service was friendly and attentive. Ramen was good - the noodles were excellent. The broth was on the saltier side of ramen but rich in flavor. The egg was ooey gooey inside but lacked flavor in the white.  The pork was tender but didn’t melt in my mouth. I did not try their signature TSUKEMEN but my friend enjoyed hers.<//review>

Visiting this place was the worst experience I have ever had, we received the worst service from the waitress Saki who made a very unpleasant mistake with our food and the only thing she made sure was to collect the bill in the most unpleasant and aggressive way.  It was a completely disgusting experience.  We will never return.</Review>

Tatsu ramen is really good here. The place is small and really crowded, we'd to wait around 20 minutes for sitting. The staff is great: friendly and quick. There is not parking here, but you can park around on the street. Don't do that on Sawtelle because you'll have just one hour.
Only cash. No cards.<//Review>

Another great meal at Tsujuta. The noodles were fresh, with good chew. The char siu was tender. The star of the show is that broth, though. It was so rich, with such depth of flavor... a credit to how long they spend preparing it. If you're in the area, you can't go wrong... unless you don't stop in to Tsujita.< /Text>

The egg is boiled to perfection; the yolk oozes and it’s unbelievably creamy. The noodle is a little thick and firm. I personally prefer their tsukemen to their ramen.

The restaurant is rather tiny, and it does get really busy. The line can be really long especially on the weekends.<//Review>< Pics>

First time having tsukemen and can't wait to try others. Was always a ramen person but I was blown away when I first tried it. Doing the noodles into a broth never appealed to me, but this was amazing the broth had so much flavor and the noodles were the perfect chewiness. Be sure to ask for more lime as the lime is what makes it that much more better IMO.< /Review>

I heard a lot about this place and the other Tsujita across the street but we went here because they say the broth is more sea food flavored. The tsukemen here was fantastic.  Adding the lime really does change the flavor and makes it so much better. Service was quick and limes are unlimited.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOPwoKnVKoyW5o1l0FW0PzJD4MsfZQROvJJWiU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I would come back for more. The broth is very delicious n full with fatty fat from pork. The portion is big for small person like me. I'd recommend to share a combo bowl for a party of 2! The fruit (grap& peach) drinks are alright.  Peach one is lighter n better. Go for green tea- authentic drink< /text>

Wow another amazing ramen place in LA! I ordered take out from Tsujita and loved the attention to detail. Everything was packaged to perfection with instructions for how to enjoy your ramen from home. They provided reheat directions and the proper bowls/utensils.

The vegan ramen + egg was amazing as well as the Spicy Tuna Bowl. My boyfriend ordered one of the Tsukemen-style ramens and loved it! You will not be disappointed coming here!< /Text>

Try their dipping ramen. Nothing else like it. Their broth is a little more thicker and saturated. Flavor is immense. Had to make this my first meal of the new year. Travel all the way from Orange County and willing to wait over an hour! Unbelievable food!<//Text>

<Review>We had to queue close to an hour for 2 seats on a regular Wednesday late evening. The portion was large. The soup was good and pork meat was soft.However, their noodles was the horrible! It tasted like i was being served some thin Udon that was way past its expiry date - stale and hard. The noodles totally ruined my appetite.<//Review>< pictures>

Tsukeman is on point. There's some acidity to balance out the richness of the broth. Noodles are fat and have good texture and chew. The sprouts and cabbage add some crunch. Pork belly is very soft. But that means the fat falls off and into the broth. Could use a green garnish like scallions to make the presentation pop. Generous portion size.

Maybe an LA ramen style thing but the Tsukeman everywhere else I've had it (Japan - Kyoto and tokyo, vancouver and Toronto) provide less dipping broth. So I was stuffed 😁</Text>

<review>Long wait for very good tsukemen. It was worth the wait for sure, but the broth was not my favorite style. Enjoyed everything thoroughly and was a bit disappointed that they didn’t have the dry chili paste that most tsukemen places have, but they had a nice replacement in the “spicy mustard”

While we waited there is actually a pretty cool store across the street so I would recommend that if you’re okay with a friend hanging back in the line.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9QhS8sb3RwOa5y_oGoao4PynaQ1rLht3cC9ti=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f<//gmap_id><Date>1534110739596<//Date><username>Chris Palmer</username></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
One of my favorite spots for tsukemen ! I love coming here and it's definitely worth the wait. It often looks bad but the tables go in and out pretty quickly.

I would recommend getting their tsukemen upon visiting - I usually get it with the char siu and the boiled egg. They give you a huge bowl of noodles with a small bowl of thick thick delicious broth to dip your noodles in ! Be careful, it's quite salty to just be sipping on by itself.

How I usually like to eat it is with extra extra likes and if you like spicy, they have a jar of pickles greens that goes really well with the noodles. SO SO good.

Once you're done with the meal, feel free to ask them to thin out your tsukemen soup with some broth to end the meal.

10/10 would recommend. Although some people have said it may be a little salty, I think it's definitely worth trying.<//Review>

<review>Excellent ramen!  The pork broth is super rich and flavorful.  Noodles are thicker than more traditional ramen, but very good.  Large bowl is way too much food.  Be sure to get the boiled egg, it is to die for.  If you show up after 6pm, you'll have to wait for at least 1.5 hours.</review>< gmap_id>

<Review>The gravy is super flavorful, I could drink it just like that ! Noodles are thick and fresh but I've had better... The service is also good.
The soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly.

I think there's better options in Little Tokyo, I don't know why but this place left me a little bit underwhelmed.

The best tsukemen and more broadly, noodle dish, I have ever had. It is mindblowingly good! I go there often with friends who also swear by this place. There’s usually a line, especially on Fridays and weekends. They used to only accept cash but recently switched to cards too.
Update** Their service is pretty terrible, especially since they opened up their new location in Glandale and transferred many of their stuff there. I was very dissatisfied on my recent visit. Food still rocks though!</Text>

<text>I was really looking forward to this authentic experience that was talked up by family and friends. My experience was rather mixed. We went with a party of 4 and although the line was a decent wait, COVID times meant not too many others were fighting for tables. The outdoor seating was decent for the size of the place and the QR code menu was an interesting way to stay sanitary.
We all ordered the standard go-to tsukemen which others recommended. I can see now why this ramen isn’t for everyone. Yes, the noodles are rather cold, and the broth that you dip in is supposed to counter that, but the broth needed to be hotter to do so. The noodles and the pork were great. Pork chashu is supposed to be that salty so no complaints there. Noodles were clearly authentic and had great texture.
The broth was something else. If you are sensitive to fishy smell/taste then you should stay away. The tsukemen is not advertised as being a fish based broth, but it was truly reeking of some sea-based product. Think fish gravy. Cutting the flavor with the added limes or even with requested chili on the side did little to mitigate that taste. One of our party’s members took one bite and was immediately put off eating any further.
I’d like to say that it ended there, but sadly several of our party members also suffered massive stomach pains the following night/day. Japanese food has never done that to me before, authentic or otherwise. We went out of our way to try this recommendation, unfortunately I won’t be passing the recommendation along. Be careful of hype.</text>< pics>

JAPAN 🇯🇵
Eat the World LA review:
Not to be outdone by downtown's Little Tokyo, the small area on Sawtelle Blvd with many Japanese businesses became known as Little Osaka. This apparently rubbed the wrong way on the folks that were not specifically from Osaka and eventually the strip was rebranded as Sawtelle Japantown, a decidedly boring name.
°
Anyone that loves Japanese food, and especially ramen, is supposed to come here for their famous tsukemen, tonkotsu broth that is simmered for a full 60 hours, sweetened and thickened by seafood. Tsukemen is served as components, you do the addition and subtraction yourself, usually dipping the noodles as you go. If you need more broth, it can be refilled. Ajitama tsukemen is broth with a seasoned soft boiled egg, it is also available plain or with char siu. After you finish your noodles, ask for them to pour in some light broth to the dipping sauce and enjoy the resulting soup on its own.
°
The standard bowl of tonkotsu ramen is also available here for those that prefer everything at one time.<//review>

< review>
After having some at an amazing little shop in Shinjuku, Tokyo, I was really craving some tsukemen (dipping noodles) once I was back in the states. I found this place had it, so I made the drive from Phoenix this weekend to give it another try. I was worried it would be an Americanized version, but I think they got it just right. The dipping broth is rich and thick like I remember and the noodles were great. I was a little confused at the end since I remembered the shop in Tokyo having insulated pitchers of soup stock (dashi) spread along the counter for pouring into your leftover dipping broth to make it thinner and more like a drinkable soup, but there was no pitchers on the tables they had here, and instead I was directed to this little "tsukemen" sauce bottle on the table... When I rephrased it, they took my bowl up to the counter where I finally saw the same sort of insulated pitcher I remembered from Japan. Once I had the bowl back with the warm soup it was just as tasty and made me feel happy to have made the trip from Phoenix. Thanks, all, for satisfying my craving! I hope tsukemen soon spreads across the US!</review>

I personally had a lot of Japanese ramen experience here and there but yet never tried this kind, dipping the noodles into the sauce! Loved the taste although a bit salty. There is a reaon for the long line even at night time- 10ish pm in LA with full of Asian food. I strongly recommend you to try the ramen with everything in and the salmon rice!<//Review>

My first time trying Tsukemen ramen and this was the place to do it!  The broth was amazing on its own but the noodles were the perfect consistency.  Great service too!  I'm sad I don't live in LA to eat here more often!< /Text>

<Review>Best noodles in Sawtelle, and definitely a must-go and go-to whenever humanly possible 🍜🙌🏼Perfect amount of spice in the "regular" spicy portion, meats are tender and fall apart upon contact, broth is on-point, with delicious depth, and the noodles are out of this world, done just right (al dente, little chewy to them). Everything is full of flavor and utterly delicious.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP30zTLIMMYGELzH354Knw8ces4kwQGuX_pWidQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Amazing ramen. Decent price when compared to places like ichiran in NYC. The soup is not too thick. Noodles were done perfectly. Loved it.< /Review>

This place is Cozy and arguably the best Ramen in LA. The Annex is small and easy to miss but it is definitely a hidden gem. There are only about 15-18 seats here  so there is usually a wait, but they take your order and start it so by the time you sit down, your order is almost finished. Be prepared for a little strange smell as you wait.

The Ramen is really high quality and thick. The broth is thick and rich and bursting with flavor. It's goes well with the thick noodles. To top it off, the pork just falls apart in your mouth and makes the experience. I got a soft boiled egg to go with it and it is a must have.

Despite being so busy, the customer service here is as great as could be expected! They always keep your glass full and occasionally check up on you. I highly recommend trying this place at least once. If you don't, you will miss out.< /Text>

Probably the best ramen shop in Los Angeles. I probably have tried the majority of the ramen shop in LA since before the whole ramen scene started years ago. This place remains as one of my top choices.</Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>So happy we were able to try this Ramen joint.  We've bookmarked it awhile ago.  We tried their famous dipping ramen.  I wished they served the dipping sauce hot rather than warm.  Save some noodles to warm the end to make it slurp up the sauce (ask them for noodle water to cancel out the saltiness of the broth).  The portion is big, but if you're a big noodle fan, order extra noodles for only $2.< /Text>< pics>

I really like this ramen place! The staff is friendly and the food is very good! Always order the dipping ramen, and occasionally get a salmon or spicy tuna bowl to share s well. Always try to stop by when in town.</review>

This used to be my go-to for ramen, but I tried it again a few years ago and it was just meh - I'd go to Daikokuya for ramen instead.

But my housemate re-introduced me to their tsukemen a few months ago, and boy was it good. Even to-go. Definitely crave-able. Got it again a month or two later.< /Review>

Compares to ramen you get on ramen street in JR station in Tokyo.  Most flavorable I have had on West Coast!  When in LA, will find a way to renew the memories of just how good this place is.< /Text>

Been coming here for years and it's always been delicious. The wait can get up to an hour but it's worth it. It's hard to accommodate parties larger than 4 but they'll still go with it.< /Text>

I think Tsujita would hold it's own in Tokyo, though I wouldn't wait more than 45 minutes. Came on a Friday night and it took maybe an hour, as the restaurant is small. The meal itself is super filling. I recommend getting tsukemen with chashu and ajitama. It was my family's first time trying tsukemen and they enjoyed the new experience.

Don't forget to get the soup wari! Basically, the dipping broth is too rich to drink (simmered for 60 hours!), so at the end of the meal, you dilate it with broth water such that it's drinkable!<//Review>

I enjoyed watching the chefs prepare the ramen from behind the counter. Interesting take on the toppings with a heaping of beansprouts and cabbage. Delicious ramen at an affordable price!< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Our experience with this company was horrific and disgusting and brought extreme suffering to my wife. I didn’t think it was easy to mess up ramen but Tsujita proved otherwise. The ramen was poisoned with a very bitter chemical that created a lot of bubbles, and it gave my wife severe food poisoning just an hour before our flight home. For almost 5 days of intense pain and vomiting, her face looked like what you see in the picture. Her lips grew massive to the point where they eventually started drooping down from the outside far worse than in this earlier photo. The chain refused to reimburse us damages for her pain and suffering. This is beyond outrageous - it flat out inhumane. Do not eat at this chain.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>We all know how amazing and delicious Tsujita is, so this review is to give them a shout out for how well they separate and package their food for take-out/delivery during this pandemic. Photo taken from my kitchen table, after simply transferring the food into dishes... Thank you, Tsujita.<//Review>< Pics>

Great service, good food! Similar broth to Tsujita Annex, possibly even the same, but thinner noodles. The aroma of the broth was definitely just as strong when walking inside. I'll definitely be coming back to try out some other menu options!<//Text>

Visiting LA and friends pointed to Tsujita LA as a must - go for noodles.. When we get there I realize that it serves tsukemen... whaaa..? It's noodles cooked that you dip in the broth. Huh? Why can't we be Slurp-happy and eat ramen?

But tsukemen is a better way to go. You savor the broth-seafood origins that both coats the noodles and becomes a vehicle to taste all the intricacies usually lost while slurping ramen. They want you to try the broth first, then try it with a squeeze of lime, then enjoy with various additions-mine was a a jar of  turnip-like stuff that added heat in a very earthy way. I want to know where I can buy this stuff!

When you're done with the noodles they come around and ask if you want to add broth to your soup. The original soup is very thick, almost undrinkable, but adding broth makes it a very pleasant ending to a great lunch.

The hostess is very nice, sensing we were newbies( it's that obvious?) but explaining how to eat tsukemen for the millionth time in a way that we weren't a bother.

If you go, go early, we walked in at 11amand when we left at11:45 it was like the first showing of Avengers "Endgame." Well worth the first visit, looking forward to the next!< /review>

YUMMY! I ordered a Tsukemen and my husband ordered a regular ramen. This is probably my favorite way to eat ramen! The service was great. It is cash only place. So make sure to have cash before you come. They do have an atm but when my husband went to pull some money out, the atm ran out of money. Cant say anymore because you should just go and try it out! Definitely worth going again!< /review>

This place was really good, but for being touted as one of the "best in the world", I had higher expectations.

Personally, I didn't care for the service style of separate noodles that needed to be dipped in the broth. The noodles tasted very average to me, but the broth was really good. However, the overall dining experience left me underwhelmed.

Prepare to wait for a long time, even at 10pm on a weeknight.</Text>

They serve both hot and cold sake. For an appetizer we had the pork gyoza. The dipping sauce was so flavorful. Completely different from the usual.< /text>

Highest quality tsukemen dipping ramen. The broth is savory and not too sour like some places. Don’t forget to squeeze lime on the noodles!

Also got the chasu ramen which was food but you don’t come here for that...

Long wait but the staff is friendly and efficient, taking your order while you wait so the food arrives faster. Parking is tight but you might have luck around the the neighboring streets.</text>

Tips:
- Ask if warm noodles possible
- Ask for hot soup if possible
- Ask for extra green onions
- Order everything plain, but ask for all toppings/condiments (spicy sauce, limes, etc.)
- ask for soup if you still have leftover tsukemen sauce</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f< /Gmap_id></record>

Yum yum yum!!! I’ve been here twice once with kids and once with friends and I had a great experience both times. The workers are filled with diversity and seem to feed off of each others positive vibes. They are always packed but it’s worth the wait, I also love that when you leave all the workers say goodbye and thank you it makes you feel like there aware of your presence even while working I will def be back!!🤗</Review>

Would love to give this place a higher review, but honestly, I don't think I could ever give anything more than 3 stars for a wait this long! Nothing is worth waiting hours and hours in line for!!

That being said, their tsukemen definitely is the way to go here. I've had tsukemen at so many other places in LA but nothing tops the unique consistency and taste that you get here.

I like the cheat and halfway through my bowl, I'll just dump the sauce/soup into the bowl of noodles because dipping is hard work! :P

Make sure you are mindful of your parking when you come here as the meters have limits and there are plenty of cops that will come by and enforce them!</Text>

Wait is well worth it. I was referred to this place by Japanese expats, who go out of the way to eat here for business trips. By far my favorite tsukemen.</Review>

< Review>
Was recommended by my Uber driver to come and give this place a try. My first time eating ramen like this. They were absolutely delicious, the noodles were chewy and the broth was so flavourful. I would recommend having the ramen “hard”, you want to have a bit of a chew. If you can, try getting here before 4pm. Anytime after that and you’ll be waiting for a while. The prices are pretty competitive with other places around here. Will definitely come back here if given the chance.<//Review>

I have been going here, almost weekly, for 6 years.  The Ajitama Tsukemen is my favorite thing to eat in all of LA, make sure to put a little spicy mustard leaf in your noodles.  Everyone is so nice here.  Since COVID, I have been getting the soup togo for the first time.  It takes them between 5-10 minutes to get it ready, you can order directly by just walking up.  They also sell Asahi beer to accompany your meal.  Still amazing food, but I am really missing seeing everyone there and listening that funky music, (pretty sure the music has changed once in 7 years, haha).  I'll be back, as always!  Keep kicking a** Tsujita and staff!< /review>

<Review>I can’t go back to regular ramen anymore.

I really wish dipping ramen/tsukumen was more popular outside of LA! The intense broth/“dip” flavours were perfect for me and my meathead bros. It was like a seafood gravy, and the thick, chewy noodles were so springy they reminded me of jajangmyeon. The “stages” of eating it wasn’t just a gimmick either, it was lightening the flavours so you wouldn’t feel like death after! ALSO: the soft boiled egg was perfectly boiled, the yolk was legit like liquid gold and just barely settled.

There’s generally a wait time and no real good area to lounge, but there are plenty of places to check around while you wait. Since it’s LA, expect to park on the street and pay for the meter (which is actually free on weekends!).

It’s a lovely different way to enjoy ramen, and probably my favourite way from now on.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been here multiple times, and every time was an amazing experience. The staff is incredibly friendly and the food is outstanding. The wait can be long, but that is expected from a place this good. Definitely worth coming here!< /review>

I don't like to give bad review but this restaurant is overrated. We arrived around 6:30pm and got a table right away but as soon as we came inside we smelled strong odor and it was bad. I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and my friend had Negi Ramen. Mine was acceptable but my friend's ramen was not good at all especially the broth taste so yucky. After a few hours, we both got stomach ache. It was a huge mistake coming here. I'm giving 2 stars because George gave a good service otherwise i would give one star only.< /review>

There was a little bit of a wait for a party of 3, but not more than 15 minutes (on a Sunday for lunch). Service was pretty quick after we placed our orders. There are only 2 options if you're vegetarian (spicy or non-spicy), so be warned. The broth was well made, and the thick noodles make for a delicious meal. The spicy ramen gives quite a kick, and that was only Level 1 spicy. Overall a fantastic and filling meal!< /Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>5 stars for the ramen.  Really amazing and loved it so much I came 3 days in a row while visiting LA.  I hope the owner/manager will read this - On Sep 7th I had dinner there.  I saw one of your employees eat their meal sitting on a pot right outside the narrow space in front of the bathrooms.  He was trying to eat his meal while avoiding being hit by the bathroom door as customers came in and out.  This condition looked like something out of a third world country.  It broke my heart that you’re not offering a decent, clean and humane space for your staff to eat their meal.  I felt so sad for your employee and left with a very negative impression of your restaurant.  I hope you can take better care of your employees.  They deserve a clean and comfortable place to eat.  Please do better.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Tastiest Ramen in LA. Super authentic. The noodles are amazing, and the broth is extremely flavorful. Wait times are very long though, it’s a small restaurant inside. If you have the time, it’s always worth the long wait. Great quality.< /Text>

<Text>Listen. It's worth it. Everything you've ever heard? True and then some. This place most absolutely smacks. The quality that goes into this food will open your eyes and make you realize how blasphemous instant  noodle is.

Now yes, this dipping noodle. I'm an avid ramen lover and didn't necessarily understand the concept behind dipping the noodle. Why not just put it all together and call it ramen?

Well, the broth is actually very flavorful. So flavorful that if you take a spoonful, it's too much to enjoy for long. Dipping the noodle and consuming (slurping is best) immediately after the dip, will be just want you need to enjoy it best. And yes, you should enjoy a couple of noodles and then add the lime. It somehow does an amazing job at subtly attaching itself to the noodle even after being dipped. Top it all off by asking for some extra hot water and you've just enjoyed some of the best noodle you'll ever have.

While here, I ordered the Cha Siu Tsukemen and shared it. It was so good I had to return to order for myself. The second time I still ordered the Cha Siu Tsukemen with extra noodles and extra egg. I regret nothing.

I can't wait to be reunited with this place again.<//Text>< Date>

By far our favorite ramen place right now. It's an amazing taste at a great value. The artisan Ramen taste really comes through as well as the unique qualities of their handcrafted ramen. Only a few items in the menu but when food is this good you really don’t need much.<//text>

No line at all for weekday noon. Thought Ramen would be best but ordered Tsukemen. Very flavored soup base. But to me still a little bit salty, which is all Tsukemen I had in U.S. Maybe they adjust the flavor for local taste. However, It would be good if you don't dip your noodle into soup too long.</review>

<rating>3<//rating><review>Been a few times, suffered long waits each time, never been satisfied with the taste. Definitely acquired taste, not your usual Ikkousha, etc for yum. Even Jinya at the Hollywood and Highland mall is far tastier - broth there and Ikkousha are delicious.
11/26/17- Went again with a Japanese from Hokkaido. Ditto for me on the acquired taste - lukewarm dipping noodles, boring broth to dip out in, not enough meat by far. Feel like I just spent $13+ to be fed leftovers. Tons of better tasting ramen shops besides this one. That said, friend immediately noticed the fish flavor in the broth, and being Japanese, liked the dipping noodles. Only downside for her was not enough lemon to squeeze over the noodles.<//review>< pics>

If you come before 6:15pm, there is hardly a line you will need to wait for. After that though, you may have to wait anywhere between 20-60 minutes, as the restaurant and its annex are quite small.The broth is most excellent, both ramen and tsukemen. The tsukemen broth is even more intense and fatty, but boy is it so delicious when you dip your noodles into it. Highly recommend this place.<//text>

I had never tried dipping noodles before and this was a pleasant experience. Although finding parking was a little difficult, but the food was well worth the walk. Helps you burn off all those noodles you eat.</review>

This place definitely attracts a trendy audience, and I wasn’t that impressed with it overall. I generally prefer places that are authentic, yet this place served a wide variety of noodles and soups from different Asian cultures. Their noodles are actually quite good, yet I found the broth to be lacking. Not one of my favorite places in Sawtelle, but definitely acceptable for a lunch.<//text>

My favorite noodle place by far. Come early either for lunch or dinner as it has limited sitting and there is always a wait. It's a dipping noodle with the best sauce and noodles I've ever tasted. I would suggest trying it once, maybe you won't love it like I do, but I promise you won't hate it.</review>

First Star: Is the location neat? Yes. The turnover is fast but a staff member is always on hand immediately to clear and wipe tables.

Second Star: Is the staff friendly? Yes.

Third Star: Is the service prompt? Yes. Once you've braved the line outside your food comes quickly. The staff is also conscious of taking orders from those in line to make the service move even quicker. Very efficient.

Fourth Star: Is the product/service satisfactory? Yes. Absolutely. The tsukemen broth is hearty and rich. The cold dipping noodles make a fantastic companion to the hot broth, keeping their springy chew until you're ready to dip. The char siu is tender and full of flavor.

Fifth star: Is the price acceptable? Yes. Always worth it to drop in.< /text>

<Review>We’re visiting from San Francisco and think this is the best ramen we’ve had in CA so far! We had the Tsukemen and Tonkatsu! The hard noodles were perfect and the broth was so flavorful.

See the red chili’s in the picture. Those chili’s are just one of the tiny nuances that makes this ramen one of the best. We arrived on a chilly saturday evening to have this ramen and I was pleasantly surprised to see about 30 odd people waiting to get in the restaurant. We opted for patio seating since the wait time was much less in the cold weather. Add 11.50 the ramen is priced reasonably but you do need to add 1.50 soft boiled eggs in order to make this ramen worth it. The broth itself is rich and the pork belly is soft and juicy. The best part about their ramen is that you can get extra broth for free. My girlfriend ended up having the vegan ramen which although tasted a little bit like pho but was worth it for her. Would definitely come back to try the tsukemen.< /review>

Tsujita never disappoints. Great place for lunch or for a late night dinner after you go to the Universal Studios because this place closes at 1.30 AM. I love the Chashu Ajitama Tsukemen here. The gravy is super flavorful. The noodles are thick and fresh. REALLY GOOD! If you don't finish the gravy, they give you some broth to mix with the gravy so you can drink the broth as soup.

There is almost always a wait at this place, so if you're not willing to put in the time, come early or later, but I guarantee that Tsujita doesn't disappoint.< /Review>

Wow. Usually when I hear of places like these, they end up being overrate, but I was definitely blown away.

Came here on a Saturday night at 8pm and the waitlist was still pretty long. We got lucky for a party  of 2 and was called in relatively quick.

We both had the tsukemen with chashu.
Hands down , one of the best, if not the best chashu I've had in a very long time .

The broth was very delicious for the noodles to be dipped in. The serving portion was pretty large as well. I came in starving and could not finish my food !

Service was very quick and attentive.

Definitely coming back</Text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>Great experience. Haven't eaten tsukemen for a while. The tsukemen comes with big chashu slices and seafood flavored soup. I like the idea of combing noodles with the lemon. Also, after finishing the noodles, they can add tonkotsu soup on top of your original soup. The only thing that I didn't like is that the soup gets cold easily of you sit   outside. Other than that, I enjoy everything.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuUf1DbgwPIFbg8CdlVIuOvhFchLFYnSZ3LW3g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

Before my visit, I'd never tried tsukemen and wasn't really a fan of Japanese ramen. However, the ajitama tsukemen here may have changed both of those statements. Well, at least in terms of dipping ramen. I thought the noodles were pleasantly chewy while the broth was thick and not overly salty. The soft-boiled egg and pork were as one would expect from a restaurant that specialized in ramen. My only complaint about the dish was that the broth was a little warmer than room temperature at best, and I'd prefer it to be much hotter. Overall, I left the restaurant feeling satisfied by both the taste and the portion, which is something I'd never experienced before upon finishing a meal at a ramen restaurant.<//text>

Pretty damn yummy. Spend the extra dollar and get the tsukemen with the soft boiled egg which was perfectly cooked by Ramen standards. It's expensive for what tsukemen is, but the delicious taste of the soup will have me comming back soon. The soup had these bits of really salty meat which I think went perfectly with the noodles, especially if used sparingly. The soup got cold quick due to the nature of tsukemen so I can't complain about that. It was a bit loud in there on a Thursday night, so i only recomend this place if you want to eat Ramen and nothing else. If you wanna talk to your date or whatever, get it out of your system while you're waiting outside becuase there can be a waiting list when busy. Seating is a bit cramped but I guess if they had less seats then the wait times would be longer. My only complaint is that there isn't more space for this wonderful restaurant to supply the demand for delicious Ramen. I wouldn't call this a traditional Ramen restaurant but I don't think it's what they're going for anyway. They provide a lime to twist over your noodles which is odd but I'm digging it. There's also hand fans at every table which is nice if you start sweating from the hot soup.</Text>

The standard go-to for anyone in Sawtelle, LA. Line wait can get long so be prepared, but the tsukemen (dipping ramen) they offer is tasty and comes with lemon midway to help zest it up. Friends have said that it's a bit too fishy for their taste, but YMMV<//text>

Dropped in on Mon I think. Service is typically above par. This place has a cool feel to it. I see why this place has a lot of good reviews.< /Text>

Don't go here during Covid, they will give you a third of the normal portion of broth. That's the whole reason they are special. Avoid until you can sit inside again<//Text>

Overhyped. Waited ages to get a table. Veggie ramen was average - the noodles were too thin in my opinion. Not worth the wait.< /review>

We had the veggie ramen with extra negi (green onion) and the negi tonkatsu (you can't have too much negi). It was all very good. Try the special spicy pickled takana. Asahi Dry was very cold as it should be.< /text>

The noodles are made fresh here and the best part: they're thick! Hands down the best noodles I have had in town thus far (if you like them thick that is.) But, like I was saying earlier, other joints will have broth flavors more fragrant than here.< /review>< Gmap_id>

The egg is by far the best I've ever had with ramen. The noodles were the perfect texture and thickness, the broth though wasn't as great as everyone says it is and also there was a big fruit for problem where we sat.  We we're constantly being attacked by them sitting right next to kitchen.  They need to fix this I felt like I was in a food stall in South East Asia not in LA</Text>

Very solid tsukumen joint, noodles are well cooked and broth is tasty. I wouldn't say it holds up to any of the better places in Japan, so calibrate expectations.</Text>

Very authentic Japanese cold noodle. I've been there several times. However, the last time I went there, the served dipping soup was only warm ,not hot, which made you feel the soup was greasy! It was a little bit disappointing, but from my overall experience, it was still a good one!< /review>

THE FOOD HERE IS SOOOO GOOD! I'd go out on a limb and assume that their noodles are made from scratch and it's very delicious, I'd highly recommend the tsukemen. The menu selection is small, but I think it's a matter of quality not quantity. It's also expensive and they only take cash, but in my opinion it's worth every penny. As far as I can tell the food seems to be pretty authentic.< /text>

The Tsukmen with Pork is incredibly filling and more salty then I like...although not so salty that I couldn't eat it. I wasn't the only person asking for a to-go container, as it was so filling and too good to leave behind. Staff is super, friendly and willing to explain the menu (there are actual instruction cards at each seat, advising how to eat this traditional food). Lines are long virtually all the time, so be prepared to wait, particularly on the weekends. For the food I'd give 4 starts, but...the entire facility could use a good scrubbing, the tables are sticky and restrooms poorly maintained, hence the 3 stars.<//Review>

I haven't found a ramen place that compares, they have a much different broth than most ramen I've tried, it's much fattier which makes it taste much richer. They have another restaurant with the same name across the street but it has a different style broth. You usually have to wait a decent amount to get seated because the place is small, but it's totally worth it. The pork is actually really flavorful and juicy too, definitely my top ramen place!< /Review>< Pics>

The tsukemen dipping soup is too thick and heavy for me, but nonetheless delicious. If you like spicy food, don't forget to try the spicy veggie paste on the table.

Hope one day this place can become card friendly. It's quite inconvenient to bring cash.< /review>

<Date>1534761635197<//Date><rating>5</rating><Review>One of the best ramen in Los Angeles. Their SOUPS are richer than most places. The WAIT could be over an hour on Friday nights and during peak hours. I have been there for quite a few times, and I notice a slight inconsistency in temperature of the soup base for Tsukemen. However, I still recommend this place. The serving size is not big and the noodles are priced at over $10 each, but the taste and quality of food make up the cost.< /Review>< pics>

Its good but slightly overrated in my opinion. It's somewhat overpriced I think for what you get. I just had a bowl of noodles and then some extra noodles. With tip it was 29$. I think it's worth more like 22$ with tip.<//Text>

The Tsukemen style is very interesting and their ramen/soup is so delicious that I forgot to take a picture before eating, then went straight to an additional bowl of ramen noodle and bottomed up all the soup after devouring the noodles. Happy and full, I can't wait to come back again.

That one has ramen in addition to tsukemen but both are different in their own ways. It’s about $16 for the meal which isn’t too bad considering how filling it is. Overall, exceptional food here though it can get very busy. Come on weekdays.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Tsujita is one of my favorite places in LA to get ramen and tsukumen. Their broth (which is the pillar of all good ramen) is rich and flavorful. You can taste the dedication that's been made to making the broth. If you're getting ramen, you can select thin, regular or thick noodle depending on what you like. It's slightly pricey, but you definitely get the quality you pay for.<//review>

Don’t quite get the long lines or the supposed hype.  The noodles and the barbecued pork are decent, but the dipping sauce is just way too salty even when diluted with more broth.  Egg a little too runny for me.  The cash-only part only served to inconvenience particularly at a restaurant at this price point.<//Review>

The ramen here is delicious. It seems to be a small location just like in Japan, if you have ever been to ramen place in Japan you will know what I am talking about. It is pork based so if you can’t eat pork for certain reasons it is better you go to another ramen place. I got the ramen that you can dip your noodles in. The broth itself has a lot of cabbage and mung bean sprouts so the medium might be enough to fill up. I think from the dipping noodles the only difference between a medium and large is that you are given more noodles.<//Text>

Some tips:
1. it's totally fine to slurp, it's actually encouraged
2. if you're looking for spicy, add a spoonful of pickled mustard (karashi takana) onto the noodles. it's very spicy so add only a little at a time
3. You can add the lime at anytime, I like adding it with about a third of the noodles left. This way you can experience the different flavors throughout the meal.
4. Once you're done with your noodles, they'll ask if you want 'wari' (beef broth). This way you can slurp hot broth to complete the meal

It was good. I don't agree with the menu recommendation. Select the all in one broth and noodles with no disappointments.</text>

<text>If you come to Japan town, I guarantee you that you will always see a line waiting to get in to Tsujita. People come here for one thing - tsukemon. The pork broth is flavorful without feeling greasy. Noodles are cooked to perfection and pork slices are tender. Your must try this place at least once! BTW, it's a cash only restaurant.</text>< username>

Everyone seems to like it much more than me. I personally don't like having my noodles separate from the broth. It was delicious, but not my preferred method of having ramen. The broth and noodles respectively were tasty. Watch out for the brown vegetable sauce that's on the table, it can be very spicy. Parking is difficult as it's located next to other very popular eateries.< /review>

There are 2 Tsujita Ramen across each other, the one right at the intersection accept CASH ONLY and the soup not good as the other location across the street. Tsujita Annex is accepting credit card and the broth to me taste better, spicier. Both locations are busy during peak lunch/dinner hours, you could wait in line for 30 mins and longer for a table of 2. The space/table is small, you are literally next to each other and in other face! There are table/booth for larger group otherwise you have to share sitting. Pricey but typical in West LA, expect $15-$20 for each bowl of ramen after tax.< /Review>

<Text>Wait times were abysmal, it took 20 minutes for my order to come out and another 10 to microwave it after I sent it back because of cold sauce. Music is grating and too loud. Wait staff are nice, but orders for the same table come out 15 minutes apart and often come out in sub standard quality. There is literally no excuse for having cold soup in a restaurant, yet somehow it happened here and somehow microwaving it took long enough for me to walk down the street and buy a coffee and come back and still wait another 5 minutes.

I took half my order home because I refuse to dignify such a place by finishing my meal there.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

First ramen experience and was not disappointed. Enjoyed the outdoor waiting area even though it is unusual. The ramen was delicious, the broth has a nice richness, the pork was cooked perfectly. Only complaint is from my wife as the fish sauce smell can be strong. I didn’t notice it after 5 min.< /text>

Make sure to slurp, that’s how you release all the flavor, the way everyone does it in Japan. This is the best tonkotsu I’ve ever had. Blows away everywhere else in LA.< /text>

<text>Really good broth and nice firm noodles; said noodles were oddly thick and almost udon-like, though. One other odd thing... The bowls are overfilled to the extent adding garlic or the (excellent, by the way) spice mix is impossible until you've made a very serious dent in your meal, as it's just not possible to mix anything in.</text><response>None< /response>< Time>

I've driven 50 min just to come here. On three different occasions. This place is seriously good. Broth is thick, crazy flavorful while noodles are thick and have that "bounce back" consistency (Big Sean needs to eat here). Pork is also juicy and tender. Don't come here if you're not going to get your grub on.

Side note: I only get tsukenmen (dipping ramen, not traditional).<//Text>

Still the gold standard for ramen shops on Sawtelle, Tsujita perfects the balance of soft tsukemen dipping noodles with the savory pork broth that makes you addicted at first taste. A must-stop destination any time you are in Los Angeles. I have never brought a guest that was disappointed with this delicious noodle house.< /text>

Let me save you the trouble of figuring out what to order - just get the tsukemen ramen. 75% of the time I visit I decide I want to try something different and order the tonkotsu ramen. And every time I wish I'd order the tsukemen instead. It's not that the tonkotsu ramen is bad, but their tsukemen is so much better. A thicker, more al dente noodle with a much more unique broth vs. the tonkotsu.<//Text>

Long wait but worth it. Only down side is that it is cash only. Other than that, i get their tsukamen and it is so good. Very tight spaced restaurant but the staff is so nice. I've been here atleast 5 times and it has not disappointed me at all.</review>

We've visited a few times for dinner, and Tsujita continues to impress. Japanese classics and specialties, all done very well. Their homemade tofu is great, and I had a very satisfying onigiri. My family enjoyed the chicken rice, pork, and tempura especially. Would recommend grabbing a reservation for dinner.</text>

Fantastic! Food was authentic and drop dead gorgeous. What amazed me mpst was the speed...we were in and out in 22 minutes, well fed, and happy. This place gets the new trend of good food at a great price that will not make loose out on an entire afternoon. Kudos.</text>

<text>I have been so reluctant to eat ramen since being back in the States after living in Japan for two years. But hands down this was pretty bomb. I had a regular pork ramen with all the green onions. Very flavorful broth, thin noodles which is my personal favorite, and the pork was cooked pretty similar. The one thing lacking close to JP was raw garlic that you can crush on your own. Oh and it was a plus that they had one Japanese female. But I wish we were greeted with "irashaimase!".< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

<text>I never knew I loved ramen so much. Honestly, I have never had ramen as good as this anywhere. Better than Momofuku in my non-expertise opinion. We make a couple hour drive just for this place periodically. Might be a bit of a wait but the line moves fast and if you're somehow hungry enough you can always get a refill on your soup and noodles for a great price!< /text><gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f</gmap_id>< user>

Fantastic tsukemen style ramen. There are some who really enjoy the rich unctuous broth (me!) and there may be some who find it too thick for their liking (bad coworker). Go try it to see if it is to your liking. Be prepared to wait, the line is always there for lunch and dinner<//review>

<Review>The best Tsukemen, for reals. After being introduced to it here, I seek it out at other ramen shops and haven't found any better than Tsujita's.
There's usually a line, btw.
Fast, friendly service.

In my opinion, this is the best place to get ramen in the area--which is really saying something, considering all the options within 20 yards! Simple menu, small interior, and no-fuss service and seating. it's cash only, as well, though there is an ATM in the back, make sure you bring cash if you don't want to pay the fees.

You'll want to be prepared to wait, whether you're there before it opens for lunch/dinner or just walking up. There's always a crowd of people standing outside, and there's a list that has the parties in front of you that you can add your name to. If it's not raining, I would say it doesn't matter at all if you're seated inside or outside. The last couple of times I've been there, the wait has been around half an hour. Your whole party has to be present to be seated.

If you like spicy, the level 3 spicy Tonkatsu is the best! It's a lingering heat, not burning, so you can happily eat through the entire bowl, navigating through an abundant amount of red peppers and green onions. The meat is super tender and flavorful, and the noodles (best purchased "hard" out of all the options!) are firm and taste fresh. I always have trouble picking between that and the Ajitama Tsukemen, which is the dipping ramen--definitely an experience on its own. It comes with thicker noodles and broth than the ramen that comes with the noodles in the broth, and the texture is unbelievable. Extra limes for the noodles are a must, and so is getting the lighter broth at the end to enjoy the entire experience.

Overall such a great spot in a great location. For sure worth the wait, and even though it's super busy you never feel like you're being rushed; great experience with great food every time.</Review>

It's not as good as the regular Tsujita restaurant. The broth was too fatty and they used too many additives in it. Should've just kept it simple. There were also a lot of flies in the restaurant which made it annoying having to keep swatting flies away while I ate. I did like the generous portion of bean sprouts though.<//Review>

CASH ONLY!

I like the noodles here better then the actual Tsujita restaurant across the street. I usually get the tsukemen ( dipping the noodles into a hot broth). There is usually a wait to be seated - it's a very small place. They will only take your order when your whole party is there. Upon ordering, when they call you to sit they've already begun cooking your food so you'll get it, usually, within 5 minutes of being seated. Amazing fatty broth - don't expect to do too much after you eat here.</review>

I had been excited about going to dinner here. As soon as I walked in I was hit with the extreme smell of urine. It was pure acidity. We sat down and couldn't even stay for a minute. We got up and left. I was very disappointed with this. The smell was powerful and left my stomach turning. So sad.</text>

We arrived before it opened, so the first wave of Tsukemen took half an hour of waiting. Other than that, everything is good. Tastes as good as Tsukemen you get in Japan.</Text>

Never ever forget the free garlic they have. And if you're a thick noodle fan, you're in heaven. Intense flavors tho, so beware!!< /review>

I mainly go for the tonkotsu Ramen. The broth is very rich and creamy, and the chashu is very tender. I like the noodles, but they're not my favorite.<//Review>

Authentic ramen joint. I can have this for breakfast,  lunch & dinner.
The place has very limited number of seats. So expect to wait for a seat. Well worth the wait though.<//text>

<Review>This is one of the best places to eat in Los Angeles. The tsukemen ramen is amazing. Bring cash and get ready to wait, unless you show up at a weird time. Parking and the wait are the worst parts. Find street parking or use the $5.00 parking garage, about a block away.</Review></record>

First, it's a really small restaurant and it reminds me of a small sushi restaurant like the ones in Little Tokyo. Second, I don't get why they only accept cash (but they have an ATM machie inside) when the one in Glendale accepts cards. Third, the place is pretty dirty. We were seated near the kitchen and the restroom and I felt really uncomfortable. It was packed and I was hungry so I just wanted to eat and get out of there. They had more serving of noodles here though. I wouldn't consider coming back to this specific branch<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The best tsukemen ever.  I find myself coming back at least once a month.  The broth is a bit thinner than annex, but whether or not you like that is a matter of preference.  I personally actually prefer the annex across the street<//review>

<Review>Awesome tasting Tokyo style tsukemen. All in all, a great bowl of ramen. Wait times can vary and the restaurant is cash only so prepare ahead of time. Party must all be there to be seated. Parking can be iffy in the area and many spots are metered.</Review>< pics>

I had been dying to try the place after hearing everyone raving about it.
While the tsukeman broth is full of flavor, I just can't get past the greasiness. *shudder*  Hubby's ramen was also undercooked!  I mean, really?!  That is an amateur mistake.  Oh yeah, and the amount of bean sprouts is just too too much.  Sorry.  Tsujita across the street is way better.< /text>

<text>The food is absolutely delicious, and pretty much everything on the menu is good (I prefer the char sui tskamen). You can even get a refill on noodles/broth for like $2 so you can take more home. The wait can be a bit long, but it is well worth it. I don't know how I'm going to cope without Tsujita if I were to ever leave.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Great ramen! For the tonkatsu, you have to get an egg separately so the cost adds up, but good quality. Would come back. Only 30 min wait too. Not sure how I'd feel if it were 1 hour+ wait as it can be during dinner times.</Review>< name>

<Review>Amazing ramen place. I always say good ramen requires 2 things. (1) Noodles with a good, chewy texture that is not too hard or too soft, and (2) a tasty broth that is rich in flavor but not overly salt. This place has both of these qualities. Try it out!</Review>< Pictures>

If you want high quality pork ramen, this is the place for you!

This restaurant was my first encounter with high quality ramen and continues to be the gold standard in which I compare others to. It's absolutely delicious and worth the, sometimes very long, wait. Unfortunately, they have very few seats and would not be a good idea for large parties.< /text>

Its decent ramen but oh my god the SMELL of it is disgusting. I wanted to vomit, I had to force a spoonful down my throat, at least the taste was better but it was rather bland. Meat was good though but it was HARD getting over the smell. I have never been to a ramen place were the dish smelled like dank sewage.</review>

My husband and I had never had dipping ramen noodles before, but this experience has changed ramen for us forever. The balance between the cold noodles and the hot dipping broth made the perfect ready to eat temperature. The flavors of the broth and the lime on the noodles complimented each other perfectly. I don't think regular ramen will ever satisfy us again. The staff were all very friendly in helping us and talking with us about the experience.</text>

This is a great place if you want to wait an hour to eat, then be told it will be ten more minutes. They didn't even bring us our food at the same time. My bowl came out 20 minutes after we were seated first, then 20 minutes later two more Bowls came out. This was a terrible dining experience.</text>

Tsujita is my favorite tsukemen place in LA, if not most of the world outside of Japan. The noodles are thicc and perfect in the summer with the tsukemen broth. I usually get the tsukemen with char siu and egg; packed with deep flavors and deliciousness. Sometimes I'll get the negi ramen (especially in winter), if you like your noodles ramen-style (thinner) and bathing with tons of green onions.< /review>

<Review>The tsukemen is very similar to the ones you will find in Japan. I would describe it as a diluted version of it. Tsukemen dipping sauce is traditionally more pungent and flavorful. The noodles are cooked perfectly but I don't recommend following their instructions about coating your noodles in lime. The lime easily overpowers the dipping sauce. It typically would not but since it is diluted it is easily overpowered. I give it a five star because it is the most closely authentic tsukemen I've found in the US.<//Review>< gmapID>

DELICIOUS!! The wait was 20 minutes which is really difficult for me to do because I get hangry. My friend was a little worried that I would rip her to pieces so we bought a snack nearby to hold me over. It was worth the wait. They take your order while you're waiting in line so that by the time you sit down, your meal is ready for you. GENIUS. I had the tsukemen with pork and added a soft boiled egg. I also added a ton of garlic--not that the broth needed it, but because I love garlic. These noodles were a perfect amount of chewiness and thickness. The pork was unbelievably tender, and so great with the slivers of green onions. I wish I lived in LA so I could come here all the time. The wait staff is super nice as well. Loved everything!< /Text>

<Review>The food was not good.  It's hard to screw up noodle soup but that happened. My soup was cold and the noodles were gummy. The server was rude and our original server went home during our order and didn't mention he was leaving.

The people seated next to us who were seated at the same time got their food a full 20 mins before us. This place is also cash only. Most people usually don't find out until it is time to pay the bill when you have to run to an out of network atm and eat the $3.00 to them and $2.00 to your bank.   I would never return to this place.<//Review>< rating>

Chashu Tsukemen!  their broth is extremely thick and flavorful.  I went in famished w/ eyes bigger than my stomach.  I ordered the large, but it was too much b/c the soup is so rich.  i would suggest one just orders the regular.  Also, make sure you request hot broth at the end of the meal so you can water down your soup and drink it.<//text>

I like this place and came here multiple times to have a bowl of ramen. I wish they would cut the egg in half and then place it on top of the ramen but that's okay!

This place was good. Had the tsukemen with their tonkotsu soup that they simmer for 60 hours. Even though it wasn't busy, it felt a little like their aim was to get people in and out quickly.< /text>

< Review>
The best tonkatsu ramen I've ever had. The broth is simmered for 60 hours, and you can taste it, it has a rich flavor and smooth mouthfeel. It's a busy place so expect a wait, maybe 15 minutes. However the service is quick and the food comes out within a few minutes of ordering. I recommend the boiled egg add-on and the hot mustard condiment for extra flavor. Cash only.<//Review>

This place used to be the best. Now everytime I go for like the past 4 months the soup is super cold. Halfway through your meal all the fat in the soup starts to harden. You guys really need to raise the level of heat because it's honestly not as good as it used to be.</review>

<text>The absolute best ramen I've found on Sawtelle. I prefer this location to the annex, as they use lime and the fish broth isn't overwhelming. Their staff is friendly and they know how to get you in and out without feeling rushed. If you're looking for ramen, there's a reason this place is always on the top of LA foodie lists.< /text>< pics>

Keep us waiting in quite a long que and 1 hrs+ time in a not warm day. In fact the smell is not easy to accept, I know it is the correct smell for this kind of noodle, someone like it very much and others are just the oppsite. Anyway the experience is special indeed. haha<//Review>

<text>Legit tsukemen ramen! This will leave you full and satisfied for sure. I used to never enjoy ramen all that much because I'm never full afterwards like I am eating pho...but oh boy, this place is quite the opposite.

We ordered the Tsukemen Ramen with Chaw Siew. They give you a solid amount of thick and perfectly cooked ramen noodles. I'm a sucker for the thick noodles, thin ones just don't do it as much for me. Next to the heaping bowl of noodles is their awesome creamy and rich broth.

With Tsukemen, you dip the noodles into the broth and then consume. The broth isn't meant for you to slurp on like other ramen bowls, which makes this a somewhat fun experience eating. The broth itself has scattered pieces of meat inside amongst other things and very flavorful overall.

The ramen also came with a softboiled egg which is obviously very tasty. We ordered sake on the side as well.

Overall a pretty good place to get yourself a bowl of Tsukemen Ramen and a nice family ambiance inside. Highly recommended! There is apparently also another restaurant that is EXACTLY the same across the street to help with the popularity and wait time.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I like this place a lot more than the Annex next door.  The ramen here is somehow better but it is a little oil.  Don't say I didn't warn you!

I got the dipping ramen when I went and it was great!  Nice pieces of pork, good amount of noodles.  You get your bowl pretty fast too.  Probably within ten minutes of ordering.

There are a few add on options you can get but the dish really doesn't need anything extra.

I would come back.< /Text>

I really wanted to love this as much as Tsujita LA across the street but I didn't. There was more than a fistful of bean sprouts which made it seem like It's the focal point. The noodles and the broth should be the star, not the dirt tasting bean sprouts.</review>

A deep and complex broth with pork fat as the main flavor, accompanied by spice and vinegar for contrast and additional flavor in this place's amazing tsukemen broth. Combined with some of the best, springiest ramen noodles I've ever had, the sometimes 1hr+ wait is worth it. Cash only, parking in the Marshall's plaza 1 block down Sawtelle or along the side streets</text>

Tsujita is known for their tsukemin, which is a bowl of ramen noodles that are dipped into a rich, concentrated broth before each bite.  After finishing the noodles, you are offered the option to mix a clear broth into the rich broth so that you can drink up the rest of it as a soup. The broth at Tsujita is hearty and has a great depth of flavor and the noodles are "springy" and thick -- perfect!<//Text>

Stopped by late in the evening to see what all the hype was about and the trip was worth it.  I ordered the char siu tsukemen and devoured my meal very quickly.  The dipping broth was very flavorful and they dilute it into a soup once you've finished your noodles.</Text>

<review>Mixed review for me. This was my first experience with Tatsu ramen. The flavor was very good, but the broth was room temperature...once mixed with the cold noodles, it was cold mess. Not a fan.

I also ordered a spicy ramen which was excellent. Piping hot and a wonderful aroma and flavor. Chili peppers added additional heat, but not too much. I ordered a spiciness of 2 out of 3.

Bad part - server spilled a quarter of the piping hot ramen all over my leg. She helped to get napkins and clean her mess, but did not compensate me with a discount or any other offer. Not an ideal way to treat your customers.

All in all, a good noodle house, but nothing out of the ordinary or exciting. Small, cramped quarters without any charm or pizazz.</review></record>

I love their heavier, creamier, spicer Tsukemen Ramen.  It is a fun experience to dip cold noodles into a hot broth with lime on top.  The food is good, but it is very heavy so you may end up sleepy by the end. The wait for the place can be bad.  Expect to wait up to 2 hours.< /Review>

Easily the best Ramen in town. Their Tsukemen ramen is perfection with thick ramen noodles, perfect soft boiled eggs, tasty fatty pork and the best creamy broth. I love that you can ask for more broth for free.</text>

I got the chasu that had pork belly with the noodles and bbq pork+bamboo shoots in the broth. Plus a tea marinated egg. Pro tip, when you run out of noodles and have broth left over have them bring some hot water to enjoy the remaining broth soup style. Also, there's typically a wait but it's worth it and the patio is dog friendly, major plus.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f<//Gmap_id></record>

The best tsukemen (dipping ramen) in town. While it's a personal preference, I prefer Annex over the regular Tsujita that's across the street. Add a flavored egg, it's delicious!</Text>

I had the Sake Ikura Don which was great. I also ordered Tonkotsu Ramen and I'm not sure if I just haven't eaten at enough ramen restaurants but I didn't like the broth at all.. also they only take cash here which threw me off as well. I'm wondering if I would have had a better experience at their annex restaurant down the block<//Review>

As the one who knows the restaurant in Japan that inspired the owner of Tsujita - this resembles 'The Jiro' almost perfectly! Once after getting inside this restaurant, you may smell the flavor of pork belly - a.k.a. Seh Abura, pork back belly. Unfortunately you won't be asked 'Garlic?', instead, there's mashed raw garlic on the table for free!</Review>

<Review>It's good but don't believe the hype. Plus, when we finally got seated after 30 min they had no ramen broth only tsukemen. They failed to mention that until they sat us. I've had better ramen without waiting in a sea of hipsters.</Review>< user_name>

Best tsukemen in LA. The broth is hearty and amazingly delicious. Portions are huge. Expect a big meal and plan accordingly. Only takes cash, so bring cash< /review>

Get the Charsiu Tsukemen! They'll teach you how to eat it if its your first time! Noodles are cooked perfectly, the soup is tasty (though a bit salty). Get there early to avoid a wait. Parking is a hassle as its on Sawtelle.< /Text>

Tip before coming here :) It's cash only.
My second time eating here and both experiences were great! You usually have to sign your name and wait, but most people are pretty good about eating and leaving, so, it doesn't take too long for seats to open. I've waited no more than an hour, and it's worth the wait if so! The staff does get busy running around but are always willing to help and with friendly service too. I definitely recommend eating tsukemen with chashuu. So good!! They have a cute illustration that shows you the proper way of eating it and the waiting staff can explain too if you ask. Remember lime in the noodles! Then dip noodles into the broth. I would definitely recommend eating here if you want to try delicious, authentic tsukemen.<//Text>

Tsujita has irrevocably changed my views on ramen.

Any time my partner and I are in LA, we make at least one trip to Tsujita for ramen. It is well worth the often extensive wait.

The service has always been great and the ramen itself is simply superb.<//Review>

I did not like this place at all it was in the ramen that I tasted in Japan I was kind of disappointed and even though they have a different way of doing her mom and because they did mention that I just did not like it the taste of the ramen was for some reason fishy and it just smelled bad it kind of seemed like they added Dashi or even fish sauce to their broth. Just wasn't my cup of tea and I don't think I will go back to this place.<//text>

<date>1523321073081< /date><Rate>4</Rate><text>Have been meaning to try this place on Sawtelle for some time. Finally bit the bullet and went to Tsujita for my usual Sunday noodle lunch with my girlfriend.  I must say the food was great! I had the spicy pork ramen (have forgotten the official menu listing) and was pleasantly surprised at the firey heat that the level 3 spicyness brought with it. I mean by simply looking at the bowl you would think it were a normal pork ramen bowl, but one spoonful of that broth will let you know that looks can be deceiving. My girlfriend had the tsukemen (sp?), and was very happy with her plate.

Overall, this place is another great addition to the cuisine offered here in Little Osaka/Sawtelle. Be cautious as this restaurant is VERY popular so be prepared to wait if during peak hours. The taste is well worth the wait, and the pricing is fair.  Can't wait to return.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>/!\~CASH ONLY~/!\  Google photo is incorrect as of 2016-10-05.  The dipping ramen (tsukemen) is tasty and so is the ramen.  Very good, high quality broth and great service.  The annex is up (north) the street and to the right (east) from Tsujita restaurant.  There can be a wait list, and parking is tough - but it's worth it!  This place is cash only.< /Text>< GmapID>

If you're a gourmet foodie, this is the spot. Simple but heavy ramen broth, fresh noodles, and enough temperature to enjoy the warm bowl til the last drop. Theu give such large portions so its well worth the 45min wait.<//review>

<review>This is the place that introduced me to tsukemen - thick, cold, chewy noodles dipped in gravy-thick hot soup. Oh buddy, this is the good stuff. As I understand it each of their locations features a different style of broth (hence why there is a second restaurant across the street). If I understood my server correctly this location is fish and pork, and the Annex is just pork. Both are amazing (but I do prefer the Annex overall). Slightly more expensive than most ramen-ya but definitely worth it. Blows all of the hipster competitors out of the water. Don't forget to get soup wari when your broth gets low.

Some caveats: Cash only, but has an ATM. No vegetarian options as far as I know.</review>< pics>

You will have to wait an average of 30 minutes before you get your table at this this popular ramen outpost and it is well worth it. I ordered the Char Sui Ramen and the Spicy Tuna Bowl. The Ramen was very flavorful and cooked just right. I was also very impressed at how fresh the tuna. Parking can be a bit challenging so be prepared to look in the neighborhood for parking. Also make sure you have cash for this location.</text>

Great dip ramen! Very delicious and tasty. The noodles here are different than other ramen places. It's more of a thicker and chewy noodle where you dip it in a thick soup and eat it. The only bad thing is the normal wait is about 30mins or longer. They should implement phone -text wait system, therefore customers don't have to wait out in the cold.< /review>

<Text>Decent place for ramen. Expect to wait at least 30 mins for a table. Food is served quickly once you sit down. I had the char siu tsukumen. The pork is very soft and tender and the noodles are cooked well. You dunk the noodles into the pork broth and then slurp it up. The broth did a great job warming up the noodles initially, but quickly became luke warm and didn't do so well warming up the noodles after about 5 mins of slurping. The broth is full of flavor, but very concentrated. Once you are done with the noodles, ask the staff to thin out the broth to make it drinkable.< /Text>< Response>

First things first, they take your order outside so that the food comes as quick as possible when you sit down.

Since there is only about 20 seats they try to push customers in and out! (reminds me of my server days at a Japanese Ramen Restaurant)

This is an extension of the original restaurant across the street.

Regular size bowls were 10-12, and large were 14-16

The large size is huge! enough to share with someone so you can enjoy other items on the menu. OR get 2 large and split between three people.

The Char - Siu pork is tasty! head across the street for dessert at block heads! Sawtelle is like better than Little Toyko at this point!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

The only thing that keeps me from 5 stars is the parking in that aera. Very crowded, for good reasons, but expect to walk a couple blocks to get there.</Text><rating>4<//rating>< userid>

I finally got to try Tsujita! The ramen here is quite delicious. I can't say if its the same, similar, totally off as from the original Tsujita but I did enjoy my meal here. I got the Tsukemen with soft boiled egg (and asked for less salty from reading other reviews) . The broth is VERY oily - it made me feel super full for the rest of the day- I don't recommend eating this often but it definitely is a treat once in awhile. I believe the spicy sauce was what made the broth, mmm my tummy is just dreaming about how delicious it was :) The soft boiled egg wasn't really soft - boiled, I usually like it runny but some people may prefer it the way Tsujita makes it. The wait is long though, definitely be prepared!<//Text>

<time>1513122450249</time><rating>5< /rating><review>I don't want to overcomplicate this and write a super long review because it's pretty simple: DELICIOUS TSUKEMEN.

Note that Tsujita has two locations pretty much across each other. This is  the ANNEX. Both are great but if you prefer a fattier, richer broth then I highly recommend the ANNEX over the OG location. And yes, the line is equally long for both restaurants.

If you go during off hours, you'll get a chance to avoid the line but if you want to eat during normal lunch/dinner hours, then prepare to wait (like 1-2 hours). Also this place is CA$H only. The menu is pretty simple, highly highly recommend getting the tsukemen. The portion doesn't seem too big but it is really filling, because of that I recommend getting the regular size and then getting an a delicious tuna rice bowl add on :) Taste the broth alone and then add in a generous heaping of the chili and garlic because it tastes sooooooooo good all together. The tsukemen broth is thick, fatty, rich, savory and perfect for dipping your noodles in!

If you're a fan of noodles (especially chewy thicker noodles) then you have to try this place! It's worth the wait.</review>< Pictures>

I've only been for lunch.  The noodles are the best in LA.  Tsukemen or ramen are delicious, the service is efficient, music fun and the decor is refreshing.  I love lunch here, come early to avoid the lines.<//Review>

Delicious and beautiful food served in a jewel box. We had the smallest of the delightful omakaze menus for dinner, and felt that we would have been better off splitting one (allowed) and adding a few extra items. The Kirin on draft is a bargain.<//Review>

Love this place. Noodles (thick) are amazing so rich and tasty. The broth is very salty and fatty so newcomer beware to be overwhelmed with richness. The does broth has a unique smell because of the pork simmering for 60 hrs so dont be throwned off. Between the ramen and the dipping noodles i prefer the 2nd choice. There is more flavor.</text>

Voted number one in LA and it lived up to the hype! The ramen was so good. I ordered the tsukemen and the tuna don. The tsukemen is the dipping noddles where they give you a bowl of thick concentrated broth and you dip eat bite into the broth. The broth had a strong bonito flavor and wasn't overly salty. The noodles were also perfectly chewy. I ordered the tsukemen with the pork slices, but the normal bowls already have pieces of pork mixed into the broth so don't worry about not having meat. After you're finished with your noodles, you can ask for broth to be poured into your bowl in order to drink the tsukemen broth. This is one of the best bowls that I have had! It's alway great because it is open till late night!< /Text>

The tsukemen broth was too cold and lacked the right amount of vinegar for my taste. Somehow the annex location across the street is much better...<//Text>

Awesome joint for Tsukemen aka dipping ramen. You can add wari (extra broth) at the end for free. Table condiments are fresh garlic and chili flakes. In my person opinion, this place has a low noise level, which is great if you want to focus on the delicious bowl of noodles and watch the chef's expertly prepare them. No distractions, basically! The flavor of the broth and bite to the noodle will make you come back. Many ramen shops serve Tsukemen, but Tsujita sets the standard. Try their other locations for broth variations and table condiment variations. Other locations also have full menus with plenty of delicious Japanese options.</Text>

I am hesitant to say this, as there is limited seating, and this could only increase the amount of people eating here.

The staff is unbelievably efficient, taking orders from those waiting when the bill has been delivered to patrons inside . It's rare on LA to be treated to top notch food and service, in such an efficient manner.

Cash only, maybe a 10-15 minute wait to be seated.< /text>< Date>

First time having Tsukemen and this did not disappoint. Although not exactly ramen, I finally found something that I would placed over my favorite ramen joint (Santouka).

I liked the option to add garlic and spice powder to customize the taste of the broth to your liking. Since I like spicy food, I spammed the spice powder and it was all worth it. Noodles definitely stood out as it was nice and bouncy to the chew.

It would be better if the broth can be a lot hotter so that it doesn't go cold a few minutes into the meal. But I think that may be how tsukemen is supposed to be so nothing much to do there.< /review>

If you can't make it to the Tsujita across the street for Tonkotsu ramen (served during lunch only), come here and enjoy their Tsukemen. The noodles are thick and chewy, and the broth is delicious. Street parking available in the residential area.<//Text>

Good ramen and good amount of meat. But meat quality wasn't that good. Pretty tough. The soup was unnecessarily unnecessarily fatty. The actual taste of the soup base was not sophisticated.

Ramen dipped pork lard doesn't make Japanese ramen. Don't get fyped.</Review>

Don't get the ramen, pretty much a second bowl worth of bean sprouts and the fat dissolved in the broth made me sick to my stomach. People say the tsukemen is good and they may be right, but the ramen is disgusting.<//Text>

the service is super attentive for how small the place is

I love their noodles here. They aren't the typically skinny ramen style, they're plump almost like Udon. I always order the ramen with or without extra char siu. The broth is heavy and flavorful. The red seasoning is very addicting. The wait is always crazy. However, I do appreciate the staff taking your order before you get seated so you get your food shortly after being seated. Parking is also difficult so be prepared for that!< /text>

<text>his place seem really popular when I heard about it then once I tried it not sure if its really worth the drive from one part of L.A. to the other side for dinner at this place. I had the popular Char Siu Tsukemen Ramen. The broth was really salty and the noodles were cold even after dipping it in the broth to eat. The waitress told me that after I finish the ramen they can pour some hot water for the broth then you can drink it like a soup. I felt like this ramen was a lot of work to eat so I just pour some of the broth all over the bowl with the char siu and ramen so it was easier to eat especially if you're not good with chopsticks.

I found the chopsticks to be a struggle when some places don't have chopsticks that grip the food easily. I got my blouse dirty from the broth splashing on it. I suggest you don't wear nice clothes if you really want to eat with the chopsticks and am not good at using them. Plan on paying for parking if you dine on Sawtelle Blvd. Don't park at a meter when it might only be limited to 1 hour parking.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Time>1493695794443< /Time><Review>Too rich for my blood

Normally I'm a huge fan of rich flavors, really though, I stand in front of restaurants with a giant foam finger with dollar signs ($$$) on it...a true fan of richness.  But I'm also like Forrest Gump, "I'm not a smart man, but I know what flavor is..."  I just don't get it, why is there 736 UCLA students waiting out front every time I drive by? Don't you guys have to study or something?  When I was in college the only ramen I could afford was in a plastic bag ("mì gói" in Vietnamese).

Let me tell you where this rich flavor is coming from...

I ordered two ramen bowls because I'm a freakin' fatty.  Side note...I was called into a meeting at some hotel room last month and it was my whole family there with TV cameras for a fatty intervention.  I tried running but my thighs cramped up from the stress my stomach was putting on it and fell straight to the ground.

Back to the story...I took one of the bowls home to finish for my fatty midnight meal, put the rich "broth" into the fridge and when I took it out like 75% of it was coagulated fat! Enjoy kids.  Eat up and go study.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user>103741301531365324072</user></record>

I can understand why others like it so much. It's very flavorful and the noodles are what I would consider a step up from the supplier that the vast majority of places get their noodles from. But for me it's just far too heavy. Both the ramen and tsukemen feel like I'm ingesting liquified fat. The tsukemen is probably more enjoyable because you control the amount of broth and it is actually cleaner despite being thicker.<//review>

<text>Wait was very short (5 minutes) for one person on Saturday at 1:30pm. I got the ramen and the  large bowl was unexpectedly large but I was not a fan of the noodles. The noodles were almost like spaghetti by being very thick and cooked to a very al dente/firm texture. The pork was very soft and the broth was ok with some scoops of garlic. Ramen is also on the expensive side while the place is cash only. Also wasn't a big fan of the heaping portion of bean sprouts.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

One of the rice bowls has to be charged for the full price. We have to order four ramen to get 2 rice as sides???? What if we all want combinations? So we can't have three combinations or four combinations? It makes no sense. They also charge 5% extra for the "kitchen staff" added in the bill.<//review>< Pics>

If you're tired of Shinsengumi or Daikokuya, give Tsujita a try. For starters it's dipping noodles rather than traditional soup noodle. Do mind the line though; I'd recommend coming at non peak hours... Or if you have immense luck, come whenever.

So it's simple, come in, order the Tsukemen as that's what they're known for. The dipping broth and ramen come in separate bowls and may confuse you initially but take a look at the eating instruction manuel if it's your first time here or ask a waiter. Get extra limes and apply to the broth as needed. I enjoyed the ramen texture and the broth but be prepared for an oily broth. The meat was wonderfully made and practically melts in your mouth.

So the experience is probably novel for most people but it's definitely worth trying. The ramen is a little more on the expensive side though, and the broth cools down pretty quickly so it's best to eat as soon as you get your food. Cold ramen with cold broth is not pleasant at all. Oh and Tsujita is cash only so be prepared for that.</text>

Tsujita Annex's tsukemen is by far, the very, absolutely best tsukemen I've ever had. There is something sinfully delicious about the dipping broth - it is so flavorful that i was literally amazed with my first bite.

Dont make the mistake of trying to sip on this broth! it is definitely a dipping broth, but they will give you broth to dilute it out if you need to. I found that the portion was large, i was much happier sharing a large than trying to eat a medium by myself. Either way, I always leave feeling very happy and full.<//review>

Their dipping noodles (tsukemen) was freakin' delicious. Came on an early Friday night (5pm) and surprised that there was no wait & was seated immediately. Will be coming back here next time I'm in LA. The only complaint I have about this place is it's cash only, so beware... Bring cash!< /Text>

Great Broth for the Tsukemen!  The noodles have a perfect bounce that supplement the Tsukemen broth!  Definitely one of LA's best!   BTW, if you have a knack for hot (as in high Scoville units) and savory,  add some KARASHI TANAKA from the condiments section.</Review>

Perfectly balanced, it is truly sensational. Its served tsukemen style which is when the noodles come separate from the soup.

The broth is rich, fatty, spicy and is loaded with garlic. The noodles are thicker than standard ramen noodles. They are similar to udon but with the bite and texture of a ramen noodle.

If you want to know how this stands up to ramen in Japan, I can honestly say this is as good as the best places over there. I recently visited and made sure to eat ramen all over the country and Tsujita is as good as any of them. I have also taken many Japanese friends here and they confirm it's greatness!<//Text>< Pictures>

Every time when I go to LA, this is a MUST GO place for me! Guys, if you like ramen, you should come here and TRY! I like their Tsukemen! It's my first time having ramen with the noodles on a bowl and the soup on the other. It makes the noodles less soggy when we eat.

Talking about the Tsukemen, the soup is really strong and rich, which is a good thing. But last time when I went there, the soup was a bit too salty, but other than that, everything was PERFECT! The overall presentation is nice and I like the idea that they have one big piece of fried seaweed on the noodles bowl, which is perfect for a person like me, since I don't really like to dip the whole seaweed into the soup.

I will definitely try their other ramen next time when I visit LA!<//Review>

The tsukemen (dipping ramen), which is what it's known for, was pretty good here. Definitely a hype I would say though. The broth is very salty and heavy, but that's what real ramen is! Although the taste, I thought was mostly just salt instead of the actual flavor of the broth. The actual ramen was really good though, with thinner noodles and not as heavy broth as the tskuemen. If you're in the area, definitely check it out! Not something I would wait for over 30 minutes though. Also it was pretty expensive - $35 for two for a char siu tsukemen and a salmon over rice.<//Review>

Showed up 15-20min before the store opened on Saturday with Steph Y. and Emily R. I think we were the third group on the sign up sheet.

The service was fast and we only waited few minutes to be seated.

I got their tsukemen and it was so fatty and flavorful. I can see why it's so popular :) As much as I love ramen, fatty broth isn't my #1. It's def the best tsukemn I ever had and I do recommend it to all the ramen enthusiasts out there. The ramen is only available for limited time everyday (?).

TIP: Best time to show up is few minutes before they open. If you show up later you will end up waiting for a very long time. I think the service is faster when you're one of the first to eat.

Cash only!<//Text>

<review>Sawtwlle has many ramen shops, but tsujita is definitely one of my favorites! We usually come here around 9-10pm so there isn't much of a wait. Both the tsukemen and regular ramen tastes amazing.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1447828112187</time>< GmapID>

I had to find out for myself.  Yes, I got the tsukemen ramen with charsiu.  You have 3 different stages to eat the ramen.  First stage is just dipping about 1/3 of your ramen into the broth and eating it.  The second stage is to squeeze lime into your ramen and finishing your noodles.  The final stage is adding the soup wari into your broth.  I would have to say the second stage is my favorite (adding the lime into your ramen noodles).  The broth is definitely really good, but it is a little too heavy in my opinion.  For my taste, it can get a little too salty too.  The seasoned egg is okay.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>If you Google search "best Ramen in Los Angeles" a great many lists and opinions will point toward Tsujita. The Tsujita Noodles Annex resides just across the street from Tsujita proper with a more limited menu, sticking only to the ramen and tsukemen that people clamor for.

I wanted to love the Annex. As a fan of good Japanese ramen, I felt no need to venture further west than Little Tokyo, but no longer could I ignore the much publicized Tsujita. Once you get to the Annex, you walk up, sign your name on the list and begin the wait. After about a half an hour, our order was taken, and another half an hour later, our name was being called to take our seat in the restaurant. The most notable experience when walking into the Annex is the smell. I wish it was a pleasant one, however, it was, for lack of a better term, funky......something like dead animal, stinky feet, and cheetos. Apparently, it is the slow drawing out of all the lovely flavors that go into the broth that brings out this smell.

Being that our order had been placed long before, our ramen was out shortly after being seated. The ramen came, a heaping serving of bean sprouts atop. Traditionally, I like to dive into the broth before anything else when eating ramen. After doing so, I had nothing else to think but, "this tastes like liquid fat." It's definitely flavorful, but as fatty and salty as could be. Once you mix everything together, char siu, bean sprouts, noodles, etc., you see how it all works together, but alone, the broth is impossible to enjoy. Unfortunately, there were a couple other issues. The additions to the ramen were cold. Obviously the bean sprouts were cold, but the char siu and egg were also, which created an odd experience.

In the end, I can appreciate the authenticity of Tsujita's ramen, but it has not persuaded me to move away from Daikokuya.< /review><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>110704716013971109471<//UserId.><pics>None< /pics><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f<//Gmap_id><time>1447657329076<//time><username>Russell Saisho</username></record></dataset><record>

<review>Tsukemen is so salty and heavy. I guess that's the point since you just dip it and squeeze a little lime on it, but I could barely get past the first half of the bowl (and it seemed like everyone around us had similar experiences). To be fair I only waited 15 mins so if I had waited longer I'd probably hate this place.

The noodles (esp consistency) and soft boiled egg are good though so I'd be curious to try the tonkatsu in hopes of having a better experience!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Tsujita LA is the most fascinating ramen place I've been to.  For one, they only serve ramen in this particular restaurant at lunch time (11am-2pm) and you should expect a line if you don't come a little before it opens.  The ramen here is very milky and heavy compared to the other choices around.  Some people will not like it because it really bogs down in your stomach but the flavor feels absolutely delicious and the noodles are just the right size.  All-in-all, a great choice for more experience ramen adventurers.  (Expect to pay around $10 along with the ability to slightly add more ingredients).  There are also some other noodle options that I didn't have a chance to explore.

Parking-wise, as usual in this area, look around the neighborhood nearby or on the street.<//Review><time>1396153313685</time>< userid>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Not exactly a ramen aficionado but the soups were great. The wife had the ramen with egg and I had the tsukemen. Both were great and I loved the multiple flavors you get with the tsukemen when you do the lime, then add the wari soup to the broth when you are done with the noodles. I would assume most of the other ramen places only a few yards away are great too but the service is quick and the servers are super attentive to the customers so you can get in and out here. There is always a line when we walk by this place but it moves quickly.  There's even a second kitchen across the street if this place is busy. It seems the other ramen shop near the milk tea place is always full of college students who like to sit and chat for hours.<//review>< Pics>

Super-delish ramen! The tsukemen ramen is awesome and a must-try if you've never been here. It's very rich. One of my faves is the negi ramen when I'm not in the mood for all of the richness.<//text>

Tsujita’s smaller, less fancy, much fattier sister store across the street, I always thought Tsujita Annex was there for people to get ramen without the long waits and short operating hours of Tsujita ramen.

After my last visit there, I realized that the line here is probably just as long as Tsujita proper now, but it definitely does have it’s own taste, and I sometimes feel like I crave the fattier, satisfying taste of Tsujita Annex’s ramen.

I definitely think everyone should take the time to try both Tsujita and Annex at least once, because although they share in name, all the different types of ramen really do taste much different, and the prices are about the same. Definitely add some of the red peppers if you’re not afraid of a little spice! They definitely add a kick!<//Text>

<Text>Tsukemen ramen, you are so damn good!
I love dip ramen! Rich flavors, thick noodles had the perfect chewiness texture, and plenty of tender pork. Can't believe it took me this long to finally try it.

I was so stuffed halfway through my meal that I had to give away half of my noodles and some meats.

Tsujita is now my favorite place to go for ramen.</Text>< pictures>

<Resp>None</Resp><time>1363982499129< /time><review>After hearing great things about Tsujita on different web sites I thought I'd give it a try.  Came for lunch on a Friday afternoon at around 11:30am.  The place was nearly full already but I got a spot along the back wall.  Had the tonkotsu ramen with the egg ($15 - a little pricey for a bowl of soup but I got the fully loaded option).  I am not a ramen connoisseur by any means but I enjoyed my meal.  Apparently the marquee item is the tsukemen noodle dipping experience but I'm allergic to seafood so it's a no-go for me.

Service was super friendly and I didn't have to wait too long for my food.  When I walked out just after 12noon there were at least 20 people in line.  Overall I'm glad I tried Tsujita and I enjoyed my meal and would recommend to others but I'd be more inclined to try a new place before going back.<//review><username>JD Devan</username>< pics>

I came to this restaurant because I'm a huge fan of Jonathan gold. Typical Ramen in Los Angeles is pork broth and if it's a place closer to West Hollywood perhaps include vegetable broth. Fortunately the only place that I actually used fish broth, which I've learned was the traditional way of normal Ramen, is nowhere to be found in Los Angeles. So I had to still remain with pork broth even though I am banned from eating pork.but like Bill says in "King of the Hill", "I can't join a religion that restrict my diet." From a hose or this way and there's nothing good labor feel shame up and I do like all food. Any case when I approach this restaurant I was expecting more the same regardless of my admiration for jungle, the only Pulitzer Prize winning food critic which I think you one while he was working at the LA weekly and I would be before he sold out to Valley times… Again! Back on topic, the broth is very fulfilling it is thick it is delicious it does not have the smell of pork or pork fat I guess lard but I don't know the exact definition of lard, and the noodles are very much thick and fulfilling and chewy that you really enjoy it rather than feeling like you just bought a cuppa noodle at a restaurant. Oy vey! Now this with the diet that is all oily it's fatty but and it was overwhelming but in a good way so I have to say that I came out of very happy person and it deserves to have the long lines.<//Text>< pictures>

After seeing all the raving reviews, I decided to stop by to try the infamous Tsukemen. I am definitely a believer! I ordered the Char Siu Tsukemen not knowing that the broth already contained pieces of char siu in it. I was super hungry but it still ended up being too much food for me! I still ate it all though nonetheless. :) We came here when it opened and there was already a line! Arrive early if you don't like to wait. CASH ONLY!

NAY-- I wanted to try the sauces before adding them to my food so I poured some on to a spoon...found a bug in the tsukemen sauce. :X</Review>

<text>Having lunch here was actually unintentional. We originally intended on getting Tsujita Annex, where we're regulars. However, the wait for Tsujita Annex was 30+ minutes. We noticed that for once Tsujita LA had no line, so we decided there's a first for everything. We wondered across the street and were seated right away. I had pretty high expectations for this place since so many have raved about their delicious tsukemen.

I ordered the Ajitama Tsukemen (tsukemen with seasoned boiled egg). The tsukemen comes with a bowl for the noodles and a separate smaller bowl with the broth. I was disappointed that my broth was just lukewarm and had no spiciness to it. The broth was really rich (a little too rich in my opinion) and savory with bits of pork in it. The thickness of the broth was too gross for me to really enjoy it and should only be used to dipped the noodles. The noodles weren't has thick as the noodles at Tsujita Annex, but came with a lime wedge and a piece of nori. In my opinion the tsukemen here is nothing compared to the tsukemen that is offered across the street. At least now I can say I've tired this Tsujita, but I won't be coming back as long as Tsujita Annex is open.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I watched a documentary on Netflix where they had Tsukemen in Tokyo and I immediately wanted to have some. There's no other place in LA that's better known for their Tsukemen than Tsujita so my boyfriend and I made our way to Sawtelle in crazy traffic just to sample some.

I had heard that the wait on weekends can be pretty bad here and I can see why. The place is tiny. They did open the Tsujita Annex diagonally across the street but I have yet to peek in there. Since it was a weekday, we were able to grab the last 2 spots at the counter.

I had the Tsukemen while my boyfriend had the char siu ramen. I didn't care for the broth on their regular ramen too much. I prefer richer darker broth.

As for the Tsukemen, when I had the first bite, I was a little overwhelmed by the intense bonito flavor of the broth. It was very seafood-y. However, after I added lime to the noodle as recommended, the flavor balanced out extremely well. I thoroughly enjoyed my ramen to the last bite.

The restaurant is cash only. Parking used to be a pain but they have free valet parking with validation now. It's located behind the building.</text>

<Review>I had never been in this restaurant before because I always thought It was going to be like the other Tsujita restaurant.

One day I felt curious and I went to the Tsujita Annex. What was my sorprise when I saw the menu was different...

I'm a very fan of tsukemen so I decided to try it. Totally different to the other Tsujita's restaurant tsukemen but really, really good. Maybe I prefer the other one but this one is also incredible.

Please, if you like ramen or tsukemen, whatever Tsujita restaurant is your place!! You are not going to be disappointed never!< /Review>< time>

<Text>They have a limited menu centered around Tonkotsu ramen and Tsukemen. While their ramen is quite tasty, it is their tsukemen that is their go to experience. Without going into detail, it is noodles served with a fantastic thick soup base in which you use as a dip for the noodles. There are instructions to enjoy the tsukemen in 3 stages printed on the menu. The friendly staff will again remind and explain the eating process after the food is served. Parking here is tough but if you don’t mind walking you can find some down one of the streets in the neighborhood, just mind the posted parking signs. This is a popular place so get ready to wait; this is a small restaurant with limited seating.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I love this place. It feels like I have been teleported to some Japanese izakaya and given a potpurri of options to chose from all at a very affordable price. A lot of subtle touches makes this place stand out from the insane amount of other izakayas. Overall one of my favorite places to eat authentic Japanese food.<//Review>

<review>First things first, you gotta know that the broth of the tsukemen and ramen is different than that of the Annex across the street. Lines are long, so I don't recommend going with a group bigger than 3. I went with a group of 8 and ended up waiting for 45 minutes even though our wait time was estimated to be only 20.

If you're coming here, try the tsukemen. The broth is more of a sauce that you dip the bouncy thick al dente noodles in. Get the 2nd option with the seasoned soft boiled egg. Squeeze the limes onto the soup to combat the dense fishy broth. At the end, ask for more broth (the actual soup) to dilute the dense sauce. Bring it home, and buy some ramen noodles from Nijiya to have yourself another meal ;)

I've tried the ramen, as well as the dons and I have to say that nothing compares to the tsukemen. The ramen broth was alright, but I hate the thin noodles that they use. I want my noodles to have a bite to them! The dons (Rice bowls) are $4 if you add them onto your entree, $6 otherwise.

How this differs from Annex: I can't finish a bowl of tsukemen because of how intensely fishy the broth is. I have as many friends who disagree and don't taste the fishiness as those who agree with my sentiments. I say taste the tsukemen from both restaurants. You can't go wrong with Tsujita!</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's a mixture of dirty gym socks and old wet clothes that haven't been transferred to the dryer for weeks. The rancid smell did not go unnoticed, but based on the Yelp reviews, we assumed that the smell must be coming from elsewhere, so we proceeded with caution.

They have two main Ramin options here - Tsukemen and Tonkotsu. The latter, the Tonkotsu, is a "specialty broth" that they make in house. There were four of us at dinner, three of us ordered a version of the Tonkotsu.

When the food arrived, the putrid smell overtook our table. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I tasted the soup; however, it tasted just as badly as it smelled.

I knew immediately that I wasn't interested in eating another bite. When we politely requested an exchange, the manager, Shanon, was called over by our waitress. He rudely told me that they didn't offer any "refunds or exchanges." I explained this wasn't a refund, because I had not eaten the soup. It was literally unstirred, chives still sitting on top of the rotten broth. After arguing for a few minutes with the manager, he was unwilling to remove this item from our bill. We paid for the items that were eaten with cash and proceeded to walk out the of the restaurant. We were literally chased out by the manager, telling us the cops were called and that we had to wait. This manager, Shanon, got in our face, tried to take picture of us on his cell phone, and stood behind our car so we couldn't leave. It was a frightening and appalling experience for four young girls.

I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you read many of the one-star reviews below, they all have the same thing in common, the disgusting odor. The service was so bad, that I would personally rather pay for you to eat lunch anywhere but here.

PS. I attended this establishment with a friend who is 50% Japanese, who had enjoyed Ramin countless times before. She too agreed the Ramin was inedible.< /Text><Name>Hope Horner<//Name>< Response>

My all time favorite ramen spot. I initially fall in love with this joint when they came to Mitsuwa in Cost Mesa as a popup restaurant for like a week way before Tsujita had a physical location in US. I liked their tsukamen so much that I came back to have the  ramen like 3 times during that week span. I had no idea Tsujita will arrive in west LA. My first physical store experience was actually bad. I tried both their tsukamen and tonkotsu ramen and they were beyond salty and they were horrible. This was few years back. Luckily I gave this place another try and I've been coming back ever since. I tried dipping ramen in so many other places but no ramen places remotely come close to Tsujita. The porkiest dipping broth that's been simmered for 72 hours and that tender noodle hit my spot every time. I cannot express enough love for this place.</Text>

<name>Steven Vong< /name><time>1431234737093< /time><rating>5</rating><review>The best tsukemen I've ever had and some of the best ramen noodles in LA.

I always walk by this corner and see a ridiculous line at lunch (they only serve ramen at lunch). I was extra hungry and took my lunch break at 12:45 instead of 1 and there happened to be a free seat at the ramen bar so I knew this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.

They have two options for ramen: Tsukemen (dipping) and traditional tonkotsu. From there you can choose chashu pork, no meat, eggs, etc. They also have some other rice dishes, but this artisan noodle stand is famous for the ramen so I went with the Chashu tsukemen.

My order came out quickly- they gave a generous portion of noodles and pork and a bowl of thick, saucey broth with a salty and perfectly gooey egg, bamboo shoots, and some pieces of meat. They also give you free lime and you can customize your broth with ginger, spice, tonkotsu sauce, and tsukemen sauce. The ramen was thick like spaghetti, firm and a little chilled. At first I dipped the noodles in the broth too long and it was way too salty. After swiftly swishing the noodles, I found the perfect balance between noodles and soup. The broth tasted even better after I ground some sesame seeds and added a little lime and tonkotsu sauce. The broth is what makes this place stand out from other ramen stands: they brew it for 60 hours with a wide variety of flavors that all combine to create an amazing savory sensation.

My only complaint is the price, a bowl of chashu tsukemen will run $15 without tip, but I was very satisfied with my meal and extra noodles and soup are only $1.50. Cash only. This place does live up to its hype and is simply a great ramen stand.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

A much-belated review: After being thwarted at the regular Tsujita (they were closed filming a TV show or something) I noticed the Annex across the street and thought I'd give it a shot. I didn't even know this place existed, but I'm so glad I it was there! It was around 2pm-ish so the wait was minimal, thank goodness--I guess it can get kind of nutty, judging from the other reviews. It's a small but comfortable place, with clean modern (but not sterile) decor. I was a little surprised upon reading the menu--it was a lot more Chinese-influenced than what I was expecting. I got the regular ramen with the soft boiled egg and the Ikura (salmon roe) bowl. I was intrigued by the Tsukemen but wasn't in the mood for it at that moment. This ramen is definitely different than the standard Japanese ramen--it's much more bold and rich, with thick, curly, chewy noodles--yum! I can see why maybe some people wouldn't care for it, but it suited my Korean palate very well, especially with extra garlic and spicy seasonings. The Ikura bowl was good, with fresh roe and rice. Nothing mind-blowing but exactly what I was expecting so it satisfied. I was very full at the end of the meal, but knew I wanted to come back sooner than later. I need to try the tsukemen next time!<//text>

Pros:
- creamy broth (so rich so delicious)
- dipping noodles for dinner (I think the original Tsujita only has this for lunch)
- tonkatsu ramen (I liked it better than the dipping ramen)

Cons:
- tiny tiny tiny restaurant means long wait for seating
- difficult to find parking
- pricey, especially if you choose add-ons (egg, green onions, seaweed, etc.)

Bottom line: I believe that a good bowl of ramen should be hearty and include an egg and other garnishings. If it's your first time, and you're feeling adventurous for tsukemen, try to get your friend to order tonkatsu ramen just in case you don't like the dipping style. That's how I ended up eating all of my dad's tonkatsu ramen and none of my dipping ramen...< /review>

*Thumbs up*
After a 2-hour sweaty hike at Peters Canyon, my wife and I made the 1-hour long drive to LA just to have ramen here. It was definitely a spontaneous thing, because I was craving ramen and I kept seeing Tsujita popping up in reviews.

Luckily we got to Tsujita just shortly after the 11am opening time, because by the time we left the place was crawling with people waiting outside. Of course, I had to have the $14 bowl of tsukemen... and for my first time, it was pretty awesome. Having the two separate bowls was a bit odd at first, but it came natural after a few slurps and honestly it made the ramen eating experience that much more fun.

Both the noodles are broth are #1 in my book, thus far. The noodles had a great chew and consistency, and just perfectly sucked up the broth. The broth is very thick (viscous is the fancy word being thrown around) and heavily concentrated in flavor. Although it was mostly pork based, the broth is just so heavy that the lime squeeze on the noodle is essential to cut through it all.

The chashu is more of the thick cut variety with the layers of white fat still visible. I thought it tasted great, especially after dipping it in the broth. The neon orange, ooey gooey yolk from the egg was just #yolkporn at its finest. Yes, that was a hashtag.

*Thumbs down*
Yep, $14 for a bowl of ramen is pretty darn high and I think the highest I've ever paid for a bowl of ramen. I think this tsukemen is fine for the occasional splurge. Taking it easy on the arteries and the wallet, I can't imagine eating it on a regular basis. Cash only is irksome -- it's not like this place is dirt cheap. They need to get with the times and accept credit card.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Visiting from the Bay area where most ramen places are just decent, I had very high expectations for Tsujita. The wait wasn't bad, about 30-45 mins on a Sunday afternoon. The shops around the area are fun to browse while you're waiting.

My friend and I both tried the tonkatsu ramen. OMG dat broth. So fatty, sooo GOOD. The char siu was also amazingly tender and delicious. The only con was the egg was a little overcooked. But I'll overlook that in this case, since the rest of the bowl was pure perfection. Best ramen I've had so far.

I will definitely be back, especially to try the Tsukemen next time!

Service was great. CASH only!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb74df48dd81:0xf5e9b108b806741f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This restaurant is a must if you are in the area for lunch, as they only serve the tsukemen ramen for lunch.

Get the tsukemen ramen with char siu pork! (I think it was $14. worth it!)

It comes with two bowls:
- one bowl with thick cold noodles, seaweed, lime, and thick slices of pork
- one bowl of thick broth with chunks of pork and the hidden treasure boiled egg ;)

I first took a sip of the broth.  It was very salty o_o
BUT... once you squeeze some lime on the noodles, dip some noodles in the broth then pull them out, it is so delicious :O !!!!

Despite what it looks like, it is a heavy meal.  The noodles are soooo good!  They have the right thickness so that when they are coated with the rich broth, the balance of salt and acidity with the lime is perfect.  The lime adds some freshness to the meal.

The pork slices are thick, and you really feel like you're getting a lot of meat with your meal.  My friend ordered extra char siu because he thought it would not be enough... but it was definitely enough meat without the extra plate.  Plus there's chunks of meat in the broth already!

Last but not least... beautiful egg.  I love you, egg.

PS: Line gets long.  Park in the residential streets.. or valet is available too.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I recently went to Tsujita for the first time as per a friends recommendation. The main feature of this place, as the name suggests is its noodles. As my friend informes me, they are now serve noodles every evening, which apparently they weren't before. What I had was the Tsukemen style ramen which is noodles on the side and ramen broth on a separate bowl for dipping the noodles into. The noodles are served cold and the broth hot. Because the noodles are cold, the broth eventually cools down. Unlike hot cooked noodles served in the magma hot broth, these noodles aren't crazy hot, so they are generally great in any weather, where's the magma hot ramen is more desirable during cold days, though not that hot weather stops me from eating any kind of ramen.
Over all, the noodles were good, the broth was thick and rich. I will definitely Tsujita again. Waits can be long, so be prepared.< /Review>

<text>I visited Tsujita for its famed ramen noodles when it was still just the new kid on the Little Osaka block. But honestly, I haven't been back since b/c the ramen at Tsujita just isn't as good as the competition. If possible, the ramen broth was TOO thick and not as drinkable as Daikokuya's or Santouka ramen. You might be better off visiting the Annex location across the street which does serve up a pretty impressive bowl of noodles.<//text>< Time>

After my trip to Japan, I've realized that this is as close as you can get to authentic tsukemen. If you never had it before, you're in for a treat. Tsukemen is basically just dipping noodles. You get a bowl of thick noodles where you dip into a bowl of thick pork broth. So good!

They even have a step-by-step menu that describes how to properly eat your tsukemen.

Order the Char Siu Tsukemen ($13.95) and you will not be disappointed. You get 5 big pieces of char siu. The portions are pretty big and I can never finish a bowl.

I love coming here on the weekdays because the wait is shorter than the crazy long lines you see on the weekends.

FYI, you can only order it during lunch-time. And it's cash only.<//Review>< Pictures>

Excellent Ramen, never had this dipping noodle style before, and I call myself a Ramen lover… disgraceful until now. Definitely any ramen fan should make the drive to get. You must try the TSUKEMEN (Dipping Noodle) Ramen with a reasonable amount of their ONIKASU (Red spice) it makes a world of difference.

Service: Excellent very friendly and professional always greeted, when you enter and thanked when you finish paying. Pretty standard I know, but hey! must be acknowledged.

Location: Well its LA so parking is always kind of a battle, I recommend you find a spot on the residential area a block down the street. If you have a big party, prepare to wait. They don’t take reservations nor hold spots, you will only be seated if everyone in your party is present.</Text>

<name>Craig Shiroma<//name><Review>Living in the South Bay, I'm spoiled by all of the great ramen places a short drive away. I heard great things about Tsujita LA, so I made the trek to West LA and it was well worth the drive. I ordered the ajitama tsukemen, which was the best iteration of this dish that I have tried. The noodles had the perfect texture and the broth was rich and deep with pork and umami goodness. The egg was cooked to a perfect soft-medium. I tasted some of the tonkotsu ramen that my friend ordered and I can say the broth is one of the best I have tried. It has a deep pork flavor with a subtle sweetness that takes it over the top. If you love ramen, this destination has to be on your short list.< /Review>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) delicious! I am very grateful to be able to eat tsukemen in the United States.
It's an image of thick seafood tsukemen, but it was lighter than I expected.
Tsukemen regular size, comic 24 dollars... It's a loss price so it can not be helped, but Japan is cheap.

美味い！アメリカでつけ麺食べれるのはとてもありがたい。
魚介濃厚つけ麺、というイメージだけど、思ったよりはあっさりしていた。

Japanese noodles have been eaten a lot. Japan has tried from the south to the Beidou. LA also has a lot of delicious noodle restaurants. This is a chain store with guaranteed quality.
First select the noodles at the counter and add the trolley to the cashier to pay, which is very fast.

(Translated by Google) Sawtelle, a city of Los Angeles, called "Small Osaka", Tsujita LA opened three noodle shops and a sushi restaurant on the same street in Sawtelle. It is simply a road tyrant. We come here and open at 11 o'clock, 11: 10 will line up. (I heard that since the opening in 2011, I have been lined up every day.) The 60-hour-boiled fish-bone soup is made with rough noodles. It may be because we don’t pronounce zu zu zu when we eat noodles. It’s really not good. The surface is too hard, the soup is too oily, only the egg is OK.

(Original)
Sawtelle, 一个叫"小大阪"的洛杉机日本城，Tsujita LA在Sawtelle 同一条街上开了3家面店和一家寿司店，简直就是路霸，我们慕名前来，11点钟开门，11:10 就要排队。（听说从2011年开张以来，每天都在排队）粗面加60小时炖出的鱼介琢骨汤头，可能因为我们吃面时不会发出zu zu zu 声,真的不怎么样。面太硬，汤太油，只有那只蛋还可以。<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Likes and dislikes seem to be covering up.
It's really delicious, but at the same time, I can't eat it until the end.
The party I came with is really delicious and I want to come again.
The staff was friendly... When you wonder what Tsukemen is, it's good to come and know your taste...! If the weighting is long, but it is more than 2 waiting lists in front, it is also recommended to go somewhere else.

(Original)
호불호가 가리는 듯 하다.
엄청 맛있긴한데 동시에 돼지 누린내가 나서 끝까지는 못먹음.
같이 온 일행은 엄청 맛있어하고 또 오고싶어함.
직원이 친절했음... 츠케멘이 뭔지 궁금할때 와보고 자기의 취향을 알아가기 좋음...! 웨이팅이 긴편인데 앞에 2 웨이팅리스트 이상이면 그냥 다른곳을 가는것도 추천 ㅎ 굳이 기다릴 필요는...<//review>

(Translated by Google) Although I don't really like ramen noodles in the first place, I sometimes "suddenly get nervous" and really want to eat it - I will do it today. But if I have a choice, I generally prefer to choose tsukemen.
This is definitely a popular ramen/tsukemen shop, and it’s so long. Order the dipping noodles ($17.95). It is said that the pork bone soup is cooked for over 60 hours.
According to the recommendations, there are three ways to eat dipping noodles. First, dipping noodles in the original soup is the normal way of eating. After eating 2/3, add some lime to dip the noodles 👉 I haven't tried this kind of food method, but it's all right, a few fresh. In the end, I add the remaining dipping sauce to the soup and drink it 👉 I personally feel that the taste is really strange, just taste it 😆.
Overall very satisfied. The noodles are springy, the soup is rich, and the taste is different from Japanese food. It is definitely a high-scoring choice!

(Original)
雖然其實我本來就唔係特別鍾意食拉麵，但有時都會"突然發神經" 好想好想食 —— 今日就係啦。不過如果有得選擇，我一般會更傾向選擇沾麵。
呢一間絕對係人氣拉麵/沾麵店，人龍成日都好長。 點咗沾麵（$17.95），據說豬骨湯頭係超過60個鐘頭熬製而成。
根據建議，沾麵有三種食法，首先係用原來嘅湯汁沾麵嚟食，即係正常嘅食法。食到2/3之後，就加啲青檸落去沾麵裏面 👉 呢種食法未試過，不過亦都唔錯，幾fresh 。而最後就係將剩下嘅沾麵汁加湯飲用 👉 個人覺得味道實在有啲怪，淺嚐即可 😆。
整體非常滿意。麵條彈牙，湯頭濃郁，味道同日本食嘅冇乜分別，絕對係高分數之選！<//Review>

(Translated by Google) This is the mainstream Tsujida. It seems. There is a Tsujida-style ramen shop across the road, but be aware that the concept is different. This is a seafood and there are pork bones! I was aware that.

The thick seafood-based soup and the solid thick noodles are the best. If sour is added, the soup will feel mellow, and if you notice, you will quickly lose your noodles and you will always regret that you didn't make it medium.

It may seem relatively crowded, but if you write a name, the order will come very quickly.
Also, Sudachi can get two if he wishes.

(Original)
こちらが本流のつじ田。らしい。道路挟んだ向かいにつじ田表記のラーメン屋さんがあるけど、コンセプトが異なるのでご注意を。こちらは魚介であちらは豚骨！と自分は認識しておりました。

魚介ベースの濃厚スープとしっかりコシのある中太麺が最高に美味しい…。すだちの酸味が加わるとスープがまろやかに感じられ、気付けばあっという間に麺が無くなってしまい、中盛にしなかったことをいつも後悔してしまう…

比較的混んでいるように見えるかもですが名前書いとけば割とあっという間に順番がくる、はず。
あと、すだちは希望すれば2つもらえる。< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The noodles and ramen noodles taste good, the noodles are elastic and the amount is very good, and the taste in Japan is very close. The porridge ramen soup is rich but not overly greasy, plus a small spicy taste, it is refreshing and not greasy. The newly released grapefruit bubble water is also delicious and refreshing, which is very suitable for matching ramen or noodles.

沾麵和拉麵口味都不錯，沾麵麵條有彈性，份量十足，和在日本當地吃到的味道十分接近。豚骨拉麵湯頭濃郁卻不過度油膩，加上小辣提味，吃起來爽口不膩。新上市的柚子氣泡水也很美味清爽，很適合搭配拉麵或沾麵。< /Review>

This is the case of what is happening to the other servers, so I gave it to the other server to give a bowl, said that the woman almost ate a new saying, but we were so sorry to have to take this also ㅡ ㅡ Tsukemen delicious, I do not know why you're famous.

Unfortunately, the whole family had a pretty bad diarrhea and suffered for about 3 days. Once I examined it, I used to have a group food poisoning.

<review>(Translated by Google) The shop is beautiful and the taste is a little light. It was just good for me who is not a Girorian.

And it is a Kanto person, so maybe the smell of the pig is too strong
