One of the most reliable plumbing services in the peninsula. They do a really good job and are value for money. They are not the cheapest but surely one of the best. We have used their service a couple of times and each time they were excellent. In a recent engagement they made sure the problem was resolved even if they had to make multiple visits and did not charge for a follow-up visit again like many plumbers tend to do. Overall, highly recommended.</text>

<Review>Both Marco (owner) and JR (plumber) were very professional, friendly and courteous. They were prompt in coming out to address the blocked sewer line, explained the repairs involved and performed the work efficiently and accurately. I’ve also had JR come out to my place once before for a leaky toilet which he just adjusted some settings and did not charge me anything!! Now, that’s what I call ensuring a return customer. Thank you, JR and Handy Plumbing Man.<//Review></record>

<Time>1620911223523</Time><rating>5<//rating><review>Brantson is a reliable plumber. He did an amazing job installing our two toilets. He initially came out to look at a crack in our ceiling that we feared was a shower or toilet leak upstairs. When we discovered it was actually just a crack in the title grouting and could be remedied with some simple caulking, and didn’t charge us for the visit. We agreed to have him return to replace two toilets. He was communicative throughout the process and let us know ahead of time that his previous job was running late and he might be slightly delayed. Highly recommend Handy plumbing.<//review>< Pics>

<review>I recently used Handy Plumbing Man to help my tenants with an faulty shower knob (preventing them from taking hot showers).  The experience with the company was top notch.  They were able to provide service next day.  The tech that came out was knowledgeable, timely and extremely professional (thank you David!).  Communication with the office staff was excellent as well.  Overall I couldn't' be happier with the experience and I will absolutely use them for future services.  I highly recommend!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< review>
Very grateful to Marco, David Y., and the team at Handy Plumbing Man! I'd been calling around looking for someone to help with a backed up main line, which was affecting my apartment and the neighbors' place. The pressure had caused the wax seal around my toilet to break -- so there was dirty toilet water leaking all over my bathroom floor. The first place I called said they couldn't do anything beyond a localized stoppage (basically all they can do is plunge your toilet for you, apparently?!). Then I called another place that was like "let me look at our schedule and get back to you" -- no call back for over an hour. So I was frantic to find someone. What a different with Marco! He answered right away and immediately reassured me that they could handle it and then got us on the schedule. David Y was on the site within an hour of the call, and had fixed everything before noon. Don't waste your time with other plumbing outfits like I did. Save yourself the time and anxiety and start here!! So grateful to their expertise, patience, and professionalism.< /review>

<Review>Fast, professional response; easy scheduling; on-time arrival; and an efficient and effective job done all combine to make Handy Plumbing Man our new go-to plumber! I loved the high level of confirmation and automated reminders, particularly after a previous plumber failed to show up when scheduled. I really appreciate the professional approach (and having a working drain again)!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Jose was extremely professional and knowledgeable. He was able to fix our issue in a matter of minutes. Aside from that he arrived within the window of time provided, notified us when he was on his way and shortly before he arrived. I would not hesitate to recommend him or this company to anyone in the area. Thank you!</text>

In attempting to replace my kitchen sink's leaky pull-out sprayer hose, I broke the hard to turn shut-off valves under the sink when applying some force to turn them to the closed position. When I turned them back on (after deciding to postpone the hose replacement pending investigation of how to take apart the hose connection, the pieces of which did not easily come apart as expected), the kitchen sink water when turned on full only dripped out slightly. Fortunately, these angle stop valves are designed to break in such a way that water does not flow through them. (Lesson learned: shut-off valves under sinks should be exercised occasionally to help them continue to function properly---several years without use can make them malfunction.)

Dave from Handy Plumbing was able to come the next day and replace the valves for a price agreed on in advance of the visit. He helpfully installed the new pull-out hose for us without any additional charge. Based on this very positive experience I recommend Handy Plumbing;  they will be our first choice for future plumbing needs.< /text>

JR came out, and in discussing the project, was very direct and honest about what was in my best interest. At this point, he had won many points. When it came time to lock down an estimate, he took matters into his own hands to figure out everything that needed to be known to prepare an accurate estimate, and was even able to give me a very competitive quote on the spot that sits at the top of our list.< /text>

Marco is bright, knowledgable, friendly and responsive. I called him for an estimate on fixing a hose leak, scoping my sewer pipe and installing a two-way clean out at my house. He fixed the leak and scoped the pipe the same day and gave a quote and schedule for the two-way clean out. When I found a better price for the two-way clean out he called me right back and offered to meet that price. His team is on-time. Does good work and cleans up. I'm very happy with Marco and his Handy Plumbing Man team.</review>

One of our office restrooms was experiencing a leak. JR was very responsive to my initial inquiry. Marcos was also, very responsive when I required additional documents and information. Unfortunately I was delayed in getting to my office and JR patiently waited for me. During the time spent here, JR was communicative and professional. Both technicians wore there masks as well.

Overall my experience working with Handy Plumbing Man was very positive. I will recommend them to other colleagues and highly recommend their services.< /review>

I’m incredibly pleased with my experience with Handy Plumbing Man. I had them install two faucets in my house (kitchen, bathroom), then they came back later to troubleshoot and successfully fix low pressure from one of the faucets. Honest work and fair prices. Marco is great and so is his team. Highly recommended!< /review>

<Text>Branston was on time, friendly and professional. When the disposal I had purchased didn’t fit, he had the perfect replacement in his truck and was done in under an hour.
This was also the only plumber who texted me back after the initial quote from Yelp, which was one reason I chose them.
Overall great service.<//Text>< user_name>

Jose, our plumber, was very punctual and come on time. He was very communicative and detailed. Jose helped me understand what the problem was and what we can do in the future to prevent it. He finished within an hour!

<Review>On Sunday morning, I sent message thru website and got the reply in 30min. Dispatcher said that the technician will be b/w 3-5pm. But he came here at 2pm. This is very good.

The outside sewer pipe leaked due to clog. He cleaned it in 30min. He also checked it by camera and found the damage of the pipe.

I really appreciate handy pluming man. This is my second time to use the service and both were very good.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Great experience with Marco and Jose at Handy Plumbing Man! I called for a leak at the base of my toilet, and the job was more complicated than I initially thought. I had some concerns about the price quoted since I didn't know anything about plumbing, but Marco took his time to go through my concerns. I also appreciated that he explained everything in detail and felt that after some investigation that the price quoted was fair. I also liked that the price quoted was the price actually paid. Jose was punctual and their text messaging system to let you know someone is on the way was super helpful. I'll be calling them for future plumbing needs! Thanks again!<//review>

<time>1597602440495< /time><rate>5<//rate><review>Had a blocked kitchen sink drain late on a Saturday night at my relative's home, 2 hours away from me.  Called on Sunday morning at 9 am.  The owner answered the phone and was courteous, helpful and said he could have a plumber out to the house within 2-3 hours.  He was fully informative, reasonable in his pricing and was totally available for questions and keeping me informed so I could communicate with my relative.  Plumber showed up earlier than expected, and I was advised when he was on his way.  Quickly resolved the problem and followed through with communication quickly.  Amazing.  Used technology to keep the customer updated and completely aware of all details.  Loved the service!!!  Handy Plumbing Man, LLC will be my first choice for a plumbing issue next time!!!!<//review>< Response>

I've used Handy Plumbing Man a few times and each experience has been as perfect as needing a plumber ever can be. They have always been very responsive, even at odd hours or on a Sunday when a water heater dies, quick to schedule an appointment, on par or cheaper estimate for parts/service, respectful and prompt service that is true to the scheduled time, and follow up if needed. I would highly recommend Handy Plumbing Man to anyone who needs plumber services.< /Review>

My service by Handy Plumbing Man was quite positive.  I called them and they answered promptly, they set an appointment for 8-11 AM.  Near 8 AM the service person called and said they were enroute.  I met the service person, showed them the job, and got out of the way.  After a while a large and long clump of hair was extracted from deep in the shower drain and the drain ran freely.  Handy Plumbing Man made the whole process quick and easy.s<//review>

Very nice to work with!  I had a shower back up in a vacant house, and called Handy Plumbing Man, LLC.  While I wasn't in a rush, they set up an appointment for their plumber (JR) to come out the next morning.  JR arrived on-time and armed with appropriate protective gear during these strange (corona virus) times.  He took care of the clog and explained the situation about my old pipes, and why they clog when not used.  He made suggestions but was definitely not pushy.  I will definitely use these this company again!</Text>

There was a clog in the drain and black sludge coming up from the pipes.  This was causing trouble with the garbage disposal.
The plumber was here within half an hour of the call.  He told me how much it would cost and it was exactly that.  He was wearing his mask.  He did a great job and he was nice and professional.  I would use them again.<//review>

We needed the kitchen sink to be unclogged. Every aspect of the experience went smoothly.  Carlos gave us a quote online, the repair person was on time, knowledgeable, thorough, friendly, and conscientious. He spent the time to figure out the root cause and to fix the problem.< /Text>

<review>Marco was very detailed and upfront about what his estimates were and I felt like he was fair in his assessment of my water heater leaking situation was. He was very transparent and I felt like I could trust his judgement. His team that installed the water heater was relatively quick as well.<//review>< Pics>

Marco and his crew are life-savors. Responsive, effective, timely, kind, pleasant and generous are some words I’d use to describe them. I really couldn’t ask for more and as a single mom and homeowner, it’s a relief to find the kind of support I’ve felt from being able to rely upon Marco.< /Text>

I called handy plumbing drain for a clogged kitchen sink. Marco picked up his phone on a Sunday morning. I had a family dinner and needed my kitchen sink to work. He came out very professional got to work and my sink was draining 30 minutes later. Thanks a lot I will definitely use him for all my plumbing needs.</Review>

I recommend this business and would use them again without hesitation. I needed to have the toilet wax seal replaced. Sewer gas was causing a foul odor. I spoke with five plumbers to do the job. Handy Plumbing Man provided a free completive quote and had an opening in their schedule to get the job done. They arrived on time, completed the task. No problems found straight forward job for a standard toilet (They disconnected the existing water supply, Removed the Toilet, Replace waste seal between toilet bowl and floor flange, Install new brass bolts, Re-Set toilet, Reconnect existing water supply and Sealed the base of toilet).

So the lady in the front desk was very rude when I got there. She ended up telling me half way through my visit she told me she wanted a urine sample from me. I leaned over a bit and told her if I had to do it because I was on my period. Very rudely she told me it didn’t matter to go to the restroom. The only thing I really do appreciate it was that when she was taking my blood and she saw my arm (as I did self harm) she told me there is help if I needed it and that everything will be okay. Only good thing that happened during my visit.<//Text>

The kiosk wasn't refreshing, meanwhile others came in, checked in and were seen right away.  The gal knew I was there first, I went to her to let her know the kiosk wasn't refreshing, and she didn't get up at all, instead she said yeah, it does that you'll just have to wait.  Attempted again went to her again, (still didn't get up), and she said it's not showing up youll have to do it agian. Finally tried a different kiosk, but didn't bother updating info. The techs weren't friendly either, and seemed annoyed when I asked 1 question about a test.  I'm not a annoying person, but I think about older people, would they even bother helping them?</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
Worst costumer service. I am nurse and I drop off specimens for patients constantly to different sites at lab Corp. This office on Bear Valley rd. and Apple Valley rd.  by far has the worst customer service I have experienced. I have visit more than 10 times and every single time the people who is at the front desk the worst. I would go off my way to avoid them but sometimes I have to due to time restraints. I am saying if you don’t like to do what you do, change professions, it is as simple as that.</review>

<review>Went early Friday morning for annual check up blood draw. Line as usual. Not to long of a wait. Had to follow Covid rules of course.
Signed in, not long before they called me back. Very friendly, professional staff. They took care of everyone pretty fast considering a line.
Thank you ladies for being amazing. See you again next year.</review>< pictures>

<rating>2</rating><Review>So the lady in the front desk was very rude when I got there. She ended up telling me half way through my visit she told me she wanted a urine sample from me. I leaned over a bit and told her if I had to do it because I was on my period. Very rudely she told me it didn’t matter to go to the restroom. The only thing I really do appreciate it was that when she was taking my blood and she saw my arm (as I did self harm) she told me there is help if I needed it and that everything will be okay. Only good thing that happened during my visit.<//Review>< Pics>

The kiosk wasn't refreshing, meanwhile others came in, checked in and were seen right away.  The gal knew I was there first, I went to her to let her know the kiosk wasn't refreshing, and she didn't get up at all, instead she said yeah, it does that you'll just have to wait.  Attempted again went to her again, (still didn't get up), and she said it's not showing up youll have to do it agian. Finally tried a different kiosk, but didn't bother updating info. The techs weren't friendly either, and seemed annoyed when I asked 1 question about a test.  I'm not a annoying person, but I think about older people, would they even bother helping them?< /Text>< Pictures>

Staff are not friendly at all.  Phlebotomist jennifer and joanne at the check in desk were rude.  Not sure if they are rude all the time or of its because we made comments about the check in kiosk which we don't really agree with because that's taking away your job.<//review>

Worst costumer service. I am nurse and I drop off specimens for patients constantly to different sites at lab Corp. This office on Bear Valley rd. and Apple Valley rd.  by far has the worst customer service I have experienced. I have visit more than 10 times and every single time the people who is at the front desk the worst. I would go off my way to avoid them but sometimes I have to due to time restraints. I am saying if you don’t like to do what you do, change professions, it is as simple as that.<//review>

After having multiple issues with the heating and A/C in our unit, Anthony was sent out to resolve the issue. I can say that, from opening the door, we were in the right hands. Anthony was beyond caring and courteous, very friendly. He had a mission to make sure my family would taken care of this winter and went above expectations. Very thankful for the technician you guys sent out, if another issue does arise I hope we can get the same level of care Anthony gave us.</Review>

The very next day Anthony and Jeff were at my house installing the new unit. Installation only took 2 hours and things were getting back to normal. They were extremely professional and courteous.

<Text>Christina and Joel were extremely pleasant at our household, and furthermore they were miraculously available during the heat wave (everybody else was booked out 2 weeks out or worse). Our first contact with air temp specialist was with Christina, who was extremely knowledgeable and diagnosed our AC issues accurately and precisely.
We’re very happy with the work and we’re happy to be in a cool home again.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1595872041056, 'text': 'Thank you for the review Monty! We appreciate the great feedback!'}</response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Josh and Ryan showed up on time and put protective coverings on our hard wood floors to prevent damage. They worked all day to install our replacement unit and installed the outside and attic equipment and new thermostat. It worked perfectly! But the big thing was the hideous temperature that day 108 degrees so you know in the attic area it was much much worse. Thank you for a job well done.</Review>

I was lucky , I found this company today !
I needed the second opinion, regarding our AC unit , the previous company that I used , they suggested to go ahead and replace the whole unit ( approximately $8,000) .
Christina the technician lady , showed up today , I was amazed with her professionalism, with her honesty , with her dedication and quality work she provides ! She saved us a lot of $$$ !
Just wonderful, wonderful Christina !

I totally recommend anyone, who wants the good quality , professionalism and honesty !
Absolutely amazing job !!< /Text>

We had Lawrence H. from Air Temperature Specialists come out recently and service an AC unit that we had almost all given up on. He had the unit up and running within 20 minutes and his customer service was unbeatable.   We will definitely be using Air Temperature Specialist again. Thanks again Lawrence!< /review>

I have to expand my review. The team at Air Temperature Specialist did a great job trying to save my old AC unit. We had to move forward with replacing our old unit. The work the team did was top notch and we got an extremely fair deal. I would highly recommend them to anyone.<//review>< Pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I manage commercial shopping centers in Orange County and LA County, and I've used Air Temperature Specialists to service, repair, and replace my (26) 3, 4, and 5 ton combo heat pump / ac units for over 5 years.  They are consistently competitive with their pricing.  When I check them against other companies, as I do once every three or four jobs, they are always at or below other estimates.  Plus, they are reliable, fast, and consistent.  I have replaced 8 large commercial AC units through Air Temperature Specialists, and they always do it well, and on time.  Their techs and their dispatchers are kind, respectful, and knowledgeable, with great attitudes.  I highly recommend them for residential or commercial use.< /Text><time>1539026004287<//time>< pics>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Date>1564686543999< /Date><Review>When I called on Monday that our AC unit was not working,  I was thinking they were going to schedule someone within the week (like other companies), but I was very pleased to hear that they were going to send someone the next day. Lawrence H. was able to fix it the first day.  However, the following day, the AC didn't turn on, so our technician returned.  Considering that we have an older unit, there were more complications where parts had to be replaced. He was able to change the parts with no extra charge saving us hundreds of dollars. Lawrence H. did a great job to resolve our problem and fix the AC unit...His customer service was impeccable...Kind, respectful, hardworking, and trustworthy.  I would recommend using this company as our "go to" with AC and heating issues.

Thank you,

I can not PRAISE Air Temp Specialists enough. After a HORRIBLE experience with another local plumbing company ( Plymwr Plumbing ), Mike P. was extremely polite, helpful, and most important FAST at helping us out with a month old problem.  Shawn the technician was just as friendly and helpful.......IF YOU EVER NEED A PLUMBING COMPANY, THESE ARE THE GUYS TO RELY ON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</text>

I had Air Temp Specialist replace an a/c & heater unit in my home several years ago. I reached out to Mike Poe on some work that was out of warranty. Mike and his crew went above and beyond to help replace a pipe that failed. Along the way, they were prompt, friendly and courteous. They come highly recommended, in my book! GREAT JOB! Thank you</text>

These guys are the best--hands down! From their scheduling to the service every step was seamless. They actually gave me a thirty minute arrival window; not the usual all day waiting around like most companies. Their plumber was kind and knowledgeable. I had the incorrect part but lucky for me he had a fully stocked van with the right equipment. This is the only company I'll use in the future!<//Review>

I had Air Temperature Specialist come to my home to work on my A/C which was no longer cooling my home. Air Temperature Specialist detected and repaired a leak in my system. The repair was done in a professional and timely manner and at a very reasonable rate. Technicians Tom and Brandon did a great job working on my system. Air Temperature Specialist is my go to company now and in all future A/C and Heating needs.</Review>

Shane came to our rescue. He took the time out of his busy schedule to fix our water heater problem. He knows how hard it is not having hot water in the house. Shane came in a day earlier than scheduled and fixed the problem in no time. Wife is happy. No more boiling water in the pot. Yippee!< /text>

Wow, no one likes to hear you need a new HVAC system BUT everyone we dealt with at Air Temperature Specialists made the entire process actually enjoyable.  From the office staff promptly setting up the initial service call and the inspection where Brandon showed me where gas was leaking, to the immediate price quote and installation (by Chris, Mike and Brandon), we were delighted.  What we were most impressed with is it was a 3-day process (we did the water heater as well) and we were always called (or briefed while the men were here), on the processes and time lines.  I  say that because these days we're at the mercy of many contractors who are late and or fail to return calls.  We also liked the way they kept the job site (our home) neat and orderly at the end of each day.  In a word....outstanding!</review>

<Review>Anthony and David came to our house today. We’ve been having AC issues since last year and didn’t want to go through another summer sweating with an underperforming AC system. They quickly replaced our HVAC unit inside and determined that our Main unit outside was overcharged and was causing some major issues. They resolved everything and also replaced our wall thermostat unit. Now I feel completely confident that we’ll be nice and cool this summer. Bravo Zulu to both of them!!<//Review>< pictures>

We had another air conditioning service come out to just do a seasonal maintenance special and they told us our entire unit needed to be replaced along with the ducting...for thousands! They actually caused damage!  I called and asked for Brandon to come out again because he had helped us earlier in the season with a small problem. He was able to fix the problem quite easily and saved us a fortune. When it truly is time to replace we will definitely use Air Temperature Specialists. You can trust them and they are very professional. I highly recommend them.</Text>

Shane again saved the day.
I'm head maintenance for a large, ageing senior community in Hemet. He is quick, thourough, and leaves his work space cleaner than he found it.
Air Temp is who I use consistantly because of him and his team.
I will not say I look forward to another breakdown but I don't worry anymore!< /review>

The couple working we're having a argument as I walked in. The Asian lady was super rude and disrespectful to me as I was asking questions and trying to order. I told her to give me a minute but she started yelling at me for no reason. I let the lady behind me go first so I can choose a drink but she kept yelling at me. Horrible service. That lady needs to be fired. Should not take her anger out on customers and leave your fights / arguments at home. Learn to be professional. Horrible lady. Will never come here again. Also I just checked they haven’t met of the inspections. Dirty place< /Text>

I will never visit this place again. The woman at the counter got my order wrong and I tried to tell her as she was making it. She responded rudely that she heard me and proceeded to give me the wrong drink. Then when I told her it wasn’t the drink I ordered, she began screaming that it was MY fault and she didn’t want to remake the drink. She was super nasty. I told her she didn’t have to worry, just make my drink correctly and I’d never come back.

This was the weirdest experience I’ve ever had at a restaurant. I was with a friend so it was quite embarrassing but I will be sure to never come back here again.< /Text>

<Text>So many other places to get boba. The woman behind the counter is extremely rude. She argued with another customer ahead of me about her boba order. Instead of making a few new drinks. She refused to correct the order and refused the customer a refund. The the woman tried to tell the customer she ordered wrong and absolutely refused to remedy it. I feel bad for the customer. The behavior from the woman behind the counter was uncalled for and unprofessional.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

yay its BOBA TIME !! 🥤It was my first time coming to this place. Parking is awkward but it's one of the closer boba locations to Culver City. I was able to order pretty fast, food was ready in under 10 minutes. (plus a convenient smoke shop nearby)

We ordered (1) Taro Slushie w/ Boba, (1) Jasmine Milk Tea w/ Boba, 3 Taiyaki w/ banana nutella filling, and Beef Steamed Dumpling. Everything was really good but I do have complaints; part of the Taiyaki was undercooked while others were fully cooked..still good and the boba was bland. Thats about it, the steamed dumplings were a surprise little hit for us. We enjoyed them very much.</text>

After they told me it was almost ready they came to ask me what I ordered when they supposedly said it was already being made. Don’t waste your time go to another boba shop. Not to mention the lady working there is extremely rude and yells at you!! I<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>0 stars if I could. The lady there made 2 Taro Teas when I said 2 Thai Teas. She tried to tell me "when people say thai, they usually mean taro". She was determined to say it was my fault, no refund and no new drinks unless I paid again for the correct Thai teas. After reading so many terrible reviews with similar problems, I can absolutely validate that they are legitimate. This woman was awful.</Text>< pics>

<text>BEWARE - We came in almost an hour before they closed per Google. We ordered a drink off the menu and the lady said "we don't have that here". She then kicked us out of the store because she didn't want to make anymore orders for the night and because we ordered something that wasn't on the menu (it was actually listed right on her menu)

It was really weird. This lady is very very rude/unpleasant.

Will never return.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Go somewhere else! The woman there made me the wrong drink and tried to argue that I DID order it. She said if I wanted another I had to pay for a new drink, then she ignored me. I asked for a refund and she said (without looking at me) No refund! The other customer looked shocked at what just happened. Seriously???< /Text>< user_id>

Boba slushie was so watered down on flavor, I might as well be drinking sugar water... owner insisted that we spend $15 to use a card... since no cash was on hand & we didn't want any other item on the menu... a 50cent charge was rendered instead. After a long day of working outside my Nephew & I were craving Boba, this place disappointed on taste & frozen boba balls. Don't waste your money.< /review>

I agree with the other reviews here. Their boba is more water than ice not a slushy and its not as cold. The inside of the place is nice and clean but their boba, I won't be coming back.<//Review>

<text>The  lady at the store was extremely Rude. I frequently drink from boba time at other locations, which is why upon taking one sip from my drink from this location I was able to tell it was made with poor quality. So I politely informed the server. She was very dismissive and confrontational with our opinion, as if she didn't believe us. So we asked for a refund and she refused for 10 minutes saying everyone likes her boba and we didn't know what we were talking about. I was confused because it was me the customer that was trying to defuse the situation while she antagonized. It's safe to say I won't be supporting this location again. It's also important to note that I was dressed casual since it was raining and it seemed as though she was treating me based off my appearance instead of my character. It's a shame I have to go through this in 2021.</text><gmapID>0x80c2bbae0db7f63b:0xd4c0580fde06e070</gmapID>< user>

I went Saturday morning excited to get a boba at "Boba Time" but they didn't have Bobas. Huge disappointment. The following 3 items i ordered, they were also out. No shaved ice, no fish waffles... The pre packed pastries i tried belonged more to a 7 eleven. Not good. I am giving them an extra star because the smoothie I ended up getting was good, but I should have given it 1 start. I wouldn't open a shop with this name until the Bobas are ready. No matter how long they need to soak.< /Text>

Great boba place on way to the airport if coming off the Highway 1/ PCH (Pacific Coast Highway). Open at 9:00am but no boba until 11:00. Can still buy tea and pastry case things. Cute decor. Seating inside. Ramen.<//text>

I'm a regular here. I live in this neighborhood and pay a visit at least once a week. 've tried a few things but jasmine milk tea and Honey Lemon are my go tos!

But yes expect super slow tea making by super no-rush chill out servers. 10-15mins wait for an order. Every single time.....< /Text>

Aweful Boba, I don’t like leaving negative reviews cause I know it can effect a business and its employees ... but I felt the drinks felt like powder in water, flavor of the tea was off and the boba felt like hard clumps of starch, I couldn’t drink much of it.... not to mention the owner has a very bad attitude... I can’t go here ever again...</text>

<text>I really want to like this place since the idea of a flavored boba can't be beat. The location itself is clean and pleasant and they have a few games you can play like Connect4. How cool is that!? My issue here is the menu is too big and it takes a while to scan the entire menu and figure out what to get. I was here within the last week about an hour before closing. The guy working there barely spoke or acknowledged me. Zero personality...<//text><Rate>2<//Rate>< response>

<text>I waited for 20 - 25 minutes at this location on a Saturday. The place was somewhat busy so I thought it was due to that. I finally got frustrated and approached the counter only to see my order there. If you're going to go to this location and you can't sit near the counter, stand near it instead. The timid girl at the counter speaks with the volume of a mouse.</text>< pics>

<text>HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!
The lady working (supposedly the owner) started screaming at me when I kindly told her my order was incorrect. She actually screamed at me in front of a few other customers; she told me that I was wrong. She refused to make me my correct order. The owner is aggressive, ignorant, and disrespectful.
Also,
Place: NOT a chain of “It’s Boba Time” & dirty; Drinks: watered down & overpriced; Boba: not sweet, undercooked, & clumpy.
Volcano Tea, I will be visiting you often!

<time>1574546144287</time><Review>Not bad for being like the only boba place in palms but since I'm from the 626 I have definitely had my fair share of boba and this one is ok. It's located in a small strip mall which has free parking which is awesome in West la. I had the yogurt smoothie which I thought would be like yakult flavor but it was actually using plain yogurt which I didn't mind because I love yogurt. I also liked how it wasn't too sweet. So if I was really craving boba I would go here but otherwise I would probably rather go to boba guys.< /Review>< UserId.>

I ordered the Charcoal Crispy Rice soft serve on the charcoal cone which would've been $6; but they had a happy hour 3-6pm tues-fri so it came out as $4.80!

It did melt pretty fast, but it tasted pretty good! I loved the charcoal cone, which was very crunchy and perfectly sweet.</text>

The Asian lady is so rude! They had made my drink wrong and when I asked if they could correct she said no because they basically lose money when I asked for a refund she was trying to give the same drink just trying to say we added chocolate that's why it looks like that. She would rather lose a customer than to make the order right. Don't even bother going there the drinks aren't even that good! Go somewhere else where you can get a better drink and better service!<//Text>

<Review>Horrible drinks. Boba milk tea tasted bitter in some parts and sweet in others, and the actual boba were slimy, mushy, and tasted like mothballs. They also had a $15 credit card minimum (???), and the cashier was unpleasant.

We really disliked this place for 3 reasons:

1) Boba slush was like a dollar more than other places. That’s not bad in of itself but...

2) This is the longest I have waited for a boba. There were like 3 other people in the whole store.

3) My boba slush had HUGE chunks of ice in it. Why did I pay a dollar more than most places for huge ice shards??

The employees were not friendly either. No smiles, no greeting, nothing. I will happily go somewhere else next time.< /review>

<text>I swear this used to be a Its Boba Time location. My dad used to stop by a lot and even had cards but I could be wrong. One thing I do remember is him saying "I hate that location". Ordered a strawberry coconut smoothie, it tasted good but not the same (obviously). 5 mins later (less maybe) it felt as if it was just milk with ice. Knockoff boba time has let me down...<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

The boba here is surprisingly good. Lots of selection and flavors. The parking lot gets packed quickly, but there is additional parking in back. They have a 5 dollar minimum to use credit card, and even then the lady will sometimes try and shame me out of using my credit card.<//Text>

Garbage garbage garbage... This place use to be really good until they hired this young kid that doesn't know how to make drinks nor does he know how to give you the correct change back.....I suggest if you want a drink from here don't have high expectations, they need to fire the night staff and get some people that know what they're doing.</review>

I rarely write reviews, taking the time today because I've had a very unpleasant experience. I used to go there regularly, and last time I went, my loyalty card got its 10th stamp.
Today I go and want to use my card to get the free drink and the owner takes my card and says it's already used???
How can it be used if I still have it, with the 10 stamps?
I didn't feel like arguing, given that we're talking about a couple bucks.
It just was the last time I went to this place, given how they treat regular customers.
Disappointing.
Side note - the drinks are inconsistent, sometimes too sweet, sometimes the tea has infused for too long.<//text>

I LEFT THIS PLACE IN A REALLY BAD MOOD. The woman was COMPLETELY without patience with my Godmother’s son that was with me. I didn’t have any cash, just debit/credit card, she charged more, until there I “understand” after, my kid was trying to make a roll with the straw and she was super impatient, and kind make a face for the next costumer. I’m not going back there. NO WAY</text>

September 18, 2017 Just tried this place out for 2 yogurts at $10 dollars. The YOGURT tasted like SOUR MILK, I love yogurt and this was very spoiled product. When we asked an Asian lady about it so she could fix it, she tasted and said nothing is wrong with it. We simply let her keep her money and placed the two yogurts on her counter and politely walked out....we went to another place and ordered a fresh yogurt.....we will NEVER go back to a Boba Time again......thanks but no thanks!!!!!!!!!!!</review>

<Text>11/2017 Got a delicious Taro Boba Slush for less than $5 and they have free WiFi plus outlets!

10/2016 They have so many flavors here!! But they don't start serving boba until 10:30, even though they open at 9am :/ What a bummer...at least they have Belgian waffles on the menu too!!! ;) love the decor<//Text>< name>

First off this place is a complete rip off of “its boba time”. They even copied the menu to the point where it looks exactly the same. The price for my drink was wayyy too much. Lastly, they messed up my order giving me a drink that was nothing close to what I ordered. (The kid at the cash register even repeated my order back to me so I don’t understand how he messed up) On top of all that they did not even put extra boba in my drink like I asked and PAID for. Overall such a bad place. I would not recommend it.</text>

I've been here twice and the last time I was here, the lady got my drink wrong - I asked for no boba and I did not taste MATCHA at all - and forgot about my popcorn chicken. I've been waiting for around 15 minutes when she probably realized that I'm waiting for my order, so I had to wait another 15 or so. You'd be hoping the popcorn chicken would be worth the wait but nope it's not. They have this weird tasting ranch and hot sauce? None of the sweet and sour sauce that usually comes with popcorn chicken. I thought maybe they were trying to be different but both sauces did not work for me. I'm really disappointed. I think the only holy grail is it's cheap.< /Text>

They only have ONE person working there, an overworked and probably underpaid Mexican dude, who did not acknowledge me and at least take my order while he made a group of 6 teenagers to get their drink. Like at least take the order even though I would have had to wait OBVIOUSLY. He just expected what I'm nice and wouldn't mind? Terrible service. Owner should be ashamed.

Small boba shop in a strip mall. Large selection of drinks and desserts with a few food options.

Staff was friendly and boba drinks were ok. Nothing great but refreshing.

Got a shaved ice bowl and it was ridiculously sloppy and sweet but for some reason it hit the spot! Did push me over the edge in terms of prediabetes! Lol</Text>

Awful garbage. Don't come here unless you want to pay high prices for a drink that you probably won't be able to finish because it is just garbage.</Review>

I ordered the Ippai Grapefruit Tea with 50% sugar ,The drink is quiet refreshing and the tea is green jasmine tea which is just perfectly match with the grapefruit,I finished it in 15 mins , I'm pretty sure they used fresh grapefruit because I found some crushed seed inside .

And there is a free parking place behind the building !!!< /Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Milk tea tastes good. We're not very serious about our taste... but the duo is also famous.

밀크티 맛 괜찮아요. 아주 진하게 우린 맛은 아니지만... 듀오도 유명합니다.<//Review><userid>104857793324055294710<//userid>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) I'm not much into boba tea, but it actually tasted excellent here. They have many varieties and so you can buy some food here if you want ....

She’s professional, sweet and a joy to talk with.
I love how my hair turned out! 😊 And the salon is very cute and lovely!
(Hopefully I’m able to make it back and book my hair appts with her again in the future)
Thank you much Danielle! ❤️< /text>< Pics>

Very nice and friendly service! Mark is the best and I absolutely love his skill on shaping hair and creating just what you envision. Parking is a bit scarce (metered or paid parking)  so give yourself some time for that. Great location and right in the heart of Little Italy. So happy I found 'Mark on Madison'!! 😊</Text>

Excellent experience, Danielle Taormina is a very talented hairstylist. I was a walk in client here in vacation who is a stylist of 21 plus years and a brand educator who just needed a good pick me up.  My haircut is fantastic and the next time I'm in the area I definately will be scheduling an appointment..<//Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>So sorry about the first 2-star review!  It was operator error.  Couldn't fix it right away and then forgot to try again later.  At any rate, Alex was welcoming, the salon was clean and updated, and comfortable.  Love that you've got complementary wine!  Not gonna lie, I'm still getting used to my new hair cut.  I have very curly hair that I've been growing out for about a year, and wanted my new cut to look great both curly and straight.  Initial cut was a bit of a shock, length wise the reality is shorter than I expected, but it's not fair to make a complete judgement about the cut until I sit with it for a little while.  I left the salon with bone straight hair so still need to check it out curly before knowing how I really feel about it.  Looking forward to playing around with it some to see how I really feel.  Hoping it will be fabulous!<//review>< Pics>

<text>Gina, the owner of Gloss, was awesome.  She listened to my request to follow a photograph of a hairstyle as close as possible, and she did a great job.  I would definitely recommend her if you are looking for a talented, friendly, and experienced stylist.  The location itself was very cute, situated in an old house on Fir street near some other cute shops. She told me that they welcome dogs during their services, so if you have a pooch, feel free to bring them by.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I have been going to Gina at Gloss the Salon for almost 15 years! I searched endlessly for someone who was able to control my wild hair. It is not curly, not wavy, just a bit frizzy and lot of it. She always makes it look great! People have stopped me in public and have asked where I get my hair cut. I have her cards handy and tell them I will ONLY go to Gina-She is the BEST!! :-)<//text>

I was bored and frustrated with my hair, then I was recommended by a friend to try Gina Collins at Gloss the Salon. That was almost 2 years ago. Gina is kind, talented and able to cut and style my hair in easy creative ways. The salon is relaxed, clean and comfortable with a bit of a hip vibe💕< /Review>

The best hair cut you will ever receive. I promise. It's the cleanest most precision cut. You know because you're able to style it the following week when you have to blow dry it yourself. Lol.

I rate this salon a one out of five because of the experience that I never was able to receive. I was on my way driving to the salon and got a text telling me that my appointment was canceled with no alternate time or date. I think this is very unprofessional. I texted back and even called twice and have gotten no response. I do not recommend this salon simply for poor customer service.<//Review>

She’s professional, sweet and a joy to talk with.
I love how my hair turned out! 😊 And the salon is very cute and lovely!
(Hopefully I’m able to make it back and book my hair appts with her again in the future)
Thank you much Danielle! ❤️</Text></record>

Very nice and friendly service! Mark is the best and I absolutely love his skill on shaping hair and creating just what you envision. Parking is a bit scarce (metered or paid parking)  so give yourself some time for that. Great location and right in the heart of Little Italy. So happy I found 'Mark on Madison'!! 😊</review>

Excellent experience, Danielle Taormina is a very talented hairstylist. I was a walk in client here in vacation who is a stylist of 21 plus years and a brand educator who just needed a good pick me up.  My haircut is fantastic and the next time I'm in the area I definately will be scheduling an appointment..</Text>

<Text>So sorry about the first 2-star review!  It was operator error.  Couldn't fix it right away and then forgot to try again later.  At any rate, Alex was welcoming, the salon was clean and updated, and comfortable.  Love that you've got complementary wine!  Not gonna lie, I'm still getting used to my new hair cut.  I have very curly hair that I've been growing out for about a year, and wanted my new cut to look great both curly and straight.  Initial cut was a bit of a shock, length wise the reality is shorter than I expected, but it's not fair to make a complete judgement about the cut until I sit with it for a little while.  I left the salon with bone straight hair so still need to check it out curly before knowing how I really feel about it.  Looking forward to playing around with it some to see how I really feel.  Hoping it will be fabulous!< /Text><Rating>4<//Rating></record>

<text>Gina, the owner of Gloss, was awesome.  She listened to my request to follow a photograph of a hairstyle as close as possible, and she did a great job.  I would definitely recommend her if you are looking for a talented, friendly, and experienced stylist.  The location itself was very cute, situated in an old house on Fir street near some other cute shops. She told me that they welcome dogs during their services, so if you have a pooch, feel free to bring them by.< /text>< Pics>

I have been going to Gina at Gloss the Salon for almost 15 years! I searched endlessly for someone who was able to control my wild hair. It is not curly, not wavy, just a bit frizzy and lot of it. She always makes it look great! People have stopped me in public and have asked where I get my hair cut. I have her cards handy and tell them I will ONLY go to Gina-She is the BEST!! :-)<//Text>

I was bored and frustrated with my hair, then I was recommended by a friend to try Gina Collins at Gloss the Salon. That was almost 2 years ago. Gina is kind, talented and able to cut and style my hair in easy creative ways. The salon is relaxed, clean and comfortable with a bit of a hip vibe💕<//review>

I am a business professional and always want to look my best. I have been a client of Gina at Gloss the Salon since moving to San Diego. She looks at my hair as an artistic endeavor, she never rushes through. I appreciate that she will make time in her schedule when I call at the last minute for an appointment.</review>

<Review>Love it!  I went to Gina.  She knew just what to do without my needing to direct.  I love what she did which is called balayage color.  It looks natural and fresh and lighter.  The gray looks like blond.  I'm about to call for another appointment right now.   Highly recommend!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I showed up 15 min early for my hair appointment and she was just getting another women into the chair for "a quick trim" 45+ later and I was still waiting. Highly  unprofessional and careless with your time. I don't recommend them to anyone that likes customer service and    Punctuality.< /review>

I rate this salon a one out of five because of the experience that I never was able to receive. I was on my way driving to the salon and got a text telling me that my appointment was canceled with no alternate time or date. I think this is very unprofessional. I texted back and even called twice and have gotten no response. I do not recommend this salon simply for poor customer service.<//Text>

Placed order online for pickup. Was greeted as soon as I walked in by employees and they had my order ready in the time the website said they would. Pizza was delicious and hot, and the size(personal) was a little bigger then usual which was nice. I took off a star because I wasn't offered cheese/peppers/napkins, this is the second time at this location. Come on man your a Pizza spot offer that cheese please lol< /text>

<Review>Eddie who took my order was very helpful and nice. Now to the food. Ordered extra sauce because pizza is always so dry. Was like eating cardboard. On the all meat I could count the pieces of meat on each slice. Why not cover it? $70 dollars later and I wish I bought Digorno. Wish there was a good pizza around. I miss the good ole days where these places took pride.< /Review>< Rate>

<Text>This place was horrible. Placed our order and we were 15 minutes late to pick it up amd they threw it out and was so rude. They had such a bad attitude and didn't even apologize and I heard them laugh as I was walking out. If I could give 0 stars i would.

Updated Review: Must be under new management because this place has gone down hill. Wrong orders, burnt pizza and flies everywhere. Had to get a refund after 2 times my pizza was made incorrectly. They falsely advertise there menu. See Photos of advertisement and actual burnt product.
**** SKIP THIS LOCATION and go to old Sacramento. (They honor veterans with a 50% discount) Their pizza is as advertised and they are clean... No flies.<//Text>

<Review>Went for the lunch buffet with 2 kids. They really liked being able to choose from 4 different kinds of pizza. Good value for the $. All you can eat pizza, salad bar, bread sticks, cinnamon bread sticks. The staff here is very nice. This is an older, but kept up pizza place.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
This round table was horrible not only did they not say my name loud enough for me to hear in an empty restaurant but when I got my pizza I was in such a hurry after waiting for so long that I ran out the door with it not to miss my playoff football game when I opened up the pizza it wasn't cooked. I called there and the person that answered the phone was very rude and not helpful. I won't be going back to this Round Table Pizza and I recommend that you do not go also<//Review>

<Review>Not much of a selection for the buffet, what was there was there for a while. When a new pizza came out it hardly had any toppings, I guess they can't afford it, even though they charge alot for the buffet. Think twice about visiting this one.</Review>< Pictures>

The Rountable Pizza on 51st and Folsom Blvd is always bombs. King Arthur supreme still their best pizza than the pepperoni. Always get them well done thats how i like it and they even got fresh squeezed IPA.<//Review>

<review>Pretty expensive for the size but well worth it for the experience. I've played sports all my life and its by far the best place to go eat after a game win. Love the sports friendly atmosphere.

$30 for a large franchise pizza is not acceptable to me! Search for coupons if you want to save a few bucks at this location. King Arthur Supreme is my favorite, but there's was skimpy on toppings.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><pics>None</pics><text>This isn't a review for one visit, but an overall experience with this location.  Our family has been a Round Table Pizza customer for the past 20+ years.  We've been going to this location for almost five years now.  We usually rotate between three or four different pizzas since we have multiple favorites.  The wings are great**, and much bigger than a wingstop Chicken wing.  My wife loves the Garlic Twists.  They are pizza dough, garlic, cheese, and a ranch(?) type sauce cooked to order.  The pizza is a bit more expensive than a Domino's/Papa John's/Little Caesar's, but the quality is MUCH better.  If you usually get cheap pizza, do yourself a favor and try Round Table.

Edit:  They changed the size of their pizzas.  The large used to be 16 slices, but is now 12.  The extra large is 16 slices but used to be 20.  There doesn't seem to be a 20 slice pizza anymore.  They also changed the wings when I wasn't paying attention.  I do not recommend the boneless wings.  Haven't tried the Classic wings since they made the change.  My rating has gone from five stars to four.  It used to be expensive but worth it.  The ingredients are still incredible, but the bang for your buck has diminished substantially.< /text>< user>

It's a round table so the pizza is pretty good. That however it's the only good thing about this place they have screwed up 4 of 5 orders. I tried three way called online and going in the store. Last time I went in the store cause that was the only order they got right. I said give me the special bla bla bla. They said you need a coupon. I said you do not need a coupon to order online but I don't trust ordering it online. They say you need a coupon. Done walked out I will never go there again. Mountain Mike's is a much better option.< /Text>

My family are regular patrons, but we will never go there again.  The bathrooms were filthy, the drink dispensers were syrupy and sticky. Behind the cook station was also dirty.  It made our family cringe to see what has occurred at this location.  Unfortunately, we will have to patronize elsewhere.< /text>

On 5 different occasions, the pizza has simply been messed up. Twice the pizza wasn't cooked thoroughly enough and the dough was still raw, twice the specialty pizza we ordered was missing ingredients entirely from the pizza. The latest episode was when we ordered a vegetarian pizza for my aunt who was allergic to most types of red meat, and they put sausage on the pizza when I spent a full minute explaining the food allergy. I'd recommend Pizza guy's on 36th Jst if you want a decent pizza with great service, these guys just want to kill your relatives.<//text>

<review>Disclaimer...it’s a bit pricey. That being said, it’s well worth it! The employees were so kind, welcoming and helpful! Everyone had a great attitude and energy and the location had an open, relaxing design and is very spacious.

My friend and I tried this place on our way down from Santa Rosa and we did not expect it to be so wonderful!

I definitely think this should be for a nice breakfast or lunch but I feel so bad that we ate quickly and hopped back on the road.

Definitely try it out if you want a bougie, delicious meal made with love.< /review><user_name>Di Anne Padovano< /user_name>< Pics>

<Review>I have always enjoyed the chicken wrap and the pesto pasta. A few hiccups along the way not sure if it was new staff but I got cilantro on the wrap once. It was taken care of immediately with a new wrap. Tonight I noticed green onions in the pesto pasta, I  don't really care for green onions even though they are in the wrap. So is this new, if so I might have to think about ordering this. I had even thought of asking for the recipe since I liked it so much. Thanks<//Review>< pics>

Great place to come in, sit down, and use the WiFi while enjoying the best fries in Redding. Seriously, I don't think there's anywhere in Redding that has better fries. If you like crispy, satisfying, quality fries, this is the place flr you.<//text>

I’m revisiting this review because I think my 3 star wasn’t fair. Nobody can be perfect all the time and I had one disappointing experience. They have consistently good quality and service.  Early in the pandemic when they started taking delivery orders for staples like bread, cheese, meats, etc.one of the owners was out doing deliveries himself. I’ve ordered from one of their other establishments and also had food delivered by an owner... not every owner cares that much, but they do. That’s what you can expect from them, and that’s what they’ve shown over and over. A commitment to doing a great job and that is what they should be reviewed for.

Here’s my original review which is technically accurate but not representative of their high standards.

The food is good but the menu is limited and don’t try to order off-menu. For example, our family’s Valentines Day tradition since having kids is going to FTH and getting French Toast. They no longer have regular French Toast on the menu. I asked if they could make it and was told that only make the “Mascarpone-Stuffed Croissant French Toast” now. They have bread, they have eggs, they have all of the other ingredients but won’t do it. Even McDonalds does off-menu orders.</Text>

<Text>The food is great. We had the California chicken sandwich with fries and a cobb salad. Both were delicious, well balanced, and flavorful. We also got the blueberry crumble pie which was delicious! We went back the next morning to grab coffee before hitting the road and it was very good. The staff is friendly, the service is fast, and the covid-19 protocol is great. Highly recommend if you're in the area.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< user_id>

House made chips are great.  The Cobb salad is outstanding, lots of bacon avocado, egg, huge chunks of chicken. The food is not the cheapest, but you get plenty and the quality is the best. Best pies in town too, the peach was super fresh  The new outdoor seating is perfect, it was over 100 degrees and it was still comfortable out there. This is one of the best places to eat in Redding. The convience store next door has a great selection of local beers too.< /Review></record>

It's a little pricey, but the food is pretty good. I think their salads lack imagination and flavor, but I love their sandwiches. They also have really good pastries, which are homemade.<//text>

<Review>I have eaten here for years, ever since it opened,  and it has always been fantastic.
So tonight I decided to try the takeout at 5. I have only been eating at home during lockdown. I ordered a well done café burger with Swiss cheese and no onion, and a side of fries. The burger was filling, so I just ate a few fries.
Then, about 15 minutes later, it all started coming back up.
This has Never been my experience there before. I wanted to let them know that something needs to be checked out! Old fry oil?The lettuce or tomato? I don’t know. But I have never had this from eating there before. And my stomach still is burning and upset 5 hours later, so I don’t know when or if I’ll go back.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Love this place. Good people good atmosphere. A bit too much bssm pretty bois but if you don’t mind them then you’re chilling like a home slice on a Friday night on a beach with fresh lobster that you grilled that your cousin caught that you cooked with butter because you’re hungry because you worked so long today because you need money because your broke.<//review>< Pictures>

Although a tad pricey on the food, the quality is excellent, and the taste is superb. It is part food, part coffee shop. So there is plenty of room for people to study (although its encouraged during meal hours (lunch and dinner) that you do not stay to do homework/reading). The coffee is also very good. Their drip coffee is excellent as well, and if you stay in, you can get an 'in-house coffee' that allows for 2 free refills. Great stuff, and healthy!<//Review>

Good food!  Price range is a tad little bit up around $10~ or more for hot sandwiches, but honestly not bad because the quality is great.  Coffee is great.

Waiting time isn't outrageous, just know if you're asking for some food know it's not necessarily fast food.  But it's faster than restaurants.</Text>

Good food, often pretty slow if you dont call in or order online first. But if you do, it is there when they say it will be.
You can make the Chi Bowl easily vegan so a good choice.< /Review>

Tri-tip Philly cheese steak sandwich melts in your mouth. This is a popular place the lines get long. But the staff is efficient.</Text>

We came to visit Bethel Church for the weekend and saw this place on the corner. Stopped in for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised. Super friendly staff, great food and a nice ambience. Kind of like a Panera Bread take-off. Highly recommended.< /review>

Food is very good. Great sausage breakfast burritos. Service can be a bit slow at times because of crowds of people that frequent it. Staff is all top notch and friendly, usually after 2-3 times coming in they will recognize you on a first name basis.</text>

I love this place! Their soup is amazing, and I can get a hearty breakfast a steamy cup of coffee and the most delicious bread I have ever had for a reasonable price. Their sourdough is made the right way and even though I have a mild gluten allergy I can have From the Heath bread with no I'll effects.  The folks are so flip pin friendly that work there, you might think we were old friends. Massive thumbs up!<//Review>

Love the food here! However it would be awesome if you had a line for call in orders, it defeats the whole purpose to call it in only to have to wait in a huge line to pick it up. I only have a half hour lunch and I never get to eat my sandwich on my actual lunch because I run out of time :(<//review>

<Review>The fries are great, but the pulled pork sandwich that I ordered was not good. The pork was burnt and there was far more slaw on it than pork. It didn't seem like a busy night, but the 2 orders ahead of mine were wrong and it took forever to get food.<//Review>< Pictures>

If you have to stop at a chain restaurant, this is the one to stop at.  Great food that's prepared when you order it and a staff that always seems happy to see you.  A must stop when traveling the I5 corridor.<//text>

The counter is not organised well; the front gets crowded and you get to the register before you see the pastry case. Otherwise service is great, coffee is delish. And food is very tasty. Prices are fair but I consider it a luxury rather than an everyday lunch or breakfast spot.<//review>

If you are in Redding for any amount of time you will find that the prices of food everywhere are high, excluding fast food chains. The hearth is an excellent option for breakfast, lunch, and even dinner. During the rush hours, you may not find a seat, because for Redding, this is one of the best options you have.</text>

<review>The best mechanics around. My husband I don't take our cars to just any place. Very picky when it comes to who work under the hood of our cars. And Jamie is just the greatest,  very kind and always has a smile when he greets you. Prices are reasonable also. Wouldn't go anywhere else. I highly recommend this shop.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Jaime and his staff are very professional, welcoming, knowledgable and reasonably priced!! I was referred by my mom, who was referred by a family friend years ago. I don't think I'll ever go to another mechanic as long as his shop is around. 😀< /Text>

I started going here because they kept beating out price quote from previous places I went to. I kept going back because they always did an exceptional job and were affordable.  He will not take on work that they don't specialize in. He always refers me to other businesses that specialize in what I need and I haven't been disappointed yet.</text>

<text>Was low on funds and needed a emergency brake pad change. These guys were the only ones willing to help me out with a reasonable price and still did a outstanding job. Guys are knowledgeable and go out the way to figure out the problem. As long as I live in the area and have a issue with my car, these guys are where I'm going for sure.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I’ve taken my car here  for everything and they’ve charged me reasonably and have done solid work. I’m sad I’m moving to OC next month. But if anything happens, I’m coming back to them!< /Text>

Went in to get a brake fluid flush, after having it all done, I went home to inspect and saw they over tighten my Brake Fluid Reservoir Cap and cracked it across the entire top, which was not like that before hand, they even inspect before working on the car to confirm nothing is wrong before hand. After speaking with them about the issue and having them inspect the cap afterwards, they agreed to replace my cap and said it would be in in about 3 days and they will give me a call. 3 days pass, no call, and I show up to check in and they say it hasn't come in, another 3 days and still nothing. Keep in mind they said they had the part in the next city over. Now at this point my brake fluid is all black & contaminated waiting for them to replace the part they broke, with now a WORSE brake system then when I went in. Still no response, no refund, no new cap, and now I have a dangerous car I am forced to drive daily which is in worse condition than I brought it in for. I am still waiting for them to fix this and compensate. Call me.<//review>

Craving subway today and didn't want to wait in line so my girlfriend and I decided to place a moible order and waited. I went inside to grab my food and drove all the way home just to go see that my sandwich was totally wrong. I asked for toasted bread for both sandwiches and then I open my spicy Italian to see a long black piece of HAIR in my food. I also noticed that when I went to go pick up my food she want wearing a hair net. 😡Just very disappointed</Review>

The new female employee is lazy and doesn't know anything. I said I was there fir a pick up and she stared blankly at me. Another employee had to look for my meal. Then I asked her if they had Doritos since the shelf was pretty bare. She lied and said whatever we have out there is it. Then my friend asked another worker if they had any hot Cheetos. They told the new girl to get some hot Cheetos. Then the new girl asked if, I wanted the Doritos still. I gave her a look and said if course I did.</text>

I ordered a patty flatbread sandwich online I quickly went and picked up the sandwich which had no meat in it only veggies and they refused to do anything about it except telling me I could pick up the sandwich another day like are you serious I'm late for work and that is my lunch for the day not only was the cashier rude and and kept telling me to repeat my name when I am hard of hearing but he made a joke out of my order I have been coming to this subway for 4 years and I will never return here.<//review>

Just an average Subway.  Some days good service and good food.  Some days bad service and bad food.  Like a coin toss really.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>Went to Banner mattress to buy a box spring for my new bed. Val was absolutely amazing. He not only took the time to explain the options available, but he really helped me to gain an understanding of what was the best option for me. The whole process was very customer oriented and everything from choosing the box spring to having it delivered went smoothly. It's awesome to walk into a place and immediately feel like you can trust the people selling the product, Val was absolutely that guy. I love my new box spring and the quality is great. I will absolutely return to Val when I am ready to buy a new mattress!!!</review>< resp>

We've always been so overwhelmed with TOO MUCH information when shopping for a mattress, yet Octavio made it simple and easy to understand.  So much so, that we felt confident that we have made the best decision.  SO glad we went to Banner Mattress - our experience was great:  Super fast delivery, excellent customer service and extremely efficient communication.  I HIGHLY recommend Banner Mattress....you will feel very  taken care of.<//Review>

I had a wonderful experience at Banner Mattress in La Quinta this past Sunday thanks to Val.  My boyfriend and I were greeted by Val as soon as we walked in the door.  He introduced himself and suggested that we browse the showroom.  After a few minutes of browsing, Val came to help us by asking several questions about type of mattress, firmness, back pain, etc. in order to better help find the correct mattress.  He was knowledgeable, patient, informative and budget-conscious throughout the whole buying process.  I would recommend this location to my family and friends.  Thanks Val!< /Text>

I came in here after going to a few different mattress places and off the bat I knew he was going to help me make the right decision. I had Val Pensader help me out and he was fantastic. He made the experience quick, efficient, and fun. Usually mattress shopping has been a drag, but he was so lively and energetic (like he actually enjoyed his job which is a nice change!) and I came out satisfied. I'd rate it 10/10 if I could. Will definitely be back, hopefully not soon, but if I ever need a mattress I know where I'm coming and who to ask for, Val.</Review>

<Text>This was one of the best buying experiences I've ever had as a consumer. When my girlfriend and I first walked in we were greeted by Val, he was very friendly and knowledgeable. He started by showing us a few different mattresses and gauged our style/preference, then pointed us in the right direction. He was also extremely patient with us as we tried almost every bed in the store! He definitely made the whole experience an enjoyable one (considering we had a rambunctious 5 year old and a newborn in tow) and we got an exceptional deal on the bed we finally chose! I would highly recommend this store if you need to buy a new bed, they are the best!</Text>< Response>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>So we walked in to the store with our minds made up on what mattress we were getting. I could say Val came to our rescue otherwise we had it all wrong. He was very pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable. Not only did we end up with the right mattress – totally different from what we were to get – but also with a wealth of knowledge on how to choose the right mattress to meet your needs. The service was excellent and Val was very patient, understanding and informative. Thank you Banner mattress. Thanks you Val.<//Text>< pics>

<text>I purchased a mattress from Octavio at the La Quinta, CA store. He listened to what I wanted, walked me to what I had described , explained the quality of the mattress, asked me to try it, said it was on sale. I didn't go to any other mattress stores. Bought it, he helped me load it. Couldn't have been easier or more pleasant.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80daf91b975a3e5d:0x3f308829c8ce3a2a< /gmapID></record>

Octavio was beyond helpful and really provided a positive experience for both my mom and I. He went out of his way to find the best fit for me and was a great help all around!! Would recommend to anyone to go here, because the customer service and product knowledge that they have really made all the difference! I really appreciated Octavio's integrity, and I'm beyond exited for my mattress to get here! Thank you so much!</Review>

I purchased a mattress at Banner Mattress in La Quinta. Ocatavio was such a very knowledgeable salesman! I was quite impressed! He directed me to the perfect mattress. It was delivered the very next day! My first night, I slept so soundly on my new mattress! Thank you Banner Mattress! Thank you Octavio!< /Text>

<text>Val walked us through the ins and outs of getting a nicer mattress. He was very knowledgeable and asked several questions to make sure we chose the best mattress for us! My husband has a bad back and shoulder and Val made sure to tell us what mattresses would help with his discomfort.

We are glad that we chose to work with Val at this Banner Mattress! We will recommend to everyone!<//text>< Pictures>

Banner was recommended by our realtor. What a great find. Stephen helped us to find the best mattress for my husband and I as well as for 3 guest rooms.  We are totally satisfied with the purchase especially after shopping at a few other local stores where the salespeople were very pushy. Stephen knows his stuff. And the delivery guys were just the best. We will definitely refer our friends moving from Canada. Thanks Stephen, Juan and helper (the delivery guys) you made this the smoothest part of our move!</Text>

Excellent visit and purchase experience. Val is very knowledgeable and helped in our decision to purchase two memory foam mattresses for the kids. No pressure -all smiles atmosphere, this is the place to buy with confidence and peace. This is our second purchase in five years, we won't go anywhere else. Thank you, Val !!!</text>

<review>My father recently had back surgery, so I spent the day with him looking for the perfect new bed that best suited his needs. We went to Banner Mattress and Val Pensader went above and beyond. He listened to what it was that we were looking for in a mattress, he was very informative and felt more like a friend than a pushy salesman (and let me tell you we had experienced some salesmen from hell that day!!) I really appreciate the time he took to help us choose the right bed. I will never go or recommend anywhere or anyone else!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>We arrived at Banner Mattress and was unsure what we were looking for. We were approached by your sales associate Val Pensader.  We told him what we were looking for and our price range. We tried a couple beds and found the one we were looking for and within our price range. WE LOVE our bed. Val made our shopping experience easy. He is an asset to Banner Mattress.<//Text>< Rating>

I was completely without a clue about what I wanted when I came to Banner mattress. It was a recon mission. Val came to my rescue and knew right away what was ideal for me just by hearing about my back pain and sleeping habits. He really knows what's best, and never made me feel pressured. I appreciate that so much. I can't wait to get my mattress! Thanks, Val!</Review>

We bought a bed & we are so excited! Val made the whole experience so pleasant and enjoyable. From finding out exactly what our issues are, so that he could suggest the best mattress for us to making it easy and with no pressure. I really appreciate his style. He let us decide and if it wasn't going to work for us, then he didn't try to pressure us into it. I would definetly recommend him to our friends and if we ever need to buy another mattress, we would definetly go back to him. Thank you Val!</text>

After reading the negative reviews below, I was somewhat reluctant to visit this store. However my experience today was absolutely the opposite.  I wanted to learn more of the Banner brand --  as the mattresses are locally made(so they say) --  and wanted to compare other brands on a new queen.  The showroom is very large, with a great selection. The sales personnel were extremely friendly, helpful, patient, and willing to be sure we picked what was best for us.  They offered even a better deal than the "sale" prices, and truthfully couldn't have been more professional.  They had floor model offers as well and made every accommodation to meet our needs.

My guess is a postive shopping experience is not as motivating as a negative to write review.   I hope this helps balance things out a bit.< /Text>

<review>The mattress I purchased, a sealy posterpedic, is indenting deeply on both sides of the bed (after a year). After calling at least 5 times and leaving messages for Jorge, who apparently takes care of warrenty claims, I received paperwork in the mail. Included in this paperwork is the request for me to pay a $50 fee for banner matress to file a claim for me. I have already paid almost 2 grand for this bed that I can't even sleep in and now i have to pay an extra $50 for someone to think about replacing this horrible mattress? I'm writing this review in hopes that I can get the attention of this company about how ridiculous this process is and get some real responses.<//review><rating>1<//rating><userid>106600483090814800924</userid>< user_name>

After looking around at other mattress stores, yes there were sales, re-bates and promotions, but coming to Banner Mattress in La Quinta, CA. and receiving the "BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE" by a gentleman  named Val Pensader is what made us purchase our Mattress. He took the time to explain in detail what fit our need. VERY PROFESSIONAL!! THANK YOU VAL!!<//review>

After reading the negative reviews below, I was somewhat reluctant to visit this store. However my experience today was absolutely the opposite.  I wanted to learn more of the Banner brand --  as the mattresses are locally made(so they say) --  and wanted to compare other brands on a new queen.  The showroom is very large, with a great selection. The sales personnel were extremely friendly, helpful, patient, and willing to be sure we picked what was best for us.  They offered even a better deal than the "sale" prices, and truthfully couldn't have been more professional.  They had floor model offers as well and made every accommodation to meet our needs.

My guess is a postive shopping experience is not as motivating as a negative to write review.   I hope this helps balance things out a bit.< /Review>

Val Pensader did a fantastic job helping us find the perfect mattress. He took his time to show us several mattresses, was not pushy at all, had alot of helpful knowledge of each mattress. This is the 5th store we've been to in the past 2 weeks. Due to a car accident and the several bone fractures I've had, the bed we found is heaven! Here's to getting better rest!< /Review>

< Review>
First I want to start by saying, I hate salesmen! But my experience at this location wasn't the typical experience. I was greeted with a genuine greeting not just a bark or what do you need type of greeting. The salesman spoke to me as if I was a friend stopping by so my guard didn't go up right away which is very unusual in all my retail experiences. Val spoke to me at my level not from the " I know more so I will make you guess what I'm saying " mountain which put me at ease and made me feel like I was not getting sold anything. I have to say that after the experience I had with this young man I want everyone to go to this guy because thats how you let a customer buy and not be sold.. Great Job banner mattress on the hire...<//Review>

This experience of searching for the correct mattress was something I hadn't gone through in more than eight years. Val Pensader had all the patience for my son, my mom and myself. He took the time to show us a couple different  styles and models, pointed out the specific interest and purpose for each material and firmness and we where amazed by one specific model. The 12" Visco Mattress with the cooling layer. My mom and i where so amazed we bought two sets.  It's been over a month sleeping on this mattress and we can't get over the feeling of enjoying a good night's sleep. Feeling rested as soon as you wake up in the morning and no more  body aches or trouble sleeping at night because of the tossing and turning. We love our new mattress!! Thank you Val Pensader for all your help it is greatly appreciated.< /text>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>I recieved the worst customer service today when shopping at your La Quinta, CA location. I was working with the manager by the name of Steve Lifshey. He was extremely rude to our family. He started by rudely snapping at my husband, and then snapped at my mother and I. When me and my husband would try to speak, he snapped at us and told us that he was not talking to us, that he was speaking to my mother because she was the one buying a mattress. Needless to say, we did not purchase from your company after being treated like this. We also had our grandparents with us who were looking to purchase for their bedroom and spare bedroom. He lost those sales for the store too. When we were leaving your store, I asked him to speak to his manager, he responded that HE is the manager. I then asked for the owners information and he told me to "go look it up in the phonebook!" I can not recommend shopping at a store with management like that.< /Text><Name>Ashley Williams</Name>< Rating>

< review>
I am a real person who has lived in the Coachella Valley for 28 years . I own a business which requires me to be on my feet most of the day. I have been living with chronic pain in my lower back for the last 12 years and by the end of my workday, it is difficult to bend down, reach out in front of me, get out of my car, or lift anything without pain.

I spent the last 6 months reviewing mattresses and to be honest, I was completely confused! There's NO WAY you can buy a mattress without laying on it to get the feel for the firmness or comfort you personally like.
I went to Banner Mattress in La Quinta with full intentions of shopping other mattress stores that evening.

I was greeted by a gentleman named "Octavio" who assisted me the entire time . He was not pushy but was extremely informative. He explained the springs in each mattress I tested, the fabrics, the coolness level, and all information relating to each level of comfort, firmness and support from each companies mattress.

I ended up buying the first mattress I tested but not until I had laid on every mattress in the store!  I purchased the Scorziell  Amalfi brand pillow top which I found out is Banner Mattresses signature brand.    I am telling the truth that I have spoken to Octavio twice now since I purchased the bed.... I have had  NO BACK PAIN  SINCE THE BED WAS DELIVERED!!!!
My husband has not put an ice pack on his back since our new mattress arrived !!!!!

Octavio was professional, courteous, knowledgeable and "tuned in" to my needs.
Thank you so much for guiding me and helping me relieve years of back pain! We are very happy with Banner Mattress and Octavio, a true professional!

AMAZING!
That's all I have to say about this dealership and the wonderful people that work there, specially Arlene, Julio from finance, Victor and Tony.
Just bought a Mazda yesterday and I couldn't be happier with their excellent service and friendly helpfulness. The team was incredible and helped me get EXACTLY what I wanted. Thank you so much!
I highly recommend this dealership.< /Text>

<Review>Best car leasing experience. Emailed the dealership about a vehicle I was interested in leasing. Tony sent me extremely fair and reasonable numbers for the lease. Came in and waited a bit but very nice showrooms. Arleene was a very helpful point of contact for all of the details of the lease. Absolutely no pressure to buy or throw me absurd numbers that didn't match up with what was told to me. The numbers sold themselves. Finance guy, Julio was also great! And Siya was amazing in showing me all the features of my car. Like I said, the bear car buying/leasing experience I've had. They are basically giving cars away at the fair and reasonable prices!</Review><resp>{'time': 1612893861187, 'text': "Hello Eric,\nThanks so much for your wonderful review and the five-star rating!

I was looking for a Mazda 3 hatchback with manual transmission. Every dealership near me kept giving me a markup price or unwanted services and accessories on top of MSRP. Found the car I was looking for at Culver City. I asked them over the phone what the price would be and they gave me the deal that I wanted. When i showed up, I thought they might sneak in some hidden fees or charges but to my surprise they were HONEST and RESPECTFUL to the deal that we had made over the phone. They didn't even try to persuade me into extended warranties or unwanted accessories. Excellent customer service. Will be doing business with these people again. Shoutout to Michael.</Review>

<Name>R J Enoel</Name><Date>1623489994450<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><Review>An overall amazing dealership experience that has an unconventional approach to doing business. No herd of sales persons gang tackling you as soon as you open the door. A very classy, relaxed but extremely efficient well organized company. Personally the most impressive I've experienced in over 40 years of automobile purchases and leases. Worth your time to make the drive from any distance. They are committed to customer service and your satisfaction from the Receptionist Ceret who directed me to Kylon. who immediately got the ball rolling with Arlene and Tony in sales. The sales transaction moved forward flawlessly. Everything in order and prepared prior to my arrival. Paperwork, the car,etc. The time in finance was a blur. In and out in minutes compliments of Roman. The walk around was clearly explained and understood thanks to Kervin. No lag between all the steps and no regrets. Thank you to all involved in making my experience a positive and memorable one. Bob L.<//Review>< Pictures>

<name>Jonathan L<//name><review>They negligently sold me a new tire with a leaky stem valve but don't feel the hassle to fix it warrants a discount, and the coolant sensor no longer works after they replaced the coolant, and they don't respond to text messages for days or even weeks, they will not look up on my account and tell me what brand of struts they put in because now my car bottoms out.

1st day, see tire was low BEFORE leaving lot, reinflated
Two days later, new tire is flat again!
2nd time driving there, they had to keep it overnight!
3rd day driving there, they fix, but refuse giving discount or replacement tire.
They fixed valve for free and gave loaner car, however, I feel a discount is fair for my lost time at work driving there & back over and over due to their mistake. They disagree, and feel fixing the valve & giving a loaner&uber is sufficient. Keep in mind this new leaky tire was part of $6,000 worth of suspension fixes, so I feel they have the profit margins from my account to discount the tire due to hassle & my time off work. Sorry but even though they were nice, I cannot rate the experience well since they do not value my time lost due to their mistake. Its very uncomfortable telling my boss & team I'm taking a large chunk of workday off to keep driving in to a mechanic over and over all week long. Not to mention, my wife was about to drive on a flat tire they sold me, very risky for my wife, child, & myself.

Then when texting with them I needed to reschedule the appt for coolant sensor breaking after they replaced coolant, they ghosted me. Screenshot attached< /review></record>

Eric Reyes, my salesperson extraordinaire, was excellent. The space is excellent. The cars are the best bang for the buck, as they're rightfully known for. The Miata is a four-cylinder masterpiece that anyone wanting a Cayman or other German roadster should consider if they also like paying off their mortgage, and are willing to give up brand name cred to keep half their money. Would recommend this location and salesman to any friend or family member searching for any vehicle. Looking forward to making this my go-to dealership.</review>

<review>As reviews state, and as many car dealerships are, they will love you and treat you like their best friend until the sale is complete. After that, it’s like texting a girl who was interested in you when she was drunk but now realizes her mistake.

Dealerships seem to have a superiority complex, like they’re too good to be selling you a car. You guys make less than 150k a year and don’t even treat the customers like you truly care. I’ve had people at BMW treat me with more actual interpersonal care.< /review>< Pics>

With this being my first leasing experience I don't have anything to compare it to but I have and still work in industries where customer service is key. Culver City Mazda and their team are on top of it all! From my initial search on the website, to meeting with the onsite team and eventually driving off the lot, it was virtually a seamless transaction.

Thank you Ceret for your warm welcome and checking to ensure I was being assisted while waiting! Arlene, the reviews don't lie you're amazing! Flo, I appreciate you taking the time to clearly review the terms of my lease with and making sure I understood what I was signing up for! Victor, you are definitely an expert and know how to simply walk-through the features of vehicle before sending the customer off with their new shiny toy!

My only feedback has to do with the appointment scheduling and letting future prospective buyers/lessees know who they may be meeting ahead of time. When I arrived a few minutes before my appointment, it seemed as if it were still being set up on the spot. Not a huge ordeal to me but I can see where some other people may be frustrated.</Text>

<Text>A little bit of a hit and miss with this dealership over the last 4 years. I've been here mostly for service and twice for possible car purchase. My very first experience was mediocre. It started bad then it was good then REALLY bad. They stated parts needed replacing soon but were brand new factory parts replaced at an independent shop that had been done 3 months earlier. Second experience was pretty good - service again. Standard oil change, got a ride home - nice!! First possible car purchase: couldn't find a car in color /options - not their fault but salesman was very nice, professional. Second possible car purchase wasn't pleasant. Looking for a certified used vehicle but salesman didn't seem interested enough.< /Text>< pics>

Aaron Corea was super efficient in helping me get set up with all the paperwork online so that by the time I got to the Mazda dealership, all I had to do was sign the papers. It took less than an hour to get my new car.

I have been to this location twice within. The past 2 or so years and received the same advisor that is completely unhelpful.

The first situation Mazda was suppose to fix an issue that a recall was sent out for. After trying to stop by without an appointment when the issue was occurring no one would help me. I was told I had to make an appointment and there were no opening for 2 weeks. Once my appointment date came and I dropped off my car around 8:00am-9:00am they had my car until 5:00pm when they close. There were no follow up calls, when I called to numerous times to follow up the "Advisor" was NEVER available to speak. After just showing up around 5:00pm. I was then told that my car was not worked on at all.

The second situation I took my car for an oil change (with an appointment time for 1:20pm) and decided while I was there to get a diagnostic as well I was told by the "SAME ADVISOR" the diagnostic would be $107.00 even though I could get it cheaper, I agreed due to them having my car. I was first told that it would take 2 hours. Called for update around 4:00pm, my advisor was not available (no surprise there) nor was there a call returned. I had to wait on hold with a nice gentleman for the service department just to see that what was taking so long, after then talking with her a quarter to 5:00pm. She says Yeah, its ready you can come now. (10- points taken from Mazda) I arrived at Mazda and car was not finished nor ready. I finally got my car at 5:35pm and missed an important appointment.

Best part of the whole situation was that the diagnostic was actually $175.00 not $107.00.🙃 From now on I will be going out of my way and go to the location in DTLA or even the Valley at this point. Worst service and and customer service I have gotten at the Culver City location.</text>

<Review>Great service.

I work nights and when I brought the car in for a service today, they suggested I could leave the car and come pick it up after I've slept rather than wait in the dealership. They had it waiting for me when I got back, washed and even vacuumed inside! They had a great discount ($35 off of the service)  and offer free lyft pick up/drop off.

I wanted to share my exceptional experience working with Carl H, the manager of the service department at Culver City Mazda.

I bought my CX-5 new at the dealership about 3.5 months ago. About a week ago, I took it in to a hand car wash in the city. Something either with the temperature of the water or the solutions they used to clean the car caused scratches all over the hood of the car during drying, a couple were even down to the metal.

Pretty upset about what had happened, I took my car into the dealership and explained how the scratches appeared and that it was only 3 months old. Carl and his crew worked magic on the hood of my car, removing all the scratches including the two that were down to the metal. Cannot speak highly enough about how much of a pleasure it was to work with Carl and his team. Highly recommend purchasing from this dealership due to the incredible service provided to their customers.

Thank you, Carl and team!<//Review>

Both the service center and sales team are terrible. When I bought my car, they lost the key and had me wait for over 6 hours before they told me the key was lost. I didn’t get my car until the next day. The sales contract included free first oil change, when I brought my car in they charged me and told me they never give away oil changes - even after I showed them it was clearly listed in the contract. The software on my car was recalled, I brought the car in for an update- they told me they would only update the software if I paid $1,200 to fix the “spider webbing” on the screen - which is also a known defect on from Mazda and the dealership.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1603903568069, 'text': "Hello Lois,\nWe're very sorry to see the low rating and to hear about your experience.

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Leasing our Mazda
was a decent experience. But unfortunately at the end of our lease term we found out that the dealership FORGED our initials to increase residual value. Finance had a second lease agreement that had our forged initials. The only reason I found out is because I asked a ton of questions when the buyout numbers were off, and they sent us the second document. The initials were not even close to ours (mine were even the wrong letters). After hours on the phone with finance, they finally said they would open an investigation but we are going through a lawyer to get this resolved.

Lastly, when googling this, apparently it’s a common thing at car dealerships, so check your paperwork at lease end!</Text>< user>

I always enjoy bringing my car here. You will have to wait before they first get to you (even with an appointment so be prepared for that) but once they do, everything goes pretty quickly from there. They provide a free lyft ride (5 or 8 mile radius I believe) both ways while they service your car expeditiously. The work is always top notch and the service is done with a smile. I continually feel well taken care of when I come here.</text>

Mazda Roadside Assistance had to set me up with 2 different towing companies because CULVER CITY Mazda refused the Towing Company services...what kind of BS is that?? How do you refuse to accept a Mazda vehicle at YOUR Mazda dealership. I thought Mazda was an umbrella of Other Mazda team members...clearly their lack of being a team player is showing. Never ever coming back here.</text>

<review>I got a VERY good deal on culver city Mazda: thanks to David (sales) and Benny (manager).  They are both very nice and helped me to keep within my budget and get EXTRA stuff on my car!

The finance guy (sorry, dont know his name) was also super helpful and several good tips for me.  My new (used 2016 Grand Touring) have some scratches so they sent it to the body shop for repairs.  In the meantime, they loaned me a NEW 2019 CX-5 Grand Touring... OMG, I LOVE this car, its better than the used car I purchased.

After a week in the body shop, my baby looks just like NEW car... SUPER happy about it.

Just want to share my happy experience and GREAT deal on Culver City Mazda, they have Wonderful term here, everyone super helpful. I been many dealer and few Mazda dealer;, only Culver city Mazda are truly helpful and very straight forward, and they did not waste my time.

Car shopping is pain on your brain, body and its kills the time you can do something that is a lot of fun.
Was in car shopping online for 3 weekdays and 3 weekends, visit those " Good " deal online on real dealer,

I was looking for Rav4, CRV and CX5, Rav4 mpg is lower and price is higher than other 2, CRV is nice but interior material is ok, after drove CX-5, LOVE it!  MPG is same with CRV, but interior material is way better than CRV, and if you to " SPEED UP" ( very smooth speed up on Fwy and climb), CX-5 Grand Touring will be your best option, so FUN to drive and roomy.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7_ju3oHjP7sVom82AoHLTP6VXHkED5a6jdXeD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< GmapID>

This is my second lease at Culver City Mazda. Erick Reyes assisted me when I walked in. He was very friendly and helped me with my first lease. He answered all my questions and was very knowledgeable about all the cars that I was interested in. He truly is a fantastic sales associate and an asset to this store.

I decided to go with a newer model of the CX-5 and was impressed with all the new features and of course the Price! I am a very happy customer who will continue to lease my new vehicles with this fine establishment. They are always on point and come through with all the requests that I have asked about over the years. They go over and above with their service and support. I also would like to thank Leigh Balcher for being of assistance as well. He has an amazing personality, friendly, funny and full of knowledge.

Thanks Again Culver City Mazda! See you again in a few years!

Really shady dealership. There were scratches all over the side window and gauge cluster on our new car (didn't notice in the bright sun) and I am still waiting on a soft copy of the paperwork I signed. I've left voicemails and emails over the course of three weeks but the relevant individuals have been impossible to reach. Stay far away.</Review>

I purchased my car in the beginning of June, and it took almost 6 months to receive my license plates. In addition to that, I cancelled my GAP coverage in June and did not receive my refund until over 5 months later. For being a "highly rated" car dealership, this was absolutely the worst sales experience I have ever had. Tony, Richard, Rosie, and Roman were the individuals involved in my purchase. At one point, the dealership stopped responding to any important questions I had about either my EXPIRED temporary plates or my absence of a GAP refund check. It wasn't until I involved Mazda Customer Service that they decided to do something. Even then, they disregarded several of my emails and requests. I am not the type of person to write negative reviews, but the amount of neglect that has happened from this dealership regarding my situation is unacceptable. It should not take 6 months to receive plates, nor should it take 6 months to send a check. After all this, nobody once apologized to me for the trouble and inconvenience that they caused. Mazda Culver City has lost a customer, and I would never recommend this dealership to anyone. I would rate them 0 stars if I could.</Text>

I was in much need of a car. I wasn’t really sure what I expected to leave with or if I would leave with anything. Thanks to Max I was able to find something I completely love. Driving my new car seems unreal, and I love that it’s red. The whole process was straight to the point. Quick and painless. I left grateful and very happy with the experience and customer service I received.<//Review>

I am very disappointed by this dealership. I reached out to them last week for a quote and to set up a test drive scheduled it for this morning at 11am. I drive over there in time for the test drive and I am told there is no available parking in the lot. So I call the sales rep I was meeting, Tony and get sent to voicemail. The voicemail box is full. I then send an email with no response. Maybe if you helped future customers the parking lot full of cars being sold wouldn't be so full, just a thought. Overall wouldn't recommend.< /review>

< review>
Everyone on the staff was so friendly and welcoming.
Christian was extremely helpful and made the process painless and enjoyable. He was super easy to work with. We talked, we laughed and then we made a great deal.

He was very knowledgeable about the car and answered all of my questions.
He also went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my lease and helped me to keep within my budget. I couldn’t be happier with the whole process.

I got a follow-up email the day after I leased my car and really feel they are sincerely committed to making sure I have the best experience possible and that we cultivate a long lasting relationship.

Thank you Christian and all the wonderful people at Culver City Mazda!</review>

I took my 2015 Miata to Culver City Mazda. I had bought it and had issues with my transmission and I was super upset. George Mejia was my rep for the service. He was a good man even after dealing with my mood for being ripped off. He got them warranty company to install a new transmission after two failed attempts.

I left and it is doing great so far and nothing is missing like the reviews I have read.

Thanks,

While I was looking for a new SUV, after the online research left a voice message to this dealership, and got a call back from Tony Tehrani, I couldn't  believe that was able to close the deal in just five minutes over the phone with Tony where he was very aggressive with the quote. Drove to the dealer day after to pick the vehicle up and the customer service was awesome, worked with Rosie in Sales and Julio in Finance and overall my buying experience was excellent and would recommend this dealer ship for new cars< /Review>

<text>Very reputable dealership. I have leased a Mazda CX-5 three times in a row. Today is the first time I worked with Mazda Culver City, and it was a superior experience. I felt that I was being dealt with fairly and honestly throughout the negotiations and got what I know is a terrific deal.

I just leased a 2016 Mazda 3 and I absolutely love it! The sales team was very friendly and super helpful. I am a first time buyer and was really nervous and apprehensive about this experience. Most of the dealers I went to, though helpful, were obviously just trying to sell me whatever car they could. I got the impression that the team at Mazda had my best interest in mind. Bill was my salesman and from the start was very helpful in finding the perfect car for me. He also took a lot of time explaining all of the features of the car with me and assured me that I could contact him at any time with any questions I had. Benny took a lot of time going through the leasing process with me and answered all of my questions thoroughly. Will was also thorough in explaining all the paperwork, which I truly appreciated.  I also received a lot of input and advice from Max who was in the office during my time at the dealership. Overall, I was very well taken care of and in the end felt like I was making the best decision. Though I don't live in close proximity to this dealer, I know that I will definitely still service my car here because of the positive experience I had.<//review><rate>5</rate>< response>

Steve and Mazda services at culver were wonderful. It was the first time I went in for services and they were more than accommodating. They squeezed me in and made sure I was able to get to work on time. They even had time for the wash down which I thought I would have to come back to do. Great experience and very helpful!</Review>

Everyone here is great! This is the second Mazda I've leased @ CC and the team is awesome!! Roman is awesome to work with, he knows exactly what I was looking for, eliminated much of the back-and-forth you get with typical dealerships, and we quickly made a deal! Will and Benny were also great and took super great care of me! Thank you team for another awesome Mazda experience! LC< /review>

Class acts all around. My fiance and I came in to test drive a CX-5, I have been eyeing one for awhile. We had the pleasure of meeting David Castro who made the test drive process and our whole experience at the dealership FUN, RELAXED and positive. My lease was up on a sedan and I wanted to test drive a few more Mid Size SUV's to really get a feel for what I liked so we proceeded to a few more dealerships. Hands down, NO OTHER MID SIZE SUV compared to the Mazda CX-5 and no other dealership could replicate the warm, friendly, welcoming rapport David had established with us. It was a no brainer for us to return to Culver City Mazda and work on the deal. That's where David's manager Benny came in with full transparency and professionalism. Suffice to say, I have a new Mazda CX-5 now and I am 150% happy with the decision. David and Benny are professional, stand up and eager to work with YOU to get you into a new car! I can't recommend Culver City Mazda and David Castro especially enough.</Review>

Called on memorial day to see if they were still operating in normal business hours. The woman who answered had a very unprofessional tone and told me, “I don’t know, I hope so.” I said I would call back later then, and she asked why I would do that, and added, “are you gonna make an appointment, or...” Obviously I can’t make an appointment if I don’t know their business hours. Clearly I am not the only person who’s had bad experience with this receptionist. This is my only interaction with them; I decided to take my Mazda to Santa Monica instead.</text>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Awful client service. I called three days in advance and spoke with a salesperson about the car I wanted to test drive. I was specific about the model and trim, Mazda 3 premium trim. I called the morning of my appt and reemphasized the car I wanted to drive, premium trim sedan, and confirmed timing. The timing of my appt shifted (no big deal) and I had to remind my salesperson that I wanted the sedan and not the hatch, also that I was traveling there specifically to drive the car and was on a tight schedule.

I arrived to the wrong car. It was the hatch premium trim, he tried to keep me there my saying the preferred had the same engine etc... and wanted me to drive it but he lost me. Would have bought right there if he had the car. Now Culver City has lost my business forever. Awful client service.< /text>< pictures>

I was helped after a few minutes wait.   It was very crowded that day, but the representative who serviced me was very kind and welcoming.  He was quick and efficient in pulling me up in his system.
I was able to sit comfortably in the waiting area and work using my laptop.  Every question I asked was responded to with a friendly and clear answer.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.  The cashier was nice and friendly, smiling and exchanging pleasant chit-chat as she took my payment.  When it was all  done I went to get in my car and found a nice sweet surprise waiting for me!! I was delighted to see that my car had been given a nice wash!!!!!!  I was planning on washing it that day, but no need as it was already done!!  These guys know how to treat their customers!!!!< /text>

<Text>I am happy that Culver Mazda was willing to work on the price.  Yes, they should not have let me walk out of the dealership once, but it's part of the process.  Tony was a likable guy to deal with.  Very funny and polite at the same time.  Mazda3 is a good car, both in performance and looks.

I turned in a leased car before the lease was over...leased the same car but a newer model. No one mentioned a word about mileage. About 3 months later I got a call from corporate saying I owe $400 for going over my mileage from my previously leased car. Really bad to not say anything at the time. Corporate said they wouldn’t know but that is complete BS. If you turn in a car and lease a new car they could very easily ask what your lease allowed for mileage and tell you that you would owe if you went over!! Pretty basic. I didn’t think I would need to pay since I rolled over into a new car. If I had known I very liked would not have leased another Mazda, which I now probably won’t the next time my lease is over.

And yeah, service can be spotty. The first time I had my serviced there it was horrible. They had my car for the entire day because someone dropped the ball.< /Text>

Superb customer service - they provided a ride from and to their location to my office (they will drop you off anywhere within an 8 mi radius) and in addition to the regular oil change/tire rotation service, they also cleaned the car interior and gave the outside a wash. Everyone I interacted with was very courteous and professional, and I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a Mazda dealership/service location.< /Text>

<review>These guys provided an amazing experience from the start of my new car search in January 2015 to the end of the hunt in June! Richard and Rosie were my initial points-of-contact; they provided a warm, welcoming experience and Richard was very patient as I moved from total indecision to well-researched shopper to satisfied lessee when he and Tony helped me settle on a brand new Mazda3. I absolutely love the car, but what makes it even more satisfying is the relationship that I've built with Culver City Mazda.

During my lengthy search I visited over 20 different dealerships in the LA area looking for the perfect car and every other place tried to hustle and pressure me into making a snap decision so they could get a quick sale. From the start, I could tell that Culver City Mazda was different. They operate at the highest level of integrity, which is why I came back there once I decided that a Mazda3 was the model that would best suit my lifestyle.

Everyone at this dealership was a joy to work with, from the receptionists on the phone to Will, the financing manager, to Richard and Tony. They know a lot about cars but they treated me with respect and never went "over my head" with car speak.

As we were hashing out the specifics of the lease, Tony and Will conducted themselves in a relaxed, confident and dignified demeanor; they answered all my questions plainly and didn't give me a run around, which is what I got pretty much everywhere else.

What made it even more attractive was the general workplace atmosphere. In the midst of an unimaginably hectic Saturday, with a lobby full of patrons and support technicians flying around, Tony Tehrani was the picture of calm, handling requests and treating everyone (co-workers, subordinates and potential customers) with the kind of respect we normally reserve for C-level executives.

I could go on and on and on about this place's excellence, but really you should go see for yourself. Truly EXCEPTIONAL!< /review>< resp>

<review>I purchased a vehicle here. It has turned out to be a good car for a fairly decent price. However, the product is not what I have issue with - the sales & service staff is why I am giving 2 stars. There was too much unnecessary deception & stress resulting from it.
Examples: 1) finding a vehicle (after the ones seen on their site were not there), test driving, deciding I like it, making an offer - then being told that the price given to me initially had been a 'mistake'...
2)then having to deal with the "certified pre-owned" certification not actually being completed up to Mazda standards,
3) bringing it back to the dealership and being lied to again,
4) having to call Mazda Corporate and get them involved
5) then take the vehicle to another dealership to have them confirm that several key points of the certification had not been done such as resetting the engine computer (which directly affects engine performance), broken wipers not fixed, very worn tires not being replaced...
And every time you call this place you end up getting transferred around to way way way too many people - all while being given excuses & very little help.  Since I purchased the car, I have met several people who had similar experiences wit this dealership.
Thankfully Mazda makes good vehicles and I have not had any problems with the actual car itself - only the shady antics of the sales & service teams at Culver City Mazda. They pretend, and even try in some instances, to be helpful - but frequently do not follow through, giving excuse after excuse why they cant help. It is stressful, deceptive and totally unnecessary.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Update: Came over President's day weekend got the deal that I wanted for my mother now she is happy with her M3 touring. Great service as always. Too bad I didn't get any fun gift mail like I did when I got my M2 back in 2014 from Galvin Mazda.< /review>

I had a great experience getting service here. They included Lyft rides to and from the dealership while my car was being worked on, and they also included a free car wash. Lance helped me out, and he was great, taking the time to explain everything they checked and fixed.</Review>

<text>I have to say this:  I had a great experience at Mazda.  The sales man I had the good fortune of running into was experienced, knowledgeable, patient and understanding.  I got the car that I didn't really know I needed, but now just love it.

Everyone was very helpful.

Thank you.<//text></record>

The people at Culver City Mazda were absolutely incredible! They helped sort out my service issues as well as helping me better understand my purchase agreements for service and warranty. I will most definitely recommend this location for all of your service needs. Worth the drive from Santa Monica!</text>

<pics>None</pics><text>I purchased a vehicle here. It has turned out to be a good car for a fairly decent price. However, the product is not what I have issue with - the sales & service staff is why I am giving 2 stars. There was too much unnecessary deception & stress resulting from it.
Examples: 1) finding a vehicle (after the ones seen on their site were not there), test driving, deciding I like it, making an offer - then being told that the price given to me initially had been a 'mistake'...
2)then having to deal with the "certified pre-owned" certification not actually being completed up to Mazda standards,
3) bringing it back to the dealership and being lied to again,
4) having to call Mazda Corporate and get them involved
5) then take the vehicle to another dealership to have them confirm that several key points of the certification had not been done such as resetting the engine computer (which directly affects engine performance), broken wipers not fixed, very worn tires not being replaced...
And every time you call this place you end up getting transferred around to way way way too many people - all while being given excuses & very little help.  Since I purchased the car, I have met several people who had similar experiences wit this dealership.
Thankfully Mazda makes good vehicles and I have not had any problems with the actual car itself - only the shady antics of the sales & service teams at Culver City Mazda. They pretend, and even try in some instances, to be helpful - but frequently do not follow through, giving excuse after excuse why they cant help. It is stressful, deceptive and totally unnecessary.< /text>< Date>

Staff was great and very friendly. I didn't feel pressured at all. Only downside was that due to the small size of this place they have one model of each of their models (usually fully loaded). If you want to see more they take you to their lot 10 minutes away. I would definitely recommend this place!<//Text>

I have had some extremely frustrating experiences with car dealerships in the past (you can see my review of Browning Mazda in Cerritos), but this was the exact opposite! And most importantly, I love my new car and feel great about the process at Culver City Mazda. If you are thinking about a Mazda, I would highly recommend checking out this dealership and ask for Max!<//Text></record></dataset><record>
<text>The best leasing experience ever. This dealership is interested in working with your budget and options, opened about prices, Richard was willing to make all agreements over the phone, and the dealership did it's best to get me into a new car. In fact, it took less than 1 hour from the moment I stepped on the lot to leaving it in CX-5.
You will be treated as a valued customer because everyone cares about your shopping experience. After the purchase, Culver City Mazda follows up with you to make sure you're happy with your car and to provide any support needed. Culver City Mazda is an example of what the auto dealership should be.
Huge appreciation to the team that worked on my car: Richard, Tony, Maria, and Rosie. Contact anyone and you'll get the best customer care.< /text><response>{'time': 1512962399462, 'text': 'Maxim, we are so happy to hear that you had such a good experience working with our dealership.

I purchased a new Mazda CX-5 from another dealer a few weeks ago, and yesterday noticed a clicking sound from one of the tires. When I inspected it, there was a nail puncturing the tire. I brought in my car to Culver City Mazda since it's actually the closest dealer to where I live.

They couldn't find a record of the pricey service plan that should cover this repair (I have to call the original dealer about this), but Ken in the service department offered to inspect it to see if it's something repairable.

Turns out it just needed a little plug, an $18 service. Since I recently purchased the car, he provided the service for free, and even threw in a car wash!  Remember that I purchased this car at a different dealer.

It was really a great experience, and if the purpose was to bring me back the next time I need service, it definitely worked. Everyone was very courteous and professional.  I brought it in early on a weekday morning and all in all it took about an hour which I felt was reasonable.

5 stars!</review>

Had a really good experience with Sam (who is very down to earth) and his team.  Benny is quite the sales manager, and they both took their time and made sure I was satisfied.  I absolutely love the new Mazda 3 Hatchback and its features.  It's fun to drive, a great color (soul red), and the Bose speakers are so nice!</Text>

< Review>
I needed an oil change. I drop my car off under that premise. A couple hours later Lance calls me an says I need "induction system service". I ask him how much that will be, he tells me the price and says "so we'll get that done and call you back." And hangs up. I think it sounds odd, but think "if I need it..." I get back to the shop and ask him what the extra thing was. Lance explains it, and I leave. Still feeling odd, I Google it, and it turns out they worked me for an extra $200. Completely unnecessary. I later notice on the receipt it says "Customer requests perform complete induction system service." Wow. No I didn't. Culver City Mazda stole $200 from me. They never asked, "Do you want this done?" Or gave me other options, just "We're doing this, we'll call you in 45 minutes." Click. I will never return to this place, and if you decide to double check EVERYTHING, Google EVERYTHING and stick to only what you want done. Once again, the man who put me through this was Lance.</Review>

<text>My experience with Culver City Mazda has been very positive, starting from the time you arrive for your appointment till you leave. You are greeted upon arrival, and told how long (5-10 minutes) your wait will be till a service advisor checks your car in. After check-in, it is very pleasant to sit in their waiting area, have excellent coffee (and/or donuts), and read the newspaper, or browse the Internet on your phone or laptop. Culver City Mazda is moving to a new customer management software, so I was greeted by an advisor with everything on their iPad. I didn't have to wait at the service desk like I did before. Nice to see.

When the servicing was complete, someone came and found me (rather than announce on the PA), to let me know that the car was ready. Plus my car got a complimentary car wash!! Also a nice touch.

Overall, a pleasant experience. Happy to be a Mazda customer.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The best leasing experience ever. This dealership is interested in working with your budget and options, opened about prices, Richard was willing to make all agreements over the phone, and the dealership did it's best to get me into a new car. In fact, it took less than 1 hour from the moment I stepped on the lot to leaving it in CX-5.
You will be treated as a valued customer because everyone cares about your shopping experience. After the purchase, Culver City Mazda follows up with you to make sure you're happy with your car and to provide any support needed. Culver City Mazda is an example of what the auto dealership should be.
Huge appreciation to the team that worked on my car: Richard, Tony, Maria, and Rosie. Contact anyone and you'll get the best customer care.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
I visited this location a few days ago . I was a first time buyer. I moved out here from Florida . Thinking I was going to get the car I've been wanting. First I want to say you guys need more sales people I waited for about 10 mins then I walked out . And secondly I want to say the Mazda receptionist (older woman age range mid 40s ) was on her phone and ignoring the calls that were coming in. Im glad i did a walk in and not a phone call. I did not even get greeted when i walked in. If you hire people to sit in the front desk for them to be on there phones you guys may want to double check resumes.< /Review>

<Review>I purchased my car there because of the welcoming smiles of Tony Tehrani, Richard Diaz and Rosie Milad. From that day the attention, professionalism that these individuals bring would make anyone want to buy a car and get it serviced there. In the service department Steven Ruiz .has assisted me with a welcoming smile and a how can we help you attitude. When I have purchased parts Manny Reyes also welcomes you with a smile. .Jeremy Moreno is always there to make sure that if you need anything he will take care of it. I met Rolly Ramos years ago when I needed the back glass replaced and ever since then when I am getting the car serviced or picking up a part he has always greeted me with a smile and the same attitude of how can we help. I must say that Sal Gonzalez is extremely fortunate to have these individuals working and representing Culver City Mazda & Volvo.  They ROCK!</Review><Time>1556758652456</Time>< resp>

Having never purchased a new car from a dealership before (previous cars were always used and purchased directly from the previous owners), I was nervous; I had always heard about how hellish the experience could be with high pressure tactics and time consuming meetings in windowless rooms. Thankfully, this dealership bucks the trend; my experience was fantastic, and everyone that I dealt with was awesome. While I was made aware of some possible add-ons and price points, I did not at all feel pressured to add any of those extra bells and whistles. The financing meeting was swift, and everything was presented in a way that was very easy to understand. It was a very pleasant experience all around, and I would indeed recommend the dealership to anyone looking for a new car.<//Review>

Today I spoke with Siya - Sales person in phone call, requested for test drive appointment, he said yes available, since I stay nearby was there in 30mins. Once I visit enquired about my visa which is fine and finally gave another appointment for test drive which he could have done it on phone call also he was not interested in giving any details. Highly disappointed.< /Review>

I can’t say how incredibly pleased I am with this dealership. From the cleanliness to the attentiveness to the care, you are top notch. Above and beyond!

As if the Lyft service wasn’t enough, your team took care of annoying tree sap that had been on my car for a couple of weeks that I had no idea how to remove...Without me asking!

I mean, come on.
Is this a Maserati dealership or what?

Thank you for always treating me with such class, such professionalism.
I’ve been a longtime waitress by day so I know what’s behind what you do. And it’s exquisite!

Thanks guys. I hope you all prosper greatly!

(p.s. I’m not sure who my service people have been the past two visits, but please check your records, as they are included in this too. Tony is the person I originally worked with for my lease. and he’s wonderful - the reason I’ll be returning at lease end. But i want to make sure that everyone who’s served me is given credit, including the sweet receptionist with the fro :) )</Text>

Took my car to be serviced at Culver City Mazda, and won’t be bringing it back again.

My experience left a lot to be desired; starting with the Lyft they insisted I use not showing (had to call my own to get back to work), continuing into 2 calls where they requested approval to do $2,600 of service (and getting laughter from every 3rd party I checked that price and assessment of services with after), and ending up with them trying to give me back my car with the key literally broken off in the ignition after I declined the last round of services.

After having to invest extra time auditing the work done and finding new service partners, it’s not over: I’m still getting requests for surveys every few days despite continuously declining... so here it is.<//Review>

Car is awesome like all Mazdas, but this dealership is a circus, sales reps/managers going back on their word, bad and slow customer service. I’ve had to come several times to the dealership in person (for the same deal) because they keep messing up the paperwork.</Text>

It's a common thing to dread buying a car, and dealing with the 'car salesman' stereotype.  I can happily say that of the various dealers I went to, only one bordered on that, and even there was an OK experience.

But I have to say the my experience with Culver City Mazda was heads above the rest, and a stellar experience.  Working with Dan on two different days (I'm a deliberative buyer), and late into the evening on Wednesday to sell me my new Mazda3.  He was helpful, friendly, listened to my needs, and really made me feel he was working to get me in the right car for me ... not just the right car for the bottom line.  And after making a great deal,  Will was fantastic.  Made the paperwork process easy, I would say as fast-as-it-can-be, and both just all around great guys to work with.

Highly recommend.  Will absolutely go back.<//text>

<Review>VERY MISLEADING. I had a great experience at this Mazda with sales associate Ray and his manager. They met my needs we found a middle ground on price and I liked the CX5 more than the VW Tiguan I was 1 minute away from getting until I fell upon Mazda right before I went to VW to finalize my lease. The one thing that held me back and was the deciding factor was Carplay. They told me Carplay was coming for my model and I only had to wait until; December and it would be available. Then it was pushed to March. Then in March they told me my model was not included with the free upgrade for Carplay and I would need to pay $400+ to install it. It feels like false advertising and like I was lied to in order to finalize the deal. I've now not had Carplay for 9 months and they will not install it unless I pay another $400+ - VERY SHADY. I was told by Ray and his manager that unfortunately they could only give me a 10% discount. Make sure you're not getting mislead when you finalize your lease.<//Review>< Pics>

POOR costumer service in the service department. George in service is rude and talks down to customers, especially women. He is chauvinistic and needs to be properly trained. My interactions with him today were disturbing. It is too bad that loyal customers have to be treated so poorly by a horrible person that is supposedly a customer service representative. He reflects poorly on this dealership and the Mazda corporation. He should NEVER tell someone thy are "crazy" and they "dont know what they are talking about" This is unacceptable and inappropriate behavior for an employee...regardless of the situation. Shame on You Culver City Mazda for employing such a rude miserable person.</text>

<text>I received an email promotion for a free service visit so I decided to take my Mazda in to Culver City Mazda for the first time. The staff was very friendly! The new renovated Mazda side is very nice! And once I was informed that my car would take up to 3 hours to be ready I was provided with a shuttle (less than 5 miles away) ride. The prices are pretty competitve for maintenance services so I think I would return.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Dan, Will, and Charlie were unbelievably helpful when it came to putting me into my new CX-5! I went to the other dealerships in the area, and Culver City Mazda was by far the nicest, no haggling, straight forward dealership I went to. Their main goal is to put you in a car that you feel good about at a price you can afford. Hats off to these guys.< /text>< Date>

They also told me that my upper motor mount needed to be replaced. I had another Mazda dealer look at the motor mount and they said it was fine.
I know independent repair shops often get a bad reputation for prescribing unnecessary and costly service to customers, but I wouldn't have expected it from a Mazda dealer. I'm a big Mazda fan, but will not be giving Culver City Mazda any more business.< /review>< user>

<review>Everything was great. Promptly helped. Car was fixed in very little time. My only issue was that since my gas gauge had become clogged, they had recommended not using the lowest grade gas (which Mazda3's are able to use). So it is less of an issue with the service department and more with the company in general. But overall, I'd highly recommend getting your car serviced there.</review></record>

I went to get my car checked for a general check up, and the problem was fixed but the salesperson I spoke with tried to upsell me and said my ‘shocks were leaking’ and that my ‘serpentine belt was cracked.’ I didn’t believe it and didn’t get those things replaced (it would’ve been an extra $700) and a month later I had it rechecked at a different Mazda dealership and they said nothing was wrong, without even having me tell them about the shocks and belt. Don’t let them upsell you, otherwise they fix stuff fine.<//text>

DO NOT GO HERE!!!

Buying a car? Service? Lease? No, no, no! They will rip you off!

This is by far the worst Mazda dealership.

I have been a loyal Mazda owner and am baffled by the service. Sales, finance, and service made this the worst experience that I have had at a dealership.

The sales team was unclear and added fees/upcharges to every route that we tried to take. When I questioned the fees, I was treated poorly and found out that they were just trying to nickel and dime each part of the transaction. They tried selling gap insurance when we were even on payments (no need for gap)! When we questioned the gap, we were once again treated like idiots and found out that we were correct the entire time. Do not buy new, used, or a lease from this dealership!

The finance team will not keep their word and will try to up-charge you. The interest rate is much higher than market average so do not finance through this dealership! To drop interest rate, they will try to sell warranty or maintenance packages. The maintenance package comes out to overpriced oil changes! Warranty does not cover any major repairs.. not worth it.

The service team will not keep you informed of the status of your car. They will also try to up-sell you poor quality service. I would suggest a different Mazda dealership for this. The other two dealerships that checked the car said everything looked fine, but this location tried upselling multiple parts that “needed to be replaced.”

DO NOT GO HERE! I would suggest any other dealer in the area.

I am very unimpressed.< /text>

< review>
While shopping for a Mazda CX-5, someone in the business recommended that I meet with Tony, the fleet manager at the Culver City Mazda location. When I made an appointment to meet with him, he blew me off and had me work with one of his associates, which was fine because I know they’re busy. I met with Rosie, who truly created a great experience. She was professional, knowledgeable, and nice to work with. After two test drives, I was ready to buy the car. I found a better deal at a different location, but because Rosie had put time and effort into the sale, I gave her an opportunity to earn the commission by countering the deal. She said she could beat the price by $300 and threw in a due bill for Apple CarPlay and some curtesy rubber mats. After inspecting the car, which was excellently detailed, I was ready to pull the trigger and sign some paperwork. I met with Richard, the Finance Manager of F&I. Initially, I found him to also be professional and courteous, but he quickly revealed himself as a misogynist who attempted to take advantage of me as a woman and first time car buyer. He quoted me at 6% interest rate, which you know is absurd if you’re familiar with how financing works. I was putting down more than half of the car’s worth and have a fairly decent credit score (680 with trans union and 733 with Equifax). He repeatedly called me “sweetie” and told me that there was nothing he could do to reduce the interest rate and that only the bank can do that, which was clearly untrue. After telling him that I was leaving, he left to “get approval” from the fleet manager to lower my interest rate. I thought only the banks could do that? He then gave me an interest rate just under 4%. When I told him that was still ridiculous and I was leaving, he said “sweetie, you just don’t understand how all of this works.” They clearly were not going to give me a reasonable interest rate, so I asked about leasing instead because I know that Mazda has a 0% interest rate for leasing. Tony and Richard gave me the worst quote I’ve ever heard of in my life. Putting $6,000 down to pay $300 a month for a MAZDA is absurd. They very obviously did not want my business, so I left. The only thing I feel bad about is the work that Rosie put in. Yesterday I found the same car for the same price at Galpin Mazda. They offered me a 2.4% interest rate and I gave my business to them instead. Claudia Campos was my salesperson and she was phenomenal, as was the finance manager Paris. It was a smooth process and I drove off the lot last night.

TLDR: Do not buy your car from Culver City. Go to Galpin Mazda instead. The Fleet Manager, Tony, at Culver City was rude and the Financial Manager, Richard was the most misogynistic person I’ve ever dealt with professionally. They will take advantage of you if you’re a woman and they think you don’t know what you’re doing. I do not recommend giving them your business.< /review>

Absolutely the worst car buying experience I’ve ever had.  I showed up with a list of six cars. They said to look at the cars I would have to go to a lot 15 minutes away. At the lot none of the cars were washed so it was difficult to discern if the cars were scratched.  Then we learned he had only brought keys for two out of the six cars. The first car didn’t have any gas. So we could only drive it around the block. The next car didn’t even start. Apparently the battery was dead. So he tried to jumpstart it and it still wouldn’t start. We had to wait another 20 minutes for somebody to bring out another key though they were only bring one more key. The next car they tried to start also had a dead battery.  Then we made the salesmen drive us back to the office.  Where were were told we would see a manager.  After waiting another 15 minutes alone, we started to leave- passing 3 mangers sitting in offices alone playing on their cellphones.  It wasn’t until we were in our car about to drive away that the manager showed up.  Please save yourself the trouble and do not shop here. At no point was anyone apologetic for our miserable experiences.</Review>

< review>
I recently purchased a CX-5 from my hometown of Culver City and I was treated well by the sales department as well as the finance department.  I truly recommend Mazda of Culver City for any purchase of Mazda car or suv.   What I like the best is that Christian, who was the sales person, never pushed or needled me to death while I was making a very expensive decision.  I appreciate that a lot!!< /review>

<Text>Obsessed with financing and leasing, which is understandable. Don't care to waste their time that is considered as "not worth" their time. Pretended to be respectful but fake.

After we came to the conclusion that I can't do finance/lease due to my visa status (which is understandable), I called in to get a quote for buying with cash. Sales manager didn't even care to let me finish what I have to say, jumped straight in with a typical line "let me cal you back in 10" and we all know what he meant lol

Good luck with financing with them, coz they sure will like it. Although, don't forget there are other Mazda dealerships :) never hurt to have options.</Text>< Gmap_id>

When showing up to buy a new car please ask for Christian Libby, He was an amazing advisor and went above and beyond to help me find the car i wanted. Now, i dont live in town and he made everything possible to do everything via phone and email then drove the car to my house to sign all the papers. The best experience I've ever had with a dealership. Would definitely recommend Christian to anyone buying a Mazda.

NOW, if i could give the detailer a review and stars there would not be any stars highlighted. If i were this car dealership i would consider hiring a new detailer that knew how to do their job. Drove back down after purchasing the car to get the scratches out of the passenger side door. After detailing there were swirl marks from the buffing left on the car. I had to hire my own detailer to fix the mistake that should have never been made by the dealership. Save your cars paint and wash the car yourself. The "free" car wash is not worth it.

As for the service center, thats a joke. The only reason i went there was because Mazda Corp wouldnt cover warranty on the car unless it was done at the place of purchase. Everyone is extremely rude, doesn't want to hear what you have to say about whats wrong with the car and asks irrelevant questions stating that "they are doing their job." The service center had my car for maybe 5 days and when told it would be done by a certain time, 5 hours later of sitting in the lobby the problem hadn't been solved (mind you i live 3 hours away from culver city). I was sent back to my local dealer to have the problem fixed because they couldnt figure it out. For your own sanity just stay away from culver city mazda.<//text>

I recently purchased a CX-5 from my hometown of Culver City and I was treated well by the sales department as well as the finance department.  I truly recommend Mazda of Culver City for any purchase of Mazda car or suv.   What I like the best is that Christian, who was the sales person, never pushed or needled me to death while I was making a very expensive decision.  I appreciate that a lot!!<//text>

<Text>I don't understand how anyone can have a positive experience with this place. After calling there multiple times for service and being transferred around, disconnected and intercepted by what sounded like a  linguistically challenged 14 yr old girl who promised to have someone call me back. I drove down to the dealer and spoke face to face with the service advisor. He assured me the parts for my vehicle recall where in stock and was eager to start the job (all day job) the next morning. I was told there would be a loaner car available. Having worked in the Auto business as a Sales Manager for many years I have learned to always call an confirm the day of the appt. before driving all the way down there.

Well my worst fears were realized when the person I spoke with was no longer in that dept. , another person said He wasn't in today etc.. Then I spoke to Mazda Service since I was allowed to explain everything to 2 people before they told me I was speaking to Volvo Service Dept.
Finally I was told not to bother coming in as the parts were NOT IN STOCK as I was promised the day before. "well some of them but not all of them, they are back ordered"  (favorite term used by dealers to say beat it! its not happening today")Of course all of this said with an apathetic , no apology attitude. Of Course they would have no respect for Customers time, schedules or loss of a morning etc..
I have one word for this place: Dysfunctional!
They are lucky they are selling Mazdas and we owners love the cars or they wouldn't even be in business.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1501094312950, 'text': 'Aden, we are sorry that you believe you were misled by our dealership and we are concerned with the issues that you have mentioned.

We agreed on the trade value and the lease price upfront (over email in fact). When i turned up I was expecting to be directed to talk to the sales manager, changing agreement, etc instead there was absolutely no haggling or changing what was previously communicated (many dealerships in the area would do well to learn from these guys). I am extremely impressed with the dealership, particularly Tony, Max and Rozy. We will be coming here again and recommend anyone looking for either a Mazda or Volvo to visit and ask for Tony. Time is money and I know i can't afford to waste my time. These guys are phenomenal - can't believe i'm saying that about a car dealership! But it's 100% true!<//review>< Pics>

Yes, I know.. did review Culver City Volvo but I do Own a Mazda as well. Even tho they are the same company you can tell they are different. Of course they are more mazda waiting to be serviced than the volvo side so there is more of a wait  From the start they are super helpful. Steve Ruiz was my Service Adviser a couple of weeks ago when i went for an oil change. He was very professional!! and was even joking around with me. He adviced me of what comes with an oil change like a muti-point inspection. When I was in the waiting room he even offered me coffee and water. and was checking if i needed anything. at the end of my service when it came to pay ( here it comes the add ons) he went though all the info of my car. the life of the brakes....tires...battery.. didnt sell me stuff i did not need!!! Steve you are the man!  very honest man and company!!! been coming since 2014. and will keep on going! thanks about Culver City Mazda!!!</Review>

I few months ago I went to this dealership to take my Mazda 3 5 doors 2011 for oil change adjust a general check after I drove all the way from NYC to LA, I told them that I feel that my car has a little kick that didn't feel right. They charged me almost 500 dollars for oil change and the check for the kick and the breaks as well and didn't find anything, now my car has become worst than before and I believe is the transmission fluid that has to be replace, something that didn't even mention. I wanted to check a new Mazda CX5 and there were not body around from the sales department and the only person that was around told me that the car was locked...

After I took my car out of the this dealership overtime I go over 55 miles per hour the steering wheel starts to shake and my car wasn't like that at all, I called them to complain about that and they told me that I didn't pay for balancing or alignment and also that they did the tire rotation and after that my car is shaking.

The person that I spoke to told me that the manager will call me to see what can be done... I am still waiting for this phone call... In other words stay away from this place< /Text>

I plan to head to CC Mazda for car service,  I went through the  customer reviews , I saw  respond by the owner to the positive review of customers but I didn't see one for negative review,  I assume the owner need to give more attention to the negetive once which help to enhance his/her customer servie at the same time help new customers to consider this place  for their Aout buying or service needs. Don't undermined review owner!!!< /Review>

<review>Beware -- the sales person Jeffrey and I agreed to a price of a Mazda CX 5 over the phone which I confirmed with him to be sure three times. Spent the whole weekend on this --test driving, researching, negotiating. We come to a deal Sunday evening. I got to the dealer to do the final paperwork Monday night, and they tried to jack the price up $200 without me noticing! Maria wouldn't honor our deal and they let me walk. Jeffrey even admitted that we had agreed on the figure, but Maria still said, "no."

Unbelievable. Went to Santa Monica Mazda the same night and they accepted the deal Culver City Mazda rejected. Ha!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I was in the market for a brand new car. Previous to visiting Culver City Mazda I had visited many car dealerships of various brands to narrow down my choices including Mazda in Van Nuys. After my visit to the Van Nuys Mazda I was very nervous about dealing with Mazda salespeople. I felt as though there was a lot of dishonesty and contradiction in statements made by the dealership.

I decided to visit Culver City Mazda because of a great offer I received by email. I then made an appointment with Lee. Driving in to Culver City Mazda I saw the small delarship due to construction. I immediately thought this experience will probably be a disaster. To my surprise everyone was very organized. Pulling in we immediately were greeted by someone who took the car I was in and parked it for us. Lee then came outside soon after to greet us and introduce us to Michael who sat us down and discussed the exact car I wanted. He was extremely knowledgeable in all of Mazda cars. I was very impressed. After discussing the type of car, Michael drove us to the other lot to pick out the car. Michael was very friendly and easy to have a conversation with.

Now that I had picked out the car it was time to talk numbers with Lee. Like Michael, Lee was very easy to talk to and addressed all of my concerns in pricing. To make a long story short he wasn't going to let us leave without my new car. I believe Lee was honest in the numbers presented and did what he could to work out a very fair deal for the car that both him and I could agree on.

Next was the financing department. I met with Will who went over all the paperwork with me so that I could understand exactly what I was signing for. He too was very friendly and knowledgeable.

Overall I have to say this dealership was one of the best I have ever been to or purchased a car from. There is almost a family type vibe between all the workers making for a very enjoyable experience for their customers. I definitely recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking to purchase a Mazda. I will more than likely be returning to this dealership when it's time for my next car.< /review><Response>{'time': 1470938249052, 'text': 'Hello Stephanie, and thank you very much for taking the time to write us a review here in addition to Yelp.

Called ahead to make appointment to change airbag for a recall, get there, drop the car, take Uber to work. Wait 2h, get a call to tell me they didn't have the part and I can come pick up the car. I said ok, will be there in 30min. Take Uber back, get there in 30min. Wants to grab my keys. The car is getting a complimentary "wash". Took 25mins to hose down the car. Worst "cleaning" job I've seen.

Horrible, they are always "swamped" ( I drive past it and see tumble weeds just to check how swamped they are). I try and make appointments everytime and never able to get one. STAR mazda is the best choice to go and always go above and beyond for anyone. Culver city mazda won't be receiving my business at all.<//review>

< Review>
Went here to check out a used car. This dealership is TINY. You'll miss it if you're not searching for it. At the end of the day it wasn't the right fit for me, but customer service was welcoming.</Review>

<rating>2</rating><Review>I've been trying to connect to someone to lease a 29,000 dollar car and I can't get a single call back. This is frustrating. Other dealers call me back in no time or simply pickup the phone when I call.
If I was the manager of Culver City Mazda I would be very upset to know that my sales force is not promptly calling back our customers.
I'll still try once more but I wanted this to be made public so CCM can know what is going on.<//Review>< pictures>

Hace un mes realice cambio de aceite en Culver City Mazda, unos días después observó mancha de aceite en mi garage, decidí ir al dealer de South Mazda. Me informan que el tapón está flojo y que el aceite de la transmisión está muy por arriba de lo requerido.</Text>< Time>
