Here for the antique flea market, fun to walk and see some of the creative  one of a kinds you can find here. However,  there was one selling benches that were made with a 2x6, simple all the way, $175. No. For a little more another vendor had gorgeous natural wood, sturdy top and legs. Wish I'd taken a photo. Definitely a must see place to go. Third Sunday of the month, wear comfortable shoes and sunscreen with a hat.</Review>

<Review>It was a very good school and has great diversity.  The Political program is substandard and the only downfall to this institution.< /Review>< user_id>

<text>LBCC professors and counselors were both professional and helpful. I was forced to graduate from CSULB without being able to complete a minor I need for my career. Then I was misled for a graduate program that never exist and a faulty appeal process. I ended up in LBCC, where I was guided into the career path I wanted. It felt almost like a private school with small class sizes and professors always willing to help. This is the best college to start with and receive proper guidance!</text></record></dataset><record>

LBCC gave me a new start to life when I moved to Long Beach. I'm thankful for the incredibly supportive professors, counselors, and resources provided. As long as students are responsible, set goals, and meet with academic counselors the experience should be nothing short of great. I'm still considered an out-of-state student, and will be receiving my associates for transfer this spring. Last week I was accepted to my school of choice and couldn't be more grateful for my experience.</review>

The school is decent. Decent people, great teachers and good luck getting parking (park at the stadium for the first week or two if you drive. If someone is dropping you off, try going early. Around 7:30 is when traffic starts).

What I want to inform new students is the financial aid office is horrible at explaining how the FASFA works with new students, some did not even have the patience. I would suggest calling a representative through the FASFA website. They have more patience and you don't have to get in line multiple times (I did that a lot in freshman year).

The food at the cafeteria from what I remember was okay. The food was also overpriced. If you can, go to the food bank on campus. The nurse's office also has snacks but you can only grab one item. If you have the funds, there are restaurants nearby. Also, if you can and have the funds, go buy a pizza and share with others. (You have no idea how much other students or friends appreciate it).

Lastly, don't forget to say hello and good morning to everyone. Teachers are nicer to you and it helps break the ice for other students.< /text>

<Review>Students really take a long time to graduate from here. It's just amazing that its faculty don't put enough care for its students so they can graduate on time. Students there become super super seniors even when they are full students. I know this because I compare my time at ELAC (2 years 1/2) with my ex-girlfriend at LBCC. Surprisingly it just not only one case but from more people going there and it just sucks the lack of interest from the school.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>The welcome center/offices provide little to zero help. They scam you by saying you can attend two semesters for free even with promise 2.0, but then get you in as much debt as you can. The fact that you are required to apply for financial aid is pointless when they say you can attend for free, the only time you need it is for CSU/UC/Uni. People say that it doesn't go back to the government but, in reality it does.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Counseling at LAC really sucks. They’re so rude when you ask to make an appointment and when you receive the appointment they don’t help you at all. They don’t make you feel “helped” or “welcomed.”
I always see counselors walking around chit chatting, sitting and eating snacks, taking their sweet time instead of trying to put the effort to help students.</Review>

Poor, low quality non native English professors who use a lot of unnecessary profanity. The Leadership Faculty is very bias and uncaring to taking reports of faculty for misconduct or display of inappropriate role model, English speaking skills. Often the Financial Aid Office makes mistakes. This college frequently requests large tax amounts to be taken from your taxes for unnecessary remodeling beyond the $15,000 mark. It has had remodeling several times in recent years. Note that Governor Schwarzenegger was head over Community Colleges and elected in by CA Majority. Note that Governor Schwarzenegger has low level integrated English speaking capacity and has minimal noteworthy college education himself. This college wasted a lot of my time and government funds.</review>

Very disappointing...

College shopping with my kiddio and took a trip here just while traveling...

It’s very dirty and does not seem to be kept up very well.

For an art school it seems like more of an afterthought than something in the forefront.☹️<//Text>

Attended for just over five semesters. Nice variety of courses to get certification or degrees in. A real nice college atmosphere with busy student body association. Some issues regarding the dispensing of financial aid. A nice Radio/TV program but no follow through regarding employment; terrible internships.</Text>

Lovely campus but not nearly enough way-finding. I ended up walking around for a long time and even dropped into to buildings to ask for directions. Even staff behind the front desk weren't able to give good directions.

If you are coming for a one-time event, as I was, be sure to get very good directions to the building your event will be in.</text>

This was my third college choice after my second college I applied to lost my application so I had to attend to this college instead. But it turned out great! My third semester was this Summer and I took a 6 week class. I took and passed American Sign Language and it was such a great experience and will definitely help me get a job or career! Many professors that I met here are wonderful, helpful, kind, and like family. I really recommend going here if you are looking for many different varieties of business classes and to take American Sign Language because other colleges doesn't provide those classes. Sadly, I am transferring to another college because I moved away and I can't continue the classes I taken this Fall 2017 Semester in my new college because they don't have those classes. :( But being a Viking will always be in my heart and part of journey. I had so much fun and learned so much and improved my skills from enrolling and studying in Long Beach City College! :)</Text>< rate>

I love it here. I was scared to start college, thinking that it was gonna be this big huge terrifying experience. But the teachers here and programs all help to make things easier.

Good facilities. Half the faculty are paid well, the other half are paid poverty wages (about $13,000 per year) with no benefits. The library's books are so out of date that it is basically useless except as a study space. If you work hard, you can transfer to a UC. If you are choosing between a UC and a community college but are worried about cost, go to the UC instead-- it's worth it.< /review>

I have all of my prerequisites for their nursing program yet nobody will evaluate my transcripts in order for me to apply to the program. They said transcripts cannot be evaluated until you have taken 12 credit hours. OK, fine. I looked up some classes that I can hurry and squeeze in to take 12 credit hours before the next application period and they seem to have a shortage of classes. It seems that even highly in demand classes such as Anatomy only have two classes each semester both of which are immediately full and have 80+ people on the waitlist. The only thing I can take away from my experience thus far is that going to this school is basically a luck of the draw, and pretty much impossible to transfer in if you have already attended another college. Its unfortunate. They seem to have great tuition prices, programs, and classes, but impossible to get in and start. Oh and no counselors available and nobody answering or returning phone calls.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>For any welders out there this is the best community college to take some welding courses. Materials are free and L.A city welding tests are administered for 35$ only. Cheaper than anywhere else I've even heard of.< /text>< UserId.>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>I used to love this campus when I started attending in 2011. But it seemed like the year I began at LBCC was the year everything started to change. They got rid of all the bunnies and I don't think they expected this to happen but the campus is now riddled with cats that crap and pee everywhere. Hold your breath as you walk past the P, N, M buildings because it's unbearable and unfortunately that's where the vending machines are.

I was lucky enough to get accepted and graduate from the VN program, but unfortunately the program put me over my units and I lost my priority registration status. I thought that was completely unfair and felt like I was being punished for completing the nursing program. It made it extremely difficult to continue taking prerequisites for the RN program. So difficult I am now taking classes at another community college.

School is impacted now, instructors are not as great as they used to be, class options are also very limited. Would I do it again, sure. I got a good education and was able to become a nurse. Do I think this school was once awesome and is now lackluster? Absolutely.

I think the worst part is when students have to go to different community colleges to take the classes they need. It would be amazing to start going to a community college, complete the program you need or transfer to a 4-year institution without having 4 different sets of transcripts to deal with. But I guess that dream is one from decades ago.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>STAY AWAY (especially if you are a transfer).  Their hours for classes make it impossible to have a decent schedule, NO ONE answers their phone, they are a few months behind with everything, and so much more.  I came from a university, and I have never been more stressed.  The entire staff are like chickens with their heads cut off and are unaware of what is going on.  No one is on the same page.  It's a joke and the biggest waste of a year.<//review>< Gmap_id>

LBCC a school in California, fyi in the same area wit Csulb. And this is not a perfect school but this is just like ANY city college campus such as El camino college or pcc and other places like that. But anyways I had a visit to campus ONLY ONCE and that changed the way that I looked at Long beach in a very good way because there were people of different backgrounds trying to still LEARN and FINISHING THEIR EDUCATION (insert SMILEY face emoji here). And for that I am VERY PROUD of CALI college systems and that includes U.S. college systems, THANKS to Mr.Pres. barack Obama.<//text>

I went to  LBCC about seven years, I recieved two AA degrees and several certificates. LBCC did for me what mental therapy couldn't, it taught me, i was able to be a child care worker for two years and a sub teacher for two years, i learned and improved and recovered from school, i love LBCC, I think the only way to save this world is to give everyone in the world a college education. ps all for free, thank god for the financial aid.

now i am looking for a job, if i had my way i would continue in school, but things are changed, i am  married plus other changes.

education is the best medicine.

Whole campus is dirty. Teachers don't care, neither do any of the higher ups. Morale is as low as it could be. Go ANYWHERE but here.</Review>

Terrible administration. You can never get into contact with anyone for help and if you do, they don't seem to even want to help you. Wait lists can go up to 100 people which is also ridiculous.< /Review>

<Time>1572754689828</Time><rate>5< /rate><review>Amazing! Exceeded expectations! So well organized and mapped out. Very clean, family friendly, and really incredible displays with some that are interactive. Great photo ops and really great music playing thru out. Only concern was that the fire dancers were kind of hard to see because the stage on only like a foot or two off ground and everyone is standing right up front. Other than that, great family experience!

This place was AMAZING!!! Literally transported you to an entire Halloween world with such awesome attention to details and really cool how each land had an entirely different aura to it. Would HIGHLY recommend for families with kids or just people who love Halloween and want a way to get in the holiday spirit.</Review>

I had a great time I loved the pumpkin spirit of fire performance and the real owl that they had. My favorite theme was the Chinese lantern area and seeing the pumpkin artists. I just wish they had more activities for children and adults. I would love to see more performances and an animal zoo would be awesome 🙂👍🙏<//review>

My family and I live 3.5 hours away and have family in SoCal. We wanted to take the kids to a Halloween festivity and decided to go to Pumpkin nights. First you have to pay $12 for parking and then $24 at the door. This did not make us happy at all. This is not a theme park! I would understand and come back if it was $15 at the door. Now, I am a Halloween enthusiast and was not happy that all the pumpkin displays were not real pumpkins. I do like the different themes they had throughout the park as well as games for the little ones. It would have been nice if the park provided a map of the displays. We did have fun though.< /text>

It wasn’t what I expected. I thought there would be more to it. Everything was all squished together which made it really hard to enjoy with out bumping into people. The isles were small, long lines to look at everything. They only had two regular small jumpers for all the kids there, the money I spent on the tickets would’ve much rather went to a nice pumpkin patch and enjoyed ourselves better unfortunately this was my first and last time at Pumpkin Nights.</Review>

It was way too crowded for the walkway they had... too many people were bumping into us and when we would try to take pictures, people would just be on the way. I don’t think I’ll be coming back to this place. It wasn’t really a “date night” place, it was more of a children’s pumpkin patch. I think the staff needs to be more organized and there needs to be a little more to do as well.< /Review>

Honestly it was alot of fun looking at all the beautiful carved pumpkins. I loved the way everything was split into different themes. They had a live owl which was amazing, his name is Archimedes. My biggest complaints would really be the lack of venders and maybe the price of the ticket. I still plan to come back again.<//review>

It was awesome! Saw the add on instagram. Bought tickets for 11 members of my family! Customer service was great, “Laura” was so helpful. It was very Family oriented. Super kid friendly! My kids loved it all, even my grandma is looking forward to next yr. Best night experience at a pumpkin patch. Even though my daughters didn’t get a pumpkin price for the token we all want to go again. Our favorite lands were the octopus under the sea with bubbles and the day of the dead land. I honestly can go on and on about how much we loved it and how much worth it was our long drive for such a great experience. See you next yr pumpkin nights or even sooner.< /Text>

<text>It was alright, went in with no expectations. Definitely not worth 20 dollars a person especially with the 12 dollar parking fee. The giant hot dog from one of the vendors is what kept me from leaving even earlier than expected.< /text><Resp>{'time': 1572239257403, 'text': 'Hi, Kris! Thanks for the feedback!

For 20bucks per person and 12 bucks parking for each car, you are getting ripoffed. The carve pumpkins are limited. If you like to take pictures and show the others you have a good life, go right ahead. Overpriced tickets and parking for fake people.< /text>

The carvings were impresive, it was all just a bit smaller than I was expecting (I imagine it's a perfect size for families with small kids). The Fire show & live owl were my favorite parts. The jellyfish area was my favorite theme. I would like to see more real pumpkins, most of the carvings there were fake ones. More shows & more night time animals would be awesome to see in the future.

Overall, it was fun & I'll probably go again. I'm just glad that I opted for the discounted weeknight tickets. It does seem like it's really meant for small kids & Instagram photo enthusiasts. Still, it's nice to have a Halloween option that isn't gorey.</review>

<Review>The pumpkins were the best part, but would never attend again, as way too pricey. Carnival area was VERY small. I paid over $80 for 5 tickets, along with $12 for parking. From the advertisement, I thought there would be a lot of entertainment, yet they only had the fire show, which we did not get to see. I heard it was great when it was at a different venue a couple of years ago., and much cheaper What a disappointment!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

It was a good night. So much people tho, be prepared to stand in lines for a long time if you want to take pictures with the main displays. Kids where getting antsy standing around so that didnt go well. We also didnt stop at "monster mash" (the kids playground) because it was way too crowded, I felt like my kids where going to get hurt. The bouncy houses too, the other children where basically pulling them down and it was a real safety concern. I was disappointed that the pumpkins weren't real. But they where cute anyways. Honestly I dont think I will come back, I rather spend the money on another pumpkin/Halloween related event. It was nice to get to know it tho. Took out my curiosity about it.< /text>

Just leaving this place. Here on the last night of the festival. Lots of folks. Many kids. Lots of walking. Hundreds of colorful lights.  If you get tired, you can sit and watch Disney's Coco in an open air theatre. Very nice. Bundle of fun.< /text>

My daughter is in a wheel chair and we didn't know there were a lot of small but steep up hill and steep down slopes. Some parts of the paths were filled with dirt so we had a hard time pushing her wheel chair. So if you are on a wheel chair be ready to put in some muscle.  Most of the port a potty's didn't have toilet paper but there is better restrooms in the back side where pumpkins are. I didn't like that they had a time share and they try to pull you in to buy time shares so beware.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1571157026037, 'text': 'Hi, Gloria!

<Text>Had a great time with my family. I bought tickets for family of 8 about a week ago, and then after reading so many bad reviews I was afraid of the disappointment and embarrassed of what my family was going to say about an event I said looked great. But we experienced it ourselves and it was amazing.  The pumpkin mazes were so colorful and detailed and we enjoyed it all. We were not in a rush so we took out time to enjoy it and for pictures.  There was many food stands, 2 jumpers for free, horse ride $7 lap, see saws, tether ball, and a sand box were kids find a coin to redeem a prize. I think it was a great experience for a family night!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Very disappointing. I was expecting real pumpkins carved in beautiful designs like I've seen in other shows. The only real pumpkins they have aren't carved at all, or you see about 5-6 carved at the artist table. The rest of the fake pumpkins are cookie cutter designs. Nothing impressive. If I had known, I wouldn't have spent so much on tickets and parking to go. The food court was pretty lack luster as well. This show is really for those much wanted Instagram selfies and little kids.< /review>

All foam pumpkins with the same faces. No real carved pumpkins. Just a money pit. Setup for social media pictures.< /Review>

If I could get a refund, I would. It smelled so bad, we had to leave. I don't know if it was the trash or rotting pumpkins. Either way it was so busy, even on a Thursday we couldn't really take pictures.<//Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>0 stars, but I had to put at least 1 star for the Los Angeles location.  Believe me, I wanted to enjoy this event & if I love it, I'd take the time to say so as well.  I don't know which was worse, this event or last year's Rise of the Jack O'Lanterns.  Shockingly, I'll say last year's event had more to see, but both were very underwhelming and disappointing.  Kids will like this, but adults will be very underwhelmed and bored once again like last year.

The company's website portrayed the event to be one of the most fabulous, memorable fall events of the year...NOT!  I saw NO fire-breathing dancers, no food trucks, and the pumpkins were the plastic types you can get at the 99 Cent Store and the actual hand-carved real ones were just a couple tucked away with the two carvers in a not very viewable area.  The little food that was there was some stale-looking cookies and brownies.  My fiance' & I hadn't eaten all day so as to save our appetites, only to be extremely let down with the food too.  We headed somewhere else right after to get food.  We also had to change dates, so, unfortunately, that grand total I paid included another $10 date-change fee.  I don't normally complain & if something is fabulous, I'll take the time to say so.

So I paid a total of $72.82 for two people to be there for exactly 15 minutes.  For not much more, I could have gone to Knott's Berry Farm!  Apparently, the dancers, food trucks, etc. were only there during certain parts of the night.  And I would have stayed longer if there was information on the website or signs at the place of when the dancers, trucks, etc. would be happening.  So now ALL the 5:00, 5:30, 6:00, and maybe 6:30 and maybe certain later time attendees completely missed the entertainment, yet they're charging the same price to everyone.  They need to announce on the website or have signs like at amusement parks that say the showtimes for dancers are at (6:45, 8:00, and 9:30 for example).  Another unfair thing is that someone else who wrote a review here said (the normally $12) parking was free on the night they went.  Why did they get free parking? Very overpriced and hyped up for nothing.

I tried to get some kind of refund, but without success.<//review><date>1541449322064</date><user_name>behsci<//user_name><Resp>{'time': 1541481239355, 'text': "Thanks for the review!

Tried to purchase tickets online for the weekend; nowhere on the website does it say that tickets sell out, just that tickets must be purchased online Fri-Sun.

Well, lo and behold, tickets are sold out for this weekend and the next.

If it would've listed that tickets are "LIMITED SUPPLY, RESERVE NOW" we would've bought them when we first came upon this event.

Next time: list a damn head's up.</Text>

The pumpkins are not real carved pumpkins. They are plastic. It's not 8 mazes. It's 1 continuous one with different themes . Everything was covered in deep mud from the rain. It was very disappointing.< /Review>

Great experience and service. I wanted to gift a custom printed pair of tshirt for my best buddy's birthday and this place is where to be. They printed my custom design within 30 minutes with full satisfaction. I can't think of any better place than this<//Text>

Very fast and polite I do think they should lower down their price a bit to pricey just for something to be printed on in less then 3 to 4 minutes my shirt cost 35< /Text>

A friend recommended me this over the shop i used to go to and man the prices are so less i could have saved a lot if i had come here earlier. The print was excellent and the best part is that it's all done so quick in minutes!

<review>This is my 3rd year of  making a custom t shirt for my wifey.
I still remember that day when i came across this kiosk beside footlocker while going to the food court .That  tall guy, i dont  remember his name i told him about the surprise i want to give   Written as " Will You Marry me" he made it so perfect , wearing that t shirt i proposed her .  Good quality of printing , reasonable price . Always reminds me the proposal day.Still i have those two T shirt  from past two years , which looks like as if   i bought today. Thanks for the quality you guys maintai< /review><Name>raheem abdul< /Name><Response>{'time': 1505580725145, 'text': 'Thanks for your feedback'}< /Response>< gmap_id>

No comment... They may send more of their "night stalkers" to terrorize me, although I quit going to church there over 20 years ago... (when I moved back to the South Bay, which is where I was originally from). I'm not sure who their Pastor is now, but he should do something about their Church stalkers.< /Review>

<Text>Should have left years sooner
Wish Mr O the best sounds the self absorbed witchhunting that goes on with the membership. Really like Pederson and Ms Cannon's presentation..
. I was told i wasn't invited to a singles tea party
Told by someone else no one liked me and to take the hint by a volunteer. I caught doing the naughty in parking lot

I hitched a ride with someone to San Francisco and she told me to sit in back she didn't want to be seen with me I thought it was me but turns OUT it was them .Found two other churches that are pure  magic in south bay.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Good people with a great history as a very strong congregation of the Presbyterian Church. Strong heart for outreach to the community and around the world. It is currently launching satellite campuses through the San Francisco Bay Area.

<Review>This is an awesome church. Incredibly welcoming. Wonderful worship music. Very inspiring messages each weekend. Senior Pastor John Ortberg is an extremely compelling disciple of Christ. It's a deep bench at Menlo with many wonderful pastors. And with so many wonderful programs. Sunday is my favorite day! Menlo Church is true to its tagline: Everybody's Welcome, Nobody's Perfect, Anything's Possible.<//Review><response>None<//response><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>(update: better 2nd time) My first time at the famous Menlo Church led by Pastor John ortberg ...and it was a mixed bag... the sermon was good about women ...most of the people were generally nice,  but the lady who sat next to me squeezed  getting in and then told me she had the flu (and she sat closer to me then to her friend on the other side that was strange , plus she literally typed on her phone the entire time , even during the prayer) and then as I was leaving a  black lady gave me a angry look as if to say 'what am u doing here' ,; that was strange too...there weren't   that many black people there, but the one person w/ black skin color that I did encounter didn't seem to like me ...even tho I never knew her, never met her , didn't talk to her ...just walked past her...(is that racism?) ...( but I know by now that some people go to church, sadly, with a personal agenda that is not always Biblical & there's not much the church can do about it...when it is done manipulatively & subtle ) but I'll give it a second chance... thank you for the good sermon ....and most of you for being hospitable fellow Christians . God bless you all. John BA/BA/M.Div< /Text><user_id>104398099469476310029</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Pastor Ortberg: I wonder what are the TRUE motives for the brutal , unfounded attack on my pastor, Bill Hybels - Willow Creek Community Church. I pray you and your wife cease trying to mislead good Christians  with falsehoods. May you both hear the word of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ and follow Him, alone.</text>

<Review>My wife and I visited Menlo Park one Sunday when we happened to be in the bay area (we live in the central valley, but if we could we would attend here!).  This is a church where a lot of good things are happening!  We attended both a contemporary and traditional service, and both were outstanding.  We went to the main church, but there are apparently a variety of options, depending upon your preference. Music was awesome.  This is a big church building, but strategically placed screens made it so everyone has a good view of what is going on. John Ortberg was preaching when we came, and you will have to search far and wide to find another who will compare with this speaker.  Ortberg is articulate and inspiring. Following the service he prayed for us and a number of other individuals that came forward after the service.  He is not only a gifted speaker but author of a number of best selling books.

There is a lot going on here with children's ministries for families with children.   People were friendly and accepting.  The director of small groups and a number of other ministries greeted us and spent quite a while talking with us, explaining the various ministries of the church.  If you are from the bay area you have the wonderful opportunity to grow in the influence of this wonderful church body.  If not, you will have to content yourself with watching their sermons online as I do.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>What an organisation!  We are visiting from England and from the minute we drove into the car park and found a 'first-time guest' space we felt cared for.  We were met by Linda, who showed us the best place to sit (my daughter has autism and doesn't generally 'do' church), we appreciated the sung worship - understated, professional band, the testimony, the sermon with visuals on screen - and the lemonade & doughnuts after the service!

Thank you for all you're doing - God bless your extraordinary ministry and...see you tomorrow!</text>< userid>

<text>The perfect store for party planners!  Dollar Tree is famous for Dollar Deals but if you are planning a party this is the store for you. They have a very large selection of party items like napkins, hats, streamers, cards, wrapping paper, glasses, cups, tablecloths, balloons and more. if you are a bargain hunter Dollar Tree Never Let You Down. A good tip is to make sure you look at expiration dates and for dented items when shopping for food but you will always get your dollars worth here.  The Dollar Tree in Indio California is very clean and well-staffed. I shop there early in the morning and never have to wait very long at the checkout. This is the place to get great greeting cards as well. They have a very large selection and most items are  two for a dollar.  I can't really recommend buying kitchen supplies here except for garbage bags, Ziploc bags and items like foil. These are great deals to get at the Dollar Tree. They do not have a big variety of fresh food items but you can buy great spices and canned goods at low prices.</text>< user_name>

Good exceptthe bathroom.found razor blade inches away from my baby. Floor dirty. Trash overflowing. Smelled worse than port potty. Toilet looked liked it hadnt been cleaned in months. I understand its a dollar tree but i expect bathrooms to b cleaned n not have razor blades where a child could get hurt< /review>

<Text>None of these reviews are actually for the museum (they are for the campground). The museum is AWESOME.  It has limited hours, but if you can make the 3.1+ mile 1,300 foot uphill hike it's worth it!! It's in the big white building with the Visitor Information sign. Lots of cool nature displays and old pictures.<//Text>< pics>

Five star view of LA. Lots of campsites in the trees. Indoor visitor center. Easy hike up. Picnic tables, grills and free firewood. What's not to love?!< /Text>

Beautiful place to camp , to get up can be a bit challenging but so worth it. Bathrooms are clean ,free wood and internet as well . Free camping just need to get a permit and that u will be able to get it in the visitor center once u get to the top .</Text>

Excellent workout. Straight up the fire service road for about 3 miles. Best to go early before the sun comes out strong since the road is fully exposed and has very little shade. Take plenty of water because it is not available once you get there. Keep in mind a 90 degree will sap your energy and hydration is a must. It takes about an hour to get up to Henninger Flats give or take a few minutes.</review>

Being on the lower end, just inside the Angeles Forest, you'll never be fully secluded here. These trails are very populated & on top on that very well maintained. Feeling the air shift cooler as you curve up, dipping into the pocket of the mountain.< /Review>

<Text>It's a great place to hike to from Eaton Canyon... If you're NEW pay attention! There is a "contributor" Tatiana Lopez that appears to have uploaded 2500+ photos and tagged them as being taken at Henninger Flats. They are NOT properly tagged... and I've exhausted reported as many as I can... but it will take forever! So just ignore her photos... there is a very obvious difference in her photos verses what others have posted/tagged.

For those Hiking up from Eaton Canyon... it is a challenging elevation climb, but an easy hike as the trail is quite clear and wide. The trail is the "fire road" that leads up to Henninger (which was repaired a number of years ago after a landslide took out large portions of the road (and mountain side)... I'm glad it was reopened... and for those wanting a big challenge you can continue up to Mt. Wilson if you're feeling bold!

Remember to "leave no trace" and keep your 10 essentials with you. This is still wild country with spiders, snakes, bears and mountain lions in the area. So please, don't treat your hike as if you're going to Tom Sawyer Island and Disneyland. You can get hurt if you're not being safe. People have fallen from ledges and been hurt (a few killed) so treat nature with respect and stay firmly on the trails.

<review>Aside from the lack of running water, the camp is pretty great. Plenty of spots, and three levels of camp to choose from. Its about a 3 mile hike up, we took the walnut trail from eaton canyon (med difficulty to Mt. Wilson toll rd, then easy). Free firewood, and is patrolled by the local fire department frequently.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2dd2201383f4b:0x21496be732eb4eb3<//Gmap_id></record>

This lovely campground is the border between the more commonly hiked lower part of the Toll Road and the more remote trail leading up to My. Wilson.  There is presently no potable water, but plans are being made to add some. Above this point, things keep getting better and better.<//Text>

No drinkable water was available, so I had to backpack two gallons for my campsite, in addition to all of the other camping equipment. Quiet and peaceful, even though you're not too far from the city.</Text>

< Review>
In May I made the move from Seattle to Los Angeles and it didn’t take long for me to start itching to get outdoors and explore. Unfortunately it took me a couple weeks to settle in and finally make time to get out. I started doing some research on recommended places to camp near LA and Henniger Flats was at the top of almost everyone’s list that I could find online. A short hike, free camping and not far from where I live; sold. Especially for my first camping adventure since making the move to sunny California.

Henniger Flats is located in the San Gabriel Mountains near Altadena, California. Directions on getting there are pretty simple coming from downtown LA.

The trailhead to Henniger Flats is located off N Altadena Drive. It’s not easy to spot but if you’re familiar with the area, you’ll probably have no problem finding it. If you’re heading to Henniger Flats for the night, you’ll have to pay attention to where you park because there’s not a lot of overnight or long-term parking at the trailhead. I personally parked down the street on N Altadena in the neighborhood. Just keep an eye out for parking signs and you’ll probably be ok.

When you reach the trailhead you’ll see a sign that reads, “The Henniger Flats Project.” You have to hike up  Mount Wilson Toll Road to get there. Initially it’s a little confusing to figure out which trail you need to be on to get there, at least it was for me. You’ll walk down the beginning of the trail and cross the white bridge. Once you cross the white bridge, stay to the left and head up until you reach Henniger Flats. It’s about a 3 mile hike and the incline gets steep at times. There are plenty of benches to rest at on the way up.

There’s no shade on the way up so it’s important to start your hike early if you intend on camping and have a heavy pack. Also bring an abundance of water. There is a visitor center and museum at Henniger Flats, but there’s no running water. Be prepared! I didn’t run into any wildlife and you probably won’t either since the trail is very popular and there seems to be a lot of foot traffic throughout the day. There are a few signs for rattlesnakes but I didn’t run into any.

After your 3 mile journey to the top, you’ve reached Henniger Flats. First thing’s first, you need to find the onsite LACFD Forester that’s on duty to check in. I read that you’ll be given a permit for camping and to use a stove, but I didn’t have to do that when I checked in for whatever reason. There was a cub scout clan doing some work at the campgrounds so I’m sure he was busy and distracted. After or even before you check in, you can check out the visitor center and museum to learn about Henniger Flats and the surrounding areas. It’s pretty neat.

Once you get checked in you’ll have to find your camping lot. There are 3 levels of camping at Henniger Flats. There’s a lower level campground near the visitor center and museum. It seemed pretty busy, so I walked to the upper and Fiji campgrounds. The forester actually recommended the Fiji campground area for a quieter environment and great place for setting up hammocks. He was absolutely right and if you’re looking for a quiet place to chillax, Fiji is the way to go.

Most larger camping lots have picnic tables and stoves to cook on. It’s worth noting there are about 15-20 camping lots in the upper and lower campgrounds. Fiji only has 3 camping lots, so you have to get there early to snag one. You can also call the forester head of time to get some insight on open camp lots. There’s plenty of shade once you get settled and the campgrounds are very well kept. There was no trash, the trails were well maintained and the views are phenomenal. There’s plenty of trails to check out after you get settled in.

Overall I had a great experience camping at Henniger Flats and I will certainly go again. #LosAngeles #Hiking #Outdoors<//Review>

They have grills to cook in and make fires inside. No fires allowed outside of the grills. Free firewood is also available but water is not currently running.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><UserId.>104765317142472449207<//UserId.><name>Daniel Suh< /name><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

<Review>It's a 6-mile hike, up and back, from Eaton Canyon Nature Center — park for free! — at the end of which you'll have exercised (better health), left your troubles behind (better attitude) and given yourself peace of mind (better spiritual state). It's win-win-win-win! Make the time, and the world will be a better place.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This is an awesome reward for a steep slanted hike/walk up above the Eaton canyon wash. With breath taking views and a campground, you can't help but just take it all in. There are various benches posted at all of the best Vista spots on your way up in case you need a breather or to get pebbles out of your shoes. It is an all packed dirt hike-walk so be sure to have some grippy shoes on. also at the top, there are restrooms and an old timey outhouse. Plus a museum with actual watch towers and other vintage items to check out. We also saw some HUGE silver squirrels!</Text>

We hiked from Pinecrest Street to the top of Henninger Flats. It's about 3 miles each way and 1350 elevation gain. Not too hard but no shade.<//text>

My review is for the hike leading up to the campground from eaton canyon. It's a beautiful hike with spectacular views. Finally you are rewarded with an amazing view of the pasadena area and on clear days all of los angeles.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Be careful, the last time I had a very bad experience, with the subject hiding in the bushes I was taking pictures.
You do not know what kind of people you can find in those places since there is no guard to watch the perimeter

Tengan cuidado, la última vez tuve una muy mala experiencia,  con sujeto que se escondía entre los arbustos  me estaba tomando fotos .
Uno no sabe que tipo de personas se puede encontrar en  esos lugares ya que no hay ningún guardia que vigile el perímetro<//text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><Text>Very friendly staff and its so much to see and smell. I purchased scents for my house and my car. This place is entoxicating to all your eyes and nose. So much to see you almost forget what smells you came for. They have gotten much better with the candle promos good job. I like how you can get multi items for 1 price and still feel like a winner. Stop by the store you will definitely want to grab something that smells good and makes you smile. Don't forget to write down any previous scents you like. Trust me you might want new smells that bring winter indoors but in a good way. Go see what they have everybody can use a pick me up these days. Why not excite your senses with your favorite candles, hand soaps, body wash, the list goes on. Go forth and shop for your favorite items that make you 😃 🙂< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The place smells nice and is huge. I asked around for womanly advice since I am a derp at these olaces.

<rate>3<//rate><review>For a small store its jam packed with products. I came for a money order And it was only  $.75 compared to the $10.00 Wells Fargo (my own bank) charges.
The clerk was very cordial, I'm sure with the area this store is in, they put up with more than their share of BS from some of the mentally ill street people and low lifes so it was nice to see a smiling face. It does appear they cater to the Hispanic community by the signage and international products.
Will stop by again when I have more time to look.< /review>< userid>

It took way over an hour at recycling there were 2 men working and they where handicap and very slow and not very nice kinda rude because they had a line of costumer this was my second time to attempt to turn my recycling in there was a huge line so I left and came back and there still was a line it took way over an hour the young man who normally works there by himself is very fast and gets it done and has very good costumers service skills those 2 men have no business do this kinda of job if they can't do at a steady pace there was 2 of them and they still could not get that line done it was extremely hot out and I've never had to wait that long...very disappointed with how I was treated and I understand that they need a job but that job not for them I'm just saying and am judging anyone but that job is kinda fast pace and if 2 men can't keep up when one young man dose it by himself then there something wrong...</Review>

<review>You can never be sure what they will charge. Every 3 months I collect my household waste in 4 containers in my pickup with the addition area filled to top of bed. The price has varied from $19 to a ripoff of $37. Don't try to dispute the price!</review>< Pics>

The staff people were rude and indifferent and the price has more than doubled since I was there about a month ago.  The hazardous waste staff were untrained and also indifferent.  The operation was horribly inefficient.  I wanted to recycle about 1/2 of my pickup load as steel and aluminum, but they have made the operation so bad, I would have been behind about a dozen trucks lined up to try to dump yard waste, so I just gave up and dumped it all in the waste tipping station.</Text>

Staff are helpful. The only issue is that there is almost always a line of cars waiting to get in, which is understandable: they can’t let everyone in at once otherwise not enough room to park the car before unloading. They accept lithium ion batteries, paint, and etc.</Review>

Ordered a dumpster for a clean out 450.00 for 7 days......their delivery was 7:00am to 6:00pm. Could not would not even give me a before noon or after 12 time frame.  What does that tell you about their drivers and their schedules who should know how long it will take to drop off a dumpster 3 miles away go back to the yard and get another dumpster to make another drop...best advice call around their are other options.< /review>

I wanted a small dumpster to clean out a shed and garage. They will charge almost $170 for the smallest one and will deliver it some time at THEIR convenience any time between 6 am and 6 pm.  No call before they come and I can't wait around for 12 hours to make sure they put it in the right spot so they do not block my garage.  They have no concept of customer service!< /Text>

<review>When is recycle day in Diamond Springs Mobile Home Park?  It's Wednesday the 10th. I thought it was today. My Recycle is still full on the curb along with other residents. Being this is a Mobile Home Park we don't get schedules. Instead we act like cows if one puts it out there blah blah blah<//review>< Pictures>

They take care of you on the inside but I sat on hold for almost 30 minutes and I ended up just hanging up. Work on that El Dorado Disposal.<//review>

Love the gal that checks you in. Cracking jokes and being fun. Who would have thought I would have a friendly experience at the dump.
Unloading was easy, back in and toss your rubbish in the pile. Heavy equipment and human labor was actively keeping the area clear.
Disposal for e-Waste, batteries and more.</Review>

<date>1549732900479<//date><text>The staff seems nice and helpful but this past week the green driver drove right past my house and didn't pick the green waste. I called immediately but did he come back? NO. I fill my can every week, I need it picked up as scheduled and the response is I could fill 5 bags next time  and drag them out to the street which is actually really hard for me and of course I  have to call them first or they won't pick them up.
We moved all over California with my husbands work the past 20 years and this is the only county we've experienced that only picks up green and recycle every other week. When I mentioned that their response was I could get more cans. So if you ever wonder why there's garbage can everywhere wonder no more.
Considering we're an EXTREMELY HIGH FIRE AREA you'd think the very least this county trash pick up could do is to pick up ALL trash every week, not every other week. The County should insist for better  services from this company.</text><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<Review>I am legally disabled.  Today was recycle day.  My daughter had bought a 6 foot tall mirror for me and it arrived in the appropriate flat frame type box. I am also a recovering cancer patient and have no grip and arm strength because of treatment. I slid the box out for recycle and they left it with a note telling me to break it down before they would take it. I can't and it was already a frame type box that was less than 4 inches deep at its edge. Anyone with grip ability could have bent it without any effort.  I don't know what to do now. It will sit on my driveway till someone comes to visit and can fold it in half so it will satisfy the company.< /Review>< pics>

<text>I use this place weekly and I have the same size trailer with the exact same amount of garbage and these stupid people charge me a different price every time. Today my load was smaller than normal so I only brought 20$ and the total came to 20.95$ and the girl at the gate would not let me in. Very upset.

Too Damn expensive. They charged my $92 to drop off one pick up truck load of dirt! It's dirt! I now see why people dump stuff on the side of the road. The prices are ridiculous. There's always a huge line to wait in and they don't offer any assistance unloading. Every time I go I end up helping a senior unload their waste. Take your stuff to the keifer landfill in sac for less than half the price of what the Placerville transfer station charges.< /Review>

the MRF facility seemed to  be disorganised--had only one clerk trying to process the  trucks going in on one side and the residential customers on the other side of the kiosk, so it took about 5 minutes per car.<//review>

Had the French Pot Roast.  Looked and tasted like the brown gravy sat for awhile because it tasted pretty salty and, was thick and dark in color.  I don't think that I will be ordering this again.  On the bright side, my friend enjoyed the French dip sandwich.<//review>

Ordered my first Thanksgiving Feast. Tried the pecan pie tonight. Great! It was very well packaged. A little surprised with the teeny tiny package of fried onion rings for the big green bean casserole.  The teeny tiny nuts for the sweet potatoes.<//Review>

Extremely disappointed by every aspect of this restaurant. The restaurant was empty and we were sat immediately. The waitress did not come back for 15 minutes to get our drink order and to deliver our waters took another 15 minutes.  We ordered when she brought our waters and the food presentation was spot on (I will give the cooks that! But the food was terrible. The potatoes were raw and my daughters French toast was batter in the middle). The food was obviously sitting waiting for a long time because it was cold, not even warm when it hit our table. We had a baby and had to ask for a high chair which took her until our food was served to bring. It was filthy and I had to go to my car to get sanitizer and cleaner. The picture is my 3rd napkin cleaning it. There was food on it... you'd think during a pandemic they would keep things cleaner. I hate to be a downer and love leaving 5 stars but this is not a place you want to go.< /review>

Very displeased with how my May 9, 2021, catering order was handled.  After calling several locations, I was assured by Evan at the Tustin restaurant that they would be able to accommodate my Hot Brunch Feast in the small size.  I had asked to pick it up at 12:30, but Evan advised that it would be busier at that time and asked if I could pick up my order at 11:30 instead.  I was happy to oblige since he agreed to prepare my order during one of their busiest days, Mother’s Day.   I called again on Saturday, to confirm they would still be able to prepare my food on Sunday and was told again yes by Evan.  On Sunday, my son and I arrived at 11:45, to give them a chance to complete the order in case they were running behind.  When we made it to the To Go counter, the young woman behind the counter mentioned that our food would not be ready for another 30 minutes and asked if we wanted to pay ahead of time. She proceeded to ring me up for a total of $40 some odd dollars.  I advised her that the Mimi’s website, lists the small Hot Brunch Feast at $90.  She then appeared confused and asked what it was that I ordered, so I repeated that it was the Hot Brunch Feast.  She did not know what this meal was and went to find a menu, I’m guessing to confirm the price?  After some time, she returned with the menu and rung me up for the correct amount.  She told me that someone would bring our order out to my car and asked for a description of my car.  By 12:55, no one had delivered our order, so my son and I went back in to check on the status.  There was a different young woman at the counter.  I showed her my receipt and asked when my order would be ready.  She said it was being prepared because she saw her colleague placing catering trays into a bag and started to help another customer.  Those items were left on the counter unattended, so I went to check if that was my food, which it wasn’t.  A few minutes later, another colleague FINALLY brought out our order.  I don’t recall any apology from the last employee we dealt with, perhaps because she was unaware of how long our wait had become?  I also question, why Evan recommended an 11:30 a.m. pick up time instead of agreeing to my original 12:30 time? I also don’t understand why he did not take down my phone number to call with any problems, such as their staff running behind schedule, which I would have understood because of Mother’s Day. Why too, was the first staff member not familiar enough with their menu items?  Very poorly run location, to which I will never return.<//Text>

<review>Very nice ambience and service. Not a long wait for a Wednesday morning. Their portion sizes are quite big. I tried their egg white omelet and waffles, cappuccino and muffins.

Highly recommend the cappuccino, it was phenomenal. The upside down pineapple muffin (seasonal special) was also quite nice.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRWeNk_3J7PktlmMRFgnHFvf9GEYim2kvD-Wcl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgFAJlKeB9nl_IX40t2bfp6yiBzLtGldGSf66F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Thiswas the first time we had eaten inside a restaurant since March, 2020.  It was after 3 PM and we each ordered an entree.  The coastal linguine was a bit too garlicky for me.  Husband ordered roast beef atop mashed potatoes.  He originally was going to order the coastal linguine so when I suggested swapping, he readily agreed.  We enjoyed both entrees although we both agreed to ask for light garlic on the linguine if we were to order it again.  As is our custom, we ordered one dessert and 2 spoons.  It was the pumpkin creme brulee.  Sadly it wasn't quite up to par.  We would have enjoyed a stronger pumpkin flavor.  It was more like a pudding, with no whipped cream.  The staff was attentive...personable and very friendly.  The restaurant was one of the older ones but simply decorated and very clean (which is probably the most important attribute in today's world!)  Would we dine there again?  Yes we would.</text>< pictures>

Great service and tasty food. The waitress even helped us optimize the price of our order by leveraging adds on to other entrees.</Review>

<Text>Great food. Great service. Beef Pot Roast with potatoes au gratin and green beans cooked perfectly. Fork tender beef, green beans with a touch of crunch and creamy au gratin were outstanding. My wife can't get enough 🦃. As the beef is my go to plate at Mimi's, the roast turkey is hers. With dressing and two side and an ample serving of bird she always has leftovers for the next day.
We had a bad experience at another location (Long Beach) using a test menu with limited selections and a terrible au gratin, we were pleased to see familiar favorites on the menu in Tustin.

Worst experience ever, burned or uncooked food it took almost two hours and almost every plate had an issues and when they gave us dirty drinking glasses, we left, not before someone unapologetically spilled hot coffee on one of us. Go literally anywhere else< /Text>

I placed an order online through their website for pick up. Paid online, got a confirmation email. When I arrived to pick up the order, they said they never recieved it. So they take your money, confirm the order via email and then it goes into the trash I guess. Probably never coming back.</Text>

I placed a phone order and waited on line to find out that it was not put through.  The cashier took a new one and put a rush on it, promised it would be ready in about 10 minutes.  To their credit it was more about 5. So that made things better. The food was great! Only giving 4 stars because of the order mishap.<//review>

I love Mimi’s eggs Benedict. I ordered them today along with 6 bran muffins for my husband to be picked up. I ordered at 8:06 am and arrived at Mimi’s at 8:15.  I saw the muffins on the counter.  I waited along with two other groups for 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us! The two groups were seated and I still had to announce that I was waiting for service! Once I was acknowledged it still took a few minutes to get the food. I was told when I ordered at 8:06 that my order would be ready in 10-15 minutes and it ended up taking 21 minutes. My food was hot and delicious but the wait and service was not. Barely an apology was made.</text>

Poor service, poor food. I use to love this chain. I always knew that the food, at worst would be good, and sometimes there would be something truly outstanding being served. I am hoping that it was just this particular location that was so below my expectations.</Text>

This particular Mimi's provided us a delightful experience and reminded us of the Mimi's we remembered from the past.  A freshened menu with good food, excellent service, and generous portions.  We took a 4 pack of muffins home and enjoyed them the following morning.  Time to give them a try again!<//review>

They serve complimentary bread with butter so yummy. We ordered jambalaya with pasta, I enjoy spicy food. We also had a burger. Ice cream. All good food good quality good service. Great place. Price ranges from 10 bucks a plate and up. Not bad.< /Text><response>None<//response>< Pictures>

< review>
We used to go to Mimi's Cafe quite often,  however, lately both the food and the service have been going downhill.  Today was pretty much the last straw.  The menu has changed,   and the service is not as friendly as it was in the past. The kicker, though, is that everyone at my table didn't like any of the food we ordered.  To the point where we left Mimi's (after paying,  of course) and picked up some fast food - which was much better.  Sad to say,  I will probably not be going back to Mimi's.< /review>

Just stopped in for coffee with 2 friend, we needed to discus something.Service was fine. There is only so much you can do with 3 cups of coffee.
Frequent MiMi's often. Kind of do it in spurts. All's well. Been a customer since you took the place of Manny's.😊<//text>

Found hair in my food. This rating is for this occurrence. Manager never came as promised?  Waiter was very apologetic. Other visits have been good.< /review>

<Text>If you come here, get a muffin. They are fluffy and warm. It's the perfect place for a family of group because of the cat of food (American, French and Mexican). What I don't like is that they seem to have discontinued their Chipotle sauce which I always paired with my omelettes.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dcda2ac640a1db:0x773ab07675374918</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The food was really good and portions were just right. We had a group party with only one waitress. She did an amazing job and there wasn't a single complaint from anyone in the bunch.  I would definitely recommend this place for a couple or a crowd. See you there.< /review>

Before they used to give you a basket of bread with small bread rolls,  now they slice like one bread roll in 4 pieces so that sucks. I got mushroom pasta and it wasnt that good however the salads my brother and mother had were good.<//text>

I went once with a large group of people after a group meeting. The servers were especially great though in breaking up the table into almost 12 different bills/orders with no problem. The food was a bit better than I would've expected as well.<//Review>

The food was very good. After a while the server never checked on us. Nor did any other server. I had to call out to a server to ask for my check. Our server did not come to the table to pick it up. I had to take it up front on my way out. Our server blew his tip  big time.<//text>

First off I would like to say the service was great. And, I don't think you can beat Mimi's muffins anywhere. However, I took my son there for breakfast today. The coffee was not good. He had a cappuccino that was pretty good. He had a breakfast burrito plate and I have the ham and cheese crepe. The food was mediocre at best. And, mine was only lukewarm. I had not been to Mimi's in a long while. It seems to me, based on today's experience, the quality of the food is decreasing. I don't think I'll be going back. At the cost of $37 for two people for breakfast it was not a good value.<//text>

Finally!!!
I am so happy!  Mimi's on 17th. in Santa Ana hired a cook that understands and would fulfill my simple requests:
bacon "cracker crispy" potatoes well done, and a kind server who served me with a smile plus being able to sit inside.
Yes!< /Text>

<Name>Chris Donabedian</Name><Review>We went for dinner.    I had a few croissants... amazingly done!  The pasta was ok.... chicken parmesan..... it was ok... chicken wasn't the most amazing quality... much room for improvement.    Pasta was decent.    Service was very good.   Don't sit near windows on the cooler days... they are old and drafty.    ....it's time for the owner to replace them,  I'm guessing too cheap:(    I digress...  ....it's good.< /Review>< Pics>

Have been doing Thanksgiving dinner at Mimi's for years and always very happy about the meal and service. This was the first year they let me down. Soup was cold and the dark meat turkey came shredded, small portion and not one solid piece of meat.< /Text>

Don't go here unless you like bad food and bad service. Came here with my family they had us wait 20min to seat us I'm not sure why because there was a lot of open seating inside they seat us in the patio area this dark grimy place and as soon a s they hand us the menu ask us what we'd like to order so we have to rush and order because the waiter was impatient then we wait for our food it gets here and its like cafeteria food slapped on a plate greasy and gross I tried eating it but honestly it was bad greasy and extremely overpriced got two meals and one kids meal total ends up being 48$ wasn't like we ordered steak or anything it was an omelet and some french toast....what a dissapointment</review>

< Review>
I ordered the steak and eggs. To begin with the service was great and Cristi was the bomb. Reason i say this is because, i had a situation with my dinner plate. I advised Cristi of my situation and she apologized and cleared our table. But to my amazement she immidiately escalated my concern. The manager came over and apologized personal and asked if i would like anything to replace my meal, i said no thank you. When we asked for the check, the manager had discounted my meal off the check. Yes, i had a situation with my meal but it was quickly handled by Marissa. That left me with a good feeling and i would definitely come back and recommend Mimi's to everyone. Simply on the fact that they approciate my being a customer.<//Review>

Having a early breakfast on Friday morning before Fontana's NASCAR events this past weekend, I was incredibly impressed. Having been loyal to this restaurant in past for years, was ready to give it up. Why? Overall menu was extensively with 'unhealthy' dishes as if was still Dean Evans owned and operated. Asked the waiter Javier, whom was fabulous as a server to request the cook to minimize as much as possible the oil/grease used to 'fry' their breakfast potato's. He sated that he would attempt. Voila, great potatoes as Mimi's is branded in servings, was terrific. Without oil at ALL! So so good. Complimented the Great General Manager Chris on the order request outcome. He shared with me that Mimi's was owned now by a large Global entity and had more healthy training in the cooking/recipes. Finally</text>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>The food was okay, but the service was terrible. We had to wait 10 minutes to get our menus, after getting up and asking for our menus twice (once asking the manager). Then our server didn't bring us enough waters for the table. He then brought out two wrong dinners, and I had to wait for half the meal to get my actual dinner. And our creme brulee was sub par (it didn't have a crust at all).</Review>< pictures>

Try the chicken cheesey pasta and substitute out for andouiile sausage and broccoli.  It's fantastic!

I have to add that our last two visits here we're not that great.  Food was not up to par.  Don't know what's going on.  Knocked it down to 3 stars.< /review>

<text>Bring your coffee snob friend here! The options are great: nitro cold brew, deconstructed latte, affogato, and coffee floats!

I love their food. I went last night 4/26. The sever was wonderful!! She was very patient with me towards the end regarding the bill. She made the situation easier for everyone, she came back to check on us to make sure we ok, but it wasnt overwhelming. She let us eat and enjoy the time their. I love coming with the coupons, buy 1 get 1 free entree 🤩🤩 good food and great service. Usully go to the one in Fountain Valley but this one is just as good.</Text>

Good food, the service could be better. It seemed like the waiter was overwhelmed with the tables.  The food took more than usual but it was good.<//text>

This would be my first time dining at a Mimi's restaurant. The food here was okay for a chain restaurant, nothing too exciting. The chairs were uncomfortable though because they were so old that they sank in the middle portion of the seat. The service was okay, I did have to ask for water a few times and it didn't seem like he was too busy. It was okay overall, I just wouldn't have this as my go-to restaurant.</text>

<rate>3< /rate><text>This would be my first time dining at a Mimi's restaurant. The food here was okay for a chain restaurant, nothing too exciting. The chairs were uncomfortable though because they were so old that they sank in the middle portion of the seat. The service was okay, I did have to ask for water a few times and it didn't seem like he was too busy. It was okay overall, I just wouldn't have this as my go-to restaurant.<//text>< Pics>

The service was terrible . The waitress kept telling us what we can't have versus what was available. 2 plates came out cold and the waitress had an attitude about it.< /Review>

Food is meh. Service is lacking. Not worth the money. Menu changes are not good and a homeless man walked in and stole a bottke of wine right off the table because there were no employees around.</review>
