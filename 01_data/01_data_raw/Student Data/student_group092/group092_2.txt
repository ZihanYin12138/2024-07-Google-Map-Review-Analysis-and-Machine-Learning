<Rate>5</Rate><Review>We love this service !
I called to Temperature Control to do the repair of my Carrier high efficiency furnace.
Temperature Control tech detected the circuit board and the blower motor failure.
In a very short time all necessary  parts were received and appointment for repair was scheduled.
Tech Hugo called 30 min before arrival, came on time, he did covered the floor before started, he finished all the repair and cleaned up after the work.
He checked heater and checked a/c to make sure that the system works properly after the repair and
patiently explained how to set the thermostat for comfort  temperature and energy saving.
Hugo was very friendly, efficient, timely, and professional .
We would  continue to use Temperature Control company  services again and would highly recommend it to everyone.
Thanks to all crew from
Temperature Control
and personally to Hugo!

This is an excellent AC & heating company - from the owner Dave to all the service technicians the service is outstanding - pleasant & competent. I've used them for years for bi-annual maintenance as well as a new system installation - very satisfied. Only drawback is receptionist - not pleasant nor courteous.< /text>

Heater fried by utility company power surge. Very easy to get an appointment, Temperature Control technician showed up on time, analyzed, identified and replaced the defective part. He was very knowledgeable and explained to me in details what he was doing. I feel very good about the entire transaction, will use them again as there will be more maintenance work to be performed in the future.< /text>

Temperature Control is awesome. They are clean, professional and very communicative. I started a maintenance contract with them after they came out on a Saturday in a heat wave to fix my broken A/C. The owner followed up by phone to make sure I was happy with the repair.

The maintenance contract is great. These people are very professional and trustworthy, which is necessary when dealing with something I know nothing about. I absolutely recommend them.< /Text>

<Review>Everyone at temperature control has been wonderful. It should be noted that I met with 7 other companies and they BY FAR seemed the best. They installed a new HVAC unit and we’ve been delighted with their service. We had one issue early on and they resolved it promptly. David, the owner personally spoke to us about all of the details when we were choosing a unit. He was upfront about cost, details, instal time and everything. Highly recommended.< /Review>< pics>

The guys at Temperature Control are awesome. Dave, the owner, is incredibly responsive and super professional. I’ve had multiple AC repair issues arise at inopportune times, like sweltering holiday weekends, and Dave has come through on each occasion. The technicians who work for him mirror Dave’s professionalism. I highly recommended Temperature Control if you have any HVAC service needs.</review>

We had worked with David previously, and were very happy with that experience. This last time Rey was the one helping us, He was very polite and took the time to make sure we understood what we were dealing with on our heat pump. It's been difficult at best to find a maintenance team that can be trusted. We believe that team is Temperature Control. That's not something we have been able to say easily! Please don't lose your ethical stance !!!!!!!</Review>

I used Temp Control on a new AC system installation last year and was very impressed by their professional service and more than competitive pricing. Plus they made some suggestions that greatly improved the cooling of the residence.  This last week they came and serviced an AC unit for me on a rental property.  Their technician Jaime was very clear in explaining the needed repairs to me and also to the tenants in Spanish. Thanks TC!< /text>

<Review>I've been using Temprature Control for all of our HVAC needs for 6 years and they have been nothing short of spectacular.  All of our systems function optimally and if any problems arise, TC is quick to respond and repair.< /Review>< user_id>

Hugo was on time.  He exercised the heating system and found that it was operating properly and ready to be available when the temperatures indicate it should be used.  He was congenial from start to finish.</Review>

Called Mr. Sparky on a Sunday morning because of a blown electric circuit (no power in master bedroom/bathroom) and the breaker box did not trip.  Spoke with Carrie who was so helpful!  The long/short was that Michael L. was at my home within 2 hours and after asking me a few questions immediately zeroed in on the problem which was a faulty outlet plug that had blown.  It was toasted on the inside and I was very lucky I didn't have a house fire.  It wasn't even the outlet that I had used to plug in my Rug Doctor carpet steamer which caused the problem in the first place.  This explained why the breaker box wasn't tripped also.  Michael is an amazing electrician and was very patient and explained the circuitry problem to me as my house is 30 yrs old with original wiring. He is also a student of quantum physics and history, as is my son, and was able to correctly recognize a math formula my son had written on a chalkboard in my garage (which I had no idea what it meant). My son is a math nerd!</text>

Honestly this was the best experience.  This was my second opinion and they fixed the problem $400 less than the last quote I had.   I was being scammed before and Jimmy was honest and fixed the problem in less than an hour.  Didn’t try to get me to pay $500 in Freon which I didnt need but was previously told I was.  Bottom line these people are on top it.  I am very happy.</text>

This is second time we have used this service.  They come twice a year to check HVAC, summer and winter Hugo showed up on time.  Hugo answered all my questions. Eventhough I'm change my filters regularly,   it was time again and AC working better since visit.  Cheapest way to prevent bigger issues is by going twice annual maintenance. Definitely recommend this guys.< /text>

<Review>Jaime and his crew were 10 minutes early.  Their truck was clean and they were presentable yet ready for the work.  He wasted no time assessing what he needed to do and made quick work in the capture of the refrigerant from 9 condensers.  i am very satisfied with the work and would highly recommend their company to anyone who wants the peace of mind that the work that's being performed is of the highest standards in the industry.</Review>< pictures>

<text>First time I used Temp Control was in 2012 for my  condo unit and  the technician detected the problem right  away and it turned out to be a simple fix which they didn’t even charge me the service fee for it.
Since then they’ve been my to go guys. Recently My wife and I decided to fully renovated our house and manage the project ourselves. We hired Temp Control to replace our HVAC system including the ducts, bathroom ventilations, large vent for the hood, and dryer ventilation which was bit of a challenge because of its location. They started and finished the job as scheduled without any issues or surprise charges. All work was done permitted and we had to have inspection at several stages all passed the 1st time and we’re now into our 2nd summer and the system has worked flawlessly.
Unfortunately you come across many contractors who are only about money and empty promises and for my wife and I these guys are 5* in every category.< /text>< resp>

Temperature Control is my preferred and trusted A/C service for over 15 years. I am very happy with their service, politeness, efficiency and quick response. They always come on time, complete their work on schedule and most impotent, they clean after they complete the work, and if it takes more than a day - they leave the job site clean every day.
I just recently recommended them to my family and neighbors. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a professional team with a reasonable price.<//Text>

Ray just did my annual service and is very knowledge as well as personable. I really like the fact that you pay for your annual maintenance (which includes 2 visits) at the first visit and your visit in 6 months is then covered. Would never use any other company for heating /air conditioning. And I have had to replace both my air conditioner and heater over the past 3 years.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I needed an HVAC contractor in Westwood to fix a unit on a house that was just sold, I was referred David at Temperature Control and after speaking with him, he got his guys out to us right away. There had been an issue with water getting into the underground duct work, once that was addressed, they came back out and put the AC system back together and now it works perfectly. I also wanted to mention the professionalism of Omar (tech) and Myra (office), they both also made this challenging situation so easy to deal with. Thanks David to you and your team!< /review>

< Review>
I've been a client since 2003 and am very grateful I became one.  The office staff is efficient and the on-site staff members are efficient, very friendly, and when required, repairs are explained specifically.  They arrive for their scheduled maintenance appointments on time and work quickly.  Today I had a repair which was  done by Chris in about 10 minutes because I had a last minute appointment which required my leaving my property unexpectedly.<//Review>

my wall furnace broke down and I called several companies threw the phone and they would only offer me estimates to have a central air unit installed instead of repair quotes temperature control was the only one that offered a service fee no questions asked . they sent  Omar out and he got my heater working and he double checked it to make sure it was safe to use ! great job temperature control on having great technicians like Omar... i highly recommend this company< /Review>

Thanks Omar and team! Installing a new HVAC system in an old house is definitely a big job. And while there have been some little adjustments to it -- which is to be expected -- you've always been on time, friendly, accommodating, and hard working.< /Review>

It is hard to find vendors that are honest, thorough and trustworthy, but Temperature Control is fantastic. Rey was our service provider and did a really thorough job in servicing our heating unit; they always wear booties when coming into the home and do a great job in cleaning up afterwards. We have used their services before in installing filters and their pricing was considerably lower than competitors that were clearly price gouging based on Zip Code. Great company--thank you!</Text>

<response>None< /response><review>It is the middle of the summer and my AC unit stopped working (for some of us that is the end of the world). In a panic i called the # on the sticker on my unit thing. The company told me that they were too busy and could book me for 3 weeks from now... SERIOUSLY??? TOO GOOGLE I GO. I looked up local companies and started calling around. I got ahold of Temperature Control and boy an I glad that I did! They were VERY helpful and effiecent in getting me a technician out THE SAME DAY!!!! After hours for a very reasonable price HELL IT IS 115 OUTSIDE i will pay whatever!!! The owner came out himselft and had my AC up and running within an hour of his arrival! THANK YOU TEMPERATURE CONTROL!!!<//review></record></dataset><record>
<review>A very personable and competent technician. I had no problem with the extra expense for an additional part once he explained why it was needed.< /review>< response>

First time trying this company out, i was recommended by a friend who also recommended this technician named omar . Well the problem is that i felt as though my heater wasn't working as efficient as it has before and it seemed to bug me since its been cold lately. I ended up setting an appointment with this technician and the same week he came and consulted me on the problem and gave me a great price on the repairs. Very happy with the service provided and great customer service from this technician, in turn will also recommend temperature control to anyone experiencing any problems.<//Review>

<review>We live in Orem and this is the place we bring our Pets. Perhaps it's because they are located in a more affluent area that is more likely to have pets that are treated as members of the household, I don't know. I do know that while things can seem a bit busy and perfunctory at times, they have staff and doctors that care. We brought our recent Affenpinscher puppy purchase to get his first checkout. He'll never know another place. The doctor we had was enthralled with his personality and asked to make sure we come to him in the future.
We brought our previous rescue rat terrier here for 15 years, and our Golden Lab here at the end of her life when we wanted a vet we preferred over our local options. We've been coming for a long time.
We brought our cats over the years. We even had an Abyssinian that had to have an eye removed and ear amputated because of cancer. They've been great with all of them. They may not be the cheapest option around town, but the prices are fair for what they provide.</review>< user_id>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>We are so happy with the excellent service we receive at Cottonwood Veterinary Clinic each time we come!  We have a mini pig and several goats that have visited the clinic .  We are greeted at the front desk with a smile by Kayla who is always so helpful on the phone and in person.  Dr. Martin is working with us to figure out why our Nigerian Dwarf is coughing. He really takes the time to listen to us and answer all our questions, as he advises us on our options.  We have many other clinic choices that are closer to our home, but we choose to drive to Cottonwood for the expert care that our animals receive there!< /Text>< pics>

We recently used the mobile vet service,  and it was so nice. Our dogs didn't go into panic mode having to go to a strange place, the pig and goats were able to stay in the comfort of there pens. Dr. Terra was great with all the animals and it was so much faster than going to the office. We highly recommend Cottonwood small and large animal for all your veterinarian needs, especially the mobile vet care.< /Text>

I am new to goat motherhood. My 2 new boys needed seen, Dr Martin got them in and performed surgery on the SAME day.  He made me feel completely at ease with what needed done. All the staff are super nice. Even my overly worried Mom phone call was handled quickly and with the utmost sincere care. Thank you for what you do and being so caring.< /review>

<Review>The best veterinary clinic I have ever worked with. As someone who has owned animals my whole life I never had many good experiences with vets. The vets at this clinic answer all your questions happily and talk you through things every step of the way. To put the icing on the cake they are affordable! Worth driving the extra 45 minutes to bring my animals here. The entire staff is friendly and helpful. You won't come across this many nice people working in the same place!</Review><gmap_id>0x54d2c449ee2c0987:0xd71444d028d5294d< /gmap_id>< rate>

I've been very happy with for my horse. Queso was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (basically diabetic) in Spring 2018. He had a bad case of foundering, however due to their care and a lot of home care, special boots, supplements and low sugar hay, he had minimal rotation in his coffin bone. This summer 2019 his sheath was swollen (even after I cleaned). They cleaned and gave him banamine....his swelling went down right away. So, I'm happy with the Vet.< /review>

I drive from Abbotsford to see Dr Tim. I have had several pets there and they all got marvellous care. Staff is great. The only problem I have is that they are getting so popular that it is getting hard to get an appointment! But they always fit us in.<//review>

One of our dogs has "dry eye" which is a terrible disease and cannot be cured.  Dr. Maarhuis has been our vet all this time and cannot praise him enough.  He has looked after "Rudy" and his eyes and when he didn't know what else to do he sent us to another vet who specialized in this.  He has also  looked after our "older" cat "Momma" and fixed her problem.  A big thank you to the staff and vets there.< /Text></record>

Perfect pit stop for our travelling vegan family!! Our family of 5  is travelling from Olympia, WA to Los Angeles, CA and were so happy to find this place offering so many great options! The fact that the woman making our order knew what was needed to make sure our order was completely veganized was a relief. Fellow vegans know how amazing Nate's vegan meatballs are.... They use 'em! Not sure what they use for the "roast beef" but it was amazing. We felt bad for dropping in and ordering 10 sandwiches (we will call ahead next time!) But decided to take dinner to go as well. They did great!< /review>

This place is the real deal. Their sandwiches are absolutely amazing. I don't know how they do it, but it really is the best sandwich shop in town. They have another location on the west side of the river. What they lack in decor they make up for in quality. I'll probably end up here again by the end of the week.</Text>

My family and I were driving through Redding and wanted to stop for a quick bite to eat somewhere on our way to OR and found TBLSS. It was not the best. The employees inside were welcoming and friendly and the food was yummy, however we waited close to half an hour for three sandwiches when we could have gone to Subway and waited for five minutes. The three girls behind the counter were chatting and singing and carrying on conversations with customers instead of working with a sense of efficiency and urgency to complete orders at a quicker pace. Yummy food but the service was so slow that I would not go back.< /Review>

A cute little hole in the wall with the friendliest staff.  This sandwich shop is amazing.  They have some EXTRAORDINARY vegan options and we will plan on going every time we drive though Redding.</Review>

<text>My sandwich was pretty good .but nothing special.   Silly sauce was nice and flavorful.   My wife also soecified on her order, no onions, and she ended up with onions on her sandwich.  My daughter complained that all she could taste on her sandwich was honey and nothing else.  My biggest issue was the service.   It took about 20 min. to make 3 sandwiches for our order,  and there was only 1 person in front of us.  The place also didn't feel as clean as i would expect from a restaurant.<//text>< pics>

Will never be going back... So sad too used to be a fav but the last few times they've gotten my order wrong and more than once and the girl who took my order was texting and ignoring me while trying to give my order. Should have known then to just walk out.</Review>

It took them about 45 minutes to make 3 sandwiches (that weren't even that hard to make!). It was really annoying. Plus they didn't even do the order right! The sandwiches weren't even that good either. If you aren't in a rush I would recommend going there, but if you are in a rush, go somewhere else.</text>< pics>

DELICIOUS!! We got two VV sandwiches that were both amazing. They were wise enough to confirm vegan/vegetarian with our orders, friendly, and quick. Fresh veggies, flavorful sauces, really delicious bread and very lightly toasted so it was perfect. Meatballs we're great. Cranberry teriyaki combo was great. And they weren't stingy with the avocado, hurray!!< /text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Date>1477430034131< /Date><text>I usually love this place I can always count on my soldier salute being warm and delicious but I sent hubby and he ordered 3 soldier salutes they said they didn't have avocado. They are right next to food max go get one. Also a girl working there was mopping and take stuff down my hubby said she slipped on the wet floor which didn't have a caution stand. She was rude to my hubby and said she was trying to close and it was only 4:15. When my hubby brought my sandwich it was cold he said they asked if we wanted hot or cold they never ask that it's always warm and there was no avaocado. We went back and he said he couldn't warm it for me it was the law not to take outside food and I said can I get avocado and he said we have been out all day I said can you go buy one next door and he said it's too expensive. We live 45 min away so I couldn't just go home and heat it I also didnt have time for him to make another which he did offer. My hubby said he will never go there again. I just think they were rushing to get home on a Sunday afternoon</text>< userid>

I ordered the #16 the salute and found a hair in my sandwich. I was super disappointed. It was good until then. I only made it like two bites in.<//Text>

I work at a store very close to TBLSS and I call in my orders well ahead of time for lunch as I have to close my store to go and pick it up. I called in an order today and was told 5 to 10 minutes for pickup and I got there 10 minutes later and waited for 10 more minutes in line as the employees slowly worked through the people in line. Then one employee yelled out"does anyone have a call in" I responded yes I do and she grabbed my sandwich off the warming tray and put it in a bag then threw it back on the tray. I had cash in hand just trying to get my food and leave to reopen my store. I asked the man at the revister if he could just give me my sandwich and keep the change so because I was in a hurry and he told me to wait in line. Call in should not be an option if I then have to wait in line on slow employees to make all the orders of people ahead of me. Charge the people in line thenmake the sandwiches and call them out. This wait is ridiculous and the fact that nobody here respects my time and my store and my customers that are waiting for me to reopen is just terrible business. Will not return.<//Review>

This shop serves the best sandwiches in redding,  the staff is friendly and goes the extra mile for their customers,  I frequent this location as it is near my work but would still go out of my way even if it wasn't.</review>

Food is gross, I waited 30 min for a sandwich. And still had to pay, and didn't even get a sorry!
The WORST little sandwich shop ever</Review>

Just moved here and was looking for a place I could get some basic gear and decided to go here off random choice from a Google search. I was blown away by the wide variety of product, had that genuine soccer store vibe taken to another level. They have multiple locations too. Would highly recommend.<//Review>

<Review>The service and attention to detail is just horrible. We went to purchase a pair of soccer turf cleats for my son. We spent one hour searching and finally found a pair of laceless adidas x's. The price tag on the bottom read $80. These shoes were a decent fit but not good for his foot. Since he really liked them, I relented since they were very cheap and it would make him happy. We went to the checkout counter and the cashier told us it was $180. I told him that the tag read $80. He went to check and even said it read $80. Even though he saw this he still said it would be $180. At the end of 1 hour of searching for a shoe we said no and went away. The cashier didn't even offer a compensation. We went home empty handed and my son was very dejected. If I had the choice I would give this shop a 0 star. We will never shop here again in hopes of avoiding FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.<//Review>< GmapID>

PARENTS IN TRACY, BUY CONSOLES HERE!This GameStop is the best one I've been to in Tracy and areas surrounding. The staff was helpful on my call prior to coming in. I wanted to know different console options and price. When I went in to the store they helped me right away and even laid out warranty options without being pushy. They didn't say any sales pitch lines. They genuinely helped me make a big purchase. When I asked about which games to get, they answered genuinely and were never condescending about my game preferences.< /Review>

Ordered during covid and the sign said order from their website and pick up in store. I did that and they watched me wait outside for 15 minutes for them to bring out my controller and they never did they just closed up the store and left.<//text>

<review>Expect elitists and the "new crew" telling you what you should buy instead of what you wanted. Expect to have your pre orders sold to somebody else and never get what you wanted or paid for. Expect to be disappointed, infuriated and bitter afterwards. The only person that attempted to save any bit of credibility that this place had was Josh and even then it left a gritty taste in my mouth and leaving me dissatisfied. I absolutely WILL NOT come to this store after my final purchase. Gamestop "prestige" where the only thing they excel at is severe disappointment.</review></record></dataset><record>

They have a lot of mini pop figures and not so much games. When I went in there some lady was haggling for more money and told her son that she couldn't afford to get him the controller. It was very awkward.</Text>

<Text>I've gone to this GameStop multiple times while living here in Tracy. If you know what you're looking for you can go in and out within about 5 minutes. But you may end up staying there longer due to how kind and friendly they are there. It's a nice place to stop and find your stuff.< /Text>< resp>

Always get the best of service from the guys....here at Gamestop...not to mention they take the time to know your name...and your likes/dislikes in the gaming arena. It helps to just walk in and they already pretty much know what you are looking for :-)<//Review>

I called to ask a question about ordering the psvita and talked to a employee named Nicole..she was very unprofessional! When I told her I was having trouble buying the psvita on line she said "well I don't know what to do for you"! Wasn't helpful at all! Then I asked to speak to a manager hoping she would be more helpful but she was worse!! Her name was Selena. Can we say very very low customer service skills. I will not go back to gamestop in Tracy ever again because of how low there customer service is. To bad, they lost a customer and money! Best Buy and Amazon here I come!!:) customer service is the main thing to look for and if you can't give great customer service you shouldn't be in busy!! You will no longer get business!!</text>

<Text>Me and the hubby went out for a date night. We just moved to LA so were first timers. There was a very open seating set up. The customer service was awesome. I had the jalapeño Mac and cheese and it was delightful. My boo had the chicken strips and he rated them a 7.5-8 out of 10 which is pretty good because he's a chicken connoisseur. Overall had a great time also we got to pay our songs on the jukebox with an app which was super cool.</Text>< pics>

<text>Had a great time. Small humidor with a decent selection. Very relaxed atmosphere but the best part is that the are open later than any place I know. Great staff and great clients. Definitely coming back!< /text>< pics>

👍Awesome place to pick up a great cigar!Friendly owner is knowledgeable and kind.

Currently, there's only two outdoor seats available due to this pandemic... but it's still nice to sit outside DT LA  watching the world zoom by in a hurry while you're relaxing outside puffing a wonderful stick!</text>

<text>What an awesome place to dance. San Francisco has not been known for its dance scene, but Bootie is definitely a club party that rivals that reputation. The mashups are generally very good and catchy. The drinks are decent price, and some of the bartenders pour heavy.</text>< Pics>

<user_id>100931939584718697838< /user_id><text>It's a pretty date heavy event with not a lot of singles, so it's not really much of a meat market. Fantastic place to take a date, though. Make sure you do a little pregaming, and then keep it going with the $6-10 drinks, depending on how much you want to class it up ($6 for beer, $7 wine, $8-10 mixed drinks).</text>< resp>

This place has been in business for over 30 years, and I can see why. They have a nice cigar selection, a comfortable lounge, and great customer service. The owner stayed open later than posted for me and a few others who arrived a little later in the evening than planned. If you are staying downtown, get a ride to the shop. Don’t walk. The tunnels make it a tricky walk. Trust me.< /Text>

Went to the Mondrian for Valentine's Day, was blown away by the level of service and attentiveness from start to finish!!  My girlfriends and I went to have a fun night out and when we walked in the door, we were in love with the art and space of the hotel, but our jaws dropped going in to the Sky Bar.  Amazing views of the city, such a special ambiance- relaxed beachy/boushy vibe (boushy is good in this instance)<//Review>

Whoever is giving this place 4 and 5 stars is insane, has never been to a decent cigar shop with a great selection, or just friends with the owner.  Like, check it out for yourself if you really want but this place has me now driving to the burbs or ordering online.  So sick of walking into a humidor with empty boxes on the shelves and a complete lack of in-stock selections.  Good luck and please step your game up!< /review>

If you looking for a quiet chill place that you can watch NFL NBA hockey games, get a decent smoke at a good value; then 2nd Street cigar shop is for you I love this place. I come down here often, the guys and Staff are very nice and cordial and the place is just wonderful, you want to check it out soon. #brianbaccusbrands approved<//Review>

Very inviting environment with a really nice selection of cigars.  If you have a question or need a recommendation, no problem, they are always willing to help find the perfect smoke.

I walked in the humidor to get my cigar of choice and didnt feel like I was being watched or have anyone breathing down my neck about purchasing something  ,which is the case when I have visited othe cigar lounges.  I give this place a five star rating they have a great selection of cigars ,make you feel at home and also have several TVs if thats your cup of tea also< /review>

Though the place is close nit, the cigar "cellar" is nicely organized with labels and the employees are very helpful in finding the right flavor for you.

This is a nice spot to smoke a cigar.  The TVs have sports on, there are a couple of tables on the sidewalk, the people are friendly, the selection is decent, and the prices are lower than most downtown smoke shops.</review>

I came here for the first time and everything about my experience was perfect! The foot massage and massage chair was really good, all the COVID-19 health and safety was taken into consideration, and the staff was very friendly! I am definitely coming back.</Text>

<rate>1</rate><review>I thought I'd give this place a try and was seriously disappointed.

They rushed me through a gel mani-pedi, did not soak my nails, barely filed my nails or touched my cuticles, which were in terrible shape at the time. They left at least two nails uneven and jagged, which I had to file myself later.

They did not rough up my nails or apply primer, which resulted in my nails chipping on the second day and completely lifting and peeling off before the week was over.

The pedicure was underwhelming. They cut a couple of my nails too short and hardly did any type of massage.

On top of all this, they were super overbooked, leaving my daughter to wait half an hour for a tech, even though we made appointments. They had several people show up at the same time as us and within 30 minutes of our arrival. They said they only had three techs and people would just have to wait. Why book all these people then? Why not call and reschedule if someone called in sick?

Why not provide decent service to begin with?< /review>< Pictures>

I was very impressed with the safety considerations in this time.  Plexiglass separations, wipes & sanitizer readily available at check in & chairs.  Plus, I got an excellent pedicure.< /Text>

<Name>Amaya Becvar Weddle< /Name><review>This is our favorite neighborhood pedicure salon. We come here as a family and they so lovingly care for my two girls, making special accommodations for the kids - including custom designs like flowers and moons. My husband even enjoys pedicures! Highly recommended for a great spot to pop in on a Saturday, or after work -- you can even hit up Trader Joe's on the way out!< /review><gmap_id>0x80ecf0d31c728e6d:0xc2de7e5d2d176e5f< /gmap_id>< time>

We were seated immediately after arriving around 4:30 on a Saturday. I got acrylics with gel on top plus a cute flower. They were really nice did a great job shaping my nails. I also wasn't entirely sure what I wanted but they walked me through it and made sure I understood how much it would all cost so that there weren't any surprises later. They gave us water bottles and warm neck pads and it was very relaxing. I LOVE my nails!< /Review>

Best pedicure with the most amazing service I've ever had! I walked in and even though they appeared full they immediately seated me with someone ready to do my nails! He was very kind, and as he seated me, he handed me a bottle of water and a hot pack for my shoulders! He did an amazing job on my nails and even noticed that I got nail polish on my hands and cleaned that off too! Great, thorough leg massage and excellent massage chair. I'll definitely be coming back here again! Oh! And they let me sit in the massage chair until my toes were dry! The send you home with real flip flops too, not the typical flimsy one-use ones!< /review>

<Review>I am in SLO for work and my nails were in desperate need of pampering.  I emailed for an appointment and they called me back and were able to get me in at the time I requested.  When I arrived, they provided a warm compress to put on my shoulders.  A bottle of water was also given.  During my pedicure, I was offered a soda because I elected to have the deluxe pedicure.  I WILL come back here when I am next in SLO.  Friendly, quality is top notch.  Price was not an issue as I felt I was valued and that goes a long way in my book.< /Review>< Pics>

Best service I have ever had at a nail salon. Great price for deluxe pedicure and regular manicure for $45.  Ask for Long, he did a fantastic job with the massage and paid attention to detail. Overall I will continue to go here. I almost fell asleep the massage was so relaxing, not a lot of chatter either.< /Review>

< Review>
My nails look very great and the paint looks great (I did gel polish, and one acrylic (I got the nail shortened in an accident)). My only complaints are that when they painted my nails one of the employees (female, short brown hair, older then 30) told me that my nail was actually cricked and that it wasn't her fault. I think that was a little rude and unnecessary. When I asked her to fix my acrylic because it was tilted, she told me my nail is cricked. Not her work. I disagree, my nail is straight, I have got my nails done at many other places and I have never had this issue. They also did not do any hand or arm massaging when they did my manicure. The overall nails look great, I just wasn't pleased with their costumer service.<//Review>

Somehow I ended up with the polish change instead without knowledge until my purse was thrown into my lap asking me to pay $7 (polish change cost). I've visited here many times with wonderful experiences but I probably wont be back after this. Didnt get the service I asked for and the quality of the polish change is worse than I would do myself.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had a great pedicure and I loved the massage portion of my mani-pedi. I knew I had a rough week ahead of me so I just went for a basic mani-pedi to clean up what I had. I was with a group of 6 for a bachelorette party, so I was fairly distracted. I was not impressed with my manicure but I also was not paying attention to what she was doing. I really needed my cuticles cleaned up but it didn't look like she did anything or maybe I didn't convey what I wanted appropriately. If you need a good pampering, this place will take care of you but I cannot guarantee good clean cuticles< /Text>

This is a really fun spot for all ages. The games were a blast and the ambiance is really cool. I can't wait until they get their liquor license so you can enjoy cocktails and brews as part of the experience. Apparently that's all in the works. We had the drunken Thai noodles and they were decent.<//Text>

Cool games - all working. Didn’t try food or drinks but looked good. Restrooms were clean. Neat “rooms”, very detailed. Lots of fun for kids too.</text>

Such a great spot! I only wish it were bigger! Excellent location too! Pay at the door, games are included in the cover and the entry fee goes toward a food coupon for the same amount (for you to use or not use). Oozing 80's and 90'a flair! One of my favorite spots in this whole desert!<//Review>

Really cool spot. It used to be a flat cover for free games. Now they are actually coin op 25cents a pop. Just like being in the arcade as a kid except I get to drink and order apps. They also have a huge selection of board/pub games as well. The food is good, drinks are good, games are good. 👍<//review>

I really wanted to love this place. I was excited about the idea of having a classic arcade in my area. Unfortunately it is loud and dark, and most of the games I played had a problem with the controls. Non operational buttons, joysticks that didn't respond in one direction, etc. The table service was pretty good and the food is unique and interesting and fairly tasty. Unfortunately our waitress said that they are getting rid of table service next week! In the future, patrons will have to order at the bar, pick up their food, and find a spot to sit.

I like the idea they are going for here, but I am really struggling to find a reason to go back. I'll give it a little while and try one more time, but if all my favorite games are broken the next time I visit, I am afraid that will be my last.< /text>

Awesome selection of cool games but it smelled like there grease trap back flowed. There is no all you can play, you have to use tokens which wouldn't be bad if the website was updated to tell you before hand. Also the attitude of the staff was un reasonable and rude. Food over priced for what it is and limited menu. There going down hill fast.<//review>

They serve great bar food to go along with the bar. Gotta get the burger,  it had a little kick to it. Also affordable, $10 to get in $8, of which can be applied to food and the games are all free.

Absolutely a stellar addition to the area. Fantastic food, amazing selection of games, friendly staff, and great entertainment. Where else could one jam out to old green day while shrek plays on a tv and drink bourbon in a beanbag chair whilst playing super Mario? Nowhere else. 6 stars.<//text>

The games are fun older games we grew up on. The drinks were good and the staff were nice. We didn't have any problem finding games to play. Sadly they didn't have my old school Favorite "Robotron 2084". That last bit aside we will be back and next time we will eat there. One of the people in our group is a Vegan and I believe they have food for her as well.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Came here during Dinah Shore, such a great space! Glitch has all the essential classic arcades and a few great pinball machines. They don't have their liquor license yet, so the space serves Mocktails, they have a Cadillac Mocktail that's on point. The food is worth the trip alone, I had the Num Pong and will travel back to Palm Springs just for that.< /text>

So excited about this place being a new addition to Palm Springs and close enough to frequent from the hi-desert area! They have an amazing selection of arcade games, small decorated rooms from the 90s where I felt right at home playing Nintendo on my bean bag chair, skee ball! Pinball, board games and the list goes on. I see a lot of people here complaining about the quarters, but I think it makes it special and genuine. So bring your piggy banks! Also, the food! A simple dreamy Asian menu bursting with flavor and fresh ingredients. Such a nice unique change from your typical gastro pub style food. I got the Kung fu noodles and vegan egg rolls. Me and my crew enjoyed it so much we ordered double of everything. The staff was super friendly, great music all night, The vibes were high all night long. This is 100 percent my new favorite spot!bdont miss out and bring your piggy bank!<//text>

<text>I'm just so happy there's another, really chill and  decent arcade place in the Coachella valley/ palm Springs area.
Though the servicing on the cabs can use work , I do wish all of them were functional. Especially the MVC2 and Neo Geo multicab.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

The place smelled horrible and I was under the impression you pay an entrance fee for unlimited games but that's not the case you play with quarters. When I told the bartender it smelled she said maybe I should open a door??  Ummm okayy so we just left. Sad cus I really wanted to like this place.<//text>

Ok so tried this place 2 times and they just can’t seem to nail the atmosphere right and the food needs to be changed out because it doesn’t work for PS, give this place less than a year and I know it will be closed if they don’t change things quick!!

I’m going to give you free advice that normally would cost companies.

The wall needs a projector and screen with small stage in the corner for a cool fun karaoke night

Get rid of the Asian food and put in All American Gastro Pub style food (I’m Thai) and telling you this
Flatbread pizzas burgers tons of cool appetizers
Salads sandwiches, milk shakes, cool healthy adult smoothies ice cream sundaes

The asian isn’t family friendly for PS.

No cover charge!  Fill the space who cares if people aren’t spending money.  No one wants to goto a place that is empty you need bodies in there  anyways and if they aren’t cute people than your not marketing or promoting correctly.

Have birthday parties
Big company parties
Charity events

With all the other successful gaming bars we thought you would of had the formula down like Coinopp in San Diego and of course infamous Button Mash in Silverlake</review>

Came during my bachelorette trip and while the games and food were ok (despite many of the games being out of order), I’ve never been to a place that gives you attitude when you try to pay your bill. After sitting at our table for our server for over 20 minutes, we thought maybe we misinterpreted and were supposed to pay at the bar. Upon walking to the bar, the male server who was not busy, walked over and when we alerted him we wanted to pay our bill, he obnoxiously and condescendingly mocked us for not going and finding our server ourselves saying it was “so hard” to have to go find our server ourselves. It was very rude and distracted me the rest of the night from having fun. We were being polite and did not deserve to be mocked randomly and for no reason at all.< /text>

Really fun, great specialty cocktails and accommodating for kids. Please though.. a kids menu!! Nearly everything on the menu was fried (and super salty) which I know is south east Asian cuisine but I could do with some fresh veggies and dip or really, anything unfried. That said the food we did get was awesome  but for me, I could only do little bits a a time. Lumpia,  "quesadilla", glitch burger, yuca fries, homemade chips,  Singapore noodles.. all tasty. Lastly,  as far as the atmosphere,  it was chill, great music, fantastic bartenders and service. A bit dark, nearly impossible to play ping pong. But we arent there for pingpong! 🤣< /review>

<Review>This please is great! Nice atmosphere and definitely one of a kind in the desert. When you walk in you definitely get and 80/90 vibe, they have asian style of food and for the most part the food was okey. I myself ordered the Glitch num pang and i love it but my family had their food and it look great but was not blow my mind away great. I think they should add a little more simpler options as like a hamburger, Nachos, Chicken sandwiche ect. The arcade area is outstanding definitely brings back memories of early childhood even tho there are some games that need repair(1 or 2) it is still alot of fun and definitely worth it! They also offer board games and card game!  Lastly all of the staff were very polite and accommodating! I will for sure be going  again.< /Review></record>

The beef soup smells very bad, seafood tofu soup only have two clams, two mussels, and two small shrimps. The two stars is for the purple rice which is good.</Review>

So I dropped by because of the buy one get one free offer and the staff wouldn’t let me bring home leftovers even after I paid. It’s my food if I paid for it so I don’t understand the point of this rule. Also asked for purple rice and was told by the waitress with the short hair that there wasn’t anymore. A lady and her family at the table next to me asked for purple a few minutes later and got it. Won’t be stopping by again. Food was alright but similar to any korean beef noodle restaurant and the bathrooms smell like urine.</review>

This is a restaurant that my father-in-law from Hong Kong praised highly. The beef soup is so good originally. The seafood pancake is one that you don't want to miss. And the server is very friendly.</Review>

Delicious rib soup. I didn't rate it 5 star because the hygiene needs to be improved. The plates and bowls are still quite sticky when served .<//text>

Comfort food
Their beef broth is good.
Try Bean sprout soup when you are feeling under the weather.</text>

My husband is Korean.  I have had my share of K food.   This restaurant was not the worst (which was at Big Lots's shopping block on Colima.)    This restaurant is just mediocre.</review>

<Text>Ordered three to-fu pots, when waitress finally brought them up, one of them were wrong. Waitress looking at the wrong order and murmuring "I did tell kitchen beef flavor, how come...”
There were less "side dishes" appetizers than other hot pot restaurants nearby.
First bite of the kimchi was ok, second and third had weird taste in my mouth.
Took a long time for them to bring back the right order. When others almost finished their food.
Went home, major stomachache and need to go restroom every 15 minutes.
I will never come back again.</Text><gmap_id>0x80c32a602ee12a07:0x2907fbe09687f15f< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Originally, it was said that the soup was famous, but the stone pot bibimbap that I ate was also delicious.
The soft tofu the party ordered wasn't bad either!
I'm going to come again to eat soup.

(Original)
원래 국밥이 유명하다고는 하는데 제가 먹은 돌솥 비빔밥도 맛있었어요.
일행이 시킨 순두부도 나쁘지 않았습니다!
국밥먹으러 또 와보려합니다.<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I submitted Seolleongtang, but there was no rice. When I went back and said that rice was missing, I gave him a meal. I opened the lid of the rice to eat, and mold on the rice ... I was paid to eat something like this. I went back and complained, so this is the rice I cooked in the morning ... I won't go again !!!!

설렁탕을 투고했는데,,,, 밥이 없었다. 다시가서 밥이 빠졌다고하니 밥을 하나 주었다. 먹을려고 밥 뚜껑을 여니 밥에 곰팡이가... 이런걸 먹으라고 돈받으며 팔다니... 화가 치밀어 올랐다. 다시가서 컴플레인하니깐 아침에 해논 밥이란다.... 다시는 안간다!!!!<//Text>< GmapID>

The taste of the food wasn't too bad

To make me feel like I have to come back there

추억과 향수를 동시에 주는 실내 분위기와

또 가게 될 것 같습니다< /Text>< pics>

A real Gem, in the rough. Good pour, nice atmosphere and great servers. Has been a staple in the community forever. The new owners are local and friendly, easy to talk too and they are always coming up with great food nites. Place to be and people to be with.< /text>

Great atmosphere,  very laid back with good service. Mixed drinks and/bottled or draft beer. Friendly staff and patrons. Pool table and juke box with a mix of music styles. Clean establishment smoke free and comfortable.<//Review>

I was visiting a friend in town and he took me here to shoot some pool and have and adult beverage or three. From the road it looks like a dive bar and it  definitely is. Quiet place that the locals hang out at but with that being said we had a fun time at the Red Hill Saloon.</Text>

<text>Awesome place my dad's been going there for years and I've been there probably 10 times total every time it's staff is friendly, prompt and very cool. Has a pool table and outside smoking area and tons of different kinds of alcohol. there is never much of any wait kind of a hidden gem that's never too busy.vI would recommend to anyone looking to relax and have a few drinks and possibly play a game of pool.</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< Time>

Staff does not take covid seriously. The girl at the window was wearing a mesh mask. This place is nasty even for McDonald's. Don't eat here. You're better than this.< /review>

< Review>
Employees are mostly very friendly. Kim is always great and professional and quick. I gave a 3 because there have been about 5-6 times in the last month that the drive thru has been closed for business due to some issue with registers or something. I have witnessed dozens upon dozens of cars come and go because it was down. Lost revenue big time! And business taken elsewhere like Burger King or other coffee shops. It would be nice to  have dependable service for less inconvenience. Thank you</Review>

Honestly, McDonald's is McDonald's. But we waited at east 15 min for our food bc of "door dash orders" and when we got our food it was cold and the employee was wearing a yellow mesh mask. Trash. No responsibility in the safety of your customers. Im absolutely appalled and she is lucky I didnt open my mouth in person.<//Text>

<Text>Even though the staff was sweet and swift, the product was extremely poor quality! I ordered a large Oreo Mc.flurry, and what I got was the smallest Mc.Furry I have ever seen! It wasn't even filled up all the way. The quality, and appropriate serving sizes should accommodate for the "lack of large cups." DO NOT GET A MC.FLURRY FROM THIS MC.DONALDS! Extremely unsatisfied customer! I got ripped off!</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMe7GGhfUWea2ksPI4U30iGYDbjoVZXX0cn_FdL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNC2s8yfvkcG15QAAQs4krCDdJsPyV_yI-75HEJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQnR1iVkMOos7KolCaa40s1aygSsRIcQXG1rQx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x54d066372f0a4ee7:0xc510db607dca29a3</Gmap_id></record>

Quite possibly the worst McDonald’s in America. This is a poor town and a poor location so food isn’t thrown away - whatever you get is what has been sitting for hours and it’s always cold. Unfortunately the only 24hour option in the area, although it’s borderline inedible< /review>

Love their Hashbrowns. I always get at least 5 of them whenever I go. However their drive thru lines are atrociously long. Usually not worth the wait if there's a long line.</text>

The service is really slow. There's always a line at the Drive-Thru. If you go inside theweight is longer as they are constantly training. The food itself tastes good, and staff pleasant. Be aware staff occasionally where's coverings over their mouth only.<//Text>

They didn't have half the items on their menu and the girl taking orders at drive thru grunted at me because I was ordering for my family of 4. I was very nice and calm the entire way, the manager had to ring me out (I didn't say anything). Food was standard< /text>

Yet did not deny access to another man without a mask and instead offered him one to conduct his business. Is McDonald's picking and choosing who to provide masks to? This looked so discriminatory to me and my family. We were also treated poorly by both managers but I don't want to take away from the real problem here.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1</rating><review>Went here a few days ago and got breakfast and asked for two Iced Caramel Mochas of which I had a coupon for a free Mocha.  When the woman came to the window she gave us two Iced coffee looking drinks, so I said "These are not Iced Caramel Mochas.  Where is the cream and caramel?"  She said the are, and they do not come with cream and caramel. I told her they do so she went off and put cream and caramel on the top.  We drove off and tasted them and they were horrible iced coffee that she just put cream and caramel on, so it got thrown away.  Then when my son looked at the receipt as I drove, he said she charged us for the two Iced Caramel Mochas,  but did not give us the free one which she scanned the code.  So nearly $9 thrown away.   Apparently they do not have a clue what the heck they are doing.< /review>< Name>

The fries were hot!!!!  The customer service was great.  I ordered a Crispy Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich and got a McChicken sandwich big difference in coating and price.  What a rip off.  The quarter pounder with cheese deluxe didn't have all of its items on the burger.  It  had one slice of cheese, NO ONIONS, a sliver of lettuce and a couple tomatoes!  The fries were hot which is a plus however the oil they were fried in was old tasting and had a very weird after taste.  After spending the amount of money we did and knowing we didn't get the items we paid for it makes you wonder.  We are from out of town and the drive back to fix the order would have been long!  We won't be back and it was a lesson learned.  Make sure you check your order BEFORE leaving.  I am still wondering when McDonalds is actually going to do what the commercial states!  NOTHING is fresh made to order when you order it!</Review>

I think I really liked this place but I will no longer be going here as they have gotten cheap with sauces. They only give one sauce for six chicken nuggets. I go out of my way to go to restaurants that are not stingy and this is now one of those to avoid.</Review>

<Text>TERRIBLE FOOD! Ordered two burritos, a hash brown, and two cheeseburgers with only ketchup and cheese. What we got was a fish sandwich, no hashbrown, and two cheeseburgers with everything on it and so much extra ketchup that the patty was sogged through. Tried to scrap everything off of them but they were soggy and tasted like they were left out for a week. WILL NEVER GO BACK< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Asked for no lettuce on the no bun hamburger and was told lettuce doesn't come on it.  Clarified hamburger patty and ketchup only.  And we received lettuce on it second day in a row.< /review>

Haven't been to McDonald's in a while but the wife wanted a fillet of fish. That alone was almost $5 and it was about half the size it used to be. I got a big Mac meal and the bill was $18.03. For another $5 we could of gone to the Chart Room and both got the best fish and chips around with more food than you can eat. Don't think I be back to Micky D's except in desperation. Too many good places to eat for way less. I guess that's why there were only two other people eating at the tables.</Text>

<username>Lhawkins<//username><Time>1542476451502< /Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>First off, Crescent City is the most beautiful little town on the coast that you could find. While on a business trip I always stop by this McDonald's for breakfast and they are always busy. With that said, just because they are busy does not mean that they lack in customer service in expediting orders and getting people in and out as quickly as possible never rushing anyone. I've had nothing but great experiences going there. My food is always hot, my order is always accurate and the the ladies and gentleman at the front front counter always have a smile and a warm welcome waiting for me. I know this is hard work so I really appreciate the fact that I can go in and be treated like I'm a neighbor or a friend and still get a great dining experience. This cannot be said about all McDonald's which is why this one is so rare. I hope that one day everybody gets a chance to have a dining experience such as I have had at this McDonald's in Crescent City every time I go. Thanks again you guys the team McDonald's Crescent City rocks!<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Nuggets tasted old, the ¼ pounder was hot but chewy. I've had much better out of the same restaurant. I guess the quality if the food is dependent on the standard of quality of the crew working that particular shift. Friendly faces at 11:30 am  on a wednesday. But the food was not so friendly</Text>< user_id>

Owner only cares about his Brookings restaurant. I don’t know why the corporation hasn’t closed the Crescent City McDonald’s down. Poor  and rude service, cold fries, burnt eggs, no ice or carbonation in soda, over stuffed bags, dirty bathrooms, non-paying customers hangout, upside down fries in bag and they always forget an item you purchased while in drive-throu, I almost forgot the 15 plus minutes wait in drive-throu. Years back the kids and I use to enjoy coming here.<//text>

<Text>It took over 12 minutes to get 2 sausage biscuits and 2 sausage egg and cheese McGriddles. There was no one in front of us and it was 9:45 so I don’t know why it would take that long. They also refused to use my app coupon (that would save $3) because they already used one of their other promotions that only saved us $0.30. I purchased an additional McGriddle in order to use the coupon. But they wouldn’t let me use it</Text>< pics>

<text>Slow service but friendly.
Prices of course are great its McDonalds cheapest place to probably get a gut ache but is sure tasty.

Heading home Monday evening after Thanksgiving, stopped for a burger, had to wait by the drive thru order board several minutes and the guy kept keying the mic., which he probably does often to relieve boredom. Messing with customers for fun and entertainment. Called him on it at the window and he lied about the weather causing the interference. Told him it wasn't my first rodeo and I'm familiar with the sound of a mic. being keyed. Arrogance isn't a virtue kid. Got to the outtake window, and an unpleasant young lady handed me the bag. The bacon cheeseburger and fries had definitely been sitting more than would be considered acceptable, but I was so hungry I just choked them down and chalked it up to "Never the McDonalds in Crescent City again", to many other superior fast food choices to be subjected to that nonsense and crummy food.</text>

< Review>
Upon entering the McDonald's, I was greeted by Amy, a friendly person, who acknowledged me and then the other person at the counter assumed the duties of taking my order. As usual, it was clean but busy. My order came quickly and I found a seat in the rear of the dining area. The chicken sandwich was good and cooked and presented well.< /Review>

I'd say most of the time I've had a very pleasant experience but tonight for some reason they just could not or would not correct a very small issue with the temperature of a cheese burger. The burger was cold and didn't even melt the cheese it was so cold. So I returnded it to be warmed up and they gave me another cold burger! I didn't even bother informing them the second time< /review>

<review>Was looking where I wrote my comment.

This restaurant was very clean. The employees were kind, smiling, & presentable. By that I mean their clothes were clean, shirts tucked in, hair neat. These things make a big difference.  One of our burgers was made wrong. Ordered no mayo & oops! mayo. No problem. Took it back & they are making it again. Not scraping the mayo off...re-making the sandwich.  That's how it should be. All done with a smile.
Thank you. Also, thanks to the manager & other employees here. Working with the public isn't always easy. Working "fast food" can be challenging. These folks did excellent.

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I want to put 2 stars but just can't:  bathrooms always kinda dirty; have waited 10/15 minutes with a line of people waiting to order, with no one at all manning register. Pretty unbelievable. They do not give reciepts but I've been asked point blank if I paid for a coffee when I asked for a refill. Man. Not ok. . . Different employee, I think her name is Verona?(short, older thick hips, pig tails), when I got to register to order, she looked me up and down and barked "were you in LINE??". . . I was stunned. "I am in line" is all I said. She kept a nasty look on her face just staring me down. What in the world? Then finally, rudely, asked what I wanted, as if I was wasting her time delaying my order. (I am not kidding, or exaggerating). The person behind me was standing well behind me, looking as stunned as I. Turns out several folks I know have been verbally accosted by this employee. When I told this story, they all knew exactly who it was. (Unbelievable, that, really.) Another employee told me she is OFTEN like this with customers, but VERY different when management is in front. Ugh. . . . All that said,  seniors get .25¢ break on coffee price but unlike everyone else, get small only, and not choice of size like everyone else(at THIS location only, per my experience). . . No more wifi either at McD's. So. . . .When I found myself dreading going near the counter, wondering what abuse or insults I'd have to suffer, I just stopped going. Ths is NOT how I intend to start my morning! . . Conversely, BK always has clean bathrooms, very sweet and sunny employees, good, cheap coffee, and wifi. Nuff said.<//Review>< pics>

While I was present, a oerson had a seizure.  Three employees handled that emergency like pros and also with deep kindness, offering comfort as well as first aid.  They had taken the time at  some earlier point to know this person by name.  I was so deeply impressed by the entire team's poise and kindness.</Text>

A lot of customers with not enough employees to handle them all ... Order was incorrect ... And, I ordered milk but didn't receive it ... The manager needed to find the receipt, bc I was never given one,  which took a while,  for proof that I actually purchased the milk when both the cashier and myself specifically told her I had paid for it ... The manager questioned us both again bc the cashier should have known they didn't receive their shipment of milk that morning ... TMI that I didn't need to hear ... Next time,  I'll pass on this McDonald's<//Review>

False advertising, wrong pricing, horrible attitude. The manager was absolutely rude. I wouldn't mind paying a bit extra, even a 50% markup but the manager was rude and condescending about it. If she can't do her job to update the POP then she shouldn't be a manager.

Advertised $1 coffee and it is now 1.50 served with a frown.<//review>

McDonald's is McDonald's.  However,  every time I go in there the bathrooms are out of toilet seat covers. And the floor is gross.

They do a ok job of keeping the lobby clean. They are good at keeping tables clean. And they are all pretty friendly.</review>

Poorly managed. Over 8 staff, at 11 am had over 10 customers waiting by the counter while several staff stood around doing nothing. Five customers had to take their receipts back to the cashier and request their orders after waiting for more than 10 minutes. :(. Not the quick stop you expect a McDonald's to be.< /review>

I have eaten lunch at KFC for less than $8 for two people. I asked for an orange juice and she automatically wrong up the biggest size. I had no idea it came in different sizes. I only go to McDonald's once a year when my wife incests. Then they didn't deliver the orange juice or an extra coffee I had to re explain what I ordered. And the hashbrowns tasted like they use rancid oil. One good thing when we got into the car I told my wife now I don't have to come back here for another year.<//review>< Pics>

I I have always liked McDonald's their food is Affordable but I got to say the new remodeling is so uninviting they took out all the booths did they used to have in this McDonald's and put in these weird table and chairs it's all modern and it looks weird and it's not comfortable.<//Review>

Every parking spot had a dish tray in it. Was forced to park away from building. Then when I went inside was asked to move my car by a semi truck driver right after getting my food. The McDonald’s employee offered to hold my food but guess what... I’m a customer in your store and this was a terrible experience. I don’t want cold food and we all know that if I don’t eat this food right away then it’s pretty much  Un-eatable.<//text>

<Text>They staff is rude and judgementle. If you can find a McDonald's with a friendly staff your doing good. If you people do not like working in the public or serving the poor then you shouldn't have a job in a customer service feild with a dollar menu.< /Text>< pics>

Okay, you can never expect a McDonald's to actually be good, but it was one of the highest rated restaurants in the town. Most others averaged 2 stars, while this averaged 3.7. This may have been the worst McDonald's I've ever stepped foot in. The bathrooms had such a foul stench that my entire family was turned away. It took far too long to get three quarter pounders. A man wearing a pirate hat was seated at the table next to us. A huge group of punk teenagers came in and started blasting loud rap music. The food wasn't even hot. Please avoid eating at this McDonald's or even anywhere in Crescent City at all.<//Text>

It's MacD's yeah sure it's all processed food and bad for you... But it's got a flavor all of its own that is delicious damn near addicting.  I'm giving it a three for inflated pricing however and not having any dollar items on dollar menu.<//review>

It took over 10min to make a sandwich, and this is not a first time.  And when I came home and looked at the sandwich, it looked wrong, like maybe someone messed with the sauce.  🤧 so it went into trash.  Poor service and maybe someone spit on my food.   Never going there again.<//review>

Clearly you can tell they don't stay sterile and are not one bit on code for health concerns. After the meal within half an hour 2 of us 3 got ill with their stomach.

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>They have the worst customer service I've ever seen. To call this place fast food is ridiculous 13 minutes is what I sat in the Drive-Thru waiting for them to complete two orders. There's no smiles, I see the manager Rene cursing at an employee from the outside of the drive-thru window while she's smoking a cigarette very unprofessional.<//review></record>

<review>The one worker  there at the drive-thru was rude, extremely. We order 4 cheeseburgers and 1 drink and we received the drink a it later, but while waiting for our burgers the worker rolled her eyes at us asking "what are you waiting for?", while glaring at us. That's not all when we asked for condiments she then rolled her eyes at us.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><name>PaKou Vang< /name><time>1498698019661<//time><rating>3</rating>< userid>

😊Brookings; 5 🌟 cleanliness, 4 🌟 friendliness, 4 🌟 food (which is good for McDonald's)
😁Crescent City;  5 🌟 cleanliness, 5 🌟 friendliness, 4 🌟 food
😊Eureka (North) 5🌟 cleanliness, 4 🌟 friendliness, 4 🌟 food
👎Eureka (South, with PlaySpace) 2 🌟 cleanliness, 3 🌟 friendliness, ? food [(we got drinks and left, I ended up with the runs: you may make whatever assumptions you desire.) We will not be back at this location.]< /Text>

Mayor McCheese was helping Big Bird at the Fry Guy's station when I walked by and Henrietta Hippo yelled, "Tarnation!"  I jumped, and turning quickly on my heels, I caught sight of The Professor and MaryAnne kissing in the corner.

Just joking.  McKee Dee's was great!< /text>

Food was nasty cold and greasy, the floors stunk and need to be swept, my double cheeseburger only had one slice of cheese, I called the manager and she said I was lying about it and to get over it. Mostly all the employees are rude, (especially Cody miles) the bathrooms probably haven't been cleaned in a year. Toilet was dirty mirror had prints all over it, there was no tp, tables need wiped, and for whatever reason when I want to go thru the drive thru they have a bunch of their employees standing by the menu hanging out. It's is outrageous, I'd never come to this location. Not a good or sanitary McDonald in my opinion.< /Review>

Been in the good industry a long time. Drive thru servicr is very quick, little or few errors and pleasant. Food is what you expect from a McDonalds. But what sets thrm apart from any other McDonalds, fast food places or eben most restaurants is, the cleanest bathrooms i have come across at any of these places. Well done. Keep up the great cleanliness and friendly service.<//review>

<text>Never again ever in C.C...The food servers do things to others food they don't like saw it one day so never again even though this used to be my favorite place to eat I'd rather drive 20 miles to Brookings than eat at this one.  Managers use to sell drugs out of drive thru from what I hear you still can order drugs from drive thru, just order a specific child's meal. Corrected for my mistake I mixed up Burger King with you.

<Review>This location was severely understaffed for breakfast.  8 cars in the drive thru so we walked in to order.  Line to the door. After ordering, took about 15 minutes to receive our 3 breakfast meals. Slow service, no smiles.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Very rude to my wife. An employee literally made her cry. Yelled at her and accused her of stealing just because she got a refill on her drink five minutes after purchasing it. Unbelievable. We shall not return.<//text>
