Easy and friendly check in; I left my car there and picked it up when it was ready, and will return for my next oil change and maintenance. Very helpful staff, who alerted me to other things that needed attention.< /Text>

It is so hard to find a mechanic that you can trust. This shop is the place. Mindy in the office is so nice & went out of her way to find a new engine for my 14 Honda & they are hard to find. Everyone in my family goes here. AAA certified or verified. I will definitely be going back.<//Review>

<review>This was a terrible experience!!! My sunroof started to act up so I found ORR and chose this place based on Yelp reviews. Boy, was that a mistake!!! I scheduled a 12:30 appointment, but took it in earlier, at 8. The man at the desk said it would be fine and they would take at look at my car after the one they were working on.  At about 10:30 I got an automated text asking if I was okay with work estimate of $139.00. I agreed to it. At 3:15 or so when I had not heard from them I called, only to have them tell me they hadn't ordered part yet or calculated my total.  Confused, I asked what the estimate was for, if not for the work! He said for diagnostic inspection.  He would call me back shortly with total.  At 5:10 when I had still not heard back, I called again only to have the put me on hold for about 10 minutes and come on to tel me it would be $860. I said no thanks!  Turns out they took the liberty to run a full inspection on my entire car. Chris & Nathan they did this as a courtesy to me. HA!!! I  asked them to check my rooftop, what made them think it was okay to check my entire car! Horrible communication, deceitful practices, and terrible customer service.</review>< Pictures>

I had a very difficult, hard to diagnose, problem with the electrical system in my 2017 Subaru, which caused my battery to frequently lose its charge.  Apparently, it's a problem with 2017 Subaru Foresters.  The mechanic took all the time he needed and spared no effort to discover the source of the problem and fix it.  It took some time, but he didn't give up and didn't just tell me I needed to drive it more frequently (which I've since learned other mechanics have done when faced with this problem.)<//text>

My daughter had previously used Orr for an analysis of a problem she was having with her car, so I called hoping to get some information for another problem she was having with her car. I cannot tell you how much I appreciated the advice Nate gave me over the phone! He went above and beyond to help me. He couldn’t have been nicer or more helpful. I can’t thank him enough!< /review>

I have found the shop for my current and future cars. From the first visit, the staff at Orr Automotive made me feel welcomed. They are straight forward, do not hesitate to answer all my questions and thoroughly explain their service recommendations. Their passion for cars and what they do provides me with a sense of security that my cars will be well taken care of. Most importantly their prices are great! I have and will continue to recommend this shop to others. Thanks again Orr Automotive!!< /text>

The mechanics here are good people. I've been taking my Volvo S40 there for over 3 years. They do quality repairs with fair prices. They have been nothing but helpful and kind. Nate always explains the car problem in terms that I understand and shows me the parts that were replaced. When I'm tight on money he lets me know what needs to be done now and what can wait plus they offer carecredit to help with the payments. When I had an accident and other person's insurance provided me with a rental car Orr dealt with the rental company regarding how long I would need the rental for. He also advised me on how to deal with the guy that hit me because he just wanted to give me cash instead of go through his insurance. Nate advised against that and thank goodness because the cost of the damages were WAY more than the guy was offering. That's just a few of the many ways that he has helped me out over the years.

I would recommend this auto shop to anyone that wants an honest mechanic with quality service at an affordable price.<//text>

<Text>While visiting friends in Montclair, my wife's Toyota Matrix started leaking under the dash (on her new suede shoes!). We weren't excited about the idea of another breakdown driving from Southern to Northern California, but neither were we excited about going to an unfamiliar mechanic. After research, we found ourselves at Orr Automotive and we're super glad we did.

John treated us right.

Tl;dr: if you need a diagnosis and solution to a car problem in the Montclair area, go to Orr Automotive. They were kind, knowledgeable, treated us fairly, and acted like they truly wanted to solve our problem affordably and with quality.<//Text>< response>

I've had nothing but good experiences at Orr. This time they took care of a pretty big repair in an amazingly fast time so that we could go on vacation on time. I also appreciate that they are always honest and don't try to sell you on fixing stuff that doesn't need to be fixed.  Via Sure Critic</Text>< pics>

I've been coming here faithfully for my oil changes and also a few years ago my car was under warranty thru Carmax and they sent me here. They are very helpful to me all the time. I highly recommend this place for all your maintenance and car issues. They are very friendly and will definitely take care of you.</review>

<review>While visiting friends in Montclair, my wife's Toyota Matrix started leaking under the dash (on her new suede shoes!). We weren't excited about the idea of another breakdown driving from Southern to Northern California, but neither were we excited about going to an unfamiliar mechanic. After research, we found ourselves at Orr Automotive and we're super glad we did.

John treated us right. He walked us through the steps of his diagnosis, took us out to the car to show us his findings, and gave us a discount on additional issues he found 'since he was digging around anyway.' Chris treated us well, too, driving us back to our spot and chatting us up about auto maintenance tips and life in Montclair.

Tl;dr: if you need a diagnosis and solution to a car problem in the Montclair area, go to Orr Automotive. They were kind, knowledgeable, treated us fairly, and acted like they truly wanted to solve our problem affordably and with quality.</review><username>Andrew Biggs< /username><user_id>108835308190567486887<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Orr Automotive kicks A**. The shop fixed my husbands Honda Civic in one day and boy did that car need some work. My husbands car needed brake fluid changed, oil changed, the radiator fluid changed, new tires, alignment and a tune up. I have brought my old car to them a horrible pt loser (cruiser) and that turned out to have electrical problems (got rid of that car). The car I have now is a Honda Crosstour it will be due for service soon so I will bring it to Orr Automotive. They're reliable and   trustworthy and WONT ROB YOU. They NEVER robbed me at all. Believe me I have searched for good and honest mechanics they all robbed and didn't fix anything, finding a good mechanic that actually lives up to its standards is rare. Finding this place was like a needle in the Hay Stack. They will always be the shop I go to.I don't care if I have to drive a long way they have my business till I die. Thank You Orr Automotive !!!</Text>< pics>

My 2002 Mercedes c240 started overheating on Christmas eve, on my way to a friend's house, I did a quick search for auto repairs facilities near the area and Orr automotive was the closest one. Any way to make story short the shop was just about ready to close around 2 pm, guess it was a short day for them after all it was Christmas eve!. Turns out a had a defective coolant thermostat and a damaged radiator hose clamp!!. the guys stayed a little longer just to get the parts and fix my car. and they where happy to do it too, they got me back on the road in no time, my car is still running. and I might add, I have spend more in a single oil change for this same car at different mechanic shop's, then what  I spend that they on the repair. this guys knew what they where doing, and did it fast, and they are good people tooo!!!!.< /review>< username>

Stopped in for pizza and beer on a Saturday night. Both good and drinks were delicious. There is a large outdoor seating area with games. Dog friendly complete with water bowls.<//text>

Several of the item in the menu were sold out and some of their beer also. Overall, it was a good experience the pizza and service were good. I had the Orangutan double IPA Wich was really good.</review>

<text>Came to have a beer with my sister.
Although they don't have a hazy on tap, their Orangutan IPA is a good substitute.
They have a human sized tictac toe game, good tunes, good food selection, (although we didn't eat so I can't speak on the food quality), and attentive staff.
Cheers! 🍻<//text>< Date>

<Text>Fun, low key place with a good vibe for friends to hang. Their old patio has good music and the beer selection is always changing but there's something for everyone. They do have food, but kinda limited. One of my favorite breweries in Sacramento.<//Text>< Pictures>

Great food, professional staff, and great place for brews.  Would like more beer selections - only had 6 IPAs to choose from.  But will definitely be back - the IPAs are awesome.  Go try the Chingona 9% ABV IPA< /review>

Wide variety of beers, all of them very solid. The prices on their pints and growler fills are some of the lowest we've seen in Sacramento. Cruising the Boulevard is a solid, easy drinking pale ale, and was one of our favorites we tried. Very impressed with the quality of the beers. We did not try their food but it all sounded delicious and we look forward to coming back for dinner sometime!<//text>

Great choice of beers and the pork sandwich was great. Pizza was worse then a cheap one you can find in the frozen section, was over cooked and didn't have good flavor. Would go back again for the beer and sandwich. The staff was friendly and helpful.< /text>

Normally a pretty good place to eat but the addition of the new burgers things have changed a bit. The new burger was one of the best burgers that I have EVER had. I liked their beer before but with these burgers this is a major go to place in Sacramento!!!!< /Text>

Fun friendly place. Good food and of course great beer with something for everyone's pallet. Often have event nights from games to trivia and music! If you live near King Cong it will quickly become a fun spot to go for a bit when you want to get out of the but not drive anywhere... But it's also a destination place for a good time. I enjoy it.</review>

It is so nice to have a brewery in the neighborhood!  Their beers are delicious, the food is great, the atmosphere is welcoming, and even when it's busy, the wait isn't terribly long.  Last time I was there it did take a little longer than usual to get food, but it was pretty packed.  Everything came out piping hot and delicious, though, and was definitely worth the wait.  They also have growlers for $8, which is the cheapest I've seen the glass sold for, and the fill prices are totally reasonable.  It's great to be able to take it home!< /text>

< Review>
Stopped in here for a quick beer on a Saturday afternoon and the place was reasonably busy, but we found some seats the bar and tried some brew.  Ended up with their Double IPA "Wellington's Revenge" and it was really good.   Clean and Crisp in flavor.  My wife got their pomegranate Lager and really liked it as well.< /Review>

Delicious brews. The owner is very accommodating and a nice guy. The ambience is relaxed for a brewery and the outside unfolds into a huge area that is a lot larger then it seems from the building. The decor is cool and the they also serve pizza and have a little kitchen there to pick at food when you are getting your drink on. I didnt get to explore the kitchen items but the pizza was top notch.< /Text>

The music was very enjoyable to listen to. They even have a large back patio area with a stage for bands and a few kid games for the little ones, like connect 4 and Jenga!!

The beer is amazing.  Their 12 beers on tap means everyone will find something they like.   They have an excellent Pilsner and many shades of IPA and ales from Mexico.< /Text>

<text>Great beer! Great atmosphere! Great food? Not sure. I was told the kitchen was closed around 2pm because they were “20min behind” and the staff “needed a break”. I would have had no problem waiting more than 20min for food; I see that it’s fairly busy and had plenty of good beer to hold me over. But to deny an order entirely? I’ve worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years and couldn’t fathom refusing to put through an order for one of my customers because it was “too busy”. Busy is a good thing, my friends. Who turns away money?</text><GmapID>0x809ad75ad94a0b6d:0xa8080381f91d8e28<//GmapID>< rating>

So I traveled all the way here form south Sacramento to have some pizza and drinks with my friends, we called earlier asking why time do they stop serving food, they said 9 pm. Well... upon our arrival they said they stopped serving food at 8 because the day was so slow they decided to close the kitchen earlier....

Are u kidding me?!!!!. It’s really frustrating when places do not respect their posted schedules, since people plan around them. It’s double frustrating that you called earlier to double check and anyway they do not respect what they said.< /text>

<Review>Impressive layout, good modern feel and an excellent use of the buildings space. When your first walk in your greeted by the delicious smell of a quality Brewery. Try the Oranutan Double IPA, wicked tasty. Didn't try the Pizzas yet however they did have individual bowled beer nuts, clever and clean.

Eat before you visit.  Beer is good, food poor.  Pizza took over 30 minutes to arrive.  It was dry and overcooked.  Base was more like a biscuit.  Salad was little better.  Didn't eat either and no refund offered.  Won't be going back.  Decor is ok, place was clean and spacious.  So, go for the beer or don't go at all.< /review>

<Review>Eat before you visit.  Beer is good, food poor.  Pizza took over 30 minutes to arrive.  It was dry and overcooked.  Base was more like a biscuit.  Salad was little better.  Didn't eat either and no refund offered.  Won't be going back.  Decor is ok, place was clean and spacious.  So, go for the beer or don't go at all.<//Review><user>116426289630900025449</user><gmapID>0x809ad75ad94a0b6d:0xa8080381f91d8e28< /gmapID><Rating>2<//Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><user_name>Natalia Ferber</user_name>< resp>

<Text>Impressive layout, good modern feel and an excellent use of the buildings space. When your first walk in your greeted by the delicious smell of a quality Brewery. Try the Oranutan Double IPA, wicked tasty. Didn't try the Pizzas yet however they did have individual bowled beer nuts, clever and clean. Support your local Breweries!< /Text></record>

<text>Bring your friends.  Sit in the back on the covered patio. Order a flight. All four beers I ordered were very tasty.  The food was really good. Calizone and stuffed mushrooms. There is a wait for food, but that gives you more time for drinking. Think Europe. Play some games while waiting...Janga, Tick Tack Toe, and cornhole.<//text>< Pics>

My fiancé and I have Sacramento Brewery Passports and though we've managed to get a decent stamps in them, I feel like we often times forget to bring them when we go to a new brewery.  Today we forgot to bring them, but we didn't mind because we will gladly be coming back to this we'll established brewery.  Their selection of brews they have are diverse and unique.  Not to mention their food is unlike most breweries and in the best way possible.  We split their pork banh mi sandwich and and ordered mascarpone stuffed in a fruit served on top of arugula and honey 🔥🔥🔥

So on top of them having great food and beers they have a good outdoor seating area with plenty of games scattered throughout to keep everyone occupied.  One of our new favorite breweries.<//text>

Had decent beer, good food, and friendly service. There were plenty of IPAs but unfortunately not very many stouts, porters, or ales and zero nitro beers. Seeing all of the brew equipment as you walk in is really cool. I thoroughly enjoyed the french mayonnaise and soy sauce pizza. If they added a few more choices for us dark beer lovers I would gladly give it 5 stars.</Review>

New brewery close to home. They have 5 selections, double IPA & pale IPA are the 2 I've tried and they were pretty good. Nice notes, crisp and fresh. They have giant jenga giant connect four, bunch of other stuff to play in the outdoor patio. Great pizza, salad, games, outdoor, beer, family friendly, sodas what more could you ask for?< /Text>

The Banh Mi chicken sandwich was yum, the roll/baguette was equally fantastic. I also had the Monkey Bash Porter. So glad we stopped in on a tuesday evening to check it out. The tent patio out back was set up nicely too, great set up to bring your dog and some friends, and enjoy some awesome beers.<//Text>

<Text>Somewhat primative but ever evolving small brewery with an excellent kitchen and great beer. Pizza/Stromboli based menu with creative and tasty specials (always check the specials board!). Solid regular brews and a regular rotation of experimentals and seasonals.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Not a lot of selection yet but the beers we're solid, food was not unreasonablely priced, they had live music on their very large patio and you could get a great look at their production space, which is always fun. I will be back when I'm in the area.< /text>

Seems to be a new place,  a disorganized one.  Only the bartender handles the register, the line that forms when busy can set you back about 20 minutes.  Beers are okay,  pizza wasn't that great.<//Review>

Super small beer menu, single IPAs good but very similar. Red was the best beer on tap. Good but not great pizza. Cheesy bread was everything though! So good. It's a cute lil startup in a reviving neighborhood. Great staff too. Keep an eye on it.< /Text>

<Text>A cool joint in what I see as a upincoming part of town. The brewery is very will outfitted and has a nice ambiance to it.

I had a hot temper IPA. The beer was solid and I would order it again.  They have a small food menu of pizza, calzone, salads and a few sandos. Prices seem fair and the calzone was enjoyable.

I would recomend this place.<//Text>< gmapID>

<Response>None<//Response><pics>None<//pics><Text>Came in to Togo's today and was very disappointed to see that the owner wasn't wearing his mask properly or wearing gloves. It boggles my mind that a business owner who is handling food for the public to consume would feel so entitled and above everyone to not put people's safety/health first.

He was putting together lots of food orders and ringing up customers; so he was going from handling customers cash or credit cards then to putting a sandwich or salad together without washing or sanitizing.

Living in LA county where the Covid cases are growing at a scary rate every day and seeing this is really disappointing to say the least.</Text>< userid>

<text>I ordered #36, but the sandwich was missing the black forest ham and veggies, plus there was cheddar cheese in it (which isn't supposed to be there.) Hardly any turkey...worst sandwich ever from Togo's.</text></record>

When I walked here the whole counter on the other side had plenty of employees ready to take an order.  I was very happy to know I would not be waiting in a huge line, the staff was able to get through people quickly and get your order done right and get you to your seat so you can actually enjoy your lunch instead of trying to rush through and not be able to taste it until you burp it up later.  This location was very clean and maintained, so overall they did a great job and if you find yourself in the downtown area looking for a good lunch or dinner and do not have a lot of money to spend I would highly recommend this Togo's location.<//Text>

<Review>Growing up with a self taught mechanic, I have never needed a repair shop, nor have I trusted them.  I was so worried when I called to take my car in for a brake repair.

The staff at Sunland Tire Company are top notch. Professional, kind, and willing to go the extra mile to help get the best services for the customer.  They showed my brother and I that our rotors were in decent enough condition, and we didn't need to buy replacements (thank god, that's a huge expense alone) and pointed out some other issues that should be addressed at some point.

They were upfront about what we came to fix, and honest about what could be postponed.  Since the car is rather old, I really appreciated not being harassed about things I wasn't sure about repairing.

The waiting area is lovely and all the charges were explained to me before I paid. I would return to this location for any needed work.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1620316491462, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your review!

I had my car checked by them so it's standard procedure for repair shops like this to charge you a diagnostic fee for finding out the problem of your vehicle. I left my car for I have to go to work and an employee named Peter who seems to be a nice trustworthy guy and an amicable person will call me on what they find wrong with it. Peter calls me back later in the day and tells me what's wrong with my car. To make sure I asked Peter if I he can waive the $132 diagnostic fee if I agree to have my car fixed at their shop. He exactly relied YES and so I agreed to have them work on my car and repair it it to have it in good running condition.

I came back the next morning to pick up my car and pay for the bill. Everything was fine at that point and I went on my way to work. I was about a mile away when I saw the on my bill that the diagnostic fee wasn't waived at all so I went back to talk about out conversation from yesterday about the fee.

So I showed him on the invoice the diagnostic fee and asked why he charged me when we agreed in our phone conversation the day before that it will be waived. Alas he replied to me that he never agreed on the waiver and he doesn't remember that we talked about it in our conversation. I didn't bother to press my point anymore for I am sure I will be wasting my time on a pointless discussion about the fee and just left. Be aware that they will charge you a $132 diagnostic fee even if you have your car repaired at their shop as per company policy which is a rip-off if you ask me.

In all my experience having my vehicle repaired at several repair shops already Sunland is the only shop that charges a diagnostic fee only. Now it is standard operating procedure for a repair shop to waive the diagnostic fee once you agreed to have your vehicle be repaired at their establishment. Even the big companies like Toyota or Ford car dealership have the same system.

Sunland has lost my business because of this BS and even though I still need repairs done to my car, I will never come back to them ever. Be smart and stay away from them.< /review>

The guys were great. I was greeted immediately upon arrival. I let them know I had scheduled my appointment through amazon and gave him the part to be replaced. The service was quick and the atmosphere was inviting. They were super professional and courteous. I would definitely come back here and recommend this shop to anyone.</text>

This place is awesome. It changed hands several years ago and every experience I've had since has been above and beyond. Their work is efficient and top notch. When I went in for new tires, they let me know that I had a bent rim on one of my tires and went out of their way to get a price on a new rim (a part they don't personally stock) for me just in case I wanted to have it replaced in the near future. They also are always willing to check their air pressure in my tires and fill them up if they're low, free of charge. They're so friendly and dependable that when I noticed that I'd lost a screw on my license plate and it was hanging precariously, I went to them for help first. They didn't have the exact screw I needed, but found one that would work and had me put back together and on my way in no time, free of charge. I cannot recommend this place enough. You need some tires? Go to Sunland. Need alignment done? Go to Sunland. Need something more complicated done with parts I don't know squat about? Go to Sunland and get some top rate service complete with a smile.</text>

<review>I recently had all 4 tires on my car changed plus alignment done at Sunland. I had called around for a few quotes and Sunland beat everyone’s price. John and Parker were so nice and took such great care of me and my car. I will definitely be using Sunland again in the future.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I went in with a Groupon for an oil change and came out with loads of information and a tire balance  $30 cheaper than the posted price. I heard the team discussing a problematic car  from the previous day and the manager John responds with "I'll make it right." My head turned like WHOA! As a female you're always worried about being taken advantage of at car places. I was valued, respected, and treated like a human being. Hell, I was even offered the first donut in a new box! Phenomenal! Thanks guys!< /text>

<review>Second time I’ve been here and it was even better than the first!! I came in looking to get 4 new tires and an oil change, and the sunland staff was fast and super helpful! I needed a new part for my alignment and they were able to get it delivered, put on, and tested in an hour! I was walked thru the entire process and never felt stupid or taken advantage of (which is rare when I deal with anything to do with my car). I would recommend this place to my friends and to all the ladies out there that want a friendly affordable mechanic who puts the customer first. THANKS SUNLAND!< /review></record></dataset><record>

My new auto repair shop!   Was looking for a new auto repair shop since I now live in Covina.  Had a recall on my car, they printed out the paperwork for me to take to dealership!  Wow!  Had other work done later, very satisfied with service and all the friendly staff.< /text>

I've been coming to Sunland tires for a little over two years. I'm an Uber driver and I drive full time so I am here frequently. Any service that has ever been performed on my car has always been discussed prior. Anything else that comes up, I've always been notified before the service was done. My Honda Accord came out of the dealership with several mechanical problems. I had many different mechanics in a short period of time who all did me dirty in different ways. It wasn't until I brought my car to Sunland that I noticed immediate results. The car was a 2005 and I put a little over 200,000 miles on it driving for Uber. Luis which is my go to guy has always advised me on future work that needed to be done. I don't know a ton about cars but based on noises or performance of my car I had a pretty good idea and I've never once felt like I was being taken advantage of or cheated out of any money. As a matter of fact if something was ever missed or malfunctioned off a previous repair Luis or Joseph would always rectify the issue at no additional charge. I know drive a newer car and bring it in for routine oil changes and maintenance, and am 100% comfortable and satisfied with the service providedI have noticed that the majority of the negative reviews towards this establishment come from Groupon users. I imagine they are more than likely not understanding how their discounts work or what services are included. I would suggest contacting Luis, Joseph, or Pete. They are all professionals who exemplify customer service. My favorite part. I always get a call 1-2 weeks afterward asking me how my service was. That alone tells me that this establishment cares about its customers and will go out of their way to keep their customers. Keep up the great work guys.< /text>

The mechanics here are very honest and never try to overcharge you. They tell you what needs work now and what can wait. They are not pushy and try their best to work with you and give you the best options according to your needs and financial situation.</Review>

<Review>Found them on Groupon. I was looking for front brakes on my car and felt like it was a good deal. The deal was $79.00 for Front or Rear brake pad replacement. Now that sounds like a good deal so I called and  spoke to Luis over the phone, he said I may have to pay for rotor resurfacing or replacement. Now I have never heard of a brake job if you don't at least resurface the rotor so that is an automatic charge in my book (Only a shady company will do your brakes without at least resurfacing the rotors if they are within resurface specs). So we are now at $129.00. An acceptable price...but wait there is more. Of course OEM parts on my car calls for ceramic breaks, another $45.00 charge so now my $79 job is $174. Welllllll, is this the quote I got from them? Nope our buddy Luis quotes me $200 from his list taped on the counter and offers me a $10 discount( still $16 more than what is listed in the "fine print" on Groupon. And by the way, when I called Luis told me to come in and I did not have to buy the coupon on Groupon. Groupon takes a cut of the total price because they are the ones promoting Sunland Tire Company. Shady?? Maybe maybe not everyone one wants a couple of bucks in their pocket but it is also indicative of their attitude. I am not ready to say they are shady but can confirm they are dishonest and work the bait and switch. I ended up canceling the service and they still charged me 29.95 because they put it on their rack. You be the judge but I would not recommend this shop to my wife, daughter or friend.</Review>< gmapID>

We do the alignments for several body shops in the area so we pride our self on getting them exact.  That said, if there is a problem I would be more than happy to fix it, or if you are no longer in the area we have a nationwide warranty on all our work, the number to call is on your invoice.\nI hope that helps!"}</response>

<review>car engine shut down while i was driving. Took my car to this place to get repair. After running a diagnostics on the car, I was told car needed and alternator and a new battery for a total price of $590.00. The next day car broke down again with same issue as two days before. This time they tell  me the car needs a brand new engine. when ask if i can work out a discount on the amount i had already paid they told me "NO" that this was totally a separate issue.  Don't take your car here if you need any repairs chances are you will go through the same issue as i did. It seems to me that they are only interested in draining your wallet, and don't give a hoot about customer satisfaction..< /review><gmapID>0x80c32844f8d2a66f:0x71e97709eeb10282</gmapID>< Rate>

Ok first time I was working and left car on my. Lunch to change tires. I come after work and it parked ready. Im already happy no wheel studs broke off and bolts was hand torked. I drive away and they did a alignment for me. First thing was wheel not pointing left, car drove perfect! Now im back agen and getting taken care of right away. My car is a 1992 and being treated like a new bmw. Keeping it clean with plastic like a dealer. Getting 4 wheel alignment and happy to spend my money here. Always call first and set appointment they get swamped at times.< /review>

Im a makeup hobbyist and I visit all the time. The store is always clean and organized and for the most part the wait in line isn't that bad. The only downside to this location is that it is never quick or easy to find someone to do a shade match. Its helpful to know what you want because it is not often that a worker will approach you to help you.< /text>

<text>I use to love Ulta! But my last couple experiences have been horrible!
First off, every time I walk in nobody says anything, but yet every single time person that walks in before or after me (who is of different a different ethnicity than me) they always greet them with “Welcome” or “How can I assist you?”
Secondly, every time I ask for assistance with finding a product, the employees either ignore me or they say “it’s not available” without even checking - even though the app says it’s “available for pick up”
Furthermore, I think there should be more diversity at this Ulta(like there use to be) and there should be more people who are willing to help/answer questions.< /text>< Pictures>

<rate>1</rate><text>I picked up my order last Thursday. I’ve never had an issue with this store until now. When I picked up my curbside order, the Hispanic girl that came out, didn’t say hello, she just asked for my ID, I showed it to her and then she threw my order into my car from a far away distance. Now I understand the social distancing and no contact pick up, but there is no reason to throw a customers order the way she did. And to top it off, she didn’t say thank you. I’ve spent so much money is the last week at this store, I don’t deserve my orders be thrown at me. I asked for someone from this store to contact me but no response.<//text>< Pictures>

Staff judge you a bit/ don't help much if you go in looking like college student. If you have full glam makeup on and a great outfit, then only you are greeted at your entry and helped in the store, irrespective of the coins you spend! 4 stars for their rewards program.<//review>

< review>
First off as I was making my way through Ulta store @ 7000 Market Pl Dr, Goleta, CA 93117 between 12pm-1:30pm on 1/26/18 I was appalled at over hearing a store associate speaking negatively about customers within ear shot of myself shopping the store. It was awkward & uncomfortable to say the least. The associate that was gripping about customers stating that she can't get anything done because a customer will walk up and start moving display items around again this person was Deborah at least that is what she stated her name is, but she as well as a few others were not wearing name badges. She is tall, Caucasian, about late 40's, 50 or 60, medium length dark brown/black hair, severe red lipstick on. She did approach me to ask if I needed help, and that seemed insincere especially after hearing her speech beforehand. I said I am looking for an eyeliner by Ulta, and I was in front of Ulta products to which she made it seem like I was well equipped after finding Ulta brand she slyly distanced herself from me. Her co-worker whom she was complaining to however stepped in shortly after Deborah departed. Allie asked if I needed help, I told her yes I am looking for an Ulta duo eyeliner, and Allie actually remembered the product & explained it is a seasonal item then she went on to see if she could find me the plum shade I fell in love with. We both searched and found Mystic Ulta eyeliner to be the best match. I thanked her and continued shopping. I then was trying to find a lip scrub, and was guided by another friendly associate to Pacifica brand lip scrub.  I thanked her and tried the lip scrub out on my wrist and carefully chose the lip item in front that were all opened. As I was testing what clearly was a used Test item, that is when Deborah decided I need a stern talking to. She said I am not allowed to try items on, and I said it is a tester & has already clearly been used many times as such. She snottily said it will say tester on it if it is a tester. I then asked her name, and pointed out that she should then remove all the items in the front that have been opened so no one else buys them and or mistakenly uses them as a tester. She said well then we wouldn't be able to sell them....I was shocked! She clearly could see & I pointed out all the lip items in the front display were all opened way before I got there & all were clearly being used as testers!!! So for her to attack me for not doing her job was quite the opposite of the very Top notch service I always get from Ulta. I got the feeling she doesn't even like her job or customers, and though I had my hands clearly full of items I happily found to purchase she treated me like an unwelcome customer as she clearly can't stand any of us a she stated earlier to her co-worker. So, I get that she hates her job & customers but don't feel she had the right to take out her aggression on me. I have never ever been so aggressively approached by any customer service person Ever!  I am happy to say that this kind of customer service is not my normal experience, and I left happy with the items I was able to find. I am however still horrified that she did not remove the items from the Pacifica line that were all open and being used as testers! That means she will knowingly allow her co-workers to sell used items, and let customers buy from items that were already used in store!</review>

<text>My experience at the hair salon was sub-par.

The reason I decided to try the hair salon at Ulta was because I received via mail a coupon for a $30 cut and style for new guests. It said to book online by 4/19/2017. On Wednesday the 19th, I didn't have access to wifi, so I called and made an appointment over the phone. The woman I spoke to said there were no walk-ins available for that day, so I made one for 1 o'clock the next day (Thursday).

When I arrived Thursday at 1, there was no one at the salon counter. After waiting a few moments, I went in search of an employee. The store was nearly empty, so I found one immediately. She directed me to Cecilia, who was to be my stylist. Cecilia acknowledged me then promptly walked away with some guy she had been talking to. I continued to wait at the salon bar for an extra 5-10 minutes while various other employees asked me if I had an appointment and didn't seem to know where Cecilia had gone. This all happened while on my lunch break, so I was under a time constraint.

Strangely, it wasn't until 3:54 pm that same day that I received a text confirming my appointment at 1 pm. A miscommunication about appointments is  understandable, but I found Cecilia's behavior to be unprofessional.

Additionally, I was not very satisfied with the haircut she gave. I asked for layers and a trim - I said that I don't mind sacrificing a bit of length if it makes my ends look healthier. But after she was finished, I had to ask her to go over certain spots again, because there were still lots of noticeable split ends. She also didn't cut the hair framing my face at all until I specifically requested.

My hair also felt very dry after the blowout. I was curious about the products she used. She used Redken anti-frizz shampoo, which I don't feel was very appropriate for my hair type. I'm not sure what hairspray she used (she wasn't sure when I asked), but it didn't seem to have any heat protective elements. My hair felt damaged after the blowout.

And finally, she was very rough with the way she handled my hair. She neglected to brush out any of the tangles after washing my hair, so each time she made a long pass with the comb, it ripped out some of my baby hairs. I could see them knotted in the comb after she was finished. I'm not usually tender headed, but that hurt.

Disappointingly, I forgot to bring the coupon with me to my appointment, so I paid full price for this negative experience.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>Moderate to strenuous trail to the highest spot in the Santa Monica Mountains (3133ft elevation). There’s free parking available if you input Sandstone Peak trailhead. You could also park at the Mishe Mowka trailhead but that lot was a bit smaller and had more people. There are two bathrooms available at the Sandstone trailhead. You can opt to go clockwise for a shorter but steeper ascent, or counterclockwise for a longer but more gradual ascent. The trail connects to others like the Secret Grotto and the Balanced Rock trail. Note that the latter is a trail that’s not maintained by the NPS so it’s overgrown.

The trail is rocky and to get up to the peak, you might need to strategically rock climb (in the loosest sense). Wear hiking boots, sneakers work give you good traction. There’s little shade so wear sunscreen and bring a hat. Dogs are allowed on the trail. No permits are required to hike. You’ll most likely not have signal so bring a map / check the trail beforehand. Overall, the trail provides a great workout and the opportunity to enjoy some fresh air away from the crowds.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhBUYgv__ZUECMxKPVz1ooE8td_nJnqRCU3v7X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4pkKYb6A0TbAFbwCVK1MSHrQ7FXczA63E4SLy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCjLkZbozpx2_sBjTe3SGUX2DUPx7EBNo86AC4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6SrPALaETpODs3zKO3plfyaA0VR6y3RGO0rIe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNptcSBlU--3HrgLXDJfcDoKiw2dal282TG5Gwh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8kJ6376ztVrh1S5w0Ws8jZrbgSg5bvXVxJ4bV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn3SAZLKY-1FSjpdZl16m37Tkekpe8Mma8ZdoA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX3YkzKFYMTdZMhAMEu6b2SkedmafBNTxqGmOf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxsedvpw9gl55i1iONOA7kE2ypEctbS27K7UWX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8CNtivU3v_DOxMTFhByS9C2AOmzk3TPHHqhF9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNINmrKn-TNUJN6TYZnoEeNqHK9qkyd9JEBRi9q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2iJ4Bgiz7rjVs0gotQxBNrEd9JXD-_FM0yaXD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtUtQguXtG7G4Bd6hkQeMq6xchaIdUlAgyoWaR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn2MjrBVYTnPgJwSypkRJsi-aVIM4gaygOGFba=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

Good trailhead for a morning hike - Backbone trail is longer but the shorter route to Sandstone Peak is much steeper! Definitely doable for active hikers.</review>

< Review>
This was a great hike on a beautiful day!! Make sure to wear some good hiking shoes, bring some water and sunscreen too!! It is only 1.5 or so miles to the top, the trails are pretty nice, a few spots had some loose rocks and a few washouts too. Over all a great hike !! The view from the top is well worth the hike !! At the top is a small statue and a geocaching stop too.</Review>

<text>One of our favorite hikes in LA (Malibu). Highest point in the Santa Monica Mountains. Make sure you sign the book inside the bust. Best time is towards sunset but you will be hiking down in the dark. Be careful rocky terrain. 1.5 miles from parking lot to top. 3 miles round trip.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Best hike in southern California! Be sure to go on a clear day, preferably in the spring. If you're able to do either sunrise or sunset, that's the way to go.<//review>

<Text>Beautiful intermediate trail with spectacular views of the Santa Monica Mountains.  It's definitely worth the drive but note that some of the roads are still being fixed from the fires and are very rough.  Take plenty of water as there is no shade since most of the trees are charred.< /Text>< user_id>

<Review>We hiked here last week and the trails were only one day dry, so they were puddly in spots and sloshy in others but it was cool. The waterfalls and streams sounded awesome. The birds were is full Twitter and the sky was divine. Trail loop was 6 miles and we'll teneded.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>This hike was awesome. We took the more aggressive 3 mile loop because we were a little short on time. Round trip with a 20 minute stop at the top took us about 2.5 hours. It was heavy incline all the way the parking lot to the peak but doable. I had to stop a few times to catch my breath but it was worth it to take in the views. The fast drive up to the trailhead from highway 1 is Yerba Buena turn but for a longer more thrill seeking drive take the Deer Creek Drive.</review></record>

<name>Vic Hanson<//name><Review>Sandstone Peak is the highest point in the Santa Monica Mountains and gives some good views. There are two nearby parking lots off of Yerba Buena Road, the Sandstone Peak Trailhead and the Mishe Mokwa Trailhead. The distance is similar from either one. There are a number of trails but they are fairly well marked but a map can be helpful. The Backbone Trail goes near the Sandsone Peak TH but passes right through the Mishe Mokwa TH. Two other interesting side hikes go to the Grotto (starts across the road from Sandstone TH) and Balance Rock, which is a side trail easily accessed from either TH. It is easy to make a loop hike using the other trails. The Grotto has a nice little pool hidden down among large boulders and Balance Rock is a huge rock standing on top of one on ground level. It is amazing that the earthquakes haven't toppled it!< /Review><Time>1604968869161<//Time>< pics>

Absolutely stunning and beautiful hike. A bit challenging but worth the views. Come early as parking will be hard to find later in the day. This is a popular and heavily trafficked hike.< /review>

<Text>Some of my friends who live in the LA area suggested this as a great afternoon hike. It's not easy but it's definitely not hard. Took about 30-40 minutes from the trailhead to the top. You could extend the hike by either adding more stops or continuing past the peak. The views we're great and I was luck enough to get to see some greenery. Also the drive to the trailhead is spectacular. Take some time and make sure to leave heading down the road towards the ocean, you won't regret it.< /Text>< GmapID>

One of my favorite hikes in the region. It is medium difficulty and it can get very windy sometimes, so wear at least a light jacket. The view from the top is amazing and there are frequent places to stop and enjoy the landscape.< /review>

I recommend continuing to do the whole loop after stopping at the peak. Just FYI we saw a 2 ft rattlesnake on the trail and he wasn't moving. DON'T play with or try to move snakes, just take another route or call it a day. Enjoy the hike and be safe out there!<//text><UserId.>111494877821128425491< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

The drive through here is so beautiful, came up through here to hike at sandstone peak and it was all around a great trip. Beautiful drive, and beautiful hike up to the top. The hike up wasn't so bad and not a hard hike, hike down was even faster. Once you get to the top everyone hangout there for awhile, it's great for pictures and on a clear day you can see so much.<//text>

Sandstone Peak trail leads to the highest peak of Santa Monica Mountains. It is a great hiking trail and definitely one of the best in LA area. It's quite steep so be ready for some great workout. Once you reach the top, the view is absolutely gorgeous and breath taking. If you are into hiking this place should be on the top of your list!<//review>

< Review>
My all time favorite hike in LA and surrounding counties. This is the tallest peak of the Santa Monica Mountain range, what more do I need to say? The whole loop trail is just around 6 miles total, and it is beautiful every step of the way. You start at a very tall elevation, so you get amazing views right from the start. It goes from canyon views, to a balanced rock on a cliff, to the staircase leading up to the monument, reminding you that you have reached the top. The views are spectacular in any direction that you look. On a clear day, you could see as far down as Ventura on the right, and the entire Santa Monica - Long Beach coastline. It is a challenge but no too difficult, so take anyone that hasn't experienced a hike like this before!<//Review>

A great moderate hike! Did the long loop with a group of friends. Great views, plenty shaded spots, including a picnic area and not too many people.

Highly recommend carrying a bottle or two of water and snacks if you go the long way; it takes about 3-4hrs.< /review>

Stunning views of true California countryside. We're beautiful without palm trees and this place really proves it.

From the peak you get to overlook beautiful Westlake from a view that makes you feel on top of the world.<//Review>

<review>Did the sandstone pike hike and wow the views are jaw dropping!!! It's a tad strenuous at times and bumpy along the way but when you reach the summit you will realize it was well worth it. I suggest going in the moring to avoid sun heat and if you are lucky you will have some moring overcast to look below you while you hiking above the clouds. Lastly if you decide to do the side trail to the balancing rocks, follow the signs and when a fork appears, keep right. Left side has elevation and leads nowhere (i made that mistake) it's actually just a runoff trail from previous rain.<//review>< Resp>

< Review>
One of the best hikes in the Santa Monica mountains and even the rest of LA. A fork about 1/2 mile in lets you pick a longer loop (approx. 6.5 miles), or a shorter out and back route (3 miles) that leads to the tallest mountain in Malibu. As you climb, you go through some scenic valleys, shaded tunnels underneath trees, and scenic overlooks offering views of the Conejo Valley.

At the top you'll find a small plaque dedicated to William Allen, a Boy Scout and namesake of the mountain (Sandstone Peak is also called Mt. Allen) and 360 degree views over Malibu, the Pacific Ocean and the Conejo Valley. On clear days you can even see all the way down to Oxnard and Ventura.

The other bonus is it's not too crowded compared to some other Malibu-area hikes, like Escondido Falls.<//Review>

The food no matter how exquisite it may look in the menu and sound on you mouth, it is regular. Nothing impressive.  I was expecting more. Food arrived pretty fast. They have a gluten free pasta & couple of vegetarian options.  Parking is on the street.< /text>< time>

The ambience and location of the place is amazing. The wine list is extensive,  the food was was great, the proportions were surprisingly large.

We expected better from Vigilucci's. The restaurant was very attractive, and the menu looked good. The actual food was average for a decent Italian restaurant, but the prices said they should have been better.< /text>

<Text>Service was poor. Our glasses had dirt in them. We showed this to the waiter and he came back with a dirtier glass. We asked for A1 and they brought an empty bottle. The guy took the receipt from us after a half hour of waiting, once it was convenient for him.

All in all, definitely not worth the price or experience.<//Text>< pics>

On a day trip to Coronado, we were looking for a cute lunch spot near the Hotel del Coronado and decided on this place. What a mistake that was!! From start to finish, everything was terrible. The restaurant was pretty empty, so the fact that the service was awful was just unacceptable. Everything seemed to take forever. After ordering, the food took forever to come out. When it came out, it was wrong. My friend continued on eating her salad even though the dressing was on the side and she had asked for a side of peppers that didn't come (and never came after asking multiple times). I on the other hand, had asked for my dressing on the side and my dressing came fully doused in dressing. When looking around for the server, he was nowhere to be found. I had to physically get up and find him to ask for a new salad. Again, it seemed to take forever for the new salad to be brought out. Nobody came out to apologize and nothing was taken off the bill. After we finished eating and paid, we left as soon as we could. This place is horrible, do not come here!!<//text>

<text>To Jay Deal(Lying in your review), They have cameras, so you know. I witnessed everything and spoke to the staff. You were hovering over the host desk with glass of whiskey on the rocks(definitely not a plastic cup of iced tea).You stayed INSIDE, blocked desk preventing guests from being able to check in. Hostess politely stated "outside food and beverages were not allowed in the restaurant as the restaurant can be fined". You interrupted her, got in her personal space behind the counter to throw the glass violently in the paper receptacle, (which shattered the glass)disturbing guests seated nearby. Then you got in her face to say "excuse me" as if she were in your way. She didn't say anything. GM spoke with you and you said it was a misunderstanding and apologized...Funny how the story changes when you can hide behind a screen and type whatever you want.<//text>< Pictures>

Had the handmade pasta with ragout and it was amazing.  Also tried the butternut squash ravioli hats and they were wonderful.  The bruscetta with prosciutto appatizer was my favorite part of all I would highly recommend them.< /Review>

<pics>None<//pics><review>The piano bar attracted my wife & I here. Waiter was disappointed that we did not order pricey dinners or wine. My wife ordered a raspberry & pear salad, with very little dressing & 1 raspberry. My wife asked for more raspberrys and the waiter brought a dish of them. My chicken marsala was good.
It was very unfortunate, that the piano man had an awful voice and was drunk. This way overpriced and the piano man sucked! Should have gone next door for much less and had pizza.< /review>< Name>

<userid>114263895636824794220< /userid><Review>I hate to give a bad review, but I don't want others to waste their time or money. Where to start...well let's start at the beginning. Drinks at the bar were ok, the wine was good, but the service was, well, let's just say less then friendly. We had dinner in the restaurant, big mistake. I've had better seafood in Tucson, a DESERT (Vivace's is so delicious) my husband had the steak and he didn't enjoy anything on his plate, not even the potato which is pretty hard to mess up. To add insult to injury the service was so absolutely awful. They crammed our party into a super small table. We were positioned so close that I couldn't eat without constantly bumping elbows with my neighbor. We moved our chairs to allow for more room and were SCOLDED! If the food was halfway decent I think I would have been ok with the attitude and left it at that but the ENTIRE experience left a horrible taste in my mouth. Don't waste your money, go somewhere else.</Review>< pics>

We went to this place while on vacation San Diego. The service was fantastic but the food was horrible. One of us had the Penne With Vodka sauce. She didn't eat but a couple of bites. Another in our party had the lasagne, it was terrible and mushy. One had the special and said it was ok. I had the Carbonara. It was probably the best of the bunch but still only ok. I don't recommend it at all.< /review>

< review>
Proposed to my fiancé on New Year's Day at Vigilucci's
I called ahead to make sure they could make her favorite dish (off the menu) and they did a great job with it (penne puttanesca)

The actual pasta here is what makes them so excellent. It has that true al dente bite you rarely find these days

We'll be going back at least once a year to celebrate

Not a cheap restaurant, but perfect for special occasions<//review>

<text>Fair - not great.  We've been going to the original Vig's in Encinitas forever & it's great, but wanted to try the upscale place in Coronado for our anniversary.

Greeted & seated pleasantly.  My wife loves lobster - it's our anniversary - what the hell?  We'd splurge!  Well - They were out of lobster.  We love oysters - they were out of oysters. and a lot of other stuff...  Settled on the seafood brochette & the Cioppino.  Most of the kabob was very good - shrimp good, scallops good, fish good.  Stuffed Calamari looked like a stuffed condom & tasted like rubber stuffed with ricotta.  The Cioppino was fair to poor - some of the mussels were past their prime - the dish smelled like low tide.

The roasted artichoke appetizer was the best part of the meal - very good, as was the crème brulee.

Dinner like this should be great - there should be no highs & lows....

Service & ambience was excellent - just mediocre food.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) The place is very nice, really nice, the service too.
However the food is really disappointing. If you want to test the quality of an Italian restaurant always try pasta with vongole, this is a good indicator. In this restaurant the pasta was tasteless and tasteless.
The salmon tartare starter was well trained. But similar taste, accompanied by avocado and raw zucchini ... The chef should review his seasoning techniques.

(Original)
Le lieu est très agréable, vraiment joli, le service aussi.
Cependant la nourriture est vraiment décevante. Si vous voulez tester la qualité d' un restaurant italien essayé toujours les pâtes à la vongole, c'est un bonne indicateur. Dans ce restaurant les pâtes étaient sans goût Ni saveur.
Le tartare de saumon en entrée était bien dressé. Mais pareil peu de goût, accompagné par de l'avocat et courgette crue ... Le chef devrait revoir ses techniques d'assaisonnement.</text>

They have a wide variety of bikes, gear and more. The staff were very helpful and greeted me as soon as I came in. I was looking to get a new street bike and felt comfortable and not pressured at all. I enjoyed my visit. I’ll be back< /Review>

These guys carry the best bikes for what most riders would be looking for.  Off road or on the street.  The buying process is always easy and simple.  They have an area for you to ride and test the used off road bikes as well!</Text>

<Text>Been in for service work on two different projects. Dept is run like a tight ship. Very professional. You'll be in a queue, but promised times very predictable. BAR# mechanics for peace of mind. Parts department has a good mix of stuff and tires etc. The sales floor is huge with a inventory of new and some nice used bikes. No pressure while look, no touch. I was asked if I had any questions. I replied "Could it be I'm falling in love?"  while hovering near a very new KTM Duke. I've collected bikes for 50! years, but only one at a time. The kawi 500 triple I photographed was an amazing restoration. Not one fingerprint on the chrome, anywhere. If you like bikes, Mach one is worth a visit.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics></record>

I took my recently purchased R6 in to have a coolant pressure check because it was leaking coolant. We received a call and they informed us that they finished the check and the radiator needed to be replaced (very expensive) it was leaking. A couple days later we went to pick it up and the fairings were not on the bike so we drove home without the motorcycle. They said they would drop off the motorcycle to our house due to the inconvenience. The next day we got a call that the delivery guy was unavailable to drop the bike  off so we had to go back and get it ourselves (30 mins away). So we did and took it home and replaced the radiator ourselves for $60. It is still leaking coolant and they must have misdiagnosed the issue.</review>

Honest salesmen and dealerships with integrity are a rarity these days. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another bike from Mach 1, and would recommend the dealership to friends and family.

Update 5/22/21: Today was my 3rd time buying a bike from Mach 1, and it was a great experience as usual! Many people may think dealerships are a pain to deal with and use sleazy sales techniques, but there's none of that with Mach 1. The owner, Jeff, is very transparent about pricing and went above and beyond to help me track down a hard to find bike. It was a quick and easy purchase, and Jeff made sure to address my concerns and meet my expectations. His outstanding customer service and helpful can-do attitude have earned him a lifelong customer. Thank you, Jeff, for helping me buy this awesome bike, and being a trustworthy guy!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x8085734da8384f5d:0x10bfa9c8c64383d9< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I called same day because I had a flat. They made room for me and got me fixed up in 2 hours. They also saw I was running low on oil and topped me off. I've never had such fast and great service.

Brought the Tenere in for a service and preventative maintenance.  The showroom is clean with lots of bikes and some pretty nice vintage stuff to ogle.  Nice parts dept. also very clean and open. Dave in the Service Dept. was very nice, knowledgeable and helpful.  Downside was bike was not ready for several weeks after being promised to be ready in 4-5 business days.  In all honesty it wasn't a big deal for me and the time was near Christmas so I think they got pretty busy with the shopping rush.  Got the bike back running great!  Only downside was my running lights had been removed and put back in a pretty haphazard manner which is going to involve me re-routing wires and placing them back where they belong. (One wire is jammed between the crash bar and body work which will result in damage to wires and body work if it remains where it is) This is probably going to be a 2-3 hr job given I'm going to have to remove the lights and some side panels to re-route the wires.  I did not notice this when I picked up the bike so my bad for not looking more carefully.  A niggling complaint for sure but given the price I paid I was dissapointed. Obviously a rushed job. All in all a good experience and I would go back for service.  I WILL inspect the bike VERY carefully after any future work.< /text>

I highly recommend this place, Mach1 is my go-to shop for service and parts. Best prices on OEM and aftermarket products in the area. If they don't have the part you're looking for, they can get it as soon as the next day. Rick, the main service tech, is very friendly and helped me sort out a problem with a 250ex carburetor. Todd is very friendly and knowledgeable, Jace and James are very helpful and friendly, and the rest of the staff are overall friendly and very knowledgeable. Todd got my drz110 tire done within a few hours of bringing it in. If you are in the area, I would highly recommend checking them out. Great prices, service, and all the employees are amazing. Thank you all!< /Text>

I’ve purchased two R1’s from Mach 1 Motorsports, both at very competitive prices. Jeff runs an outstanding dealership that offers great mechanical expertise and customer service.  Mach 1 is the only shop I trust to work on any of my motorcycles. It’s been my experience work performed by their mechanics is of the highest quality and always completed on the  scheduled time as promised. I always inspect my motorcycle when it’s returned to me and I have yet to see even the slightest tool marks on any of the fasteners let alone marred or stripped contact points which is a given at other shops. I was fortunate to have found this dealership because there are at least a dozen Yamaha dealers closer to me that would have otherwise gotten my business. Mach 1 is 50 miles from my house and was a potential deal killer until Jeff stepped in and offered to have my new motorcycle delivered to my house and would pick up and deliver for any subsequent maintenance or repair work. Jeff is a man of his word and have taken him up on his offer on three different occasions.<//Text>

I love this place, the mechanics are excellent the service department is very helpful and they most always have a smile. The parts department is very cool and helpful. And the sales department is one of the best in the Bay Area if you need help with motorcycles or ATVs. You must stop by and visit the store.<//Review>

These people are incredible! I live far south from here and had been calling every KTM dealer from LA to here trying to find a place that would actually respond to my questions and they were always incredibly nice and quick to respond. When it came time for me to purchase the bike I was originally planning on driving up until my ride bailed and they were extremely accommodating in scheduling a delivery. Best experience I've ever had and the bike is fantastic, thanks a lot James and Jase!<//Text>

service dept is incompetent, i took an engine case half in to have blind bearing removed the guy said he had to put two guys on it and figured an hour and a half at $110 per hour and i had to make an appointment!  well screw that. went and bought tool from harbor freight and pulled it out in my living room in 2 mins.  there is no customer service in this world anymore little things like this is what brings people back for bigger things....never again for anything<//Review>

<time>1490851063402<//time><text>Service department treated me very well. Dave from service helped me out from beginning to end of my service visit - he was straight forward and honest with what needed to be done (helps if you already know where or what needs service). Pricing for labor is a bit high, but I'm not mechanically inclined to trust myself with my two wheels. Overall, a very good experience. I'd recommend calling ahead for service visits so you're not waiting around.<//text><response>None<//response><user_name>Les Carpio</user_name>< Rate>

<Review>Unbelievably good service!!  I bought a used trade in dirt bike for my son at Mach 1 and not 5 minutes into his first ride the motor froze.  Even though the bike was purchased "as-is".  Jeff (owner) and Greg (mechanic extraordinaire) treated me fantastically and now we're up and running.  The service and personal attention was way better than any other shop I've dealt with.  I currently own 6 dirt bikes and buy and sell frequently.  I'll be checking with Jeff whenever I'm looking for a new bike in the future.

Thanks guys, you are awesome!!!< /Review>< pictures>

Jeff is an awesome guy. My brother and I picked up a Honda monkey that Jeff was holding for us. We got there about 30 mins before closing and Jeff did the deal quick and answered all our questions. Jeff and his staff are very knowledgable and their prices are also very good. Also Jeff wouldn't close and leave until we had loaded the bike and secured it. Highly recommended. Thank you and we'll see you soon for more bikes, parts and services.< /review>

<review>Purchasing from Mach 1 Motorsports was a pleasure. No extra/hidden fees or games. Jeff did everything to accommodate me including getting me out on a demo ride (other dealers wanted to complete the sale first then back out of it if I wasn't happy with the bike in the first few miles - crazy!) and picking me up at the ferry terminal. I would definitely purchase from Mach 1 again and recommend them to anyone I know in the market for a bike.< /review>< Rate>

My husband took his Yamaha Road Star in for a transmission recall repair, even though we had not had a problem it was recommended to have this repair done.  When Mach 1 reassembled it they tightened the drive belt way too tight and damaged the transmission.  When we took it back they refused to fix it.   They won't stand behind their work. Also this bike never leaked a drop, since Mach 1 worked on it it's leaking all over the garage floor.< /Text>

I've been a frequent customer at Mach-1 for 3 years.  They treated me well from the start, and service has just continued to improve.  Mach 1 has really helped me out a number of times -- beyond what could possibly be expected. Prices are very good, so it does not cost me to shop locally   -- I basically shop there now instead of online.<//Text>

Helpful and knowledgeable. I will be buying my next bike here. Customer service does a good job of helping fit customers in and parts have mostly delivered when on time. I would send anyone that needs any motorcycle advice, parts, or service here without a second thought.< /Text>

<review>I read the other reviews and thought I would check it out. I did not have a very good experience. I went in the morning when it wasn't too busy. I started to look around and sit on a few bikes when a guy sitting behind a desk across the room yells at me and asks any if i have any questions. I told him I was just looking and thought it was odd that he wouldn't get up and talk to me face to face. Later on I had questions about some used bikes and some new bikes and a few different models so I hunted the guy down. He was sitting at his desk having a casual conversation with someone else totally unrelated to anything. I sat and waited and waited and waited until he finally made time to address my questions. The guy looked up the stats of the used bikes on the computer but he acted like it was a pain in his side. Afterward, he questioned my riding experience and said that the bike I was inquiring about was too much bike for me. I explained that I wanted to buy it, learn it, take it slow and grow into it but he was still very much rude  about my riding experience and capabilities. finally I just left. I will never go back. I just drove up to PCP Motorsports in the Sacramento area and got a better experience AND a better deal

UPDATE:
I got my bike serviced here later on since it was closer to my house and I was limited in time. I made an appointment to get my oil changed along with some warranty services to be done first thing in the morning. I arrived and I was a little early but I didn't mind. The guy checked me in but advised me my technician wasnt in yet and all the other technicians were already assigned to a project. I told him I would wait since I really had no other option. I hung out outside until I saw someone pull up on their motorcycle a HALF HOUR later and leisurely put his gear away. I went inside and watched him chit chat with a few other coworkers for another 10 or 15 minutes before one of them told him he has work to do, and that I was waiting. I'll never go here again< /review>< Rating>

Their email communication is garbage.

James is the fella I was in contact with. Took over a day to respond, and his response was negligent.

He was also confusing a 2018 model with the 2019 model I was inquiring about.

I purchased my motorcycle elsewhere where the staff were actually responsive and knowledgeable.< /Review>

Bad customer service. Walk in with a 710 credit score and 4k to put down. Asked a simple question about getting a 2016 as opposed to a 2017. Dude made some smart remark and i walked out. You lost a sale, dip.

I would never do business with these arrogant clowns.

The guy sitting at the desk literally drives customers away !

50 years of motorcycle riding all over the USA, I have never been treated

so rudely, he clearly was pissed that I dared to walk in this

LOUSY shop. STAY AWAY.< /Review>

< Review>
Guys don’t even waste your time at other bike dealers, unless you have been to MACH1. I have been riding motorcycles for 40 years and have been to over 7 motorcycle dealers in the Bay Area alone and nothing comes close to MACH1 in professional service and just great people working here from parts, service and to sales floor.  You will get the best price here and I just purchased my KTM 500 last night and Jeff, the best Owner/Operator I have ever met, my bike was also delivered free of charge.

I cannot say enough but to say, try MACH1 first, before you head out to other dealers. These people know their business, MACH1 sells KTM, Honda and Yamaha and they know everything about MX and Off-Road bikes to race bikes. Parts and Service prices are also great at MACH1.

I think there is a reason for the name MACH1; you can buy your bike here at the best price with great customer service at a speed of MACH1.  Thanks to Jeff and his very friendly and professional staff at MACH1. You guys are simply the BEST. Thank you.<//Review>

Saturday morning veggie and fruit market with good selection of standard, asian, Indian, south east asian veggies. Was able to find some unique items like methi (fenugreek leaves), arbi, karela (bitter gourd), saag (mustard greens), etc. One of the stalls is family run (Lee farms) and will do special orders if you ask them in advance. I was able to get a large batch of full lemongrass plants and leaves. Only one of the stalls is certified organic and has a wide range of vegetables. Fresh egg vendor, a couple stalls that sell small plants and orchids, and one stall that sells local honey. Great spot to get seasonal fresh items. Check it out!</Text>

Really nice place to pick up your vegetables and stuff on a Saturday. SATURDAY ONLY! They have everything from fruits to bread to vegetables to organic eggs. Asian vegetables like bok choy and yuchoi here are much nicer than what you will find in asian markets. Come early for the best items! Parking is a bit rough , try to park around Millbrae avenue< /Text>

Easy parking, lots of different veggies and fruits. There's also plants and flowers, focaccia bread and honey! Not as big as san mateo but pretty good for local< /review>

<Review>Excellent produce at amazing prices. Less expensive than grocery stores, which pleasantly surprised me. They provide free plastic bags. Sometimes prices are posted, sometimes you have to ask for the price; depends on the vendor. Fruit samples are yummy!</Review></record>

Smaller market with a stall selling focaccia, multiple stalls with produce, a honey stall, an egg stall and a stall selling several varieties of orchids, more than the now common phalaenopsis.  Avoid buying prebagged 10 pound sacks of oranges, despite lower price per pound.  We got stuck with several spoiled ones.< /Review>

Pretty horrible service and they said after I had already paid for a shake that they didn't have the flavor I wanted.  The fries were good but the burger is so small.  For over 20.00 for burger, fries, drink and shake. Not a good deal at all.<//Review>

Excellent service. Food was so so. Fries were good but 7.45 for a small single patty was a lot of bun and little meat. In and Out is better value and taste. Next time its the other guys sorry Five Guys.</Text>

Five guys is great for something different if you like burgers . If you download the app ( and I suggest you do ) you can tap a burger just the way you want , it tells you where to go and when to be there , and if you choose curb side they bring it out so you don't have to leave the safety of your vehicle. Good food< /Text>

<text>They messed up mine and my husband's order, the meat didn't seem to taste correctly cause we had stomach aches afterwards. Our Burgers were Re-made the correct way except for the bacon on my Husband's had been broken up and not straight across like before plus it was less amount of bacon as well. We ere told the burgers that were made incorrectly to just Throw Away in the Trash.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>Haven't been to a five guys since I was stationed on the east coast in Virginia. The energy and professionalism was outstanding. I was enjoying the fries so much by the time I got to my burger they forgot cheese. I showed them my receipt and they happily made another one. Still got to enjoy the fries still warm. Will think about coming here more often. 😁< /Text>< Pictures>

Hey hey! Just drove 20 min because it’s worth it!.. normally. All 5 Guys patrons know the large fry is absurdly large. I bought two large fries and some burgers for the fam this weekend and got home to see what appears to be the equivalent of half an order of 1 large fry... for the price of two. I’ve got pics lol.

<Review>I purchased 4 burgers and a large fry. The fries were dark so I tasted one and it was indeed burnt. I asked for new fries and waa told that the grease was just changed and they would come out the same. Its was 30 min to closing I doubt the grease was just changed. I asked for them to not fry them so long. He still refused to take back the burnt fries. I asked for the info of the storr manager. He said it was him....couldnt be! To argue with me and serve burnt food is unnecessary. I have never had burnt food from the one in ElkGrove. My girls wouldnt eat them we threw them in the trash.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Not usually one for thos type of burger joints but it is way better than McDonald's or Burger King. Must say I was very surprised at how many options you get to build your burger 🍔 the menu was not crazy big so made it easy to decide on a burger but the toppings were plentiful lol Cajun fries 🍟 got a large way to many fries 🍟 for one person next time gonna add a milk shake on to it</Text><user>112793866288787861084</user><Response>None<//Response><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Burgers are really good, and so is the fries. They are just on the pricy side. Plus I wasn't a big fan of all the extra greesy fries on the bottom of the bag. But as I understand it some people love it. And look forward to having extra fries for latter.< /Review><Date>1597859691037</Date><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgIawexyDCey8eeVyiL9f_oeP19-I_BqdYP3Q_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><user>104837734288666248355</user>< Resp>

<Text>My favorite burger place now. The burgers are always fresh and the bacon is crispy. The fries are soft which I love. The regular sized fry is so big you can split between 2 people.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHQNCjufAm5qQNdxyEt0Y1e4A6XSf8aRa1XaGu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgvGSuLUfUWBaT9EaYyEsR_yAutZdY6trkAGAH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZ_mPsbe0N-UHCUiZXtkLO0MRjBMIlZHKBv4Tg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

Burgers are good but fries are the best ever. They are using Idaho potatoes and prep with peanut oil. You should try that. Don't forget to ask for your free fresh 🥜 lol.<//Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>I have been here twice since they opened and it is just not good. Not sure if it just this location or five guys is just different than I remember. Food is expensive. You get a lot but it is just not that good. Just because you take pride in cooking with peanut oil does not mean I want to drink peanut oil. Everything is sopped with grease. Fries and burger can literally be rung out. Not really any seasoning. Just going to wait in the In n Out line next time.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><GmapID>0x809add83e782c541:0x7de9ceb25aa50fa<//GmapID></record>

Not coming back. They didn’t ask if I wanted anything on my burger and I guess they typically don’t put anything on them because I got home and my burger was just meat!! No sauce, no tomato, nothin! Extremely disappointed.<//Text>

An overall rating of three stars; however, I'd rate four stars for the double cheese burger and cup of fries. I sat outside for a while before having to walk in and get my meal. Not sure why they didn't call my number outside since there are speakers playing music. It was a Sunday  so the place wasn't busy enough to be called. Other than that the staff was polite. Not sure I'd go back again since it was $15 for a double cheeseburger, fries, and water.</Review>

I was a little surprised at the price, just over $20 for a burger, small fries and a shake. The food was really good but not twice as good as In and Out Burger. I visited late afternoon on a Friday, there was one other customer so my meal was freshly prepared. The store was really clean and well kept and the staff was friendly and provided great service. I think if Five Guys could come down on their prices they would stay busy like In and Out, that place seems to be packed at any place I go.</review>

I'm an Uber Eats driver and long, hot days are draining. I was offered a drink as soon as I walked in. A simple gesture, yes, but it was nice to be taken care of like that. Daijana is proof that there are still happy workers in this world. This was the first place I ever had five guys and if I lived closer I would definitely visit more often.<//Review>

Fantastic customer service from the ladies at the register. It was our first visit and they took the time to explain the ordering and make recommendations. They use peanut oil and have bins of free peanuts to snack on which is a nice touch.

The restaurant is new and pretty clean. The bathrooms were spotless. It wasn't too busy at lunch on a Saturday, and the wait for food was only about five minutes.

The fries are delicious and come out piping hot! They are heavy handed with the salt, so if you're sensitive you may want to make a special request.

My daughter loved the plain ketchup hot dog. My husband had a bacon burger with mushrooms that was great. My cheeseburger was just ok. The meat patty was well seasoned and it came out hot. My complaint is there was only a scant bit of BBQ sauce. I had to look to see if it was added because I didn't taste it in the first bite, so only 3-stars for now.<//text>

<rating>4< /rating><review>The food is really good,  the burgers are amazing. The fries are consistently too salty but they're really good if you rub the salt off. The biggest con for me is the prices are exorbitant.  $9.21 for a hamburger is a little much. I pay less at a fine dining place with a server. I paid almost $26 for 2 cheeseburgers and 1 order of fries.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Caught a late lunch here with a friend.  Staff was very friendly, took good care of us.  The food was good and I forgot how big the "Little Fries" is.  The burger was great.

The dining room had not been cleaned, every table had some sort of crumbs or other post lunch mess.  Staff didn't get to cleaning them until we were just about to leave.< /Review></record>

<review>Staff is very friendly. I have eaten at Five Guys before but not this location. I am from the East Coast. So my first experience with the merchant was in Baltimore Maryland. While I was attending culinary college. The one thing I like about Five Guys was the burger....juicy...and wonderful flavor. Then I noticed how fresh the fries were when they were cooked. So this is an all around favorite for me with alot of memories attached.
I am a dasher...so I visit this location frequently. The staff are always so friendly and polite. Thank you.</review></record>

All of my food is wrong wrong wrong. Don't order DoorDash from them especially during the pandemic you’re going to spend a lot of money they’re going to screw your order up and they just gonna tell you to figure out how to fix that. I have four shakes in front of me I have no idea what’s what. I would never order delivery from five guys again in my life and I’m never ever having DoorDash deliver my food God bless you both< /Review>

This was my first visit to this burger chain that has seemingly unseated In-n-out as the nations most popular.
The service was great. The young lady that helped us was patient in explaining the menu board, so we were able to make a choice.
I chose to have my burger the same way I get it from In-n-out so I could easily compare.
The good thing about Five guys, even though it's a little more expensive is that the burger is more substantial and therefore I felt more satisfied.
And it was a tasty burger (read that with Sam Jackson's voice in mind).  And I also think I might like the fries better.
But to be honest, the In-n-out burger is more flavorful. In-n-out actually makes you want another burger, which is a good strategy.
But the Five Guys burger makes you feel like you wanna come back...on another day.
And I will be back.
But, no offense to this particular location, I'm still a In-n-out guy.</Text>

<text>I always enjoy stopping at Five Guys on my way home from Choir Practice on Thursday Nights!

Great,  Fresh Premium Burgers!

Me and Nona really enjoy our Thursday Night ritual!

And the young people that work there are all progressive forward bound individuals. It is evident that they'll all be headed to great productive lives and careers!

It close, I think it's a great place!
My Highest Recommendation!

Been a couple years since I've been to a 5G, but it was a bit more expensive than I remember.  Large condiment selection provides good variety from the otherwise basic menu.  Taste/quality is pretty good for a simple burger joint and helps justify the price. Service was fine and free peanuts while you wait.</text>

Food was fabulous.  Only problem was the scanner declined my CC twice. Had to pay cash.  Other customers were not having the same problem and my CC company said there was no attempt to charge anything, so I can only assume the scanner wasn't working quite right.<//Text>

OMG, being an ex-burger flipper I'm very picky about my burgers.  That's why I love Five Guys burgers & frys.  Everything is fresh & the amount of toppings you get to pick from is hard to beat.  If you get fries try them cajun style, the seasoning is awesome.  Try them out & fall in love.  Just FYI, they're expensive.</review>

I enjoy their food.  However 3 of the 5 times I used doordash my order was wrong.  I didn't get what I paid for and they each blame the other.  Now I no longer use a delivery service.  I just started weight watchers and my limit is 25 points.  I just looked up how many points for my favorite combo at 5 guys and it's 39 points.  Also, write on the bag the name and address  when using a delivery service and staple the bag shut.< /Review>

Ok.  Two cheeseburgers and two fries.  All for only $28.  Drinks were extra.  Their regular hamburger is actually a double patty that they don't tell you about ahead of time (presumably so they can charge you more for it)..  We won't be back.< /text>

I tried 5 Guys in The SF bay area years ago when it first appeared. I bought the hype and went in and can honestly say that I want impressed with the $20 Burger, fries and soda.

This location is now my go to after 2 visits if I want just a good old greasy hamburger. Good job Sunrise Five Guys!</Review>

My all time favorite burger these days. Try their low carb burger bowl with everything.  So good! Actually tried their hot dog the other day, tasty! Enjoy peanuts in shells while you wait for your fresh hot hamburger.<//Review>

<review>The price is laughable at this place. I ate a meal on my own and it was something close to $20... I mean I ate 1 burger 1 fry and 1 drink. Anywhere else the price is half of that... Shop elsewhere because the taste isn't the greatest either...</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Text>As with most food chains, there is a consistency in the quality of food. Five Guys is no exception, the quality of food is good. Unfortunately at this location, the customer service was lacking. It was clear the employees were not interested in your satisfaction, or that they even wanted to be there. Hopefully it was just a bad day, and not normally like this.< /Text>< pictures>

The prices are a joke. 9.50 for a burger with no fries. No cheese. No drink. Good burger. Never eating there again unfortunately.</Review>

<Review>By far my favorite place to eat. The fries are delicious, and I often stop in after work for some. They always add extra fries into the bag, which is a bonus! The employees are always super friendly, and help create a good energy. There are free salted peanuts available to eat as one waits for food. It often takes a while for food to come out (about ten minutes, which is longer than most fast food joints,) but if you can spare the time I would definitely try it out. All burgers are from grass fed beef, and have thick delicious patties. The price is a little expensive, but well worth it.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Every time I go to Five Guys I'm not disappointed.  If I want a burger and I can get there, it's my favorite.  Their grilled vegetables make for a good burger that you can't find anywhere else.< /review>

I thought the cajun fries were good and the hamburger tasted fresh but it's overpriced compared to other places like in n out or the habit which IMO have a burger equally as good. Five guys does fries better though but there's no reason they should cost that much. Worth a try.</text>

<review>I love this place.  There is always plenty of room and i have never waited in line to order.  They do make everything after you order it, so it does take a little while, but they have a FANTASTIC app where you can fully customize you order.  They also have a group order function, so you can have a whole bunch of people order from the website and it will also be marked with their names--it is really quick and easy to use. Oh, and the food is really good and they have built in low-carb options.  I also like the soda machine--it is one of those  highly customizable machines.  Also, they are always friendly and the place is always clean.  Parking is pretty easy and it has quick access from Sunrise.< /review>< UserId.>

<text>This was my first experience at Five Guys. I went in with very high expectations because I've heard some hype over the last year or so. The menu is fairly simply but ordering is not very streamlined. The burgers are also confusing for a first-timer. A "little burger" just means one Patty and a "bib burger" means two patties. Seems like an odd way to market ones food. I wanted one patty but ordering a little burger seemed like I was asking for something I didn't want. Anyway, burger was good, definitely didn't live up to the hype. The staff was friendly and the price was reasonable. In the future I think I'll just drive past and go to In'N'Out (or even Carl's Jr).<//text>< pictures>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>The burgers are great, and I like the free peanuts on the table. I like too much salt, but when I tried the fries, I met my match. I only ate about a third of them when I started getting sick from the overdose. When you get sick eating some place, the bad memory sticks with you. I don't think I can make myself go back.<//review>< Pictures>

Great burgers. If your looking for the $.99 deal this place is not for you. Burgers run about $8+ here. If you dine there help yourself to some peanuts while you wait for your order.< /review>

The burgers we're really tasty, and the regular sized fries were hot, fresh and big enough to share. The cashier was also very friendly. If I had a complaint, it would be the meal was a bit expensive, at $30 for two burgers with drinks and one regular order of fries.</text>

<Review>I wasnt aware of their burgers all being doubled unless you ask for a jr.  The staff was friendly  when they realized they had customers but they were not helpful they did not suggest or offer anything. And my burger was very bland with no taste cheese.  So not impressed and $17+ for a burger sm fry and small drink ... I don't want to go back it was a RIP off...</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Clean place to eat, fast and friendly service. Ordered large fries. Fries were cooked a bit inconsistent. Some were crispy and some were soggy but they did overfill the cup by a good margin.  The taste itself felt like mediocre Cajun seasoning. Nothing to rave about.  For $7 I expected much better consistency and taste or have it loaded with other thinga.  Overall I'd rather go to mcdonalds or even kfc for their potato wedges when I'm craving fries.</text>

Equal to In and Out burger but the price is higher than in and out.  But, the hamburgers and fries are delicious.<//Text>

< Review>
So the fries are great, the burger is completely underwhelming. It doesn't have the same pop that an in-n-out burger does. Really didn't like the color scheme inside either, stressed me out.</Review>

<Text>wow, maybe i am the only crazy person here but, this place at best ok, why?
well the burgur is ok the fries are highly seasoned if not salty, the hot dog i had was also very salty but ok. my biggest complain is the PRICE!! omg i am not a cheap person by any stretch but i ordered 2 little burgers large drink and large fried total tally $28 dollars!! are u kidding me!! for a damn burger that is insane, am sick of companies trying to get rich fast this seems to be one of them, also they wer not really busy and it took them for ever to give us our order, honestly for the price and quality  IN AND OUT still the king by far! this is the first and last time i will come and spend my money at five guys unless they become more competative price wise.<//Text><Rate>2</Rate></record></dataset><record>

This was our first visit to Five Guys; visited the one in Rancho Cordova, CA. Burgers are ok but very over priced. My wife's order was wrong not once but twice. She wasn't a happy camper !<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is delicious in the authentic hamburger that burns the hamburg after ordering.
In addition, French fries used raw potato and were very juicy and delicious.

(Original)
注文してからハンバーグを焼いてくれる本格ハンバーガで美味しい。
また、フレンチフライが生のじゃがいも使っていて、とてもジューシーで美味しかった。<//Text>
